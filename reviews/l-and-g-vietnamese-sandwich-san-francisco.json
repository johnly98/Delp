Saigon Sandwich and L&G Vietnamese Sandwich are two that are literally across from each other. After trying out Saigon Sandwich, I decided to give L&G Vietnamese Sandwich a try.\n\nThis is another small primarily to-go restaurant, but I think it has a couple of seats inside. At the peak lunch hour on Saturday it looked like they had just opened and there were a couple of people standing inside waiting for something. I did the same. After about 10 minutes of so they started taking orders. I think they were waiting for the bread or protein, can't be sure. Anyway the menu again is pretty simple a couple of different types of sandwiches including BBQ pork, BBQ chicken, meatball combination etc. Most of the sandwiches are around the $4 mark with tax.\n\nI got the BBQ Chicken sandwich and soon was on my way. The sandwich was neatly packed but it was haphazardly put together. The French roll was not crunchy and the chicken had a weird smell. Overall this was an average sandwich.\n\nI decided to give L&G another try but this time found that they had been closed due to a health code violation. That's when I decided no more tries, I'm sticking with Saigon sandwich which is just across the road.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I've never seen L&G before, but it's been a while since I've been to this part of town so the following weekend, we returned and got our fix at Saigon Sandwich, and also proceeded to L&G to try out their Banh Mi for comparison. \n\n**Warning** \n\nDepending on what part of Larkin you are on, you might need some respiratory mask to get there since the stench of urine is overpowering along with used needles strewn everywhere on the sidewalk so better be careful where you walk.\n\nAfter passing that gauntlet, I walked inside and their menu was posted on the wall on top of the counter for everyone to see. The menu is simple and I ordered a Combination and BBQ Pork to go. There were three other people in front of me waiting for their order, but I didn't have to wait too long once they started my order. 2 orders of Banh Mi sammiches for under $8 is a bargain. \n\nI returned back to the car and Wifey and I drove to Fort Point to enjoy our sammiches with a view. (Note: We also ordered the same types of sammiches from Saigon Sandwich for comparison as this was some serious scientific data that we were dealing with.) \n\nSo, we tried both their Combination and BBQ Pork and they were good. We were not particularly wowed by the taste, but it was better than decent. But for the price point, it's definitely worth it. The size is decent, the ingredients are fresh and the portion is appropriate. They don't skimp on anything, but since we were comparing sammiches, they were behind in flavor and sauce compared to Saigon. \n\nOverall, a decent meal for a good value that's easy on the wallet.\n\nSolid 3 1/2 stars.", "author": "John G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-28", "description": "First of all the value is unbeatable. One of the very very important thing to me is value. I believe this is one of the cheaper, if not the cheapest banh mi place around here. $3.75 for 1, after 10 banh mi you get the 11th FREE. If you're a banh mi fiend like me you'd get to your 11th pretty instantaneously.\n\nAnyhoodle. Tastewise it is not the best. I am utterly spoiled for being back in VN for a whole month recently and almost every morning I had a banh mi in my face. So this is not as good. It's also not as good as Ba Le in Boston, nor the various bm places in Houston. But for SF it's actually pretty good. I actually -PREFER- their special combo here to Saigon Sandwiches. \n\nFirstly when I'm not in VN, my go-to banh mi is the special combo. \nWhat I want: generous heaping of pate, good meat to veg ratio, perfect toasted banh mi (real real baguette)\nWhat I get here: lil bit of pate, meat and veg overload - like soooo much stuffing it cannot be contain in one simple vessel, and not the exact baguette style I'm use to. I mean it's not bad bread per say but it's not your typical banh mi (traditionally). The bread is more toasty, harder than tradition. To many others they probably enjoy it and doesn't mind but I'm a bit obsess with banh mi so I'm a tad disappointed. Meatwise I find that pinkish ham to be endearing, it taste good, I don't mind it. It have a good bit of crunchy cartilage really add some character to your banh mi. \n\nSo their special combo get a 3.5* for LOTS of meat and veggies, lil pate, but not my fav bread\n\nBBQ Pork is meh. Unfortunately it to me a bit of a one-note. You get very bored of it very quickly. Can not finish the whole banh mi (THAT IS NOT TYPICAL FOR ME). It was my fault because when I think of BBQ Pork I thought of : CRISPY PORK (a beautiful banh mi movement in VN currently) something I can never be bored of. This is not that. Again normal people probably digs it though. 2/5\n\nVietnamese Coffee: combo with any banh mi = cheaper, forgot how much but CHEAP. Don't worry about it. I'm not a coffee drinker, I like my VN Coffee flooded with Condense milk. I guess regular coffee people would like this but I had to put like a bucket (not literally) of condense milk when I got home. LOL I'm pathetic (?)\n\nNormal, quick service. In and out for your banh mi in t-minus 5 minutes. Never any sort of wait. \n\nBiggest dilemma was is this a 3 or a 4 star. For SF standard it's a 4 or above, I mean I'm trying many different banh mi places where this one may not taste the absolute best (of SF) but the value is so incredible it will be my go to banh mi place.  (TBH still better tasting and better value than Saigon Sandwich tho ~) But for my true core obsession with banh mi and my very peculiar taste per say it's a 3 star.", "author": "Quynh Nhu D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-03-09", "description": "There are several places in the neighborhood to grab a cheap sandwich should the urge strike you. Lee's around the corner, Balo, and most notably Saigon Sandwich. \n\nThat is there are plenty of choices if you eat meat. If you don't, your options are severely limited. Saigon doesn't offer a Vegetarian sandwich. Lee's dry shredded tofu is a piss poor alternative. Balo is okay but not in the same league as the new kid on the block. \n\nWhile L&G ain't all that new, it is new to me. When SF Vegan Elite Lanie L. shared a photo of her banh mi, I was like damn that's what I've been missing!\n\nI ordered up the tofu sandwich without mayo. I wasn't sure what to expect. When the lady handed me my warm toasty banh mi I was in for a treat. It survived the 15 minute drive back to the office and was still nice and warm when I unwrapped it. Soft, yet crunchy bread. Crispy and fresh veggies with just the right amount of tang. She went buckwild when I excitedly said yes to jalapenos. The tofu however is what makes this banh mi special. It's not even really soft tofu as I was expecting. It's more of a faux meat if anything. Whatever it is, it makes a helluva sandwich.\n\nI've tried banh mi from just about everywhere in SF and nobody makes it quite like this. For $3.50 you cannot beat it anywhere! It's also much more hearty than I remember the competition being. When I used to eat Saigon, I always needed to supplement with something else. This good sized sandwich needed no supplementation. \n\nThere was no line when I arrived at lunch time. Unlike certain places around here I was not rushed to order. You can also order online and pick up at your convenience. There's even a stamp card should you plan to become a regular here. The service was good and less hectic, and there is even a table or two should you want to savor your sando here, rather than being harassed outside by all the drug addicts. \n\nSure they may have a sketchy health score but who cares! It adds to the appeal. I'd rather pay $3.50 for an actually Vegan banh mi from a hole in the wall instead of $8 from a fancier, cleaner establishment.", "author": "John B."}

I decided I need to check this place out. I checked Yelp to see the reviews and notice a sign with bad health inspection score, which made me feel kind of skeptic to try it out. The reviews look good though and I see a friend's post praising how great the sandwiches and friendly the owner treats their customer. \n\nMy go-to banh mi is always been Saigon Sandwich and today I wanted to try something different for a change. I notice that L&G Vietnamese Sandwich was diagonal across from Saigon Sandwich. I went in around late afternoon and came in to ordered two combos with no pepper and one chicken sandwich. It was an affordable price for $3.75 for one and you get a stamp card for free after you buy 10 sandwiches. The wait was about 5-10 minutes, not too long. The owner put the sandwiches in the bag and I gave them cash. When I got back home, I notice all my sandwiches are all combo and the only one is without pepper. They must have switch the order with the couple in front of me because I ordered one chicken and two combos with no pepper.... :(( I was hungry, so I did not really care much. The combo was pretty good like any other combo I ate. There wasn't much MSG that made feel thirsty afterward like most banh mi sandwiches, so that's a plus. A lot of stuffing of veggies with carrots, daikon, cucumber, and etc and a good portion of pork stuff in the sandwich. \n\nIf there is something I would fix about the store is the interior design to be more print letters (instead of handwritten like Chipotle Pulled Pork and Broiled Pork...and the price for other things) and fix the broken crack on the door would be nice :) Or change the interior to be more minimalistic for better health inspection score...

The sandwiches were delivered to us toasted and packed with pickled veggies and chicken. The mayo wasn't overpowering nor flowing all over the place. \n\nI really enjoyed the flavor of the chicken. It's a bit more barbecued/grilled? A teeny bit spicy. Loved it. I've only had their Vietnamese ice coffee before, but I bet the sandwich and coffee combo would be stellar. \n\nChicken Banh Mi is only $4. It's a good sized sandwich too, not diminished in size, value and taste as Saigon Sandwich", "author": "Elisabeth H."}

Grabbed some take out for dinner.\n\nVietnamese sandwich:\n*Special combination ($3.50)\n*BBQ chicken ($3.25): add Pate\n\nI loved the special combination. Lots of pate which I adored. I added pate to the chicken sandwich as well. I don't believe they charged me for it as I only paid $6.75 altogether. Both sandwiches were delicious! The bread soft, but with a nice crusty chew. The veggies were pickled nicely and the peppers had a nice kick.

The store was not crowded at all, and the family that runs it is super friendly. The mom makes the sandwiches and her son is the cashier.  \n\nThe meatball bahn mi is probably one of the best I've ever had. The bread was very crispy, and the pork meatballs were piping hot and were moist and tender. The sandwich was topped by a heaping pile of pickled vegetables.  Strangely, the meatball sandwich doesn't come with pate, so I ordered it with pate for an additional 25 cents. The meatball sandwich with extra pate and a can of grass jelly drink was just $5.  Where else can you get an awesome meal for $5?? That's an incredible deal, but more importantly the banh mi was delicious and I'll definitely be back.", "author": "Allen T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-14", "description": "This is my go-to for Vietnamese Sandwiches, which is saying a lot considering all the options there are in the Tenderloin, and even out in San Jose. The lady and her husband are extremely nice, and I believe she used to work at Them Ky around the block on Ellis, which previously had really good sandwiches, but I haven't been back for a while. Anyway, the highlights of this place are definitely the combination (Dac Biet) and the Banh Mi Ga.\n\nThe combo has 3 meats, a headcheese pork, bbq pork, and steamed pork cake, just as traditional combos have. The pate on the sandwich is quite good, and not overpowering or containing a lot of MSG. The chicken sandwich, in my opinion is better than Saigon Sandwich nearby, as the meat doesn't require any sauce to be poured over, and is marinated well with many spices. One of the best parts however, is when the sandwich is eaten fresh while the bread is still warm from the toaster. Their bread is a traditional french roll/baguette, but some of the stuffing has been ripped out. As such, you get a nice crispy outside, with just enough warm dough, while avoiding the heavy feeling of eating dense bread. \n\nThe Vietnamese drip coffee (Cafe sua da) is quite good and strong, and is very quick because she has multiple french presses set up to drip so the coffee can be prepared quickly, unlike in most restaurants, where waiting for your coffee to drip can take ages. This place also has weekly specials, such as bun bo hue, and other things, which will be posted on a sign outside the door. I've also tried the spring rolls (Goi Cuon) and they are very tasty, because she uses marinated and grilled pork and chicken(Thit Nuong and also Ga), so you don't really even need the peanut sauce, although it's pretty good with it as well. Overall, a nice experience every time I come in. \n\nSome tips: If you want a little extra flavor, ask them to put Maggi soy sauce on the sandwich. They have stamp cards for a free sandwich after 10.", "author": "Jonathan D."}

I also think this is the cheapest banh mi that I've found anywhere in SF if not the Bay Area. For the price, this was pretty bomb. \n\nBeing new, it's also fairly new inside. Upon entering, I was greeted by a very cheery aunty with a side smile. I ordered over the phone about 2 minutes earlier, and my order was ready for pickup by the time I arrived. There wasn't much of a line either. The prices looked like they dropped 25 cents from the photos I saw online. I wasn't complaining. I was briefly tempted by the snacks and desserts strategically placed in front of the cash register, but resisted and quickly paid the cash in exchange for my two sandwiches. Got a brown bag and some napkins to go with them; what a steal. \n\nThe friendly aunty said thank you not only when I paid, but also when I exited. She's got my vote for sure. \n\nThe sandwich was decently sized with the right type of bread. A quality banh mi for the price paid. As I leaned in for a bite, I slightly missed and the crust of the bread scratched my lips -- oow! That was one seriously toasted bread.

After a very average batch of sandwiches (I bought 4 at once and had to bitterly eat my way through them) I decided to try a couple of other places to see if anywhere was better.\n\nI stopped as soon as I got to L&G - mission over! As soon as I took my first bite I couldn't stop smiling because THIS WAS IT. I haven't had a banh mi this good since I moved to the US! The buns are generously filled and the carrot is perfectly tart (which I feel SO strongly about and is SO hard to find here - most places err on the sweeter side). I always get the combo because it's what I grew up with.\n\nThe lady who works here is super sweet, they accept credit (!!!) and the loyalty cards are the icing on the cake. I'd still come here if the service were surly and cash-only but it's just nice that it isn't, you know?\n\nThis is by far the best banh mi I've had in San Francisco.

I'm no stranger to ban mi and I have to say the L & G totally knocked it out of the park!  First of all, the roll was of proper size and arrived perfectly heated absolutely stuffed with meat and pickled veggies (a nice touch was a thinly sliced cucumber pickle along with the usual carrots and onions that had just the right amount of sweetness) and extra jalape\u00f1o if you wish.  To add to this, they have a punch card good for a free sandwich with every 10 you buy and at $3.75 this has to be one of the best deals in the city especially for the size ban mi you get.  As a side note, the people who own the shop are really nice too.  I absolutely recommend giving them a try!", "author": "Tom K."}

It's a modest shop, clean with a few seats at the window-side counter. They sell a few other homemade goodies like your typical fresh rolls and even oily rice. The sandwich here is made using baguettes that I'll say are the most traditional in terms of size and texture compared to the others (based on my vast experience of having consumed banh mi at only maybe a dozen restaurants in my lifetime, so not saying much). My biggest gripe with Lee's was their roast pork; here, the roast pork has good consistency and flavor and, while not as overwhelming in quantity as at Saigon Sandwich, you get a good amount of protein between that, the pate and the pork roll. While the veggies don't come pickled, they sprinkle a little vinegar on your sandwich which offers the proper acid to cut the protein and fat; the added kick from the dash of either soy or Maggi sauce nicely complements the mayo. If you're at this intersection and looking for the best traditional pork combo based on proportion of ingredients and overall taste, my money goes to L&G.", "author": "Gene C."}
