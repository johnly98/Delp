I FINALLY got around to going Saturday lunch time with my dad. I kind of half wish I hadn't, because I don't know how I'm going to stop myself eating here every day. \nWe were the first customers of the day and they weren't finished setting up the dining room yet, but we were welcomed so warmly. My dad was convinced to have a beer - they were only $4 because, I guess, it's FiDi at the weekend. \nWe ordered imperial rolls and fresh shrimp rolls to start. They were good and super fresh, however the sauce with the shrimp rolls was quite bland. I wish it had either been a stronger peanutty sauce or stronger flavours in the roll (maybe cilantro?). I don't know. Something was missing. \nBut then it happened. Number 22. Curry noodle soup. It was incredible - really tender noodles and veg in the sweetest mild curry broth. The portion was huge, but it was so great I didn't leave a drop.", "author": "Poppy C."}

However, the restaurant ambiance is less than comforting, as it is not particularly clean, both inside and outside of the establishment. I have eaten there once, and was a bit concerned about the overall cleanliness, but that hasn't stopped me from ordering takeout time and time again (out of sight, out of mind??).

The pork chop was not the cut of meat I was expecting, and was kind of dry and bland to boot. There wasn't a strong grilled flavor that I've come to associate with this dish. Also the portions were disappointingly small compared to some of what my coworkers ordered at about the same price point.\n\nI wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, but now I know never to get the pork chops with rice dish again.

I was contemplating between ordering either the rice claypot with chicken and shrimp OR the pho bo. I went with the latter and ordered it from my office.\n\n-They told me my order would be done within 10-15 minutes, the typical wait time for a takeout order of pho. Although I gave it time and walked slowly from my office, I still had to wait in the restaurant, which was fine. They accept cash and card as payment, which is perfect considering that some Asian restaurants are cash only.\n\nI didn't know what to expect since I've never ordered takeout pho. I didn't want to pay tips, and I've read previous reviews of sanitary issues. Upon eating the pho from its plastic container, I noticed that the noodles were clumped together, and the ingredients were mainly on the top, inconvenient with the soup ratio. It was delicious, probably because I was craving pho. I would go back in person to eat at Sai's, and probably try the rice claypot with chicken and shrimp.", "author": "Erica K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-13", "description": "I am so glad my colleagues suggested Sai's for lunch! I had never been here and was barely aware of it.\n\nOn my first visit, I decided on the Rice in claypot with shrimp and chicken. The dish hit all the right notes! The jasmine rice was nicely starchy but not overly sticky, while slightly crunchy where it hit the searing hot walls of the claypot thus forming a lovely 'socarrat.' The chicken was a touch seared, the shrimp done just right and juicy, and the sauce with the mushroom and bok choy all topping the bowl of rice was scrumptious! I boxed half my meal as it was a pretty generous portion. \n\nOn my second visit, I decided on the sauteed chicken with three mushrooms. The portion was huge, and came with a generous side of jasmine rice. Again, the sauce they used was delicious and was the perfect foil for the jasmine rice. However, I was a little disappointed with the chicken as it tasted more \"steamed\" than \"sauteed\". Except for curries, I belong to the group that prefer meat to get at least a little bit of sear before it is hit with the sauce. And since the dish was a \"sauteed chicken\" I expected it. The mushrooms however were tasty and cooked just right. The inch-long segments of scallions didn't add to the dish; I wish it were bokchoy or some other leafy greens instead. Again, I took half my meal home; when reheated, it tasted even better as the sauce had seeped into the jasmine rice it was sitting on.\n\nGranted, on both occasions, I could have wolfed it all down but I was sated with just the half, and decided to savour my meal one more time.\n\nThe prices barely crosses over to the '$$' sign. Most are in the very low tens and could have easily wandered off into the '$' range.\n\nWith the price, the portion size, and mostly due to the flavours, I can see myself coming back repeatedly.", "author": "Umesh T."}

The owner yells at him again asking, \"WHY AREN'T YOU CLEANING THE OTHER TABLES?!\" \n\nHe hasn't even finished cleaning one table, and you already want him to move onto another?

It's not one of my usual haunts since I work a good half-hour walk away, but it was a nice change-up from my usual sammie on the run since good Vietnamese restaurants are not a common sight near the demolished Transbay Terminal (except Perilla, of course... http://www.yelp.com/biz/perilla-san-francisco#hrid:ABLmycgZr6dwFtVUfY1JkA.).\n\nWe got a table right at the front door, and it felt like being in the middle of a bowling lane with people aiming their strikes at me to watch my pins drop. Luckily, not many of them were good bowlers. What caught my eye on the menu was the $10 Chicken and Shrimp Claypot (see photo).

I finally said \"are you kidding?!\"  \nThen the man smiled apologetically and said I could just stay at that table.\nI was ready to order but took a while because it is so busy. Then they asked me (told me) that another solo person would share the table. I could care less. \nThe food was not even great. Just mediocre.   My favorite Local Vietnamese restaurant is. MUCH better. \nWhat a disappointment!", "author": "Hannah S."}

They had a crispy bird's nest like batter, sorta like tempura but finer. As always, the vietnamese know how to cook their pork! The sweet sauce complimented the moist, thin vermicelli noodles :) and the based of the dish was laden with fresh vegs like bean sprouts and chopped up lettuce. I wish there was more bean sprouts. \n\nMy friend had the chicken and mango dish with rice. It was ok but I preferred my dish. \n\nWe also shared a side order of fresh spring rolls (shrimp). They were ok. A little stingy on the shrimp but other than that it was all good. \n\nI'll definitely head back to this place again.

I ordered the Beef Pho (#19) to go. First taste: Broth isn't complex whatsoever. It tasted too sweet and was a bit too brown. Not sure what's up with that. Also, it only contained a few measly pieces of steak and meatballs. There were no options for tendon, rare steak, or tripe. The container was PACKED with noodles. I would have preferred more broth, more meat,  and far fewer noodles.  \n\nI guess this place is fine if you're pressed for time and really desperate for pho, but I probably will not return.", "author": "Casey M."}

I'm kind of picky when it comes to my Asian food venues. It also didn't help that Boyfriend mentioned that this place had previously had a rodent problem? I mean, nothing necessarily looked out of place and nothing was overtly dirty -- at least, no more than you would typically expect at such an establishment (I know you know what I'm talking about).\n\nI ordered the pho bo (beef pho), Boyfriend ordered the bo kho (beef stew with noodles) and Boyfriend's mom got a curry fish dish (can't remember/find the name). Our food took forever to come out, which sucks. Granted, they were pretty busy, but nothing that warranted for the curry fish dish to come out first about 15 minutes after we order and THEN the pho and the beef stew didn't come out for another 15 minutes after that. I honestly think the waiter forgot our food hadn't arrived.\n\nTaste-wise, the food is what you expect it to be. I liked my pho fine, but it's no better or worse than the pho I've had in the East Bay. Granted, I think it's fairly difficult to screw up pho, but I could be wrong. The curry fish was really good, too, and I may order that next time instead since it was more flavorful than what I ate.\n\nOverall, it's a solid Vietnamese place near the FiDi. I don't think it's worth the down-the-street line, but if you want to score a table then get here early (I'd recommend 11:30am).", "author": "Anna W."}

I came here craving pho, but that desire rapidly dissipated after I walked into this greenhouse. I suppose if the goal was to emulate a Southeast Asian summer, these folks had it down.\n\nOkay, I exaggerate the heat, slightly. After all, it's summer (/winter) in SF, and 98% of the time AC is beyond irrelevant.\n\nStill, that doesn't change my feelings on the food, which was decidedly mediocre. I ordered the basil chicken, and while the flavouring was fine, the meat didn't seem your most expensive poultry cut. There also wasn't much of it. The bulk of the dish consisted of peppers, onions, and other vegetables that take up space but leave you fishing for more protein. Could be more generous - it's chicken, not caviar!\n\nI also sampled the other entr\u00e9es my table ordered and wasn't blown away by any of them - including the pho. I don't consider myself the ultimate arbitrator on pho authenticity, but this broth failed to conjure the magical feelings I associate with a good bowl of pho. Silver lining: I enjoyed their Vietnamese beer, give it a try?\n\nGiven its location, this place deserves accolades for serving pho and staying open for dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "It wasn't love at first sight, or taste in this case, but Sai's has quickly evolved into a default spot for lunchtime Asian comfort food to combat cold and damp SF afternoons. \n\nI avoided Sai's for a while after my first experience becuase they didn't seperate the noodles from the broth when I order it to go which meant soggy noodles. Meh. But through the persistence of, and devotion to the place by my colleagues, I've come to enjoy some key dishes here. \n\nFirst, every cold day requires the curry chicken/beef-stew noodle soup. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=Mpm8m5_SikWJxUealEaa9w) Alternatively you can switch out noodles for rice. Like all good South East Asian curries, it's a rich coconut milk based curry, not too spicy, just a soul warming meal. While the chicken is more typical, I really like the beef stew - the slow braised meat just falls apart in your mouth. \n\nThe next go-to choice is the chicken and shrimp claypot rice. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=PoY8g3eW4rl_8P9gnc0VUg) It's a nostalgic taste perhaps but the combination of shrimp, chicken, bok choy, and crispy rice covered in hoisin sauce just hits the right spot. The secret we believe has to be salted fish. We know it's in there somewhere for a little more savory oomph. \n\nOther good choices include the imperial rolls, fresh spring rolls withshrimp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=67T22k-DXpOvVJEbRSE6fQ), Vietnamese \"potstickers\", sauteed mixed vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=8q-EaHfZBYDCh2dfbKH4Wg), bun with imperial rolls and pork (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=RYnkkR04S0gpz9mjhxUkYw), beef stew noodle soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=teMiyofONhsHWRdt0xSHMg), and beef pho (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=Is3NxRcak9L95jPWhZwlIg). They're all pretty decent which says alot about the place. There aren't too many dessert options and the eat-and-go lunch crowd rarely orders it but if you must have a sweet treat, the fried bananas and ice cream (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/IaDXv2ZNo2HUeTatlsjMsw?select=cFbF-sCEpvEMO3hvjOp68Q) are decent. \n\nI've slowly grown to like Sai's as a satisfying lunch spot. It gets line-out-the-door crowded during the peak times of noon-1.30pm but here's a tip if you're in a larger group, you can actually call ahead to get a table; just make sure your whole party shows up at said time.", "author": "Jon L."}

I have ordered most of the non seafood items on the list and I have yet to be disappointed. My order is always correct and I always get service with a smile even when things are crazy.\n\nWhen I first went to this place, I was a bit leery because, from the outside it looks like the typical low health score restaurant in the area, but I was wrong. Every day at lunch there is a huge line and every chair was filled! Before ordering I excused myself to go to the bathroom, because unfortunately, as SF foodies know, you can judge the cleanliness of the kitchen by the cleanliness of the bathroom. The bathroom was in a dark corner of the restaurant and surprisingly it was very clean and even had supplies!

It's seriously the best thing I've eaten all year and I've eaten a lot... From small holes in the wall to decadent tasting menus at Michelin-rated restaurants... Still, this dish stands out and I cannot stop thinking about it.\n\nWe came here on a whim on a rainy day. My boyfriend said he used to frequent Sai's when he lived in SF and said their beef curry noodle soup was awesome. It didn't sound appealing to me so I decided to get a regular bowl of pho. Big mistake. I ended up eating more than half of his bowl. The soup had so much depth! It was rich and creamy without tasting greasy or decadent for no reason. Don't get me wrong though... It's definitely decadent.  I also really enjoyed the noodles. They weren't your typical pho noodles, but perfect for this dish cooked al dente (the only way to serve noodles in my humble opinion).\n\nMaybe my opinion is skewed because I wasn't expecting much, but this completely hit me upside the head and has left me craving it non-stop like a crackhead going through withdrawals. I only wish they opened on Sundays or closed later so this South Bay girl could get her fix.\n\nOutside of the beef curry noodle soup, everything else was mediocre. The place is no frills and feels a bit run down. It's basically your average pho joint with decor and service to match. The spring rolls were pricier than typical, but they were good and I'd order them again. \n\nThe next time I have a chance to go back I've already decided that I'm going to get a minimum of two orders of the beef curry soup to-go so I can take them home (without noodles) -- one to freeze and save for my next insatiable craving and another order so I can try to dissect the recipe in an attempt to make it myself.

Perfect for FiDi residents looking for a close and inexpensive dinner option.  This place is truly \"A-OK\"!\n\nImperial Rolls: Funny how the name sounds so regal whereas the reality is simply something deep fried... a style of cooking consumed by folks far from regal in this country!  This is a standard dish at most Vietnamese restaurants, but their preparation pleasantly surprised me.  The rolls were thinner than usual for a higher crunch-to-pork ratio.  Also, some parts were lightly fried and some heavily fried for a nice texture variation.\n\nPan Fried Crispy Crepe w/ Shrimp & Chicken: Not on all Vietnamese menus, B\u00e1nh X\u00e8o is always a welcomed appetizer.  The coconut/turmeric crepe was light and crispy.  The shrimp had been pan fried for good browned edges.  The chicken was ok and they went a tad crazy with the bean sprouts.  So much going on and so yummy.  \n\nBeef Pho: No tripe, no tendon: fine by me!  No flank and no brisket: huh?  A very minimalist soup of thin eye round (mostly cooked and barely any rare sections) and meat balls.  I used to think it odd, but now I miss the pages upon pages of the various beef part combination options for Pho Bo at other restaurants.  Once you get over the one-pho-for-all communism, you can appreciate the tasty broth and ample portions of beef.\n\nLemonade: Why do Vietnamese restaurants always give me limeade when they advertise lemonade?  However, it is quite refreshing and tastier than lemonade (except for meyer lemonade).  Thankfully they don't make the same substitution mistakes serving tofu instead beef, else I'd be saddened by the loss in translation.", "author": "Adam B."}

What's that, you ask?\n\nSai's Curry Beef Stew Noodle Soup is a bowl of curry soup larger than your head (unless, of course, you have one of those water mellon-sized noggins). In the bowl, you'll find curry broth, big pieces of carrots, onions and potatoes, big chunks of yummy fatty beef and rice noodles.\n\nLoad that monstrosity up with as much Sriracha as you can possibly tolerate and you've pretty much got yourself thirty minutes of heaven. That's 20 minutes longer than your boyfriend lasts, so for only $8, I figure that's a pretty sweet deal!\n\n...and if you can manage to shove the entire bowl down your gullet, you're a bigger man than I.

My sister's favorite is the 23 1/2 (don't know why it's called that).  My favorite is 5 spice chicken with the thinly sliced pickled daikon.  I've had their combo plates too but can't eat some of the stuff on there now so just go straight for the meat dishes.  It seems to be very quiet at dinner time during the week so if you go then, you'll immediately get a seat.  I just call in or drop in and take my food out with me.  Staff aren't real friendly but I'm not looking for friendship when I go here.  The food is good and it's near my work and it has my 5-spice chicken which I can't seem to make myself to get it to taste this good.\n\nSept. 2013--ok, I''m addicted.  I LOVE their chicken salad, the mix of vegetables used is delicious and refreshing, not sure if they put a sauce already on it but you do get a small container of that lovely fish sauce (but it doesn't need it, it taste great without).  I like their pho (beef) but it came with spaghetti noodles (that's what they looked and tasted like), I prefer the rice noodles and will ask next time I get pho.  Oh, and I got their bun rien (chef's special), was a little interesting but nothing to write home about--I think I'd prefer (1) rice noodles to compliment the crab balls, (2) having loose crab and not crab \"cake\" balls (they were ok but I want the crab taste more prevalent in the broth).\n\nSummer 2014.  Had me some chicken salad again but got a huge MSG migraine from the food.  Don't know whether this was someone new making it and didn't know that good fresh food doesn't need MSG to taste excellent, of what.  I can't risk getting another MSG migraine so I'll avoid this dish at least.  I eat here when I have to work so I always have to go back to work after food, and having MSG doesn't work real well.  I still think the food is excellent, just kind of disappointed about them adding MSG.", "author": "Kai T."}

But those weren't onions, trust me!  Onions do not have legs...  The server treated it like nothing happened.  He apologized and offered to bring something else.  When I declined, he still charged us for the roach broth!  Glad they didn't charge extra for the roaches.  Later I learned about their very low food inspection score.  One of the worst in the city.  It was even published in a local paper, SF Chronicle, for it's low safety score.  The way people describe it recently makes me feel that things are not improving.

I always liked coming here on cold days, the portions are big and the broth is very flavorful in a subtle way.  The meat tended to be a little fatty but was manageable.\n\nSometimes it takes a little while to get seated, which sucks because you need to stand outside in the cold.

I have to say that I'm not a huge fan of the flavor until i add a small ramekin of hot sauce and mix it in with the soup. Otherwise, it's a bit bland for me. The hot sauce brings out the flavor of the curry and it's not as spicy as Capitol Kim Tar. Both are good in their own ways of course. Sai's curry pho has carrots and tender beef that's marbled with tendon. You get a choice of Beef, Chicken or Lamb. I've heard the beef is the best. \n\nThe only problem is that even though we call ahead for pickup, the whole trip takes 35 minutes. Walking there from work, waiting a bit, and walking back up.

They're Chinese!\n\nThe food:\n\nThere are not many places that make curry pho. A few in the Sunset, a bunch in the Peninsula... Sai's happens to make a mean curry pho and a lamb curry pho at that. I came in with the intentions of ordering a curry pho, but came across the smell of the BBQ pork, so I ordered that instead. My lunch buddy was sweet enough to order the curry pho so I could sneak a bite from her.\n\nBBQ Pork Over Rice - The dish was generally good. Nothing special than any other Vietnamese restaurant. I did wait 20 minutes for my dish and an additional 10 when I sent it back because it was cold.\n\nLamb Curry Pho - Drool, this dish is so good. The broth is soupy, spicy and rich in coconut milk.

My dry cleaning bill resulting from a meal here always exceeds what I had to pay to stuff my face with noodley goodness.  My current love affair is with the curry lamb noodle bowl.  Amazing flavor, and they somehow create a silky, velvety texture out of broth and noodles and lamb.  I think witchcraft may be involved, but I frankly don't care.\n\nMy only complaints are: (1) they use meat with a LOT of bone in it.  This makes it a touch hard to actually eat the meat in the dishes.  I happen to be a megan (eating only meat and meat by-products, the opposite of vegan), so I need to sink my (fake) choppers into some tender flesh in order to walk away satisfied.  However, megan does not equal wolf (it would be easier if Yelp recognized the \"does not equal\" sign, but sadly it doesn't), and I'm not willing to plop a bony and gristley chunk of meat on the paper tablecloth and chew on it.  (2) Unless you like eating lunch at 11:30 or 1:00, it is HARD to find a table here.

But not this place. The broth was just right. There were lots of veggies and the seafood was clean. The shrimp was already peeled (yay!), there were little slices of fish cake, fish balls, slivers of cuttlefish. The bowl itself is quite large, but I don't usually aim to finish all the soup.

I know you're thinking, \"Vietnamese and no Pho, what the hell are you thinking, girl?\"\n\nLet me explain. I don't do hot beverages or anything remotely related - it goes back to when I was a kid and my dentist thought it'd be a great idea to yank all but like 8 of my teeth to prep me for braces, which led to the subsequent instant Lipton soup in my thermos which was either too cold by the time I got to it at lunch time, or too hot when my mom insisted I ask those mean looking lunch ladies for hot water and my soup wouldn't cool before we had to rush to the playground - ah, but I digress and that is one long run-on sentence.\n\n\nHere's what I like about the restaurant:\n\nGREAT VARIETY in the all the dishes they offer. Personally, I like their BUN (or vermicelli) bowls which are tasty and in healthy portions. The other two dishes I can personally vouch for are YELLOW CURRY and the STRING BEAN dishes. Unlike Thai dishes, they inhibit a mild spiciness for those of us who don't like to return to work with terrible heartburn.\n\nIf you have room for desert, the fried banana with ice cream is a good choice. Personally, I like to have it in place of your REGULAR meal. Then again, I'm a dessert fanatic.\n\nAnother GREAT thing about this place is that they accommodate LATER LUNCH HOURS for those of us working a job where we feel happy when our work allows us to take a lunch. \n\n\nThings to know about this restaurant:\n\nThey get PACKED during the usual lunch hour. Go just before or a little after to expect faster service.\n\nBe prepared to get cozy. They seat family style.\n\nYou have to ask for water, but tea is provided automatically.\n\nService is LUKEWARM, at best, but they are quick.", "author": "Carrie S."}

You must buy the 'over rice' and then we can give you soup, they said.  Cool.  We sat down.  Server comes up, I ask him for the order and a pho on the side.  $3 dollars.  THREE DOLLARS.  For a side bowl of soup.  No meat, just broth.  Great.  So unless I get to keep the bowl they served it in, I had to decline it.  For principle's sake.\n\nBad move.\n\nThe chicken came out warm and GRAY.  How do you make chicken turn gray?  And it's not just my order, my buddy had the same problem.  Great.  Ok, so we dive in.

My coworkers order Pho, green beans and beef and the Basil Garlic Chicken.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-11-16", "description": "I wanted to like Sai's, because its extensive \"vegetarian\" menu is the only thing that sets it apart from the equally busy, closer-to-my-work Golden Star.\n\nI am just losing patience for the number of long-established East Asian restaurants in San Francisco who insist on putting \"vegetarian\" sections on their menus when they must know by now that their interpretation of vegetarian does not match that of many of the people who keep them in business. When you do double-check, which I have learned I must do, the wait staff are often dismissive or evasive, which confirms to me that they are aware of this mismatch but perhaps believe that fish sauce is some \"secret weapon\" that makes their vegetarian dishes tastier, and that ignorance is bliss.\n\nI'm vegan, and I went to Sai's for lunch for the first time with a vegetarian friend. I ordered the mixed vegetables with coconut and curry sauce from the vegetarian section of the menu.  When it arrived, it had tofu in it, which threw me off, because obscured by the sauce and veggies, the slightly crumbly strips of tofu looked sort of like meat (and the menu description of the dish did not note bean curd, which most of the vegetarian dishes are described as containing).  Since it did not occur to me that my dish might have tofu, I thought maybe they had brought me someone else's curry, and it was meat, so I just politely checked with the waiter that this was the vegetarian curry.  He sort of scowled at me and said it had oyster sauce in it--and then proceeded to inform me that \"that was why\" he had told my friend that the pho wasn't available vegetarian.  My friend had had the pho before at Sai's without meat (it's not on the menu, you have to ask) and was under the mistaken impression it was vegetarian--when she attempted to order it this time he had told her it was made with either beef or seafood broth. That's fine, she's asking for something which is not on the menu, I didn't expect them to have vegetarian pho broth on hand, though it's unfortunate that someone gave her the impression the dish was vegetarian on a previous visit. \n\nWhat's perplexing to me is that not so much that they use oyster sauce in a dish that is listed under a section of the menu that is marked (not \"vegetables\" mind you) VEGETARIAN, but that the waiter was essentially telling me it was my fault for not realizing that because the pho wasn't available vegetarian, this curry dish was not truly vegetarian also.  \n\nDespite the grumpiness, he told me he would have them re-make it and whisked it away, though I told him he didn't have to (I hate wasting food more than a little oyster sauce).\n\nClearly this waiter has had this sort of experience before, as he seemed unsurprised, like he foresaw that I would reject the dish based on the fish sauce.  Why is it so hard to just correct your menu?  Or train your waitstaff to check with patrons who order off the vegetarian menu if fishy ingredients are okay or not?\n\nI am usually against giving restaurants low ratings because of poor service.  The quality of food at Sai's is good, and the prices are reasonable.  The coconut curry was delicious (yes, even without oyster sauce!).  I wish there was a Vietnamese restaurant in town where vegetarians and meat-eaters could enjoy a meal together, but I guess I'll have to stick to places like Enjoy Vegetarian for my curries and black bean sauce dishes at lunch in the FiDi.", "author": "Tamara F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-12-04", "description": "I wanted Pho for lunch today; is that too much to ask for? Because I'm sick I am hankering for something hot, spicy, liquidy and full of um um goodness (not the Campbell soup kind).   I was on a mission, I rallied a friend and she indulged me.  We head off to Pho in the Embarcadero Center.  It's backed up; we, being impatient people (and I'm starting to believe what they say about those who are patient), decide to take our quest up the street to another Vietnamese restaurant.  She suggested Sai's and persuaded me to give it one more chance.  I felt it necessary to return the same consideration she gave me (with the added \"I don't really like that place, I've always left disappointed with their food, but okay, I'll give it another try\"). \n\nThe place is packed, nonetheless we are seated quickly; my luck is changing (or so I thought).  We are seated at a family style table, no worries, I like the idea of sitting next to two hot techy guys.  We order, my friend & her traditional chicken w/rice & fried veggies.  Me, I order lamb in curry soup with vermicelli noodles, and before the waiter got away, I ask, \"is the meat fatty?\"  The waiter says, \"oh no, just meat...\"  Sounds yummy to me, bring it on.  We wait; my friend is served first I'm served 7 minutes later; no worries. I dig in.  What the BLEEP! Bones, I was served a bowl full of bones!  No worries, the broth is good, I'll sip on this while trying to figure out how consume the rest of the soup in a lady like fashion without choking on all the bones.  I can't, I can't do it.  I have to use my fingers; who cares what the cute techy guys next to me think about my unlady like manners, I need to eat and its just lunch for God sake.\n\nI pick and I pick, but where to put the bones?  I place them back down on the table, where's the harm in that?  Surely, they don't expect me to put the bones back in my soup.  Too many bones to pick through so I give up and start my slurp.  Slurp, slurp, eek, what's this?  Again, in unlady like fashion using my fingertips, I pick out the sharp bone from mouth.  No worries, I'm a trooper, I really wanted this soup...  Slurp, slurp, AUGH!!!  I can't, I can't do it, I can't eat this, it has too many bones and I'm afraid I might swallow a sharp edged one and it will tear away at my tummy.  This shouldn't be a problem; right?  I can easily swap it out for some else on the menu; right?   \n\nHAAAAH!!!!  Evidently not to the manager.\nManager:  You ordered this, that's what you get.  \nMe: Sir, I asked your waiter if the meat was fatty, he said no but did not mention anything about bones.  \nManager:  No, you ordered this, that's what you get.  \nMe:  Yes, sir, I understand that this is what I ordered, I wanted the lamb in curry noodle soup, but your menu does not mention anything about bones, nor does it say \"traditional\".\nManager:  Fine!  That's one way of getting out of paying for your lunch.  (picks up bowl and quickly walks away muttering things under his breath as he goes).\nMy friend:  Wow!  What was that about?\nTechy guys:  Wow, WTF?\nMe:  Hum, I wonder if the manager is going to give me something else without bones.\n\nIn my moment of quandary, the manager quickly walks back over and yells at me... What do you expect when you order lunch, what do you think you're going to get?  Is this a conundrum; I ponder...  I answer, \"what I asked for\".\nManager screaming:  You're just trying to get of paying, you're just trying to get a free lunch!  Walks away, returns quickly, drops the bill on the table and walks away again.\n\nI had no idea what had just occurred, I was not rude, I was not insulting, and if given the opportunity, I would have been amenable in ordering an alternate soup.  Heck anything aside from bones as I really wanted Pho.  \n\nManager comes back to point out that he removed the charge from the bill and added he was aware our trying to get a free meal.   \n\nMy friend:  This guy is Unbelievable!  You're being so nice and he's being such an as_hole!  You're not even arguing with him.  What is his problem?\nMe:  Don't worry about it, it's not that big of a deal.  The guy is obviously stressed and it's likely I am not the first to have complained about the soup.  Besides, I will NEVER return to this establishment, it's that simple.   And added, \"have you ever heard of YELP?\"  ;o)\n\nIts 2:40; I believe I'll give my one of my favorite Pho places a call for some take-out....

After 2 months straight of ordering pho ga with white meat only, they reverted back to the good stuff.  Phew.

The price is reasonable for downtown location, not perfect but it tastes good and the portion is good enough for me.

When you're in for the spicy meat thing go for one of the combos. But if you're ready to be warmed inside and out, it's the chicken curry, best as a soup but can also be had as a stew too. It's just astonishingly great. I remember coming in once on a cold cold day and ordering the chicken curry soup. Was seated across from another guy (yes it's that crowded) who had already ordered. Minutes later, when it arrived, we discovered we'd both ordered the same thing, and agreed there was nothing like it downtown. Deep, not-powdery in any way, perfectly spiced. A huge bowl. Take home the extra. \n\nWhen I'm in a healthy mode i've done the asparagus or beans with shrimp, which is excellent. You can ask them to make it spicier -- they're very accommodating. Most of the wait staff is all business, but Henry the owner or manager is a sweetheart. \n\nOh, and if you ask you can get their \"red rice,\" which some of the staff call \"brown rice.\" Much better, but I think they charge you a little extra.", "author": "James N."}

I agree with some of the other reviewers who mentioned that their bowl of pho  tasted like dish soap.  I've had that happen to me too a couple of times.  I like their rice combinations for a lighter, but filling meal.  I took my roommate here for the first time a couple of weeks ago and she liked that when we ordered the pho and the rice combination to share, they brought out extra bowls and plates for us.  Even though the food is a bland version of real Vietnamese food, they have the basic flavors down and it fulfills my needs temporarily.  My biggest gripe about the place: I hate smelling like the places after I get out.  Oh, and it's recommended to come here 20 minutes before twelve at lunch time.
