The ginger peach tea wasn't good at all. No flavor, bland, tastes like green tea. My family and I came here on two occasions. The second time we came back because the food was good for a small cafe. \nFirst time I came, I ordered the turkey pesto on croissant, which typically comes with the French roll. I opted out because the roll itself was huge. The croissant wasn't greasy. Although I would say, I first asked for the Asiago cheese bagel with it and changed my mind a few seconds later. The owner, I believe, was adamant about me using the bagel because they already warmed it up and was asking anyone else with me if they wanted it. I found that very inconvenient. I get it's a small business, I own one too, however I believe in customer satisfaction. I'm assuming her son, the other person working there, said it's fine after he witnessed his mom saying that. \nBack to the food. I got jalape\u00f1o cream cheese added in as well as the pesto, and it was delicious. I like that she let us try it. Tasted quite fresh. My sister in law got it on the French roll (as it comes) and said it was good as well. Service is kind of slow since there's only one person making the food.\n\nThe second time we came back, we all ordered one by one. Sissy in law got a drink, vitamin water. After we paid for everything and sat down, I saw as my sissy in law is drinking her drink, asked her why the cap was orange. She then said it tasted funny. Turns out it expired back in October. Without making a big deal, she let one of the workers know, then grabbed another drink and proceeded to drink it. He stopped her and said the price is different and needs to pay more. Not once he apologized for it being expired, instead asked for money. I was kind of upset. I mean wouldn't you want to comp the customer because you had an expired drink from months back? That's a fine from the health department. What if she fell sick? Okay I might be exaggerating, but still. \nIn the end they forgot about my twin's sandwich, he ended up getting it to-go as we were on the way to the airport. \nAll in all, food is good but service is eh', and make sure to double check the expiration dates!!", "author": "Farah A."}

Coffee came out first - it was awful. I don't even know how to describe it, like old coffee mixed with a hint of chocolate? It almost didn't taste like coffee. I threw it away after a few sips. Smoothie came next, and it was super duper sweet. It was supposed to be a banana strawberry mango smoothie, and it tasted fake and full of sugar. We asked the woman behind the counter and she said it was because they put syrup on it. She was super nice and asked us if we wanted it to be remade - we hesitated then said yes, but asked for it without syrup. Then the woman explained that the syrup they use is the syrup of the fruit basically strawberry syrup and mango syrup - to substitute using real fruit- so she wouldn't be able to make it any less sweet. We learned that the strawberry and mango were the fruits they used sweetener for, and the banana was not, so we agreed to a new shake. She remade us a spinach avo banana smoothie - but with the banana sweetener taste. (?!?!) not sure what the miscommunication was there, but the new smoothie still wasn't great.\n\nThe breakfast sandos were good, a tad salty but expected with cheddar and ham.

Also helping this were the cases upon cases of yummy pastries and the smiles I received from behind the counter.  \n\nI ordered an iced ginger chai latte from a small handful of available chais, noting through the very variety that I had found the right place.  Ginger chai?  Who does that?  Not Starbucks, that's for sure.  I was further tickled when I was asked if I wanted my ice crushed or cubed, and then kindly directed to the nearest ATM when I realized the place was cash only.\n\nUpon my return, my drink was ready and I was assured by the awesome barista that I had chosen the best one.  There wasn't really a doubt in my mind, but it was good to have her confirm my suspicions.  I thanked her, and went out to the front of the building, sipping my drink at an outdoor table and soaking in the surprisingly-decent weather.  I had chosen crushed ice, by the way, so it was a veritable chai and ginger smoothie.

Small, so no people watching. The drinks come in paper disposable cups, although there are photos of pretty real cupped drinks on the wall. There were a couple other people there, and they all had paper cups too. This is cash only, but luckily I had cash. My chai was probably good..I wanted to like it. For some reason I didn't. It was too hot, which seems silly since it's supposed to be hot, but it couldn't cool down and my tongue is still burned 3 days later. I could taste that the spices were fresh - a lot of ginger, but somehow the ginger overshadowed the chocolate too much. That's just my opinion though. Any place that makes their own fresh chai is great. La Boulange would probably be more my speed, I can spend a while in there sipping my chai latte from a bowl and reading a book and watching others, so I just had unjust expectations. I left early and threw out the drink because I could only drink less than a quarter.

We came in with two pretty typical thermoses (one 8 oz, one 16 oz), and were overcharged for both (I was charged 16 oz for the 8 oz one!!).  When I realized it and asked for a refund of the difference, the cashier (the owner, I think) was quite rude about it.  She actually poured my drink into a 20 oz paper cup and then tried to convince me it was full, even though it was a couple of inches from the top of the cup!  Sheesh!  I've never had problems using my thermoses at other coffee shops.  Probably won't go back.", "author": "Kathleen V."}

The other thing would be a simple egg and cheese on a bagel in the morning. Now, allowing for the fact that they don't have New York bagels here, their egg and cheese bagel sandwiches almost remind me of New York. So, on a beautiful Sunday morning, grab a bagel, a cup of coffee and head out to the park.", "author": "Michael S."}

Mind you,  I swore off coffee for years because its acidic nature tore a birthing canal in my stomach.  Then while in Tahoe last week, a friend offered me a cup of joe and I began to reacquaint myself with the dark cousin from Sumatra.   I order an au lait from the barista: nice guy.  Fairly handsome if I remember correctly - well I'll put it this way he wasn't ugly and I wouldn't kick him put of bed.  I asked for their milk selection and settled on soy.  As he made my mid - afternoon snack I saw the bounty of pastries before me and asked if any of the items, a fat free apricot oat  thing (you know the circular kind that are usually wheat free) and a fruit granola pie looking confection particularly, were wheat -free (a boy's gotta watch his wheat and gluten intake).  Sadly the barista said he wasn't sure.  But then he suggested a bran muffin aka a wheat field wrapped in plastic wrap as an alternative because \"it's the most popular.\"  Well buddy, if I was looking for popular pastries I would have went to The 'Buck and started my evening right with a skinny latte and a lemon bar.  Disappointed and shot down I took my au lait (yes they charge extra for soy milk like all the Nazis) and made my way to the condiment bar.  Splenda, sugar, sugar in the raw, and the blue packets whose name escapes me.  No spoons for stirring (I guess that whole recycle, reduce, reuse movement missed this block of upper haight).  However, they did have a homemade sign  (circa 2nd grade) on their napkin dispenser advising patrons to use no more than that which they need.  Even with chocolate and splenda en lieu of honey, the au lait made my taste buds go au no.", "author": "Eric J."}

Lava Java has the best breakfast bagel I've found anywhere.  I'm actually sad on days that don't start with an egg and cheddar on asiago bagel sandwich.  Sometimes I get it for dinner, it's that good.  Pair that with their chocolate macadamia nut coffee and it's a good day.  The staff is super friendly and will quickly learn your name and usual order if you become an obsessed regular like me.  Just be sure to bring cash, because they don't take cards.", "author": "Laura M."}
