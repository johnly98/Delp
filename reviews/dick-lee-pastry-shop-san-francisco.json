And if you had all the time in the world, it probably would be financially a good deal, just not a very delicious one.\n\nThe reason for that is that it takes them forever to bring out food. I guess they make it fresh, which is nice and cool, but so you do need to realize that when you are initially ordering food, you should probably order everything you want, because by the time the second round comes you've had already stayed there so long that you just to leave.\n\nEven though the food was \"freshly\" prepared, it wasn't all that good and left a lot to be desired. The cleanliness is a bit questionable in my eyes too, some of the sauce dishes looked quite a bit dirty.\n\nOverall, if you just want to save money and have all the time in the world, sure this place fits the bill. But there are so many places in San Francisco that you can enjoy a much nicer meal and not feel shitty afterwards.", "author": "Tyler T."}

Charge $.10 extra for the tax , so technically $1.10 total.\n\nCons: all orders are made fresh to order so it took over 25+ minutes for 5 small Bao's which I asked for to go. We ended up having to sit down inside of the restaurant to wait, not like other places where you can take it to go immediately. The BBQ pork buns are mostly bread (bread is also kind of dry, slightly more crumbly than I like it) , they're not incredibly flavorful (I found the pork sort of bland). Unfortunately it seems like it's a one man show being run at this place, which is why service is a bit slow.

My general knowledge to what dim sum is that it's generally filled with pork-- which is what my partner and I don't like. So we made this face with our tongue out and kept walking up the block. We were looking for pastries to bring home and we saw a stand in front of Dick Lee's. We didn't realize it was a part of the same company and we're lured by the wrapped sweet rice and taro buns. I tried to explain to my foreign partner what the pastries were and the owner seemed nice. \n\nWe were sat down, charged an extra 50cents when we weren't asked if we wanted it for a dine-in or to-go. The wrapped rice came with honey and sugar. My mom used to make these so I was a bit excited. My partner didn't like it and it was a bit on the super plain side. I don't know how to exactly describe it but it was fairly burned and needed a lot of sugar. We sadly ate it and finished what we could to show some respect that we had food on our plate.\n\nTaro buns were better than the wrapped sweet rice by miles. I can't compare it to any other bakeries in town because we lost our appetite and fell short on money. The food was pretty expensive for one item each, I wonder if we should've opted for the 5.99 ayce. Owner and service was nice at least.. \n\nI recommend giving this place your own try, but if you're looking to spend your money for something cheap and worth it... continue to walk up the hill to another bakery to get your money's worth.", "author": "Liza H."}

You have to fully take in the decor. My favorite piece is the windows computer from cave men times! It's like a cherry on top!

When I couldn't stomach the food any longer, I asked for a to-go box and received styrofoam-- which is ILLEGAL in San Francisco, since you can't recycle or compost it.\n\nThe thing that really made me angry enough to write this review, however, was the fact that the man tried to cheat us. He initially charged us $42.50. When we did the calculations ourselves, it came out to $32.50. When he redid his calculations, surprise, surprise, he got the same number. But of course, he rounded up to $33.\n\nPlease, please, save your money and do not go here. The food is terrible, the place is unhygienic, and you will be overcharged on your bill if you don't double check.", "author": "Mercedes T."}

For that he gets five stars. \n\nThe all you can eat dim sum or ALL YOU CAN NOT EAT dim sum for $5.99? Not good at all. Bland. The siumai needs more structure. It looked like its about to fall apart while just staring at it. Extra $1+ for hot tea. The fried rice? Sigh. Needs more sodium! \n\nWe accidentally ended up walking inside his place because Delicous Dim Sum next door closed early at 7pm. Gah! If we just walked further down there was plenty of other 4-5 stars dim sum heaven. \n\nOn the other hand. It was such a blast. We tried to actually decipher his style of business and we finally ate. We sat there with two kinds of music blaring. Chinese near where Mr Lee was and hip hop where we're eating. \n\nBad food but really great service, but foodies go where good food is.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-11-27", "description": "I've given my fair share of one star Yelp reviews and I've never felt bad about them (often quite angered, actually). In this case, I feel bad because the owner (Dick Lee?) seems really nice. Yet, he's gotta know that his food is extremely disgusting, right?! So he's doing this on purpose? Luring people in with all you can eat at a cheap price, knowing no one would ever ask for seconds or go back?\n\nI've walked by this place several times and was always enticed by the all you can eat for $5.99 sign. The pictures looked good and authentic. I finally had the displeasure of eating here today. It did take a while to get the food, so I was reading this place's Yelp review and thinking to myself, \"How bad can it be?\" \n\nJust a quick side note: I've bought egg tarts from this place before, to-go, the ones in the display window. And while they were extremely bland, they weren't by any means disgusting. And also as background, I'm Chinese, I've had dim sum all over the Bay Area and in Hong Kong. \n\nSo back to my all you can eat: He charged me $8 per person because it was dinner. Fine, an extra $2; no big deal. We did have to wait a while for the food, but that's fine as well, since the sign said everything was made fresh. He also served it to us (brought all the dishes to our table).\n\nWhen all the food finally came, it was the most unappealing, most disgusting, barely edible, worst dim sum I've ever had! This is NOT an exaggeration at all. (1) The fried rice was essentially old rice, corn, lettuce pieces, and salt. This was not a deal-breaker, since I've had similar caliber of fried rice elsewhere in Chinatown. (2) The shrimp dumplings were shaped like little pieces of candy and looked / tasted nothing like shrimp dumplings at dim sum places. They're not even shrimp! They're more like a tiny, elongated fish balls. (3) The pork buns were mostly bun with little shreds of dried pork; all you can taste is the bun. (4) The pork dumplings were purple colored meat! (5) We were served these complimentary yellow-colored cookies, which he said was made out of flour, eggs, and sugar. We had one bite and they were so bitter / horrible tasting; they tasted like they were made of chemicals. \n\nLike other reviewers have mentioned, I am also shocked at how terrible food tastes here. It's amazing / comical that in this day and age in America, a restaurant can make food this bad. It takes real effort to make food so horrific-tasting. \n\nI've never had food taste so bad that it's not edible (at least not in the US). We discreetly threw away a good portion of our food, obviously didn't ask for seconds. It is no wonder that for such a cheap all you can eat, there are no other diners inside the restaurant. I wouldn't come back if it was free! I think he's banking on people paying the $6 or $8, serve them tiny portions of disgusting food knowing they'd not ask for seconds, and make their money on luring in suckers for a one-time deal. Paying even $6 on the crap they call food is still a huge profit margin for them. I bet this is how they're staying in business.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

We weren't able to find a place that was opened except for the insanely large and obstructive signage here at Dick Lee Pastry Shop. I'll give it to them that they know how to get your attention. Their signage was very akin to the online pop-ups where it says \"Congratulations, we have a winner!\". Yeah, no winner. We figured... maybe it can't be that bad since it's in Chinatown amongst the other dim sum places. So we walked in... and it looked like if Subway merged with a street taco place and broke all the food safety regulations. The trays that they used to cook the dim sum were super dirty and all over the place, and even their cash register was just opened up and money was sprawled everywhere without any order. \n\nService:\nSo we came here because the sign outside promoted $6 all-you-can-eat dim sum, which is super attractive when it's in Chinatown. The sign itself looked super beat up like it went through a few tornadoes. When we were seated, the server (is he the owner?) told us we had to go to the front cashier to order. If that's the case, why didn't he take our order to begin with? So we went to the front and placed in our order with the all-you-can-eat menu. He stated that we can order as much as we want. After we finished ordering, he rang us up for more than $40 which made absolutely no sense! We pointed it out and he said that he didn't know we wanted to do the all-you-can-eat. So he fixed it and gave us our number and had us sit and wait after we paid. We waited for a good 40 minutes, and we had to be somewhere so we went back up and asked for a refund since he didn't even start on our order yet. He stated that they don't do refunds, but he will pack our food to-go. We were at the register and waiting for him to get our food to-go, but he ended up going away to serve 3 or 4 other tables. We had to call out and remind him again that he still owed us our food and emphasize we had to leave. He said okay and he continued to run around in the back doing who knows what (but clearly not getting our food). We ended up leaving without our food because it wasn't worth the possibility of contracting food poisoning or some food-borne disease that we potentially could have gotten due to how filthy the kitchen was.\n\nFood:\nN/A\n\nOverall: I wish I could give a 0/5, but Yelp forces me to put at least 1 star.

They may be fake , or people who have never had good Dim Sum before. Here is our story. I wanted to show a little bit of San Francisco to my wife, who has only been in the USA for 11 months, what it is like in Chinatown San Francisco. Well I was not so hungry, but my wife saw a sign that says All You Can Eat for $5.99. At first, I thought, hmmm, maybe should stay away, but then I said , lets see. Well, I should have seen these posts on Yelp first, but I was a bit tired, and not thinking to well. Anyway we come in, and only one couple was there at first. We sat down, and about 20 people came out of nowhere. The waiter ,and owner showed us a menu, and we asked about the $5.99 All You Can Eat sign, and he said because it is a holiday (Labor Day), the price is $7.99. We almost left(and should of), but we had to use the restroom. Anyway, we wait, and wait, and our asked to write down what we would like. So I write down Egg Rolls, Pork Sui Mia, Seafood Sui Mui, and Shark Fin Dim Sum. We asked for 2 bottles of water $2 each, and Coke Zero. He came back with the water bottles, and Diet Pepsi. As he walked away, I politely said excuse me, but I ordered Coke Zero, and went away and came back with Diet Coke(all well I tried). They guy looks overwhelmed as new customers poor in, and I can understand the pressure, but not how he reacted. His wife seems to work with him. We received the egg rolls first. They were cold almost as ICE. I said they were cold, and brought back ones that seemed to come from a microwave. Anyway , they were not so good. And they guy helps customers that came long after us, with them getting their food first. OK, I get it, this guy is a one man operation. We finally get something that looks like Pork Sui Mai. As we are eating , my wife and I look at each other, like what the hell is this look. Instantly my belly starts aching. Then guy brings us Pork Buns, which we did not order. They were mostly bun, but no too bad. Then what looks another portion of Pork Sui Mai comes, (not the Seafood Sui Mai we were expecting). It tasted exactly the same. Yuck. I get the bill on an Ipad with my VISA. I see $26.00 , which I didn't think to much of at the time, but then as I was leaving, I thought wait a minute, two All You Can Eat, times 2 $15.98, two waters $4.00, and one Diet Coke??? , I don't understand, a $6 dollar coke, or tax of some kind. Bill didn't show tax. And I hit the 15% TIP icon. Well I didn't receive a receipt. Until I looked at my email. Somehow $3.90 tip changed to $6.5. We left without even finishing our meal. You know the old saying, if it seem to be too good to true, stay away. Stay far far far away from this place. I know it is hard to have a business going, but this is not that way.

That was the most worst mistake ever in the history of my lunch hour. I came for their $5.99 dim sum special for all you can eat. I was so surprised that you can eat unlimited dim sum for $5.99; So I decided to come in and give it a try. I walked in and before I could even sit down, the person in the front counter said \"Pay money before sit\". I was so surprised and mad at the same time. I paid my 6$, sat down, grabbed the plate he gave me and started grabbing dim sum. I got pork siu mai, hargow, fried rice, and fortune cookies. The siu mai meat tastes sour and bitter. MEAT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO TASTE SOUR! The hargow was hard as a rock with small, WAIT. VERY SMALL chunks of shrimp. The fried rice was also cold and hard with a lot of oil buried deep into the rice. The fourtune cookie though was pretty good. I ate 10. Hey. I did not come here to eat 10 fortune cookies for lunch. After 20 minutes of eating, my stomach started to hurt very badly. I rushed to the restroom, sat down and had diarrhea. Guess what's the best part? There wasn't any paper for me to wipe my butt. How nice. I had to use my own tissues to wipe my butt after having a stomach ache for the food I paid $5.99 for. So let me see.. I paid $5.99 to poop out their food and lost 1 whole hour of my lunch time.

The BBQ duck was nothing but bones and a sad scoop of rice, it costed $7.99.  The bbq duck felt like scraps and we wouldn't be surprised that they served us food from garbage other people threw out.  The food is NOTHING like the photos displayed in the store front.  The sanitation is questionable.  The tea that came out of the pot had colorful soap bubbles that we did not dare to drink.  On the ground near the self serve water/tea/hot water are two large piles of dirty dishes that customers would place after they finished eating.  \n\nAs we started to question everything about this business, we started calculating the cost of our food.  We first paid  3x $5.99 buffet and he over charged us exactly by $1 (instead of $19.50, he charged us $20.50), he first denied and said $20.50 was correct, but we broke it down with tax and it was obvious we are right.  It's unbelievable as owner he would not know by heart the cost of $5.99 for 3 people with tax is.

YELP PLACES BEFORE YOU EAT, PEOPLE.\n\nMy friends and I were walking around Chinatown during the evening, primarily looking for a cute little bakery that was still open to buy cute little Asian baked goods. The word \"Pastry\" on the banner caught our eyes, so we meandered over to check it out. We were checking out the display case out front (lo and behold, NOT a bakery), when we made our gravest mistake: we were lured into the shop by the nice lady and the sign \"All you can eat dim sum, $5.99 + tax.\" Sounds like a good deal, right? The nice lady caught us in her net, and thus we were forced to oblige to some dim sum (darn our Asian manners).\n\nOh dear. Where to start:\n- The egg tart was a mystery green color instead of the usual yellow. What...? The adventurous ones in the group tasted it and couldn't figure out what it was. Yikes.\n- The outside of the har gow was tough and plastic-y, as if it had been sitting there in the steamer for quite awhile (it probably was). Same issue with the BBQ pork bun.\n-  The meat in the siu mai was still pink (eek). One of my friends pointed out the pile of ground pork being mixed near the door - this meat was also an unusually pink color, so we decided that they probably put food coloring in the meat, so the meat in the siu mai was probably cooked thoroughly (at least that's what we told ourselves).\n\nFortunately for us, we received some exceptional service since our one Cantonese friend was able to speak to the Cantonese owners. The nice lady saw that they were low on fried rice and cooked up a whole new batch just for us, and personally brought out a plate of the fried rice to our table. Unfortunately for us, this meant we had to finish the whole thing (darn our Asian manners again!). It was decent fried rice, though.\n\nConclusion: not a bakery, and not a good place for dim sum.", "author": "Caroline N."}

The price says $5.99 but he charges $7 per person and he said because of tax. How could it be tax? The service was super lousy, the Chinese guy was so bad. Doesn't know any manners and so rude to customers. I will not recommend this place and I hope someone from the state will come and check this place if they are really reporting the sales tax, and if they're kitchen is clean. This place needs closed .... please calling all authorities please come to this place and audit so it can get closed. They served us seafood dumpling and it tasted like it's been cooked for a week, so tough and overcooked. I hated this place that I felt I wasted my money for 2 pcs of sharks fun that tasted like a rotten meat. Please begging authorities to please check this place and get it closed for people's sake.", "author": "Carol B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-03-08", "description": "As you may have noticed the Yelp site was experiencing technical difficulties yesterday. So for about two hours, I wandered around Chinatown without my favorite city guide. \n\nIt was overwhelming! I didn't know where to go, and all I wanted to do was just to stuff my mouth with some sweet, sweet dumplings. \n\nI observed an old Chinese lady steaming big baskets of dumplings outside of her restaurant and paused for a minute to take it all in. Before I knew it, she had guided me in with the crook of her elbow, sat me down, and recommended a few dishes to try. I was a bit tired, super hungry, and raised not to object my elders so I sat down without a complaint. \n\nThe specials she offered were dirt cheap. Think beef and broccoli with fried rice, an egg roll, and wonton soup for $5.75 or a beef curry bowl over hand pulled noodles for $4.75. And a dim sum plate for $1.50. What a steal! \n\nWhen the food came out, I immediately lost my appetite. The soup came out in the crustiest bowl known to man. The silverware seemed dirty as well, as if it was just rescued by the Boxcar children in the town dump. I tried not to be uppity about the situation....I've dined in third world countries before and had some of the best food of my life out of old, crusty bowls. But this definitely was not the case here. The dim sum that came out was hard, crusty and falling a part. I was able to eat one dumpling and two bites of the curry bowl before I gave up. This place was straight up nasty and the super sticky soy sauce bottle didn't help either. I know I have already used the adjective \"crusty\" about a bazillion times in this review already but that's the best way to describe this joint.  \n\nThe one redeeming quality about the restaurant was how genuinely happy the man and woman who owned the shop were to have us eating in their restaurant. I saw a sign that said \"No refunds after ordering\" which I thought was funny at the beginning of my trip but totally made sense by the end.\n\nOnce Yelp started working again a few hours later, I checked to see if my experience was typical for this restaurant only to find out that this restaurant was recently sued by the City of San Francisco for forcing their immigrant workers to work 14 hour days for WAAAAYYYY less than minimum wage. No wonder they were so happy to have some business! \n\nStay far, far away from this place!", "author": "Kimberly S."}

I'm a San Franciscan & eat out quite often and in neighborhoods all over the city.\n\nWas walking around Chinatown & saw the \"All you can eat\" sign.  Thought, why not?  Had dim sum across the street the day before and it was delicious.  So decided to try this place for kicks.  Biggest mistake ever.  If I could rate this a negative five I would.  I think the positive reviews must be posted by folks who don't know good Chinese food.  There was a very long wait time.  I asked for tap water & he immediately grabbed bottled water & rang up the bill.  Fortunately the water was a life saver.  \n\nAfter a 45 minute wait he motioned to us & told us the dim sum was ready in the steamers.  He then quickly turned around & faced the TV.   As others stated food looked nothing like the menu he showed us.  \n\nWe served ourselves the various dim sum.  No napkins.  He has toilet paper rolls for napkins.   So we went back to our table.  Took a bite out of one, then spit it out.  All the dim sum appeared undercooked & possibly made from spam.  Even though the dim sum was large, it was disgusting; a greasy meaty mess.  I spit out every dim sum I tried.  I threw away all pieces in the trash close to the table.  Perhaps that's why it's there so conveniently?\n\nI figured I might as well try the pork bun.  How bad could it be?  Horrible!  Weird tasting dough & a tiny speck of meat inside.  Spit that out too & threw away in trash.\n\nIt is \"All you can eat\" because ALL you can eat is one bite before you spit it out.  \n\nIf you can call this food, it is bad quality food and tastes horrible.  It is deceptive that he shows you stock photography of dim sum, but serves something else.  He is nice to the prospective customer until you pay, then not so nice after one pays.\n\nI agree with the other posts.  Stay away from this place unless you like bad food, a long wait & don't care if you get sick.  This place should be shut down.  Someone does need to call the Health Department indeed.", "author": "Zela N."}

They were tolerable, definitely not the best Egg Tart I've ever had and the crust was starting to disintegrate into my hand the more bites I took into it. The custard was a bit too eggy for my liking, but what can you do?\n\nI took one look inside the restaurant and it was a no go.

Was actually enjoyable when my friends and I went there a few days ago while visiting San Francisco. What do people expect for paying only $5.99? The reason why I beleive the reviews are bad is because San Francisco has a high standard on dimsum food, since there are so many in the area. If you came to visit, it's not that bad. Just like how buffet food is compared to authentic restaurant food, the same applies here. Some of the food there does look a little suspect, but hey the sui mai and the pork buns were on point. \n\n4/5 for the food.

I Should have known it was bad because it was peak lunch hour, and no one was inside. First off, the dim sum buffet is $7 even, and it's pretty bad: \n\nThe \"shrimp\" dumpling had no noticeable shrimp inside. Instead, there was some mushy yellow filling. I tried to ignore the look and focus on the taste to give it a fair shot. Still not good! The Sui Mai also tasted bad, and was undercooked. I mean it was completely pink inside, though my friend suggested it could have been food coloring... \n\nThe best part about my meal was the complementary water with lemon flavor. That was it.

They now make everything to order, instead of en masse. This may cause a delay in getting your all-you-can-eat dim sum, but is now comes out hot.\nThe ayce menu is limited to about 8 items or so. It does not include all of the dim sum available. Some of it is tasty, some of it is not. The shrimp har gow is a pass. I think they are using small dried shrimp instead of fresh and the taste is quite strong and fishy. The fill in the har gow is almost nonexistent.\nThe dining experience here is a bit bazar. To keep their cost low, about $9 for ayce, you must buss your own table, pick up your food a few dishes at a time and get your chop sticks from a bucket.\nThe owner is affable and friendly, but if you are into clean and tidy, this is not the restaurant for you. Most health department designations go from \"A\" to \"D\". if there were an \"F\", it would be here. The benches you sit on are clean enough, but that's about it.\nTo make sure the food is hot, the owner gives you just a few dishes at a time. You finish what you have, give him back the dirty dishes and he returns a few more of what you have ordered to you. Service=none. You do it all yourself.\nIs there value here?

The eggroll was mushy.. looked crispy on the outside and to some degree it was but after the first bite- a pile of mush!! The wonton soup is a must pass..

The first indication that we were in for a bit of a adventure was the disposable plates and cups that we were handed.  We gwai-los definitely didn't  rate as important enough for the melamine plates that we saw in the hands of other patrons. The food itself was passable but definitely far from gourmet. You absolutely get what you pay for.\n\nThe Good:\nI recommend the diced chicken and tofu with salted fish. It was by far the best thing I had from the whole buffet.  The pork siu mai, sweet and sour meatballs, char siu (BBQ pork) weren't half bad as well.\n\nThe Bad :\nMush (or the lack thereof)  seemed to a big factor in the quality food here. Its works in some things but not in others. The egg custard tart was a good example of if not working. the crust was okay but the custard part was mushy and didn't have the chew of a good custard tart. The Taro Wrapped Sticky Rice also had a lot of the mush factor.  It looked good enough  as I unwrapped it but the rice kernels were all one big ball of mush as I took a bite. One bite and no bueno.\n\nThe Weird:\nTheir chicken \"leg\" was weird. It was actually a bunch of different ground meats that were formed onto a \"leg bone\", coated in an unnaturally yellow batter and deep fried. There was actually a sign that warned me of the amalgam of meats inside but I misread it and assumed it was referring to something else on the line.  The mix was actually okay once I knew what it was but that first bite expecting chicken and getting something completely different threw me for a loop.\n\nAll in all, most of what I ate was satisfactory and the low price was definitely a good thing. I think if I had to pay much more for this buffet I would have definitely rated it lower.", "author": "Sherman B."}

After all, it seemed like great food for a great price. \n\nI went to Chinatown with my friends a couple of weeks ago.

It is like they didn't even try to clean up after you. Well that's because they don't. The food looked and smelled like low quality dump you'd find in the dumpster of a third world country. Unable to stomach the idea of eating the buffet, I chose a smaller 3 dollar combo meal. I got a spoon of fried rice one SMALL pork shumai, a TINY beef dumpling, and a cookie. The rice had no flavor. The meat products had the suspicious taste of rot. The cookie was alright.\n\nObservations I saw:\n\n*I went to the bathroom they had. You can say it had \"chitty maintance\". If the food didn't make you throw up, the restroom will.\n\n*Three girls who needed to go to the bathroom walked in. After realizing they had to make a purchase, they saw the food options. In disgust, they left.\n\n*My friends weren't brave like me. They didn't order anything.\n\n*Lots of flies.  \n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone. I don't even know how this place passed health inspections. If there was any redeeming feature of this restaurant, the girl at the cashier was a sweetheart.

I don't know the go-to Chinatown dim sum spots at all, since this isn't my hood, and I don't find myself here often.  And I don't think Yelp is especially helpful when it comes to hole-in-the-wall dim sum eats and treats because I feel like the community in the CT ain't gonna be Yelpin', amirite? iamrite.\n\nAnyway, we're walking around, randomly, and we see a ginormous All-You-Can-Eat-Dim Sum for $5.99 sign.  For some reason, we were especially attracted to the sign, like innocent, naive little flies drawn to. . .poo.  Sorry for that very unflattering description, but the food really was shitty.  \n\nBecause for $5.99 you get some dim sum staples like shrimp and pork dumplings, BBQ pork buns, and then a buffet line of greasy Panda Express-ish foods.  The shrimp dumplings were passable, but the pork dumplings were just plain weird and not good.  Everything else was really meh and sometimes eew.  Not tasty.\n\nBut I mean, it wasn't like I wanted to throw up after the meal; at least it was edible, which is why this didn't get one star.  \n\nAlso, for those of you who think $5.99 is cheap, it really isn't THAT cheap.  Let me break it down for you.  A typical dim sum meal, shared among a group of 4 or 5 should cost you around $30 - $40.  That's about 6-9 steamers of food (Been eating this stuff since I was like 3 years old. I know my dim sum = don't question the math.), so if you split among a group that size, you should reasonably be paying about $7-$10 per person.  Let's say you order a little less food so that everyone is about 75% full instead of full-on-beach-yourself-like-a-whale-full.  If we're at that end of the spectrum, then you see that $5.99 is really not that cheap at all.\n\nSo, yes.  Do yourself a favor and go somewhere, ANYWHERE else for dim sum.  Sorry I can't give recommendations for Chinatown.  I think there's this sit-down, banquet style place called New Asia for dim sum, and they were decent the last time I went, but I don't remember much else about it.  \n\nBut definitely hit me up if you want recommendations in the Richmond District.

They had everything already in steamers except for the ha gao, definitely a must have dim sum staple.  They told us to wait 20 mins since we had ordered a lot of them , kind of strange since I know it doesn't really take that long to steam them. It ended up being roughly 25-30 mins but I was glad they were fresh.  We both tried one and well, it was.....fishy. Not good.  I remember trying them before but being better....

But you are better off buying what you wish to go as their prices are low, you get a better value buying what you want to go.  But of course you may go for the buffet, you will only get full before you get as good a  value.  People would line up to buy their food products, the place was busy.  Take a seat at a table and circle the items on the menu and it will be brought to you, that was before when I visited them when they were located at 777 Jackson St.\n\nNow, you pay upfront, select whatever you see available and appeals to you.  Unfortunately, the quality has gone down, way down.  Now when I visited, I see rows of empty tables with only a few customers.  Hot tea is included, they charge for bottled water, restrooms for customers only, else it's USD 1 charge to use it.  You won't go away hungry if you're willing to eat their food.  It's not very good, and not satisfying.  I'd rather pay more for better quality food else where.", "author": "George L."}

To be honest, I didn't expect much from a place this cheap but it was way below the standards of the competition surrounding them. The egg custard, which in my opinion defines any dim sum place, was lacking the sweet smooth flavor in the custard as well as the flaky buttery crust which in this case tasted like frozen pie crust. \n\nBy paying just a little more at other places (basically 2 dollars), you'll be way more satisfied in the quality of the food as well as the passion that goes into a true dim sum cafe in the heart of chinatown.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-12-17", "description": "If there's one thing I learned after eating here is \"never trust any restaurant that advertises dimsum buffet with cheap graphics in a tour guide!\"  The only thing I take comfort in is that I wasn't the person that chose the restaurant.  My friends visiting from out of town actually chose the restaurant out of a tour guide and the \"$5.99 dimsum buffet\" ad caught their attention, so we ended up there.  We were driving in and being that the place was in Chinatown, parking and traffic was going to be a hassle to deal with.\n\nAt first glance the place looked really ghetto, but it had a really nice bright yellow canopy.  When you walk in, it's a completely different story.  I remember sizing the place up as I was slowly walking cautiously in as my friend was making the arrangements to eat in.  There were no decorations on the wall and the floor looked like the kind you'd hose down at the end of the day at a meat market.  I guess the best way to describe my impression of the place is \"picture yourself in the worst neighborhood of your hometown and how soon you'd want to get out of there\" and you pretty much get an idea of how I felt about this place.\n\nAfter paying the money we made our way to the available food.  It isn't all the time I see the eating utensils and napkins in troughs in front of you, but I tried not to notice.   The restroom at the back of the restaurant was your typical hole in the wall, but I had to laugh when the sign in front of the door says 'Restrooms are for Paying Customers Only,' while there is a small token/coin device at the lock on the door.  I guess if you didn't want to buy the food and use the bathroom, you could just pay a quarter or something and still be considered a \"paying customer.\"\n\nAs far as the dining experience goes, if you can get past the annoying advertisement that is played at full volume complete with the music accompanying Chinese Lion Dancing followed by the \"5.99 All You Can Eat Per Person\" announcement playing repeatedly off of a small computer monitor at the front of the restaurant, you're good.  We were there for at least an hour, so for us it was a huge test of patience while trying to eat and have a conversation.\n\nAs for the food, it seemed like it had been out for a while.  The only things that I thought was edible were probably the steamed siu mai and dumplings.  Everything else seemed hard or cold when I got to it.  And then there was the egg custard.  Is there supposed to be an oil layer on top of it?  The crust was flaky and I could taste an egg, but I wouldn't call it tasty.  Oh, and as for the hot beverages, they only had tea and hot water, so if you had a penchant for burning your tongue off, then this place is perfect for you.\n\nFinal thought, if you just want the novelty of the sights and sounds of this place, go for it.  Just don't stick around for very long and eat there.", "author": "Ray N."}

Yes, it's cheap ($5.99), but. If you're frugal, do yourself a favor and pay 2 or 3 more dollars elsewhere to get better dim sum.\n\nThe selection isn't that great, and some foods are excluded from the buffet section. At first, you may get excited by that huge tray of egg tarts (dan ta), it looks pretty good. Don't take too many, it tastes more like stale bread and eggs. Good egg tarts are sweet, flaky, and the egg part is somewhat creamy. But here at dick lee's, the egg part is chunky.\n\nThe sesame balls aren't very good either. Good ones are slightly crunchy with soft filling. Here, it's opposite. And it's extremely greasy as well, like everything else they serve. \n\nI am very sure you've had better $5.99 food.

We stopped in with the promise of all you can eat for about $6, which is a bit pricey considering what you can get in neighboring places for that price. \n\nWe should have checked it out and walked the line before shelling out the monies. The horror....\n\nThe interior is like a cafeteria. They give you a little \"kit\" of disposable dinnerware and off you go. The hubband noticed that they liked to position the tongs as inconveniently as possible for the high-value meat items. The aesthetic went well with their continuous loop over the loudspeaker announcing what they offer in the buffet. \n\nShu mai was more of a solid pork meatball with drying skin. There was a slightly tainted flavor that I couldn't tell was rot or a bad recipe. There were no shrimp dumplings I could see (dammit!) but I did pick out a couple sad-looking scallop (?) dumplings. The skins were shiny and looked old. The scallop or whatever seafood was in there had the same tainted flavor as the pork so maybe it was just an odd chinese herb they used. Nevertheless, I spit out the second dumpling.\n\nThere was an abundance of pork meatball-like items. The two pork rib-meat thingys tasted about the same. I didn't see any shrimp anywhere. The bbq pork steamed buns had a pretty tasty filling but the bun was over-steamed making it too moist. \n\nThe wontons in the wonton soup were edible though the broth was basically water and the pork filling the same as all the other pork meatballs. \n\nThe egg custard wasn't too bad. The pastry was flaky and a little crunchy. The custard was very eggy and not really sweet at all (are they supposed to be? I'm not incredibly familiar). It was edible. possibly enjoyable, and not repulsive. \n\nI was bit afraid of the hot line. The bbq chicken was ok though I was horrified to see them taking the over-cooked bits and casually tossing it into an adjacent dish (wtf?). There were mysterious fried things and cheap chinese fare that wouldn't pass the quality test of the local grocery store's deli counter.\n\nI'm back in Seattle now and the first place we're eating is the city's cheapest, best dim sum place so I can learn to love dim sum again.

I've been here many times when I'm in San Francisco. I always make a stop here for lunch or dinner when I am in Chinatown. Today, I had dinner here and I enjoyed it. The worker/cashier is friendly and there are many authentic chinese home cooked hot items to choose from along with dim sum selections. Dim sum includes pork dumplings, egg tart, pork shu mai, shrimp dumplings, a variety of buns(bean or BBQ pork), congee(rice porridge, 4 different kinds of soups(hot sour, wonton, stewed beef or pork soup egg flower soups), fried chicken, roasted chicken, chow mein, fried rice, bok choy, tofu with meat sauce, BBQ pork, lotus dish, mixed vegetable with meat dish, and many more. Selection is great! For the price of an All-You-Can-Eat of $5.99 per person, it is a great price and the best in town! Especially if you are on a tight budget. The food is pretty decent  for me and for the price, you can't beat that. I would definetely come back again not having such high expectations like some of these yelpers have. I also have to say that somedays the quality is better than other days. Today, I found that the dim some quality was better than the last time I was here for lunch time. If they are really busy, then the food is more fresh as they try to replenish it more often. Hot tea used to come with the meal but today, they said they would charge an additional .50 cents. I've been here for years and this was the first on that. It should come with the meal like it always had. Also, the place is not all that clean(hole in the wall). You get a paper plate and a bowl. You can order a la carte and get real dishes. I always prefer the AYCE because I like selection and there is no waiting for the food, especially if you are in a rush to eat and go. Like I said, don't expect much. Food is decent and for the price, you can't beat that,especially on a budget.\n\nUpdate 8/2016 No more hot food entrees for all you can eat. All you can eat is limited to some dim sum Only. Terrible! Lunch is $5.99 which is a good deal so it lures tourists in by the cheap price. You get what you pay for. I heard him say dinner is $7.99. Selection is very small- All you can eat is dim sum only. Before, they had soups and hot entrees and it used to be self serve. Now, you have to order the dim sum and it's not self serve. They were suppose to bring it out to us and they didn't for about 20 minutes. So I asked the owner where my food was. After 20 minutes, he told me to get the dim sum myself. He should have told me that earlier so I don't waste all my time for nothing! Dim sum wasn't good and it took forever to get the food. Bbq pork buns tasted bad-it seemed old and sitting in the steamer too long. Shu- Mai's  tasted better since it was fresher and big. I gave two stars because they didn't charge for my kids and the owner seemed nice. I kept asking him where my food was because we sat there for about 20 minutes. Very disorganized.Bring back the old way with more hot food selections besides dim sum and make it self serve like you did in the past. I won't be coming back unless they had it like before. What a disappointment. The good news is that I never gotten sick here so far which is surprising because some of the Shu Mai meat is pink. Another positive feedback is that the food is a good deal for $5.99 but it was not very good. Like I said. You get what you pay for. I feel bad to writing this review because the owner seemed nice and friendly to customers and originally I gave them 5 stars.

When you're a starving student, you tend to find good cheap places.  I loved their dim sum but most of all...their sesame balls -- especially the red bean or the black bean ones; yellow was ok, but it was a bit too sweet.  Their sesame balls were always warm and so mouthwatering good.  They were extremely cheap as well.  How I loved Dick Lee's in my early twenties.\n\nFast forward *cough* almost 20 years later...I was wandering around Chinatown, cranky, pissy and cursing at myself for even thinking of venturing out into the city. I had taken Bart in and it was packed. I let my feet do the walking because I wanted to visit old stomping grounds and see if they were as wonderful as I remembered them.\n\nI found myself in front of Dick Lee's. It was STILL $5.99 for a dim sum buffet. Nothing's changed.  It's still crowded because they decided to add in another table. The $5.99 dim sum buffet included canned sodas -- all you can drink to boot.\n\nTheir sesame balls and all their other dim sum was just as yummy as I remembered. It's pretty authentic and not for the faint hearted.\n\nMy husband was with me and started to get squeamish. Please.  We've been to scarier places when we lived in Scotland.\n\nHe was pleasantly surprised when he ordered his dim sum.  I'm not sure if we will go back...snotty Euro-peon that he is.  :p\n\nTheir decor leaves a lot to be desired. It's not really decor as much as it just boxes. Dick Lee's always reminded me of a house that someone decided (on a whim) to make into a restaurant because someone told the owners that they make good food. They put in tables, but it was never really pulled together. When you visit, you'll see what I mean.\n\nIf you're looking to drive to get here...good luck.  Street parking is awful.  If you can't parallel park, please -- don't drive, you will give the City dwellers even more things to get worked up over.
