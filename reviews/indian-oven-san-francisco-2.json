I love food here and I can't even express how many times I have thought about this spot on regular day. I came here with friends from work because one lives around the corner and they have been here before especially ordering out. I love how many different currys options they have and even vegan options! I got Coconut Shrimp, which is coconut milk based curry with shrimp, so good! This perfect dish goes well with rice and their amazing naan! We got veggie appetizers and 3 different types of naan, some I don't know even know, but they all were very good and delicious! \n\nI came here twice so far and had absolutely wonderful time catching up with friends and eating their amazing curry. I absolutely have no complains about the food, it was fresh, delicious and not too pricy! Coming back soon for sure!", "author": "Galya T."}

Got a table right away and the inside is pretty nice.\n\nWe ordered naan, saag paneer (palak paneer) and butter chicken (probably called murgh makhani on the menu). I didn't have a lot of expectations coming in but the food turned out to be quite nice. Naan was soft and both the dishes had the right taste, they could have much more flavor though.\n\nI would only rate this 3.5 (with 3 being average and 4 being very good). It was good Indian food but barely above average. Not bad for a casual meal, it's pretty reasonably priced as well!", "author": "Vignesh B."}

The order arrived at 4:20. The food was warm. I could forgive the slow delivery if the food was good. The Pulao rice was not \"studded\" with peas as described, the Murgh Masala (supposedly their specialty) was boring, and 2 tiny Gulab Jumun for $3.50. The garlic naan was good and the Navratan Korma was fair but far from good. Guess I keep going to the east bay for BEST Indian food.", "author": "Janine K."}

On Saturday, January 9th, I decided to try Clay Oven on Haight for lunch. I placed my delivery order through delivery.com around 11:20pm. It arrived around 12:15pm.\n\nPrices below are what I paid using delivery.com. Looking at their online menu, it looks like prices are a $1 higher per item, so I paid $4 more than ordering through their online system. I got a standard 10% off with delivery.com plus a 30% off coupon code, so it was worth it for me. Without any discounts, order through their site since it's cheaper.\n\n*Vegetable samosa ($5.95): homemade crisp patties, stuffed with fresh potatoes and peas, served with homemade mint chutney and hot and sour tamarind chutney\n*Chicken tikka masala ($13.95): clay oven roasted chicken in creamy sauce, spicy hot\n*Garlic nan ($3.95): leavened bread stuffed with fresh garlic\n*Onion kulcha ($3.95): nan stuffed with onion\n\nThe veggie samosas were crispy on the outside and soft inside. Good for dipping in the mint chutney or curry. The tikka masala was nice and creamy. I wish it were a little spicier as it didn't have much heat. I picked the highest spice level too. But the flavors were good. I liked the garlic nan. It was soft with a nice chew. Good garlic flavor. The onion kulcha was a little too oily, wet and doughy for me. Both where charred a tad too much, but I still a good vehicle for the curry. If you like rice, it's good to note the curry came with a side of rice.\n\nGood option for Indian delivery. Just remember to order off their site and not delivery.com. You'll save yourself $1 per dish.", "author": "Elena N."}

All of the dishes we ordered were brightly flavored, fresh and well balanced.\n\nFor example, the lamb vindaloo (my fave) and murgh makhani, the sauces were well put together with subtle yet complex flavor profiles. Their respective meats were well cooked and flavorful without being completely drowned and overtaken by the sauce. The same with the vegetable biryani, each vegetable was distinct and flavorful and the rice was fresh, well seasoned, and bright. It really seemed like well-loved home cooking.\n\nOur waiter was very attentive and a consummate professional.\n\nHad it not been for the kitchen staff loudly gossiping and several times dropping and kicking around stainless steel hotel pans--I literally couldn't even hear myself talking at the far side of the restaurant--i would give 5 stars.", "author": "Travin T."}

Delivery.\n\nThe beautiful idea about delivery is that you expect to pay for the convenience of food being delivered on time and food tasting as if you were sitting right in the restaurant; except you'd enjoying the dinner in front of friends, family, or in front of a TV for the solo nights. \n\nApparently, Clay Oven fails in this simple request. A business they chose to be in which I had hoped delivered good food. I made a mistake of choosing a restaurant that was closer to home \"thinking\" it would be here quicker; big mistake. \n\nFood arrived over an hour and 15 minutes later - luke-warm to cold; ordered soup and biryani dish; no brainer for the restaurant. I quickly contacted the restaurant and stated if we paid a fairly good amount for food it should be hot and ready to enjoy; excuse was one their driver was caught in traffic; and two they were having car problems. Who's problem is this? \n\nIt's unfortunate that I have to make a critique on their business model rather than their food. I don't recommend ordering from them for delivery. This is an epic fail and hope they find a way to either NOT offer delivery or close business. Simple as that. Next.", "author": "Edgar M."}

The staff here is always very attentive and treated us with complimentary dessert more often than not. Just the best. Let's talk about food now. \n\n1. Malai Kofta: Always order spicy malai kofta. This is my family's favorite. Tender softness of kofta combined with hot yet sweet mix of curry sets the mood for dinner. This is not your run of the meal dinner. It is a dinner infused with flavor of balanced spices and straight up deliciousness. \n\n2. OKRA!!!: Seriously order the Okra. Don't doubt that recommendation. Order it very spicy. This is the jam. If you like okra at all (note okra is difficult to make), this is going to hit every note you can expect with okra. If you can't handle hot food, still order it hot. Just get a side of yogurt with it and enjoy this moment. \n\n3. Biryani: I am confident my family only comes visits me in the city for this biryani.

We asked for our bill 3 times. Idk how it was miscommunicated but we didn't get the bill until we finally walked up to the waiter and basically waited for him to print it for us.

The pakoras were alright but literally every other dish we got I have had better.  The saag paneer (kind of the test of an Indian restaurant, right?)  was so bland, practically flavorless.  It had a total of five pieces of paneer, also. The chana masala was waaay too spicy and hardly masala-ish.  And the dahl soup?  Boring. \n\nWill not be ordering from here again, sorry to say.\n\nUPDATE--So, this is weird (and slightly creepy). Literally hours after writing my review, I got a phone call from an unknown number that I did not answer. A few minutes after that, I got a long text from the same number, from someone from Indian Oven asking me to remove my review and promising to give me good food in the future. Very bizarre.

We waited almost 2 hours for our food (along with everyone else who was seated) but watched BAGS of delivery head out like lightening.

HANGRY people I can assure you.\n\nWe ordered Chicken Tiki Masala and it came with 4 pieces of small diced chicken and tasted like straight up like honey tomato sauce, eww.  We couldn't believe it, I thought it was a joke.  The Chicken Vindaloo we ordered good and was a decent portion but had ZERO kick.  Its supposed to be spicy like hellfire people. \n\nThey charge 5.95 for rice, no biggy right?  The catch is that they multiply that order times the number of people who are in your party.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-12-13", "description": "It's unfortunate since I really liked (note, past tense) their food.  The WHOLE problem is the delivery service.  The first time we had problems, the delivery took almost 2 hours, by the time the food came, we'd made sandwiches and ate those instead since we tend to only eat one meal a day.  I always put in my orders early to give the restaurant a chance to do the cooking before their evening dinner rush but they just sit on it and then make a tardy delivery.  The second time we ordered, and we tend to order almost $100 worth of food alone, it not only took almost 2 hours to get to us cold, but the delivery guy wouldn't give me the food until I paid cash for it; since I'd ordered online and put the tab on my credit card, I wasn't going to pay a second time and nicely told him I'd already paid via credit card, he wanted cash before he'd give me the food (I mean, I didn't want to go through the whole credit adjustment thing with my card when the charge shows up on my bill, so time consuming and too much time being put on hold and all that mess--and if you're not taking credit orders, what are you doing collecting my credit info for then???).  So we stood there arguing civilly and I finally demanded that he call his place and clear this up--all the while my food is getting colder and the guy is being delayed in delivering everyone else's food.  He doesn't speak English well so I assume he doesn't understand what I'm telling him but he finally calls his place, he looks sheepish and then says something like \"o, it's all good\" shaking his hands in that \"it's all taken care of\" gesture and backs off to go to his car.  Yea, I had tip money but had decided he didn't deserve it; your delivery guy ought to know what's going on before he leaves to make deliveries.  The last time we ordered, which now is over a year ago, the delivery service was so bad; we had guests coming over (the food itself from one of these Clay Oven is so good) so I put in the order early to insure it'd be here on time, and we waited and waited and waited, I called twice and was assured the order was on the way, the third call they didn't pick up the phone for.  We finally decided to just go out to eat at some other Indian restaurant before everything closes for the night (it was raining, we had wanted to stay home and watch a movie with our friends).  The next day I called again to let them know I wasn't paying for food I never got and was told the driver didn't get an answer when he rang the bell (our bell doesn't work so there's no ringing involved and there's a big sign telling people to knock on the door since the bell doesn't work) SO THE DRIVER JUST LEFT THE BAG OF FOOD IN FRONT OF THE BUILDING.  Right, like that's ever a good idea.  Don't know if the guy delivered to the wrong place and left the food, or if he'd left a bag in front of our house and someone walked off with it; doesn't matter anyway since we never received it.  This is so unfortunate since we really loved the food we'd gotten before from this place and I don't mind dropping close to $100 for good food but I do want delivery made and made close to the time expected, I think I'm fair as far as allowing 1-2 hours for delivery alone but obviously this isn't enough for some places so I withdraw my favors.  BTW, there's another Clay Oven on Haight, has the exact same address (231), so I have no idea if this is an entirely different restaurant or not--if it's a different place, they REALLY ought to change their name.  Since both have the same name and address, we no longer order food from either place because of these screw ups.

The food was just lackluster.\n\nSamosas:  I think (as another reviewer mentioned), that these were frozen and then fried up.

But upon closer inspection, I realized it was uncooked dough.\n\nPapadam: I think these are the oven baked ones, not the fried ones.  A bit stale, but not too bad.\n\nRegular and garlic naan: Couldn't tell the difference between the two.  Thankfully, the portion wasn't huge like other places where there's enough leftover to feed a family of four.\n\nWe ordered the following main dishes, but nothing really special to talk about.

First, the good: the order arrived promptly and was delivered by a friendly man. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Chicken Vindaloo along with rice and naan. \n\nNow the bad: I love spicy food, and it's pretty much impossible to make something too spicy for me, but Indian Oven succeeded. Neither I nor my partner could finish what we'd put on our plates, our mouths were burning beyond belief. I ended up drinking orange soda to try to ease the pain, which helped. But really, this food was unnecessarily spicy beyond the palate of 99.9% of people. It was physically painful to eat. I still have the leftovers in the fridge and will probably end up dumping them rather than subjecting myself to that abuse again. \n\nThere were no options given for heat level at the time of ordering; if Indian Oven likes to make their food with the fires of Diablo, I suggest they add options for mild/medium/hot so that diners can choose.  Until/unless they do, I suggest that anyone wanting to take a chance on this place take the initiative to specify your desired heat level, because otherwise you may end up with some very expensive and inedible food.\n\nI took off 3 stars for the food being inedibly spicy, even to a spicy food aficionado.  I took off another star because the prices were quite high.  All in all, a waste of $45.", "author": "David T."}

This place was legendary for great food up until about 6 years ago and then the food began a steady decline and more recently it seems they have no interest in making quality, flavorful food at all. It was always a bit expensive for Indian and the portions were always smaller than other Indian restaurants but the food was that good, you over looked those things. We have ordered delivery about 6+ times over the last year (always hoping it was just an off day the last time) and it has been \"meh\"- bland or worse. Tonight was the topper- ordered the Chick Tikka Masala, it was watery, really watery and flavorless and the Lamb Rogan Josh was filled with grease, we had to dump about 4 Tablespoons out before we could serve it. I mentioned the decline of food quality, and they mumbled something about the \"chef returned to India for awhile, but he's back now\"- nope, the chef has lost it (they have lost the chef, perhaps), Indian Oven is no longer a contender. We have now found our replacement \"go to\" for Indian on Market St (delivers to the Upper Haight)- however they are closed on Monday which led us to give Indian Oven one more try and our last.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-21", "description": "While on the hunt for Indian food, we came across Indian Oven. We initially expected it to be a typical casual dining spot, but upon walking in, we were a bit taken aback by the nice white tablecloths, cloth napkins, and fancy layouts. Suspecting it to be finer dining than we were looking for, we got a table and perused the menu. Sure enough, this wasn't no Naan and Curry joint and the debate came up to find something a bit cheaper. But to be honest, I've not had \"fancy\" Indian food yet, so I figured let's give it a shot.\n\nWe went through the menu, asked a few questions, then placed our order: paneer tikka masala for me and tandoori chicken for him, along with a side of rice and garlic naan. The food took a bit longer to come out than you would aim for a more casual establishment, but as I said, this place was quite a bit fancier than a $7 plate of Indian food.\n\nMy tikka masala came out in a dish, chunks of paneer floating in a light orange creamy sauce. The rice and naan came out at the same time, and within a minute, this incredibly loud, hissing, steaming plate of chicken with veggies was delivered. Just the presentation of the tandoori made me boggle. We jumped into our meal with enthusiasm!\n\nThe tikka masala was great, very smooth, delicate, and the flavours were subtle. I'll confess, it wasn't the best I've had, as the one I'm in love with has a strong tomato flavour which this one lacked, but it definitely stood out as different and well done. Paired up with some rice and naan, I ate as much as I could.\n\nThe winner of lunch though was the tandoori chicken. The charred bits didn't take over the individual pieces of boneless chicken but there was enough to make it delicious. I can't actually say how it tasted, since I didn't partake of any but given my friend's absolute joy over his meal, I'd have to say it was a hit. The meat fell apart under his fork, requiring no knife to cut it, and the lack of bones meant he had five juicy pieces of chicken to partake of. \n\nThe overall cost of the meal wasn't bad when compared to the quality of the food and the fine dining experience we had, but this isn't a place to go if you're looking for a cheap $12 lunch out. On the other hand though, if you're looking for some high quality Indian food, you can't miss out if you try this.", "author": "Cassandra J."}

My friends and I were trying to get into Maven around the corner but decided that a 90 min wait was just too long so we stopped by this place.  I've been here a number of times in the past and never had any complaints - the food has been quite good, actually.  However, the last time was a couple of years ago - how much could have changed?  Turns out EVERYTHING had changed.\n\nI asked for a table for five, and was told there would be no wait.  Strangely, half the tables were empty although somewhat disheveled.  It took the wait staff 10 mins to straighten a table out and seat us - whatever, no big deal.\n\nAfter another ten mins later and no attention from the wait staff, we finally managed to flag someone down to order five samosa and a tandoori platter to start and order the rest of our food.  Twenty mins go by before they manage to serve us samosa - but only three.  Ten more mins for the next two, and no tandoori platter to be seen.  Turns out they served that to the wrong table, took it back, and then tried to serve it cold to us.  Then the rest of our order came, painfully slow and one dish at a time.  Worst part, it was all bland, under-spiced, and with rubbery meat.\n\nWhen the check finally arrived, to add insult to injury, they overcharged us for a dish that we ordered but they never served.

Reviews seemed okay enough and it's close enough to my place that I could have a go-to Indian takeout set. However, this place really disappoints. \n\nI ordered the naan, chicken saagwala and rice. The naan is decent, but the chicken saagwala was really a let down--it was incredibly bland. The spinach part of it was overall lacking the proper flavor and cohesiveness, with big chunks of tomato and onion that were still not cooked properly (onions were therefore crunchy.) That is definitely not how it's supposed to taste. The rice was honestly the best part, and sadly, that is the one item I could have made at home if I wasn't so lazy. \n\nTo be honest, I wouldn't mind the mediocrity of this place if it was priced accordingly.

Then, one of the dishes we were served was not what we had ordered (we got Paneer Tikka instead of Paneer Jalfrezi). I asked him to make sure it was Paneer Jalfrezi because the appearance was not what I had expected (did not match the description on the menu), and also because my sister's Vegetable Jalfrezi had actual vegetables in it whereas my \"Jalfrezi\" was not vegetables but rather an orange sauce.

A man (I think the owner) graciously approached us and offered inside and outside seating. We asked for outside and within a minute, 3 different staff members had carried a table, chairs, tablecloth, and silverware and set everything up for our enjoyment! We sat at the corner of the alley and Fillmore, so my view was a picturesque one of SF homes up a hill. We got papadum (which I've decided I want to have access to for snacking all the time, they're really tasty), a couple beers, Kashmiri Chicken, Saag Gosht and Garlic Naan (we passed on rice). The service was very nice and friendly, and the timing was relatively quick but in a good way. The garlic naan was well seasoned and baked fluffy. The chicken had a yummy buttery sauce. Both dishes had plenty of meat in them (thumbs up!). The lamb and spinach sauce was equally delicious. We wiped both dishes clean and stuffed ourselves to the brim  (happily!). The dessert menu looked delicious, though we didn't have room for much else.

After we had handed over our credit cards to pay, it took them ~15 minutes to get back to us.\n\nMy biggest complaint was the food, though. I ordered a salad. Nothing in there was fresh. It was if the cucumbers had been drained or they were simply dried out. There were some rotten spots on them. \n\nI won't go again.

With no apparent excuse, because the restaurant was half empty. \nWe won't be back any time soon, the experience was that bad and no apologies or discounts for the shitty service. \nWe had to repeatedly ask other personnel about our food and never really had the attention of our waiter who would disappear and resurface just to ignore us. The Most bizarre restaurant experience in a very long time. It's like they collectively forgot how and what to do as a restaurant for their patrons. \nWe ordered samosas, which is pretty standard,  but we had to inquire  after a half an hour and to our surprise they were served undercooked and cold and without sauce. When we received the new order, they too were served without sauces and when sauces were provided no serving utensils given, Wtf! Just One screw up after the next. \nThe main dishes finally came out after having to be made twice, because the first set sat so long they went cold and had to be remade. Where's the rice, again like they completely forgot what they were doing. The rice finally came out and again to our surprise, was undercooked and that to had to be sent back. I could only shake my head at this point and say, how is this possible, they can't even get the rice thing down, even though it's a standard for any Indian restaurant...\nGood luck with your business Indian oven.

I wanted to love this place because of all the positive reviews on GrubHub and because the server a) looked like a Bollywood actor and b) was super friendly and awesome. Unfortunately, my dreams of a Bollywood-style dance sequence happening on my tastebuds were left unfulfilled. \n\nThe chicken tikki masala had what I can only describe as an \"off\" taste. My husband said it tasted like tomato soup with lots of charcoal in it. The chunks of chicken were very large and when I bit into one it was grey in the middle. I could not eat much of this dish.\n\nThe potato saag was truly devoid of flavor. I make saag regularly because I love it, so this was a big disappointment for me. It had zero spices that I could identify, including salt. Thankfully, I got the pickles which were SO salty that no human could eat them unless smothered in mounds of unsalted spinach goo. So, that problem solved itself.\n\nLastly, the pakora were the style that remind me of the sweet and sour chicken on a Chinese buffet - really smooth and puffy and not thin and stuck to the shape of the vegetable. I don't know what the difference is in technique (wet batter vs. dry?), but I know that I prefer the latter. The sauces that came with the pakora were flavorful and interesting.\n\nMy search for the perfect Indian delivery continues!", "author": "Emily S."}

Here's the rundown:\n\nLocation: It's right on Fillmore in Lower Haight, which is perfect for some grub before bar hopping or even just a good spot to grab dinner in general!\n\nVenue: This is a nice place. White table clothes, white napkins, candles, and rustic Indian artwork... Don't worry, it's still casual enough to get away with jeans and a hoodie -- just don't go in looking all scrubby! It's a small place, but they've strategically laid out the tables to optimize their space. On a late Monday night, the place was busy, but we didn't have to wait for a table for 2. It's well lit and can get a little loud just from all the chatter at nearby tables, but you don't have to yell to be heard by the rest of your party.\n\nFood: We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala (of course) and Bombay Chicken (I think that's what it was...). Instead of rice, we just got some Garlic Naan and Goat Cheese Naan. Our food came out in about 10 minutes or so, but before then, we were served an couple sheets of a crispy thin bread (almost like a cracker, but thinner) and four different toppings. One was a sweet jelly, two of them were more of a liquid consistency and were slightly spicy, and the last one had some solid pieces in there, but I still have no idea what it was.  When our food came out, they set the Chicken Tikka Masala over the little candle, which I thought was cool. It was made to hold the small serving dish and I guess it was supposed to help keep it warm. The Bombay Chicken was just served in an oblong container, no frills. The Tikka Masala was delicious! The chunks of chicken breast were still moist, and the sauce was flavorful. I scooped up the sauce with my Garlic Naan for a tasty treat. The Bombay Chicken was also pretty good, although it didn't contain those nice chunks of white chicken breast meat -- instead it was more variable pieces of meat with the skin still attached on. It did have a nice kick, which I appreciated since I love spicy food. I wasn't a big fan of the Goat Cheese Naan, though. Maybe because I'm not a huge fan of goat cheese to begin with, but one small slice was enough and then I just stuck to the Garlic Naan.\n\nCost: For our two dishes, Garlic Naan, and Goat Cheese Naan, our total was about $40. Kind of pricey, but we did have some leftovers. I might come back again just because it's  great location and it's good food with great service. However, I'll have to try out some other places for their Chicken Tikka Masala before claiming it's the best.\n\nLooking for tasty Indian food? Check this place out!", "author": "Leana L."}

I asked our waiter if all naan cost the same and he said yes. Yeah... my garlic one was a dollar more than the regular naan, thanks. The chicken tikka masala was okay. Oh, rice doesn't come with the dish... you'd have to pay separate too. So I took the curry home.\n\nThe portions were okay... rice and free naan would've made the experience better.

We had the dal soup, the meat platter, chicken korma, and saag paneer. Everything was ok, but definitely not great. Underspiced for sure - for example I ordered the chicken korma medium spicy but it was less than mild. Everything just tasted far too bland. The service was also underwhelming, from the timing of the food as it came out to the speed with which we got a second drink. And it was a quiet night, not at all busy. Will I give it another chance some day - maybe, because it is right near by and I will say the Naan was done just right. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic Indian meal.", "author": "Rebecca M."}

The atmosphere is quite nice, for such a small restaurant they are definitely making the effort to be fancy.\n\nI thought the menu was priced a bit high, but looked past it at first. As I ordered an entree and had to pay extra for rice and naan (those not cheap either) I was thinking the food must be good and abundant.\n\nHere's what went wrong: the staff, trying to be classy, but couldn't get the orders straight. The prices, would be fine if the food was more/better, but in this case out of line with quantity and quality. The restaurant, nice solid furniture and decorations, but midway through our meal the very strange music got louder and louder until my husband and I looked at each and said at the same time \"let's get out of here!\". The service, we never received the thin cracker and sauce appetizer (the name is slipping my mind at the moment) we watched the other tables get. THE FOOD, most importantly, thin watery sauce and just barely an excuse for the entree listed on the menu. The naan was the worst I've ever seen and for the very first time in my Indian-eating experience I couldn't even get myself to finish it.\n\nEvery Indian place I've ever eaten (and that includes the very unclassy ones, e.g. Naan-n-curry style or worse) has had better food!

Only one other table was occupied  when we showed up on a Saturday afternoon for a late lunch, so to say they weren't too busy is a strong understatement.  Things started off pretty rough: Multiple water glasses at our table were dirty.  Even one of the replacements was dirty but we ended up just cutting our losses to avoid entering an infinite loop.\n\nThe appetizers/sauces were actually really good but everything went downhill from there.  Service was nonexistent, which was crazy considering the lack of patrons.  They got our order wrong and forgot to bring things out so many times that it created a sphincter-tightening awkwardness at our table.   Even getting our waters refilled seemed to require a Herculean effort on their part.  Service aside, the entrees were just awful.  Worst I've ever had.  Everything was watery and flavorless.  The vegetables tastes like they came out of a Jolly Green Giant Freezer bag.  The complimentary pudding provided to us maybe slightly offset the bad  service but did nothing to change the fact that the food sucked.  The new management (which I was previously unaware of) must have just shat all over this place.\n\nBottom line: Go somewhere else.", "author": "Chris P."}

The initial impression of nice, white tablecloths, prettily-folded napkins, and beautiful Indian frescos was quickly dispelled upon sitting down, when a hint of sewer smell came upon me.  (It didn't go away, but was eventually disguised by the tandoori chicken, thankfully).  After we sat down, I noticed my white napkin had a fresh yellow smudge of curry on it, and my plate had some unpleasant sprinkle and residue, and the flower vase (holding a sadly fading rose) had an old crusty splash of red sauce on it.  Glancing up while conversing with my dinner partner, I noticed the ceiling fan blades were super grimy, as I later discovered also was the bathroom.  It was all in such contrast to the initial impression and left me with a facade-crumbling feeling.  I was holding out hope that the food would knock me out of my socks, but no.  One of the slices of cucumber on the salad platter looked like it had fallen on a dirty floor (trulyl!!).  The salad dressing cruet (tasted and looked like viscous generic bottled Italian) had crusty, oily drips down the side around the handle (taken right from the fridge - so it had been put away like that, and taken out and served again like that).  The tandoori chicken was actually really good (but truthfully, that's kind of easy).  The chicken tikka masala tasted like Campbell's cream of tomato soup, the aloo matar and dal were bland.  The rice was fine.  I can't figure this one out . . . the years of Zagat ratings and \"Best of\" stickers in the window.  I will try every other SF Indian place around before I come back here.", "author": "D J."}

The host insisted a table was coming available. After some confusion walking upstairs and then back down, we were seated.\n\nA table seated after us got water. Us? Nope... The host came around after about 15 minutes to take our order and water finally showed up. We ordered and waited. In that time we watched one table get completely ignored for 20 minutes and leave. More chaos and confusion as waiters run around cleaning tables, but very little food makes it way out of the kitchen with just two cooks. After 45 minutes, we gave up. I told the server of the trouble, and to his credit, he said he would check on the order, but it was already after 9pm and my patience was up. He pressed for us to stay, so I tried to explain how I enjoyed their food, but this was unreasonable.\n\nIt makes me sad to have Indian Oven off my shortlist of beloved local restaurants, I understand there are busy or short-staffed nights, but then expectations need to be set or make some room to catch up.

I got the paneer makhata and it was subtly delicious.  Unlike most North Indian places I've been to, it doesn't beat you over the head with spices, it just gradually dissolves into delicious in your mouth.

I wasn't looking to venture very far from my apartment so I decided to head over to Indian Oven. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is well appointed and great care was taken to develop the ambiance of the space.  \n\nI ordered some Samosas to start.  The filling was very pleasant the the exterior dough was not too greasy.  I had hoped for a little bit more spice in the filling.  \n\nI was really impressed with the poppadom here.  This is the first Indian restaurant I had been to where there wasn't a fine sheen of clarified butter covering the wafers.  My impression of the naan was similar.  Very well made naan -- made to order in fact and they were not greasy one bit.  \n\nThe entrees of chicken tikka masala and madras chicken did not fare so well.  From the description of the madras chicken on the menu it had the promise of a wonderland of flavor, sadly what arrived at my table was nothing more than dried out chunks of chicken in a flavorless brown sauce.  My eyes searched the restaurant for a salt shaker each time a forkful hit my lips to no avail.  Chicken tikka masala is something I typically order at Indian restaurants and I realize no two places make it the same but this was really something out of the ordinary.  Once again, dried chunks of chicken but this time the sauce was flavorful and pleasing.  So pleasing, I found myself tasting it over and over again, but not because it tasted like chicken tikka masala.  Eventually, I came to the conclusion that the sauce was a tomato bisque that had some Indian spices casually added to it. \n\nI wanted to like Indian Oven when I walked in the door but sadly I was left without that satisfying sensation one gets from eating Indian food full of vim and vigor.", "author": "Adam P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-09", "description": "I had the worst Indian take-out in my life this past Friday evening.\n\nI had a hankering for Indian food and, after a few fairly mediocre recent experiences with Indian take-out places, I surfed the web in search of some better options. I came across the Indian Oven website -- I had eaten at Indian Oven many times in the past (admittedly, not recently....), and I found the place to be fun & the food to be tasty & spicy. Take-out from Indian Oven seemed like a good bet -- and, they now had an online ordering system, so I didnt even need to go through the usual confusion of ordering my dishes. I keyed everything in, very smooth and easy -- a few minutes later, I got a call from the restaurant confirming my order. Everything seemed to be very well organized and efficient.\n\nHowever, a LONG time went by - with no food. Then, I got a mysterious phone call from Igor (the Russian delivery guy, as it turned out.) They had managed to screw up my address - despite the fact that it was entered into the web order. He finally got to my house a little while later. But that was just the beginning my bad experience. I had ordered Chicken Vindaloo, and my friend got the Chicken Tikka Masala, along with rice and Samosas -- usually very reliable choices, and dishes I had had at the restaurant before. However, the Vindaloo was borderline inedible -- gray, disgusting, chewy chicken and hard potatoes in a heavily spiced thin soup. I came close to gagging, before I put it aside (and quickly, into the trash.) The Chicken Tikka Masala wasnt much better -- cold (a result of Igor's tour of the City, I suppose) and bland. The meat was slightly better than my dish, but overall, it was also very poor. Even the rice (described in the menu as \"studded\" with peas) contained almost no peas! Usually not a big deal - but here, it again pointed to the lack of interest Indian Oven had in serving good take-out food.\n\nI went to bed hungry and disgusted, with a bad taste in my mouth (from the appalling food, among other things.)\n\nThe restaurant may still be acceptable.

The service wasn't rushed this time, but the food still sucks arse. My chicken tikka masala didn't seem to have seen the inside of a tandoor, so it was more like chicken masala...and a really bland, watery masala at that. The naan breads are tiny, especially for the price...they're a bit more like chapati than naan...naan should be fatter & fluffier. The BF's lamb dish was equally as bland & the veggie samosas aren't any better than at 'naan n chutney'. If you want watered down, americanised indian, then maybe the Oven is the place for you. We'll stick with Pakwan in the mission - cheaper and way, way better. \n\nOriginal review:\n\nI grew up eating Indian food, having lived in the UK for most of my life, so I like to think I know good Indian food. Indian Oven isn't it...definitely the worst I've ever had. Considering the hype, awards and lines outside, I had high hopes...I've been looking for a restaurant that does Indian food the way they do back home and figured maybe this will finally be the end of my hunt. Alas, I'm still hunting.\n\nThe service was probably the worst part of the meal...my friend and I were so rushed, I felt like as though we were in a race with everyone else in the restaurant to see who could eat the fastest...our main course was brought out before we'd finished the appetizer and we were offered coffee and brought the bill whilst we were still munching on the entree. Not wanting indigestion, and being a cantankerous so-and-so, I made sure to eat as slow as I could.\n\nAs for the food...bland and watery. I had the chicken tikka...well, that's what they claimed it was. I think maybe they wafted the chicken above the marinade for a minute, rather than immersing it and letting it infuse. Result - chunks of tasteless chicken breast. I also had a vegetable curry as a side dish, which was an absolute joke...I think I counted three pieces of vegetable in there. It was more like a vegetable soup than a curry.\n\nSo, as you may have guessed, I will never again fork over my hard earned dosh for such crummy fare. If there's any justice in this world, people will see the light of day and this place will go out of business real soon. My advise, therefore, is to avoid it like the plague and head to Raja on the corner of Haight & Fillmore - there's no wait and the food is yummy...so much so, that I eat there at least twice a week. \n\nOven Schmoven.", "author": "Dan L."}

I almost jumped outta my chair when one of the staff dumped a bunch of silverware into the cabinet with a crash that was far louder than you might expect (think of someone nailing a crash cymbal right next to your ear). \n\nIndian Oven people - Maybe you could make more of an effort to limit the silverware noise pollution at the table right next to your upstairs wait station? Or maybe its a fun diversion for your wait staff to get people a jumpin' and a bumpin' around??\n\nI got a menu quickly and ordered a Taj Mahal beer and samosas before gf arrived. It took about 5 minutes for the samosas to come and they did so before said gf who arrived looking more than a little pissy telling me about the parking nightmare she endured to find a spot after dropping my gimpy ass off... sometimes this handicap does have its advantages. I calmed her down by letting her know that food and beer were to be had in very short order, that seemed to sorta work, I turned that frown upside down.\n\nWe ordered garlic naan, some nice rice, chicken tikka and aloo gobhi.  We both found the food to be fresh and very flavorful. The chutney was good and the yogurt a standout.  I did ask for extra spicy and wasn't very impressed by what they think \"extra spicy\" means. I got the caucasian version of extra spicy. C'mon people, when I ask for extra spicy, I want to FEEL my food. Also, while the garlic naan was good there wasn't much of it.  Anyhoo other than those very minor quibbles, everything was excellent.", "author": "Sam T."}

With such a large party, we ended up getting a ton of stuff; like 6 or 7 main dishes and some breads and appetizers.  I thought the samosas were really good, but their naan had a gummy consistency to it, and the goat cheese naan just didnt' taste good.  I believe we also got lentil wafers, which were delicious.  Among the main dishes, I really liked about half of them.  I don't necessarily know that the others were bad, so much as not really in line with my taste.  One thing I didn't appreciate, however, was the uncleanliness of their glasses.  The drinks all had a smell to them, and there were still stains encrusted on the rims of the glasses.

I went to the Oven tonight though without checking Yelp, and the wife and I were really surprised by a couple of things.\n1. The lack of a crowd and waiting list to get in. We've been about 5 - 10 times in the past 5 years or so and this is the first time we have been, on a Friday night nonetheless where there wasn't a wait. There were in fact several empty tables. We were pretty shocked. It did fill up by the time we left but there was still no wait. Strange.\n2. The food was not as good as we remembered it. Not knowing that the ownership has changed, I was a little confused by this. The samosas were very tasty, but everything else was mediocre. The Daal soup was bland, watery and tasteless. Campbell's soup tastes better. I had the fish masala, which is Chilean Sea Bass (I know, they shouldn't be serving this, I thought it was outlawed) in masala sauce with Daal and garlic naan. The fish masala was ok, but it was not as good as I remembered it from before. The naan was a bit chewy but satisfactory. The Daal was not bad, but not great. The wife ordered the mushroom and pea dish not spicy and it came out extremely spicy, almost to the point of not being able to eat it. \nIt's strange how you can sometimes sense things like a management or ownership change in a place you loved without knowing it beforehand. I definitely noticed a downgrade in quality, I just wasn't sure if my palate had been upgraded over time or what (I am in love with Amber India). I don't hate Indian Oven now, the dishes are fine, but they are not the same, sadly. They are watered down, too runny (the curries), and just not as good as they were. \nSorry to the staff and owners to criticize. I have a policy to almost always only write a Yelp review unless I can rave and pump up my experience at a place, but sometimes something needs to be said if it's a big disappointment. Our waiter was a perfect gentleman and nice, even though the service wasn't great. \nIn summary this is decent Indian food if you're in the hood but no longer worthy of going out of your way for. Too much competition for stellar Indian in the City now I guess (Dosa, Shalimar, Amber and that one in the Mission that people are raving about).", "author": "Matt H."}

There really was no question where we'd go to dinner. \n\nThe ambiance was lovely, white table cloths, waiters with sparkly silver trimmed vests, little vases of flowers on the table.  They have a real tandori oven to make the naan, the kitchen is open and bustling, the service is friendly and not too slow.\n\nWe ordered a lot of food.  The standouts were the Samosas (fried bits of heaven, not to be eaten everyday), Tandori Assorted (salad with different meats from the oven like lamb, chicken and kebab, to be eaten everyday), Lamb Jalfrezi (heart healthy with bell peppers and not too creamy sauce), Dal Saag (lentil and spinach, SO DELICIOUS!!!).  We ate and ate and ate.\n\nThe back half of the room was filled with a bunch of cooporate suits who kept standing up and making speeches which annoyed the Brits to no end.  But that's not the restaurants' fault.\n\nThis was seriously the best indian dinning experience i'd ever had.  The BF agreed.  The mix of flavors was just right.  The colors mingled on the plate.  There was a balance of creamy, savory, salads, healthy, delicious.  It was like we ordered the perfect combination.", "author": "Christina C."}

For the price, I don't think there was enough meat in the dishes.  We specified spicy for the vindaloo, but it wasn't very spicy and kind of watery.  The saag aloo was tasty, though.  \n\nThe tables are really close together, so it was difficult to squeeze into our seats.  The food came out superfast, though.  Our bill (after tax and tip) was $60, for three curries, three naans and one beer.  A little too pricey for the quality of food.

My husband and I never miss an opportunity to dine here when we travel to San Francisco - we plan trips around it. \n\nWe judge most indian restaurants by the sag paneer. Here, it's perfectly creamy and spicey without an overwhelming spice. The cheese cubes are the perfect texture. The samosa are perfectly cooked with plenty of vegetables, chicken korma rich and buttery, the rice is light and fluffy and flavorful, lamb vindaloo (very hot) is hot and delicious. Service is excellent and prompt. It's always packed so we do recommend reservations. Well worth a trip across town if necessary.

This was a Weds night and first thing I noticed the place had a  warm and cozy feel.  Then I took note that the place was about 3/4 full.  After being seated immediately I asked our waiter to let Norman know I had arrived.  5 minutes later we were very kindly greeted by Norman and I must say his attention to us and service his staff displayed were outstanding. \n\n We ordered the Papdum to start.  Nice flavor.  Shortly thereafter we were presented with 2 samosas which we did not order.  Very nice.  Complements of the house.  Our main entrees were the fish tandoori, full order of tandoori chicken and the lamb jaffrezi.  OMG, the fish tandoori melted in my mouth.  The sea bass was cooked perfectly and had a smoky taste.  The tandoori chicken was exceptionally moist.  The lamb was tender.  To end the meal Norman sent over an indian dessert for us.  Very nice.  The full order of the tandoori was huge and we ended up taking most of our food home.  \n\nAll in all this place did not disappoint.  The food, atmosphere and service top notch.  A far cry from my NYE experience.  We will be back again and again.   Norman put his $ where his mouth was and was very generous.  Thanks Norman for being passionate about your business.

We got chicken tikka masala, saag paneer, rice and naan. The chicken was \"barbecued\" and then the sauce was clearly added afterward. The result was a very odd combination of smoky chicken with your average tikka masala sauce. It was a very odd combination of flavors and it just clashed rather than going together.\n\nThe saag paneer was bland and the textures were terrible. The spinach (saag) was very solid, as in not saucy like it should be but just boring overcooked spinach. The texture of the paneer was worse, kind of rubbery and not creamy or rich like it should be. Very disappointing.\n\nThe naan was good, so that's what got it up to 2 stars.", "author": "John B."}

We read in other reviews that the food was less spicy and hence we ordered to make the Mutter Paneer and Dal Fry as spicy and that came as a little more spicy than expected. So the best thing I would suggest, is have them prepared as they do in their regular style (so that they do not mess up) and ask them for a separate spicy sauce (so that you can add as per your taste)\n\nThe papadum was very crispy.

We've been twice with groups of people and everything is underwhelming. \n\nFor instance last time I ordered Navratan Korma which they describe as \"Mixed vegetables in a delicately spiced cream sauce and cashew nuts\" I think Navartan means nine-gems so its nine nuts fruits and vegetables in a cream sauce. It's pretty flexible but was one of my favorite dishes in India and you can find great recipes online, like on YouTube by Manjula -- yummm. But this version was distinguished by paneer, peas, pineapple and pinenuts (instead of cashews)  floating in thin milky sauce. Also lima-like beans that were in a lot of the dishes that evening, although I don't  associate any of those dishes with lima beans.\n\n I'd always heard great things about this place so I might return again to see if I just didn't hit it right but I'm not too tempted.", "author": "jen n."}

They swore that it was the best in town so I tried it out.  And of course, I found that the food was excellent.  Each dish has a unique flavor, whereas other places I've tried seem to have dishes that kinda all taste the same.  The meats are tender and flavorful, and the sauces are spiced just right.  \n\nThis place is CLEAN, elegant, has great ambience, and the service is fantastic.  My favorite dishes are Chicken Korma, Aloo Gobhi, Saag Paneer, and Lamb Pasanda, which are all on the mild-spice side.  I am not a big fan of super spicy foods, so Indian Oven's large selection of mild and creamy/saucy dishes really appeals to me.  You can get super spicy dishes there, but I just prefer the milds, which are just as flavorful as the spicy dishes.  \n\nThe dishes are on the smaller side, so I'd say for 3 people order about 4 dishes and share.  Their rice is delicious and has whole cloves and cardamom in it to spice.  Their naan is great and they are the only place that has a sampler dish with various types of naan to try.  Indian Oven is the best Indian food in town, so try it out!  They even take reservations!  LOVE IT.", "author": "K N."}

In fact, it is the new owners that have made some excellent and much-needed changes....and in just the first two weeks.\n\nFor starters, the bathroom is now sparkling clean and smells great. This was a nontrivial problem for years that is now gone.\n\nAlso, the service is now well-paced. It used to be WAY too quick - so much so that it really ruined the meal experience. They have also added nice little touches, like free papadum with dipping sauces when you are seated. \n\nAwesome!\n\nThe wait staff also seem happier. I know it's weird to note, but the old staff just seemed miserable and they really brought down the experience of being there. Not anymore. On our last visit, the servers were upbeat and focused. The result is that the service was just right - attentive, pleasant, well-paced, and not overbearing.\n\nIn my estimation, the food quality has kept Indian Oven in business over the years. The food really is excellent. On our most recent visit, my girlfriend and I started with the samosas and then had chana masala and, of course, the lamb korma. As always, the dishes are the most reliable and the most delicious in town. \n\nNever had a bad meal here in over ten years. The recipes are solid.\n\nI like that they added Kingfisher on draft. It's not the world's greatest beer, but having it on draft brings out a flavor that you just can't get in the bottle. It's encouraging that the new owners are thinking about details like this.\n\nI was worried for a while that Indian Oven was in trouble, and I think it was. But, the new owners are considering the entire dining experience from top to bottom; and it definitely shows. They have made an immediate and noticeable difference and have brought up the level of service so that it now matches the high quality of the food.\n\nIt's amazing what concerned and aware owners can do to transform a venue.\n\nA++, Indian Oven.

As a self proclaimed Indian food connoisseur, this place has all the right things going for it. From the welcoming Nepalese staff to the smokey taste of their korma sauce, I simmered in the savory evening. \n\nIndeed, this is a \"higher end\" Indian restaurant, but there's no Dosa stick up its butt. (I love Dosa, but lets be real, it has a different vibe.) Indian Oven is warm, courteous  and mellow. \nOur party of 4 sat in the back room where it was a bit quieter and less sceney. We loved the 3 sauces and pickled veggies that came with the papadums - nice and full of flavor. The samosas were legit, crispy & filled with goodness, and paired perfectly with the sauces too. We shared 5 entrees, but probably only needed 4. However, that's what Indian at a restaurant is all about, sharing with a good group of peeps. We had the paneer korma and chicken korma, which was some of the best, most unique korma I have ever tasted. It had a smokey taste to it, almost chipotle-like, and richly delicious. I'm usually not a fan of paneer, as cheese doesn't seem to go with Indian seamlessly. However, this was awesome paneer and to boot, they had a goat cheese naan. It was an Indian quesadilla, unique and good. \nWe LOVED the fish tikka masala, it came out buttery and spicy. The saag aloo was awesome and hearty with great spices too. The lamb vindaloo was the only dish I wouldn't order again though, it just lacked moisture and good texture.\n\nMy other favorite thing was the rice pudding desert. I haven't had legit rice pudding since my days in the 'Desh. Milky, rich and sweetly spiced. \n\nOverall, it was simply amazing and I will certainly be returning soon. \n\nWell done IO, bhalo, khub bhalo.", "author": "Erin M."}

I find that most Indian places seem to get decorated by the same folks: it's always kinda empty, linen table clothes with the usual decor.  This place was unusual in that it felt just like any other lively restaurant- they just were serving Naan and curries instead of linguini w/ crab sauce.\n\nAnyhow, yeah the food here is good. I definitely enjoyed the Saag gosht(spinach w/lamb) and the poori!  The lamb was super tender and the creme spinach was flavorful.  I was super excited to see they had the poori here. I find that to be kinda rare.  You get 2 big ones for $3! Rice was not included however and apparently the portions are small. There were 5 of us, and we got 2 orders, which came on one small plate....so we had to order more.  I liked that the rice was flavored w/ safron and had peas in it, but it was a little underdone.  I didn't get to try the naan, but I noticed that 1 order of naan is a small basket with maybe 5 square pieces. The entree portions are also a little small...considering that rice is separate.  A friend ordered the Chicken Korma, which I snagged a bite from...very good. chicken might have been  a little dry.\n\nThe service was very attentive and friendly.  Bathrooms were clean and smelled really good!!\n\nOverall I'd say that the food is very good.  I think that it's comparable to most of the better indian places I have been too.

Many of the dishes are watery thin, which is dissatisfying when eaten with naan (see all the other reviewers below that confirm this). Its as if they try to extend the kitchen's output to many customers by just adding water. Unethical, and just plain stupid. \n\nThe tables are packed so tight, you WILL feel cramped and uncomfortable no matter where you sit. Its like chickens in a coop. Some of the chairs as just impossible to get to, unless you get on tiptoe and scrape your ass past someone else's table while they eat. It's not like this is done because the place is in such popular demand - it clearly feels like the idea was to maximize the number of diners per unit area. \n\nAh yes, finally, the price. This is the kind of restaurant that uses having white tablecloths as an excuse to justify adding 30-50% more to each dish's price. If the taste was good, one could swallow these prices. Here, it just sticks out as another example of the owner's greedy efforts to squeeze profits out of the wallets of unwitting customers (at least once before they get wiser). Hopefully they will read these reviews and avoid even that one time.\n\nOh by the way, the most interesting thing about the much raved about goat cheese naan is.... you guessed it, the novelty and the price ($5), but alas, not the taste.\n\nNish N and Sav B's reviews of this place are also right on the mark, and also solve the mystery of why this place manages to get inexplicably high reviews.", "author": "Shwin S."}

I'm sorry to say I would not go back unless I was told it had changed ownership or had actually improved significantly.

I guess after going to dozen of places that are hole-in-the-wall, a white tablecloth place seems a little odd to me. Well my former boss insisted it was the best in the city, so I figured why not check it out. I rarely get aggravated by poor service or crowds at a restaurants but this place was sure pushing it. I was there for dinner on a Saturday night (ya shoulda known better) the place was packed and it took 45 min to finally get seated. Once inside it was very crowded and overly formal, again unusual for Indian places i've been to in the city. Again forgetting that I was in a \"classy\" establishment I start looking around for the free chai... none to be found. Bummer but again to be expected. The other thing that irked me was our waiter not so subtly forced us to get rice along with our dishes. Ya... The food however was good, Tikka Masala was tender and a vegetable dish pretty tasty.

It didn't at all have the full flavor of dal.\n\nThe mushroom mattar had plain old gray/white mushrooms, not button mushrooms, which I much prefer in desi food. it just didn't work.  I ordered 'hot,' but it seems that all the extreme-capsaicin freaks in the area have lifted the bar -- this 'hot' is somewhere between medium and mild.\n\nThe raita follows the recipe that everyone knows.  1. beat yogurt 2. grate cucumbers 3. spice it up and mix.   At these prices, I would like to eat food from a chef who has own way of doing things.\n\nMy take-out order was ready in twenty minutes, which I find more than a little suspect.

The Boti Kabob was so tough no one could chew it and it was salty.  The Allou Gobi was watery, the Paneer was kind of like broken Tofu and bland, the Sag and and dal was bland. The Pilou was, well, rice with a few peas on top. The desserts were ok.  The service was either non existent or overpowering.  Waiters could not understand what was being asked of them. So 3 appetizers, 5 Main courses w/ rice, 4 desserts, 2 lassi, and 1 Chai.  The drinks were satisfactory. The meal cost us $175.00 before tip. I was shocked when I saw the bill.

I'm still not sure if I liked it because it felt like it was missing something. Same with the aloo ghobi.

We started out with the Gujarati kachori's and the onion bhajias. Let me add that they were made by an actual Gujarati so they WERE the actual thing! Then we went on to have the paneer mukhni, tikka masala, rogan josh, & the chicken vindaloo. They were not only spicy, but they were also flavorful and the right size. It seems as if restaurants give you such big portions that they have the doggie bag waiting by your order because they know that you're going to take it home!!! But anyway, the naans were warm and fluffy and the rice better than the average rice you get at other restaurants. It is a little expensive but you have to remember that a lot of work goes into a curry and the spices themselves aren't cheap. The only issue is parking- you have to search for it along the streets or in a parking garage which can become pricey. But in all, this restaurant is probably one of my favorites and I would definately come back again!!!", "author": "igy c."}

And I'm Indian, so every passerby has to ask what I think of their food. Even everytime I pass the damn street, there are at least 10 people standing outside as if they're in a line for free cocaine. So, eventually I decided to find one night and dive in with voluptuous apetite. It was a fine friday evening and surprisingly, there was no line. Wow..so I ordered the lentil soup, pulao and chicken korma (their speciality as I was told) ... the lentil soup was okay, but as soon as I tasted the curry - I knew something had gone wrong. Either my taste buds had gone under surgery or the food wasnt simply good. They dished out an entire can of tomato sauce over marinated chicken and served it with rice. So, I call the waiter and ask him whats wrong..he takes a sip of the curry and hauls back to the kitchen. He returns with a red scramble of curry... a bite of which drops me to the floor. This time its tomato puree mixed with red chili's - enough for entire Lower Haight to cry out loud. The rice was soggy and I left paying $30 for a half eaten dinner.  Just not worth it!", "author": "Sav B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-02-15", "description": "Nothing divides a nation like Indian food.  I'm going to side with the Indian Oven fans here because Indian Oven is absolutely, without a doubt, my favorite Indian restaurant.  \n\nHere's why I love Indian Oven: \n1.  People complain about the prices and, yes, the meat dishes look pricey, but their vegetarian dishes are all several dollars cheaper.  So, for people who like their veggies, a vegetarian entree at Indian Oven costs about a dollar or two more than a vegetarian entree at most of the cheap, fast-food style Indian/Pakistani places in town--which is quite a steal considering the quality at Indian Oven!\n2.  Their vegetables taste fresh.  I like Indian food that tastes like it's been simmering in a giant pot all day as much as the next person, but I LOVE Indian food that tastes like it was prepared just now, specially for you.\n3.  Their paneer is the best I've tasted.  It's a bit more tender than the paneer served at most other places.\n4.  Service is always very friendly and not overbearing.\n5.  Their spices are always perfect (in my opinion, of course).  No one spice ever overpowers the others, nor do the spices detract from the vegetables.  Every part of the dish gets an opportunity to show off.  The spice perfection is probably my favorite part of Indian Oven.  I think their samosas really showcase how carefully they handle their spices.  Try one!  Or two!\n6.  I tend to use saag/palak as a measure of an Indian restaurant's worth.  Is the spinach canned?  Has it been pureed into mush?  Is the restaurant covering up the canned mush flavor with too many spices?  Really, saag paneer or aloo saag is a great way to determine whether or not an Indian restaurant cares about its food!  Indian Oven passes the saag test with flying colors.  Fresh spinach; finely chopped, but not mushy; creamy, but not too heavy; little bites of fresh ginger; delicate spices with a slight kick.  Mmmmmm.\n7.  They're hip to the vegans.  You can order many vegetarian dishes and request that they're made \"vegan,\" and they'll know what you're talking about.\n\nPeople look for different things in Indian restaurants, so some folks won't much care for Indian Oven.  But for me?  Indian Oven is IT.  Maybe you'll like it, too.", "author": "Alyson Y."}

I have to admit that my expectations were probably a bit too high since two of my friends (who are also Indian) had raved about the place quite a bit.  First, the ambiance is pretty decent.  I've almost come to expect a dingy, dark decor at an Indian restaurant, but the upstairs at Indian Oven was pretty nice.  The restaurant was well lit and clean.  The location of the bathroom was a little odd and the tables were a little close together, but other than that, I was pleasantly surprised by the physical location.  I think the place would even be OK for a date.  Now for the food... for starters, my two friends and I shared the Chicken Pakora and Tandoori Assorted.  The pakoras were pretty tough.  The chicken just didn't have a lot of taste.  I really liked the Tandoori assorted platter though.  All 3 of the different meats were very juicy and flavorful.  For entrees, we shared the Chicken Korma, Bhuna Ghost and Jheenga Masala.  The Chicken Korma was pretty good.  A lot of times the sauce can be too watery or too thick, but the consistency was just right.  Also, the chicken pieces were moist and tasty.  I was pretty disappointed by the Bhuna Ghost.  As soon as we got menus, both of my friends went straight to that dish.  However, the lamb pieces were pretty tough and fatty.  It just didn't do anything for me.  The Jheenga Masala was tasty and had a good amount of shrimp.  We also ordered some regular naan and garlic naan.  The naan was satisfactory, but nothing special.  Overall, the service was pretty good.  Our waiter was responsive and friendly.  It's a bit out of the way for me... all the way out in the Lower Haight, but I'm pretty sure I'll go back at some point when I need my Indian fix.  Being Indian, I'm pretty picky about the food my peeps serve, but was overall pretty pleased with my experience at Indian Oven.", "author": "Saw T."}

If you're looking for a place to go when your folks (hopefully they're buying) or business colleagues (yeah expense account) are in town or you need to show all your friends how much cash you carry thanks to your new raise or bonus then by all means go. The truth is there is more affordable Indian that is on par with Indian Oven's quality. Granted they have some \"traditional\" dishes that others don't and they throw a bone (I mean plant stem) to the vegetarian friend you might have. To be honest I have two friends who prefer this place to many others in the city, so there is no way to truly know unless you test it out yourself. Service is great. Parking takes a C- not for availability but for quality. The area may not meet with your level of urban comfort (i.e. people screaming snitch and I'll kill you because you're a cop caller).

I think the food was okay or good or not really what I was expecting, but I can't really tell you what I had or why I liked it/disliked it. I remember being hungry even after I ate part of my boyfriend's portion, so I think that the entrees were too small (especially for the price - I do remember my bill being well over what I was wanting to pay). I think the place was trying to hard to be fancy and romantic, and I wasn't into the decorating and cheesy table adornments (I remember white tablecloths, maybe candles and/or flowers? Ew.)
