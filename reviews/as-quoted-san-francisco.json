{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-28", "description": "The menu is short, sweet, and simple and the restaurant set up/decor is very aesthetically pleasing. I've gone during the week and on weekends and they're never empty. I've also tried to study here a couple times and I personally don't think this is the best study spot. It does get a bit noisy and their seats aren't the most comfortable to sit in for a few hours. However, it is always clean, the seats are crowded next to each other, wifi is included, and the servers are very nice. \n\nI've tried the organic matcha latte ($5), the taco salad ($15), and the organic avocado open face sandwich ($9). I am not the biggest fan of the organic matcha latte. The matcha latte was a bit bitter and didn't really taste like matcha. The avocado open face sandwich was delicious and flavorful, however, their home made gluten free bread seemed to make the meal a little too heavy for me. The avocado \"spread\" included radishes, avocado, chives, mayo, sea salt and crushed red pepper. I would recommend sharing the avocado sandwich as it is very filling. And lastly, the taco salad, which is my favorite. The salad is a very large salad and will fill you up. It comes with romaine lettuce, chicken (white meat), cherry tomatoes, black beans, scallions, cilantro, tortilla strip chips, avocado, and a cumin vinaigrette. I HIGHLY recommend it. It will leave you feeling full but not stuffed. \n\nI used to stop by after work every now and then, at around 5:45PM, and pick up a salad to go but recently, the restaurant has changed it's hours to 7AM to 5PM on the week days and 8AM to 3PM on the weekends, which doesn't really work with my schedule so now I only go when I'm really craving the taco salad. Though I would recommend this spot, as you can see from the prices of the organic matcha tea latte, the taco salad, and the avocado open face sandwich, it's not the cheapest. So if you're looking for a healthy snack or meal that's on the cheaper side in the area, this isn't the spot.", "author": "Victoria H."}

But you can't tell them about it now as you are off to a Spinning class with a hot new instructor.\n\nOh wait.  This is a coffee review, right?  Absolutely the best! Coffee is coffee right?  No!

But you are making it really hard for me.\n\nThe ambiance is very cool, the menu is good but there are urgent issues they need to take care of.\n \nDear As Quoted, PLEASE:\n\n1. Clean your tables more often.\n\n2. Serve HOT beverages HOT, not lukewarm. Even though I and my friend asked for our hot chocolates to be extra hot (because hot means slightly warm in As Quoted standards), you served us them barely warm...  \n\n3. Bring customers' orders to their table if you give us numbers. Sometimes you bring my tea to my table, other times I wait for 15 - 20 minutes, get up and find it waiting for me on the counter, and it got cold. You don't even explain why it is there waiting for me cold and alone. You don't apologize. \n\nThe service quality is absolutely arbitrary.  If it's my lucky day the service is great, if it's not I feel like your employees will punch me if I ask for a thing. \n\n4. Work on your communication skills with your customers. \n\nThis is the interaction I had with one of your waitress today ( I am writing this because this is the 100th time this kind of thing happened), we asked for extra hot chocolates :), one with almond milk and the other is just regular. The waitress brought them to our table, asked us who ordered the unsweetened hot chocolate. I and my friend looked each other puzzled, then my friend said she ordered the one with almond milk. And the waitress gave that one to her, regular one to me. She left. \n\nSo what's the problem? \n\nYour hot chocolate is already unsweetened. And why am I telling this long story, because this kind of weird moments keep happening at your cafe...\n\nI wait for my order and it never comes, I find it cold on the counter after 20 minutes and your waitresses act like as if I am supposed to come and pick it from them. And I know it is not true. \n\nPLEASE WORK ON YOUR ATTITUDE. A simple sorry, or a clear question would do wonders for you. Your employees seem clueless about what they are during. \n\nThe messy, sloppy service and clumsy social interactions don't match with your elegant cafe & delicious food. \n\nYET, I will keep coming to your cafe because perhaps I am a masochist and I love your hot chocolate when it is hot.", "author": "S M."}

You'd be crazy not to try it (I don't have dietary restrictions nor am I vegan so please ask the staff if the muffin fits your needs). I can tell the drinks and food are made from high quality ingredients. The presentation of the food, beverages, and the cafe itself is beautiful. Very minimalist. It's a local spot too if you're into rich fitness moms and their stroller children who occasionally scream. The fallback is the lack of space in the cafe and the staff. They tend to confuse my order and I have to remind them to bring the correct one. Overall, 5/5 food and beverages, 3/5 service, and 4/5 atmosphere.\nP.s. shout out to the red-head barista.

He ordered a grapefruit brulee, and at $5+ a pop, knew that it would be a bit overpriced but was curious to try it out.  When they brought out a tiny half-grapefruit on a plate (and no serrated spoon to boot) he simply stated: \"When you are paying through the nose for a grapefruit, you expect a whole grapefruit\".  I pointed out the sprig of greenery on the corner his plate and that it was probably worth at least 50cents.  Seeing his displeasure, I encouraged him to go talk to them and ended up getting the second half after pointing out that the menu said \"grapefruit brulee\" and not \"half grapefruit brulee\".

I mean, look where it sits. That said, upon walking in, I felt like I had entered the space of two secret societies of San Francisco: philanthropic, wealthy ladies who lunch AND yoga/pilates/fast-paced power-walking women+men who drink cold-pressed juices in expensive work-out attire. Needless to say, this isn't a \"hipster\" place as some folks have described. To me, this was 100% yuppie. I think the clientele (based on my experience sitting there for a couple hours) comprised mostly of neighborhood folks who feel like strolling for \"something cute\" in the middle of the day. Now, admittedly, I too have an affinity for places like this hence why I dropped by. Plus, as a Pacific Heights resident, I welcome this addition to the 'hood. It's nice to have a high-end coffee shop in a neighborhood saturated with chains. \n\nThe decor: very bright, clean lines, simple and modern but elegant design. The space looks small from the outside but it's surprisingly big with generous seating options. It also appears there is a cozy outdoor area in the back. There's also a few tables and chairs in the front. The menu: it's a cafe with salads, sandwiches, soups, etc. There are juices, coffees, teas, and baked goods as well. I didn't have any of the food upon my first visit so I cannot comment on that. However, I ordered their iced latte and it was great. I also loved the shape of the glass and the way it was presented: white and brown swirls slowly moving inside not quite integrated to make that tan color of a latte. The service: solid. I met some of the staff and management and they were approachable. Lastly, the vibe: (see above) it may be upscale-ish but thankfully not stuffy despite one's perceptions of the crowd. It's also a good spot to do a little work. I read and write a lot so this is an ideal cafe to do just that. \n\nI know I'll be back especially since it's a hop, skip, and a jump away from my place.

If you're desperate, there's a garage 1 block away at 3490 California Street. It's $2.00 every 20 minutes. \n\nAlso, most of their clientele are from the neighborhood...and by neighborhood, I mean Presidio Heights' million million million dollar homes...so, ritzy middle-aged mommas dressed very nicely.

I forked over $3 for barely passable Americano before finding out this place offers only high carb white sugar or high carb organic date sugar (maybe it was coconut sugar) as sweeteners. Is this some new niche marketing angle?  I asked the barista if she had Splenda or Stevia hiding somewhere and her response  was \" no, we only offer healthy sugars.\"  Seriously? The owners need to watch \"That Sugar Movie\" if they think crappy processed sugar is better than Stevia. I ended up walking to Starbucks for sweetener which is where I'll be getting my next Americano, too.", "author": "Kim W."}

I only live a block and a half away so it's great to have a neighborhood cafe around. The premise seems like it's on point--slow food, local etc. The place has plenty of seating. It's all set up to be great but it fell short. Maybe because it's new and they're still figuring out the kinks? But really some things should be thought of immediately and remedied. I ordered the kale, avocado Caesar salad. All Caesar salads are pretty basic... They must have lettuce, Parmesan (they're using the cheaper pecorino) and croutons and the dressing. This ones a bit different because of the kale and avocado additions, which I'm totally fine with (I'm all for creativity). When the salad came out, it was a fine portion but to my discovery there were no croutons as listed. Croutons are essential to a Caesar salad. Maybe they just forgot so I asked. Nope. Apparently \"we've never had them. It's listed on the menu, but we haven't had them.\" 1) put a note on the sign! 2) don't call it a Caesar salad 3) if you don't do the rest tell us before we pay\nOk, so here's the funny thing. The barista meant well. She asked if I'd like a cookie or a slice of bread to make up for it. I said I'd take a slice of bread. She said \"normally it's extra for bread on the side\".... Hmm ok cool. Good to know. Minutes later the kitchen guy comes out apologizing with literally a slice of bread that he must've put in the toaster and cut up into little square pieces. What?! These aren't croutons. Don't even try to disguise it. Now I wanted a slice of bread but instead got some soft cubes with burnt edges. \n\nI'd like to try the turmeric latte. When I can justify spending $4 for it maybe I'll drop by again but I'm staying away from the disgrace of a \"Caesar\"", "author": "Stella H."}

There was one slice of bread, spread with mayo, covered with lettuce , 2 cherry tomatoes cut in half , and one piece of bacon! That was it.....all for $8.00.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-06", "description": "The store is very well designed and the espresso station is very cool. Very hi-tech. Coffee is badly needed in this neighborhood but, unfortunately, As Quoted falls short. I can't really say how good the coffee is, but given the wide availability of great beans locally, I'm going to assume it's good. Unfortunately, the barista did not know how to make coffee drinks. The milk in the cappuccino was way too hot and there was no foam. So the espresso was killed by too much, too hot, steamed milk. Not drinkable without letting it cool for 15 minutes but no point as the coffee was already dead. The best Blue Bottle innovation was not their beans or stores but the requirement that other shops who used their beans had to have their baristas trained.  Obviously not the case for the As Quoted beans provider. I assume that this barista was new, in training. But there is no reason at this point in time to have bad baristas at high end coffee shops in SF.   There's already a Starbucks in the neighborhood if you want bad coffee. And, unfortunately, Peets is better than the coffee I got at As Quoted. Neighborhood is still in need of a good coffee shop.", "author": "Neil B."}
