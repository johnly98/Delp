{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-20", "description": "Sheng Kee is THE Taiwanese bakery to go to when you're walking along Irving Street in the SF Sunset District.\n\nIf you're new to San Francisco and are looking for good Chinese food, I'll be frank, forget Chinatown. It's an important cultural and historical point, as well as the center for many festivals and great activities, but the truth is that a lot of the absolutely MOUTH-WATERING Chinese restaurants are in the Sunset District (seriously, look up Chinese restaurants with \"Outer Sunset, San Francisco, CA\" inputted into Yelp's location bar). To be fair, it's not just Chinese cuisine either. Part of this is probably because the Sunset District actually has a pretty dense Asian population.\n\nSheng Kee is a primarily Taiwanese bakery started by a Taiwanese woman and ran by a Taiwanese family and has a selection that competes with SOGO bakeries. They have around a dozen locations around the Bay Area, including Cupertino and Milpitas. So truth be told, Sheng Kee isn't actually all that new to me. What makes the the San Francisco bakeries so prominent is that they are both located on Irving Street, a road prominent for the delicious Chinese eateries lining a long stretch of it. The one down the street from this one is the FIRST one, established back in the 80's(?), while this one was opened much later on the other end of this stretch of eateries to keep up with demand. Both are conveniently placed so that, while looking for a place to eat or waiting for a table, people can easily stop by to pick up dessert before or after a meal as well as a great place to pick up tomorrow's bread/breakfast/snacks. \n\nThat's what made ME so happy. My friends and I came in on Sunday around 7PM (half an hour before they closed) to pick up desserts for after dinner. Despite it being so late, they still had a decent selection of breads, pastries, cookies, cakes, and cake slices. In fact, they had actually been putting out their last few trays as we got there. Not to mention, the employees were really friendly and helpful. And there was several of us asking her to put this cake or bread in a specific box and putting so-and-so boxes in this or that bag and...Kudos. Thank you SO much.\n\nLocation wise, this Sheng Kee is a real hole in the wall place. Overall, actually quite small. But they do have a few small chairs and tables next to the door and in front of the floor-to-ceiling table that are a good fit for one- or two-people parties. Additionally, they have some similar tables in the back as well as a couple of small tables with armchairs, still primarily set up for small parties of one or two. If you have a bigger party, try to claim and push together the smaller tables out in front as there really isn't room to do that in the back.\n\nParking is...challenging along Irving Street. More likely than not, if you're not taking public transportation, you're gonna have to try the surrounding street parking. If you can and you're lucky, try to grab one of the spots along Irving Street. If THAT doesn't work, be sure to check the street parking on the roads running adjacent to Irving (ex. 9th, 10th, 11th, etc.). My friends and I had parked in the Andronico's Community Market parking lot (turn from Irving onto Funston Ave, it'll be to your left. Turn from Irving onto 14th Ave, it'll be on your right). It's technically only for Andronico's customers only, and we did end up buying some groceries and midnight snacks from them before leaving.\n\nOverall, definitely drop in if you're passing by. If not to sit for a while, then to browse through what they have. It's primarily Taiwanese flavors and kinds of baked goods and snacks, but they're good at blending of familiar and unfamiliar flavors and recognizable pastries/snacks/bread. Or if you ARE familiar with Asian bakeries, breads, and flavors, then it's just a matter of a decent, convenient neighborhood Chinese bakery providing for your craving and needs.", "author": "Christine L."}

Neither did I, but I thought it would be much easier than it was.\n\nI was headed to either my niece's or my nephew's birthday party, and my brother asked if I could pick up some candles for the cake.  Nothing special, just those twisty multicolored waxy things we all remember from our childhood and that always seem to be lying around in random junk drawers, along with Elmer's glue, brassy thumbtacks (how long have those been there?), and old phone cords.\n\nI searched through all the drawers in my flat, but I couldn't find any cake candles.  (We had candles, but they were either votives or full-on Liberace-candelabra deals.  There was nothing small.)  I didn't feel like getting ripped off by Bi-Rite, so I hopped on the bus and figured I'd pick something up in the Inner Sunset.\n\nMy first stop was Golden Bear (https://www.yelp.com/biz/golden-bear-trading-company-san-francisco-3), but they barely have what they're supposed to, let alone candles, and really, who would want to waste time on actually stocking a market with things you can actually sell rather than providing your would-be customers with tons and tons of useless empty space?  I mean, everyone knows that San Franciscans like to pay too much for small portions, to have nowhere to sit, and when they do find places to sit to be uncomfortable.  It's all about standing in line and overpaying, right?\n\nNext was Royal Food Store (https://www.yelp.com/biz/royal-food-store-san-francisco).  No candles there, but at least they were helpful.  They suggested Rexall on 9th & Irving.\n\nI headed over there (https://www.yelp.com/biz/reliable-rexall-a-compounding-pharmacy-san-francisco-2) and was prepared to pay too much for the candles, but I knew they would have them.  I've always found what I'm looking for there, although it's usually shoddy and overpriced.  I searched the aisles in vain until one of the teenage-looking cashiers asked what I was looking for and told me they did not have candles.  She suggested Sheng Kee Bakery across Irving, and I was prepared either to walk all the way to Andronico's and pay through the nose for some organic beeswax or to just give up and show up to the party defeated, the person solely responsible for not ensuring the birthday cake was properly covered in grade-school saliva.\n\nIt was just across the street, so I figured I would give it a shot and have a funny story to tell.  I walked in, and I was surprised by how gleaming and bright and inviting the place was.  I would definitely have to come back and try something from here.  I didn't even look for anything; I just sheepishly got the cashier's attention and asked whether they carried birthday-cake candles.\n\nPrepared to be told no, I was almost turning around when he asked which size I wanted.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"We've got little ones, bigger ones, the numbers, whatever you need.\"\n\nI looked at where he was pointing, and there were, indeed, different candles right by the cash register.\n\n\"Do people buy a lot of these?\"\n\n\"All the time,\" he said.\n\nAnd so I succeeded, eventually.

The main problem is that everything is pre-mixed, so you can't request light sugar unless you ask them  to dilute it.  Otherwise, $2 for milk tea, boba option included, is quite a deal.  I especially like the HK milk tea, which features a supratherapeutic dose of caffeine.\n\n[THE BAKED GOODS]\n\nAll their pastries are deliciously buttery with a soft, flaky texture.  There are quite a lot of choices encompassing from savory to snack to dessert, traditional Chinese to fusion to western, and everything in between!

I am fairly and positively surprised I ran into Sheng Kee by a stroke of luck but this place fares well for a delicious Asian bakery. Definitely recommend- clean, fairly priced, and great service!\n\nAmbiance, Prices: A\nFood Quality, Service, Location: B\n\nI was leaving UCSF and wanted to stop by a Bank of America to withdraw cash in case of toll. As I was leaving BoA, I noticed Sheng Kee was next to it! A purely happy coincidence :) I headed straight in as the place looked alluring with its delicious baked goods. I figured that if I was leaving the city during rush hour (Thursday 4:30PM) that I was not going to brave the storm snack-less!\n\nIn I go through the door, the store interior is very airy and spacious. Directly in front of me is the cashier/bakery counter and to my left were the dining area and product shelves. Their selection and variety of baked goods were not as many as I had anticipated, perhaps because I have been spoiled by 85C? They also offered boba, coffe, and teas for cheap (less than $3). Regardless, they had the usual breads of hot dog, bacon, taro, bbq pork, etc. and additionally some new kinds such as milk and chocolate roll. I ended up buying 3 BBQ pork buns, 1 hot dog bun, and 1 green tea mochi bun. Total price came to $7.13 which was pretty cheap! The cashier was very cheery and pleasant and offered to place my buns in a box ;) Good solid experience. Nothing extraordinary but thankfully not a disappointing disaster.", "author": "Donna T."}

And the quality of bread here is actually pretty disappointing for a Sheng Kee. It never tastes fresh. I've tried both the butter bread and brioche bread and it's kind of hard and stale, even if I eat it on the same day. After sticking 'em in the fridge for a couple of days, they're no longer that edible. I'm not sure if this means they use less preservatives compared to other places like 85C (a butter bread from there is still soft after microwaving 3-4 days after purchasing, so long as you refrigerate it)...or if it's because they're selling bread that was baked a couple of days ago. I'm betting on the latter since bread from other Sheng Kee bakeries taste better.\n\nWith that said, the fried pork and fried fish sandwiches are really amazing and their cakes look good. The layout of the store is also very impressive - it's clean and bright and there's actually free WiFi and some seating in the back. I think it'd make a great place to study. They also serve Peet's coffee if you like your goodies with some caffeine (I do). \n\nFinally, they sell Beijing yogurt.

Walking into the bakery, I was a little confused at first because of their layout. The cake display and the register was in front of me and the pastries were located on my left. What's interesting is their method of selling pastries. You have to grab a tray near the door, place a tray cover on the tray, and grab tongs. Then you go to the pastry display case, open the window, and use the tongs to grab the pastry you want. \n\nMost of the pastries are typical Asian ones. But they do have different variations. I ended up getting the almond croissant, chocolate croissant, and pork sung green onion bun. The almond croissant was pretty good. The outer part of the pastry was flaky and the almond filling was flavorful. The chocolate croissant was good, but I think it would have been better if the chocolate was more melty. I really liked the pork sung green onion bun because it was different. The pastry was both salty and sweet. And the mix of flavors made it appealing to me. \n\nI went up to the counter to pay. The guy at the register wrapped everything up for me. I also wanted to get the fruit basket cake which had a mix of fruits. The fruit arrangement on top of the cake was very pretty. The strawberries, kiwi, and peaches made the cake look like a summery artwork. I was a little disappointed that the fruits in the middle of the cake were frozen though I wasn't surprised. My family didn't eat the cake until 6 hours later, but the fruits were still frozen.\n\nOverall, I thought the pastries and cake were good, but a little pricy compared to other Chinese bakeries. I'll definitely return to try some of their other pastries.", "author": "Andrea G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-15", "description": "Really cute little bakery, super bright and airy inside, with a pretty decent selection of Chinese baked goods. Perusing the shelves of pastries with a tray and tongs in hand reminded me of the way it's done in a panaderia picking out pan dulce. Premade sandwiches and delicious looking fruit cakes are at the front of the bakery, as well, and you can get boba drinks, too.\n\nI went with the pineapple bun, a mocha almond bun that looked pretty good, the BBQ pork pastry, and a chicken salad sandwich from the deli case. With a bottle of water my total came out to a little over $9. \n\nThe sandwich was really good, with a ton of fruit mixed in with the chicken, between a tasty raisin bread. The pineapple bun was good except for the crust, which was too hard, especially compared to ones I've had from other Chinese bakeries where everything was incredibly soft. The BBQ pork pastry I had mixed feelings about; there were way too many layers of pastry wrapped around the BBQ pork filling, so much so it stuck to the roof of your mouth and masked the flavor of the pork. And yet, when I managed to taste the pork, it was really good, and the pastry crust was very flaky and buttery, so it was a bit of a mixed bag. The almond mocha bun, however, wasn't that great, as it was a victim of total overkill with the mocha cream filling. Way too rich, and because the bun was so soft (a plus, at least) it didn't have a whole lot of substance and just became a big mess.\n\nI would definitely want to try the things I liked here again and come back to try some of those great looking cakes, get a boba, and taste some of the other baked goods, but I'm not so sure if it's worth a special trip from the East Bay. If I was in the area, then I'd come back, but for now I'll stick to the bakeries that are much closer.", "author": "Angela M."}

Their chocolate croissants and turnovers are also top notch. \nThe staff are always friendly and helpful. The prices are well marked and quite reasonable. While, for example, the pork buns here are $1.80 instead of more traditional dim sum bakeries which may sell for $0.75, the quality is more consistent. \nThe bakery does feel like a chain, which it is, but the quality makes it a good neighborhood staple.", "author": "Allxie C."}

Normal prices are a bit steep compared to the Asian bakeries back home.\n\nI took a fellow Yelper's advice and opted for the GREEN TEA MOCHI DANISH, $1.89 (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/At6Q1wPtUaKYQPGOqMjCgg/l.jpg). The pastry itself was familiarly flaky and chewy, lightly sweet and topped with almonds. The interesting part was the very sweet green tea mochi that had a strange tart apple flavor to it (http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/Im6v5CbnIrBRzPdSnvvCCQ/l.jpg). There was a small layer of milky white mochi, which I preferred. It took some time, but the pastry eventually grew on me.\n\nAlso, their special cakes will run between $18.95 - $23.95. A TIRAMISU CAKE is $19.95, $24.50 after tax. I believe all cakes comes with an optional free custom icing message written on a white chocolate piece. Oh, and if you can't commit to a huge cake, or are watching your waistline, small cake slices run between $1.99 - $3.19, with some tarts at $4.99.\n\nUPDATE (12/3/13):\n\nAt the end of the day, they may have BOGO free pastries by the cash register.

SLICK DEAL! If you ever suffered from an idiotic moment of ordering something extremely spicy, whether it is that dynamite sauce I had or extremely spicy curry down the street, milk product is your friend, and milk tea is a perfect example! I've had their almond milk tea, it's actually pretty good for a place whose forte is not milk tea. Their boba is free, and it's quite chewy. It wasn't too hard like undercooked nor too soft like overcooked. With the ham and egg 'wich? Just right for an afternoon tea or an early breakfast. I personally hate mayo, and the only downside is that there's a thick slab of mayo in the ham and egg sandwich. For $2.99, I'll live with it.\n\nI've had a few of their pastries other than the ham and egg 'wich.

They're alright, prettier than its actual taste. Perhaps they weren't fresh out of the oven when I bought them, and I didn't try them until an hour later. The strawberry falls easily, so be careful when you bite into it as you try to get a bit of custard, crust, and strawberry at once. The egg tart is mediocre like everywhere else.

Once I decided to stop in I can't seem to stop now.  Their selection is quite different than what I'm used to at their other San Francisco location a mere 11 blocks away.  Each time I've visited the new location something different has caught my eye to try.\n\nThe staff here is exceptionally friendly and helpful, and they don't bark at me like the older ladies at the other location do from time to time.  I love that the pastries purchased here are carefully packed into boxes.  In addition to some of the more traditional items like baked buns and cake rolls I've tried some not-so-common items also.  Of all the things I've tried there's probably just two items I would not purchase again.\n\nSo from savory to sweet and in no particular order here is a sampling of what I've tried so far:\n\nHam & Mushroom Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=41uDFZI1488oXwtF0JIMCg) - It's like a pizza baked on top of bun dough.  The tomato sauce is thin and tangy and the mushrooms are canned, but the two slices of deli ham were quite generous and in addition to the melty cheese I liked that there was a bit of crunch from strips of onion and green bell pepper within.  This was very good.\n\nHam & Corn Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=troabOP7XLoBm45pzWfmWQ) - The corn and ham topping was very skimpy on this unlike the ones I enjoy from my neighborhood Fancy Wheat Field Bakery.  I'd pass on these next time.\n\nHawaiian Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=LJ3ILnNSCeyPcWuxpvRKNg) - If you like Hawaiian pizza chances are you'll like this bun also.  There's no tomato sauce on this, but the generous amount of corn kernels, chopped ham and pineapple pieces all held together by melty cheese is a party in your mouth just waiting to happen.  I only like Hawaiian pizza, but I loved this!\n\nCheese & Jalapeno French Bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=YdJFJz15TfvNOQbj-SrfDA) - The version at Andersen Bakeries is many times better.  The cheese inside the bun was quite generous, but they added a ridiculous amount of salt that simply overpowered both the cheese and the jalapeno.  That's tough to do, but they succeeded.  Blah!!\n\nBlueberry Pound Cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=_qwkm2KkHmFHorVfhWdaWQ) - The cake is dense and moist and not very sweet either.  The amount of blueberries within the loaf was very generous.\n\nPuff Pastry Custard Bun (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=fuDk9XL9Q-ba3oUhPQFzAw) - Find a friend and share this with because the puff pastry and the generous amount of custard inside is definitely on the oily and rich side.  I lightly toasted it to make the puff pastry shell crispy.  Could that have been my shortfall?  Had it not been so rich I would have liked it a lot more.\n\nApple Flan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TNRY8SId9WzIhRNbodDehA?select=jpNvuo4hJPq32bp5OeLXGA) - I heated this up and served it with some homemade cherry and bourbon ice cream that a good friend passed along.  The flan part could be better both in flavor and consistency.  It was definitely on the gritty side.  I did enjoy the soft, tart apple slices which may have saved this flan.  Great that it's not overly sweet.\n\nSo my four stars may appear a bit generous, but they're new and still getting some of their kinks out.  In my future I see myself visiting this location a lot more often than the original location.  A super clean shop and the friendly atmosphere count for something too.  I can't wait to discover more deliciousness on my next visit!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Because I just went to Lisbon last year, and the big treat to buy there is the pastel de nata outside of Jeronimos Monastery in the Belem area. It's similar to the tarts you get at Golden Gate Bakery except the top is browned. Good to know I can find them here since I was popping those in my mouth in Lisbon like nobody's business. The other item I bought was a $2.25 Turkey Sandwich which they put between slices of their extra soft white bread (see photo). It was fine the day after when I brought it to work for lunch. So was the tart. I could use a Sheng Kee Bakery closer to my home but alas, it's good to know it's around.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...nice eats and treats immaculately presented\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...organized and calm with plenty of pickings\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...very quiet and deferential\nTOTAL - 3 stars...definitely worth a stop in the area if you need a little something in your stomach", "author": "Ed U."}

I should really just go to bakeries early, because there is really nothing like a freshly baked green tea mochi danish. The texture difference is huge. I also picked up a tuna and corn danish for tea later on, which I just ate. Oh man. So good. The tuna didn't have mayo, which is a plus for me and my allergies, and it went really well with my tea here at home. This Sheng Kee location had WAY more things than the one back in Pacifica. Fried fish sandwiches?!!!! Noms.\n\nThe service was friendly and quick. The woman behind the cash register asked if I'd like my breads packed separately, since I had some savories and some sweets, and that was a small act I appreciated. I like that they had some tea selections as well. The oolong creama was surprisingly good in that the oolong taste was quite strong.\n\nI'd definitely go back.

My favorite to eat plain or with jam!\n- Hot dog buns: You would never think to get hot dog buns at a Chinese bakery, but it's really not bad from here. \n- Vanilla cake with fruit filling is the best choice, skip the mousse cakes. You can count on them to not make it overly sweet and the cream is like a whipped cream. \n- There is seating and tables here as well as drink offerings. \n\nImprovements\n- Pastry items don't look to fresh at this location compared to what I've gotten in the South Bay locations and some are on the verge of being burnt or on the dry side. Maybe it's because they don't individually package each bun in plastic bags, but it does save the environment!\n- If you decide to get a chocolate cake, don't count on it being rich and chocolatey like American chocolate cakes. Think hint of chocolate like cocoa powdered cake instead. \n\nTip\n- Parking is difficult here, take public transit or good luck finding metered or street parking nearby.", "author": "Tracy T."}

I really like their chicken pot pies.  They're a pastry puff shell filled with thickened gravy with chunks of chicken (some days more chicken than others), a little too salty but satisfying.

The cakes were fantastic: the pastry shell was firm yet soft, crumbly and buttery, and the paste had the perfect amount of fresh pineapple and sugar. The cheesecake was not very good--too spongey, too much like Japanese cheesecake (which is a whole other texture).\n\nService wasn't bad.

My friend and I came here for a small snack and they had a wide variety of items to choose from. I had myself a hot dog and cheese bun and I thought it was excellent, and at $1.19 a great value, too. My friend had a ham and mushroom bun and she seemed to enjoy her pastry as well. The service was quick and friendly and the interior was clean and well lit. Many seats and tables are available in the back for customers who choose to stay and enjoy their food. The music was quite loud when we were there so it was not the best environment for conversation. Bonus points for having a restroom for customers and for being open until 10pm. I look forward to trying more of their products whenever I am in the area.

(Don't worry Arizmendi, I still love you). \n\nSheng Kee has decent price pastries topped with yummy goodness. I like the mushroom, cheese, and ham bread. The dangerous cheesy pineapple, corn, and ham danish isn't bad either. The first time I had it was great, the second time however, the corn tasted a bit stale. I'm not too big of a fan of their buns with green onions and hot dogs. The hot dogs were way too salty. However, for a small tuna sandwich for less than $2, you can't really beat that. \n\nI've always enjoyed it to go, but I hope to one day take advantage of the back patio they have.", "author": "Mandy D."}

It's not on the Chinesefied part of Irving (past 19th Ave), and thus can get away with a difference in quality, that is good enough to appeal to non Chinese clientele who might not be able to tell what a good authentic Hong Kong style pineapple bun should taste like, or care that the pork floss bun looks more lke a chia pet on a bun, but will gladly eat a hot dog cheese bun and think it's the best thing in the world.\n\nThe Macau/Portguese style egg tart did look slightly better than the kind from the San Mateo branch, but structural integrity was quite poor as the egg custard made the bottom part of the crust so moist that it crumbled on the tin it rested on (and thus made the experience less interesting), and thus leaving one's fingers deep in greaseville trying to put it in one's mouth. At virtually $1.35 per, not a cheap endeavor (especially a messy and not so great one)....have to give the tip of the hat to Sogo Bakery (Burlingame) for their even better and more refined rendition. Given the lackluster execution, not holding up hopes for the regular Cantonese style egg tarts (which makes me wonder where Hongry Kong Truck got their receipe).\n\nNot a huge fan otherwise of this branch's Sheng Kee offerings, even based on visual inspection of the remaining selection. The pineapple buns don't look right (they need to be big round at the very least, and BOLD....Kee Wah makes a definitive version with a secret crispy texture). The \"Taiwanese\" side of things don't seem very Taiwanese at all (look at Sogo Burlingame, or 85 C in Irvine, or JJ's in Arcadia, Irvine  for their versatility etc). So the conclusion is that it's an ok Asian bakery, but not Hong Kong or Taiwanese enough in terms of standards.\n\nAs much as I enjoy the decor (it's generally better looking than most other Sheng Kee locations) and appreciate the fact that they sell tapioca milk tea like drinks in attempt to be different from the others (although very likely executed to a standard nowhere close to my liking), perhaps investing more into bread and pastry and bun quality, and making/baking techniques...stealing ideas from Japanese bakeries yet adding a classic European twist, would easily make this location a much superior branch than others.

The pineapple buns are pretty good when they're fresh: flaky sweet crust on top of a light and airy bun. I can't confirm whether they're called pineapple buns because they look like pineapples or because they have a pineapple flavor. Pretty sure it's the first one. I'm a sucker for the hot dog buns too, but man, the hot dogs they bake into those things are so dried out and artificial, I'd be interested to know how much of it is actually meat. They have some good cakes, though. Their fruit tart was very good, and they also have a chocolate/cream cheese thing they sell by the register that kind of looks like a cream cheese brownie, which was really good. \n\nThey have a few tables and seats at this place, so you can hang out and really enjoy those buns you just bought.

If you are a broke-ass grad student, trying to find good deals in the area, then you can't go wrong with this; they have weekly specials ranging from 99cent boba drinks to $3 pastries with a free boba drink. They have those specials every week so there is always a good deal every time you enter the bakery. \n\nBesides hakuna matata, my motto is quality over quantity. They have a great variety and quantity of pastries, which is great but quality control is the main issue. Some of their pastries are too sweet and soggy. I'm a sweet tooth and that's saying something! Ironically, the boba drinks might be on the bland side so always ask the cashier about your sweetness preference.

Of course I would be even poorer since they have a LOT of food stuff! I had also gone into another bakery on 9th, don't remember the name, but their items were your average muffins, donuts, etc. BORING. This bakery has a lot of other exciting things like custard pies, fruit sticks.. oh geesh I don't even remember their names because I remember by the way they look.. and they looked GOOD haha. I did buy two custard pies.. um Armani pie or sumthin? Another one with blueberry. I got pineapple stick. A strawberry custard bun. And some special cookies with red bean inside. So I didn't eat any of them there.. but dude I pigged out at home for dinner! O.M.G! Everything was soo sooo good. I wanna live next to this bakery waah I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Vol T."}

Prices are super-reasonable - massive cupcakes and generous cake slices for $1.95.  On the other hand, you get what you pay for.  Tried the pineapple raisin cream bun, which had a hollow interior lined with a strange sugary paste and a smattering of raisins, as well as slice of mango cake, which was refreshing but not as airy as similar variants from higher-end bakeries.", "author": "Jeremy C."}

I bought a Portuguese custard because the other ones looked burned and gross.  I also bought an apple tart and I should have not purchased it because it was really heavy to pick up with the tongs, and that should have been an indication that it was not the tasty dessert I was planning on having.  The Portuguese custard was okay, but it was missing some sweetness.  Maybe that's what makes it different than regular custard; I don't know.  When I went to the counter to pay, the lady who works there had just touched the trash can because it fell.  Then she touched the money.  Then she touched my pastries and threw them into a paper bag when I said I wanted them to go.  She didn't even bother to put them into separate bags like they do at the other Sheng Kee Bakery and the apple tart was kind of crushed.  I also wasn't thrilled that they were touching each other in the bag.  Her rudeness on top of the burned custard warrants this place two stars.", "author": "k h."}
