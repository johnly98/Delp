Since they no longer make wedding cakes, we ordered our tiered cake elsewhere, and in order to feed our 350 guest count, we supplemented by ordering several sheet cakes from Schubert's. After trying at least five different individual mini cakes, we decided that we liked the double chocolate mousse the best - white and chocolate sponge with white and dark chocolate mousse, whipped cream and chocolate shavings. Doesn't that even SOUND dreamy?? \n\nOn the day of the wedding, pick-up by one of our groomsmen was smooth and the cakes looked beautiful (even though nobody would know since they were cut up in the back). Some of our guests commented that this sheet cake tasted even better than our fancy tiered cake! Because we had ordered enough for every guest to have at least one slice, and also had a dessert bar, we did have some left over, much to my great great delight. The day after the wedding, I sat in bed eating this delicious cake at 1am and it was glorious. I've eaten a slice every day since then and I have no regrets - wedding diet is over, baby! \n\nBut really, the double chocolate mousse is amazing and I would definitely recommend it! Ending this review here so that I can walk to the kitchen and fulfill my cake quota for today..", "author": "Nicole M."}

It's obvious why this cake is the store's signature cake: the yellow shell is actually a ice-cream like shell, that looks amazing because unlike other cakes, it is smooth and round, like a perfect egg. The shell is not just for show either--it tastes really good, like a kind of ice-cream that doesn't melt at room-temperature. Inside the shell is a cake with cherry jelly and cream. Overall the Princess cake tastes just right--sweet, but not too sweet. Soft, but not too soft. It reminds me of those Swedish cookies everyone ate when we were kids--it's not extreme in any trait (sweetness, fruitiness etc), but when everything is put together, it feels balanced. Like bottle of water when you are thirsty. The cake tastes just right. Balanced. Normal. Right. You just keep shoveling it into your mouth and not even notice.\n\nThe store itself is really nice too. Inside, you can see a brightly lit room with lots of cake and pastries on display. The entire shop is sparkling clean, with the floor and walls reflecting light :) The folks who work there are all very friendly, and greet you nicely. We ordered a cake in advance online, which is nice because they let you put custom messages on the cake, and also pay online so you can get everything done without showing up in person. Really convenient.\n\nWe came here before to buy a cup of coffee as well, and it tasted pretty good. The folks on staff then was different, but equally nice and courteous.\n\nOverall, a great place to go get birthday cakes. They will take care of you.", "author": "Henry L."}

The shop is somewhat small and often times crowded (especially during the holidays) but if you get a chance you should definitely stop by and try a slice (or several slices) of their amazing cakes. I have tried several different cakes and I honestly love them all! \n\nI first had the opera cake and immediately fell in love with the hazelnut and chocolate flavor! (I'm a certified nutella lover). Some may say that the opera cake is too rich but that's honestly the way I like my cakes so it was perfect for me! The St. Honore Cake with it's cream puffs and lady fingers is also a nice option if you want something a bit less sweet but still celebratory and decadent! But my favorite cake of all time would have to be the Swedish Princess Cake.....I'm drooling just thinking about it. \n\nI find it to be a perfect blend of sweet and tart because of the smooth sweetness of the marzipan and the tartness of the raspberry filling. The white cake layers keep the base of the cake nice and simple, letting the other components (marzipan, raspberry and custard filling) shine. I ask for this cake whenever I am celebrating ANYTHING in San Francisco. I've had it for several birthdays and even my college graduation and I'm just getting going!", "author": "Coleen J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-10-30", "description": "I searched the internet high and low to find a bakery to order my mom's favorite, a Black Forest cake, for her birthday. I finally decided to chose Schubert's this time because it was nearby and it seemed to get good reviews on its other cakes. I was a bit hesitant, however, because one review of the Black Forrest cake was pretty dismal. I felt that I should try it myself. I regret my decision. My reason is not so much the flavor of the cake (although it wasn't anything to write home about), but moreover the size and height of the cake for the cost. The cake is a standard round cake, around 8 inches, but the height of this cake is only 2 inches! The cost is $36.00, which is pricey for a cake that is only 2 inches tall. Some other reviews have described Schubert's cakes as being the texture of the less expensive Asian cakes that are sold throughout the neighborhood. I agree with these comments. The texture of the cake is light and the chocolate flavor is weak, like many of the Asian cakes that I frequently buy. I, like many people, enjoy the light, airy, and less expensive cakes sold at Asian bakeries. But that's not what I go to a European bakery for. Black Forrest cakes should be chocolatey and have a texture like a European cake. The whipped cream was real and tasty, and the cherry pur\u00e9e wasn't too bad, although I would have liked it to be sweeter. But the height of this cake is not acceptable and this is where Schubert's can't compete with other European bakeries in San Francisco. If you are planning a party where your cake is the centerpiece of the dessert table, don't chose Schubert's because you will be disappointed. If the flavors were exceptional, I might overlook the size. But this is not the case. My guests suggested that I try Safeway's Black Forrest cake, so I bought one the other day. It was half the price! It was tall, had real whipped cream, tasty cherries, and I was pleasantly surprised.  I have heard good things about Ambrosia bakery, so I plan on trying out their Black Forrest cake. Schubert's should increase the height of their cake by at least 2 inches to compete with the other European bakeries. It would also help if they change the batter of the chocolate cake so that it isn't so bland.", "author": "Kathy R."}

So much color and beautiful pastries, cakes on display. They definitely know how to make their products look appetizing.\n\nService: When it was busy, the employees would ask if they could help the next person. When it slowed down, I walked up to the register and awkwardly stood there for 2 minutes or so waiting for someone to approach me. I don't know what the standard etiquette is for bakeries, but if you're in front of the cash register with you wallet out and trying to make eye contact, you'd think they would say something. In the end, I just asked if someone could help me. So don't wait, just ask. \n\nFood: My sister and I shared a fruit tart because I wanted something somewhat healthy looking. I really enjoyed this tart because it was on the sweeter side. The fruits were all sweet and tasty too! The best part was that I didn't feel guilty eating it. I would recommend it!\n\nOverall, definitely worth a visit! I would go back for more when I visit SF again.", "author": "Helen H."}

I've ordered multiple cakes from them because they are consistently delicious, beautiful, and moist. \nEarlier this week, I ordered a sheet cake on their website for a baby shower at work. My coworker picked it up today and it didnt have any writing on it. I called the bakery to see what happened because it looked so bare. The older asian lady that I initially spoke with was rude and unhelpful, but luckily she handed me off to the owner of the bakery. He was such a gentleman. He offered to come to the office and write on the cake. A couple hours later, he showed up with everything needed to decorate the cake (and even added some baby decorations). Not only did he make the cake look perfect just in time for the party, he brought us a box of cookies for the inconvenience. He explained that they were planning on updating their website soon and apologized for the mixup. \nThough the missing cake message and rude woman on the phone would normally be a reason I'd lower the rating, the customer service and every other cake I've gotten from them more than make up for it.

My family and I ordered their princess cake for our relative's birthday. It looked very beautiful and different from other cakes I've seen, in that it has a firm yellow layer on the outside. The cake itself was good -- the inside had layers of sponge cake with some whipped cream and raspberry sandwiched in between. Raspberry was a very unique flavor that went very well with the sweetness of the cake However, the outer yellow marzipan layer was, in my opinion, not that good -- it was way too sweet and didn't mesh well with the softness of the cake.\n\nIf I were to go back, I would definitely try one of the other options.", "author": "Alvin W."}

This is a destination worthy food and I'd highlight as a worthwhile detour for out of town guests. \n\nThe slices go for about $4, but I recommend ordering a whole cake as it's quite a bit less costly per serving (at $35 for the smallest size) and let  me tell you, you're going to want seconds, thirds and maybe eighths. To ensure they don't sell out on you, I recommend ordering the cake online ahead of time; usually a day or two in advance is sufficient. \n\nThe only real negative is that this cake does not keep well, so be sure to invite some friends to enjoy with you that first day!", "author": "Stephanie T."}

I was confused about what to get as soon as I walked in because everything looked so good! There were cakes, cheesecakes, mousse, eclairs, etc. You basically peruse the display case and then place your order.\n\nI am a chocolate fiend so I had to try the chocolate truffle cake. I also really wanted to try the swedish princess cake since it seemed to be a crowd favorite. Oh my god, can we talk about the Swedish Princess Cake? It was absolutely delicious. Light, creamy, and flavorful without being to sweet. The fondant on top was not my favorite, but hey the rest of the cake was extremely good. The chocolate truffle cake was also quite good! Very rich, but not overly sweet. I think the swedish princess cake just became my favorite cake flavor ever. It was a complete delight to eat and I regretted not getting more of it.\n\nSeating is limited (~3 tables with maye 3-4 chairs each) so you'll most likely have to take the cake to go unless you come in when there isn't much of a crowd.

I've been to Schubert's several times before and their cakes and pastries are good, but just not that good. I'd say quality and taste is comparable to Cocola bakery. Their sponge cakes have an artificial taste and too weak to hold up to the moisture of mousses and jams. I got the tiramisu mini cake last week and it lacked coffee or any depth of flavor. The quality of the chocolate flakes they use is also sub-par. I will say their Napoleon pastries and cakes are their better products.

And please don't let challenging parking turn you away. Park a few blocks away from Clement for a few quarters or for free; it's really not bad.\n\nTheir bakery cases are such a beautiful sight with all the colorful cakes and other desserts. Unlike other bakeries, they are well stocked too. We've come several times in the afternoon and luckily they were full.\n\nBoth the Swedish Princess Cake and the Mousse Cakes were recommended so we got those. The mousse on the Mango Mousse Cake had a nice flavor and texture, but the bottom cake part was dry. Both the Chocolate Mousse Cake and the slide of Swedish Princess Cake on the other hand were fantastic, and I'm not a cake person.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with Swedish Princess Cake, their variety is layers of white cake with raspberry and kirsch custard filling, whipped cream and marzipan icing. The cake was nice and fluffy, and went well with all the other layers. I love that you can buy it by the slice too, without committing to an entire cake.

Both are customer favorites and highly recommended by the bakery itself. One thing to note about the Mango Mouse Cake is that the cake is 80-90% mousse and only 10% of cake, so if you're looking for something more traditional in terms of cake to non-cake ratio, I would opt for the Black Forest Cake. I've also tried their famous Princess cake, but the marzipan covering was a bit too sweet for me, so if prefer less sweet desserts, I would definitely opt for the tangy mousse cakes.\n\nDo beware what some of the other Yelpers have said about dry cake! There ARE dry cakes, and this seems to mostly happen with some of the individual, small cakes they have on display that may have been sitting there for days.

I tried calling multiple times to push back the pick up time but I guess they don't answer the phones on Saturdays. When we arrived to the bakery at 1:30ish, we were in and out in less than 5 mins. No hassle for coming late, just a big smile and a pretty interesting looking cake. \n\nOk into how it tasted. IT WAS DELICIOUS!

The pastry underneath was flaky and super crunchy, and the fresh fruit on the top made it look beautiful and added some much-appreciated freshness to the cake.

I think my 10th birthday cake came out with this neon green exterior and the oddest texture but once you got past it (marzipan), there was a delicious fluffy sponge cake and mysterious red fruit jam layer (because I was too unsophisticated to tell the difference between my tart berries). It was the Swedish princess cake! Since then I can't really handle more than a slice at a time, but it's still amazing and the highlight of their shop! \n\nSome other things I've tried (small slices/desserts $4-5): \n+ tiramisu is one of their best with the fluffiest lady fingers, not too sweet, and not overpowering in any way but a perfect balance of coffee and cream. \n\n+ mango mousse is not a favourite because the base/surrounding sponge cake has such a hard texture that is too stark in contrast with the lightness mango filling. I wish the mango flavour came out a tad bit more to give it that oomph and tang. \n\n+op\u00e9ra cake (not pictured) is also just not my cup of tea. The chocolate is certainly well done, and a touch of it is on all the cakes-- tiny Schubert bakery written on a piece of white chocolate and beautiful milk chocolate flowers. But the opera cake is sorta like a torte.. the hard textured layers just have not balance with any mouse or cream. \n\n+mysterious summer seasonal cake: it was surrounded with their awesome chocolate ganache with layers of white and chocolate cake and raspberry layer, it was bomb and I recommend trying it if you see it in the pastry box! \n\nAt the end of writing this, there are equal amounts of dislikes and likes but schuberts is one of those bakeries that does it all and does it well enough that anyone with any preference can find something they like! \n\nP.s.

We froze the top layer and for our one year anniversary had the last of the cake.  It was not as wonderful as when fresh but still flavorful.  We moved away from the SF Bay and once a year on our anniversary we would take the Amtrak train and head to Schubert's for a piece of the rich cake.  Through the years we have moved farther east and searched for a cake similar to the Schubert's opera cake, to no avail.  Our anniversary was this week and my husband's request was to eat a slice of Schubert's Opera Cake!", "author": "Karen S."}

With that said, it blew my mind that I have yet to leave my obligatory 5 star review for Schubert's. I've been here so many times that I can't even count. Even when I was a kid my parents would take me here. \n\nThis morning I stopped by for a danish with vanilla filling in the middle, and as usual, it was fantastic. I'm a big pastry guy, and I don't take it lightly when I say they have arguably the best danish in the city. For just under $3, it's absolutely worth the price considering how large it is, just tasty and perfect. Another underrated thing about Schubert's is that they serve Equator Coffee - a coffee chain based out of Marin - and it's one of the best. For 2 large danishes and 2 coffees, it's just under $10. Very reasonable for high quality coffee and pastry. All in all, this is one of my go to breakfast sports and if you're in need of a birthday cake, they have one of the best selections of cake in all of the city, and their reputation (1,400+ reviews and 4 1/2 stars) speaks for itself.

I called Schubert's at 10am on a weekday, asked how long it would take to get a birthday cake with a personalized message on it. They said, 30 minutes and it will be ready! And it was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-29", "description": "I've purchased quite a few cakes here over the years, mostly for family get-togethers. I was surprised to find out this is a 100+ year-old German bakery. To me, it has a lot of the telltale signs of a typical Asian bakery with mousse-y cakes and lots of fruit topping. Maybe the neighborhood changed over the years and they added a few things to accommodate their clientele? But then I remind myself that Princess Cake, Opera Cake, Tiramisu, etc. are not Asian. Duh. Sometimes I forget, because it seems like many Asian-owned cake shops crank out some version of these cakes.\n\nCakes here are heavily decorated with glazes, fruits, chocolate flowers, chocolate shavings, etc. Most of the time, there isn't room on the cake to write 'Happy Birthday' or whatever occasion you're celebrating. So they usually write it on a white chocolate square, which is a little too sweet and not too pretty.\n\nSwedish Princess Cake - not for me. I'm not a fan of marzipan or marzipan icing. It is good for decorative purpose and gives a smooth finish, but it has a gummy consistency, like fondant.\nThe filling is moist, but I just don't like the flavor of kirsch, or cherry liqueur.\n\nChocolate Mousse w/ Whipped Cream - moist inside, lots of whipped cream & chocolate shavings, topped with a few raspberries\nChocolate Mousse w/ Almonds - very chocolate-y with chocolate mousse filling & chocolate ganache, crunchy toasted almonds are a nice contrast\n\nWhite Chocolate Raspberry Mousse - extra mousse-y with white chocolate mousse & raspberry mousse, topped with raspberry coulis and ladyfingers\n\nSt. Honore - lots of whipped cream, has layers of puff pastry, topped with cream puffs and lady fingers. The cream puffs are okay, could be lighter.\n\nTiramisu Mousse - sweet, moist, pretty light. Indistinguishable from a typical tiramisu with cocoa powder and ladyfingers. These are covered in chocolate shavings and more flower-shaped chocolates. The chocolate rectangles on the border are good, but kind of a pain because you have to remove all the chocolates to be able to slice the cake. By the time everyone has had some cake and some of the chocolates on top of the cake, nobody is interested in eating the chocolate squares.\n\nIt's a small bakery with a couple of tables for dining in. Cakes are about $30-$40 for an 8-10 inch. Service is usually more about efficiency than about being inviting, but that is understandable when it gets crowded, especially around closing time.\n\nThe cakes are good, but not my favorite as I don't love a lot of mousse or whipped cream. It's not my first choice for cake or for satisfying a sweet tooth. But it is a good option for birthdays or some other occasion when people get together to eat cake and be merry.", "author": "Joy W."}

Now some people add several layers of cherries. Some do one layer. Some put cherries on top, too. Some don't. \n\nRegardless, the one thing no one (who claims to know anything about black forest cake) does is create an entire, thick layer of what seemed to be a fruit jam you'd get in a can when living in a war zone. Consistency like the cranberry sauce you get in a can. \n\nJust think about that for a moment.\n\nNo cherries in the cake. None. Just one cherry on top of the slice. A good one, though. Imagine those in the cake. That would be heavenly, because the cake was good. The cream wasn't the best, but good enough. With cherries in there, this could be 3.5 (4, if feeling generous) stars instead of one. But I had to toss half my slice. The bottom half. The half that made me feel like I was back in a war zone.\n\nI think they *used* to do cherries years ago; I saw a Yelp photo that looked like it. Who knows why they stopped.

Not to say it doesn't taste delicious because it really is so good. \n\n1) Chocolate Mousse with Ganache shavings: CHOCOLATE HEAVEN MMMMM \n\n2) Mango Mousse (family ate it before I could get a picture LOL): the fruit mousses here are aammmaazziingg! Perfect balance. Not too sweet, not too sour, super moist and soft cake, worth every penny. \n\nPARKING: street, metered (or park a little further and there are also unmetered spots, 2 hours).

I remembered, fondly, when I first discovered this delicacy, it was with my then Telegraph Hill boyfriend, who took me to Tiburon or Sausalito on some date from circa 1998. We also had our last meal there after we'd broken up. Teary and puppy eyed while taking small bits of princess cake. So very not princess like. Strangely enough, while in Sweden over the last few years, I've yet to find one good bakery that made good princess cakes. \n\nIt was raining. Pouring rain in the summer. Who ordered the rain? Did I bring it back from London? We ducked in for a much needed coffee. It's raining in July for god's sake. Someone needs coffee to wake her up from this wet dream alright.\n\nHurriedly scanning Yelp reviews for must haves. Bingo. Princess cake is on the top of the list. Mind you, this is NOT my neighborhood. And I've NOT had princess cake for eons. \n\nHe said, \"Princess cake for a princess.\" \n\nI said, \"Where?\" \n\nOrdered cakes, pastries, and a cup of coffee to go. It was exceptionally warm and smooth. No hint of cherries or strawberries or chocolate, it's not necessarily organic / hand grind / pour over stuff, but it's perfectly acceptable just the way it is. It kept two very wet, under dressed pedestrians warm, and dry (inside). \n\nAND I learned something new yet again. \n\nPrincess cake is made best here, not across the bay; coffee is best served super hot on a raining day; and stranger than fiction things do happen: we got rain in July.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Much like Green Apple across the way and Toy Boat down the street, this classic, European bakery is practically an institution on this part of Clement.   \n\nWhile they offer a variety of delicious pies, tarts, pastries, and cookies to choose from, desserts are the name of the game here.  Or, more specifically, cakes.  There are a few that stand out, like the Mango Mousse and Tiramisu, but the one that they're probably best known for is their SWEDISH PRINCESS CAKE.\n\nAlthough I'm not fanatical when it comes to cakes, I will say that this is one tasty treat.  Between this and Swedish pancakes, it's clear those Swedes know their confections!  The cake itself is rather light and airy, but what's most impressive is how well the custard, raspberry, and whipped cream come together.  Not only are the fruitiness and creaminess balanced, but the taste isn't overly sweet either (except, perhaps, for the fondant, which has a strong almond flavor).\n\nIf you are planning on picking up a dessert from Schubert's for a special occasion, it's definitely recommended to call ahead and reserve one, especially around the holidays and Valentine's.  The line here may not be as bad as other places in SF, but there's a steady flow of customers throughout the day, so it's not uncommon for the more popular items to sell out.\n\nFOUR AND A HALF STARS rounded down, but not for anything Schubert's has done wrong or for their service (all of the workers are pretty friendly).  Rather, as I mentioned, I'm just not big on cakes, so some of the amazement and wonder is lost on me (nor am I a princess).  However, it shouldn't stop you from checking out this neighborhood gem.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-07", "description": "I heard so many good things about Schubert's Bakery, so I made a specific trip to Clement Street to find out what all the hype was about. Schubert's Bakery is located between 6th and 7th Avenue, with a good number of street parking. There are a various number of restaurants and stores around the bakery, so parking can get tough if you come during a busy time. \n\nI had already poured through the many pictures of the various cakes from Schubert's, so I came with the intention of trying the popular Swedish Princess Cake and the Fruit Tart. Because the cakes look so pretty in the photos, I had expected the bakery to be just as fancy. I was actually a bit surprised at how small and low-key the bakery really is. Walking in, if I didn't know how popular Schubert's Bakery is, I probably wouldn't have expected too much from the store. The bakery in itself is quite old, with a few tables inside the restaurant, signs on the wall that explain the popular menu items, and big refrigerator display cases of cakes and other treats. I think I expected more of a Porto's or Tartine's type bakery, but there is something pretty comforting and unique about how low key everything is - you know they put a lot of time and effort into their food. \n\nI really wanted to try the fruit tart, but sadly they were all out. I only was able to try a slice of the Princess Cake, which set me back about $4-$5. Kind of pricey for a simple slice of cake. It was put into a plain box, and I was quickly on my way. The cake in itself is quite fancy looking. There are layers of sponge cake with raspberry and custard filling. The cake itself is wrapped in marzipan with simple decorations adorned on top. If you're gentle enough, you can pull the marzipan layer off of the cake. Eating the marzipan, sponge cake, and the fillings altogether allow you to get a complete taste of the cake. I personally really enjoyed the marzipan because it has a unique almond flavor. The cake is light and springy and because the custard and raspberry fillings aren't too tart or sweet, they provide the perfect complement to the cake and marzipan. It's definitely a delicious cake, but I feel that even one slice was too much for me and I had to eat it in several visits. I can only imagine eating the whole cake! \n\ntl;dr - Swedish Princess Cake was pretty good and worth a try if you're in the area, but it's not something I would go out of my way for. It's a bit pricey and a little on the heavy side. I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it, but I would probably return to Schubert's to try out the fruit tart next time or one of the other various cakes.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Why did you get rid of that and yet kept that awful sour black currant cake - which, by the way, is always on the discount shelf?!?!?!  Totally does not make sense but ok whatever we sucked it up and moved on.\n\nSo we order the 8\" raspberry mousse.  First of all the decorations were missing.  No chocolate pieces on top.  No white scroll decoration either.  It was just a plain mouse jello top with unglazed raspberries.  The raspberries look like they were dying a slow death.\n\nThe cake looked underdone.  Also where' the second layer?  In the past, you get 2 layers of cake sandwiched with mousse. Now you get a layer of cake and a big fat layer of mousse.  WTF!\n\nThis cake costs almost $30.  For that price I want it to look just like it did in the past.  This is unacceptable and they just lost a customer.", "author": "Wendy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-14", "description": "It's my BFF's birthday today, and if she were here, I would get her a cake from Schubert's.\n\nBut she's not here anymore because she moved down to SoCal a couple of years ago. Nowadays when we talk on the phone, I always picture her in sunglasses, on the account of SoCal always being hot and all. And if I were to mail her a cake, which I won't, I imagine the cake would reflect off the lens of her shades as she goes in for a bite. I reckon that'll make a pretty good birthday picture.\n\nMaybe I should mail her a cake. But I probably won't. Not because I'm not a good friend, because I am, but because it just doesn't make sense to mail her a cake. You see, Schubert's most popular cake would be their Princess Cake, and that's the one I'll mail to her if I were to mail her one. The Princess Cake not only tastes real good, and it does taste real good with its multi-layers of flavor and its subtle taste of raspberry. But also, the cake itself is quite a looker, too. It's covered in a thin layer of bright green candy frosting, and really, the whole thing looks like a powdery green snowball. It's a beauty. And when something is a beauty like that, you can't just go off and trust that USPS will mail it unharm. The whole cake might be destroyed by the time it gets to SoCal. I bet it would still be delicious, though, and the cake itself would still be pretty fluffy. But sometimes when something doesn't look the way it's supposed to, you go and think that it doesn't taste as good. It probably still tastes exactly the same, but you would be totally convinced that it tastes different just because it looks different. And maybe my bff would think that way too when USPS shows up to her front door with a damaged Princess Cake. That's the real reason why I won't mail her the cake. \n\nMaybe I'll just go with her to Schubert's next time she comes home. And instead of buying a whole cake, we would just buy a slice of the Princess Cake. You can do that at Schubert's, just buy one slice of a cake that you like. And I'll get their Chocolate Mousse with Almonds, so that way, my bff can taste two cakes instead of just one. But she'll want to take the first bite first, on the account of her being a germo-phobe, so she'll probably get the raspberry on top. I guess that's okay, since it's her birthday and all.\n\nAnd I can be there to help her take her belated birthday picture, with the cake reflecting off the lens of her sunglasses. Unless she wears those polarized ones, then I guess all you can see are her eyes. Or she may not even be wearing sunglasses since she'll be in the San Francisco fog once she comes back. But I guess we can still take a picture at Schubert's. It won't be the way I imagine it, but I bet it'll still end up being a good picture. We'll make it work, we usually make things work. I guess that's why we're best buddies. \n\nHappy Birthday, Lisa :) 8/15/16", "author": "Ringo M."}

I had such high hopes for Schubert's after going on Yelp & seeing that it had close to 5 stars and over 1000 reviews. \n\nNeedless to say, I was severely disappointed at the quality & taste of the cakes. My sister & I got the strawberry mousse cake & tiramisu to share and we couldn't even finish them completely. \n\nThe layer of jam on the strawberry mousse was far too sour & the actual strawberry topping was coated with such a thick layer of sweet jam that it didn't even taste like fruit anymore. The bottom chiffon layer of the mousse cake was OK but on the dry side. The actual mousse part was good but coupled with the overly sour top layer & the dry bottom layer, the cake itself was mediocre at best ):\nhttp://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/G4SlNMfV-yziv7wNRbbagg/l.jpg\n\nThe tiramisu was ok & definitely better than the strawberry mousse. It was loaded with a ton of whipped cream on top & again it tasted more like your standard chiffon cake. I didn't taste any mascarpone which is a pretty crucial ingredient for tiramisus. Almost tasted like tiramisu you could buy from Safeway. http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/3FmGHlnc4rtmLJPzZ5kfgQ/l.jpg\n\n\nI believe each slice of cake was $3.95 which I think is pretty standard for specialty cake shops so I didn't think much of it however after having tasted the cakes, its definitely not worth the price.\n\nMaybe I went on a bad day or maybe I should try their pastries next time?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-30", "description": "In one word: awful!\nNow let me elaborate: I've been buying cakes at Schubert's for about 25 years; not too often: 2-3 times per year. It used to be so good! I heard they changed the ownership (i wouldln't care) and also the cake baker (makes all the difference!). Schubert's was never 'cheap' but I always found their prices to be justified because of the high quality of their cakes. This time I opted for Black Forrest. Their average-sized cake that would feed (per their estimate) 8-12 people is $35.95.  Not cheap. But again, when you want a good cake, you are willing to pay.  First of all, this cake is about 2/3 of the height of the old Black Forrest they used to make. They still use the tall large box, so it's a bit of an optical illusion when you prepay and just pick up that nice large box.  The old Black Forrest had moist porous tall 2 layers of cake with whipped cream and fresh strawberries in between and on top.   This one had two thin spongy cake layers (similar to cakes from lots of Asian bakeries in the area) that had no distinct flavor whatsoever.  It also had NO berries in-between; there was some sour concoction in place of berries that looked and tasted like sour mashed up and pressed together jam. Then they put some cherries on top: I have no clue what they've done to those cherries, but they were very bitter and tasted like they were soaked in some cheap alcohol. Everyone who tried it, had to spit it out. The only 'normal' thing about that cake was whipped cream. Would you pay $35.95 for about 1/2 lb of whipped cream?! My husband, who I have yet to see not to finish a slice of cake in 30 years we've been married (let alone a cake from Schubert's), ate top half and then said that he simply can't eat the bottom part (including that pressed jam) and threw it away! If you knew my husband, you'd understand that the cake had to be remarkably bad for him to do that! \nBottom line: the Black Forrest from Safeway for 3rd of the price of Schubert's tastes better. That should tell you something. \nPeople say that Schubert's mousses are good, and they are, but mousses are almost as good in many bakeries in the Richmond for, literally, half the price, so why overpay? And although not as nearly tasty as before,  Opera and Swedish Princess are still good, especially considering that you can't get them anywhere else in the neighborhood.    \nI am really sad: the quality dipped so low, but yet the owners are milking the original name and reputation for all its worth!", "author": "MS S."}

I love the fruit tarts at both places because they look wondrous and are nto overly sweet.  While both places fill their fruit tarts to the brim with fresh fruit, I've noticed that Porto's has been cutting cost and using nasty canned peaches and pears on some of their fruit tarts.  I also think Shubert's has a better crust because it was just hard enough to hold everything together, but was so easy to cut and bite through (it just crumbles in your mouth).  I'll have to come back to try their fruit cake, which I overheard from one of their regular patrons was delicious enough for her to attempt to place an order for one two weeks in advance (the fruit cakes are only made during holiday season apparently).", "author": "Will L."}

Aside from Princess Cake, and other cakes, Schubert's also has a wide variety of pastries to choose from, which is what I opted for this time:\n\n-Mini Hazelnut? Pistachio? Cookies ($4.25): I can't remember which flavor cookies we got, but they were delicious! They were buttery tasting and not too sweet, which made it very easy to eat half the bag without noticing. Highly recommended!\n-Danish ($2.35, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/schuberts-bakery-san-francisco?select=Pq-viAX1iaXtLIkrd71AFg#Pq-viAX1iaXtLIkrd71AFg): This was good, but nothing special.

However, I haven't met a hot cross bun that I've liked, so I'm just going to skip trying anymore of these. \n\nMy only complaint about Schubert's is that they don't have the most efficient ordering system. The customers just mill around until one of the employees is available to help them, and it's on the honor system of helping whoever came first.

When I say light and fluffy, I don't mean flavorless at all - it is so packed with delicate flavors and nice textures that play well off the tastes.

I first learned about this bakery from Cassie J Rinky N, and Shannon F and their stellar reviews, and was able to order the cake ahead of time with a great deal of convenience. They bake their cakes fresh daily and the Princess Cake is usually available by 11 in the morning. By the time I stopped by to visit with fellow Yelper Fia R, the bakery was bustling with cake enthusiasts at every turn. \n\nThe squared shaped bakery is put together with a small seating area and two huge glass cases adorned with all sorts of cakes stacked on display. Above it all was a row of overhead boards listing an extensive selection of cakes that ranged from three distinct categories: Mousse Cakes, Buttercream Cakes, and Whipped Cream Cakes. I was so pleased with all the exquisite presentations I was tempted to get an additional cake for the event.\n\nThe 8 inch Swedish Princess Cake ($27.95) came out looking like a big tennis ball. It was layered with smooth marzipan icing and whipped cream over a moist white spongy cake embodied with raspberry and custard fillings. The sticky elastic texture coming from the marzipan icing gave a nice contrast to the light whipped cream and smooth custard, and the overall taste was sensational and perfectly sweet. The cake was easy to slice into and the perfect size to feed the eight of us with leftovers. \n\nService was quick, friendly, responsive, and efficient. The bakery gets really busy throughout the day but their staff does a great job at keeping a sense of order. Next time I'll have to try their Saint Honore Cake and see how they compare to Dianda's. Their Mousse Cakes seem to be their top sellers too so I hope to have plenty of chances to come back to visit. 5 stars for originality and refined balance between texture, moisture, and flavor.", "author": "Daniel L."}

My boyfriend's friend had this delicious cake at his party. Once we saw this store across the street from Green Apple we had to go in and see what all the hype is about. \n\nIt was clean and had a lot of open space. It was run like those bakeries in Chinatown but the ladies actually looked like they want to be there. The service was quick!\n\nWe got a slice of the\n\nSwedish Princess Cake- the infamous cake from the party. I did not like the green fondant! It was like a bad piece of candy! The cake itself was alright. The texture was different throughout the entire cake. The bottom was very crusty. Did not like that. My boyfriend loved it though. \n\nI would like to come again and try another cake. I probably just don't like this one.", "author": "Sarah C."}

The cake is moist and full of the marzipan flavor, which is what I truly love about this cake. The tart raspberry filling inside the cake cancels out the sweetness of the marzipan fondant so that it doesn't taste as sweet. All of their cakes are presented well and beautifully.

We tried the shockingly lime-green coated Swedish Princess cake, a fruit tart, and a raspberry mousse.  Every one of these were delicious and delicate.  The light cream and crumbly crust might be the best I ever had in a fruit tart, the mousse had a refreshing tart, and the Swedish Princess, very fluffy, like air.\n\nSchubert's is small, the space primarily occupied by the counters with rows and rows of their baked goods.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-15", "description": "Having meaning to make a trip to Schuberts for many moons, I managed to remember on my way home from the Golden Gate park and quickly made an exit from the CA-1/Park Presidio Dr on Clement St for my tryst with the patisserie.\n\nUpon making my way in to what was a tiny little shop with about 4 tables indoors, I mulled over the goodies like a kid in a candy store, except, this wasn't a kid and I was in a cake shop. I picked up an Italian Rum pastry and mulled over my choices as I enjoyed my rummy chocolatey entity of goodness.\n\nHere is an attempt to review all that I had:\n\nOpera - although it looks like a slimmer cousin of the Italian Rum, at first sight, it was anything but. There was a coffee bean on top and had a very \"coffeechic\" flavour in essence. I particularly enjoyed the slightly 'chewy' texture of the underlying layers of cake against the backdrop of the crunchy nuts on it. With every bite of it I went \"Wow\" and I think this is the start of a budding love-affair with this tantalising lady.\n\nItalian rum - the smooth chocolate frosting with crunchy nuts and soft layers of cakes underneath offset each other really well.\n\nPetit fours passion fruit - it had a very interesting fruity flavor with mango mousse between the layers of cake\n\nPetit fours hazelnut - this pastry reminded me of a marzipan chocolate candy. I didn't feel the hazelnut which made me wonder if the girl mixed them up; I had asked her to remove the chocolate petit-fours she had added. But absolutely no regrets as it was still delicious!\n\nSwedish princess - the green fondant is citrusy in flavor with a soft layer of cream directly beneath it. I'd like to say it tasted lemony but that's not it; it tastes familiar but I just can't quite put a finger to it (passionfruit, perhaps?). The rest of it is pretty much a layered sponge cake with raspberry jam or some mixed-fruit preserve lining it that reminded me of a swiss roll. While still tasty, the rest of it doesn't quite measure up to the outer two layers of fondant and cream. The middle layer had a berry-based creamy spread that I wish formed every layer of this pastry; and I am sure we would have had another winner right here!\n\nBlack forest - the \"vanilla ice-cream\" of pastries, the black forest has always been the safest choice. Rarely, if ever, do patisseries get this wrong (except for Safeway -- dry and crumbly ugh!) not because it's easy but, due to it's popularity, most aspiring chefs probably learn how to make it like a fundamental essential step in Baking-101. The chocolate cake base was spongy and moist alternating with thick layers of fresh cream with a layer that was bursting with cherries. In an ever so slight twist, the whole slice was sitting on a thin layer of firmer (sponge, vanilla?) cake that, besides providing structural support, added it's own flavor to the mix.\n\nWhite chocolate raspberry mousse - a tri-storeyed dessert with the raspberry mousse, white chocolate mouse, and a sponge cake layered in that order, this was a veritable powerhouse. The mousse layers are well set firm and bouncy. The top was glazed with a tangy raspberry preserve with shavings of white chocolate. The lightly sour flavour of the raspberry mousse offset the sweet and creamy white-chocolate mousse layer pretty well, with the sponge cake providing for a variance in texture and taste. I am not a huge fan of preserves spread on dessert pastries but I will let this one slide. I dunno why but it reminds me of lemon curd a little. Well, maybe it's the texture combined with the zestiness of the raspberry layer.\n\nLemon mousse - Wow ! What a surprise! This is the last one I sampled, of the lot, and it has a *very* interesting construction. As opposed to the tried and tested structure of one layer over the other, this one was whimsically fashioned with a layer that went *around* the base of the pastry. Yes. Around! I can't recall having eaten one fashioned in such a manner! The mousse is essentially a lemon glaze with raspberries sitting atop a lemony zesty mousse set on a circular angel cake surrounded by said layer of spotted-striped cake wrapped around it. The wrapped cake is slightly chewy and the taste is not something I can recall; the closest I can get to describing it is Orange. I only wish they made whole cakes of just this wrap. That would be so amazing.\n\nLastly, I wanted the Napoleon too but by the time I decided, the two I saw were already long gone.\n\nIn conclusion, Schubert's Bakery is spot on, I was disappointed with nary a single offering, and the price was moderate and reasonable at about $3.50 apiece.\n\nPostscript: But nope, I still don't agree with berry/fruit preserves on my cake based pastries. To me it's like a cheap shortcut to getting the desired flavour completely ignoring the fact that it doesn't work, but serves to be a jarring reminder that preserves do not belong there.", "author": "Umesh T."}

The best part is the green marzipan on the outside of the cake. Yum yum yum. This cake is also really moist a couple days later. I've never tried the Princess cake from Ikea, so I can't compare the flavors between the two.\n\nThe Tiramisu is good, but it's extremely sweet. I feel like I get diabetes every time I eat this cake. The decorations on this cake is extremely pretty.\n\nI don't really remember the Mango Mousse cake. The cake must not stand out compared to the other cakes.\n\nThe ordering process is easy. You order your cake with the pick up time and cake text through their website, and pay with a credit card. You receive a copy of your invoice in your email inbox.

I purchased an 8 inch Princess Cake online and ordering could not be any easier. I only wish that the cake prices weren't so steep! The cake was chilled when I picked it up (you can also state that you would like it to be kept in their freezer until pick up if not to be consumed within a reasonable time after pick up). The green marzipan was so good and usually raspberry things aren't to my fancy, but altogether this cake was pretty good. I would have given Schubert's a 5 star rating, but the pricing is something that I can't overlook. Sure, I understand that the Princess Cake, as well as all the cakes they make here, are popular, but for the prices you pay for the cake sizes, I wish we could get a little more.", "author": "Alex T."}

Sometimes my head is in the fog, and I do things like that.\n\nI was out shopping when my friend called and suggested that she and her sister wanted to drop by later in the evening for a visit.  Since I was already in the Inner Richmond I suggested picking up a cake from Schubert's.  My friend suggested picking up three cake slices instead for a bit of variety.  I'm still not sure how I ended up buying four cake slices.  It worked out though as we split each slice into three pieces each.\n\nWe had the Swedish Princess (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DyXoC_NhJW0Xx5j_OPQRHQ?select=k7J1jAn5QS-V3w2zjw-PKg).  My friend said she didn't care what I picked up as long as one was the Swedish Princess.  I didn't think I would feel very manly by telling her that Schubert's princess cake was one of my all-time favorites so I quietly enjoyed my portion of the moist cake, smooth custard, tart jelly and marzipan as if I was trying it for the very first time.\n\nMy friend's sister loves chocolate covered cherries hence my selection of a slice of Black Forest (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DyXoC_NhJW0Xx5j_OPQRHQ?select=bJ5xoTcApCerfK7JcQHp9A).  I recall having tried this once before but I never noticed the thin shortbread layer on the bottom of the chocolate cake, whipped cream and chunky cherry filling.  It was very good but probably more so because I had not had it in awhile.\n\nThe consensus on the Double Mousse (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DyXoC_NhJW0Xx5j_OPQRHQ?select=i6sRF8Gv0kjs84dUl2DRqg) was that it was a bit rich.  There is lots of cream and whipped custard but very little cake.  It was at this point that we really enjoyed having the hot beverages to go with our cake.\n\nThe Neapolitan (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/DyXoC_NhJW0Xx5j_OPQRHQ?select=RJe5SKzNDqE1LyULkdwIsw) was my favorite with coffee and berry flavored creams sandwiched in between layers of moist chocolate and yellow cakes and a thin layer of tart raspberry jelly finished off with a smooth chocolate ganache.  Thin pieces of bittersweet chocolate were added to the sides and the chocolate covered rice crispy balls sprinkled on top made for an interesting contrast in flavor and texture.\n\nI don't visit Schubert's too often, but when I do I can always count on beautifully made treats that are rich and delicious and so bad for me!  I guess that's what makes it so good!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

This man came out of nowhere and picked it up. He told the workers he found it on the floor and  tried to give it to them. They didn't want to take it so he bought a personal fruit tart and  told them to keep the change. He was such a kind and honest person. \n\nAnyways, when I entered the bakery, I noticed the chalk boards with beautiful writing on it. The chalk boards listed the items that are available along with their description. I thought that was very useful since it was my first time at this place. \n\nEverything I bought was priced at $3.45 each. I left the bakery with  Opera Cake, Raspberry Mousse, Cappuccino Mousse, and Princess Cake. The Opera Cake was pretty delicious and so was the Princess Cake. On the other hand,  I was very disappointed in the Raspberry Mousse because the cake was very dry. Maybe it was old? Sometimes looks can be deceiving and that was the case for the Raspberry Mousse. It was definitely beautiful and it's a shame that it didn't taste good.  I actually wanted to try the Raspberry White Chocolate Mousse, but ordered the Raspberry Mousse by accident.

She was friendly and very accommodating even when we were indecisive. We ended up getting a slice of princess cake, a raspberry croissant, and a fruit tart.\nI am personally not a huge fan of marzipan but I must say the princess cake was very good. The marzipan added nice texture to the light and fluffy cake and cream. The flavors balanced well without being too sweet from the marzipan. The fruit tart was excellent. Light and flaky crust with good custard and fresh fruit. The raspberry croissant was the only problem. The raspberry filling was simple raspberry jam but much too sweet. The croissant itself was incredible when I didn't get a piece of jam in it: light, flaky, and perfectly buttery.\nAn overall good bakery and I'd love to come back and try what other baked goods they have.", "author": "Bryant C."}

Given the opportunity to come here on a weekly basis, I'd go broke, get fat, and probably become a diabetic. Not that there's anything wrong with enjoying the sweet simple pleasures in life, but these highly addictive delights are not meant to be eaten in moderation even if you tried.\n\nThere's only one reason I'll stop by Schubert's - Swedish princess cake. In my first two visits, they had run out. Saddened by the absence of my craved confection, I was open to tasting their other deliciously baked goods. Their berry flavored mousse cakes and cheesecakes are piercing with tartness, but their tropical flavors tend to be more subtle and easy to nibble on. The cassis mousse was especially tart, squinting in discomfort with each bite. Never again, but I'm not mad. This wasn't the main event I came here for.\n\nFinally during my third visit, showcased behind the glass display case, there they were...2 beautiful slices of marzipan wrapped raspberry custard filled princess cakes. I raced to the counter to beat out the crowd of indecisive customers, locking in the remaining 2 slices. Like a kid in a candy factory, I told the clerk \"Princess cake, please!!!\" Shockingly, she replied with \"I'm sorry, we're currently out\". Confused, I quickly pointed out the 2 slices right below me. She said those have been \"damaged\", so there's a 30% discount if I wanted to take them. I took a peek and saw no such damage, but the 30% sealed the deal without any hesitation. Mission accomplished!\n\nTaking my little joys home, I carefully inspected the cakes to make sure there really wasn't anything wrong with them. The only \"damage\" I saw was a bit of marzipan scraped off the edges, but that's it. So for Schubert's to discount their baked goods for a slightly distorted presentation, that really shows they care about the quality of their products. I love that!! And I loved my princess cake!

When I stepped in there wasn't a line yet. I stood there and waited patiently for someone to help me. A man walked in a couple of minutes later and the person behind the counter greeted him and asked if he needed some help. I jumped in and told her I was here before him. She snapped at me and told me I was not it line. I was a bit confused since I was the only person standing there for those few minutes. I guess there was a tape there and I was suppose to stand on the other side of it eventhough I was the only person there at that time. I brushed it off and looked at three different chocolate cakes they had available. One was chocolate with nuts around it, the other was chocolate with shaving on it and lastly there was one with chocolate whipped creme. I asked the lady about the first one and she told me its chocolate mousse cake, I asked about the second one and she gave me the same response, then I asked about the third one and still the same response. I am not stupid because the cake menu board has different type of cake listed. So I wanted her to be specific and I asked her what was in each cake and she gave me the same stupid response. She said, \"some chocolate and some cake!\" I started to feel agitated so I requested a tiramisu cake that was listed on the menu board. The next visit I hope I do not get her. The cakes are great there and I been buying cakes from there for over 15 years. I just don't like that particular person now.

When I think about this cake, I wish I hadn't been the first one married among my siblings, because then this would have been MY wedding cake. \n\nSchubert's makes the very best Swedish princess cake you could eat. For years after I had this cake at my sister's wedding, I had to order Swedish princess cake at every bakery I went to.

The marzipan is thin and delicious; the genoise cake itself is soft and spongey and the the best part is that the buttercream on top to form the dome shape was well-made and there wasn't an overdose of it, a common fatality in most princess cakes. \n\nThe rest of the items that I tried were only so-so, but considering the price for most slices is only $3.75 instead of say, $5 for a small cake, you get what you pay for. One thing I am not a big fan of is their cheesecakes. They are a little too gooey and sweet. Their mousse cakes are quite popular. There is just one layer of mousse, however, and I  prefer a multi-layer cake, maybe with 2 thinner layers. Some of the mousses are more flavorful than others. I saw a cassis one for the first time during my last trip there, and it was my favorite thus far. \n\nMurata's cafe in Japantown seems to carry cake slices from Schubert. I saw many small cakes I ate at Schubert's for sale there, including the Swedish Princess cake.", "author": "Alice L."}

I love that they give an option of the tiny cakes so if you suddenly have a craving for something sweet and delicious, you don't have to buy a whole cake and feel too guilty. Although I've never had La Baguette French Bakery cakes, just comparing their mini cakes, Schuberts is alot cheaper at about $3.75 vs. $5.00 cakes.

They offer a huge array of cakes, ranging from decadent chocolate cakes to light mousse cakes. I've never had a cake from Schubert's that I didn't like.  Their mango mousse deserves particularly high praise. I've tried iterations of mango mousse cake from several other bakeries and nothing comes close to Schubert's. Schubert's mousse is just so light and airy, yet full of delicious mango flavor. The sponge cake is delicate and moist, not dense and dry like at many other places. \n\nDuring the holidays, this place gets packed with customers waiting to pick up cakes, but I've never not been able to get the cake I wanted, so props to them for keeping up with demand. \n\nOn the downside, there are only a few tables available for sit-down.

The store name is huge on the outside. You can't miss it.\n\nAppearance: First thing I saw when I entered, a huge variety of vibrant, colorful cakes and pastries sitting there waiting for me! Oh my gosh...me and my friend, Chelsey, literally were like kids at a candy store, putting our faces to the display windows, deciding which ones we wanted to eat but had a hard time choosing because we wanted them all! Ah I'm craving it right now as I'm typing about it! Basically, I'm saying, you can't resist getting a dessert from here. The set up of the place was a decent size store, open enough, Two big sections of cakes and pastries. There's also a bread section but sorry I was not on a mission for bread. Lots of people were coming in. And I love how there's elderly, Chinese people sitting there having a dessert with their coffee. There was a group of ladies sitting at one table as if this is their usual hangout spot. Adorable!\n\nService: Plenty of employees there to help every customer out. They were nice and patient with me and Chelsey because we took a while making our final decisions.\n\nFood: It really is hard to choose which cake you want because they look all too good. A lot of colors and variety from the cream, glazes, the fresh fruit, chocolate finishing touches on top of the cakes. Some had smiley faces on them. They are a little bit on the pricier range because they're specialty cakes but I had to indulge myself. I will spend on desserts. I ordered the mixed fruit tart, the napoleon, and the chocolate mousse cake. Each one was about $3.75. Even after I sat down ready to eat, I still couldn't choose which one to start with! Napoleon: crunchy crust, lots of cream, and fruits aligned for every bite of the napoleon. Chocolate mousse cake: Chocolatey heavenly goodness! Moist and melts in your mouth but a bit messy with the flakes falling out from the surface of it. Fruit tart: I knew it would not disappoint me unlike other fruit tarts I've had.\n\nMy newest favorite bakery.

If I were a gambling lady, I'd bet that our cake was the cheapest one of the 8 weddings.\n\nSchubert's Bakery is a bustling place on Irving in Chinatown where business is always booming.  It does not make for the best sit down experience, but I always order to-go.  \n\nAs for wedding planning, the woman I spoke with on the phone was not too friendly, but the young lady who assisted us with the cake sampling was very accommodating and organized.  We tried about 5 different cake flavors with an actual free slice at the end to boot.  I brought an image of the style I wanted  for the cake and the baker did a phenomenal job replicating it.  Schubert's Bakery is good about responding to emails and their delivery rate within SF is quite reasonable.  Might I add that instead of freezing the top layer of your cake to eat on your first anniversary, Schubert's Bakery lets your redeem a free cake (one layer, of course) on your anniversary?  \n\nOverall, this bakery is a wonderful place both for a quick snack to-go and for special events.

It was not yet surrounded then by Asian culture.  The concept of New Chinatown was still years away in the sense that we now experience it.  Schubert's held an iconic position in the 70s as a great bakery in the tradition of European bakeries.  The current iteration still has its original class ... the standards are still the same.  I can not say the same for my metabolism.  What I could enjoy in my 20s compared to my current dietary selections means that my visits to Schubert's has to be quite limited ... and mostly really a fond memory.  \n\nIf I wanted a baked good representative of European traditions, I'd surely pick Schubert's even after all these years as my go-to location.

Year after year after year, for every special occasion, we always get a cake from good ol' Schubert's!  \n\nThe last time I got a cake here was for Father's Day, and like the one million other times I've ordered a cake here, it was reliable and delicious.  I think that the best item on their seriously extensive menu is the double chocolate mousse cake.  It's got chocolate and white chocolate mousse in the center, as well as two layers of cake - chocolate and err...cake-flavored layers.  The whipped cream is light, fluffy, EXCELLENT.  The chocolate pieces are always fun to munch on - quality chocolate!  And I don't even really like chocolate!\n\nTheir other cakes are also really good, you can't really go wrong here.  The Napoleon is great, and each layer is good!  As is the Tiramisu.  Although, I would caution that if you do get either of these two, make sure to eat them right away because otherwise they get kind of wet and soggy, and that's no good!  \n\nThe Swedish Princess is a classic if you're into lots of whipped cream and fruit and no-frills.  The Black Forest is a must-get if you're a chocolate lover, which is most people.  Even their cookies are good!\n\nEverything here is good.  8\" cakes run about $30/cake, and if you're pre-ordering, you should probably call in two days before you intend to pick it up.  One time I ordered a cake one day beforehand, and they didn't have it ready by the next day - totally my fault.  \n\nSchubert's is yet another reason why I like holidays, birthdays, Mom and Dad days.

The party was supposed to be on Wednesday, then moved to Friday, then to Thursday and finally back to Friday.\n\nI ordered cakes for pick up on Friday and when I called my boss to remind her to pick up the cakes, she says, \"Oh no, it's supposed to be on Wednesday!\"\n\nLuckily, the wonderful staff at Schuberts completely understood and allowed me to reschedule my order for the following Wednesday.  What a great bakery with fantastic customer service!  \n\nGreat customer service is hard to find these days, so when I find it, I like to shout it to the moon and tell everyone who will listen.  Schuberts is an exemplary business and I am proud to do business with them.  \n\nSchuberts, thank you for your yummy, beautiful cakes and A+ customer service!", "author": "Teena O."}

And all the cakes are freaking good to be PC. \n\nI recommend their Swedish Princess cake (comes in cake form AND slices) but you have to be a fan of marzipan. The large and individual size mousse cakes fit all occasions and come in several flavors, my favorite is mango which has a definite fresh sweet mango celebration in your mouth. Other baked goods are equally fantastic, you can't go wrong here - nothing is too sweet or taste artificial, it's all honest and baked with care.\n\nTo top the good goodies, the service is friendly and fast, even when the place is swamped with people trying to decide which of the tempting cakes they pick. And they decorate any cake while you wait with a personal message, of course - but it's always good to call ahead and order so you get what you want.", "author": "Finn T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-26", "description": "They say that with age, comes wisdom; in this case, wisdom also comes with deliciously-created cakes!  Schubert's Bakery is one of those RARE examples of how a business that can survive over 100 years must be doing something right as it must also be doing it really well.  My friends and I made the itinerant drive through random parts of SF (after a short hike @ Land's End) in hopes of being rewarded with beautiful cakes that tasted as good as the reviews indicated they would.   I am happy to say YES, Schubert's lives up their hyped reviews and deserves to stay open another 100 years! (if humanity manages to survive that long.....I hope Schubert's does)\n\nOne thing that sticks out when one \"discovers\" Schubert's for the 1st time is that it's situated in an almost all-Chinese/Asian neighborhood.  If you didn't know the history of it, you would have thought it's owners probably got lost or found a place that had really cheap rent and chose to set up a completely non-Asian bakery there.  In fact, the exact opposite is true since 99% of all other businesses probably closed down or moved away as the Asian invasion of the 20th century permeated SF.   This alone should give Schubert's one star just for resisting the desire to move elsewhere (and probably get better business in the city).\n\nUpon walking inside this \"mom n pop\" bakery, you ll find a few small tables/chairs as well as an L shaped display case.  These tables/chairs are perfect for those impetuous, must-eat-now customers who buy a slice and can't resist taking a few bites (or the whole slice).   Since we were just visitors and didn't really have a home to go back to, we ate our slices there with the provided plates and forks.  In terms of the cake variety, you ll find a menu with over 20 cakes: mousse/regular cake/cheese cake varieties.  Some of them sound great, some of them sound okay, but it's still hard to decide on what to get!! I took about...10 minutes to choose my one slice.  Individual mini cakes/slices go for $3.95, entire cakes start at $22 up to $37 depending on the size you get.\n\nThe cakes we ended up getting (and sharing a few bites) were the Swedish Princess, Mango Mousse, Chocolate Almond, and mine was Neapolitan.  Each of these cakes had their own distinct tastes (duh) and all four were good.  However, I did prefer my cake as it came with two large slabs of dark chocolate on the sides, and the cake was mostly cake and less cream/mousse.  The Swedish Princess looked really cool (lime green frosting), but the taste overall was kinda just \"sweet\" and good.  \n\nThe Mango Mousse was light, fluffy and not too sweet, so I enjoyed the two bites that I had (but im not a huge fan of mousse since it isn't \"filling\").  The Chocolate Hazelnut Almond cake was the sweetest of the four, so I would probably need milk to eat that entire piece.  Did I favor my own cake because I spent 10 minutes choosing it? Maybe....probably....but I mean everyone always gives self-bonus points to their own choices right? :)  \n\nOverall, Schubert's Bakery is a must-visit place for a fan of sweets and gourmet cakes.  This isn't your ordinary bakery where the cakes are made in bulk and sold for $10 for like a 30\" cake (i.e. Costco).  Come with a slight rumble in your stomach and an open mind to a different spectrum of pastries and you will not be disappointed :)\n\nAs I wrote this review, I was eating a 4-day old piece of cheesecake.  Now only did it still taste DELICIOUS, it pretty means the cheesecake was either super fresh.....or I'm going to be sick shortly :P", "author": "Rob C."}

I was immediately overwhelmed by how many wonderful cakes, tarts, pies, cookies, etc., were staring at me. I really didn't have much time to spare, so I had to make up my mind pretty quickly. Even though I wanted to sample everything, I couldn't afford to do so. Given that I'm a Mango Freak, I had to order the Mango Mousse Cake. I gave in a bit, and ordered a few Mini Mixed Fruit Tarts as well, because the mango in the Mango Mousse Cake was clearly not enough for me. :0\n\nLet me just say that I was counting the minutes to when the cake was to be served, and by golly, it was so worth the wait. The mousse was sweet, and there was mango bursting with every single bite. The cake was super light, fluffy, and moist, and OH MYLANTA, it was pure heaven. Everyone at the party, from my mom, family friends, and more importantly, the guest of honor, totally raved about this cake and asked where I got it, etc., Needless to say, we are all huge fans. BTW, I had at least two slices.\n\nOh, I can't forget about the fruit tart, which was absolutely delish. The crust was perfect, and the fruits (mango, papaya, strawberry, kiwi) were so fresh and sweet. I wish there were more mango pieces. I just can't get enough of my fav fruit!

I'm usually a big fan of pretty standard but good-quality cake with a high emphasis on the chocolate, and this time was a little different, as he purchased what their website lists as the Opera cake (\"hazelnut sponge with chocolate truffle and mocha-praline filling topped with toasted almonds\")  (https://www.schuberts-bakery.com  --Special Cakes -- Opera Cake). \n\nThe presentation was very classy and well-done but fairly simple with the chocolate icing thin on the top and sides, crushed nuts on the sides and along the edge of the top, the message he requested written in beautiful script on a rectangular piece of white chocolate propped up by some curved pieces of chocolate which matched the icing, and a handful of chocolate flowers of varying sizes. With a birthday so close to Halloween, I'm usually a big fan of the silly spooky-themed cake decorations, but this was a really lovely cake which fit the fancy cocktail party theme even better and was very well-received by everyone. \n\nThe cake was perfect- not dry, flavorful, perfect proportions of the top and bottom layers of cake to the similar layer of filling between, thin layer of rich icing along the top and sides-- this cake wasn't all about the chocolate, but somehow the mixture of flavors and richness of the chocolate present was still highly satisfying for me, and my guests really loved it. \n\nUpon checking out the website, I find that his order was probably the 8\"x12\" for $40.95, which I find even better than reasonable considering the really high quality of the cake, prices I've paid for far less in the past, and inflation of everything in this city. \n\nTry them! I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed!

I've gotten cakes from Dianda's multiple times, and have been happy with them, but was looking for a richer ganache type chocolate cake. I ordered the chocolate mousse with shavings from Schubert's and everyone loved it. It was rich and sweet, best had with coffee.\n\nI was also curious about their other cakes, so I bought a slice of the Opera and a small Mango Mousse (based on other reviews) for everyone to try. The Opera cake was also delicious. It was rich, a bit sweeter than the chocolate mousse, and kind of reminded me of Nutella. While I would gladly eat it again, I don't think I could ever finish a whole slice.\n\nThe mango mousse was also delightful. While I will always choose chocolate, we were all impressed by the rich fruit flavor. It was something special that I was glad I got to try, and several of my friends said it was their favorite. The only fruit cake that I've ever had that would win against this cake is Tartine's passion fruit cake. However, I think of Tartine's cake as more of a bucket list, \"everyone should try this once in their life\" kind of a thing, and Schubert's as a cake I would order for a celebration. If I were buying a cake for someone that is into fruit over chocolate, I would definitely order this one.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed the three cakes I tried from Schubert's.

I was still irked about it that day so I went to the website and made a complaint in the comments section, stating that I knew morning business was good and busy, but I felt my business was important also.\nI received a reply from the owner who apologized and agreed with me.  He said he talked to the morning crew and asked for my address so he could send me a gift certificate.\n\nI really appreciated that the owner addressed the issue which showed tremendous responsibility and appreciation of his customers. It was an added bonus to receive such a generous gift certificate.  So I've gone back to Schubert's.\n\nThe Napoleon cake is out of this world!  We had that in June for my daughter's 2nd birthday.  My guests and I couldn't get enough of it.  This strawberry shortcake that we ordered for today was a good $130 which goes to show how much we love Schubert's, talented baking and trust them to make such an important cake for our oldest daughter's 5th birthday!", "author": "Kekumukula N."}

And I had the biggest sweet tooth in the world. I could eat a whole jar of frosting. I know I'm digusting. Don't look at me. Anyway my friend and I were picking up food on Clement. And the idea of getting cake after dim sum is like the best idea in the world. We got a fruit tart and one of the mousses. I forget which, but they were really tasty. I wanted to try the Swedish princess cake, but they only had them in bigger sizes. On another day, I picked one up, of course after picking up a pink box filled with dim sum, and shared it with a friend. And it was quite yummy.

However, because of the extremity of my situation, I can say with equal confidence that I do recommend visiting Schubert's. Whether or not you're getting married, actually.\n\nIt was one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had. Sabine, the baker, was friendly and collaborative, but she was also quick to use her expertise to help narrow down our options and find what I was looking for. The generous cake samples probably helped too. (:\n\n(One slight disappointment: Sabine said that a marzipan coating would work with our Italian rum cake just as well as the traditional fondant. In fact, our guests found it kind of overwhelming. I love marzipan, though.)\n\nMy fiancee and I wanted a cake that was chocolatey, not too sweet, and interesting without being potentially off-putting to our less adventurous relatives. The Italian rum cake was exactly what we wanted, and we got it more quickly than we had any right to expect, at a surprisingly low price. And it was utterly delicious.

The cakes are very light, fluffy, and not too sweet.

Most personal sized desserts are $3.45, and the full sized cakes can cost up to $20.  There's always a constant flow of traffic coming through this bakery, which is a good sign.

Kinda surprising for this diehard chocolate lover to pass up the mousse cake for a pastel green thing that squishes when you try to fork up a bite, but it's just so good. I actually met somebody from the Bay Area when I was in Maui this summer and we ended up rhapsodizing over the Princess cake at Schubert's while sitting watching a tropical sunset!\n\nThey actually have good coffee too, which I find unusual for a local bakery.

To top it off, the prices are so reasonable per slice.  I always end up buying at least two pieces each visit.

For many years, Schubert's has done an excellent job of satisfying my sweet tooth!\n\nThey're best known for their cakes which are beautifully showcased in the glass display.  The shiny glaze atop the various mousse cakes, the fluffy cream and chocolate shavings of the tiramisu, and the chocolate ganache garnished with toasted almonds all scream Eat me! Eat me!\n\nSome of my favorites are:\n\n* Mousse Cakes - They come in various fruit flavors such as, mango, strawberry, tropical and peach, raspberry, lemon and currant.  The mousse is covered with a brilliant glaze and is very light, tasty, slightly tart and sits on top of a soft sponge cake.  The edge of many of the mousse cakes is lined with ladyfingers and wrapped with a red ribbon making it look like a beautiful gift!  The Tiramisu Mousse and Chocolate Mousse are divine and taste just perfectly, not being too sweet or too rich.  The Chocolate Mousse with Almonds is presented slightly differently as it is covered with an amazing chocolate ganache and garnished with toasted almonds on the edge . . . very delicious!\n\n* Swedish Princess - I was never a fan of marzipan until being introduced to this delightful creation.  A lime green marzipan-covered mound, which resembles something you would see in outer space, tastes out of this world!  The thin layer of marzipan is perfect as it covers moist white cake layers with thin strips of raspberry and kirsch custard filling and whip cream . . . just the right level of sweetness and richness!\n\n* Italian Rum Cake - This is my all-time favorite!  A white and chocolate buttercream cake filled with chocolate and rum custard.  The cake is super moist and soft and the light custard is perfectly blended and not overpowering.  I'm craving a piece right now!\n\n* Napoleon - For those of you who need a little crunch in your cake, this is a great choice.  With layers of crunchy puff pastry filled with strawberries, rum custard and whip cream, surrounded by ladyfingers and wrapped in a red ribbon, this makes a perfect gift for your appetite.\n\nSchubert's is such a wonderful bakery as their cakes are very reasonably priced, they offer a convenient and efficient online ordering system, the service is friendly and quick, and their cakes are SO BEAUTIFUL!

The princess cake which according to their website is their \"delicious white cake layers with raspberry and kirsch custard filling, whipped cream and marzipan icing!\"  I think it's their best selling cake and is only $26.95 for their medium size which feeds 10 to 12 people!   \n\nI picked one up for New Year's eve and everyone loved it!  \nSooooo.... if you need a birthday cake or just want to satisfy your sweet tooth or brighten up your day, stop by here and pick up a cake, a slice or a couple and you'll be good to go! \n\nYummmmy!

The employee sounded irritated when I asked her about the difference between flavors in cakes. Second incident the associate in the store did not want to provide me plates. She said they dont do that. She was new. When she saw I was irritated she said ok I'll give you plates but dont tell anyone. This is not good customer service.\n\n05.12.12.

I came in to the bakery to place an order with the intention of seeing how each cake looks like since I was being picky with the design. They had a good selection on display, but a lot of their specialty cakes weren't available since it is made to order. After much debate, I placed an order for the Italian Rum.\n\nCustomer service: I thought they lacked in this area. The girls didn't seem overly helpful and seemed bother that I had questions. C'mon, I was ordering a cake for a special birthday! Then, when I called a few days later to change my order to the Pineapple Delight, the gal who answered was even more rude! 'Well, what do you want to change? Ok, what did you order?' All spoken with an attitude.\n\nThe cake: moist and very liquidy. Plenty of pineapple pieces, in fact I thought it was a little too much. Whipped cream was light and not too sweet at all. Definitely a cake that makes you feel less guilty because it doesn't feel like it's loaded with butter and sugar. At first I was a little hesitant they would make the top of the cake appear too girly, but they added a nice touch with a more neutral design.\n\nOverall, the cake price was decent- 10\" for $37 and the cake came out with no complaints.

They sell a huge variety from considerably small shop; goods range from cakes to pastries to cookies. \n\nI've tried two mousse cakes here: tiramisu and mango mousse cake. Both are very light but deliver a lot of flavor.  \n\nThe other cake I've tried is the Swedish Princess (their signature cake if I'm not mistaken?). It's the lime-green color frosted cake with RASPBERRY & CUSTARD. Words will do it no justice and you just have to try it. Truly one of a kind. \n\nThe last item I need to rave about is....the VIENESSE FRUIT TORTE!!! Or simply put, a fruit tart. BUT it's not your average tart, no no no no no. The crust is not flaky like traditional fruit tarts. It's pretty dense since it's made from shortbread, which becomes very apparent when you carry the tart -- it weighs a good 5 pounds but you know it's packing some savory heat. To top it off there's a sweet menage-a-five of fruits between blueberries, strawberries, pineapple, kiwi and peaches that completes the yummy orgy your mouth is in store for.\n\nSchubert's sets the standard.

Daddy issues aside, it is only appropriate for a princess to have princess cake on her birthday. This year for my little quarter of a century shindig I pre-ordered a larger cake to feed my liquored up patrons. The Richmond is nowhere near where I live nor work and with little time to spare, I settled for ordering over the phone. Part of being a princess is being a control freak and having a \"my way or the highway\" mentality. I was worried about not being able to convey my vision correctly over the phone. I didn't want to go down as the girl who fucked up her own birthday cake with her idiotic ideas.\n\nWhile lime green is one of my favorite colors, I don't find it particularly appetizing so I asked if they could dye the marzipan black. The answer is no. BUT they can spray paint it black which I imagine looks much better than if they had followed my non-professional idea of using black food coloring. I also asked for minimal decorations. A few swirls here and there and the words \"Princess Janelle.\" When I gave her my credit card info she was surprised that I was ordering my own cake but even more in shock at my sense of entitlement. \n\nWhen I saw the cake it was exactly how I envisioned it- sleek and sophisticated... dark and mysterious. Everyone thought I had purchased some heavy, flourless cake that would feel like a brick going down their esophagi. To their pleasant surprise, underneath that tough exterior was a light, fluffy, dainty baked good from heaven. Several people have asked me where I got the cake so they could also marvel in the same success as I did at my party. It  was in July and people STILL ask me about the cake.\n\nWith that said, whom do I speak with about my referral fees?", "author": "Janelle B."}

I can't even describe how awfully delicious this place looks once you walk inside. It's literally like you're in the game Candy Land. \n\nI finally found this place after looking for a good bakery on yelp because one of my coworkers was leaving. I tried ordering a cake the night beforehand on their website but it was a little too last-minute, so I went to pick up one in-store the next day. But their website is pretty helpful and easy to navigate. What I like most is that they have pictures for each of their cakes, so I know what I'm ordering or what I might want.\n\nSo the next morning I called in to see what cakes they had (I wanted the Swedish Princess). The girl who picked up was very nice and informative and took the time to answer all my questions (unlike some other places). The store itself is sugarcoated with cakes of different assortments and shapes and colors; you will have the hardest time deciding which one you want. You really can't go wrong with any selection.\n\nBut I decided to get the Swedish Princess cake because that is the fan favorite. I ended up getting the 10\" cake, which came out to about $36 (not bad for the size and quality). I got it personalized with a message and I was out the door in 10 minutes. \n\nIn terms of the quality of the cake, everyone loved the caked minus the marzipan (they thought it was too sweet). They just don't know what's good and what's hella good. This is hella good.\n\nif you want to try the world's best cakes topped off with excellent customer service, just go to Schubert's.", "author": "David W."}

However: we got the swedish princess cake for a birthday, and the cake itself was pretty good, but the marzipan covering was a little strange. The cake was GORGEOUS, of course. We all happily ate up our initial pieces of cake, but it must not have kept well in the refrigerator, because none of us could eat it after that... the marzipan tasted awful and had a strange consistency. We ended up tossing the rest of the cake, because no one else liked it either.

Their mousse cakes have always been our go-to cakes, and settled on the mango mousse cake for our sheet cake.  It was nice to be able to taste all of the cake flavors, and it only took us a second to settle on the chocolate truffle cake for our actual wedding cake.  \n\nSumming it up, Schubert's makes it very easy, both in the decision-making and on the wallet, to provide your guests with a memorable and give-me-seconds cake to nosh on after dinner and in between dancing the night away.  Keep in mind, they are able to execute only so much for your wedding cake.

I needed a slamming cake or two for my gf's graduation and Schubert's mousse cakes really impressed the whole party.  I got two mousses: strawberry and mango.  They both were \"cooked\" or prepared perfectly and were light yet flavorful.  These guys have been around since 1911 and their quality backs up why they've been around so long.  I did prefer the mango over the strawberry as the mousse is not exactly the same for each type of mousse cake.  I will definitely be back again in the near future: to try the peach and raspberry mousses.  \n\nI also tried the princess cake and I came away unimpressed.  It did have a good marzipan icing but it can be a bit overwhelming.  I'd say this is either you love it or hate it kind of cake.

I'm pretty sure this will be a top contender for my wedding cake, if and when I need a wedding cake. \n\nThey open early and close pretty early. If you want a cake, order ahead, or you only get to choose from what's already there. The popular ones go quick! \n\nI like to come in the morning and get the leftovers or the black sheeps (ones that are cut funny or look deformed) from the day before at a cheaper price. They taste like perfection still, it's just a perk at a lower price.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

I had to act like a tour guide of SF, even though I am from OC but I know my way around the city.  It was a lot of fun.  My sister went to the Oscars and left me in the city, so I made the most of it by having a feast! lol \n\nOne of our stops was Schubert's Bakery because I saw a lot of people rave about it online.  Did I have high hopes? Nah. Did I keep an open mind? Sure.  I have passed by this place many times before when I came to Clement and now I finally made it the goal for the day.  It was towards the end of the day so there were less choices of cake and my friend bought the last ones of a few I wanted! Darn him and his gf! lol j/k\n\nI got the Tropical Mousse, Chocolate Truffle, Strawberry Shortcake, and Opera Cake.  Even though the Opera Cake was not labeled, I recognized it and my friend was surprised.  As a serious foodie, I know my cakes.  O=9 Besides I normally love the Opera Cake at Porto's, cheap and good.  This bakery really reminded me of Porto's down in LA for cakes.  Each slices was just a little under $3.50 so not too bad of a deal in SF.  \n\nThe SS was refreshing and light.  It was not overly sweet and creamy.  I liked the different take on the Opera Cake as well.  There were a lot more nuts and I thought it was good.  You can taste the nutty hazelnut flavor.  The TM was not bad.  It must have been a passion fruit mousse.  The outer layer of the cake was chewy but the center is soft and moist.  Not bad since I didn't get to have the Mango Mousse.  The CT is very chocolatey and rich.  It is probably best to have a glass of milk to pair.  \n\nIf I have a sweet tooth or cake craving next time and don't want to spend too much money then I'd go here for sure.", "author": "Kat L."}

I've always said that I can never date anyone who dislikes chocolate, so we're just friends.  For Christmas, I got him a few random gifts, and he said that he had a gift for me too.  Sweet.  We planned on doing the gift exchange after Christmas, when both of us were done with our holiday travels.\n\nA few days after the holidays, I got a text from Norman.  He'd eaten my present.\n\nAt first, I was totally cool about it, because I figured it was probably just some baked goods (I usually bake him banana nut bread from scratch).  Then he told me that he'd gotten me the holiday pack of Ferrero Rochers (my FAVORITE chocolates EVAR), and that it was the 16- or 18-pack, in the shape of a Christmas tree.  It was just sitting there, waiting to be given to me, and he was just too tempted to eat it, so he did.\n\n\"I thought you didn't even like chocolate!\"\n\"I don't.  But these were just sitting there.  And they were REALLY GOOD.\"\n\nSo, I happened to be in the Inner Richmond one morning and after getting some dim sum, I decided that there was no way I could leave Clement St. without stopping by Schubert's.  I dropped in and picked out the Swedish Princess cake, butter cookies, Tiramisu and a chocolate hazelnut mousse cake (the latter are made into individual cakes rather than slices, like the SP).\n\nOh my good glory, the chocolate hazelnut mousse cake tasted EXACTLY like a scrumptious cake-version of a Ferrero Rocher chocolate!  It was a fluffy chocolate mousse inside, with a rich chocolate ganache on the outside, and it was coated with chopped hazelnuts.  Party in my mouth.\n\nSo, TAKE THAT, Norman!  I don't need your holiday gift pack of Ferrero Rochers!  I've got Schubert's now, and ohhhh it is wonderful!", "author": "Tori S."}

I've started out with the mouses and ventured to their cakes, nothing is too overly sweet, the sponge of the cakes itself are of a nice light moist darn-near-perfection consistency. This is the go-to place for cakes for my family and friends as well, because of the relatively affordable prices (most bang-for-your-buck), and compared with the super trendy/popular bakeries in SF such as Tartine's (which is good stuff), they don't charge you $50 + for a cake that would just feed 8-10 people or less. My two friends ordered their wedding cake from Schubert's and it was the opera (I believe) or 7-layer cake, and the chef where the reception was held had to ask where the cake came from because it was the best he's tasted - It was perfect blend of layers of chocolate, coffee, nutty flavors. As the bakery will proclaim their specialty is the Swedish Princess Cake, which my pals got for my birthday and it is too delicious!!! Again the Marzipan or almond paste is tasty and not too sugary. Go ahead try it for yourself....", "author": "L V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-12", "description": "It's only right that I write my first review for Schubert's Bakery. I hold this bakery near and dear to my heart for many reasons--but mainly, they consistently produce excellent baked goods and sweet delights year after year. Like many, my fond memory of Schubert's began when birthday cakes were bought here for family events since I was a child. It's just a comforting thought to know that this wonderful shop still exists for me to enjoy til this day. \n\nMost popular cakes: Mango Mousse, Swedish Princess, and Tiramisu.\n\nHowever, I think EVERY cake offered is exceptional. \n\nFor the fruit mousse, if you like the Mango mousse, they also have an array of various other fruit flavors as well to cater to your specific choice such as Strawberry, Raspberry, Lemon, Tropical and peach. The mousse cakes are extremely light, yet flavorful. Mousse cakes are good for all ages because it's delicious, but not overly heavy or sweet. It the perfect treat after a big dinner. \n\nFor the \"Swedish Princess\", it is white cake with raspberry filling, kirsch custard, whipped cream, and covered with marzipan (almond paste). Marzipan has a distinct taste that will make you either love it or hate it. For an alternative, Schubert's offers the \"Pink Champagne\" cake which taste just as delicious as the princess cake, but frosted with whipped cream instead of marzipan. (This cake usually requires 1-2 days advance notice to order)\n\nFor the Tiramisu, it's more of a mousse layered on top of chocolate cake and filled with a light version of marscapone filling flavored with coffee liqueur. Fantastic! Other options for chocolate-flavored mousse cakes are the Cappuccino, chocolate, and double chocolate mousse. All very light cakes with powerful chocolate taste. Mmm!\n\nFor non-mousse, Schubert's offers a variety of whipped cream cakes--some of my highly recommended: \"Strawberry Shortcake\" and \"Napoleon\" (puff pastry layers with fresh strawberries, whipped cream, and kirsch custard) So fresh, so good. And my other personal favorite, the \"Opera\"--this cake is dense and packed with flavor. It is made of up hazelnut sponge cake, chocolate truffle filling, mocha praline and covered in chocolate ganache with toasted almonds. SO good. \n\nHope all that information helped. They have so much more on their website and the best thing is, you can order online, over the phone, or in person. Enjoy and create great memories for yourself!", "author": "Lorraine C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "If I could actually afford it, I would have a fake wedding just so I could justify ordering a ten-tiered cake. Each tier would be one of the luscious yet light-tasting cake flavors at Schubert's such as tiramisu, double chocolate mousse, mango mousse, and princess. Now I'm sure there are more than 10 flavors but I figure asking for a cake with a tier for each of their flavors will seem excessive. Ten just sounds justifiable. \n\nBack to the fake wedding planning. I would order the cake from Schubert's, stuff all the fake wedding guests all to the brim with the actual dinner so that people just can't stomach another bite and leave early, wait 6 hours after dinner to serve the cake so the remaining people think there isn't cake, and then voila, 10-layer cake is all to myself. \n\nNow I realize that you may be thinking that perhaps I'll be sick of cake after finishing off 2 layers. That you're wrong because with Schubert's cakes - any of their cake flavors - I'll make room. I will starve for 5 days if that's what it takes. I will run...err walk slowly...a marathon. There is no such thing as too much Schubert's just as there is no such thing as too many pairs of shoes for women. And because their cakes don't taste too sweet - just the right amount of sweetness - I won't have to worry about popping diabetic medication to go through the wedding cake.\n\nSchubert's is also kind enough to realize such a plan may not work for every cake lover so instead, it also makes miniature sizes of its cakes. Prices are reasonable, which makes any plot to cake hog more viable. Remember this place is on Clement and 6th Street so you'll have to be mentally prepared for parking to get in between you and their cakes.", "author": "Gwen L."}

I have tried many bakeries and have yet to find one that compares to Schubert's. Every cake that I've tried I have fallen in love with. Somehow, they just get it right all the time. My mom has also fallen in love with their cakes and she DOES not like Sweets which I believe is a true testament showing how tasty their cakes are! This place has become the go to place for my family whether its a birthday or we just want cake. \n\nThe presentation of their cakes are very elaborate and decorative. They use fruits, lady fingers, ribbons, chocolate dipped strawberries, etc. Presentation probably makes the cake taste better too!!! Honestly, its worth the price for their cakes; 8\" for give or take $26.95 and 10\" for give or take $36.95. I have paid a lot more and have received a lot less. I can't stress how much I love this place! \n\nThe service has its up and downs, hence, the 4 stars. Sometimes, it can be slow. But, I love this place so much I wouldn't let that discourage me from their bakery goods. I do wish they opened later....\n\nI would recommend... \n\n1.) Tiramisu (My all time favorite.)\n2.)

Their cake is light and delicious, and seeing that our wedding banquet was a 10 course Chinese meal with 2 desserts, we also went with Schubert's. We chose the mango mousse cake. It was not too sweet, and light enough so that our guests would be able to somehow get the cake into their mouths.\n\nIt was easy to work with Schubert's. We had booked a tasting almost 6 months in advance, was advised that we can look at the portfolio online, and they also gave us their portfolio to look at in the store. It was fun doing the tasting, and I had narrowed it down to the mango and the guava (which is a little bit sweeter than the mango, but it's so good!)  I almost went with guava because I had wanted to be different, but my Tony warned that guava may be too different and too much for our traditional relatives. So we opted for the safer mango flavor. \n\nOn the day of my event, the cake delivery folk arrived promptly on time. And the cake was a hit.  It was definitely very easy and stress free working with Schubert's.", "author": "Annie Y."}

But It is, and not just because of its fat and sugar content, totally compelling.\n\nTake their eclairs, for example. I prefer them to other eclairs, but can't point out why, exactly. I know that the pate choux (the puffy pastry) is made correctly, because its a little crunchy on the outside and very airy inside. But I love them almost more because of the foolishness of putting both whipped cream and pastry cream in the filling. Most places just put whipped cream inside and call it a day.

Even if you took the day of your birthday off, they would still make you \"celebrate\" it the day before or even a few weeks afterwards.

Margie was an insane nurse practitioner who also happened to be an SF native.

We are all birthday cake connoisseurs considering how many birthday parties we have each year and all the different bakeries we have tried through the years (Chinese bakery fruit cakes, ice cream cakes, The Cakery, Sheng Kee, etc. etc.) \n\nThe cake itself was moist and soft, almost angel-cake like in texture.  The filling was heavenly - strawberries and custard...yummers!  And it was awesome how much chocolate shavings they put on top of the cake for decoration.  The combination of the cake, the filling and the shaved chocolate just made a delicious mouthful.  \n\nPrices here are also pretty reasonable.  We ordered the half sheet, and it more than fed the 40 guests we had.  It probably came to $2 a head, which is really reasonable.  We even had a small 5\" square piece leftover- man, that made for awesome dessert/midnight snack the next day.  \n\nIn any case, I'm looking forward to going back and trying out more of their delicious-sounding cakes.

It was super cute and very pink. Luckily he is very secure guy so he didn't mind the pink cake, especially since it was delicious. The way I would describe it is the perfect balance between a chinese cake and a western cake.

Their cakes were both rich but in a good way =)\n\nWe sat down in the store to eat the cakes and it was such a delightful dining experience. Whilst eating we got to admire all the other options we could try next time. The interior of the store had some really cute artwork such as the perodic table of cakes. \n\nDefinitely worth spending a little more money on Schubert's cakes!", "author": "Chloe C."}

I know it sounds crazy, but think about it: at 8:30 am on Saturdays, you don't have to feed the meters, fight the crowds or wait in line.\n\nSometimes, I come here before breakfast at my Mom and Dad's.  I pick up some raspberry, apricot and plain croissants and \"surprise\" my parents.  The pastries are incredibly fresh and practically melt in your mouth.  The prices are a bit steep by the Richmond standards, but the pastries are totally worth it.\n\nFor special occasions, I always pick up a cake from Schubert's.  The cakes look more expensive than they really are, and you can give your suburban friends a truly jaw-dropping experience.  Comments such as \"Aww, you shouldn't have,\" \"How much did THAT cost you???\" and \"You have GOT to tell me where you got this cake from\" are very common.\n\nI strongly recommend a tiramisu cake or a strawberry/raspberry mousse cake.  They're moist, light and, forgive the cliche, \"sinfully delicious.\"  All cakes are beautifully decorated with chocolate shavings, bonbons, strawberries, etc.  Schubert's will gladly write your message in frosting on a piece of chocolate and place it tastefully right on your cake.  Whether you're saying \"Happy Birthday,\" \"Will you marry me?\" \"I think we should see other people\" or \"Sorry I ran over your dog,\" your message will look and taste beautiful.\n\nI am not a fan of their Opera cake (it's just too rich for me) or their cheesecake (it doesn't really taste like a cheesecake should), but everything else is absolutely great.  Try it, and I guarantee you'll be hooked on Schubert's.\n\nMust . . . have . . . more . . . cake!", "author": "Yan G."}

OMG. The display case is filled up with GORGEOUS cakes. They are not the sponge cake with frosting that you get from Safeway. The are more like, say, your wedding cakes. They are absolutely gorgeous, and I'm sure they taste just as great as they look, judging from the small pastries that I've tried.\n\nI don't know how much truth is there in the \"authentic viennese\" part, but I do find the croissants of very high quality, almost as good as Tartine. The apple croissant looked the least appealing to me, but somehow I got it. After taking a couple of bites in the car, had to put it away so I couldn't finish the entire (big) thing. The next evening, took another bit, it was almost just as good as about 35 hours after I bought it, which is pretty amazing. Croissants usually get stale very soon, even the ones from Tartine. The apple filling has a very good balance between tartness, sweetness, and spiciness. \n\nWill definitely keep coming back and trying new things. Most pastries are $3.50 (ish).

I didn't know what kind of design I wanted, all knew was that I wanted my cake from Schubert. With all the great reviews from Yelp, I knew I couldn't go wrong.  We went for a cake tasting and I put down my deposit on the spot.  We went for an alternating layer. One layer, we went for a yellow cake with kirsch custard and strawberry filling. The other, chocolate cake with rum and raspberry filling.  The girl who helped us was really nice and answered all our questions.  I was a bit reluctant to have a fondant overlay since I was so use to butter cream and whipped cream...but the cakes with fondant looked so pretty. Initially I thought they would end up charging an additional cost depending on the design because a lot of places do base the cost on the design of the cake.  And there was no way I was going to pay over a grand for a wedding cake. To our surprise the girl who was helping us said we could bring any design and the bakery chef would work off it at no additional cost. Yay...I score once again. First with wedding dress and now the cake. I love being a bargain hunter.  It's the Asian blood in me.\n\nSchubert's portfolio didn't exactly do them justice..perhaps due to copyrights?? They didn't want to be sued for taking someone's design??  Anyhow, I found this cake design and asked if it was doable. And so the bakery chef said no problem.  Was I taking a chance?? Yeah, I was...but I trusted them completely. Excitement built and couldn't wait to see our wedding cake.  \n\nOn our wedding day.. oohh..the cake was so pretty.  Prettier than I imagined.. =).

He thought we'd get a good deal, and he was right.  Yelp just reaffirmed what we were thinking.\n\nFor regular pricing:  four tiers ($660), plus delivery to Napa ($140) to feed over 200 guests = less than $4 per person.  Sweet!  \n\nFor a point of reference:  Our other two vendors were charging $10+ for the same thing.  Then again, one is the exclusive bakery for The Ritz Carlton, HMB and the other previously won a Food Network baking competition.\n\nThe fruity fillings were too tart for our taste, so we went with two layers Opera cake (hazelnut sponge with chocolate truffle and mocha praline filling topped with toasted almonds).

This year my boyfriend ordered 3 bday cakes:  mango cheesecake, strawberrry cheesecake, and chocolate mousse.  They were all EXCELLENT and looked beautiful.  I highly recommend this place.   I brought the leftover cake to work and they were gone almost before I sat them down - GREAT STUFF PEOPLE!  \n\nI love that you can order your cakes online (especially if you have a difficult to spell message).  I HATE how you have to pick them up!  It's always crowded and the counter is a little bit of a \"free for all.\"  I'd been waiting 5 minutes while the clerks helped other customers.  This woman walks in, elbows her way next to me, and when the clerk walks up and says \"next!\" she says \"oh me!\"  I politely said (in my most territorial tone) \"Oh no, I'm sorry, you just walked in and everyone else has been waiting.  I was next.\"  and put my purse in front of her face on the counter.  (Oh come on, she deserved it!)  The clerk smiled and took my name to get my order.  Just had to add that to the review - be prepared to affirm your place in \"line!\"  Muhahahaha!", "author": "Silly P."}

A variety of flavorful and creative cakes, some decorated with different chocolates in different forms (dark, white, roll logs, shavings, bars, etc).\n\nMy favorite is their mango mousse cake!! And those are trimmed with chocolates too. There's a good selection of cakes and pastries. They even have a web site where you can pick your cake and size.\n\nThey're only kind of pricey. So I go their for special birthday cakes and occasions. And parking during the day and weekends can be tough.\n\nOnly one Schubert and they've been around for many, many years.

I particularly love old school cakes with lots of cream, chocolate, sponge, mousses, etc.   The first time I ever went into Merritt Bakery I almost died of happiness. . . until I tasted the goods and was overwhelmed by the taste of pure chemicals in the sub-par ingredients.  I shied away from Old Lady Cakes after that because I was scared.  \n\nThe other day I was craving Old Lady Cake fiercely and was with a friend who lives in the city - I promised him a ride home if he'd come with me to Schubert's.  I had it in my head that I had never been there.  Of course, once we passed the threshold, I realized that I had been there before WAAAAAY back in the day with my abuelita to pick up some sugar cookies for \"the nuns\" (cloistered nuns who to this day live in a big convent across the street from my mom's).  Anyhoo, I was interested in some black forest cake and perhaps a slice of princess cake. . . princess cake is somewhat of an anomaly for me as one of my biggest mentors loves it so and I have yet to understand why.  Enter Schubert's. . . they do princess cake right.  Soft sponge, creamy center, thin layer of raspberry jam, crispy cookie layer on the bottom. . .and green MARZIPAN, not nasty ol' fondant, enrobes the little slice of sweetness.  I finally could understand my mentor's love of Princess Cake!  I also ended up with a slice of Black Forest, a mini-Chocolate Mousse Cake and a piece of Opera Cake.  What?  I had driven ALL THE WAY from Oakland. . . you know that I not about to leave with one paltry piece of cake!  \n\nThe Black Forest was good but I am not a big fan of boozy desserts.  . . I like my booze neat, not in my sweets so that and the Princess cake had a little too much kirsch and kirschwasser for my taste.  My dream would be to have a custom Princess cake with no kirsch in it. . .OH YEAH!!!  The chocolate mousse was creamy and moussey and chocolaty with nary a hint of chemical warfare.  The Opera Cake was my favorite. . my only quibble would be that the toasted almonds that adorn the outside should be toasted hazelnuts but that's just me being picky and pastryqueen-ish.  \n\nI didn't really notice how much things cost - I think I found the prices fair for what I got. . I will fully admit that my mind gets foggy in the presence of so many baked goods.\n\nAlso, I can neither confirm nor deny that I went to Schubert's today to get LouLou a slice of Princess Cake for her 3rd birthday.  Nor can I confirm or deny that little birthday pit bulls really like green marzipan.  :)", "author": "Lainie L."}

When I'm back home from the East Coast and there's a birthday that needs a cake, you can be sure to find me picking it up at Schubert's. \n\nThe favorite cakes that I've had from here include, but are not limited to: the Swedish Princess Cake, any and all of the mousse cakes (mango mousse is my *favorite*!), the fruit basket cake, strawberry shortcake, and the tiramisu. \n\nThe Swedish Princess cake here is so amazing. I usually don't really like the layer of marzipan on the outside of princess cakes, but I like the marzipan here and the way it compliments the raspberry and custard fillings on the inside. The cake is so light and moist -- I could probably eat it all day. \n\nSchubert's mango mousse is the best mango mousse ever -- that mousse layer is just to die for. It's not too sweet, either, for those of you who are weary about mousses being an overkill on the tooth. \n\nAnother thing about the cakes and pretty much all the desserts here is that they're always decorated so beautifully.

However, as a picky bride, I must explain that Schubert's lost a star because my instructions were for them to make the decoration on the cake \"red\" (not sure what would be confusing about that) to match our wedding colors and instead the cake ended up being decorated with a bright blue (robin's egg blue) band around each tier.  Obviously it didn't ruin my wedding or anything, but I thought that the random color choice was odd and no where in the instructions did it say anything about blue.  \n\nSo!

I had no idea how good this place was, so my girl decided to bring me. I ordered the Strawberry shortcake and a mixed fruit tart. After an hour of having the food inside my car (running other errands), we finally had time to sit down and eat. The fork sliced through the shortcake like a hot knife on butter. And the taste of the shortcake was absolutely delicious. I decided to hold off on the fruit tart, as the taste of the shortcake was already a pleaser, but I can already tell the fruit tart will be just as tasteful (as I'm typing this, my mouth is drooling thinking about the tart).\n\nThis bakery is full of cakes, tarts, shortcakes, and many other desserts that are sure to please the taste buds on any occasion and at a very reasonable price. Would I come back here? Oh, you bet I do. Now, if only they made cream puffs (the kind Beard Papa makes too) this place would be an end all bakery spot to go.", "author": "Michael S."}

At that time, they said our date was book already but to try and call the store manager. When I called and talked with the store manager, I told him about not being able to get through right away. And since we live in the south bay, we had to wait until our free weekend to go in store. \n\nThe store manager was wonderfully accommodating and said that he would squeeze us in even though they were book. From there on, the process went so smoothly. We scheduled and went in for our tasting (which was so fun & delicious). We ordered a 3 tier square cake + sheet cake for a reasonable price. We described what we wanted & it was truly everything that we wanted for our cake. So beautiful, elegant & most importantly delivered on time- we loved it!

My boyfriend buys me a birthday cake here every year! They also sell most of their cake in little mini version as well. Although it is on the more pricier side, it's worth it! I live across the city and decided to drive 25 mins out here because I was craving. When I came in around 11:30 a.m, I knew I wanted to purchase a 6 inch. However, I didn't see it so I asked the chubby face Caucasian sales woman. She just briefly said no we are all sold out. Curious, I asked will you have them later in the day and she just blurbed out I am not sure with quite an attitude. So I asked well, can you find out whenever you can? And she replied \" I'm helping someone else right now\". Yah I know I can see. So I asked another salesgirl and she went to check for me and they had it!

I have a chonic sweet tooth and had just spent two weeks in Berlin, doing Kaffee und Kuchen every day, so I was in need of a fix. I picked up four individual cakelets/slices - a Napoleon, a Princess cake slice, a strawberry mousse & a raspberry/white chocolate mousse.\n\nAfter riding the #22 home and brewing some fresh coffee, I opened up the box and to my great disappointment found a mess. The cakes were so poorly packed that they'd all toppled over. I'd been careful to keep the box level all the way home, so it wasn't due to me swinging the box like a loony.\n\nWhilst the cakes are lovely to look at, as far as the tastes and textures go...entirely forgettable, bog-standard fare. I could have cried. The strawberry mousse was probably the most disappointing...the sponge was on the dry side and the mousse had no substance to it and barely tastes of strawberry...I'm thinking maybe they just wafted some strawberries over the mixture, rather than actualluy adding it.\n\nIf I lived in the Inner Richmond, I'd likely go back...as I don't, I won't.

The creamy layer of the Princess Cake tastes of *freshly* whipped cream. Best of all no shortening residue on my palate after eating a butter cookie, pastry or frosted cake.  They use butter.  Never too much of anything, though.\n\nTheir cake selection is well beyond my repertoire, everything I have tried here is top of the line.  they also package their cookies into great gift bags & have individual mini-cake versions of many of their grande tortes.\n\nThis is a no-nonsense type of bakery not a \"scene\" unless you're one of the cute older ladies and men who come here to drink coffee and (presumably) gossip; it gets crowded on the weekends.

In fact, its price is a bit lower than the most of bakeries. Schubert cakes are freshly made daily. The overnight / a-day old cake will be identified and priced lower. Honest business, I like that. I am happy to see Schubert is doing well and more people enjoy its creations. My favorites are its mango moose, chocolate moose, and two-layer chocolate cake.", "author": "April W."}

This store has been here since Margaret's childhood at least, and I used to visit frequently in the 80s.  Although it has turned over -- look behind the counter -- the recipes have done well under the current owners.  We drop in from time to time for coffee and the little pastries in the display.  My favorite today was the fresh fruit cup, although I have been known to order most of the mousse selections.  Today the clerk serving us spaced out and forgot he was working, but all's well that ends well.  The treats are first class, and the eclairs are terrific.

It's really more about service for me than anything else. The cakes at this place are good, but they taste disgusting for someone like me who has been treated like crap when I walked in. \n\nWhat I will NOT give the benefit of the doubt is one instance in which I walked in and was completely ignored by the person behind the counter as she helped every single person who walked in behind me for the next 10 minutes. It was like I didn't exist. I said \"excuse me\" a lot and was just standing there but she totally ignored me and was greeting the person behind me. Granted, I don't look like a serial killer.. I think I actually look like a fairly nice person. Then another person came out from behind the kitchen, this older Asian lady..by this time I was fairly frustrated, and I was like \"excuse me..I haven't been helped for the last 10 minutes..\" and she pretty much said with some crazy attitude..that well, it's not HER fault because she just came out from the kitchen. So.. imagine me, after being frustrated and pissed off after a good amount of time of being completely ignored and treated like I don't exist...and then receiving that kind of attitude when someone finally \"greets\" me...well, it was the final straw. I turned round on my heel and left. Now everytime, I see a cake from Schubert's, I kind of want to throw up. Completely unacceptable service. \n\nI'm in the service business and I realize that no matter who your customer is..whether they're tall or short, young or old, look rich or poor, black or white.. it don't matter, you're supposed to treat them well and show them that you're ready to help. It's what service is. I absolutely did not feel like this place deserved my business, no matter how yummy their cakes are, and I have not been back since.

For my friend's graduation this year, we got an Opera cake, which is chocolate with nuts and everything. It reminds me of a cake version of a Ferrero Rocher; it's very rich and instead of cream to layer the cake, its layered with chocolate. They also have tiny cakes to try. We had the current mousse cake, which is a bit tart and also the mango cheesecake, which doesn't really taste like a traditional cheesecake. I think it tastes better and I've been missing out on the cheesecake all these years.

We had been looking forward to our appointment since we have always loved their cakes/cupcakes, etc. \nwhen we arrived for our appointment, we were quickly seated at the table next to the counter, however then we had to wait for someone to come meet with us, finally one of the workers came by, gave us a list of the available flavors along with the pricing list and instructed us to pick 3 flavors, then left again. Returned after ~ 5min, took our requests, then was gone again. Finally she sat down with us and after asking us a few general questions for contact info and then after we gave her our wedding date, she replied \"oh, i've already had 4 other couples come in today with that same wedding day, you'll have to make a decision soon because we only take 6 reseverations\" She answered a few of my questions and then left again...returned later with 3 small pieces of cake in the flavors we had chosen, and by small, I mean, each piece only allowed my fiance and I to take 1 bite each. Basically, after that, she just handed me the papers and said \"when you decide to come back, just bring this with you\" \nI pretty much decided on the spot that we would not be returning here for our wedding cake since I was so annoyed by then.

The line starts at the register, at the back of the store. That's where the friendly and helpful clerks will be calling for the next customer.

Standing 7ft away by the cakes-by-the-slice or milling back and forth between that and the pastry case - that's NOT establishing your next place in line. \r\nSorry if that sounds harsh, but I got a mocha torte (which I ordered over the phone) to pick up, and I won't have my time wasted by the indecisive.", "author": "CINDY K."}

Staff are unable to speak English properly and behaviour may be cultural but comes across as rude and are very impatient to get to the next customer.\n2. This is not a European bakery although the presentation looks similar - walks like a duck, talks like a duck but it isn't a duck!\n3. Found a long hair in an item that was bought  - this could happen but it turns you off.\n\nTartine has its shortcomings, but for me their quality is more European and worth the wait and price if I am craving a particular pastry.", "author": "Katy B."}

The writing for the message is done on white chocolate so you don't have to worry about it smearing all over the cake.

I guess it was either super busy or nobody felt like picking up the phone.   When I picked up the cake, I also happened to drop it on my way out.  (It fell straight down) The cashier that rang it up for me helped me replace the flowers that cracked and the cake looked as good as new.  Hehe.

It's very light, and smooth, and the sweetness of the strawberry flavor is just enough to give you a delicious sugar rush.

My grandmother loves to pick up desserts from here every once in awhile.  The little fruit tarts are so cute and yummy.  A definite must try for everyone.  They are of the perfect size and the fruit is always so sweet.  The mini mousse cakes are also very rich in flavor for something so small in size!!  I'm not a real big cake fan but these are just the right size so that I won't get sick of it.  We also get the personalized larger cakes which are very nice to look at.  If you ever need to impress with a unique cake- try this!!  We often have the Chocolate Truffle Torte (because my dad LOVES chocolate) but sometimes it's TOO chocolaty for my taste.  I usually have to have a glass of milk even with a sliver of the cake, but if you are a chocolate cake, this is the one for you.  Another favorite is the Tiramisu Mousse, which looked so appealing to a waiter at the restaurant we brought it to, that he asked for a piece.

She was hoping for a tiramisu but that was not available. It was not after we sat down at a table did I notice that they had their cheesecakes on the opposite side from which we stood and ordered so I did not see them. The tropical mousse did taste like mango and it did taste better than the lemon which was sour. I myself did not enjoy my tropical mousse too much. I thought it was ok.

We decided on the tiramisu mousse 'cause some people don't really like chocolate cake (it's bizarre!). \n\nAnyhow, I had to wake up super early to pick it up since I was going to see him later in the morning, so I really appreciated the fact that they open at 7. The box was pretty hefty and the design was absolutely beautiful. I didn't have my camera on me so once I gave him the box, he started picking at it. *sigh* By the time other people came to see the cake, it was already missing some vital pieces of chocolate. \n\nEveryone loved the cake. It was light and tasty and even my friend, who's no fan of tiramisu, ate some. Next time I think I'm going to go for the Swedish Princess. \n\nThe only con is that I have to drive twenty some minutes to get to the place, but believe me, it's worth it.", "author": "Connie J."}

This place saved me when I needed to bring something to our work potluck for the 4th, and a fruit torte it was.  Very good, and reasonably priced!  Today, I got the princess cake to share with another group, and thankfully, it was a huge hit!  I was hesitant at first to purchase it, thinking it would be too sweet or heavy, but it looked and tasted wonderful.  I'm not much of cake person, so I was there for 20 minutes trying to decide what to purchase.  The lady at the counter was so patient with me...they must encounter that numerous times daily, but everything looks so tempting, it's difficult to choose.  \n\nBest chocolate croissant I've had, ever.  And cheap.  I usually pay more for dry croissants.  \n\nNext on the list, I'm going to try a mousse cake.  Or maybe I'll bring that to the next work potluck.  \n\nYou would never expect this bakery to be in the middle of all the Asian places on Clement.", "author": "Christine H."}

Today was a huge disappointment. We walked in for a cake tasting on time. There was a huge crowd of people around the case, all waiting to take something or other out. We were told to take a seat at an empty table and someone will be with us. Not a big deal. We sat down and waited. Ten minutes passed, and we were offered coffee. That was really nice of them - we accepted and the coffee came with the wedding cake book. We were told to look through and get some ideas for cake decorations. Everything in their book was covered with fondant. We are not fondant people, and we thought to ask about buttercream instead. Ten more minutes pass and nothing. Another ten, and someone else came by asking if we knew which flavors we wanted to try. Uh, noooo because we don't know what flavors you're offering. We finally got a menu. We picked our three flavors and waited. And waited. And waited some more. They were accommodating and gave us a little bit of fondant to sample - not being big fondant people, we wanted to make sure we didn't mind covering an entire wedding cake in the foul stuff. They use one that is marshmallow-like in flavor and satiny smooth in texture. But man, oh man, did the cake samples suck. The chocolate with vanilla cream filling didn't taste like either chocolate or vanilla. It was wet, not moist. The yellow cake was dry as sawdust and could have used some of the moisture form the flavorless chocolate cake. The strawberry filling tasted like strawberry jam out of a jar. I would not have been surprised to find a huge jar of Smucker's in the back. And the Swedish princess sample was just not that good. Overall, the experience was blah. Turns out the fondant was the best part of the whole appointment, which really is a shame. The extra star is for their ready-made cakes. I would not hesitate to grab a chocolate mousse cake next time I'm in the area and headed to a birthday party or a get-together at a friend's home.", "author": "Vania M."}

I am very serious about cake, especially the quality of the cream, and would gladly admit if somebody had a better cake. However, of all the cakes I had at weddings (none of which were from Schubert's), ours really was superior thanks to Schubert's. It was light, fluffy, not too sweet, not too heavy, and best of all, they didn't go crazy with the butter cream filling. We actually ate the top part, which is supposed to be frozen until the 1 year anniversary, the very next after the wedding. Is that bad luck? You can't be called unlucky with a mouthful of delicious mango mousse cream!\n Their prices were fair considering the quality. They made us a cake shaped like stacked luggage. Our guests were amazed at the presentation, as were we. They also delivered right when they promised they would. I only found out later that in the process, they smashed our cake topper.

Whether you try to decide upon a mango, tropical fruit, current or chocolate mouse cake, these cakes are rich, light airy and fully of flavor.  The cakes are moist and are really pretty!  If mousse cakes aren't your thing, they have whipped cream cakes, buttercream cakes, fruit tortes, cheesecakes and even pastries!  Prices on the mousse cakes are pretty good value as well, I am normally not a big fan on the mousse cakes from certain bakeries in the past, they were expensive for what they were and to be honest I never really cared for them.  (WARNING, mathematic figures to follow...)  That said these seem much more flavorful, and what I was surprised by was that upon cutting into the cake usually the ratio of mousse to cake is usually 50/50.  Cutting into their mousse cake I was surprised to see 80/20 mousse to cake ratio.  More mousse means more of it per bite and to someone with such a severe sweet tooth that is a good thing!  Parking is very slim here, generally tons of luck and patience is needed to find a parking spot on this street, and it is metered.  Fortunately people here work quick so you could run in get your cake and be out in minutes, but I by no means am advocating double parking, that said having a friend who you can bribe with sweets to circle the block while you shop is also a good way to get the job done.  They will personalize the cakes as well for birthday wishes, work functions and whatever holiday/event you wish to celebrate!

However, I soon found Schubert's and rejoiced the moment I stepped in the door of their Richmond bakery to the sight of dozens of immaculately prepared desserts, among them the SPC.    One bite and I knew that they too had mastered the art of SPC-production.  The cake had the same great flavors and textures as the SPC's I had grown up on.

Having moved to the Bay area over ten years ago, from Tahiti (a French influenced island), I was really searching for exquisite-genuine-tasting French pastries.  As I have been spoiled eating refined French patisserie growing up there .  I tried many places in San Francisco and have been disappointed over and over again until I found Schubert's Bakery smacked right in the \"Asian\" neighborhood of the inner Richmond on Clement street.  I have never ventured to any other bakery shops ever since I found this place whether it's to grab a simple almond croissant (I love their blueberry turnover and custard croissant too) for breakfast or ordering any cakes/tarts for special occasions.  The service has always been amicable and helpful.  You really can't go wrong with your purchase here.", "author": "Nadine M."}

But then my husband got a pastry that was filled with apple pie type filling. It was good, but there wasn't very much of the filling in it. I wouldn't say it was as good as mine taste-wise either.

So here I am asking about what her favorite treat is, and she couldn't even tell me.  She said, 'whatever you like'.  Well, it was my first time there, and I just wasnt sure.  They have chocolate, cheesecake, moousse, shortcake.  If it's texture that you are looking for, this place has got it.  The mousse is so light it floats on your tongue.  It doesn't even seem like you are sinfully eating such decadence.  I didn't get to try the strawberry shortcake, though the gal sitting next to us said it was like heaven in your mouth. mmm.

I even received a thank you from the owner, Ralph, for posting such a great review for his bakery on yelp.  He even told me to ask for him directly next time I needed to order a cake.  So, naturally, I thought I would send my neice to order her cake from here knowing that she would get a great deal and excellent service.  Unfortunately, her experience with Schubert's bakery was not as appealing.  She tried to contact Ralph on a daily basis and was always given an excuse that he couldn't come to the phone. She left several messages, no returned calls.  After two weeks of trying to get a hold of Ralph, she finally decided to speak to another baker, which gave her a high quote for a cake...nowhere as good as the price I received.  Here I am referring someone to a bakery I trusted would deliver on service and prices, but I was extremely disappointed how my neice was treated.  Needless to say, I would not be referring anyone else to this bakery.  I feel a bit jipped and mislead that my future orders from here would be the same as my first...WRONG! I return to a business as a paying customer  not only because of customer service and products, but also for their business ethics. Schubert's bakery is lacking in this area and I'm quite disappointed. Obviously won't be coming back here again.", "author": "Live Love L."}
