The owner, chef, server is all one man, who was charming, attentive, and he's a really good cook.\n\nWe started off with the fois gras, caprese salad and carrot soup.  The fois gras was some of the best I've ever had, and I've had it in France.  The homemade cheese in the caprese salad was perfect.  Slightly salty, creamy inside and firm on the outside.  Then we shared the beef daube with pasta.  The meat was cooked to perfection, it melted in your mouth.  For desert we had the Fondant au chocolat.\n\nWe are looking forward to our next visit.

What more can one ask for?\n\n(Probably a lot actually... but let's just go with it haha.)\n\nI had made reservations for 7:00pm on Valentine's Day, and I was a little nervous about the night as my choice the year before ended up feeling like lining up for TSA security, being violated a little, and then being left a little confused and wondering why we signed up for this as we put our shoes back on.\n\nCastagna was so much better!! We were cheerfully welcomed (because we had reservations haha) and were given complimentary champagne and salmon cream bites while they prepared our table. While waiting, we noticed that the bar seating had a really great view of the kitchen - and being a wannabe-chef, I asked if we could sit at the bar and have personal attention and glorious food views.\n\nShe said yes ;)\n\nSo she went with the prix fixe of the mushroom soup + scallops, and I went with the standard filet mignon with fries. We also would get a bottle of champagne (the chef went, \"...? .... Let's do this!\") and the Tarte Tatin - which is like fancy apple pie. And here we go with food!\n\nMUSHROOM SOUP\nCreamy mushroom soup! Everything you would expect, done in a very reliable fashion. Our soup was a teensy-bit on the lukewarm side, but I try not to be too hard on a super busy Valentine's Day :) On a sidenote, the bread is really good too!\n\nSCALLOPS\nSo I actually can't eat scallops due to allergies, but I heard it was really good (it definitely looked magnificent!) and is worth getting again. With everything else so good, I would imagine this was correct :)\n\nFILET MIGNON\nHonestly, Castagna's version has become one of my favorite steaks (if not, my actual favorite). The flavor is really satisfying yet clean, and the bites just melt in your mouth. The crust could be a little thicker/crunchier (then I would probably be broke... and fat.... but happy!), but it's simply amazing. Better than my experiences at Ruth's Chris and even Alexander's (though not by much on this one haha)!\n\nTARTE TATIN\nI love apple pie, and we didn't know how this would turn out. But it had baked apples so how could we go wrong? I know most people probably go for the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and I'm sure it's probably fantastic here - I guess I prefer fruit and sorbets over caramels and creams (but I'll get it next time!). The tarte tatin had really rich flavor, sweet but not overly so, and was a perfect ending for the meal.\n\nSo the place is definitely on the small side (so make your reservations if you can), and parking in the area isn't the best (though we used a nearby $3/hr garage which isn't too bad), but you definitely owe to yourself to stop by Castagna and visit Chef St\u00e9phane! It's won awards, is the favorite  restaurant of many fellow Yelpers, and you're going to see why so many regulars keep coming back :)\n\nThanks again for a wonderful evening, and see you next time for lasagna!!", "author": "Greg G."}

Not only that, St\u00e9phane was very accommodating and welcoming towards my nephew who is autistic. He sat us where my nephew would be comfortable and gave us fries (the nephew's fave) quickly. For me, it was very heartwarming. I always love supporting restaurants who accommodate families with special children/people. \n\nI highly suggest making a reservation - the place is tiny but cute inside. It's not your typical dark wanting to be romantic French place. It's actually very inviting and a nice balance lighting. \n\nWe ended up ordering a few dishes since it was our first big meal after breakfast. The sis ordered a cheese plate and Marguerita pizza as our starters. The pizza was thin crust and it was awesome! The right amount of crispiness as well as flavor. For my main, I ordered a lasagna - which, unfortunately, I wasn't able to fully enjoy since it was hella hot.

We immediately felt welcomed and I knew right away that it was going to be an amazing experience. \n\nWe started off by ordering a bottle of wine, our servers recommendation and it was fabulous.  We also got a french onion soup to share. It was bubbly, hot, cheesy. Everything you could want in french onion soup. It's worth mentioning that the french bread that was served at the table was delicious and warm and was the perfect vessel to sop up every last drop of the soup. For my main course, I got a pasta dish (new to the menu so it's not online yet and I don't remember what it was called) but it was amazing! White sauce pasta with prosciutto and a piece of fried prosciutto on top - creamy, rich and delicious. My boyfriend got the lasagne. All I can say about it is WOW. Probably the best lasagne I've had. I would definitely order both dishes again.  We polished off both plates and proceeded to order creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for dessert.

Of course, a lot of the brunch places around Marina District were super packed, but I found a nice little French bistro to enjoy a meal. It seemed that I was the first to dine this morning, and so I had the whole restaurant to myself for a little bit, before others started rolling in. \n\nThese were baked eggs with cr\u00eame fraiche (shame on me and all 12 years of French I studied - didn't know that was sour cream haha), with a side of potatoes and lightly dressed salad. I went for the baked eggs in the spirit of trying new things/not being boring old Croque Madame, which is what I was debating between. The potatoes were definitely excellent. The crispy coating seemed to be executed with great care, as it was extremely even all the way around. \n\nI also ordered a mimosa because why not XD I think the server thought it was a bit curious that I was having a mimosa, also considering I was having brunch with me, myself, and I hehe. I've actually never tried a mimosa before, so this was my first. I just don't think I like alcohol, because I wished it was more orange juice than champagne. I guess I'll just stick with juice next time haha. Oh well, it's all about trying new things right? :)\n\nSince I sat facing the window, I noticed a couple posters that mentioned the chef was featured in Grocery Games, which was pretty cool.

Contrary to what most other reviewers have reported on, unfortunately my experience was pretty lackluster. Not sure this place really lives up to the hype.\n\nThe menu is very carb heavy, including entrees like pizza, pasta, etc. They seem to be well known for their pasta here, so maybe my friend and I just happened to order the wrong dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-31", "description": "I would have given this 1 star because of the poor service we received, but to be fair, the food was ok enough to bump it up to 2 stars. So let's start there. My wife and I got:\n- Mussels: Best dish we had at Castagna. While the mussels were a tad smaller than we like and a few of them were a bit rubber-y, overall this was a good dish because (1) the amount of mussels for the price they charged was fair; but more significantly (2) because the sauce was outstanding. Just the right amount so that it didn't overpower the mussels but enhanced them with the great flavour (we actually ended up treating the sauce like a 'soup', just having it by itself)\n- Lasagna: When a restaurant slaps on a \"grandmother recipe\" label on one of its dishes, I'm automatically getting it. This one was ok, though it didn't live up to the expectations that the label brings. The lasagna meat and noodles were generically good, but I liked the cheese the most - crisped nicely so that it complemented the good helping of sauce.\n- Seafood pasta: Just ok. Fair helping of seafood, good pasta firmness, but sauce was just a bit bland for me.\n\nSo overall, the food was ok - I've had better, I've had worse. I'd probably give Catagna 3 stars if i based it solely on this. But because of the service, I am downgrading the overall rating. The service we received was really bad:\n- Slow: We waited for 45 minutes before we got anything (not even complimentary bread, let alone the actual appetizers/mains we ordered)... and this is after we had told one of the servers to bring the food as they were ready. \n- A bit forgetful: My wife had to remind them to bring the rose she ordered, and that didn't get to her till after we started eating. \n- Rude: One of our friends wrote a review on Yelp while we were at the restaurant. Now whether you agree with this practice or not is not the point here. Because as we were paying the bill, the manager/owner(?) came to our table and just bluntly asked if we had a problem. We were confused since it was abrupt and we were in the middle of conversations, and I guess he saw the look on our faces because he then proceeded to ask \"Is there a ___ at this table?\" After we pointed to our friend, he then took out his phone and showed us the review our friend had just made. Now the act of getting immediate feedback from your customers (whether they are satisfied/dissatisfied) is not bad, and in fact could be a sign of great customer service. But he went about it in such an abrasive manner, and rather than asking us what was wrong with the meal/experience in a tone which showed openness to feedback, he was very defensive and kept trying to justify their poor service. To be fair, he did end the conversation by offering dessert/drinks on the house, but at that point we had lost our appetites... and it wasn't because of the food we just had.\n\nI know there are a lot of good reviews here for Castagna so I'll just say this: You can say we have different tastes and not trust my take on it's food. You can say maybe things were busy and maybe 45 minutes isn't a long time to wait for any food to come, so can chalk up the slow service to an off-day or personal timing expectations. But you can't say that customers don't deserve a certain level of respect from the restaurants they frequent. That, more than anything, is where Castagna failed. And I hope they try and truly take this feedback to heart.", "author": "David Y."}

The Castagna steak peppercorn sauce is amazing.\n\nBut, I went here because they serve 'daube', a somewhat obscure French beef stew. I was excited to try it but I can only give their daube three stars. It was good, not great.\n\nMy mom's version is physically ugly (a casserole, basically) and Catagna's is much more aesthetically appealing, a stew-based pasta. \n\nMy mom's version uses mashed potatoes as the carb, spread on top of long-cooked beef. Castagna uses really good noodles (five stars for the noodles, prolly made in house) as the vessel for the beef. But my mom's version of daube is way more tasty. It just is.\n\nI'll still go back, but next time I'll reorder the filet mignon and try the lasagna. Also, the cr\u00eapes with house-made jam were very tasty; just didn't have enough jam and the end was burnt. I would say they're a cross between street cr\u00eapes and what I consider more authentically home-style cr\u00eapes. I favor the latter and have never come across them in SF.", "author": "Maya B."}

I had the filet mignon and wanted it with fries but their fryer wasn't working so I got it with roasted potatoes instead.  Which was good.  I also wanted it with the Bernaise sauce but they didn't have that either.  The chef was really nice and came to our table and asked me about other sauces he could make for me.  He ended up making me a delicious mushroom sauce.  The waitress working there was terrible!  She left us waiting for like 15 minutes and forgot about us when the bill came.... we kept looking back at her and she never noticed.\n\nUpdate:  the owner invited me back and everything was great, including the service!!

The servers were fast moving, fast talking, and with a no-BS attitude when it came down to dinner. The menu at first seemed non-inclusive and on the limited side, but once the dishes came descending down onto the table, all doubts were erased. It was all so good.\n\nThe bread to start was simple and perhaps not so impressive to the eyes, but it was served warm and soft with a strong olive oil. They're generous about refilling the bread basket, so by all means, don't be shy to ask for more. The tuna tartare was delicately diced tuna mixed with bits of onion and herbs and dressed with what seemed like a ponzu sauce for a bit of asian flair. The fried chips were delicate and crisp, a perfect contrast to the fish. \n\nDinner continued with the marguerita pizza, a thin crusted pie with not too much tomato sauce or mozzarella, and therefore on the drier side. It was light and refreshing. The beef stew with pasta was a saucy dish that wasn't actually soupy but just moist enough to give life to bouncy ribbon pasta. The chunks of beef were tender and broken-down.\n\nI'm no expert on French cuisine and so can't speak to what region of France the food is from or if it was authentic by any means, but each dish was very lovingly concocted and it clearly showed.", "author": "Cici T."}

The staff were very friendly to younger guest. While this is not the place for loud, playful children to run around (those places are called parks), if your child can sit through dinner quietly enough as not to disturb other guests, this restaurant is quite family friendly, and willing to accommodate the needs and curiosity of our 4 year old son. St\u00e9phane served up a beautifully peeled carrot to satisfy his simple palate, and invited him to the kitchen to show him how sugar is melted to form the hard, top crust of the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.\n\nSome of our favorite foods of the night were the scallops special served with a very savory rice, the French onion soup, and the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nThere are a lot of places for delicious food in SF, but places where the proprietor makes you feel like you are his personal guest is a rare treat.", "author": "Bobby L."}

The owner is also the waiter and is a nice French guy with all the trimmings like talking to you in French and reminding you every time that Nice in France is the best place in the world. The biggest shame is that the best thing about Nice is Socca which he doesn't serve, but that's neither there or here. \n\nThe pizzas are great and highly recommended, they're thin Italian and French style and the best in the area. For the more adventurous there is the daube with pasta which is like a beef stew, although last I had, the beef could have been stewed for longer as it was a tad too chewy and I feel like there could have been more pasta. \n\nDesert was good although the apple part of the tarte tatin should have been more caramelized but I really enjoyed the homemade whipped berry cream that came with it.", "author": "William M."}

He set us up at a table immediately and was our waiter for the evening (we were laughing at how actively he \"wasn't working there\"). It's a lovely, cozy restaurant, though I would describe the food as closer to Italian than traditionally French. The waiter (maybe owner?) went out of his way to be friendly and accommodating.\n\nThe beef carpaccio was very good, with a hint of lemon and good harmony with the greens. My clam pasta was on the salty side and a bit plain--would have liked some veggies on there for the price--but had a strong seafoody flavor. The pasta seemed like an egg noodle and was on the softer side. The clams were quite soft, possibly verging on undercooked, or maybe all the clams I've had have been overcooked? Two people got the beef stew and enjoyed it a lot. One person got a pizza which unexpectedly had prosciutto on it (luckily not a vegetarian), and it was pretty standard. We split a bottle of wine which was ok, but I was expecting something more complex for the price. I would have given it 3 stars for the food alone but the service and atmosphere exceeded expectations.", "author": "Victoria S."}

The chef/owner (?) was present when we dined here, less than 2 weeks ago. He was very attentive, charming, funny, and informative the whole time. We were easily there for 3 hours - took our time with wine, apps, mains. You really get the sense that he is deeply invested in this place and looks after every detail. All the wines on the menu are European (Italian, French, Spanish), and everyone at our table loves wine but not particularly European wine. We told the chef this and he recommended 2 wines that pleased all 5 wine drinkers. My mom eyed some tall beer glasses and asked Stephane half-jokingly how much he wanted for them. He left and returned with paper and two fresh glasses, and wrapped them up for her!\n\nThe food:\nWe ordered...\nFrench onion soup - the first time I liked this dish and omg is it good!\nMussels - also good, but not my favorite dish of the evening.\nSteak\nRavioli\nPesto Pasta\nMargarita Pizza\nPasta Bolognaise\nLamb\nEveryone loved their dishes and the ones I tried (pastas and pizza) were all eye-roll inducing. \n\nOverall: If you are looking for an intimate bistro feel with a lot of \"table-touching\" and personalized attention from the chef, really really yummy \"mmmmmm\"-inducing Italian food and wine, for a date night or a small group dinner, this is the way to go.", "author": "D T."}

Yum! We got this as an appetizer for the table and all really enjoyed it. \n\n*Steak Au Poivre Et Ses Panisses: Filet Mignon-- was tender and the entree was a perfect portion. I got mine medium well and probably should have gotten medium. I would order this again and get it done medium. \n\n* Tarte Tatin a La Sauce Caramel: Caramelized apple tart. This was just OK and could have gone without. Only ordered this because they didn't have beignets for the day (which was my first choice). \n\n*Fondant Au Chocolat: Warm molten chocolate cake-- everyone really enjoyed this for dessert as it was moist and tasty. Would order again. \n\n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here for a date night as it is dim and kind of has a romantic setting. I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because none of the foods really blew my mind or made me feel like I would crave it. However, still giving a very positive review because the staff was great and makes you feel like home (I believe one of the guys was the owner).

We had Rose, french onion soup, mussels (mariniere style) and french fries.  The only reason for four stars instead of five was the french onion soup.  It had way to much cheese and not a lot of flavor.  Beyond that this place was amazing and I will be back.  The mussels were traditional and perfect.  The fries delicious.  The rose was great.  We also had bread to dip in the broth from the brussels and the bread was wonderful.  The service was top notch and the vibe of the restaurant was perfect.  It is pretty small and you feel tucked away in this wonderful little french restaurant amongst the craziness of Chestnut.   \n\nI am a fan!", "author": "Cari N."}

The waiters didn't even hand out bread until 5 minutes before the food actually came out. We were all starving, but thankfully we talked and entertained each other. I can see why people may think this place is great and interesting, but Castagna MUST have a professional checkup on its efficiency and staff. It definitely needs some serious improvement.", "author": "Lorenzo S."}

So I normally always get seafood pasta whenever it's available. But this restaurant had the seafood pasta and also duck leg confit. So I decided to get the duck. My kids love seafood pasta as well so I decided to get it for the kids and have them split it. We started with the French onion soup which was delicious. The Emmentaler was very good and so was the rest of the soup. We shared it with two adults and two kids and it was plenty and filling. They had nice hot and crunchy baguette. My husband ordered the lasagna it came with a side salad and my husband really liked it. The seafood pasta was super delicious. The broth was yummmmmm. My duck leg confit was also very good. We also ordered the garlic fries. They are the thin kind of fries but those were also good. For dessert we got the fondant au chocolat. Which was like a chocolate lava cake with a strawberry cream on the side and some fruit. It was to die for. I didn't want to leave I could have kept eating if I wasn't super full lol. Yummm will be back for sure. We literally finished our meals and I usually never finish my food.", "author": "Rabia K."}

Steak tartare - first time having it, so I can't judge. It was tasty but I think the psychological thought of eating totally raw beef will prevent me from ordering it in the future.\n2. Onion soup - nothing too special to write home about.\n3. Lasagna - I took a bite out of my boyfriend's dish, it didn't seem too special.\n4. Pesto pasta - Pasta was beyond al dente. It was also massively undersalted until I realized the chopped tomatoes on top were very salty. However, it was hard to pick up the tomatoes with a mound of tangled pasta noodles, so I ended up having to alternate bites of bland pasta with salty tomatoes.\n\nWe shared a glass of white wine, which was a generous pour so that was appreciated.\n\nThe service was a bit weird for us. Our table was really small, so we asked to move to a larger table. The waiter said it was reserved for 8pm for 3 people. We had arrived at 6:15pm and while I'm not totally familiar with table reservation etiquette, we were done with our dinner long before the other party arrived and long before 8pm hit, so we were left wondering why we couldn't have the larger table. We sat next to a windowsill, so we placed our table's candles, salt, pepper and bread on the sill just so we could eat. \n\nAdditionally, the people working here seemed to be in a rush to kick us out or something. One waiter in particular kept walking back and forth from the front to the back of the restaurant for no reason. He'd occasionally peer over my boyfriend to see how far along we were in eating. I was really distracted. Another waitress/kitchen staff would come over more often than necessary to check on us. Maybe that's why we left long before 8pm that night.", "author": "Kat Y."}

Yes, there are many good restaurants in San Francisco and we're spoiled with choices but, there's something to be said about quality and atmosphere!  There is such attention to detail and pride as the owner Stephane plates every dish that is served.  Great fresh food, DESSERTS, and lovely wines to choose from.  It is a MUST if you haven't experienced!!!  Owner and entire staff are delightful!!!  Don't miss out!!!!", "author": "Diana K."}

The owner is from Nice and he was brought up with people who loves to cook. He respects food and he enjoys food and it shows through all the menu items. We had the duck confit which was to die for, the fish was awesome, and the lamb burger was out of this world. The owner is wonderful! We love him. Extremely knowledgeable and hospitable. We have nothing but good things to say for our wonderful evening. Lastly, this place is a wonderful value for what you get in the city. We (group of 7) had 4-5 bottles of wine, appetizers, and entrees, all for $100/pp including gratuity. This will be a gem that we will come back to always.", "author": "Stephanie Z."}

It was about 4 PM, and for some strange reason, they were sill serving brunch.\n\nI can't say no to that.\n\nHowever, considering the fact that I knew we were going to eat dinner later, I ended up getting something light. I had myself the ni\u00e7oise salad. It was okay - it wasn't the best. However, my friends had told me that their meals (one including a croque monsier) was delectable.

We arrived a little earlier than our reservation, saw that the restaurant is a pretty cozy place, and were seated at the bar to wait for a table to open up.  I want to say there are 8 tables, which makes for a very intimate setting.  We were seated about 10 minutes after.  We then gave the orders to the waiter about 10 minutes after that.  I ordered the beef stew (Daube a la nicoise et ses pates fraiches) and my boyfriend ordered the lasgna.  The waiter gave us a quick history about the dishes, and how they were recipes from the chef's family.  He also said that the beef stew was very popular, which made me even more excited.  Unfortunately, we waited, and waited, and waited.  An hour passed by and we noticed everyone else in the restaurant were finishing their meals, we finally asked the waiter.  Apparently the order sheet had fallen and the chef never received our order!  We were both hungry and upset, but the chef personally came over to apologize and the waiter brought us glasses of wine and salads to compensate for our time.  The chef delivered the dishes, and it almost killed me how great the beef stew was.  Our hour wait was worth it!!!!! The beef was tender and melts in your mouth and the pappardelle was cooked perfectly.  The lasagna was bubbling when it got to the table, and was also amazing.  Although we didn't have a great experience to start, the waiter and chef at Castagna made sure that we left satisfied.  I can confidently say I will be back again!", "author": "Gina B."}

They make great use of limited space and you don't feel crowded. I especially loved the vintage picture of a french restaraunt that was identical to outside of this restaraunt.\n\n(Food): 3 1/2 - 4 stars, could have been 5 but there was something missing. Overall the food was cooked well and it was very \"clean\" (if you don't know what i mean by clean: not overly greasy, cooked perfect, fresh, etc,) and well presented.\n\nEggs Benedict - came with perfectly cooked golden brown potatoes. The salad was lightly dressed with the perfect balance. The Benedict itself was lacking. It was more of a hint of ham and you couldn't taste it with every bite. The egg was perfectly cooked and the English muffin was very fresh. Where this dish missed the mark was the hollandaise sauce. It was very light and creamy but lacked any flavor or pop.\n\nMimosas - perfect balance of champagne and fresh squeezed OJ.\n\nPom frittes (Frys) - fresh and perfectly cooked. Came with a delicious garlic aioli sauce and ketchup.\n\nCroiqie Madame - it came with the same salad and potatoes I mentioned above. The toast was perfect and so was the egg on top. overall it very good but again was lacking that flavor or pop.\n\nBeneigts - it came with 3 and had Nutella, custard, and apple filling. very disappointed. The dough was too thick and there was not enough filling used for the apple or the custard. They were not beneigts, they tasted more like donut holes and not very good ones.\n\nLatte - it was wonderful and used great coffee!\n\n(Service) the service was good and then it was not.For the most part the food arrived on time and the waitress attended our table filling up water on time.\n\nOur lattes came late because the couple next to us had an order for a burger that was never put in. The (same as ours) waitress came by said, they forgot your burger it will be right out.\" I would've liked to have heard \"sorry, I apologize this happened would you still like to wait and well cook it right away or offer something else.\" The chef/owner was clearly upset this had happened. They brought out the burger and it looked delicious. I didn't see the end result but I hope they took the burger off the bill or made up for it some how.\n\nI asked the waitress if she new where a coffee bean and tea leaf were located. She gave me a weird answer of there are many coffee shops around here, a pause, and then said, we have coffee. I would have preferred her to say I'm not familiar with that place, is there something here we can offer you. In this case there was not something they could offer (I was looking for the location), but it was an awkward interaction. I explained it was a specific chain, so the excuse that maybe she only heard coffee place wouldn't fly on this one.\n\nThe waitress charged the wrong amount on the credit card. Instead of canceling the transaction and charging everything to one bill, she split the bill in half and charged two seperate transactions. She gave us the breakdown on one receipt which made it a little awkward to make sure we weren't over charged. It may be picky of me, I don't know, just another awkward experience.  \n\nI was impressed on how attentive the entire staff would be mindful of the front and be sure to close it when guests would leave it open causing a draft.", "author": "Ava I."}

So of course my experience isn't the same one everyone has, but I am sure from what I experienced that most will have a great experience as well. \n\nStill! This was fan-tas-tic! It's telling that a native of France is so in love with the place he's a biweekly regular. I've spent a lot of time in France myself and it's indeed a very rare Stateside restaurant that lives up to the motherland, but this one does indeed. \n\nIt has a good range of options from which it was very difficult to pick! We started by splitting the tartare which was amazing. The chef comped us a flight of crostini and each one was fantastic, done to perfection and clearly had a lot of love poured into them. I had the Daube A La Nicoise and he had the steak. Both were tremendous! The wine menu was clearly arranged by a very discerning eye and I had a very nice red (can't remember the grape offhand). \n\nOh and the ambiance is lovely. It's a very small room, but that makes it cozy. It's very tastefully appointed and in warmer weather there is limited seating outside. \n\nAll in all, I can see why my friend is a regular.

It's cozy (verging on cramped), but the stellar service and food makes up for it. \n\nTip #1: PARKING IS A NIGHTMARE.  I looped around the same block at least 7 times (not an exaggeration).  Most of it is luck-of-the-draw street parking, but there's also a Wells Fargo parking lot within a block if you're willing to pay.  \n\nTip #2:  The restaurant is small--make a reservation!  The two-person seating and lighting give this place a date night vibe. \n\nTip #3: Excellent service and food.  I'd 100% recommend the steak.  \n\nOverall:  I enjoyed my meal at Castagna. My only complaint comes from the bar seating we were given (even though we made a reservation).  I don't mind where I eat as much as what I eat, but due to the cramped layout of the restaurant, our seating was directly in front of the cashier, kitchen, and serving station.  It detracted from a nice dinner to have waiters rushing back and forth with food and checks.", "author": "Sarah W."}

Live fast, die young, leave love handles big enough to keep the Marina afloat when \"The Earthquake\" hits the Bay Area.\n\nBecause, really, I should be eating a Croque Monsieur every day of my life.

Sitting outside to eat this sandwich on a warm day will make you feel tr\u00e8s Fran\u00e7aise.\n\nUnfortunately the salad they give you on the side (choice of French fries or salad) is oddly salty.  I don't think it's the dressing; I think someone had an iron hand when it came to the salt shaker.\n\nOther options include burgers, savory crepes, salads, fresh pasta and soup of the day, (today's was a fresh pasta with smoked salmon, and the soup was butternut squash), and quiches.\n\nSlightly pricey for an everyday lunch, but also a nice treat when you want a mini-vacation to Paris sans the bikini body.", "author": "Tori S."}

Its intimate size and family-run staff (are the chef and our server twins?) belie the high quality of food the kitchen dishes out.  I had the Florentine Benedict, crowned with tangy Hollandaise and generous twirls of prosciutto.  The poached eggs were a textbook example of what poached eggs should be - barely set whites, and thick, runny yolks that create a lava-like spread when pierced.  Few kitchens get this right.  The accompanying small salad and griddled potatoes reflect the European sensitivities of the place - you don't need a field of potatoes to feel satisfied.\n\nMy wife got the Chicken Sandwich Au Jus, which is so inventive but so obvious I can't believe I've never seen it before.  Imagine slices of perfectly roasted, juicy chicken breast, sweet onions and just-barely-melted cheese (Emmenthaler, maybe?) between slices of crusty, chewy ciabatta - now take that sandwich and dip it in a jus that I suspect is part beef, part chicken...an herby explosion.  Now have a couple of hot, salty matchstick fries.  Repeat until it's all gone.  For dessert, the hot beignets are a can't-miss affair - you can get them plain, but why bother?  Get them stuffed with Nutella, pastry cream and caramelized apples, instead (one of each.)\n\nService is polished, efficient and professional.

Also, although we had reminded the same gentleman that we were waiting for my friends lasagna (because my entree had arrive), he, about 15 minutes late put the lasgna in the oven.

The night of 11/17/2012 my cousin and I were looking for a place to have a nice quiet dinner and a couple of drinks to wash away the traumas of this past week. So here goes the story. Me and my cousin enter Castagna and get seated by this wonderful young blonde lady. Next thing you know this blonde lady comes by and says that this area we were seated at was already reserved and she is sorry about the whole confusion and is it okay that we get seated somewhere else. My cousin and I being all modest and humble and quite the respectful sensitive people, didn't take offense to it and said \"alright we can move it's whatever.\" So we moved and got seated somewhere else. Then after we got comfortable and seated the blonde lady comes back and says that \" I am sorry ladies but the whole restaurant is booked and that includes the booth. I am sorry about that.\" At this point I had just had it with this people. It is something else to be seated once and get moved/kicked out but TWICE!???? What the fuck!? I try to be rationale and not take things personal but that was FUCKN personal! The owner came to us while we were getting ready to leave saying that the blonde lady was \" new and in training\" claiming that she doesn't know what she is doing but here my question for the owner is \" Why did you tell her (blonde lady) that the FIRST place we were seated at was reserved and after all that, when we got seated somewhere else and got settled you sent her again to do your work and tell us that the whole restaurant was booked? Sorry Mr. French Guy but we were only there for one drink and dinner. A maximum of 45 minutes would do especially the fact that your whole restaurant was empty with only 6 customers. I hope that me and my cousin being black had nothing to do with this ridiculous incident and I hope that your conscious doesn't bother you for treating us like that. If you must know, we are good tippers and we intended to give a lot especially after this horrible week I had, I just wanted a peaceful dinner. I will never come to your restaurant or ever recommend it to anyone. You are one racist piece of crap. I may have been dressed down but I am a registered nurse with a license to save lives and I could have possibly done wonders if anything happened at your restaurant.

There were empty seats available, however, including a few tables outside. By the end of the meal I was amazed that the place wasn't packed at weekend brunch time, and noted that other Chestnut St. restaurants had good crowds. I think some of the mediocre reviews here have put off people, and that's too bad, because the food and service are really good and prices are moderate for the area.  It is also close to the corner of Fillmore, where there are many parking spaces between Chestnut and Marina Blvd. Most were full, but it's an area where things open up if you're patient. We found a curb spot long enough for a large SUV!\n\nMy husband is on a quest for great Eggs Benedict, and he said that Castagna's was the best he'd had in a long while. The eggs were perfectly cooked, the muffins right, the Canadian bacon classic, and the Hollandaise excellent. (I tasted it, and thought it needed more lemon, but my husband, the expert, said the lemom was subtle and just right.) I had a Salade Nicoise that I thoroughly enjoyed. I am in quest of the perfect Salade Nicoise, (Right now I have to say that The Left Bank in Larkspur has it.) But this one was a little different, and very good. The center  had Arugula heaped up, surounded by the usual Nicoise additions including perfectly cooked green beans, olives, perfect hard-boiled egg, anchovies (the latter two better than Left Bank's), and sliced rounds of rare Ahi. Light vinagrette. Very nice.  It comes in two sizes, and I had the large. I think that the smaller version with their French onion soup would make a delightful lunch.\n\nHot French bread was really good, and replenishments are offered.\n\nThe regular house coffee is delicious. Rich and chocolatey. My husband had it, and I kept sneaking sips, though I had my own very good latte. I should have asked what coffee they use, because the flavor was excellent. \n\nWe shared a Creme Brule' that had one of those hard crunchy tops that you have to break through to get to the warm custard inside. This was a good one, and the egg custard had a rich taste.\n\nI saw some good-looking dishes being served around us, including a heaping bowl of mussels that I'd like to try, and some tall hamburgers with cones of some type of fries.

You do not need to hurry to finish your plate such as in some other restaurants. I hate when the waiter comes your table and try to clean your plate while others are still eating. It feels like they rush you to finish your food. Most French restaurant in US seems to adopt a more European service style where the guest can enjoy their meal and spend time enjoying the food.", "author": "L. G."}

And even if doesn't look like it, it is really kids friendly place.\nTo finish, the check wasn't not that expensive.

BTW, walk was short and the neighborhood very enjoyable.\n\nWe seated at the sidewalk tables on a beautiful SF evening. The food is all well presented with artistic touches to the compositions.\n\nWe shared a plate with five different styles of crostini; the tapenade and goat cheese along with the Nicoise style really stood out, but they were all incredible.  The chickpea fries 'les panisses' were mouthwatering with a nice crunch to the outside, but a soft and tender inside and not greasy in the slightest.\n\nWe also split the Salad Nicoise and the Bolognaise pasta, both of which provided plenty of food and were scrumptious.  Again, with the presentation and excellent balance of flavors, the evening seemed to go on and on.  I'd also highly recommend the bignets for desert; while the apple variety were still good, in retrospect, I'd concentrate on the Nutella and Cr\u00e8me Anglaise.\n\nI also can't say enough about the owner and staff.  They were always friendly, attentive and mindful of the details.  The recommendation of a French white to accompany our dinner hit the perfect balance of acidity and tart fruit to compliment the salad and crostini.\n\nI had a question mark about the apparent mixed French/Italian menu, due to my own ignorance, but quickly got over it... the owner is from Nice in southern France's Provencal region, a stone's throw away from the Italian border, and when the food and service are this good, why would I care?", "author": "Jason P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-30", "description": "Castagna is a tribute to high-quality neighborhood dining.  The menu is delightfully conceived and executed, and features mainly \"classic\" French bistro and casual Italian dishes (they are not aiming for cutting edge, fusion, or a New American take on French dining).  We had the pasta of the day (fresh made pasta cooked in a lightly creamy and buttery sauce with saut\u00e9ed carrots and onions), a nicely tender steak au poivre with a savory green peppercorn sauce and served with light and highly addictive fries, and brussels sprouts with bacon.  The meal was delicious; the service responsive, amiable, and kid-friendly; and the space inviting and casual, yet classy, which makes it suitable for anything from a casual meal to a more dressed up family dinner or date.  Reminiscent of some of my favorite neighborhood spots in Manhattan, Castagna manages to use every inch of its modest kitchen efficiently and effectively.   \n\nCastagna is a great option in the Marina/Cow Hollow area.  Reservations on Open Table are highly advised, since this spot fills up quickly.", "author": "Chris T."}

I had a linguine with chicken in a tomato based sauce, with a most excellent side salad.  The pasta itself was delicious, but the sauce was too runny and the chicken did not taste of much.

Today was our second time at Castagna and we were just as pleased as before.  I actually liked my food even more this time.  The food is simple fare but done really, really well.  Last time I got the pulled pork sandwich but today I opted for the rotisserie chicken sandwich w/ gruyere and oh.my.God. Yep, that's all I'm going to say about that.  Hubby liked the one bite he took off of my pulled pork sandwich last time so much that he decided to get it for himself today and scarfed it down quickly, licking his jowls like a happy pup. I couldn't finish my sandwich but, just like last time, it will be my delicious dinner.  While we waited for our \"to die for\" beignets to take home, we watched one of the owners making a few dishes for another table, delicately taking his time to craft the presentation ... my husband and I turned to each other and said at the same time, \"that's love right there.\" Yep, they put love into their food; one ingredient you just can't find at most places.

The waiter was a snob, for what reason, I just don't know. Went on a Thursday 10 minutes earlier than my reservation time and just wanted to get my elderly mother out of the wind while we were waiting for our third party.  i guess the waiter didn't hear me that we had reservations but allowed us to sit a few minutes before asking us to move to a smaller table. However, allowed someone else off the street to use the bathroom with no question at all. Very small restaurant with expensive dishes, no bar but expensive wines with paper napkins. gormet hamburger too hard to eat. Spicy mussles, were hardly spicey. Too many better places nearby.", "author": "christina d."}

The burger had roasted tomatoes (I usually don't like tomatoes but I loved these), onions that had been saut\u00e9ed in rosemary, time and garlic, ketchup, mustard and brie cheese. This was the best burger I have ever had. The atmosphere was fantastic. It pretty quiet but not so quiet that it is awkward if you say something at a normal loudness. I sat at the bar and the head chef was showing us what he was making and doing; it was very amusing. For desert I had beignets. They were the best desert I have ever had. I recommend Castangna for a nice dinner with your family or friends. If you want to be loud I wouldn't go here because it is a pretty small restaurant. This would be a perfect  place for a date.", "author": "John D."}

Yes, Chestnut Street.  I have eaten there 4 times; so it passes the consistency test.  Try the specials.  The tomato and mushroom soups are to die for.  The daily pasta has been cooked perfectly (wish I could say that about more Italian restaurants in town).  The pizzas are superb.  The confit de canard was the best outside France, heck, better than I remember there, too.  They even have beer on tap.  Love Castagna.  Great service too!", "author": "James K."}

Everything I have tried on their menu so far has been amazing (eggs benedict, mussels, mushroom soup, beignets) and the fresh Acme bread and butter that comes with every meal is delicious! Also the waitress it super sweet and personable. Love coming here :)", "author": "Maya C."}

Brothers Stephan(chef) and Jerome(happy diner manager) are more fun than ever and creating magic in the Marina. For those of you that dont know, the brothers owned the very highly regarded Cassis, named after the small fishing village near nice the two came from. They decided to lose the overhead of a 200 seat restaurant, and now have a stunning 40 seat southern french bistro which includes an eight seat eating bar right in front of the cooking action(our favorite place to sit, and a great place to dine alone and not feel alone for a second, we made five new friends last night. On to the food, our appetizer last night was a fantastic tuna tartar I cant tell you what was in it, but it was unique and ill be ordering it again next time. Main courses were the dinner size portion of mussels provencale with pomme frites and a stunning piece of sea bass perfectly and lightly coated in fennel and seasonings. These guys REALLY know fish, having grown up with a father who was a commercial fisherman. Dessert was a molten chocolate cake that was light and perfect balance with 70% dark chocolate and also an apple tart that was one of the top ten desserts Ive ever had. The brothers really know their wines and we enjoyed a lovely french rose with our meal. Top top entree price was I think about $26 and the mussels dinner portion about $16...very reasonable by marina/pac heights standard....I'm going back tonight and will probably eat there weekly....", "author": "Dr. Olga S."}

We spotted an empty table from the door and decided to give it a try. After all, it was one of the only few places without a long wait. I had a serving of their fresh pasta with pesto. There's just something about fresh pasta that screams \"home cooked meal.\" It was a delightful dish with the pesto made just the way I like it: fragrant and creamy. The husband ordered fresh pasta with arrabiata sauce and chicken apple sausage. He said it was really good. While are dishes were very much enjoyed, the desserts were definitely the highlight. Since we couldn't decide, we opted for both the creme brulee and the beignets. The beignets are served on a platter; one of each flavor (pastry cream, hazelnut, and apple). I definitely loved the pastry cream! The creme brulee was pretty much the pastry cream itself with the caramelized sugar and berries on the side. It was definitely the best creme brulee I've had since I went to France. It was hard not to reminisce. We were introduced to the owner/chef who happily entertained patrons throughout his tiny yet charming restaurant. He was French-go figure. No wonder the food was amazing! We will be back, Castagna! We had a great time!", "author": "Allison M."}

It's a small pocket cafe, that probably cannot hold more than 30 people but the food is incomparable. The french onion soup I had rivaled some soups I had in France. The food is so good.

A cozy, little restaurant that is getting lots of regulars. Great classic French/Nicoise bistro dinner menu. The two brothers  who own it, run it, plan menu and cook are fun and fantastic. Have brought our Parisian relatives here, told many friends about it and they all love it too.  Can't go a couple weeks without stopping in.

The staff is friendly and attentive. The chef/owner and his brother both made it a point to introduce themselves and everyone couldn't have been more welcoming to our small son. My tuna tartare appetizer was excellent and I will probably develop regular cravings for it. We liked everything we ordered. Prices were reasonable. The food though was a little slow coming out. Overall, everything you could hope for in a small, French neighborhood restaurant just blocks from our home.", "author": "Gila M."}

As he suggested the specials for the day and handed me the menu, my eyes fell on the words Dr. Pepper.   As one of Dr. Pepper's (DP) biggest fans, I had to get the cherry DP BBQ pork pulled sandwich after the chef explained how it's made. It was delicious and very satisfying. It was by far the least messiest BBQ sandwich I've ever hand. Will be back for more, Castagna.", "author": "Ruth R."}

I almost hope it doesn't become as popular as some of the other small restaurants in the Marina, as I really love walking right in and having a seat. I've had breakfast here twice, and picked up dinner once. Everything was good! Minus one star due to the fact they don't  open 'til 9 on the weekends and close at 5. Could also use a slightly bigger breakfast/brunch menu....trying to stay away from those carbs!", "author": "Tory K."}

We also had the linquini with clam sauce-delish but a little creamy for me, I prefer more of a zesty light clam sauce.  Dining room is very small.  Overall a nice meal.  Only negatives were the coffee, it was sour tasting like the old robusta beans not Arabica. I expect better.  Also, the beignets  was a disappointment,  a donut shop around the corner would have been better, the beignet was just a tiny puff with a squirt of cream...very underwhelming.  It wasn't even warm.", "author": "g s."}

The owner greets you at the door and then ensures your dining experience is great. The moules (garlic, parsley) with fries was incredible. The pizzas are also delicious and perfectly cooked. If you want to experience Paris on Chestnut street, this is the place to visit. It's a small restaurant, which I personally like. Has a great neighborhood feel. The wine list isn't too big and the choices are very good and reasonably priced.

Maybe it was pure coincidence but it left a bitter after taste in my mouth for its racism suggestion -- even though admittedly we had their very delicious beignets.  We walked in without reservations and noticed that there was only one table for two available. The host/waiter told us, after having checked the computer, that that very table was reserved.  We told him that we could sit outside (he didn't offer), even though it was freezing cold as long as the heat was turned on. So we sat outside. Even though the heat was on, it was not strong enough and it was still cold. We finished and got up only to notice that no person had walked in since we had sat down, that very table that was supposed to have been reserved had no one occupying it, and there were two additional tables available. The host never gave us the option for either. Then I noticed that my girlfriend and I were the only dark/ethnic patrons of that restaurant. Again, maybe it was a mere coincidence, but it was still something that I couldn't avoid noticing. Especially since I've been going to many restaurants in the Bay area and never encountered such treatment or felt discriminated. I doubt I'll go back and will definitely repeat this story to every one I know.", "author": "Yanni G."}
