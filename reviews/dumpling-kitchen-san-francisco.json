Pan fried pork buns \n\nFood impressions\n1. Rich and savory soy milk with bits of pickle and pork sung at the bottom. The donut was also nice and crispy.\n2. Fresh and generous portion with whole saut\u00e9ed garlic cloves. Not too salty with a good crunch. \n3. Thick skin (too thick for my preference), but good pork/leek flavor, and very garlicky vinegar sauce, which I liked. \n4. Again, thick skin, but pork flavor was super savory. \n5. Five-spice forward and crisp skin. \n6. My favorite dish! Small delicate crispy and chewy with a juicy pork flavor. There was a hint of sweetness in the dough, too.

Came here on Sunday around 12PM and was already super packed, I joined the waitlist though so thankfully skipped the wait. Ordered the XLB, spicy wontons, beef stew, and green onion pancake. \n\n-XLBs were sooooo good!! The skin was thicker than others I've had but I think this helped hold the broth inside of the dumplings better, very flavorful. Ask for the red vinegar w/ ginger with this, so delicious! \n-Spicy wontons IMO could be better, the chili oil wasn't that flavorful and not that spicy. But I loved the wonton skins and the filling inside.\n-Beef in the beef stew was SO tender and the noodles were perfect!! Only complaint was that the broth itself though was very bland, but I'd order again for the meat because it was cooked perfectly which I find a lot of restaurants always tend to over cook.\n-The green onion pancake was a last minute decision, my boyfriend and I saw it on another party's table and decided we needed that in our life. Best decision ever, the green onion pancake was sooo flaky on the inside and soft on the inside. Definitely a must try!\n\nEverything was reasonably priced and portions were just right. The food we got were definitely I feel meant for a party of 4, don't know how we managed to eat everything between us two lol! Total came to be 42 with tip.

And Xiao Long Bao (soup dumplings) are my favorite kind. \n\nThis place has been in my bookmarks for a while and since I was in the area, I decided to give them a shot. \n\n*CASH OR DEBIT CARD ONLY*\n\nService is kind, fast, efficient. Since I came during a late afternoon (on a weekday) business was slow and I was quickly seated. \n\nI only had their xiao long baos (~$9 for 10 pieces). \n\nThis is probably one of the most judged about dishes in Chinese culture (from personal experience and from article/videos by food journalists). \n\nTraditionally, a xlb should have no less than 18 folds which was not the case throughout my experience. I don't mind the lack of folds, but I was disappointed to see that some skin/wrapping was inflated(swelled)/doughier. The same dumplings had less soup inside. Each dumpling lacked consistency with the next. The soup was okay and the meat was fine - nothing out of the ordinary and tastes like a normal dumpling. \n\nI don't really see the value since that's nearly a dollar per dumpling and the execution is inferior to the ones I order frozen from a company in LA. \n\nIt's a decent option if you're in the area and want something super causal to each for lunch but otherwise I would look for other options.", "author": "Ida H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-07", "description": "*500th review!*\n\nI wanted to save a special place for this milestone review, and Dumpling Kitchen is definitely very special to me. I live in a city thriving with plenty of great restaurants, but unfortunately we don't have any places to get soup dumplings (xiao long bao), or XLB for short. XLB are filled with pork and a gelatinous sheet that turns into liquid when steamed. I've wanted to try them ever since learning about them on some travel food show, so I researched for all the places to get them in SF. Finding and eating XLB and going to Alcatraz were the only two things I knew I HAD to do on my trip! \n\nMy boyfriend and I took a long Uber ride to Taraval to check out two different places for XLB. Dumpling Kitchen was up first. The dining room is decently sized and was full of people enjoying bamboo baskets full of steaming dumplings. We were seated right away at one of the last open tables. Of course we wanted to order the XLB but we also got chicken with black bean sauce as we were pretty hungry. After a short wait, the soup dumplings came out and I could tell they were going to be delicious! The wrappers were so thin and delicate, yet held up to the poking of my chopsticks. I had done research on the \"right\" way to eat XLB but it took a lot of willpower for me to not just shovel them into my mouth. You have to be careful as they're pretty hot! I bit a small hole into one to let the steam escape, slid it onto my spoon with a little sauce, and slurped it all up. Immediately the flavorful soup burst into my mouth and I could taste the salty pork - it was seriously one of the best food experiences I've had. The waiting and the buildup was totally worth it and I was not let down! I wanted to order more but had to stop myself. The texture of the dumpling and the warmth of the soup was so comforting and I couldn't stop smiling. I told my boyfriend - don't like this too much, we can't get these at home!\n\nThe chicken with black bean sauce was also excellent - wonderful flavor without being overly salty, and perfectly cooked. Service was prompt and pretty much silent but I didn't care, I could barely focus on anything beyond the XLB in front of me. SO GOOD. I wish I could eat them every day.\n\n500 stars, Dumpling Kitchen. I love you and your xiao long bao.", "author": "Katy C."}

However, with that being said, I think there are less options for dumplings in SF so it gets a passing grade. As you can tell from the Yelp page, this place is in general really popular and busy, though the wait isn't unreasonably long - I think we waited maybe 15 minutes to be seated. I came here on Saturday evening around 7:30pm and ordered the Tofu + Spinach soup, potstickers, and pan-fried pork buns. \n\nFirst, the pan-fried pork buns are smalllllll. They look really pretty and cute and aesthetic, but the flavor is kinda whatever. The bun itself was a bit soggy/soft, and was lacking the really thick breaded texture I like in pan-fried pork buns. I think I would have definitely liked these a lot more if they had been normal size, because these are just too small to be satisfying. They're kinda like... crispy-bottom XLB which is like wtf lmao.\n\nThe potstickers were better than the pan-fried pork buns IMO but again, I was underwhelmed. Just like pan-fried pork buns, the potstickers are kinda small, and though they are REALLY CUTE AND AESTHETICALLY PLEASING, the taste definitely fell a bit short for me. \n\nOn the plus side, the filling is put together very nicely inside and doesn't fall apart when biting into the dumpling(s). Also, the dumplings all come out piping hot, so you can tell that they're really made fresh.\n\nAnyway, I probably wouldn't come back here.

It was absolutely exquisite!\n\nThe soup dumplings were okay, they were not as juicy as I would've hoped and they were too delicate, so they would puncture when lifting them off the paper they were stuck to, causing the soup to leak out prior to making it to my pallet.\n\nThe fried vegetarian spring rolls were the best spring rolls I've ever had.

They weren't as soupy as I thought they would be, but there was still a tad bit of soup.\n\n- pan-fried pot stickers: My favorite out of the 3 dumplings. The skin was good and it was fried perfectly. It had a nice flavor but also was not dry on the inside.\n\n- shanghai style pan-fried pork buns: This was pretty good. Very similar to the pot stickers, except the skin seemed thicker.\n\n- mu shu pork: It came with 6 shells for you to load up the mu shu pork with. This was extremely good and satisfying.\n\n- pork belly with preserved vegetables: The pork belly was soft, the amount of vegetables was just right, and it was delicious. Put it on top of rice, and you have yourself a great meal. This would probably be my fave dish out of everything.\n\n- chow mein: I can't remember which kind, but it was full of ingredients. Meat, veggie, noodles... everything was balanced.\n\nOverall, everything was tasty. It definitely fixed my Chinese food craving. Next time, I'd say skip the shanghai dumplings though.", "author": "Julian Y."}

We wanted to try something different so I yelped \"dumplings\" and found this place. Yelp gave us the option to sign up on their live waiting list and we did! It also gave us a timeframe of the wait and I immediately received a text confirmation. Great! No need to worry about waiting too long.\n\nWith traffic, we made it there in 25 mins just in time to check in with the host. Luck happened to be on our side as we drove 1 round and found a parking spot in front of the restaurant. I checked in with the host and waited about 15 more minutes before we were seated. \n\nWe ordered 5 plates for 2 adults and 2 kids. Yes! It didn't seem like we ordered enough. Lol  We love to eat. We finished 2.5 plates and took the rest to go. The Shanghai steamed dumplings and fried pork dumplings were delish! The fried chicken was covered in a spicy sweet & tangy sauce but it wasn't spicy at all. The braised pork belly & preserved veggies were very flavorful. Lastly, the beef & brocolli over rice was yummy. This plate was for my boys and they almost finished it for a 3 & 5 yo boys. The beef was very tender that we were able to cut it in small pieces using the silverware. \n\nThe service was quick and great given that it was run by young adults. Surpringly, they run it better than other restaurants I've been to. Everything was smooth & fast with cleaning up tables, seating customers, taking orders and food coming out.

The soup dumplings were perfect! The soup was flavorful, the wonton wrap was soft but thick, sturdy enough to not break. The meat was tender and juicy! The wontons were similar in taste, but paired very well with the chili oil. The chicken wings had a crisp on the skin and was moist. No complaints with this place!

I recommend the salt and pepper fish (battered and fried, served with fresh jalape\u00f1os); the eggplant garlic - the eggplant is suuuper fresh and cooked just right (a lot of places do it undercook eggplant), and the seafood and tofu soup which doesn't need any additional sauces at all, though a little spicy chutney never hurts ;)\nOther items we ordered that everyone loved were sweet and sour fish, Kung Lao shrimp, sweet and sour shrimp (seriously SO good), and the Chinese donuts which is basically fried dough that tastes amazing dipped in the soup.\n\nThe service is really quick, the place is clean, and the food is perfection.

Came for a later lunch on a Saturday (1pm-ish).\n\nVenue / Service: tiny unassuming restaurant on the outside, almost like a hole in the wall.  No reservations, so you have to time it correctly so you don't have to wait long; we waited around 30 min for a table to open up.  Surprisingly fits a decent amount of people inside.  Service was pretty quick, given how busy the place was.  Probably helps that they don't do it the cart-style- instead you note on a menu what you want and how many orders and they fire that order.  \n\nFood: between 2 people, we ordered the right amount.  Highlights were the dumplings of course and went on my date's recommendation.\n-- Sizzling Rice Soup with Chicken ($10.50) - never tried this before, but was surprised how light the dish was.  Perhaps it's b/c most soups are on the oily or thick side, but this one was somewhat refreshing.  Liked how there were chunks of chicken, mushroom, and then the crispy rice that pops when it hits the soup (think snap crackle pop).  \n\n-- Pea Shoots w/ Garlic ($12.75) - I usually order this whenever I do dim sum to have a veggie, and this one didn't disappoint.  Not too oily and a lot of garlic (beware those who don't like garlic).\n\n-- Crab + pork steamed dumplings ($11.50 for 8 pieces) - we went with this one since my date recommended this type vs. the usual pork ones.  Definitely a different flavor profile and slightly lighter on the palette with the crab.  Wrapper wasn't too thick either (yay) so you really could taste the filling and soup inside.\n\n-- Beijing style Sweet Buns (deep-fried)($3.75 for 4 pieces) - never tried this before but a good dessert option if you need a sweet fix.  The bun was slightly on the oily side but tasted good when you dipped it into the condensed milk sauce.  The sauce on its own was a bit sweet but together it all works.\n\nAll together came out to less than $20 per person, which I think is a good deal.  So if you are looking for a dim sum spot and specifically want good dumplings (especially the xiaolongbao), this is a spot to try!", "author": "Audrey H."}

Dimpling Kitchen has everything from XLB, Pan fried buns, potstickers, chicken, veggies, and many other Shanghai dishes. Once you arrive, you have to sign your name on the waiting list by the door. The list may be long but the wait wasn't that bad - around 20 minutes for us (7th on the list) to get a table on Sunday 1:30pm. \n\n#1 XLB - Shanghai style steamed pork dumplings(10). These are the best! It came in a pretty clean bamboo steamer, served pipping hot. The skin wasn't thick like most restaurants, but obviously isn't as paper thin as Ding Tai Fung's but I'm not complaining considering this is the bay area. The pork filling was bomb - Perfect meat to fat ratio, and extremely juicy! Just the way it should be. \n\n#5 Shanghai style pan fried pork buns(10) - I've been trying so hard to find a place that makes decent pan fried buns, and I think I've found it! Their buns are small but a great size. CRISPY bottom, juicy pork filling, and puffy dough.\n\n#22 Crispy egg puffs(3) - Perfect dessert! Order ahead because it takes 20m to make, so it will be served around the time you finish your meal. The egg puffs are super fresh and delicious - puffy, eggy, and sugary. \n\n#75 dry braised string beans - classic order, and delicious. Very generous portion. I liked how the string beans were not overly fried and oily, and had a nice taste blended with Chinese pickled radish and soy sauce. \n\n#119 Dry Fried chicken wings(9) - good! Every restaurant has their own style (eg. San Tung) but theirs is not bad either. I feel like Dumpling Kitchen's is less sweet and has a vinegar / tangy taste to it that I enjoyed. The wings are crispy and soaked with a thick syrup sauce.\n\nThe location is a little inconvenient and far from downtown SF, but if I'm around I'll definitely come back!\n\nFavorites:\n* #1 XLB - Shanghai style steamed pork dumplings ($8.95)\n* #5 Shanghai style pan fried pork buns ($8.95)\n* #22 Crispy egg puffs ($5.75)\n* #75 dry braised string beans ($9.50)\n* #119 Dry Fried chicken wings ($10.50)", "author": "Victoria L."}

The restaurant serves your typical Chinese dishes ranging from different meat options, noodles, and rice plates. The menu reminds me of San Tung's but nowhere near as good. I was really disappointed because nothing was impressive nor memorable; it's decent at best.\n\nWe ordered:\n1. Shanghai-style Steamed Pork Dumplings (10 pcs) - $8.95\n- This was mediocre. The dumpling was dry and cold.\n2. Crab and pork Steamed Dumplings (8pcs) - $11.95\n- I enjoyed the flavor and texture of this dish, but I don't know if it's worth it for this price.\n3. Shanghai-styled Chow Mein\n- Oily and super salty!\n4. Dry-fried Chicken Wings\n- Disappointing. Keep in mind that this isn't San Tung; the chicken wings are not fried and the sauce is somehow tasteless.\n5. Chicken and Corn Soup (basically like egg drop soup)\n- I surprisingly enjoyed this soup even though it lacked in ingredients.\n\nWhen my party of 4 came on a weekday, the restaurant was fairly full. We were seated immediately and the wait time for the food was slightly longer than expected. No complaints here. The biggest disappointment was definitely the food; I expected better and it didn't deliver. It's not worth it for the price and I don't think I would ever come back again. \n\nInstead of Dumpling Kitchen, I recommend San Tung (for your chicken wing cravings) and Shanghai Dumpling King (for the Xiao Long Baos/steamed dumplings).", "author": "Michelle L."}

My boyfriend is NOT the type to drive long distance just for food, especially to San Francisco, so I had to butter him up and up-sell the food. I kept on insisting that what we had was amazing (he is also a lover of xiao long bao), so he finally gave into making the trip. Oh, and it was our 5 year anniversary, so he let me have my foodie day trip in SF. hahaha\n\nDumpling Kitchen is located right off of Taraval Street, so you have to find street parking. Pretty difficult..we kept driving around in circles and finally found a 1hr. parking area. We arrived to the restaurant around 2:30pm, so luckily we missed the breakfast/lunch rush for a Saturday. YES-we were starving by that point. Such a long trek from SJ to SF because we have to drive locally after exiting the freeway for quite a bit, just to get to the restaurant. \n\nThe restaurant was nearly full but we got seated right away. I had everything I wanted to order memorized by the time we got out of our car, so I was ready to order once we sat! The waiters/waitresses were more focused on bringing the food out and cleaning the tables, so it look awhile to wave one of them down.. They seemed confused if we asked for anything extra, even for water/ice water and we had to always repeat ourselves at least 2x.\n\nWe ordered..\n\nGREEN ONION PANCAKE $5.95 -not even crispy! :( This is usually the highlight of our dumpling meals but Dumpling Kitchen's version was just soft and flat. No green onion flavor-no crunch, it just tasted like bread dough. \n\nSTICKY RICE ROLL $4.75 -aka \"fan tuan\" meh. The sticky rice surrounding the thin chinese donut was very dry/chewy?..not soft and sticky at all. Actually the whole roll was just dry..from the powdery pork sung to the chinese donut to the 'sticky rice'. It would literally fall apart once we removed the plastic wrap that held everything together. \n\nSAVORY SOY MILK $3.75 -didn't really taste like soy milk..pretty bland. There were a few pieces of shredded meat and pickled veggies at the bottom of the bowl, and they topped it with chinese donut. \n\nWONTONS IN CHILI OIL (10pieces) $8.95 -the wontons were HUGE! My boyfriend really liked this but I thought it was OK. I ate half a wonton and let him devour the rest. The wontons were made of pork and some sort of veggie. The \"chili oil\" they were sitting in was creamy and had a peanut sauce flavor to it. \n\nPAN FRIED PORK BUNS (10pieces) $8.95 -aka \"sheng jian bao.\" The best item of our meal! Loved how the pan fried pork buns actually had CRISPY BOTTOMS and the dough wasn't too thick! It wasn't heavy and you wouldn't get full/tired from eating just one pork bun. YUM.\n\nSTEAMED PORK SOUP DUMPLINGS (10pieces) $8.95 -aka \"xiao long bao/xlb's/shanghai soup dumplings\" The girl who brought this out threw a giant silver spoon into the steamer basket and popped one of our xlb's!! :( Uhm, hello..you're ruining that best part of this dumpling! The soup dumplings were pretty soupy but we didn't think the meat filling itself was that great.\n\nEverything we ordered came with a giant silver spoon..which I thought was kind of funny. Their black vinegar and chili oil available table side were great! I think there was something in the oil that made our mouths numb because we both agreed that after a few bites, we weren't really able to taste anything. Not because it was spicy, but something in the oil just numbed our tongues. ha!\n\nDon't think we'll come back anytime soon, only because its such a far drive for us. I can see it as a local favorite and we would probably stop by more often if we lived closer..but only for the pork soup dumplings and pan fried pork buns.", "author": "Truc T."}

We perused the menu and finally decided on four dishes: Xiao Long Bao, Shanghai Style Chow Mein, Pea Sprouts with Garlic, and Beef and Mushroom.\n\nWe're starving and the food comes out in a timely manner which is awesome. First the Xiao Long Bao. Tasty, but not as good as Shanghai House. Nevertheless, its tasty and we are chowing down. Next comes the Shanghai Style Chow Mein. This one is pretty tasty as well and we are digging in. Great start to the meal so far.\n\nThis is when things went south... \n\nNext up was the Pea Sprouts. Being part of the InstaMafia, the camera always eats first. I snap a pic and then the SO turns the plate around and shows me the tiny half inch worm in the dish. I'm not offended or miffed as these things happen and I'm pretty easy going. We tell the waiter and he takes it back without hesitation. He comes back out in a few minutes and asks if we want another pea sprout dish as a replacement. I declined because I'm weary of restaurants and sending back dishes. Who knows if they would just pick the worm out and re-serve it to to us as \"new\". To avoid that whole mess, we just decline. \n\nWe go back to chowing down our first two dishes when our last dish comes out. Beef and Mushrooms with some veggies. Looks great! Before I can whip out the iPhone, the SO points at the dish and there's a 5 inch black hair right at the edge where the sauce meets the plate. You can't miss it. We wave down the waiter (Johnny) and tell him there's a hair in the food. \n\nJohnny: Is this your hair?\n(Note: My head is shaved and the SO has super long hair)\nMe: Ummm what?\nJohnny: It wasn't there when I brought it out.\nME: (Caps not for dramatic purposes, I was really yelling) WHY WOULD WE PUT HAIR IN OUR FOOD?!? \n\nSo the waiter takes the food back with a scoff and that was the moment I decided NEVER to come here again.\n\nThe check came and we were never happier to just pay and get out of this place to find some better food since we were still hungry.\n\nLooking back, not sure why the waiter got angry.

Came here on a weekend dinner time and had a short 5-10 minute wait time. \nThis place (unlike many dumpling places in Daly City) has pretty substantial seating that fits small and big groups.\n\nThey have many different dumpling selections and other original Chinese dishes (seafood, chicken, beef, etc). DEFINITELY recommend getting their xiao long bao (soup dumplings) that comes with 10 pieces in a bamboo tray, fresssshly steamed! The meat inside is tender, juicy pork and they definitely master the perfect amount of soup/dumpling ratio! I love dipping it with vinegar and soy sauce! \nI also tried their beef and string beans entree and it was decent (not delicious but not bad). I think the sauce they cook it with was definitely lacking some flavor. \nLastly, I tried the Wontons in chili oil.. bleh.. the wonton meat was good but tiny compared to the wonton amount. The \"chili oil sauce\" was bland, tasted like nothing whereas its supposed to be spicy and at least somewhat flavorful. I'm usually very sensitive with spicy food and i couldn't taste a thing. The bill ended up being about $30 for 2 people with a small amount of leftovers. \nAlso, RICE DOESNT COME FREE; you have to pay extra for it ):\n\nService is decent and pretty fast but I definitely wouldn't come here for anything but the xiao long bao.

Wontons in chili sauce, xiaolong baos, green onion pancakes, and fried rice. After a six-hour drive from LA to SF, stomachs were making everyone pretty hangry. And as the birthday girl the first meal I craved for was dumplings! \n\nNow for the real reason why some stars were knocked down: time constraint. We were being told they were having a hard time figuring out where to seat us because there were too many bigger reservations coming in that night (who weren't even there yet!) BUT if we manage to finish eating by 7:30pm then they can seat us.. It was bad courtesy in my opinion. The kind that would draw away customers but luckily for them we were too eager to eat and not willing to wait for another line at another joint that we took on their challenge to eat by their allotted time. They sat us by 7:00pm! They rushed us in every possible way but we ate and took however much time we needed regardless of their disclaimer. \n\nALSO, they need to be more weary of allergies.. Because their wonton spicy chili sauce has peanut in it. So do be aware because my best friend got a reaction from it but thankfully had Benadryl. They were so focused on rushing us that they didn't allow any communication in between before ordering and that definitely brought down the experience even more.\n\nSo the moral of this experience is that Dumpling Kitchen shouldn't be intimidated by larger groups or forget good customer service. You get better business from them! So don't rush your customers who are there to appreciate your food and business. \n\nBecause of the service they offered us that night, I doubt we'll be coming back. Thankfully it's SF. There will always be the bad and the good. \n\nPro-tip: All I'll give these guys is that because they aren't in Chinatown, it is a dumpling house that is slightly better priced.

I know, it's totally unfair to compare, so I'll try my best to forget my benchmarks. \nLet's start with the soup dumplings. I don't think they use jellified stock (pidong), so the soup comes out to become more salty without any sweetness of the pork to balance, making it less satisfying to eat. All the meat fillings disintegrated inside, and were mixed with other vegetables to make it taste more like a chinese dumpling (the kind that is normally boiled). The skin was very noticeably handmade and was resultantly quite thick. One commendable practice about the dumplings though is that they're made and steamed to go: you can tell as the skin swelled noticeably with the last few dumplings. \nThe pan fried pork dumplings were very impressive effortfully as the wrapper is leavened but still very thin. However, they pan fried the thin bottom instead of the thicker top, so that the dumpling isn't able to last too long in the pan. Resultantly, the wrapper's texture was less crispy and slightly too soggy than I would've liked. I did quite like the meat filling; a little sweet mmm. \nThe fried mantou is good; a classic that's hard to mess up. The mantou could've been smaller; the essence of the dish is not the mantou but to eat fried stuff and dip it with the overly sweet condensed milk. \nThe twice cooked pork was decently cooked. One question though: why have such large slices of meat? Also the dish could've benefitted from some actual peppers instead of sourcing the (weak) spice flavor from a mild hot sauce.\nOverall, the dishes are a commendable effort. I know, I'm at the more extreme end in terms of criticality. \nBut is it worth trying? Well...it's definitely not bad.\n\nFlavor: 6\nQuality: 7\nValue: 6\nService and setting: +0\nPresentation: +0\nLegitimacy, skill, and effort: +2\nMemorability: +2\nScore: 53", "author": "Alan L."}

With so many places specializing in super crispy wings, the skin on these felt a bit limp.  Only the outermost edges were crispy.  The sticky sauce was nice, with a strong star anise aroma.  Enjoyable for sure, but not as wow-worthy as the dumplings.", "author": "Adam B."}

My friend and I went today around noon, specifically for xiao long baos (which is the pork soup Dumpling). My friend arrived first and got a table relatively quick, but I think you also have the option of sharing a table if you aren't with many people, or if you're eating by yourself. The last time I came here with a friend we were served quickly because we said yes to sharing a table, and then once a table cleared up we were moved over. \n\nThe dishes we ordered were XLB, combo chow mein, spicy wontons in chili sauce, and walnut shrimp. My friend and I are big eaters (no shame) and the portion sizes were nice and filling. And I thought the actual dishes were alright and reminiscent of any other chinese restaurant. I thought the XLB was good just because I really like them, but I've had better at other places. Also the food is more Shanghai style, so you won't really find typical Chinese dim sum/dishes.", "author": "Melody Y."}

I was quite honestly hoping for more considering the rich Chinese-American history and culture that's ubiquitous with Bay Area living. But alas, I'm finding the dim sum along with many of the other Chinese restaurants lacking.\n\nYes, this is a hole-in-the-wall and you kind of get that authentic, crowded, lively atmosphere while dining that I've sorely missed from living in China so it's fun to go with friends just to get out of the usual SF hipster-ish, overpriced French or fusion-style restaurants. \n\nFood was decent. Nothing mind-blowing so I feel like most of the people who really enjoy the dim sum here are either enjoying a particular style of dim sum (I prefer Hong Kong over Shanghai / Taiwan / Guangzhou / Shenzhen) or just the overall feel of the place (cozy and you gotta get friendly with your neighbors).\n\nThe service was fine and they offer all of the usual items you'd get at dim sum oh and unlike many places, this dim sum spot actually serves dim sum for dinner as well, which is a plus for late-night dim sum lovers.\n\nParking sucks so I would definitely plan ahead and take into account you might have to park 10 blocks away depending on the time and day.\n\nParking: Limited street parking\nWait: No to little wait depending on day\nPrice: $$ Cash / Debit Card only", "author": "Pourio L."}

My quest for delicious XLB (steamed juicy pork dumplings) continues and of course, we had to look for an XLB joint 'round here in S.F. during our recent visit.  Actually quite a few options here, hard to decide which to choose to explore lol!  Einee, meenie... I finally decided on Dumpling Kitchen solely because it's right by my favorite gelato spot, Marco Polo Italian Ice Cream.  Oh YEAH... DONE!  Parking is rather difficult as it's all street parking from what I could see, and the streets are packed!  Took a good 10 minutes before i was able to find suitable sized parking spot.  Wasn't close either.  Another 10 minutes to walk there lol!  Not much of a wait to sit when we arrived for lunch on a Sunday, yay for us!  Friendly service makes for a nice initial impression, as usually, chinese restaurants are filled with gruff  unfriendly servers.  But enough of da chit chat, let's get our grub on!\n\n*STEAMED PORK DUMPLINGS (1 order $8.95 for 10):  Our XLB arrived rather promptly to our surprise. Not use to that kind of response time down in SoCal!  The thin wrapper sticks to wax paper so gotta be gentle as you pull them out or you run the risk of losing the \"juice\" inside from wrapper tears, as it happened to us a few times.  And there is quite a bit of juice inside to lose.  A PLEASANT SURPRISE!  So... GOTS TA SLOW YUR ROLL so you dont lose the perfect mix of yumminess! ;)  Tasty stuff, probably one of the better ones I've sampled in all of California.  Worth a visit just for this.\n\n*WALNUT PRAWNS:  I like that there's a bit of caramelization on the prawns.  It adds a nice texture to it rather than it just be a creamy mess.  Prawns are plump and juicy.  If you really enjoy these, may wanna consider getting more than one order.  This feeds one person a lil too easily.\n\n*GARLIC BOK CHOY:  Gotta have fiber with every meal right?  This was an ample serving to share with our family of 5.  Wonderful flavor and still quite crisp with a healthy green hue to it.  This can be filling in a good way ;)\n\n*SHRIMP FRIED RICE:  Standard stuff. Nothing wowzers to bust down the door down for, but decent enough that the plate was cleaned up by the young squires.  Not too greasy either.\n\n*CRISPY EGG PUFFS:  Never had this before and its good!  Crispy exterior and an almost kind of custardy soft inner content.  Combined, its a pleasant dessert.  No wonder its recommended by many.  I bet it doesn't taste good if you wait too long though.  That didn't happen on our table... nyahh!\n\nWe were really happy with this find!  Its the first XLB option we've sampled in this area of the world and its an easy recommendation just for those lil morsels.  Looking forward to explore more of the menu on the flip side!

Still in search of a good Shanghai Dumpling restaurant in the city after our Shanghai Dumpling King debacle earlier in the year.  Decided to visit Dumpling Kitchen five years later.\n\nWe ordered Vegetarian Goose, Shanghai Dumplings, Mushu Pork, Dry Fried Chicken Wings, and two Soy Milks, one cold, and one hot.\n\nCold Soy Milk brought out first, not filled to anywhere near the top of the glass.  Figured they were warming up the Hot Soy Milk and expected it later.  Vegetarian Goose was next and had too too much sesame oil taste in the mushroom filler.  Still no Hot Soy Milk.\n\nNext came the Mushu Pork, which was okay.  Then the waiter brought Dumplings and luckily before we touched it the Head Waitress / Cashier came over and said it was Crab and not ours and took it back to the kitchen.  She immediately came back out and presented the same dish to the next table.  We asked for the Hot Soy Milk and they said it is coming.  We see two Hot Soy Milks go out to other tables, obviously they work on one ticket at a time and ours had passed.....\n\nIn the meantime, our not too fried, too syrupy, Dry Fried Chicken Wing is served.  We ate half and boxed it.  Appears they fry their chicken without batter and put a lot of sauce on it.  Nothing close to San Tung or Korean Garlic Fried Chicken.  Pass on this order if you expect such.\n\nSo still waiting on Hot Soy Milk and Shanghai Dumpling.  Finally the Hot Soy Milk is brought out and happy that it was filled to the top.  Still no Dumplings.  \n\nAfter awhile, the Crab Dumpling table is checking out and said there is a discrepancy on their bill, they had ordered two Shanghai Dumplings (one to eat in and one to go) and were charged three.  Waiter says the \"to go\" is coming as they had already served the two \"in house\" orders.  The table said they only wanted two orders not three and had them cancel the \"to go\" since they boxed up the second \"in house\" order thinking that was the \"to go\" order.  Confused?  \n\nDing Ding....Light Bulb.. Wake-Up... Obviously you guys gave away our order early in the meal and did not realize it.  We cancelled our Dumpling order since we were disgusted with the service.  Yeah, we went to the Dumpling Kitchen and did not eat Dumplings......fail.\n\nIf you go here, be aware of questionable service, good intentions, but utter failure...food is average.  Downgraded due to service.", "author": "Scott L."}

You can just hop on the waitlist on yelp when you get there or even before on the app. We got the pan fried pork buns (mm, 10/10), the crab xlb (10/10) which was soo juicy and when you poked it, it had actual soup coming out, which compares to shanghai dumpling king as muuuch better bc their xlb's lacked juicy flavor and much soup at all. If you go during their lunch hours they have a lunch special where you can get a combo meal of rice (we got fried rice) and an entree meat like general tso's chicken. The portion for that was a lot in my opinion!! Definitely coming back.

I thought this is another Americanized Asian Fusion but most of their menu items are very authentic. The dessert buns (especially taro) are so soft that they melt in your mouth. I am most impressed by their taro buns because the filling isn't just any artificially flavored paste. I am not sure what their secret is but the filling tatses like the steamy soft taro buns from my childhood memories in Shanghai. I haven't had anything like it in two decades. The shop that sold this made fillings by squishing  real yam. I also recommnd the XLBs, pan seared bbq pork buns, and seafood potsticker. Authentic taste and seared just right. However, the seafood potstickers were a bit oily and I also ordered the shrimp toast (basically fried dough \u6cb9\u6761 with shrimp paste ), but the fried dough is way too over fried. The authentic ones are soft with some crispyness (yup, hard to describe but the best ones are found at a chain Chinese supermarket's food court Marina Foods in Cupertino/Fremont, etc).

The place isn't as big and the ambiance isn't as nice but the food totally makes up for it! \n\nDishes I recommend: \n\n-Shanghai-style Pan Fried Pork Bun's: Definitely one of my go-to's here. The bottom of the buns are perfectly crispy brown. Topped with chopped scallions with a juicy pork filling. \n    \n-XLB: Ahh.. I can never get over of how good these soup dumplings are. The dumplings were steamy with a tasty juicy pork broth. It was so good. You have to get this! \n\n-Braised Pork Belly w/ Preserved Veggies: Generous amount with the perfect amount of meat and fat ratio! This is really good with either rice or the shanghai chow mein! The preserved vegetables is a nice touch to it! This is a dish that is good enough for 2-3 people! \n\n-Shanghai Style Chow Mein: Home-made noodles, with a generous amount of vegetables & meat. The home-made noodles adds a difference. It's noodles are thick-cut and chewy. The chow mein is not too greasy either! \n\nI also tried the wontons in chili oil but it was way too oily for me. It made the wonton wrap really soggy and not very appetizing. But other than that, everything was delicious! \n\nThat's all you need to get to always want to come back!", "author": "Tiffany H."}

Waited about 15 minutes for a two top which is not bad considering it was NY day. We ordered the following: \n\nPork belly with preserved veggies- Seasoned sweet but just w the right amount. for some reason I thought it would be crispy from the photos. The portion was generous. \n\nPork and crab XLB- very good. Best I've had in SF. Meat was soft and the amount of soup inside was adequate. Advice: Put some chili oil and soy sauce. \n\nPan fried pork buns- crispy bottom, tender meat inside FTW. \n\nPork fried rice- not dry (a plus), the pork used wasn't the typical red pork used in other Chinese restaurants. \n \nSteamed sweet buns w condensed milk(what it tasted like) dipping sauce- it was ok. Buns were soft and moist. The dipping sauce was tasty just wish they gave us more. \n\nA second visit is a must.", "author": "Kai A."}

Dumpling Kitchen's name practically says it all so the minute we sat down inside the cramped restaurant, I scanned the menu like a laser for xiao long bao and found it as the first item on a long, long list of dishes. After some perusing, we also ordered a bowl of wontons in chili oil and my hubby's favorite, green onion pancake. \n\nUnlike most Asian restaurants, the service at Dumpling Kitchen was honestly quite pleasant. I suspect it stems from the fact that the servers are all young people who speak English well, allowing for easy communication. They were incredibly responsive to our requests and we barely had to ask for anything twice. Definitely a star for that!\n\nThe table was a bit small to fit all of our dishes, but we made due with what we had. The green onion pancake arrived first and both my hubby and I were a bit perplexed by the appearance, noting it looked more like fried dough than a pancake. Gone were the crepe-layers, but was instead presented like flatbread . We instantly judged the pancake to be bad before even taking the first bite, but boy, were we wrong! HOW COULD SOMETHING SO SIMPLE BE SO ADDICTIVE? Slightly chewy on the inside and super crispy on the outside, the green onion pancake quickly dwindled away as we took slice after slice, enjoying every single morsel. \n\nThen came the wicker basket of xiao long bao that looked positively delicious. Certainly the largest portion we have encountered so far, all ten dumplings were steaming hot and looked perfect. I bit off a hole in the soft dough, poured the soup onto the spoon, and took a bite of the pork filling. I may have moaned just a bit when that first bite went down because wow, was it good! The soup was plentiful and the flavor was well-developed. You could really taste the pork broth and the filling was juicy. Seeing how much I loved it, my hubby selflessly let me eat most of it, but even he had to agree, it was pretty dang tasty.\n\nBut unfortunately, the train of deliciousness came to a screeching halt at the wonton stop. The filling was fine; it was the dough that was the most problematic. The weird, grainy texture and the chalky taste made the whole dish unappetizing. It may have resulted from a reaction between the oily sauce and wonton wrapper, but after eating one, I decided to forgo the wrapper and just finish the filling. No good!\n\nStill, if we ignore the debacle that was the wontons in chili oil, everything else was marvelous. Prices were VERY cheap and portions were huge. Since Dumpling Kitchen isn't located in the crazy part of SF, I think my hubby and I will be back again. No more wontons in chili oil for us, but bring on the green onion pancake and XLBs!", "author": "Quyen L."}

We were careful not to burn our tongues, but waited a little too long that it wasn't as good so make sure to eat it hot! I also really liked the wonton in chili oil because the chili oil gives so much spice and extra flavor. Make sure to eat this while it's hot too, the dumplings do not taste good cold.

Not that the crab & pork dumplings were bad because they were great too--I just couldn't taste the difference, so I don't think it's worth the extra few dollars. \n\nPork dumplings in chili oil were also a highlight.

The dumplings, which is what this restaurant is known for, sucked. There was barely any soup in the dumpling and the bottoms are mostly ripped, so the soup was already pouring out before we even bite into them. The skin of the dumpling was mushy, and melted together with the filling, so it was like vomit texture. The shanghai styled fried buns are probably store bought, it was not authentic, and definitely undercooked. The sticky rice had very basic fillings, and it was a half assed job. Dont get me started on the green onion pancake. It was completely yellow and very weird looking, definitely not green onion pancake. Where did they buy this? Costco?!

If you come here comparing it to Din Tai Fung, please, just stop. You're comparing apples to oranges. \n\nThe XLB's always come out fresh and piping hot, so beware when eating because that soup inside the dumpling WILL burn the insides of your mouth as you take your first bite. For each XLB  order, they come with 10 pieces for about $8.95, which is really reasonable. Aside from the XLB's, I've also had their chili dumplings and shanghai style noodle. They are decent, but not something I'd crave randomly like I do with their XLB's. \n\nThe last time I came here, the staff seemed disinterested and kind of aloof, but then again, it is a Chinese restaurant, so you can't expect great service. Parking is strictly street/neighborhood only so good luck with that. Lastly, if you drive by and see a line out the door or people waiting for their name called, don't be deterred by that.

We had xiao long bao (of course), potstickers, boiled dumplings (pork), and the pan fried pork buns (sheng jian bao). All the dumplings were great. The pork buns were just okay. I've had better elsewhere (the ones at Gourmet Noodle House are SO GOOD). I lost track of how many plates we ordered, but we def ordered a LOT. And it only came out to $16 per person, which I thought was a great deal for the large quantity of dumplings that were consumed (one of my friends prides himself on being able to eat 60 or more...).\n\nAlso, I'm by no means a vinegar fanatic, but a couple of my friends are suuuuuuuuuper picky about the type/brand of black vinegar they like to eat with dumplings, so they ended up pestering our waiters quite a bit trying to get the correct type lol... after a couple of tries they finally managed to get what they were looking for (even if it was a very small cup given with attitude, which tbh was probably deserved haha since they kept sending back the \"wrong\" vinegars LOL). So.. if you're also a vinegar connoisseur, I guess you should know that they have a couple of different types of vinegar?! Fwiw, I was happy with the one they provided at the table with ginger. You can also request fresh minced garlic (which we also did... our poor waiters must have hated us).\n\nThe place is a bit of a trek but the dumplings were worth it.

I had searched and searched for a place that serves good Xiao long bao, or at least, dumplings. We had already tried House of Dumplings so we were venturing for something new. We came across Dumpling Kitchen and with that, it had a ton of good reviews with a four star rating. Bingo! \n\nParking is a pain, which can be said for everything in sunset, or better yet, San Francisco as a whole. My boyfriend dropped my grandma and me off first before he ventured out further to find parking. When we went in, there was a table immediately for a party of 3. Well, that's quick. I was expecting long lines and crazy crowds for a Saturday. \n\nWe ended up getting an order of Xiao long bao, shanghai chow mein, Beijing style dumplings with pork and chive (boiled), and fried chicken wings. \n\nThe Xiao long bao to me looked weird. It wasn't as \"full\" as I'm used to seeing them. They didn't have enough soup in them. But whatever soup they did have in them was okay. The meat was a little on the mushy side. AND their meat had hints of ginger mixed in. I prefer ginger in my vinegar, not in my dumpling. Overall, their xlb won't be remembered.\n\nThe shanghai chow mein was decent in flavor. It just had a ton of cabbage in it for whatever reason. Different regions have different styles, I suppose. \n\nThe Beijing style dumplings had sweet meat in them. Definitely not my style. I prefer savory meat. \n\nThe chicken wings had a glaze all over it and it was decent. Except the meat itself was a little bit on the tough side. \n\nThe sweet soy milk was nice here though. It was probably my favorite item from Dumpling Kitchen. \n\nDumpling Kitchen is a one and done for me. Their style of cooking and the flavors they use is just not what I'm looking for.

Here is a list of our personal favorite items:\n\nXIAO LONG BAOS \n- Eat these right away once they set it on your table!! These little things taste best when the soup is still hot as it bursts in your mouth (but don't burn yourself please)! The meat and soup inside is packed with so much flavor. \n\nShanghai styled chow mein \n- This is probably one of the underrated dishes. It is mixed with meat, cabbage, and other veggies found in regular Chinese chow mein. I love how they use thick cut noodles that are cooked to a perfect soft, chewy texture. This is the reason why I love the dish so much! It is on the greasy side but that's also probably why it tastes so good haha.\n\nFive spice beef stew noodle soup\n- I don't think I've ever had Shanghai beef noodle soup anywhere else, so this opinion is based on this dish with nothing else to compare it to. The beef is very tender and there's lots of it! The stew isn't heavy at all, it's more on the light side but still very flavorful. \n\nFRESHLY MADE SOY MILK \n- It comes in hot/cold and sweet/ savory. I prefer it cold and sweet during the meal because I tend to get quite steamy from eating the main dishes. This drink is very refreshes you and allows you to eat more dumplings!\n\nI'm not really a fan of their green onion pancakes; they're too fluffy (almost like pita bread) for my liking. The onion flavor isn't really present with every bite. The pan fried buns didn't really stand out to me either. \n\nService is like any other Chinese restaurant. You don't get treated like royalty, but they do complete all your requests and the food is great. The younger lady at the front is always nice and welcoming!", "author": "Nancy C."}

Friend and I stopped in during the mid afternoon where all the workers were folding take out menus.  There were only two other table of patrons at this odd hour.  We ordered the XLB and Beef Brisket Noodle Soup.  The waiter was very apathetic and when our food arrived, the lady just shoved our dishes on the table and walked away.  The staff pretty much ignored us the whole time and we had to get their attention to ask for things.  \n\nThe XLB didn't taste that great as the dumpling skin was thick and doughy while the pork filling was too fatty and had little flavor.  The Beef Noodle Soup came with wonton noodles instead of thick egg noodles.  The beef brisket was mostly fatty and inedible.  The only saving grace was the beef broth.  It had decent star anise flavor but probably laden with MSG.  Portions still large and tab was $19 and some change.  I'm not sure why we felt the need to even leave a more than deserving tip of 22% especially since no one acknowledged us when we got up to leave.

I personally just rub chilli sauce/paste all over it which kind of tastes like a chili wonton but flavorful soup base when you bite it.

The perfect opportunity presented itself last week when my family was visiting SF.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nWe went a little carb crazy... we ordered the sheng jian bao (pan fried dumplings), green onion pancake, dan dan noodles, wontons in chili oil, chinese ham and rice clay pot, and fried buns with condensed milk. You know, nothing really blew me away. Everything I ate, I was like \"Hm, I'm not mad at that\" yet it wasn't the best of that thing I've ever had. The most disappointing thing was probably the wontons. The wontons themselves were aiite, but the sauce was more peanut than chili oil. The dan dan noodles were on point, chewy and perfectly Q, but the sauce tasted almost like...instant noodle flavoring? It wasn't BAD, but it wasn't what you'd expect from dan dan noodles. The rice clay pot was nothing to write home about -- salty ham, salty rice. The onion pancake was like no other onion pancake I've had before. It was very flaky but not very flavorful. I guess I just prefer my green onion pancake on the denser, chewier side. Even the fried buns were like, meh. Hot. Crispy. Smothered in condensed milk, what's not to like...yet I've had better.\n\n1/1 Stars for Value --\nMost entrees cost around $10. Ideally come in a group of 4-5 and share a few dishes. You'll probably pay about $12-15 per person with tax and tip...depending on how crazy you go. \n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThis place is definitely a mom and pop shop. All the servers look like they could be family members of the owners. People are friendly here and service is fast.\n\nNo bonus star because there are better places for me to get my Chinese carb fix...", "author": "Abby W."}

I came here for lunch with a group of four on Christmas (as it was one of the few places open) and we waited for about 20 minutes before being seated at a table.\n\nFamily style is the only way to go with this type of dining--we started with the Shanghai Chow Mein, which came with strips of pork and was fairly greasy (the flavor could probably have been a little stronger). We also had the seafood fried rice, which was a nice staple dish. On the side, we had the cold cucumber salad, which was dressed with sesame oil and raw garlic--this made for a refreshing addition to an otherwise meat-heavy meal. My favorite dish was the lion's head meatball in house broth--in addition to the delicious, tender pork meatballs themselves, this dish came with mushrooms, napa cabbage, and rice noodles. The broth was so clean-tasting and warming--very delicious! Finally, we had to get a steamer full of soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Although the flavor was nice, I wouldn't say these were true soup dumplings at all, as the skin was way too thin and flimsy to hold in any of the soup!\n\nThe pluses to this restaurant are most certainly the large portions, the value, and the super quick and attentive/friendly service. The food was kind of average for a Chinese restaurant, as it was generally a little greasy and contained a fair amount of MSG. Nevertheless, this restaurant is definitely a solid bet if you're in the neighborhood and wanting some nice Chinese dishes.", "author": "David K."}

We also got the green onion pancake - wasn't anything too exceptional. \n\nIf you order pick-up make sure to ask for the chili sauce as they don't include it in your order - same goes for soy sauce if you like that on your dumplings.

It's actually 4 stars, but compared to the other places I've been to this gets a 3....eh 3.5. \n\nXLB: You're here for XLB. $8.75 for 10, not bad. Let's talk skin-soup ratio. The skin is thick. I personally don't like thick xlb skins. It makes it too doughy. But with such thick skin, I would want more soup inside. Right? Thicker skin for more stability so that the soup won't burst out. Not enough soup in this little dumpling. Size-wise, perfect. I like xlbs that can fit in my mouth. Just one bite. Still had good flavor though--sweet broth, not too salty. My favorite dumpling? Still the overly popular Din Tai Fung. They got the skin-soup ratio just right. But I ain't waiting in that line. \n\nString beans: Not bad, but a little too salty with the preserved vegetables that they use. For the best string beans though, head over to San Tung. \n\nDry Chicken Wings: Fried chicken wings then tossed in a sweet and spicy sauce. It had good flavor, but the chicken wasn't crispy enough so the sauce made it soggy. San Tung, people. \n\nSpicy Wontons: I like the wontons here actually but it was just too overcooked. The skin was too soft and lost all of it's texture. It was mushy. The spicy sauce just wasn't that burst of flavor that went bam in my mouth. Z&Y Restaurant, people. \n\nTip: If you don't want to wait in that ridiculously long Din Tai Fung line, come here for the XLB. If you don't want to wait for chicken wings at San Tung, this would be a nice alternative.", "author": "Jen P."}

My xlb expectations are a little high since I have tried many xlbs and have ate at DTF in Hong Kong in the past. I can say this place is just really mediocre. \n\nTheir XLBs are thin-skinned and freshly steamed, but the XLB lacked in soup and lacked in flavor. The skin was too soggy and the xlbs looked a little sad and droopy. No ginger is offered with your xlb vinegar sauce here either. We ordered both the regular xlb and the crab flavored xlb. The crab flavored xlb was lacking in crab flavor and all I really tasted was the little pieces of crab roe on the top and that was it. Definitely incomparable to the crab xlb from DTF as the soup there was a golden yellow. We tried their wontons in spicy sauce and it was not that good. The wontons themselves were fine, but where is the spicy mala peanut sauce that goes with them? We also ordered their braised pork belly and it was good. Very tender and fatty, a dish to go perfectly with some rice. \n\nOverall, I wouldn't say the xlbs were mind-blowing, but they do semi get the xlb cravings job done because there are not many other options in the bay area.

Really enjoyed the texture of the skin and it was filled with flavorful soup and tasty pork. I like how it was so easy to pick up with chopsticks (y'know that feels bad moment when it just tears apart and the soup start leaking out like your tears of a good dumpling gone to waste). \n\nAlso got the green onion pancake, pan fried pork buns, and wonton in chili oil. \n\nGreen Onion Pancake (3/5)\n-Different than any pancake I've ever had, was very light and crispy. Personal preference though I prefer my pancakes more dense but it was still good, just was not a standout.\n\nPan Fried Pork Buns (3/5)\n-Had a higher expectation for this dish, but the filling was 70% meat & 30% awkward hollowness, making the juices of the meat inside make the bun inside moist which I was not a fan of. The only pan fry or dry doughiness I craved from this dish was the pan fried bottom of the bun.\n\nWonton in Chili Oil (2.5/5)\nIt was meh. Skin was a bit thicker than I would have liked and the filling did not interest me as much. The chili sauce has a bit of a sweet peanutty taste. Friend said Din Tai Fung's wonton is better if you would like a comparison.\n\nWould come back for the XLB and to try other dishes they have on the menu though! Left feeling really satisfied.

It was kind of soggy and not crunchy. I was disappointed that there was no sauce that came with it. The bok choy was pretty good though! I could really taste the smoky wok flavor inside the bok choy, but it was very greasy. I was extremely disappointed in the XLBs. First of all, the top of the XLBs were very doughy, almost as though they didn't cook fully. Second of all, they were not as juicy as I hoped it would be. The dough surrounding the XLB was also pretty thick, so it ruined the experience for me. Lastly, these XLBs were very small... The only good part of it was the meat that was inside. The Pork and Chive dumplings were pretty good. The meat inside was flavorful and seasoned well. \n\nThey specialize in dumplings, so I would just stick with those the next time I come here.

The dry cured ham fried rice tasted as if someone used acid to wash the ham, then just plunked it into a vat of salt, how the hell can you call yourself a chef if you don't even know how to make the most basic of chinese salt-cured staples?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-22", "description": "Some people like to wait hours for a certain super hyped up Shanghai dumpling place. Don't get me wrong, that certain place's food is quite charming, it's just that it's a tad hyped ;) But sometimes the hole in the walls are the places to hit. Dumpling Kitchen is one of those good hole in the walls.\n\nI've been here 2 times already in the span of 2 months. And 6 times since it opened. This place is extremely solid. True, it's doesn't have the modern interior design appeal of some places, but who cares when you get good food?\n\nOn this particular occasion, I brought 2 friends to try this place for lunch. We ordered the following:\n\nSHANGHAI-STYLE STEAMED PORK DUMPLINGS ($8.50): You get 10 pieces of scrumdiddlyumptious Shanghai Dumpling or Xiao Long Bao. Each one is a soup wrapped bundle of joy. Each dumpling has delicious pork and chives filled with soup. The skin is not too thin, and not too thick. They are pretty sizable compared to other places.  DIRECTIONS: The way to eat these involves (1) plucking one out with your chopstick (2) placing it on your soup spoon (3) placing vinegar and chopped ginger on top (you gotta ask for some) (4) taking small bites while sipping the soup. Now you can eat Shanghai Dumplings like a PRO! Don't be an amateur and plop the whole thing in your mouth; you'll only burn your tongue have have all your friends laugh at you. This is a must have if you come here!\n\nSHANGHAI-STYLE PAN-FRIED PORK BUNS ($8.50): This is by far one of my most favorite of all Shanghai-inspired dishes and this place really delivered. They put a good amount of meat and chives into a bun that is perfectly sized for your mouth. It's a perfect combination of opposites: (1) the top of the bun is super soft and the bottom is nice and crispy, but not burnt (2) the super juicy center is complemented with the soft and absorbent texture of the bun. Best of all, it came out nice and piping hot! Writing this review right now makes my mouth water at the thought! This is another must have!\n\nDRY-FRIED CHICKEN WINGS ($10.00): Not the best thing on the menu, but it sure looked good on our neighboring table's wait. The chicken was prepared OK, but the sauce had a bit too much star anise for my taste and the chicken wing could have been a bit crunchier. You can safely pass on this if you come, but it doesn't hurt to try.\n\n-SCORE BREAKDOWN--\n\nSERVICE: 4 stars--they were solid; not bad and not amazing.\nAMBIANCE: 3 stars--nothing special but hey, it's cleaner than your typical Chinese restaurant.\nFOOD: 4.5 stars--one of the best pan-fried pork bun places that I've been to and a very solid Shanghai Dumpling.\nPRICE: 4.5 stars--it's a suitable price for an excellent meal.\nTOTAL: 4 stars for an excellent meal.\n\nBottom Line: Want a good meal to fill your hungry belly? Better yet, want a great place to try Shanghai Dumplings and pan-fried pork buns at an extremely reasonable price? This place will not disappoint. I'm coming here for the foreseeable future!", "author": "Andrew C."}

Dozens and dozens of dumplings.\n\nTo paint the background, I've only consumed soup dumplings (xiao long bao, XLB, whatever you wanna call 'em) in limited contexts: Shanghai Dumpling King in SF, Din Tai Fung in LA and Taiwan, and random restaurants in East Bay (anyone from Fremont remember San Liu Jiu in that Warm Springs plaza near the freeway intersection? haha) and China.\n\nDumpling Kitchen's xiao long bao remind me of those at San Liu Jiu. My family frequented that restaurant fairly often, and little bitty me didn't know much more about xiao long bao aside from the metal steamers we would order from that restaurant. So, if my parents approved of those, they would definitely approve of these.\n\n#1: $8.25 for a steamer full of 10 Shanghai-style steamed pork dumplings, each one consistently full of soup at the right temperature with dumpling skins not too dry and pork fillings salted just right. The wrappers are thicker than those at Din Tai Fung, the xiao long bao champion, but Dumpling Kitchen makes for a pretty good substitute. And, yes, these are WAY better than Shanghai Dumpling King. Hands down don't even question. However, I have yet to compare it to Kingdom of Dumpling.\n\nWe also ordered #5: $8.25 for 10 Shanghai-style pan-fried pork buns, also called sheng jian bao, which are heavier than xiao long bao due to being fried rather than steamed, as well as the thicker breading. The buns here outshine those at Shanghai Dumpling King by nature of less breading and a nicely fried bottom--thick breading at the bottom makes for a nice crispy layer that can soak up the juices, but too much breading all around makes the buns way too dense (so many inappropriate jokes to be made, not enough time). If only these buns had soup for those bottoms to absorb! Needs more juice, sigh.\n\nFam fav for sheng jian bao in Shanghai? Xiao Yang Sheng Jian, or Yang's Friend Dumplings. You're welcome.\n\nPer Yelper recs, we also got #103: $10.25 braised pork belly with preserved vegetables. Huge portion, absolutely delicious. Get this. GET THIS. And thanks Yelp :)\n\n$1.25 or $1.50 for a small bowl of white rice.\n\nClosed Wednesdays.\n\nUntil Din Tai Fung opens up at Westfield Valley Fair, I will take my parents to Dumpling Kitchen.", "author": "Adele F."}

It looks like a real hole-in-the-wall dumpling place on Taraval St near a residential area, but inside is pretty brightly lit and clean.\n\nThey specialize in Shanghainese dumplings - my uncle ordered for the entire table.  Overall I think the food is 3.5 stars, so rounding up to four for attentive service.  Dishes I tried were pretty good!\n\nLion Head soup: This is a large bowl that has a gigantic, soft meatball submerged in broth, rice noodles, and shredded cabbage.  The meatball was cooked through, with slightly pink center.  Incredibly soft and juicy - you don't have to chew much.\n\nGreen Beans: Crunchy and good, nuff said.\n\nXiao Long Bao: Pretty good sized and juicy, but lacking sufficient broth inside.\n\nDan Dan Mian: Sauce was spicy and good, but I think there was too much of it compared to noodles.  Noodles on the soft side - I prefer some chew.\n\nChow Lien Go: Similar to chow fun, but with far less oil and interesting, firmer and chewier noodle pieces - shaped like little paddles.\n\nChinese Donut: Similar to a Beignet - I really liked the eggy interior, but the skin was softer and could have used some more crispiness. Koi Palace in Dublin has a pretty good version.\n\nPan Fried XLB?: Not sure what these are called, but they were decent - like a round pork potsticker.\n\nI would consider coming back to try their other offerings, since they have a good sized menu.

Although these were not the best XLB that I've had, they were pretty good for what I can get in the States.  The skin is a bit thicker than Din Tai Fung and had more of a homemade dumpling skin kind of flavor and chewiness.  But, the flavor of the soup inside it was definitely set it apart from other XLB's that I've had in the US.  The soup inside is a little more greasy than what you might get from Din Tai Fung, but was rich with flavor.  Wish they had the thinly sliced ginger though to accompany it!\n\nWe also ordered the steamed vegetarian dumplings, which I enjoyed, and the pan-fried steamed pork buns (the dough is slightly sweet which makes it the perfect bao--these are pretty filling though!).  As some others have mentioned, the chili wontons were not the best (although they were alright and are always a favorite order of mine).  We also ordered the snow pea leaves (yum!) and shanghai-style stir-fried rice cakes.\n\nService was not spectacular--but what do you expect?

Consistently delicious food for when nothing but XLB will do.\n\nFOOD: NOMZ. Skip the standard American-Chinese fare here and go for the gold with the authentic stuff. Obviously the xiaolong bao are a must; I prefer the pork to the crab, which have a fishy taste. The Shanghai Sheng Jian Bao (pan fried buns) are also delicious and make *delicious leftovers*. The Shanghai stir fried rice cakes are also very tasty, and the garlic eggplant is *amazing* - NOT overly oily or sweet like other places. Finally another MUST is the braised pork belly with preserved vegetables - definitely make sure you have some steamed white rice to soak up the sauce/melted fat. The green onion pancake is tasty but seems to be made of a batter rather than a dough - not my personal preference. They also have tons of noodle soups - definitely want to try these in the future.\n\nAMBIENCE: A little cramped, loud, and bright. This is not the place for a romantic candlelit first date. But definitely a good spot to go with family and friends for a casual but delicious meal.\n\nSERVICE: Get here early or be prepared to wait! There are a handful of large round tables, and the rest are 4-person or 2-person tables. I believe they take reservations for larger parties, so definitely try calling ahead. Otherwise, the wait can be anywhere from 15-45 minutes depending on the time/day.

Dumpling Kitchen is ridiculously delicious and one of the top spots in the Outer Sunset.\n\nFor a place that gets so packed on the daily basis, the service remains top notch here. I mean seriously, these guys literally are walking out of the kitchen every few seconds with food. It makes sense, as they need to work quick when there's a full house, but I commend them for putting on a show when I was there. It was like free entertainment while I ate!\n\nOn to the food: 1 word. Fantastic.\n\nI waited about 10-15 minutes to get seated when I first arrived (which actually is very reasonable for a Dim Sum spot at lunch time), and about 5 minutes after my order was placed, my food started coming out (see my earlier statement on how fast these guys are). I ordered a bunch of stuff: XLB, veggie pot-stickers, spring rolls, chow mien with beef, chicken with rice, etc. I can't compliment the cooks enough. Every single dish that came out was perfectly made. It was perfection and it's finest.\n\nNow, a question that may come up for people that live further away from here: Is it worth my time to drive all the way here for an experience I can get elsewhere? YES! First of all, this spot makes some of the best XLB you'll ever have. You can say they have nailed the recipe. Secondly, it's affordable, especially for the food you're getting. Thirdly, the service is quick and reliable. Plus, wouldn't you want to stop by the beach afterwards and take a relaxing stroll alongside the water so you can work off all that food? Point made.\n\nFinal verdict: Dumpling Kitchen offers the full Dim Sum experience. Incredible food, shorter wait times compared to similar spots, fast service, and reasonable pricing.

The line picked up considerably by 12:30 - 1 pm though, so aiming for noon or earlier on a weekend would probably be ideal.\n\n\"A little bit of everything\" summed up our meal as we tried to get a taste of all the standards to get a gauge of the chef's skills.  Both the classic and crab xiao long bao were very well done - thin dumpling skins just resilient enough to be picked up that opened up to flavorful pork swimming in a mini-sea of juice.  Likewise, my brother and I were blown away by how thin and perfectly crisped the pan-fried pork buns and pot stickers were.\n\nShanghai-style chow mein was on point as well and reminded me of one of my favorite iterations when I was growing up.  For heartier dishes, I'd highly recommend both the lion's head in either preparation for its crazy tender meat and delicate flavors as well as the pork belly with preserved vegetables.  The latter may be too lean for some, but I really enjoyed the balance between the fatty layers and leaner, yet plenty tender meat.\n\nAnd for rice lovers, I was pleasantly surprised by the texture of the clay pot rice served with greens mixed in and topped with smoked ham.  Really tasty and it paired well with all the meat dishes.  Lastly, the mildly sweet soy milk was great and a similarly great pairing.\n\nWhat ultimately rounded out our awesome meal though was the quality of the staff.

It doesn't have the traditional carts that are wheeled around probably because the location is relatively small, but the dumplings are awesome nonetheless. I have been here twice now at noon on a Saturday and both times the service was fast and I was able to order plenty to eat. Both times we were seated immediately. The price is very reasonable. The main drawback of this place is parking in the neighborhood is very limited.\n\nRecommendations:\n\nThe soup dumplings (Shanghai dumplings) are excellent. They give you a pop of delicious broth when you bite into them.\n\nThe pork dumplings\n\nThe pork and chives dumplings\n\nThe green onion pancake\n\nI would arrive earlier if possible because this place does get very busy on the weekends in the afternoon.", "author": "Molly M."}

They're dimpled one-bite wonders that are soft and squishy and filled with all sorts of tasty treasures. What's not to like? And Xiao Long Baos...does anyone else wanna poke 'em until they explode? I resist though and delicately cradle them with my chopsticks and pop 'em into my mouth. Then comes that wonderful 10 seconds of delicious dumpling bliss as the flavors envelop your mouth and fill you with that warm fuzzy foodie feeling.\n\nThe two must-get dumplings to get here are of course, the traditional Xiao Long Bao soup dumplings, and their plump little homies - the pan fried pork dumplings. They're puffier versions of the XLB with a thicker skin and less liquid. Each order comes with 10 dumplings for ~$7.50, which is usually enough for 1-1.5 people depending on your fatty status.\n\nOther popular picks are the braised pork belly, dry fried chicken wings, green beans, and green onion pancake, which is light and crisp. The rest of the menu doesn't really impress me. I've had the Chinese ham and bok choy clay pot it's basically just slabs of ham, chopped bok choy, and white rice that gets dully crisp on the edges. There's no gravy to bring the dish together. The fried rice, chow mein, and Shanghai style rice cakes are all just okay too. I wouldn't recommend any of them to order specifically, but they're good filler type of side entrees. \n\nDumpling Kitchen is your typical hole-in-the wall with plain decor and mediocre service, but the awesome dumplings make up for it all. I like coming here for brunch on the weekends. There's hardly ever a line and if there is, it's usually 10-15 minutes. One of my go-to dumpling spots!", "author": "Deanna Y."}

We ordered the rice cake, green beans, XLBs, and combo noodles. The sauce of the rice cake and combo noodle dishes were the same, so next time we'll just stick with the rice cakes probably. No complaints re green beans. And most importantly, the XLBs were super soupy, warm, and omg delicious. I thought Shanghai Dumpling King was good (yes, they all have similar names), but this place just upped the standard by a notch. I have only come here only once so I can't comment about the consistency of the soupiness, but seeing how this place is highly rated on yelp, there must be a reason. \n\nAs for parking, there was plenty of street parking. The wait-to-be-seated is a bit unpredictable though. The waiting area is pretty small so expect to stand outside. There are not that many interesting shops nearby, so either choose to come during odd hours of the day, or prepare to wait. Lots of city people come here for the XLBs probably.

You have to use the hot sauce at the table to go with this dish.. The hot sauce is out of this world.  Gives you the perfect kick.  It's hard to find the sticky rice roll and I finally found a place near me that has it. The sticky rice roll has the chinese donut in since with flossy pork as well.  The perfect combo to go with the sweet soy milk, which they serve hot.  The rice cakes here with pork is also really good.  You can tell they use really good ingredients because the pork didn't have any fat in it.  They use lean pork to make their dishes, which makes me feel healthier.  The Egg puff is reminds me so much of the ones in Hong Kong, except its missing the red bean paste that the ones in Hong Kong has.

I now know from other Yelp reviews they serve it but not for us! \n\n(1/2 star demerit). \n\nThe one entree my little boy *insisted* on ordering - beef with broccoli- he ate the generous slices of tender beef but left all but one daintily nibbled broccoli floret for me to eat.\n\nAnd I swear there was an entire head of broccoli in the entree- florets only- along with a side of dry braised green beans.

Really, they could throttle way back and it'd still be a solid deal). \n\nAnd for the record, I made the leftover broccoli and braised green beans a dinner unto themselves the following evening.\n\nTo finish, we waited 15 minutes for the kitchen to make their fabled Egg Puffs for dessert. As tired as my 7 year-old was after a full week of school, he wanted to wait for this highly-touted item; he wanted dessert. \n\nAnd were the Egg Puffs worth it- OMG!\n\nYorkshire pudding eggy-ness but hot hot hot, a lil greasy (in the most delicious way) and dusted with confectioners' sugar.\n\nIf you had to wait in line IN THE RAIN, order some Egg Puffs and consume them immediately while they're hot. \n\nYes, they're that delicious.

Dumpling Kitchen, Kingdom of Dumpling, King of Noodles, House of Pancakes\n\n[THE DUMPLINGS]\n\nI must say though, among the various Kitchens and Kingdoms and Houses, Dumpling Kitchen's XLB are the best I've had in SF/SSF.  I admit to being an absolute snob about XLB with ridiculously high standards based on XLB excursions in Asia, but Dumpling Kitchen has it just right: \n\n1. The skin must push the boundaries of being delicately thin (I know, a true delicacy =P) without falling apart and spewing out the insides when you pick it up\n2. The broth must be flavorful, arguably ramen-grade\n3. The pork should be succulent and savory, but not rely completely on fat because then it gets heavy and makes you just feel uncomfortably fatty and full after a few dumplings\n\nWe also got the cabbage and pork dumplings which were amazing as well, satisfying the same criteria as XLB minus the soup and plus the cabbage.\n\n[THE NON-DUMPLINGS]\n\nBecause it seemed strange to only eat dumplings for dinner (though after my first visit I would have been totally happy with that), we got the pork and leek stir-fry dish, which was more delicious than it sounds, as is the case for most Chinese dishes.  The portion was generous and I liked how there was a lot of leek.  The cooking style was homemade, though I personally would have preferred that they don't use sugar (yes I'm such a health freak... being a fan of leeks and complaining about sugar).\n\n[THE SERVICE/AMBIANCE/MISC]\n\nIt has the typical Parkside nice Chinese restaurant vibe--no flashy alters with phoenixes and dragons, but not a dingy hole-in-the-wall looking like it serves street food.  Service was courteous as well (FYI they speak Canto and Mandarin), and I liked how the waitress was honest when we asked whether we could request lean meat for twice cooked pork and she said it was only pork belly which had strips of fat.  Prices are great too, with almost everything under $10 (makes Park Tavern across the street seem really pricey for dinner)\n\nI'll be back!  In my opinion, Dumpling Kitchen is too modest of a name for such amazing dumplings--they should reign the SF dumpling turf as the King of Dumplings or Dumpling Palace.", "author": "Edna C."}

The first thing that came out was the beef noodle soup. It was very light and the meat was cooked tender and seasoned well. Next came the saut\u00e9ed string beans and they were light with a crunch although there could've been seasoned a little more. The steamed vegetable dumpling was really juicy and tasty. The dried fried chicken wings were crunchy and tender but I think their sauce could be sticker or thicker possibly. The Shanghai chow mein had beef, chicken, shrimp, and mixed vegetables! I was surprised how there were so many things mixed into this dish! \n\nMy favorites were the dumplings of course! We had the Shanghai-style steam pork dumplings (XLB) which are my absolute favorite.

I'm finally getting to the point after a 6 month adventure in South East Asia, that I want to eat and enjoy deep Asian flavors again. We came across Dumpling Kitchen on Yelp and since had never ventured out to the Sunset before, the decision was easy to make! \n\nIt was one of those nights I ate to the point of being sick, but it was so easy to do. We ordered way too much food. The wait wasn't long on a Friday night although the restaurant was pretty packed. I'd say expect about at least a 15 minute wait. This restaurant is friendly for large parties, too. There was a birthday in the house. The servers were fast to set up our tables, serve up hot green tea, and take our orders. \n\nDUMPLINGS\n- We ordered one of the steamed Shanghai pork dumplings. These were amazing. I had a spot back home where I'd go for pork soup dumplings and these were definitely reminiscent of my old go-to. It took me to my happy place. The wraps are on the thinner side and the dumplings are kind of small. But the portion was plenty to share between the beau and I. \n- Pork dumplings in chili oil. After having the Shanghai pork ones, these didn't quite provoke the same excitement and burst of flavor. It was toned down and very little chili oil. I guess maybe I was imagining them to be more like wontons in chili oil that I've had before - just doused with that shiny red oil. The meat flavor was kind of muted, too. Not bad, just doesn't stand well against the Shanghai ones. \n\nSZECHUAN BEEF\n- Great flavor with tender beef bites and I really loved the sauteed cucumber. I'm not sure what that's about because I've never seen a stir fry done this way before, but it actually worked pretty well. Our only complaint about this was that they really didn't do justice with szechuan spice level. They just sparingly threw one or two fried red chilies on there. Boyfriend had to add a lot more hot sauce to get it up to his level. A side of rice was a must with this plate for us. \n\nNOODLES IN PEANUT SAUCE\n- So they forgot about my order for these noodles, which honestly I wish I had just left it at that. The noodles were more Ramen style which I didn't expect. The serving size it ginormous, but my disappointment with this dish was that it barely had any flavor. It was really gummy and I had expected a sweet peanut sauce. This was a weird half savory half- inexplicable. I have no knowledge on this dish, so I can't speak to it much. But I had expected something completely different Kind of like a dan dan noodle in sweet peanut sauce. This was not that at all. \n\nSWEET BUNS\nAmazing. She asked whether we wanted it steamed for fried, and since there was so much damage already done. What the hell. Fried, please. It comes in 4 small buns that were SUPER fresh. We had to let it cool, so as not to burn our fingers. The sugar sweet on the side and the fried bread was just a great finish to our awesome meal. \n\nThe Shanghai dumplings alone are a reason to come back.

Thick noodles with perfectly saut\u00e9ed cabbage and other yum yums. Not oily or overly seasoned. Just right. \n\nEveryone in the place had an order of the dry braised string beans on their table. Noticed this dish was a highlight to many yelpers. Was not disappointed. Cooked well but still very crispy. Not oily or saucey. Just tasty, garlicky, healthy string beans. Very good! \n\nThe #1: Shanghai style steamed pork dumplings are one of their signature dishes. (Also known as the XLB dumplings.) A must have dish. These dumplings are better than most but not the absolute best I've ever had. But second to the best I've ever had. That said, they're the best dumplings in the neighborhood. \n\nThe #5: Shanghai style pan fried pork buns seemed the most risky to me but were outstanding! Similar to the #1 with the sensual, steaming hot broth inside. But with a sweet tasting pan seared bottom and thicker dumpling wrapper than the #1. Slightly different but oh so delectable! \n\nUpon sitting they brought hot tea and roasted peanuts. It's a nice welcome gesture. One thing I found to be true from other yelp reviews is the necessity to flag down the servers. Under normal circumstances I would never do that. But seeing as this is the MO here, it was an imperative procedure to ordering and getting the check. \n\nOverall, a pleasant and mouth watering dining experience without being too expensive.

It would be cool if they could somehow put more soup into the dumplings here though.\n\nOther popular items here won't disappoint either. Their chicken wings are decent but not comparable to San Tung's. I like their green onion pancake because it's not oily, but Kingdom's is still better. The stir fried rice cakes are great too but it would be better if they fried it a little more to make it crispier.

The potstickers saved the day with its thinner skin and more flavorful meat. Other friends got the chicken chow mein and it was huge portions and the other friend got their beef stew noodles and completely demolished it signifying it was probably pretty decent.\n\nThe service is slow and they tried to tell us not to sit down since their kitchen was closing in 30 mins (which I think is a reasonably long time from then because we got there at 8:30 and they close at 9:30).

The rice cakes are very thin and mixed in with delicious vegetables and pork. \nXLB - I came here for the soupy dumplings and they did not disappoint.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-01", "description": "I love xiao long bao. If you haven't had them before, they're basically dumplings that contain soup inside. I don't know why, but I love that. There's something fun about trying to eat dumplings without spilling the soup inside the dumplings all over my plate. It's like a little challenge I don't get tired of. So when I read reviews about how great the xiao long bao were here, I had to go try them.\n\nMy family and I spent forever deciding on what we wanted to get. And I think the other customers thought we were weird because we kept looking around to see what everyone was eating. I'd tell my sister, \"That looks good. What do you think that is?\" And every time a server brought out another dish, we'd go, \"Ooh, that looks good.\"\n\nWe finally decided to order one order of xiao long bao which are Shanghai style steamed pork dumplings, a plate of the dry braised string beans with rice (lunch special), Beijing style boiled pork and chive dumplings, seafood chow mein, and a glass of sweet soy milk. \n\nThe xiao long bao were as good as the reviews say. The dumplings were served in a wooden bamboo tray in a set of 10. They were warm and filled with delicious soup and pork with a hint of ginger. I hope to return soon and order them again. \n\nThe Beijing style boiled pork and chive dumplings were okay, but they didn't amaze me like the xiao long bao. Maybe it's because the dumplings weren't as flavorful. These dumplings were filled with pork and chive and also a hint of ginger. \n\nThe dry braised string beans with rice was also very delicious. It was part of their lunch special and I felt that it was a generous portion. The dry braised string beans were stir fried with finely chopped onions and preserved vegetables, which enhances its flavors. This dish was very flavorful and more on the salty side, but perfect if you're eating with rice. I did feel that they were a little bit on the oily side. However, if you're okay with that, this is definitely a plate you should consider ordering. \n\nThe seafood chow mein was delicious, but also a little more on the oily side. It was filled with fried fish filets and shrimp along with chopped yellow and green onions and julienned carrots. The noodles aren't the thin egg noodles but the thicker lo mein type of noodles. It was tasty and flavorful and I would consider ordering it again.\n\nThe sweet soy milk was nothing special. It was slightly sweetened and warm and perfect with the meal. I would have enjoyed it more if I weren't so full from the rest of my meal.\n\nA few tips regarding this place. It is extremely crowded. There is a constant line out the door. Make sure to write your name on the waitlist the moment you get there. Also you want to open to the idea of sharing a large table with other guests. If you're not, it might take a lot longer for your group to be seated since it's always filled. Although they didn't charge me, the bottom of the menu does recommend that we bring our own containers. If we don't, we get charged 25 cents per container. I have never seen that before so my family and I had a good laugh when we saw that little fine print at the bottom.\n\nI recommend coming here if you're a fan of dumplings. They have a good selection of them. But they also have a large selection of other foods too. You have a lot of choices to pick from. A little pricy for the dumplings but it's so worth it because that's what they're known for. So definitely give this place a try. But be prepared for the wait.", "author": "Andrea G."}

I recently went in with my boyfriend for a late dinner. Even though it was a weeknight, it was still pretty busy. Thankfully, we got the second to last table before it was at full capacity. \n\nWe ordered the XLB, shredded pork with string beans, and Shanghai-style pan-fried rice cakes. First, the XLB was on point. It came out hot, but didn't scald our tongues upon first bite. It was juicy, meaty, and the dumpling wrapper wasn't too thin or too thick. The soup came out runny, savory, and slightly sweet. Now, as a couple other Yelpers noted, I was shocked to find there wasn't the signature slivered ginger and soy sauce-vinegar mixture to dip in. That was a total bummer. I was looking forward to having that sit on my spoon with the XLB. Oh well. Nevertheless, the XLB themselves were delicious. Second, the shredded pork with string beans were tasty. I was surprised they weren't cooked down a little more. Typically, these long beans are stir fried until the skins are a little more wrinkled. (Maybe they're not the same type of string beans?) At any rate, the dish was very good and, of course, was even better with a steaming cup of jasmine rice. Third, the pan-fried rice cakes were pretty good: fair balance of meat and vegetables. It needed a tad more salt to round it out though. \n\nService was efficient. Dinner came with your standard hot tea. Overall, Dumpling Kitchen is 4-star material: solid value, good portions, all-around tasty.", "author": "James Z."}

I'd visit Dumpling Kitchen over Shanghai Dumpling King and Kingdom of Dumplings any day of the week (give me a note if there's another dumpling place I should try). \n\n+ Food: The XLB, pan fried buns and green onion pancake are all VERY good. The real must try here is the Egg Puff Doughnuts. HOLY CRAP! These things must be the pride of the Kitchen. I actually ask the waitress to bring those out before any of the other food. I don't mess around with my desserts and I can't have all this delicious chinese food fill up my Egg Puff Doughnut stomach. Order it. You won't regret it.\n  \n+ Service: The staff is very nice and the kitchen is very fast. This place can get crazy busy but the servers all keep their cool like real professionals and get people in and out. Props to the team for bringing their A game each and everyday.\n\n+ Experience: The whole experience is just phenomenal. The restaurant is larger than both Shanghai Dumpling King and Kingdom of Dumplings. They can accommodate large groups and I believe they also accept reservations. Parking isn't too bad in the area and also right off the L line. \n\nAbsolutely a 5 star establishment. I come here just for those tasty Egg Puffs.

There was chicken, green and white onion, and carrots. The dish had an overall tasty flavor. \n\nThe green onion pancake was definitely different than the regular crispy green onion pancake. This green onion pancake was huge, light, and fluffy! It reminded me of the Indian naan bread. I think I prefer the regular crispy green onion pancake that I am used to having. I like the texture and overall taste better. I felt like this green onion pancake was lacking in flavor. It was bland and did not have a lot of green onion in it. \n\nThe soy milk (savory) was also bland. I have tried this before at a different restaurant and it tasted better there. However, I do prefer the plain sweet soy milk over the savory. We wanted to try something different so we tried the savory. The savory soy milk has Chinese fried donut in it already, along with drops of chili oil. \n\nThe dry-fried chicken wings were tasty.

There are a lot of tables so the wait is never too long and I'm sure they offer community seating if you're up for it! Service is also pretty fast considering they have to steam all and (possibly) pan fry all their dumplings. I ordered to-go so the young lady helping me was really nice and gave me some good recommendations.\n\nI ended up ordering their pork XLB (aka the Shanghai style steamed pork dumplings), pan fried pork and chive pot stickers, green onion pancake, steamed pork and napa cabbage dumplings, and pork dumplings in chili oil.\n\nXLB: Not the best I've ever had, unfortunately. It was EXTREMELY SALTY!! The skin was nice and thin and the soup burst in your mouth upon eating it, but, I didn't care for the actual soup nor did I like the sauce they provided me with. It was a sweetened soy sauce and vinegar mixture versus the usual red vinegar with thinly sliced ginger. I guess I should have asked for it since I ordered to-go. (FYI I tried their XLB right when I stepped in my car so it was still fresh!)\n\nPan fired pork and chive pot stickers (aka pan fried pot stickers) and Pork dumplings in Chili Oil: BOTH ARE A MUST TRY! Crispy on the bottom, skin was just right (not too thick and not too thin), filling was nice and juicy--I LOVED everything about these!! (Luckily, I had two orders!!) Again, the sauce they give for the spicy version (since both pot stickers are the same one just comes with spicy chili oil) wasn't all that great and more on the sweet side versus spicy. I preferred eating them plain or dipping them in siracha sauce.\n\nSteamed pork and napa cabbage dumplings: similar to the pan fried pork and chive dumplings except they use napa cabbage instead and it's steamed. Pretty good but I miss that crunchy texture the pan fried pot stickers have. Unless you really like napa cabbage---you can pass on these!\n\nGreen onion pancake: SUPER OILY!!!!! I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THESE!!! (Refer to my picture of the bag they were given to me in--it's almost see-through due to the amount of oil they use to cook it!!) Wasn't all that great either... similar to naan but I'd rather have garlic naan ANY DAY over this!!\n\nOverall, a decent place to go for dumplings but they really need to improve on their sauces! Using a sweet soy sauce with vinegar mixture for everything  is a no-go! I'd rate their food a 3.5-4/5.", "author": "Steph M."}

In the bay area there really isn't that many restaurants with memorable XLBs. I came here on a Sunday night and there was a short wait (20-30 mins) which really isn't that bad considering that SF is a city where waiting in line is part of the norm. We ordered the garlic with shoots, wontons in chili oil, and XLB. The wontons tasted exactly like the XLD in a different skin and soupless. But then again the XLB we got were dried on top (tip was doughy and hard) and the soup was barely there. Normally the XLB is served with ginger and vinegar but this place only had vinegar.

The restaurant itself isn't wide, but it's sort of long when you get inside and bathrooms are located all the way on the inside. \n\nService here is really hit and miss.

It was the right amount of of juiciness and the texture was great. Really well made! I came here at 8:25 and was half expecting to be rejected for a table. Luckily, we were seated and the whole experience eating here was quite enjoyable. For a party of two, we ended up 10 pork XLBs and the Shanghai style noodles. Oh my god, those noodles were so chewy in texture AND savory in flavor, it was definitely a match made in heaven with my tastebuds' preferences. Anyway, the food came out fairly quickly and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Will most definitely come back again.

Many Asian foodies will wax poetic about how wonderful and amazing XLB is. Unfortunately, I haven't had that many and I haven't found one that lives up to the hype.\n\nThat being said, I do think Dumpling Kitchen is an A-OK place to get your fix. They are flavorful and do have a nice delicate skin with the soup inside. However, I would like to have more soup inside. In addition, if you wait too long to eat them (or if you take too long to reach the end of the platter), the soup seems to magically disappear. I assume it soaks into the meat or skin, which is disappointing.\n\nYou can also get other Chinese foods here, but I do think it's a bit bland. But most people won't want an entire meal of dumplings, so the other options are here.\n\nService is pretty barebones, but fairly polite for a Chinese restaurant. They'll bring your tea, take your order, bring your food out, and that's about it. Time between ordering an getting your food is highly dependent on how busy the restaurant is. Expect to wait if you come for lunch on the weekend, especially with a big party.\n\nSadly I'm still on the prowl for a magical XLB that will knock my socks off.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-22", "description": "We had a pretty large group here last night for a couple of friends' birthdays. For the value, Dumpling Kitchen was pretty good. It's no Michelin star restaurant but a satisfying combination of price, portion, and flavor.\n\nXLB - The skins were way better than I expected at this price point. Their texture was smooth with the right amount of firm chewiness. Just from looking at them, the fine folds at the top was a good sign that the skins would be thin and delicate. They also didn't break open when picked up with chopstick. Not much to complain about there. The stuffing was not the best but still decent for a low end restaurant. The texture of the pork was on the grittier side, and I thought it could've had more ginger and green onions mixed in for more brightness. The broth was similar to the pork stuffing in that it could be brighter and bolder, but it still had good body and was seasoned with enough salt . The broth was also on the fattier side, which doesn't bother me, but I know some people out there prefer cleaner XLB broths. \n\nBraised Pork Belly with Pickled Vegetables - You can tell this restaurant probably isn't run by Shanghainese people because of kitchen staff yelling at each other in Cantonese, and this is reflected in some of the menu items. This braised pork belly dish is a traditional Hakka classic from southern China, far from Shanghai. Dumpling Kitchen's rendition is actually pretty good. The pork belly was tender, and the sauce was a good balance of sweetness and pickled earthiness. My favorite place to order this is at Hakka Restaurant in the Outer Richmond. If I had to compare the two, Hakka's sauce is thicker and richer with a more complex spice mixture. There's a slight orange peel flavor in Hakka's that separates it from the rest. Despite not being as good as Hakka's, I would have no qualms with getting the pork belly here. \n\nGreen Onion Pancakes - Not really my cup of tea. They have the lighter and fluffier version of green onion pancakes, and I didn't think it had much green onion flavor. It kinda just tasted doughy. The crispy and layered green onion pancakes are way better.\n\nVegetarian Potstickers - There was a vegetarian in our group so we had an order of vegetarian potstickers. I was kinda surprised because they turned out to be pretty tasty. I probably liked them more than the pork and chive dumplings. There's a good amount of shiitake mushrooms to give it a lot of umami and earthy flavors. They also put in dried tofu (doufu gon), and it's firmer texture and five spice flavor paired well with the other ingredients in the stuffing.\n\nNoodles with Black Bean Sauce - Not good. Sauce was not very savory and didn't taste black bean-y. Noodles were mushy and gross. Skip this.\n\nEgg Puffs (Sah Yong) - Freshly fried and really delicious. They were light, airy, and full of eggy goodness. If I had to complain about something, it's that instead of surrounding the donuts in sugar, it's just poured all on top of the donuts. I just rolled the donut around to get the sugar everywhere.", "author": "Nei N."}

It was pretty solid the first time so it was worth another visit.\n\nAs compared to Kingdom of Dumpling and Shanghai Dumpling King, Dumpling Kitchen has a small dumpling selection with just 4 choices aside from wontons but I really like their XLBs (10 pieces - $6): http://bit.ly/UGCdW8. Arriving in a bamboo steamer lined with wax paper, the juicy bundles arrive pumping hot and were free of any breakage. The skin is nicely thin yet thick enough to hold everything in. One small bite to let some steam escape, the savory dumplings are then perfect for slurping up all the soup and enjoying the succulent pork filling with an aromatic ginger nuance. \n\nNot nearly as mouth-watering as the XLB, the Crab and Pork Dumplings (8 pieces - $9.50) were juicy but with a slight fishy taste from the crab: http://bit.ly/REdEa9. I would skip this.\n\nThe Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($8) were crisp and moistly tender but the savory sweet sauce was runny and not oooey gooey, finger-licking like San Tung's: http://bit.ly/13gjwJ7. It will satisfy your chicken wing craving though.\n\nA Hakka favorite, the Braised Pork Belly w/ Preserved Veggies ($8.50) is my ultimate Chinese comfort food especially with steamed rice: http://bit.ly/VCt0Ku. The savory pork belly was super tender with a good meat to fat ratio. The preserved veggies helps balance the richness from the pork belly making it a more \"guilt-free\" dish.\n\nThe dinner foul of the night?\n\nHe tried to jab and pick up the XLBs with a metal spoon!!!\n\n*Tsk Tsk*\n\nIf only I had my feather duster with me...\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n*Cheap eats and generous portions. Most dishes are $6-$7 and nothing is over $11.\n*Very little MSG used. Besides being a tad thirsty after dinner, I didn't have an MSG allergic reaction (dry mouth, headache, and heart palpitations) as I normally do with Chinese food.\n*Service is typical of any Asian restaurant; fast and indifferent.

It was a little awkward, but I guess it wasn't too bad if you don't mind sharing a table with strangers.\n\nWe ordered the pork dumplings, pan fried dumplings, and seafood chow mein.

Yes, XLB is the shit, but it's pretty hard to do it right, so there can't be so many places that have high ratings.\n\nAnyhow, I digress. I wanted to try out one of the dumpling trifecta on Taraval, but not for the dumplings, hur hur. I can make my own just fine, thank you very much. Granted, I cannot make XLB, but technically it is a bun and not a dumpling. So I came to Dumpling Kitchen looking for some good Shanghainese food that is not XLB. Just to see if it's just hype or actually good food.\n\nAaaaand I was right -- it's all hype. Dumpling Kitchen cannot make good Shanghainese food at all. I got sheng jian bao (basically XLB with thicker skin and made potsticker style), twice cooked pork with leeks, and Shanghai stir fried noodle. All very classic dishes and really hard to mess up if you know how to cook it properly. So the fact that they all sucked = Dumpling Kitchen is not authentic.\n\nSheng jian bao -- the skin wasn't as crispy as it should be, probably because it was too doughy, and there was no juice inside. The filling was okay, lots of ginger, slightly sweet, and not too heavy.\n\nTwice cooked pork with leeks -- I think it should actually be called lots of leeks and a couple of pieces of pork, because that's what I got. The pork was thinly sliced (which isn't a crime on its own), but came in long strips instead of bite sized pieces (yellow flag here), was few and far in between (approaching a red flag), and seasoned the wrong way. And did I mention the leek to pork ratio was too out of whack? Yeah, well it was.\n\nShanghai stir fried noodle -- really, this was just egregious. The noodles were not springy; too doughy IMO. Not enough veggies, not enough meat. Really shouldn't be charging $8 or whatever for this.\n\ntl;dr: come here if you really like XLB but otherwise do not expect this to be authentic Shanghainese food at all.", "author": "Sherry L."}

Sticking to the basics, I ended up getting an order of:\n\n* Xiao Long Bao [ http://bit.ly/UMHu8W ] - Quality-wise, these are far better than Kingdom of Dumpling: stronger, springier, and thinner skin, with plenty of juice/soup inside, compared to the thicker skins found at Kingdom. Pretty good flavor-wise as well, but far sweeter than I'd like: I attribute it to heavy-handed usage of MSG, rather than sugar, given the typical side effects of MSG that I felt afterwards.\n\n* Sheng Jian Bao (Shanghainese Pan-Fried Steamed Dumplings) [ http://bit.ly/WFHDh4 ] - I have a bit of a love/hate relationship with sheng jian bao, due to the nature of what they are: steamed buns, that are then pan-fried. That, of course, then means you're biting into a dumpling bun that's soaked up all the oil used to fry it, which leads to the characteristic soft/mushy texture of this dish. That said, they do this very well, with equally great flavor, but suffering from the same MSG sweetness as the XLB.\n\nAt $15 after tax and tip for the two orders of 10 each, you're getting pretty good value for your money. And while I'll probably come again, I suspect that future visits will always be a struggle between here and Kingdom, depending on my mood.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Much more spacious than Kingdom, you should have little trouble with accessibility here, be it getting inside, or being seated.

(Ironically, to drive here and find parking was another 45 minutes...) \n\nWe ordered:\n*2 orders xiao long bao\n*dry fried chicken wings\n*shanghai stir-fried noodles\n*pan fried pork buns\n\nWe got some salted peanuts as appetizers (free!) as we waited the 5 minutes before our food came. Yes, it was that fast. The noodles came first and man, it was so delicious. I literally had this same dish the day before in San Jose with my parents, and this one was bigger, less oily and tastier! The noodles are clearly made in-house. The XLBs came next and a friend had said this was equivalent to Din Tai Fung's, which are pretty strong and daring words. But he was right--these are probably 90% to DTF's!! I was in love. It was slightly less flavorful soup and they didn't give us any ginger but $7.50 for 10 dumplings with no crazy long wait MORE than makes up for it.\n\nAnother friend claimed the chicken wings were close to San Tung. Again, tall words. The sauce is darker and it tasted more like the sauce for king do spare ribs than San Tung. I still say San Tung wins here, but again, am I waiting 2 hours for chicken wings? Hell no. (Yes, that was one of the places we tried to go to before deciding to come here instead.)\n\nThe pan fried pork buns were also delicious. I've gotten really sick of them as of late, but I still enjoyed these. \n\nTotal bill? $42 before tip. Hell yes!\n\nThis place is a total hidden gem--little to no wait (Fri 8:45pm), quick service, delicious and at a great price point. I'm totally coming next time to eat just the XLB.", "author": "Kat Y."}

Dumpling Kitchen, when busy is a \"lively\" (loud) place when a good percentage of tables are occupied. While certainly unintended, it does reflect the bustle of the modern/young Shaghainese restaurant feel. It is a 'no frills' joint that delivers the goods.\n\nLove to read other reviews (ain't that why I'm signed into Yelp?), and especially the the one that stated they were disappointed, actually cheated because based on their definition they only identified 5 versions of dumplings. LOL. They do serve more than 5, and their menu is sufficiently diverse to satisfy most of the people most of the time, which is why their usually is a line to be seated! One of the very few dissatisfied diners displaying their disappointment by taking a dump on their dumplings in a review.

I took off 1 star because the XLBs didn't come with gingers. XLBs are always fun to eat. The trick is to pick it up with your chopsticks, place it gently in a spoon and then poke a hole in the dumpling to get all the juices  out.

I really appreciate the ability of the wrappers and cooks to use such a thin skin for the XLB, but still manage to keep all of the yummy juices in when the XLBs are ready to be served. Personally, I felt that the XLBs were fattier than other places I have visited in San Francisco, but I think I enjoy the richer taste.\n\nI also ordered the Pea Sprouts cooked with garlic here, and it was flavorful. The portions that the restaurant serves was huge for the pea sprouts, so be prepared to potentially take some of it home! \n\nParking in the area can be difficult since its off Taraval, but you can usually find free parking after a few rounds in the neighborhoods; just be prepared to give yourself extra time for the parking.", "author": "Jeff M."}

Shanghai noodles were really fabulous. (If you're hoping to get San Tung-level chicken wings, go get in line at San Tung.) Shrimp and napa cabbage looked excellent on someone else's table.

Instead of waiting for a table, we decided to make a to-go order. We ordered the green onion pancake, shrimp fried rice, green beans, and shanghai pork dumplings. To our surprise, it was ready within 10-15 minutes and it seemed like the wait for a table was going rather quickly despite the business! The waitress was very busy, but was always kind when I stopped her and asked her questions. \n\nEverything was very good, but the green onion pancake was just okay in my opinion. Maybe it was because we had taken the food to go. I thought the dumplings were very good, but not as good as the dumplings at Shanghai Dumpling King on Balboa. However, as I have said before, it also could have been due to the fact that we took it to-go so it wasn't as hot and fresh as it could have been. Overall, it was very yummy!

Tonight is my first time trying this restaurant, but the service was so disappointed. My friend and I were seated in a small table. We ordered 4 dishes. 2 dishes came with huge plates. The table was just not enough for 4 dishes. Then I asked one of the servers (the girl at the front desk) to see if we can have the bigger table next to us. There were a few empty tables at the time when we were asking, then the girl just said \"hold on\" then she went to the kitchen and seemed to ask other servers. (not sure why she can't decide immediately because not only one table available at that time). Anyways, while we were waiting, another sever took the 2 customers to the table next to us, which is totally fine because that server didn't know we requested to change to that table. Then we expected the front desk girl would come back and give us another bigger table or at least an appology. We kept waiting, but she never came back to us and no response at all. She just ignored us for the whole time even we had eye contact. In the end, she finally came to our table, but she just put down a check on our table without saying a word. Excuse me, we were still eating and haven't requested the check yet.... That was so impolite and mean. Although we have some left over, she didn't even ask if we need a to go box.

Good XLB are ones where the skin is a bit thinner. It's like a challenge to pick up the dumpling, NOT BREAK IT, and actually consume the soup/filling in one delicious fell swoop. This one...I tasted much more of the wrap. Fail.\n\nPan Fried Dumpling: Please note...it's actually a bao. Not a dumpling. There's very different wraps on these suckers. And...this one was kinda meh. It didn't really stand out as a bao, and again. Grease. \n\nWe ordered something else, but all I remember about it was onions. Lots of onions. It might have been the mongolian beef. I just know it claimed to be a meat dish, but was really an onions dish. Fail, you!!\n\nService was ok. What you typically expect at a Chinese-style restaurant. The decor inside...was kind of gross.

I'm not angry at the restaurant, this is not a revenge review.  I'll admit, I have a couple on here that are.  My girlfriend and I wanted to take my grandma, my uncle and aunt out to dinner.  I was able to get a reservation the day of, very convenient.  However, fortunate or not, we were seated with a direct line view into the kitchen.  \n\nThe food we ordered were decent, but about 80% through our dinner, I witnessed \"the incident.\"  A kitchen worker went to grab a tray of frozen dumplings from the freezer, but in trying to be quick, she dropped the entire tray of dumplings onto the floor.  There were about 30 dumplings in total.  A small number compared to how many they serve each day.  She quickly scooped up all the dumplings on the floor, placed them back on the tray and back into the freezer.  I wish I didn't see it, but I saw the entire \"incident.\"  \n\nLong story short,  I spoke with a young lady/manager, in her early 20s, that their worker put all the dirty dumplings back in the fridge.  She spoke with the chef and told us that they wash their dumplings prior to cooking them.  As an Chinese person myself,  we DON'T \"wash\" dumplings prior to cooking them.  You make them, and you simply steam/boil/pan fry them before you serve, NO WASHING.  I then asked her, \"They just put everything back in the freezer, how would they know which one to wash?\" She replied, \"Oh, they did?\"  She then ran off to the kitchen again and after a minute or so, I saw the initial \"dumpling dropper\" go to the freezer and take out the tray of dirty dumplings.  Therefore, situation solved and I wasn't going to tell on them or make a big deal out of it.  She also never followed up with me.\n\nHowever, from that point on, I got the stink eye from 3-4 kitchen chefs, and a bus lady started clearing our plates before we finished everything and dropped the check on our table.  She literally tried to wrestle my uncle's plate from him while he was still trying to finish his food.  \n\nI didn't want to alert the whole restaurant.  I didn't need them to comp anything.  I didn't need an apology.  I just wanted them not to serve dirty dumplings to other customers, that would have been the end of it.  It is not professional of them to put back dirty dumplings and it is even less professional to basically kick us out of the restaurant before we finished our meal.\n\nI'm not that angry, I wanted to give them a chance since they have 4 stars here on yelp, but I'm really disappointed with what they did and how they reacted to the information I gave them.\n\nI'm sure they'll still serve good food.

There are quite a few dumpling specialty restaurants around SF these days, but I think this place beats out all of them.\n\nThe other dishes are great, as well. Their green onion pancake is different from what you normally expect -- the pancake is like a thick fried piece of dough, instead of the usual flaky layered pancake. I personally like this style, but some may not.\n\nThe black bean sauce noodles were great as well.

Per a friend's recommendation, we came to Dumpling Kitchen, only to discover that it was recently ranked the #1 place to get xlb in San Francisco!\n\nSERVICE\nWe got there at 9:01pm and were nervous that they wouldn't serve us since they close at 9:30pm, but thankfully the xlb gods were on our side because the hostess kept the kitchen open just long enough for us to rapid fire our order. \n\nThe fact that she was willing to let us mere mortals sit down and eat to our hearts' content made me want to come back again and again. It's not everyday that Chinese restaurants go above and beyond, especially 30 minutes before closing. \n\nThe food arrived super fast. It was probably because the workers wanted us to eat quickly and leave but we didn't mind. Bring on the dumplings! \n\nATMOSPHERE\nA slightly larger hole in the wall with your standard bare bones chinese restaurant decor: plain white tablecloths with plain white dishes. It's ok though. We didn't come here for the decor ;)\n\nFOOD\nSince we had about 2 minutes to read through the entire menu and place our order, we didn't have much time to think. We ended up ordering:\n-Pork xlb\n-Crab and pork steamed dumplings\n-Dry fried green beans\n-Pork potstickers\n\nEverything was delicious but I would skip the potstickers and order another dumpling dish... Or more xlb. \n\nComing from an Asian suburb in SoCal and after having tried Ding Tai Feng in multiple countries, I have high standards for xlb. \n\nI will say that these xlb came pretty damn close to that of DTF. The meat was perfectly cooked and it wasn't as fatty as some other xlb. The dumpling skin was perfect-- not too thick but just the right amount to hold the soup. The soup flavor was spot on but I wish there was a bit more soup. \n\nThe CRAB AND PORK DUMPLINGS were surprisingly good as well. You could actually taste the difference btwn these and the normal xlb. Light, juicy, and savory down to the last bite. \n\nThe DRY FRIED GREEN BEANS were among the best I've had. They didn't taste like the traditional dish but I actually preferred these because they were significantly less greasy. The savory onions has added just the right amount of flavor to the beans. \n\nOur order came out to about $40 after tax and tip. Not bad considering we left with happy bellies full of dumpling goodness!\n\n It's really far from the rest of the city but I'd come back if I had a killer xlb craving. Also heard they do a pretty mean pan fried pork bun, green onion pancake, and chicken wings. Just another 3 reasons to come back and support this hole in the wall!", "author": "Krystie M."}

Here, the lines are much shorter, there's plenty of seating, and the menu is more extensive. Service is relatively fast and food is delicious.\n\nXiao long baos -- Good chunk of juicy, tender pork and flavorful soup inside. The skin has the perfect thickness (thinner than those at Kingdom of Dumpling) and still holds in the soup. They look deflated sometimes, but still, I've never torn my XLBs here. You get 10 dumplings for $6.50, which I think is a great deal. A must order every time!\n\nPan-fried pork buns -- Perfectly crisped on the bottom, but overall very very very oily, so you'd probably get tired of these quickly and can't eat as many as you could for the steamed version. There's more meat in these than in the steamed version, too. Once again, same price, you get 10 for $6.50.\n\nGreen onion pancake -- I'm not a big fan of theirs. It's very fluffy, airy, not dense at all. (I prefer mine to be thin and crispy). However, I like how it doesn't feel as oily as it does at other places.\n\nVegetarian goose -- I love it, but the bean curd texture is inconsistent at times. Sometimes it's soft (which I prefer) and other times it's hard/chewy. Overall, it's very fresh but needs to be garnished with more green onion. And they don't skimp with the mushroom filling either.\n\nShanghai-style stir-fried rice cakes -- Very greasy, but pretty good. I'm not a big fan of rice cake texture; it's thick, starchy, and very chewy that I probably burn more calories chewing than consuming.\n\nIn terms of cleanliness, meh... This is a Chinese restaurant. That's an excuse within itself. But it's much cleaner than some restaurants in SF Chinatown. On the weekends until ~1PM, expect a wait, but probably not as long as the wait at Dumpling Kitchen.

One of the most difficult things about eating them though is: 1, picking them up without breaking the skin, so the juice stays within each dumpling, and 2, eating them at the right time so that the temperature doesn't burn your mouth and the skin hasn't cooled down enough to become tougher.\n\nThere are several types of SLB/XLBs that Dumpling Kitchen makes, but the original (the first item on the menu I believe) is a classic and a great way to introduce someone that's never eaten them before. Each order has ten pieces in each basket, unless otherwise noted on the menu.\n\nThere are other foods that I've tried here, including broccoli beef and the potstickers. They were both very tasty and one could taste the \u944a\u6c23/wok hei (flavor brought by a chef's skill in controlling fire throughout cooking). Their west lake beef soup is also very flavorful.\n\nDumpling Kitchen makes as use of all their room, so it may be a bit tight to move around at times, which is understandable, as more and more people find out about this place. They do have a couple large tables that can seat parties of 8+, but is mostly accommodated to parties of two to four.\n\nParking is definitely not easy to find due to apartments that have double wide garages, soaking up valuable curbside space. There is a Muni rail line right out front as well, so double parking on the tracks can cause great entertainment for others watching cars possibly getting smashed.\n\nAlso, though the restaurant closes at 10 P.M., the kitchen closes at 9 P.M. Make sure you get in before then, otherwise you will be turned away.\n\nOther than that, Dumpling Kitchen is an excellent place to go stuff your face with yummy goodness.", "author": "Henry N."}

Unfortunately, I cannot give this place more than a 3 because... the soup dumplings were not soupy. The meat was soft and tender but there wasn't a lot of juice in the dumplings. When I eat soup dumplings, I expect the soup to be spilling out of the dumplings when I take a bite of it. No, I don't think it's high expectations because other restaurants were able to make that happen.Shanghai chow mein was also a downer. The noodles were too thick. Fine, I get it because it's supposed to be that way but the dish was lacking a lot of flavors, it was very blend. I had to add more soy sauce and chili to give it more flavors.

The thickness of the skin worked for these dumplings because they were fried, which made it nice and chewy. I prefer this over the XLB.\n\nShanghai stir fried rice cake - I loved the taste of the dish, but the rice cakes were either cooked just right or overcooked, which made them super sticky. \n\nChicken wings - The wings were probably my favorite thing out of what we ate.

I rarely come to this area, but have always been told to get Chinese food when I am. We got the pork and seafood soup dumplings, which were delicious! The way they're supposed to be (none of that gross, thick-skinned, stale stuff in Chinatown). The green onion pancakes were also really good, but not like the ones I'm used to (they were yellow and less flaky). We ordered the shanghainese rice cakes on recommendation from our waitress - could probably have skipped these. They weren't bad, just kind of bland. I wish we'd ordered the pork belly instead!

Just splash on a tad bit of vinegar plus soy sauce and indulge yourself in nirvana! (Not literally, but you get what I'm saying!)

I do recommend going to Dumpling Kitchen if the wait for Kingdom is too long and you're willing to sacrifice a margin of deliciousness in exchange for being seated in a reasonable amount of time.\n\nDeliciousness: Kingdom wins here with superior Xiao Long Bao flavor and their soy/vinegar dipping sauce. However, Kitchen's XLB had better structural integrity. Even the dumplings that were stuck together could be pulled apart without losing the all-important soup filing.\n\nCleanliness: Dumpling Kitchen by a small margin. Both health reports are pretty scary, but who cares? These are dumplings, filled with soup!\n\nWait time: Dumpling Kitchen wins by seating in 10 min vs wait times of 30 min or more at Kingdom. Kitchen's dining capacity is maybe twice that of Kingdom.\n\nService: Kitchen edges out Kingdom here ever so slightly. Hot tea was delivered immediately, and I got a water refill without asking. Kitchen also doesn't hustle you about only being able to place one order like Kingdom does.\n\nValue: Like Kingdom, Kitchen's prices are incredibly reasonable. Kitchen's XLB cost less than Kingdom, but other dumpling orders cost more.", "author": "Kris H."}

Wontons in Chili Oil (2 orders)\n13. Shanghai-Style Green Onion Pancake\nPea Sprouts w/garlic\n\nWow, that was a lot of food.  Our friend's favorite (who lives around the corner) is the #12.  They are very tasty, as are the #1.  I thought the #1 here were a LOT better than those at Kingdom of Dumpling because the soup is so much more flavorful.  Of course, it could also be that a lot of the soup at KoD leaked out because the skins were so thin, but had a thick knot of dough at the top.  The #1 here are just right because the skins don't break when you try to pick them up and there's not a huge knot of dough at the top.\n\nI've heard the #13 here is a different preparation than at other places, but I can't attest to that because I've only had it here.  Maybe it's the Shanghai-Style which is different.  Whatever it is, I like how they do it here!\n\nThe Pea Sprouts were very good, also.  They are similar to Chinese broccoli, but not.  A slightly bitter taste, cooked and served with whole garlic cloves.

So, Dumpling Kitchen is less of a hole in the wall that Kingdom of Dumpling and actually has tables that seat more than 4 people. This is a place that multi-generational Chinese families like to frequent, so they have a plethora of large, round tables. In fact, my party of only 3 was seated at a table that could have comfortably accommodated 6. We had to wait a bit around 7pm on the Sunday evening when we arrived, but tables soon cleared up. \n\nWe ordered XLB (about $7 for 10), Shanghai egg rolls (sadly vegetarian), clay pot rice with smoked ham, Shanghai stir fried noodles, and pea shoots. The XLB were pretty amazing! Each of them had a wrapper that was thin, but not TOO thin that they would break upon touch. And they each carried a lot of tasty soup! My only quibble with the XLB is that the quality of the pork used seemed not very good because there were a lot of chewy bits that didn't taste so good in the filling. \n\nThe Shanghai stir fried noodles and egg rolls were not very authentic seeming as they used shredded cabbage and carrot and green onions in addition to the shredded pork and lacked the pea shoots and napa cabbage. Traditional stir fried noodles have pea shoots, napa cabbage, and shredded pork. At least they used the right chewy noodles and sweet soy sauce to flavor it. This seemed more like just regular chow mien. And the egg rolls had similar fillings of cabbage and carrot rather than a nice mixture of seasoned and stir fried napa cabbage, shitake mushroom, and seasoned pork. They were still tasty, but not what I wanted. And they were EXTREMELY greasy too. Shanghainese style egg rolls aren't supposed to be vegetarian!\n\nThe clay pot rice was really tasty and it features large slices of smoked pork on top of the whole thing. My sister let the rice sit at the edge of the clay pot for a good long while so it got really crispy. It seemed really light, but the leftovers were perfect as the saltiness of the pork really blended into the rice. The pea shoots were perfect too, and I especially liked how they didn't put in minced garlic and went with sauteed whole cloves of garlic instead.

Not very oily either, which is always a plus.\n*Dry Fried Chicken Wings ($7.5)--We were curious & wanted a little extra dish to nibble on.  They gave a lot of wings & were meaty, but we could have done without them.  Sauce was slightly sweet but made it very slippery to eat and was nothing special.  Definitely doesn't have anything on SO or San Tung's wings.\n*Crispy Egg Puffs ($3)---Been wanting to try these at Kingdom of Dumpling, but they never had them whenever I went.  These are like three light fluffy sugar dusted donuts without all the filling!  Soo good!  \n\nDumpling Kitchen is a lot bigger, cleaner, and better staffed (they're very attentive too) than Kingdom of Dumpling.  DK also offers more menu items.

We got both kinds and eh, it's a good filler to have on the side but nothing to brag about.  We also got the sticky rice rolls which had a fried roll on the inside and was stuffed with shredded pork.

We didn't try any other dumplings, since that was supposed to be the highlight. \n\nThe verdict: While the texture and soupiness of the dumplings were great, the flavor wasn't up to my expectations. Perhaps I'm more used to the Cantonese flavor of Shanghai dumplings, but these had a stronger ginger flavor and something else that I wasn't sure of. It's probably just a different recipe for the pork filling versus Din Tai Fung etc. The dumplings also looked a bit wilted, but rest-assured they were all filled with plenty of soup. The skin was also quite thin, and none of them broke on the bottom. It wasn't piping hot, so I didn't burn my tongue on any of the soup. Success! If the dumplings had less ginger in them, this would be four stars for sure. \n\nOther dishes we ordered were the bok choy in house broth, which was actually my favorite dish. The broth was a bit salty on its own, but it gave great flavor to the vegetables and any rice should you choose to order some. It also came with some mushrooms and carrots sprinkled on top, which was a nice addition. Finally, we ordered the bean curd salad, which was actually served in chili oil. I actually prefer the Taiwanese style where it's just salted and maybe served in a bit of clear broth. However, it was still quite good. \n\nI also noticed that the service was especially fast!! We had just barely ordered and come back from the restroom and the vegetables and bean curd salad already arrived. The dumplings understandably took a bit longer, since they had to steam. It was also convenient that they accept credit cards. \n\nNext time, I'd like to try the Shanghai pan-fried pork buns, which I hear are delish!", "author": "Audrey L."}

Everything was piping hot and the beer was nice and cold. The green onion pancake was definitely much different than other places in the city. Much lighter more crisp, less oily, almost like an indian fry bread of sorts. We actually didnt finish this order between 2 people, we could of but didnt and I feel that was a smart move.

I wanted to know what the hype was all about. The thing that made me REALLY wanna go was those pictures of the xiao long baos. They looked really good in the picture. Like the skin wasn't too thick and it wasn't oily. Couldn't tell from the pictures on the inside though... Like the meat quality or soup quality. Anyway... We ordered one round of xiao long baos, one spinach with garlic, one dry fried chicken wings, and one clay pot rice. \n\nUnfortunately the xiao long baos did not look like what was shown on the yelp pictures (grrrr..) a and they did not taste as good as I had hyped it up to be. They were oily and skin was okay thickness. Not as thin as I hoped it would be. Remember you gotta eat it warm! There was one left at the end of our meal and it was cold. I think the soup congealed cuz it was solid and oily. Pretty gross. Warm = okay. Cold = disgusting!\n\nAs for the other entrees. Spinach with garlic is good but hard to mess up. I eat it all the time in my own home. I surprisingly liked the dry fried chicken wings! They were really juicy..not crunchy if you're into that sort of thing. I like it when there's a lot of meat but not too much breadding or fried stuff..hehehe so this was my favorite part of the meal.\n\nThe clay pot rice was okay though I would prefer eating plain white rice with my food instead. I did like the ham pieces in the rice... But maybe as a side thing not part of the clay pot.\n\nI would come back here occasionally but it sucks that there's a huge line nearly every time I've passed by.

I know there's many similar restauarants on the same street as well, but let me just talk about this one. Plenty of seating, but it does get crowded during lunch and dinner hours, so I suggest you plan accordingly!\n\nThe Xiao Long bao (Chinese dumplings) are really really good. 10 comes in an order but to be honest, I can probably eat all 10, or even 20 of these bite sized dumplings. Their lunch specials are pretty cheap on the weekdays but they do get pricier on the weekends, but the portions are HUGE. I saw multiple men sitting next to me, and they couldn't even finish the lunch special. Talk about quantity! Anyways, their Chinese Ham with bok Choy in Clay pot is very popular.

Probably the best Chinese restaurant I've been to in the Bay area, and definitely comparable to the best in LA.

Everything was delicious, with the soy milk being my least favorite (just needed to be hotter) and the green onion pancake and red oil wontons being my absolute favorite. The pancake was quite possibly the best I've ever had in my life. It looked like it'd be too thick and dense but it was completely the opposite.

We got the XLB, Shanghai pan fried pork buns, pork dumplings in chili oil, dry fried chicken wings, and a few other things that were less noteworthy.\n\nSome notes:\n- the XLB photos on yelp look quite tasty. The XLB we received did not look like them - they were less skillfully wrapped, if looks are to be believed. 1-2 of them popped before we even touched them, which was sad. They were also fairly low on soup content.\n- the Shanghai pan fried pork buns were not like the other Shanghai pan fried pork buns I've had - say, in Shanghai (or even at other Chinese places in the bay area). There was no soup in them. If you're okay with that, the rest of it is fine, but I guess I had my hopes up.\n- pork dumplings in chili oil - nothing to write home about.

It brought my back to the time I studied abroad in china. That being said, it was alright, but not as super delicious as some of the places that sold it when I was in Shanghai.\n\nAlso got some shengjianbao which weren't quite as juicy as delicious as in Shanghai, but still decent. I've noticed that all the ones I've gotten in the US were dry and not super soupy (like xiaolongbao) like the ones I've had in Shanghai. No complaints here as they were still as tasty, but didn't give you the hot explosion in your mouth, which, while delectable, usually scalded at least one spot in your mouth.\n\nThey actually serve a variety of dishes here, not just dumplings and those chinese pancakes like some restaurants with \"dumpling\" in their name. The food was decent overall. The service a little slow (you have to manually tell them to give you more water... though they did ask if we were ready to order like 3 times in quick succession[Actually, not sure if this is nice or rude haha]), but like I've said before, I don't really expect super service when going to a chinese place.

Not too sweet, saltiness is perfect, they aren't broken, they're juicy, one of the less expensive places, and can't think of more reasons why they're perfect but they pretty much are. Not sure where the ginger for the vinegar is but I'm not complaining since I don't use ginger with it anyways. \n\nOnly Din Tai Fung can rival these and since DTF is all the way in SoCal, I can't really say which I prefer because that would just depend on where in California I am! \n\nParking is okay... It's not terrible. There were times we circled around for 10+ minutes and park 2-3 blocks away, other times I find parking within 2 blocks. I almost always have to wait for a table and have shared a bigger table with other people as well. But you also have to wait at Kingdom of Dumpling (up the block) and Shanghai Dumpling King too (not that I would go to these two over Dumpling Kitchen). \n\nAll the dishes were pretty big, we had 4 people and ordered 2 orders of XLB, 2 noodle dishes, and pan fried pork buns with barely anything leftover... If it's just me and husband, we usually order 2 orders of XLB and call that dinner. \n\nShanghai style chow mein - very yummy, that has good amount of veggies but not too much where you're left wondering whether you ordered noodles with veggies or veggies with noodle. \n\nPreserved veggies rice cakes - thought it looked bland bc it's white but it is not! The preserved veggies are pretty salty so you eat it with the rice cakes. I can't decide which noodle dish I like better because they both taste very different. \n\nXiao long bao - this should be the reason why you're here. ORDER IT!!!! \n\nPan fried pork buns - it's like a XLB (the inside tastes the same minus the juicy soup) but with a thicker, bread-ier skin... My parents like it more than XLB, but husband doesn't like it. I like this crispy bottom of these but it's kinda-not-really the same as XLB.

That pocket of juice that builds up in the wee crevices of the dough ... and when it pops its well worth without. \n\nTheir sweet buns is a first for me because they gave this almost tapioca/honey flavored dip that really made this dish more of a dessert one but well worth digging into, nevertheless. \n\nAnother first is eating their half a pizza pie-like portion of green onion pancake.

Half of it should be). We also ordered Sichuan style spicy noodles, also known as dan dan noodles.  That comes as a totally shit. It is not like it should be at all, cheap instant-noodles-like noodles In a poop color sauce, horrible dish , worst ever noodles you ever had. There is also veggie dish with pak choi and mushroom, has no taste, except salty.  I understand shanghainese style veggie is very plain , my mom is shanghainese but at least add some oyster sauce or something else. Never had this before. Then critique comes to kung pao chicken.  It should be chicken cubes, not slices. Also the taste is much light. The dish should be red color due to the sweet and spicy sauce, with chicken and cucumber and carrot ( not sure) cubes and lots of peanuts ( important ). Well the only thing cooked right is the beef with leek and onion. So I think giving a one star is very generous. Again, if you go there , order steam bun.  That's all.

In my book, the XLB here is okay, but the bar should be set a lot higher in San Fran since there's such a huge chinese population here.  Most of the other items that we ordered were also mediocre.  This includes the mu shu chicken, the honey walnut shrimp, and their pig's stomach mustard cabbage soup.  We also ordered a seafood fried mochi, and it turned out to be quite a disappointment.  It was slightly undercooked and very bland.  One thing we did enjoy was their home made soymilk.  Delicious and refreshing!!  All in all, Dumpling Kitchen does not stand up to its name, but is acceptable to dine at.  Just don't go out of your way to come all the way here in hopes of tasting some substantially good Xiao Long Bao.", "author": "Steven L."}

For a place that gets a 4 star rating...I expected better. We were here at around 4PM. There were only about 3 other small groups there at the time. Why do Chinese people always seem to have a problem with making eye contact? My boyfriend and I walked in and no one in there pays attention to the door for customers. Got seated and was ready to order. We literally had to stare someone down to get their attention to take our order. We had to ask 3 times to get our water. First time I actually said it with our order. The guy acknowledged that he heard each order. As our food came out, still no water. My boyfriend asked again as the guy was cleaning some tables. He said water? Ok. So this time he really said water so we thought ok, maybe he didn't hear the first time. But as he finished cleaning his tables he walked around like we didn't just ask for some water. I was getting annoyed at this point so I asked again and GET THIS. He acted like it was the FIRST time he heard it!! When we started eating everything was fine and THEN we found HAIR in our food. Then we had to try and flag someone down again as they do their work with their heads down. The pan fried buns were awesome (noodles were..ehh..nothing special. Fried rice, no comment there. Couldn't even stomach that after the surprise) and they canceled the order with the hair but man...it was like trying to get the attention of a girl who's not into you. They just don't care. Probably wouldn't come here again. Nothing special.", "author": "Jennie L."}

The Spicy Pork Dumplings were outstanding - came out with a very generously garnished plate of dumplings with rough cut Garlic - nearly cubes of garlic - think Stinking Rose version of Dumplings - and if you like garlic, these were awesome - really, really tasty and just enough spice to make it onto the back of the tastebuds while not making chug glasses of water.\n\nBig surprise were the great Salt & Pepper Chicken wings - great coating- have been doing a more \"purist\" route to my chicken wings and salt and pepper, when done right, is as orthodoxy as you get...just the choice of a plump chicken wing, lightly coated, fried (and baked sometimes) to perfection...\n\nSweet Vinegar Pork Ribs were just a plate of diced pork ribs in a pretty think, hoisin/vinegar sauce - good, not great - I'd say that this might be better served with rice or something to cut the sauce with - ribs were good and don't get me wrong - me love ribs!!! - but it was just a bit thick on the sauce to keep eating - a few bites were all you needed, maybe not a whole plateful.\n\nI am not usually a big \"noodle\" fan, but these \"rice cakes\" were pretty damn good - think chown fun but with a much thicker \"noodle\" (the rice cake) - I'd prefer a mix of mustard in the sauce, but that is just personal preference (and they don't have mustard, which threw me off a bit).\n\nLong lines, worth the drive and wait - also they do take out!", "author": "Richard D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-04", "description": "Booyashaka. Dumpling Kitchen is coming off a strong performance in my tummy. \n\nI'd been craving some chinese food for a week, and after a trip to nearby Stonestown, I was on the Yelp lookout for some nearby chinese food. I found Dumpling Kitchen and decided to give it a try. \n\nWe walk in and the first thing we notice is how loud it is. Whoa. But it was actually primarily due to a loud table of college kids. Durn kids. But every table in the place was occupied, which I took as a good sign. We sit down and with a quick look over the menu, we spot the things we typically like. It's Shanghai food, so you have your xiao long bao, green onion pancakes, stir-fried rice cakes, pan-fried dumplings (sheng jian bao), etc. Although other things on the menu looked very enticing, I stuck to my standards. \n\n1) xiao long bao: I have to say that these rival any other in the city. Better than Shanghai Dumpling King on Balboa, better than Kingdom of Dumpling up the street on Taraval, better than San Dong on Geary. The skin was soft and delicate, relatively thin, and didn't tear when they were picked up. The filling was very flavorful, extremely juicy (actually living up to the soup dumpling name), and piping hot. Really couldn't find much wrong with these. \n\n2) Pan-fried bao: I kind of prefer the pan-fried bao to be larger, but these were quite good. The outer dough was crispy on the bottom, and the steamed part was light enough, although it was right at that border of being too dense. Again, the pork filling was excellent, juicy, and hot. I always forget how big a difference the temperature of a dish when it is served makes. Unlike revenge, this is not a dish best served cold. \n\n3) Shanghai style chow mein: They were good. The noodles were possibly made in house? Not sure. They were large and in charge, thick and chewy. Overall, there wasn't anything particularly special about the chow mein. Though it was good and satisfied my noodle fix. \n\n4) Five spice tofu and pork: Although I normally looooove any dish that mixes thin pork strips and baked tofu, this one was a bit of a disappointment. The flavor was ok, although it had a hint of some type of flavor (I'd like to guess yellow chives, but I'm not sure) that set it apart from other places. I guess it just kind of seemed like something I make at home. It also contained big strips of onions, green and red bell peppers. Good with some rice, but I'll probably try something else next time. \n\nSo there you go. I was impressed. I would definitely go again. The portions are quite large, and the prices are very reasonable. Service was pretty quick and friendly. Oh yeah, and they give you a small dish of salted peanuts when you sit down. Awesome. Unless you have a peanut allergy. Then it's not awesome, and it's more like anaphylactic shock.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Perhaps I am now a snooty XLB eater but I like my XLB steaming hot, thin skinned and on the dainty side. When the skin is too thick and tough and the dumpling itself is too big, I feel like it starts to taste too chewy and the filly is always really hard. \n\nAs for other dishes (you already know Mr. W. and I wouldn't just order one dish now... right..?) we had: \n\nthe free salted peanuts-- sooo delicious \n\nShanghai style chow mein-- a delicious dish of grease and chow mien \n\ndry fried chicken-- a little too spicy for my taste but Mr. Dubs love it \n\nEverything we had was decent but nothing (besides the free peanuts) really made me want to tell everyone to check this place out. I was also a little turned off by the slooooow service. Against my will, Mr. W. opted for a second can of soda and it took us 15 minutes to catch our waitress' attention. We were one of the 3 tables that night and she was too preoccupied with the conversation she was having with another waitress. \n\nI wouldn't say this is my best experience with shanghainese food but I can hardly consider it my worst.

My boyfriend and I were seated quickly when we showed up at 5:30 on a Friday night. They quickly served us tea and a small bowl of spiced peanuts.\n We noted with delight that the restaurant charges for take home containers and requests that customers bring their own!! That's where the extra half star comes from.\nWe were also impressed by the low prices. This restaurant was extremely reasonable for the quality.\nWe ordered some XLB, the garlic eggplant, and pork dumplings in chili oil. The eggplant came first. It was super delicious. The sauce was spicy and sweet with lots of flavor. The eggplant was cooked perfectly. The portion was HUGE and I ate the rest of it for two different entire lunches after my boyfriend and I had done our best to finish it in the restaurant.\nThe XLB came next, piping hot. The dumplings had lots of flavor and a decent amount of soup. The meat was tender and fresh, clearly a popular enough item to have been made that day and not frozen. Not one single one of the skins broke. This place is one of my new favorite places to find XLB for the quality and price.\nThe pork dumplings in chili oil was a comparatively weak point. This dish was a typical set of 12 steamed pork dumplings with a simple sauce.  I would order their regular steamed dumplings like this again, but only after trying some other items like the shanghai buns. For that particular style of dumplings, I'd prefer to go to China Dumpling North on Noriega where it is their specialty. Dumpling Kitchen did these well, but it was clearly not their specialty. \nWhen we went, the restaurant wasn't particularly busy, so I can't speak to a normal hour, but the service was attentive and responsive to even eye contact. \nI'm looking forward to going back and trying the Shanghai pork buns!", "author": "Allxie C."}

I've never been a huge fan, but these were good. Just be careful when handling them because they are quite fragile. One strong stroke of a utensil to pick it up can easily break the dumpling skin and then you'd lose the treasured soup in it. The filling was very tender and flavorful. I also noticed the filling was just as tender in the vegetable and pork dumpling as well.  \n\nWe had three noodle dishes and the Shanghai chow mein and the Shanghai rice cakes were essentially the same thing, except a different noodle was used. I liked the rice cakes more, since it's not everyday I can each rice cakes with a chewy and dense texture. \n\nThe portions are not huge here, which led our group of seven to order around 10 items to satisfy the hunger of two growing boys.

After we wrote our name down our wait only ended up to be about 10 minutes which isn't too bad since there were about four groups ahead of us. \nThe servers here are quick on their feet because as you sit down they already place your menu, plates, utensils, and tea right in front of you, which I thought was clever because at other certain places they take awhile to give you your tea and rush you as are looking at the menu debating what to get as they keep passing by wondering if you're ready.

I felt like the texture of the meat inside was like moist breadcrumbs and the flavor was really off. It had a strong five spice taste to it. I have no idea how this place got such good ratings for their XLB, it wasn't good.. in fact, this is probably the worst XLB I have ever had. Most of the XLB had holes on the bottom before it hit our table and so I received no soup for the 2 out of 4 of the ones I ate. Worse luck ever.\n\nPork dumplings in chili oil (10pcs) () *Spicy $6.00: Ok, this dish was even WORSE than the XLB I ordered. Dish wasn't even spicy at all! In fact, it was sweet. Who makes dumplings with SWEET NON-SPICY CHILI OIL. (\"*spicy\" pfft!). The texture of the meat was also not good. Usually when you eat dumplings, it is one chunk wrapped with dough. For this place, the meat inside the dumpling crumbled. CRUMBLED... I have never seen dumplings do that..... smh\n\nGreen Onion Pancake: This wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. I like that the onions were there but not too strong for you to leave with an onion breath. Soft yet crispy. \n\nShanghai Style Chow Mein: I love thick noodles! This wasn't bad, a bit on the bland side, but overall you get a lot of meat and veggies along with the chow mein. \n\nShredded Pork with Veggies: The lady recommended this to us. Not a fan due to the fact that it had no flavor.... not even a saltiness flavor... just bland.\n\nA place well known for their XLB and the day I came it sucked. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. The prices here are reasonable, but I can find better places with similar prices for my XLB cravings.

I had the dry-fillet fish, lion's head meatballs, sweet and sour chicken, potstickers, and egg puffs.  The fish and chicken were nicely battered with tasty sauces.  They were good, but you could get the same thing at many restaurants.  The potstickers were nice because there was a good, crispy sear on them...however they were very small, therefore not exceptional.  My friend did not like the meatballs because they were very rare (pink) and soft (filler)...however I did like them.  The egg puffs were our big disappointment.  I have had them here before, and they usually arrive piping hot and fresh.  This time it was obvious that they were giving us left-over puffs (from the lunch crowd) that had been re-heated.  They were not fresh and hot, and someone had previously cut them in half (I don't even think the server noticed that they had been cut).\n\nThe service is somewhere between minimal and disappointing.  The workers are not friendly or engaging -- clearly their job is just to get the food on the table as fast as possible.  One waitress, and older lady, is exceptionally rude.  One time I placed my order and she responded, \"Is that all you are getting?  You need to order more!\"  This time, when I ordered the puffs, she said, \"Oh no, that takes 20 minutes to make.  Are you sure you want that?\"  My friend and I spent about an hour eating and had just finished our puffs when the staff cleared our table...taking our tea cups and tea, so that we could not linger and visit any longer.  They were clearly trying to get us to leave so that they could seat someone else.\n\nThe atmosphere is neighborhood \"hole-in-the-wall\" without any charm.  It is crowded, poorly ventilated, and all the surfaces look worn and greasy.  \n\nI used to love this place, but unfortunately it's popularity has caused the owner and waitstaff to take their customers for granted.

The place was pretty packed and the food on everyone's table looked delicious. The menu is very extensive so it was pretty hard to choose what to order because we wanted to try everything. As far as I can remember, we ordered the following:\n\n-2 orders of XLBs -- soupy and very delicious!\n-Pan-fried Potstickers -- good!\n-Steamed pork and cabbage dumplings -- I was a bit bummed when the dumplings came out looking identical as the potstickers, but nonetheless it was good\n-Wontons in chili oil -- not really spicy\n-Spicy cow stomach -- tasteless and not spicy at all (not recommended)\n-Sizzling Rice Soup w/ chicken -- bland and not recommended\n-Beijing-style noodle in black bean sauce -- the noodles didnt really go well with this dish and there wasnt enough sauce.\n-Dry-braised string beans -- lacking something I couldnt quite make out.. but still good.\n-Spinach w/ garlic - yummy\n-Walnut Prawns - VERY GOOD!\n\nI wanted to try their Shanghai noodles but they messed up on our order and it never came. The service here was efficient but you can tell that they were a bit scattered and chaotic because of how busy they were. Plates were coming to our table when we didnt order them though we would have gladly taken them if it hadnt gone to their correct tables :) \n\nWe received 10% off on our bill so the total was about $75.00. A bit improving is needed but I'm optimistic that this establishment will remain in good business for years to come.", "author": "M W."}

People see the line,they get influenced, (line=must be good!) and they Yelp it's goodness. Then people read it on Yelp and create more of a line. Equals more stars. Self fulfilling prophecy. Never mind that it's just okay. (Too expensive for what you get. The dumplings are good but Shandong Deluxes down the street are better and cheaper.) And what's up with the soggy deep fried fish? Everybody, (even Panda Express) knows how to deep fry something and still keep it crispy even with sauce on top. (It's called baking soda, yo!) The Shanghainese rice cakes and noodles were bland, and the onion pancake tasted like cardboard.

Dumpling Kitchen wins for the size because there are plenty of tables here and also tables for groups of 4 or more (1star).\n\n I looked over the menu and though Kingdom of Dumpling has more variety of dumplings, Dumpling Kitchen serves something that Kingdom does not, pan fried pork buns (~$5 for 8 pieces)! I first tried it in San Jose and have been dying to find something like it in SF and luckily Kitchen has it! It is a cross between pork bun and XLB. The one I had in SJ was soupy and I was disappointed that it was less soupy here, but nonetheless still good! It's topped with sesame seeds and green onions and you lose yourself for a second just smelling it as it is served on your table. \n\nWe also ordered the crab and pork dumpling ($9 for 8 pieces) which we could have done without. I didn't taste much crab but I will disagree with other yelpers who said the skin was mushy and broke easily. \n\nThe green onion pancake was delicious! It was different from Kingdom of Dumpling and the portion is HUGE for $3.60. It was served on a dinner entree plate. The pancake was fried to golden brown perfection . Another plus, you can actually taste the green onion. \n\nLastly, we tried the beef stew egg noodle soup. This was by far one of the best I've ever had. I'm all about the soup and their soup was ON POINT. So much beefy flavor goodness I couldn't get enough of it. The noodles were also good and fresh.

I was imagining something more crispy outside and flaky and fluffy inside. Their rendition was hard inside out and dipping the fried dough into soy milk didn't really help. \n- Soy milk was great, on the other hand! Soy milk you order at Chinese restaurants isn't anything like \"Silk\"; it's not sweet at all and sometimes, if you are unlucky, you might get weirdly seasoned soy milk -- either too salty or too tofu-y. Dumpling Kitchen's had the perfect seasoning! Note: It comes out hot. \n- The main event xiaolongbao wasn't the best I've ever had, but was definitely better than what you'd get at a typical dim sum place. I thought dumplings could have had more soup, but otherwise, they were great. The dumpling skin was soft and chewy and the seasoning was good. A complaint: They didn't give us ginger to go with the vinegar dipping sauce! (The crunchiness of ginger adds so much to the dish!)\n- Wontons in chili oil were good.

I've been here almost a dozen times with an average wait time of 3 minutes. It's also right off the L line, so getting to this location isn't such an excursion. \n\nThe dumplings themselves are superb. I've had dumplings from all over the world. We'll, just China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong, but the dumplings here are pretty comparable to the dumplings I've had overseas, including the flagship location of Ding Tai Feng (which is extremely overrated). The skin on each individual dumpling is thin, but extremely chewy. The stuffing they use tastes fresh and savory. The soup is PIPING hot right off the basket. Freshness is the key word here and this place gets it right every single time. \n\nThe other items on the menu are pretty standard. I usually get the fried string beans (), braised pork with sour vegetables, the stir fried rice cakes, and fried sugar pea vegetables. Those dishes are good and intended to accentuate the flavor of the soup dumplings themselves. Personally, as long as these side dishes don't differ too much than what you're accustomed to, then it's okay and doesn't affect my 5 star rating even if they're not crazy amazing. \n\nPerhaps the biggest reason why I gave this place a 5 star rating instead of a 4 (which is already really good), is because the waiters don't pressure me into buying their overhyped, overrated egg puffs. I laud them for that. It's annoying when Chinese restaurants try to push Americanized dishes towards their non-Asian or Americanized looking Chinese patrons.", "author": "Vince C."}

We both received our own ginger  vinegar plates. The wrap was thin and soup was piping hot inside! \n 4 stars\n\n#6. Beijing Style boiled pork and chive dumplings\n - Like the Xiao Long Bao, they were exceptionally good. Nice and hot  with good flavor.\n 4 stars\n\n#12 Wonton in Chile oil\n - Not really a fan. I could taste the flour from the wrap. It wasn't spicy at  all but a little sweet. I even tasted some peanut sauce in it.\n 2 stars\n\n#15 Beijing style sweet buns\n -  Fried Man Tao with condensed milk. What else can I say? Fried foods  are always good.\n 3 stars \n\n#26 Sizzling Rice Soup\n - This was the worst sizzling rice soup I tasted.  It was EXTREMELY bland.

It was raining and cold   last nite so I was kinda upset the soup wasn't better on a cold day. \n1.5 stars \n\n#68 Dry fried chicken wings\n - They tried very hard to imitate the best dry fried chicken wings on  planet earth and failed. They are getting there. Sauce is decent but  wings were not really dry fried. Overall , eeehhhhh.......\n2 stars\n\nNot on the menu but posted on the wall we ordered sweet and salty soy milk with Chinese donuts. The sweet is something you can buy in a gallon bottle from Golden Gate soy Milk Company. The salty soy milk was quite delicious. They added some sliced Chinese donuts and chili oil. Not bad at all... I do recommend the salty soy milk\n\nWith the amount of food I ordered, the bill was $44.60 which is not bad at all considering I had lunch and dinner for the next day. The staff was very catering and attentive, aside from the fact one of the waitress forgot who a teapot belongs to and asked every table. Overall the dumplings were decent but the other dishes can use some TLC (or at least the stuff I ordered). \n\nI will definitely come back to try some other dishes such as the braised lions head meatballs and Braised Pork Trotter. I'll give this dining experience 3 star this time, but things may change. I will continue my quest for FABULOUS DUMPLINGS IN THE BAY!!!!!!!", "author": "Scott L."}

I love how the soup is so flavorful once you take a bite and of course drink it from the spoon, Chinese style! As for the pan fried pork bao, it was also good because they didn't cover it with too much bao layers. So I did not feel as bloated, also that crisp on the bottom along with the soup inside just makes it solid. As for the noodle soup, it was not bad. However it was hard to finish the noodle soup since they give so much noodles! You would either need a big party, huge appetite, or just stuff yourself to death. lol\n\nAs for service, the waitresses were very attentive so they will know when you finished a dish or tea.

But, I had a problem with the skin.  About 4 out of 10 of the dumpling skins were already broken or broke as we struggled to pull them off the bed of lettuce they sat on.  We're not expert on xlb eating but we're not novices either and we've never had a problem picking them up.  \n\nThe green onion pancake was not what I expected; I'm not a fan.

Again, not a fan.\n\nThe general chicken was good and the vinegar in the sauce definitely stung my eyes as I took a pic of it for Yelp.

I really prefer this place rather than Kingdom of Dumpling that's two blocks away.  Dumpling Kitchen is more spacious, accommodating to large parties, cleaner, and a much better value.  Most of all, their food is delicious!  You can't go wrong!\n\nYou would think they only serve dumplings but their menu is very extensive (144 items!)  Dishes include various specialty dumplings and pot stickers; cold plates and appetizers; numerous mu shu options; soups; noodles and rice dishes; a variety of vegetable, pork, beef, and chicken preparations; and seafood.\n\nMy favorites include:\n\n* Shanghai-Style Steamed Pork Soup Dumplings (10 pcs) $6.50 -  What I would have to say is their signature dish!  Ten plump pork dumplings served in the warm bamboo steamer that burst with a mouthful of soup when you take a bite.  The texture and thinness of the noodle wrapped around the generous pork filling is perfect!  Complemented with the dipping sauce . . .  FABULOUS!  AND what a bargain!  Ten dumplings for only $6.50!\n\n* Beijing-Style Boiled Pork and Chive Dumplings (10 pcs)  $6.50 and\n* Steamed Pork and Napa Cabbage Dumplings (10 pcs)  $6.50 -  Good sized dumplings with flavorful and generous amounts of filling.  The dumplings are more oblong shaped than round, and some tend to stick together when served.  But a couple of more stirs while they're boiling in the hot water would help to separate them. \n\n* Shanghai-Style Chow Mein  ($7.00) -  A tasty blend of wok-fried thick, chewy noodles tossed with plenty of veggies.  Generous portions and not greasy at all!\n\n* Dry-Braised String Beans ($7.00) -  Quite good!  Delicious, slightly crunchy string beans dry fried with flavorful seasoning.\n \n* Mu Shu Pork ($7.95) -  Six light and thin flour pancakes served with a large heap of mu shu pork (vegetables, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, eggs, and pork sauteed in a delicious sauce).  Spread the hoisin sauce on to your pancake, add a few spoonfuls of mu shu pork, wrap it up like a burrito, and you're ready to go . . . HEAVEN!  The texture of the pancake wasn't quite stretchy and elastic enough as it fell apart, but that's ok since the yummy taste of the mu shu pork made up for it!\n \n* Crispy Egg Puffs (3 pcs)  $3.50 -  A nice dessert to end your meal (when it's available and you don't have to wait too long for it to be prepared).  It's not really crispy as the title suggests, but lightly deep fried.  You get three hollow egg puffs, a little larger than the size of an orange, topped with granulated sugar.  The dough is chewy, and with the little bit of sugar, it's DELICIOUS!\n\nThey also offer lunch specials from 11AM - 3PM which consist of various rice plates ranging from $5.50 - $6.50.  \n\nThe service is quite efficient but could be a little more friendly.  However this is typical with many Chinese restaurants.  There is also ample parking so it's convenient.  Dumpling Kitchen has become a frequent stop for my weekend lunches.

I've been in China, and this is very rustic and homely (not the genericized, greasy stuff nor the super fancy \"fusion\" style).  It's definitely not the best, considering all the expensive and fancy Chinese restaurants, but the bang for the buck and authenticity is where this place wins.\n\nI had two dumplings:  the Xiao Long Bao (looks like a tiny pork bun) and a standard steamed pork dumpling.  These were really good, even though we originally ordered a fried pork dumpling and they gave us the steamed one instead.  I also had the hot-sour soup, which was underseasoned but had really good flavor.  We had the seafood stir fried flat noodles (this isn't the \"fun\" style, but more like flat ovals, which is a particular style in Southern China).  These were pretty legit too.  I've had them in Hong Kong and China and I don't recall too many places outside that area that makes noodles in this style correctly.\n\nWell, enough about the food.  The yelp reviews seem to already say the same good stuff about the food.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the crappy service.  First, as mentioned above, they got our order wrong (they gave us steamed dumplings instead of pot stickers).  The place was really slow and we were the waitress's only table.  When we brought up the mistake, she brought the manager over.  The manager asked us what the problem was, and we said there was a mistake.  The waitress then comes out of the kitchen and starts laughing and says \"Oh my, you're right.  I wrote it down correctly but pushed the wrong button on the computer\" (but she said it in Cantonese).  So, she brought out the manager because she thought we were lying or something?\n\nThe other thing is that was kind of weird was that we ordered about 8 things with a group of 4.  EVERYTHING came out the same time.  When the fourth item came out, we told the waitress to slow down the kitchen as we couldn't catch up and didn't have space on our tiny table.  Despite that request, the remainder of the food still came out one by one and our table was just cluttered.\n\nAnd, for some reason, they took away our tea kettle without us noticing (maybe because the table was running out of space because of all the food they were trying to squeeze in)!  And you call yourself a Chinese restaurant?  YOU DON'T TAKE AWAY A CHINAMAN'S TEA!  That's like walking into a house without taking off your shoes!  Ai-ya!\n\nAnyways, it most likely was that the waitress was untrained because my mom has been here before and she said she didn't have any of the problems.  So in summary, awesome authentic food but staff needs to be trained better.  I'll most likely come back again and hopefully it'll be flawless and I'll change my review.", "author": "Alan C."}

So here we were today to celebrate my son's very 1st birthday with his grandparents.\n    I don't know if it's because we came on a Saturday night so service was pretty awful.  I made a reservation for 6pm. We got there on time, sat down, ordered quickly, food came and we started eating. Okay so at approximately 6:24pm (yes, i looked at the time) halfway through our dinner, one of the server, an older lady in her forties came to our table and asked if we needed boxes for the rest of the food that's on our table. We told her we were still working on it and continued eating. She walked away and comes back with to-go boxes and the bill and started clearing our table. We're thinking wtf...?? Okay whatever, it's my son's bday don't wanna ruin the evening. I asked for the cake that I brought in when we got seated. They brought out the cake still in the box. I asked for plates and forks and this other waiter guy asked \"and forks!?\" like it was too much to ask for.  I said \"yes\".  Wtf kind of attitude was that?! Anyways, as we were lighting the \"1\" shaped candle these busboys or whatever were standing there chitchatting that they still had to wait for us to light the candle, sing happy birthday, blah blah blah before they can clean up our table.  Like seriously? You guys had to say it right behind us like we couldn't hear or maybe they just didn't gave a damn. \n   Overall, the food was nothing to rave about.  I thought it was average.  For that quality I can go elsewhere without such horrible, not kid-friendly service.  My mom did told the younger lady in the front counter that they were rude. As if they cared.  Quickest dine-out dinner we've ever had. Didn't mean that in a good way. Will not be back, ever. Good luck with your potty-mouth bussers that walks around casually cursing at each other.

It's definitely a lot more spacious than the other restaurants that we been to.  The dumplings are juicy and tasty.  We ordered the soup dumplings, pan fried pork dumplings, black bean sauce noodles, and a rice roll.  The rice roll wasn't what we were expecting but the hubby absolutely loved it.  It was a chinese donut wrapped in sticky rice with pork sung inside.  He devoured it.  We also got the egg puffs for dessert.  It's a big puffed doughnut covered in sugar.  It's so fluffy and airy and good.  We got here early and it was pretty empty... maybe another table or two, but by the time we left, there was a group of people waiting for a table.

You're not exactly pouring out spoonfuls of broth when you open these, but the dumplings are big and there's enough soup to soak through the meat filling for moist, savory, flavorful awesomeness.  This place also has the best scallion pancake I've ever had, perfectly chewy, not too greasy, and the perfect amount of scallions.

Which restaurant shall reign supreme?\n\nFirst off, this is what I've tried at Dumpling Kitchen.\n------------------------\n+ XLBs are pretty juicy and tasty.\n\n+ Shanghai Style pan-fried pork buns are delicious. The dough is moist and the pork filling is good. I wish they could of pan-fried the bottom just a tad longer to give a more crispy bottom to give a nice contrast to the rest of the bun.\n\n+ Green onion pancake is a lot different compared to the others I have tried. This one is made very thin, almost wafer like. The top of the pancake is wavy due to the dough bubbling up while being fried. This one is not as oily since it has less dough to absorb the oil.\n\n+ The pork and napa cabbage dumpling was a little off. First they were wrapped like a potsticker in a siu gow like wrapper. The filling tasted like they put too much white pepper.\n\n+ The wonton noodle soup was just okay. The wontons were good but I didn't really enjoy the broth or the noodles.\n------------------------\n\nKingdom of Dumpling has a way better variety and quality of dumplings. The only two dishes I really enjoyed at DK are the XLBs and the Pan-fried pork buns.\n\nI also prefer KoD's noodle soups because their broth is more flavorful and they offer more fresh green vegetables and mushrooms. \n\nAlso, KoD has a mean hot sauce which I really dig while DK provides the basic vinegar, soy sauce, hot sauce combination that you find in almost all Asian restaurants.\n\nThe only drawback to KoD is that it is a hole in the wall, so it does get packed quite easily. You do feel like you are eating inside of a kitchen over their. \n\nBut overall, I'd stick with Kingdom of Dumpling to get your dumpling fix but Dumpling Kitchen is a decent alternative if you can't stand the wait when KoD is packed.\n\n++Result++\n\nKoD with a K.O. over DK in the 3rd round.", "author": "Sam T."}

But in my opinion Dumpling Kitchen trumps them both.\n\nHidden along the streets of Taraval, sits this awesome place. Setup and furniture is you typical chinese restaurant, but the real pluses come from the menu itself. Their Xiao Long Bao comes in 10 pieces as opposed to 5-6 with other restaurants and come at roughly the same price ($6). XLB's were juicy and delicious and for once didn't scorch the inside of my mouth so that's always a plus! We also ordered a couple of different items, green onion pancakes,  Dry Fried chicken wings, and crispy egg puffs. Pancakes were fluffy and yummy, crispy egg puffs were light, sweet and a nice way to end the meal, dry fried chicken wings however weren't so hot. In reality the wings were covered in soo much sauce, so much that they were difficult to pick up with chopsticks and was unnecessarily messy, however that's the only blemish from Dumpling Kitchen.\n\nIn terms of service, I have no complaints, overall they're friendly and attentive. The restaurant itself has ample seating for a variety of groups and parking around the area isn't too bad but remember it is in a residential area.\n\nOverall I think this will be the dumpling restaurant we go to until said otherwise, and I'm sure you'll agree with me!", "author": "Ryan C."}

A couple of friends and I were in the mood for Shanghai soup dumplings and when the popular restaurant that first came to mind was crowded on a Sunday afternoon, we settled for Dumpling Kitchen. And by no means was it settling, as the food and service were great! \n\nHere's what we ordered: \n\nShanghai pork dumplings - YUM! The filling and soup were very tasty, and soup's temperature wasn't scalding hot. The dumpling casing was exactly how I like into super doughy, and more like a pot sticker. I'd definitely order it again! \n\nDumplings in chili sauce - Couldn't decide on the other dumpling to try, and since my dining companions and I all favor spicy foods, opted for this. Glad we did! The dumplings were a perfect size, filling filled with seemingly good ingredients and well balanced in flavor. The chili sauce the dumplings were swimming brought them over...I may have had more than my share of dish. \n\nBeef with mixed vegetables - Sounds boring, but we all enjoyed it immensely. Again, the ingredients were good quality, veggies (baby bok choy, carrots and maybe another that I have already forgotten) beef cooked well in a not too salty brown sauce. \n\nBlack bean sauce noodles -We were expecting jajangmyun-like (Korean noodles) noodles, but wasn't the case at all. The noodles were al dente, sauce was more a meat sauce that tasted slightly like black bean, and thinly sliced cucumbers brought a nice freshness and texture to the dish. The entire ordered was devoured! \n\nThe restaurant is actually pretty spacious. The service was fairly quick and attentive. One server seemed out of it, but at least another picked up her \"slack\" so we were well taken care of at all times. I'd go again, and wouldn't be surprised if it's with the same two dining companions...and soon!", "author": "Marie B."}

We noticed that the restaurant was a bit small. \n\nAfter we sat down, we took a look at the menu and decided on three items.

The dumplings were tasty and I liked it. 10 pieces was quite a lot for only two people. The beef stew was a bit spicy but not to the point where my nose was running and I couldn't handle it. Some of the meat was a bit tough and hard to chew. There was a good amount of noodles and plenty of flavor. We were unable to finish the last noodle dish due to the portions of the noodle soups.

It's been open for about 2 weeks now but even on a rainy day, they were pretty packed for a Sunday afternoon.  \n\nI think the one thing that makes this place really unique are their version of hand pulled noodles.  Usually, hand pulled noodles at any and every other place I've tried them are thicker.  This place they are thin and look like just regular non hand pulled noodles.  But my mom did ask the waitress just to confirm and she did indeed confirm that they make it a little different here.  Can't say they were out of this world but they were good nonetheless.  \n\nWe ordered a couple of lunch special rice plates as well but I would say skip those if you are here as their dumplings and noodle dishes are the star of the show.  The Lionhead Meatball was pretty good too and they had some cold appetizers I liked.  So I think the only thing to really avoid are rice plates as they are nothing special here.    \n\nAt this point, they are giving a 10% discount and not sure it'll last but I am assuming it's a first month Grand Opening Special.

Green beans, bland. Xiao long bao, bland. We did the set meal and added a few dishes. Nothing really stood out to me except for their sugared donut pastry at the end which I almost passed on because it looked like it would immediately induce diabetes... Good thing the boyfriend insisted that I try some because it was actually really good.. The rest of the food I can't recommend... All I have to say is I'm Shanghainese and the xiao long bao did not live up to standards.", "author": "Lily Z."}

My boyfriend and I were next in line for a table, and the restaurant offered to seat us earlier at one of the large family tables where we would share with another small party. I didn't mind but other parties seemed like they did. My boyfriend and I ended up eating at the large table of 8 alone, but hey, more space for us right?\n\nI haven't eaten at a Shanghainese restaurant since I was a kid. Therefore I couldn't pass up green onion pancakes and hot sweet soymilk! I wanted to go for the fried doughnuts too, but my health conscious side wouldn't allow it. The green onion pancakes were done just right! Not too salty, and fluffly- unlike the ones you can just get at a supermarket and fry at home. The soymilk was a great addition to the meal as well. We also ordered regular xiao long bao, crab xiao long bao, and garlic vegetables. The xiao long baos were delicious and soupy! I agreed with another reviewer that they could be hotter but they were the best ones I've had in the area. The crab xiao long bao's tasted fattier, but I liked them even more than the regular. \n\nNext time I come here, I will definitely get the xiao long bao (either regular or crab)! I want to try their other dumplings, and their shredded pork rice balls with the sweet soymilk- would bring back old breakfast memories. \n\nA lot of reviewers compare this place to Kingdom of Dumpling a few blocks away. I've never had the XLB there, but I do think the ambience and service at Dumpling Kitchen is more welcoming.", "author": "Grace S."}

I drove by it multiple times and tried to ignore the fact that I had lost one of my favorite eateries.  That said, the other day, I cast aside my sadness to begrudgingly visit the new tenant \"Dumpling Kitchen\"- but only at the suggestion of my sweet mom-in-law!\n\nOnce inside, I found the decor largely the same as the old Han Goeng, but missing the fish tanks - now sealed behind a block of walnut veneer. Hey, no big deal, remember - this is a REAL Chinese restaurant, where the focus is on the food - NOT the surroundings! =)\n\nOnce seated, we pulled the usual stuff off the menu  (dumplings, XLBs, potstickers, shanghai pork buns, etc.), as if we were visiting Kingdom of Dumpling.   Once our order arrived, I was more than surprised at seeing and tasting the absolutely terrific shanghai pork buns. They were perfectly fried with a evenly-browned, ever so slightly burnt bottom.  The same treatment goes for their potstickers, which were also delectable, as the meat inside was still very juicy as you bite into them. For this, and the Shanghai pork buns, I will keep coming back again and again!  THE BEST I've ever had - and the driving reason behind this five-star rating.  The Shanghai Pork buns imho, I consider MUCH better than the starchier, less fried renditions I've tasted elsewhere.   Not even in the same league. Not even close.  The XLBs here were terrific as well. Very juicy, with perfect chewy tender skin that you bite through to reveal the very juicy insides.. YUM!\n\nThat said, I wasn't quite as impressed with their dumplings, as I prefer the ones from KOD that wear a thicker skin and a rounder not-so-fun-gor shape.   Either way, I WILL return to Dumpling Kitchen.  Can't wait to go back for the Shanghai Pork Buns and Potstickers!", "author": "Harry W."}

Not only did they have cheap onion pancakes for $3, they had xiao lung baos for $6! My boyfriend and I ended up over ordering since everything on the menu was so cheap. \n\nTheir dumplings were nice and juicy and didn't break when you picked them up with the chopstick... the only complaint I had was tha the pork inside was too mushy... It didn't have a nice consistency compared to well-- Ding Tai Fung. I enjoyed their onion pancake, but it doesn't look or taste like the traditional kind you have in mind. It's puffy and really light. I can't describe it... The potstickers weren't special and I think it could have been a bit more crispy. The beef noodle stew had bland noodles and the beef was chewy.\n\nMy family came again and we ordered almost the same dishes because I \nwanted them to try it. I think they would have given it a 2-stars.  \n\n\nThe thing I would give an A+ to is the hot soymilk and the sugar egg donuts (the name of the dish totally slipped my mind at the moment).

She's the type of lady who ONLY eats Chinese food, but not just any Chinese food because it has got to be from her region of China. Surprisingly she loves Shanghai dumplings and fell in love with the one on Balboa. They were on vacation so we decided to try this place.  \n\nThe Shanghai dumplings here were so mouthwatering juicy that I'm still thinking about it!  It was a clear favorite, while the crab dumplings were eh.  They had pan-fried pork buns, which was outstanding.  It was the perfect amount of bun and meat that I gobbled it all down.  The Shanghai chow mein and snow peas with garlic were so good that I tasted the wok it was made in.  I'm not even sure how to describe that, but my parents call it wok air.  Your stove has to heat up really high to get the wok to cook your food a certain way, which we can't do at home.  My mom talks about that a lot so its ingrained in me to think that way when I eat.\n\nThe family favorite is the Lion Head Soup because of the house broth with vegetables and clear noodles.  It's not the lion head that we like though it does give it some flavor... we're a vegetable inclined kind of family so we noticed how absolutely amazing this soup is.  It is delicious.

The soup in the XLBs had a higher grease content than the last time (though it's nothing compared to the melted fat disaster that was my experience at Joe's Shanghai in NYC's Chinatown several weeks ago).  Where Dumpling Kitchen kind of missed were the other two items I ordered: five spice beef noodle soup and pot stickers.\n\nThe noodle soup was wrong on two fronts: 1. The beef stew was tough. 2. The restaurant used Cantonese egg noodles instead of the expected wheat flour noodles. The item on the menu has an image of a chili pepper next to it, but the heat was negligible.\n\nPot Stickers: A failure in my mind. They came out with a noticeable green filling seen through the wrapper. The problem is Dumpling Kitchen uses Shanghai Bok Choy instead of cabbage (either napa or regular) mixed in with the meet.  What were they thinking?  I wish someone had warned me because I would not have ordered the pot stickers had I known.", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

These didn't have much heat to them and were basically just sitting in a pool of vinegar which I hated.  I also wanted some broiled green beans which they didn't offer as an appetizer. BUMMER!  I'll have to go to Shanghai Dumpling King for these.  \n\nIf you have leftovers, a woman will come to your table and package it for you.  This was like dinner and a show.

I came here twice with family and both times were quite delicious! It's really not much to look at from the inside out and some of the waitresses might be a little blunt and honest to you, but I think this is slowly growing to be one of my preferred choice for Shanghai food!\n\nAmong the great choices are the Xiao Long Bao, San Jin Bao and Preserved Vegetables and Meat Noodle Soup. All of these are my personal favorites and only a handful of places do it right! The Xiao Long Bao had a juicy meat center with flavor-explosive soup and all that with a dumpling skin that doesn't break easily! The San Jin Bao was done with a crispy bottom, soft exterior and a meat-in-your-mouth meaty core! The noodle soup was like comfort food to me and it was perfect for chilly weather! I don't know how else to describe it, but to have you try it! \n\nI can think of the Shanghai Dumpling in Millbrae that could do the same quality of food, but Dumpling Kitchen is much easier to get to.

I've had similar dumplings at other places and I could taste a sweeter flavor in the meat filling.\n*It costs more and there are less dumplings in this order.

The bun surrounding the meat was soft and doughy and the bottom is seared to perfection. \n*I would recommend ordering this dish.\n\nPork Dumplings in Chili Oil (10pcs) \n*10 Pieces.\n*These were typical steamed pork dumplings swimming in a light chili oil. I didn't taste anything extremely spicy with the sauce.\n\nLion Head meatballs with vegetable in house broth\n*4 Pieces.\n*The meatballs are HUGE. Imagine them being the size of a clenched fist.  The meatballs themselves are really moist and juicy.\n*The broth is pretty light and is accompanied with vermicelli noodles and various vegetables like spinach, carrots, and mushrooms. \n\nShanghai-style Stir-Fried Rice Cakes\n*There was a good amount of pork and veggies, but I found this dish overall pretty oily and bland.\n*I would recommend passing on this dish.\n\nCrispy Egg Puffs (3pcs) \n*3 Pieces.\n*The Crispy Eff puffs were a great way to end the meal with something sweet. These puff pastries were coated in sugar and were nice and airy on the inside.\n*They weren't exactly the freshest because they weren't piping hot when they arrived at our table. There were still crispy though and that's a good sign.\n\nIt's great to have found a new Shanghai dumpling restaurant in the Sunset.

I was in complete tofu heaven last night! It has just the right amount of spice, saltiness, sweetness... YUM. As a matter of fact, going to have the leftovers for lunch soon - can't wait!\n\nNow.. onto the food... this is what we got:\n\n* crab and pork dumplings - a little bit sweet, a little gingery, the meat was smooth... totally delectable. I could have had another order all to myself... :)\n* XLB - again, smooth meat (versus a little bit lumpy and with more texture like KOD)... a little too sweet for my taste. \n* wontons in chilli oil - pretty good. the wonton skin was a little tough and there were too many ginger pieces for my taste but good overall.\n* mapo tofu - of course! it's what I get at every Chinese restaurant and this, my friends, is something I'd come back for again and again!\n* bean curd salad - thought it's be like the bean curd salad at KOD but it is not.. they use the sweetened tofu with dark skin for this salad and a lot of celery... which I didn't care for. \n\nDumpling Kitchen is bigger in restaurant size, too. The staff is very nice. The restaurant is bright and clean. So... if KOD is crowded or you want to try something new and tasty, Dumpling Kitchen is a great alternative! \n\nIt was only the two of us... otherwise we'd have gotten the potstickers, the strings beans, more dumplings... but this just means we'll have to go back soon and try more!

It was smooth and quite tasty.  We had a saucy noodle dish, chow fun, crab & pork XLB, XLB, Lion Head Meatball and a plate of pickled cucumbers.\n\nAlthough the food came out very quick, it was quite underwhelming.  The lion head was good, but was cold on the inside and had a slight tint of pink to it.  The XLB were quite subpar.  You can taste that the quality of the meat is a little subpar.\n\nThe most outrageous thing was the portions.  We ordered a saucy noodle and did not have enough to fill 7 bowls!

There was a lot of soup in each dumpling and the XLB didn't pop the second I picked one up.  However, the XLB lacked flavor... it was just average to me.\n- Dry fried chicken (boneless): had a nice tangy flavor to it, but was completely soggy.  When I think of dry fried chicken, I immediately imagine the crunchy, honey goodness of San Tung's chicken.......I was sorely mistaken.  Think more like Panda Express, minus the delicious fast food flavor, and chewed up a few times and then served.\n- Shanghai-style chow mein: reallly disappointing and flavorless.  The noodles were overcooked and soggy, and they didn't have a nice al-dente bite to it.\n- Crispy egg puffs: delicious!!!! It's a cross between those small egg puffs served at the Asian dessert houses, and those fist-sized cream puffs (minus the cream).  There's a lot of white sugar on top, but you can easily shake it off if there's too much for your taste.  Most importantly, it is NOT greasy like Chinese donuts. I like. I approve.\n\nOverall, for a place that calls itself Dumpling Kitchen, I would expect the dumplings to crawl in my mouth and die (in a good way).  The prices were really cheap and the egg puffs were delicious, and maybe the other dumplings are better (but then they should move them up to #1 on the menu instead of the XLB).....

The pancake portion was a little too thick for me though, but I would order them again nonetheless\nChow Mein: there was ooodles of noodles in this dish PLUS chicken, beef, and shrimp.  you def. get a bang for your buck with this dish.  The only thing is it was a little to salty for me\nChive dumplings: these are pretty tasty, must try if you're a chive fan\nSpicy wonton: beware! if your palette doesnt enjoy spicy food, it may be too spicy for you!  I enjoyed these, i think they put some chili oil on top of regular won tons\nEgg rolls: This dish came with about 6 rolls and crispy, but not TOO oily.  I enjoyed this dish as well\nEgg puffs: OMG delish!!  they were fresh and melting in my mouth!  i loved these...i think they're better than koi palace!\n\nOVERALL, you must try this place.. great prices and great food.", "author": "Kristen T."}

The restaurant has that typical chinese dim sum vibe and look to it. It seats about 40 people or so, and this place is popular so expect to wait to get seated. Service is also pretty standard for an asian restaurant meaning they're a little rough around the edges, and they want you in and out as soon as possible but that's to be expected. More importantly, the food is spot on here. The dumplings are great, and so are the entrees. I usually get an order of the soup dumplings, and then get an entree or two to share.

Now this place is only a few blocks away from the other dumpling place, so I wanted to see how this compares.\n\nCame here tonight to try it..I believe this is their first opening weekend. We were greeted and seated immediately. The place was packed for a grand opening! We looked around to see what everyone was ordering before making a decision. \n\nWe decided to order Shanghai-style steamed pork dumplings (10 pieces for $6), Shanghai-style pan fried buns (8 pieces for $5.50), Wontons in chili oil (10 pieces for $5.50), and Noodles in peanut sauce ($6). The shanghai dumplings were tasty, but there wasn't a lot of soup in the dumplings. Probably because they steam it on parchment paper or some kind of paper- so it sticks and when you try to pick up the dumpling it rips a little and the soup spills out. Other places steam on a piece of cabbage/napa cabbage...and that seems to work really well. So, the reason why we ordered the shanghai pan fried buns was because we saw every table ordering it! I'm glad we did, because these were basically pan-fried shanghai dumplings! These were really delicious, juicy and flavorful! The wontons in chili oil were really good as well - it was more of a chili-soy sauce, and not dunked in oil (which is good). The noodles in peanut sauce was spicy, but while it was tasty, I felt the noodles wasn't the right type of noodles. \n\nOverall, there were lots of hits, and a couple of misses. Next time I do want to try the green onion pancake and the shanghai-style chow mein. Those seem to be a favorite of the restaurant as well! I also did notice that they has the dried fried chicken wings, and the black bean sauce noodles that I also want to try.  Service was a little spotty and some of my food came out slowly, but again this is the first weekend, so hopefully any kinks will be worked out. Also 10% off - either because of their Grand Opening Special..or they really liked me! =P Overall the prices are cheap, food is good, and the restaurant is clean.

It's so close to Kingdom of Dumpling too, so I was curious to see how it compares. \n\nI love dumpling shops so I really wanted to like this place, but it just left me going eh...\n1. The food\nShanghai XLB-- they were decent if you don't try to compare these soup dumplings to other places (or Kingdom of Dumpling a few blocks down). The wrappers were a tad too mushy (steamed too long?) and the filling was extra gingery, which I liked.\nDrunken chicken-- good.\nPotstickers-- not crispy on the bottom. they could have been cooked a little longer, but our food was taking SO long that they started to rush...but i'll explain that in part 2.\nRice cakes w/ pork and pickled veggies-- just ok; I've had better, and it just tasted like a lot of black pepper and some extra salty spots\nBeijing style pork dumplings-- not good; I expected these to be the best dumplings ever after waiting 40 minutes for them and since the restaurant name has \"dumpling\" in it! The dumpling wrappers were mushy (probably boiled too long) and the filling also too mushy (my mom said too much water mixed in the meat)\n...these 5 ok dishes took a total of 40 minutes for it to arrive! which brings me to \n\n2. Service\nThe servers(probably the owner/chef's wife and daughter) were nice and very apologetic, but it really didn't make up for how long it took our food to come out! After we ordered, the XLB came out in 5 mins--thats fast. Then nothing for a good 10 minutes. After my parents complained, they bring out the drunken chicken...which is a dish that is already pre-cooked!  I timed the meal; we didn't get the last dish, the dumplings that my boyfriend deemed \"the worst dumplings ever,\" until 40 mins after we ordered. Which might be fine if I were eating a 3-course meal at a French restaurant! But when I eat Chinese, I expect the dishes to come out all at once or one closely after the other! They gave us the 10% off (that other yelpers found from their coupon online) to make up for the service.\n\nMaybe I'll try this place again for takeout in a few months, when they get their act together, and have improved their dumplings, because like I said, I really want to like a dumpling place. Also, they do serve a lot of dishes like dry fried chicken and similar types of dishes they serve at San Tung. Maybe those are good and I'll try them as takeout, but I won't have high expectations. Plus the servers were really nice and apologized profusely. Oh and the prices are pretty cheap, but that doesn't really matter when it's just so-so food.", "author": "Jessie C."}

This could be good or bad because she could end up not even being able to smell all that goodness after a while because she'll get so used to it. The good news is that she'll get to eat there whenever she wants.  My wife and I were visiting SF over the weekend so of course we had to try this place.  You walk in the door and you are immediately hit by great smelling Chinese food.  This is a small place that seats maybe 25 or 30 people so we had to wait but not too long because we went kind of late on Saturday night.  We ordered pot stickers that were absolutely perfectly cooked, and we shared an order an order of Eggplant in Garlic Sauce which had a huge depth of flavor, the Chicken in Black Bean Sauce which I felt was very lack luster and also an order of Shanghai Noodles that were great.  As we looked around the restaurant we saw dishes come out of the kitchen that looked and smelled amazing. The service was very good as the wait staff all seemed to help each other out and we had 3 different people at least bring out our dishes, fill our waters and generally just answer questions.  The place was clean and nicely decorated too.  The one major down side for me though was how hot it was inside.  The front door was wide open but it didn't help much unless the MUNI went speeding by out on Taraval and it would create a breeze inside.  All in all though this is a very good restaurant and I recommend it highly.  I like too that it's kind of off the beaten path so you shouldn't have to wait too long for a table.

So not much value for the money.\n\nDumpling is the specialty, there are other special dishes also.\n\nPlease note the food has MSG so if you are allergic, it can give you headaches.\n\nThe food is average in quantity but food tasted pretty good.\n\n4/5 for food.\n4/5 for service.\n\nSince I'm allergic to MSG, I probably will not go back. \n\nHad to take Advil for the intense headaches afterwards.", "author": "W.

I'll probably come here on average once every 2-3 weeks and they've never disappointed.  Service is fast, they accommodate large groups, and the xiao long baos (both steamed and pan fried) are delicious. While Kingdom of Dumpling up the street is probably a bit tastier, Dumpling Kitchen is definitely a good alternative if the wait is too long.", "author": "Stephen C."}

Came with my roomie and she had her bike and they let her store her bike inside since she didn't have a lock yet so that was nice of them.  I usually just eat dumplings when I'm here.  Nothing superb or anything but they're still good.", "author": "Hwan L."}

I've long loved their potstickers, as well as their Shanghai-style fried noodles with savory soy milk. The family style vibe makes it a comfortable place to come visit, but really, what bothers me is how the place gets when crowded. The food quality slips, and people rudely like to just sit down at empty seats despite the fact that there is a list of people waiting. I was also shocked one day to have had a plate of potstickers set on the table and then promptly snatched away again AFTER I had touched one with my  chopsticks. It was promptly given to the next table over, which I think was because the lady thought we didn't order it, but regardless, you should never just take a plate and give it to someone else. It's a health hazard, and it's just not something someone is going to eat after seeing that.", "author": "Travis L."}

A predominantly non-Cantonese restaurant, the food was superb! I vastly enjoyed their exquisite #1 Shanghai-style steamed pork dumplings (xiao long bao, XLB), #5 Shanghai-style pan-fried pork buns, #7 Beijing-style boiled pork and chive dumplings and #45 Shanghai-style chow mein. The XLBs had a thin wrapping encasing the prized and substantive juices and were served with a ginger-vinegar sauce. I was surprised the pan-fried pork buns were just as juicy as the XLBs. I thought they were going to be like the Cantonese barbecued pork steamed buns, but their pork buns were more like dumplings with a light, BREADY (not similar to the XLB's) wrapping. The pork and chive dumplings were also high quality and packed with meat; I only wished they served some kind of house dipping sauce. The Shanghai-style chow mein, consisting of thick noodles, minced pork, the green stalk of scallions, onions and carrots, was flavorful and filling.\n\nTwo of DK's menu items were unremarkable: #14 green onion pancake and #19 Chinese fried dough (Chinese donut). Their #14 isn't what I expected: it was non-flaky, somewhat bland but with subtle notes of green onion (needed some salt and pepper), and more similar to American-style pancakes. But I must say the pancake was huge and is good if you want to eat bread. Their Chinese fried dough lacked the airiness, flakiness and holes that I usually find in Chinese donuts eaten with congee.\n\nNot only is their food satisfying, their service is top-notch fast and friendly. I was impressed when they boxed up our leftovers for us, unlike most if not all Cantonese restaurants in The City!", "author": "Cliff W."}

I am very spoiled since I have had food such as this at an SF restaurant.  They are obviously well known for their dumpling.  We got the pork dumpling and the vegetable dumpling.  We also got beef noodles with some large noodles that I've never had before at any other restaurant, and some tofu with vegetables.  All the food came out quick.  The dumplings especially the pork dumpling was delicious and well made.  It was crunchy on the bottom and came with a nice special sauce.  The noodles were well done as well and all in all, everything was fabulous. Their service was good on the day we were here, we had ran out of tea and lifted the lid and immediately it was filled.  But then again we came when it was a later lunch, around 2:30pm.  We got to see the staff eat their lunch and they still brought us the check relatively quick even though most of them were eating.  I enjoyed this place and will be back after I check out the other dumpling place down the street to compare.", "author": "Eating And Living Well U."}

Good food, clean environment, and reasonable pricing. Pot stickers, dumpling, shanghai noodles, fish head soups are all delicous (fresh tasting but not too salty or MSG flavor).  Spicy chicken wings and fish filet taste just right.  Also, we always order soy milk and it tastes good cold or hot.  They also serve the chinese sugar donuts that kids would love.", "author": "Annie L."}

The xiao long bao, the prize of shanghai restaurants was very very average, it seemed like the microwaved it though because the outside looked dry but the inside was relatively hot and there was nos team coming out of it. The hot and sour soup, drunken chicken, shanghai style rice cakes were all very good, but the daddy of entree's came in the form of the dried fried chicken (i think thats the english name). OOOOH MANNNN it was pretty freaking bomb. But yeah the service is kinda iffy you can defenitely tell that these people are new to owning a restaurant, they tend to forget things but they are very very friendly. overall a pretty decent experience maybe it'll get better next time", "author": "Preston L."}

Sorry, but I am forever a fan to Joe's when it comes to XLB. The egg puffs at DK was so heavenly!  It's nice and airy with lots of egg flavor and granulated sugar sprinkled on top (traditional chinese style, not the powdered sugar)!!  and each puff was huge!  The Shanghainese pan fried bun is good but my husband wasn't a fan (said the meat was a little to mushy for him and made the bun a little soggy). The thin fried green onion pan cake wasn't as greasy as other places but wish it was packed with more onion. We also ordered the stir fried string beans and my son scarfed it up (he's very pick about his string beans). And you've got to try their soy milk, I definitely loved it!!  Just the right amount of sweetness, smooth and very fresh.  I'd go back and try the other stuff like the jia jia mein in the future  ...", "author": "Sassy G."}
