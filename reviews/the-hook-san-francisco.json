It was Christmas Day and packed, so instead of being more selective about where we chose chowder, we instead opted for a shorter wait time.  Hook & Cook, even though we waited 10 minutes or so in line before ordering, won (unfortunately for us.)\n\nLook, I know you're hungry--you've had to fight traffic just getting down to the pier, and you've spent time searching for over-priced parking--and since you're already here, you're kind of at the mercy to whatever restaurants are made available.  And I also know that you're thinking \"fresh\" clam chowder would hit the spot about now.  But here at Hook & Cook, the clam chowder isn't fresh.  It's from a can.  And it's pricey, over $8.00 for what little you'll receive in that sourdough bowl you've been eyeing.  Maybe you should just move on.\n\nHow do I know it's not fresh?  Check out the potatoes: the uniformity, the perfect cubes.  It's processed, canned.  Hook & Cook certainly isn't promoting \"fresh\" clam chowder, and that's fine, but neither are they revealing the chowder's  true origins.  I'm not bashing Hook & Cook or anything; I'm just letting you know what you're getting, that's all.\n\nAdded, we also ordered fried calamari (see photo).  I'm not sure as to why our $9.25 order of previously frozen calamari was half-filled with french fries, but it was; however, given the chowder letdown, we didn't question.

I was on the pier after all.  The sign for this place intrigued me. I know I'm not supposed to 'judge a book by it's cover' but this 'cover' was neat, and I went in to eat. The outside tables were full, and the inside tables were also full. It's a pretty crowded place! I guess they're doing well. \n     I walked over to the lengthy line, and stood for a moment, when a girl opened up another register and shouted 'I'll take whoever's next!\" I looked, and the people in front of me appeared to be staying, so I switched lines to place my order. I looked up at the menu board, and decided upon Clam Chowder in a bread bowl, and an order of garlic fries. I went with the 'San Francisco' style as I'm from New England, and have experienced more than my fair share of 'New England' style clam chowder.  I paid, and before the transaction was done, a bowl of soup was placed in front of me. I picked it up, and found some counter space to sit at.\n     Before too long my garlic fries were ready, and I went up to get them. I returned to my counter spot, and after the yelp photo, I began to eat. The chowder was an orange-ish shade, but it was still delicious.  Clams and shrimp were in this version of chowder. It was warm, and slowly seeping into the Sourdough bread bowl. After eating the soup, and bowl...I was actually quite full. But I did manage to stuff down about half the order of garlic fries. The garlic fries were just okay. The chowder was rightfully the main dish.\n\n     I may or may not be back? There's alot of stuff on Pier 39 to see and eat at. This one was good, but lots of other places caught my eye (and stomach) to see next time.", "author": "Scott B."}

Tall order in the middle of the summer and in San Francisco :-)\n\nThe service here was pretty quick which was a plus. The seating of course was sparse, but that is to be expected. The main reason they get stars taken off is because there was really very little that a vegetarian could eat. My daughter had to have french fries and mozzarella sticks. I eat fish, so of course that wasn't a problem :-) no, I don't have any suggestions on what they should serve for vegetarians. \n\nFish and chips were pretty decent. The batter was light, and they were nice and hot, but the portion could've been a bit larger. One thing that gets five stars is the coleslaw. Usually coleslaw sauce is way too sweet and gooey. This was more like cabbage and cilantro tossed in a bit of vinegar, which was just delicious.\n\nThe napkins were pretty small and we needed to take a whole lot of them for our greasy fingers :-) \n\nThey had samples of all of the food items out so that you could see them when you were ordering. That was convenient. Overall, not a bad place for the family for a quick fried fish treat.", "author": "Rene B."}

Had to ask for my drink because they weren't going to give it to me --and apparently they were supposed to give it after I paid for my order while waiting for my food. It wasn't busy but it was a longer wait than what it should have been. Several others got their order before me and they had been behind me in line.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-17", "description": "Hellllll nope.\n\nWe came here a few weeks ago because I thought it looked cool and there were a lot of customers inside. I guess we came at the wrong time because the employees looked done for the day.\n\nThe lady who took our order was a bit rude. We've never been here before, so I'm sorry that we were a bit confused. Basically, you tell someone what you want and they send/tell the person at the register what it is. We ordered clam chowder in a bread bowl and fish and chips. Instead of regular fries with the fish, we wanted to upgrade it to garlic fries. This seemed to piss the lady off and I could tell she was trying to shove us towards the register as fast as she could.\n\nAt the register, however, a different lady was nice. The only part that wasn't so nice was the price. From what I can remember, everything was close to $30, but that's Pier 39 for ya. Even still - that's way too high. \n\nFinding a place to sit was interesting. Most of the front dining area was taken but they have a small hall of picnic tables. As I was walking over to that section, one of the male employees pulled out one of the benches to block the walkway. I looked at him confused and he just kinda looked at me like nothing was wrong. Yo, I had my hands full and I wanted to sit. He told me that we couldn't sit over in that area but there was a large family at the very end of the hall. They were loud and drunk, it seemed like. I told him I wanted to and he finally moved the bench. Okay, I understand that we were there 15 minutes before you guys closed, and I honestly hate being \"that person,\" but we didn't know about your hours. What he did was absolutely rude, in my opinion. There was a time where he was refilling the condiments on the table and he just grabbed the ketchup bottle or whatever from our table without saying excuse me. Aight. He also stood around our table for a while just checking himself out in the mirror... It was kinda creepy. \n\nAnyway, the food. I thought the clam chowder was okay. It had a smoky flavor to it, which I'm not a fan of. It did taste like it came straight out of a can and the consistency matched canned clam chowder (overly thick). The bread bowl was stale and rough. If the clam chowder doesn't soften the bread bowl enough to where you can easily rip the bread apart, then it's all wrong. I was seriously putting a lot of effort in tearing up that bowl. As for the fish, it was waaaaayyy too greasy. The funny thing was that there was more breading than the actual fish. Finally, the garlic fries were not okay. I honestly do not like garlic fries but I've had better. They put a lot of garlic but it was just a pile that fell right off of the fries when you picked them up. Because of that, the fries barely had the flavor. \n\nI guess this place is worth a shot, but there are better places with similar food choices. For me, I don't think I will return. The service turned me off and the food was definitely not worth the price. \n\nHell nope.", "author": "D C."}

The fish and chip only came with 3 small pieces of friend fish fillet and a small order of fries that were soggy.\n\nAnd get this; it took them 15 mins to get a premade meal out. All they had to do is put it in their 1000 degree fryer and pour the premade PROGRESSO clam chowder in the breadbowl! There was only 2 orders in front of us.\n\nDam I regret coming here. I have no one to blame but myself. Why did I not go to the other 99 GREAT seafood restaurant at the PIER!!!!????\n\nStay away. Don't be tricked in here because alot of clueless tourist is sitting outside and it make this place seem decent. It's not!\n\nDon't be hook into this place, not even considered a restaurant, I will call it a place. Because once you are hooked, you are cooked!!!!\n\nSo unless you want you want to dine with pigeons and eat premade fake clam chowder at a fake seafood restaurant, be my guest.

It took us a while. The crab chowder was a crab and shrimp chowder that was tomato-based, and it was really good. I still liked the original clam chowder, but it was definitely worth a try. I thought it was a little cheaper than some of the other places on the pier.\n\nBottomline: Good stuff! My other friends ordered a salmon ciabatta (which was delightful) and a chicken ciabatta.

I was content at the fair pricing in an expensive city (and an expensive part of an expensive city). When I arrived home I unpacked my light dinner. My first impression was that both items were surprisingly greasy looking. The chowder had a \"slick\" of oil on it. Although the soup was salted and seasoned to perfection, I was not pleased with the oily texture and total lack of crab and shrimp :( The slaw was un impressive as well. It was pretty oily and not very crispy due to not being chilled (like on ice or kept in a fridge). In the restaurant's defense, I will add that the slaw is typically an add-on to sandwiches and wraps as a condiment or a garnish for dinner plates.

The cooks took 15 minutes to cook my meal but the rest of my party's was done in 5 minutes and after all that the manager refused to give me a discount on a drink refill. STAY AWAY!!!!", "author": "Christian T."}

Other than that, the experience was...meh. I ordered the seafood crab cake, which is basically a small patty inside hamburger buns. The garlic fries is disgusting and the chowder was average.", "author": "Talle R."}

I think there all about get in eat get out as quick as possible. Oh yeah and if you want a refill on your small soda its gonna cost $.82 that's damn near buying another soda, and all I got was attitude from the employees like I wasting there time. I don't recommend unless you are in a hurry and trying to get out quick.", "author": "Carlos S."}

It's fast and they have the standard bread bowl clam chowder and an array of fried seafood and chips. But nothing stood out as a must go back. It was ok for what it was. Better clam chowder elsewhere.", "author": "Grace C."}

The only thing that was kind of weird was that fact that they served fish and chips on one side and chicken and ribs on the other side.  Same restaurant some owners just kinda random.  The food was good and fresh.", "author": "May A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-19", "description": "I'm a bit surprised to see this place got such low reviews. San Francisco sure is spoiled, the clam chowder bowls here are still better than any you'll find in the san joaquin valley. Not everyone wants to pay 12 bucks for a clam chowder bowl at a fancy restaurant. For poor college students just taking a day trip, this place is just right. My only complaint is that the bottom of the bowl was more bread than chowder. Other than that, it was great. Obviously nobody would come specifically here for the food, but if you just want the food without the fuss, Hook & Cook will do just fine.", "author": "Byron C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-01-23", "description": "I ordered the seafood combo. It was pricey & boring.  I guess it's pretty standard at Pier 39.  The most concern I have is the pigeons.  They are not shy coming into the eating area inside.  I didn't see any staff trying to clean up the tables during my visit.  I'll not come back because of the pigeons.", "author": "C S."}

What wasn't understandable however was the fact that it took freakin forever just to fry some fish and chips, I was on the verge of telling them to just refund my order when bam it was finally done. As for the food, the name \"hook & cook\", would imply that everything is caught from the sea and cooked here; nope! it all came from a package which pisses me off even more that it took forever for my order to arrive... to take something out the package and throw it in the fryer shouldn't take damn near 30 minutes when the restaurant is completely empty(It seemed like there was something wrong with each batch they kept frying up when I watched them making it, they would throw it in the trashcan and fry up a new batch). Oh and the service...lol don't even get me started on that.", "author": "Mike A."}
