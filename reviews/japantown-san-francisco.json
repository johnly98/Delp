They have the east and west \nMalls that are filled with shops for all. From jewelry to souvenirs to toys, anime, swords, books and many more. \n\nThe place is full of ramen restaurants to sushi and desert and coffee and ice cream shops. \n\nThey also feature the Cherry Blossom Festival which is always the best time to visit, which I believe is always around the month on April. You might want to google it to find out the exact dates but it is a great festival with music, food, drinks, shows and more food. The festival runs for two weekends. A must place to visit it great and great way to enjoy and support the many fund raising booths from the sale of food at their food booths.", "author": "Andrew M."}

It was either go for some tempura or go for some sukiyaki. I have many fond memories with my parents near the intersection of Post & Buchanan. There are the 2 main shopping areas that are on either side of the Peace Pagoda. One is a little smaller but now has a huge Daiso market in it. The other side has bakeries such as Andersen Bakery, restaurants such as Marufuku Ramen and Japanese car accesories store Auto Freak. \n\nBut the sights arent limited to this area. You have a few city blocks across the street that have Yasukochi's Sweet Shop and their terrific coffee crunch cake, Benkyodo for authentic mochi that sells out by morning and Super Mira Market (where Yasukochi is located) that has Japanese groceries and ready made food to-go. \n\nThere are Hawaiian stores, other ramen and izakaya shops that you just have to walk around and see it for yourself. There is plenty to see and taste. There is a parking garage but I always try and find street metered parking first.", "author": "Chuck D."}

The only time I do so is during the Cherry Blossom Festival Parade. The last time I attended the parade was four years ago. However, I made sure to attend the parade this year with my two sisters, being that this was the 51st Annual Cherry Blossom Festival. It was something for us to do on a beautiful (weather wise) Sunday. Besides, it was my younger sister's 63rd birthday and we celebrated the occasion at Crown & Crumpet Tea Stop Cafe.\n\nIt would have been easier for us to catch the 38 Muni to Japantown from Union Square, but we opted to walk from the Civic Center BART Station to our destination. It was a challenge, but the returned walk was a little further - we ended up at Westfield Shopping Center near the Powell Street BART Station.\n\nAs usual, Japantown was packed with parade spectators, tourists, food vendors, merchandise vendors, live musical entertainment on the Webster Street Stage. Darn, we missed the Big City Revue and Jest Jammin' bands. I love both those bands and they certainly can get the party going, as in \"get up and get down, get up out of your seat; get up and get down, get up and move your feet...\" (Song by the Dramatics).\n\nI couldn't pass up on BeeFy Co, a vendor selling Hello Kitty Warriors t-shirts. I already have a black one, but not a blue one. Quick - $25 out of my pocket. No regrets in making the purchase. The next stop was an origami exhibit on Post Street. My sisters and I did not stay long. Reason: It was packed with wall-to-wall people and I don't do well in an enclosed crowded area (indoor). I'm okay if the crowd is outdoor and I can breathe. \n\nOur final stop was Daiso. I picked up a few items for purchase, but when I saw the line of customers from the front of the store to the back, I told myself \"never mind\". I will return another time when Japantown is not crowded; preferably on a weekday where I can stop in at either Yasukochi's Sweet Shop for a slice of coffee crunch cake or a croissant from Anderson Bakery.", "author": "Carol C."}

Sadly, there isn't much to do here besides grabbing some food and seeing a few iconic architectures. The stores here are decorated in a humble but cute-sy manner, but like most of your Sanrio and Tokyo Central look -alikes, it's more for window shopping and light perusing as everything inside is pricy. There's a Pika Pika- photobooth store, a Manga Bookstore, and a Tony Moly -cute drugstore makeup where I picked up some Pokemon hand lotion as gifts. \n\nTheres also a cute Animal Crepe store called Belly Good and some Ramen eatery that garnered an okay rating so we ate elsewhere before coming. Check out the Japanaese mini tower too! Stationary and boutiques close around 5/6 so plan your visit accordingly\n\nIt's one of those one and done places in my honest opinion.

Then, there is the shops and restaurants in the interior section. Both of the spaces are very nicely designed and are inviting.\n\nJapantown has a great Japanese/English bookstore that features books and magazines that were published in Japan and books that feature and discuss Japanese culture. This is truly one of the mainstays of Japantown and I highly recommend you visit it because you will truly find unique publications.\n\nThere are also several shops that offer unique culturally orientated items and art. Simply by walking through the facility you can venture into these shops and find great gifts or those unique items that you never knew you needed.\n\nIn terms of the restaurants and/or caf\u00e9s, there are a number of them.

You could spend your lifetime looking for one, and it would not be a wasted life.\" - Katsumoto \n\nJapantown in San Francisco is the closest you'll get to Japan if you haven't been to Japan. It's by no means spectacular, but like Captain Algren (Tom Cruise) square-dancing with Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) it's the best North Hollywood version of Ginza District. And yes, I find comfort and why I've been here more times than I can remember. \n\nI've been to Japantown in San Francisco many times, and probably in many life times as well. The beauty of this Japantown is that some businesses have been here forever, like Benkyo-do which opened it's doors after the great earthquake of 1906, the award-winning mochi & confections is heaven to one's lips. Old businesses like Soko Hardware is still family owned and pre-dates the WWII era. Other \"from Japan\" businesses include, Kinokuniya Books, Daiso Japan, Sakura Sakura, Moritaya, etc., etc. Nijiya Market is located here too. Then you count the endless Japanese restaurants, bakeries, and omiyage shops. How about Katsura Gardens for all you aspiring green-thumb'rs! And to anchor Japantown you can find Sundance Kabuki Theaters, Kabuki Springs & Spa, and Hotel Kabuki. \n\nMy very first traditional tea ceremony was held at an old tea house on Osaka Way. Back when I took Japanese in college and my instructor invited a group of us. It certainly was an experience I'll never forget. For a moment I felt like Tom Cruise sipping tea with the dead Samurai's widow, but then I woke *snap* to find my dozen classmates staring at me. Mimi ni tako ga dekiru lol!\n\nThis Japantown is as Japanese as you can experience outside of Japan. I should know too, since I've been to Japan and can use the \"things Japanese\" philosophy as measurement. I admit Japantown, San Francisco is my semi-secret place to hang-out & zen. Eat a bowl of real Japanese noodles, or a handful of the most divine mochi. Sometimes you can find me browsing a book in Kinokuniya, or admiring a 19th century Hiroshige at the art gallery. Sometimes I'm incognito as the Last Samurai, under the 100-foot Peace Pagoda, a friendship gift from Osaka, Japan, sister city of San Francisco. Ah be humble, shoulders relaxed, no mind, no mind... my Bushid\u014d instructor once taught me. A warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does. Hai, Sensei!! \n\nTowards the end of the movie, it was only then, as Katsumoto lay dying, he looked up at the cherry blossoms above him that he realized... \"Perfect. They are all perfect...\" Perfection was everywhere.\n\nThe End. \n\n\"They are an intriguing people. From the moment they wake, they devote themselves to the perfection of whatever they pursue. I have never seen such discipline.\" - Algren, The Last Samurai", "author": "Eric R."}

The festival has been around for about 50 years. The live bands and cool food booths, offering both traditional and trendy Japanese food contribute to this lively, party-like outdoor venue.  \n\n Although I've attended this event many times in previous years, it's always fun to explore the various food stalls, and stroll through J-Town when it's totally packed.  Emphasis on totally packed. Think no parking to be found anywhere remotely nearby, along with jam packed restaurants.  It's actually an anomaly for J-Town.  When you visit on any non-festival day, I wouldn't describe it as even busy, and definitely not packed.  On a \"normal weekend\", there's a good amount of customer flow, but nothing that would make the news.  On the other hand, festival weekends are a completely different story. This was definitely a fun-filled, but also a crowd-filled weekend.  Having said that, we did arrive today on Sunday, in the middle of the closing parade, which is a huge attraction of the festival.  Again, just be ready to endure the kind of crowds you'll never encounter here on any other given day.  \n\nOf course, you'll always experience Japanese food galore here.  Endless sushi spots, ramen restaurants, etc.  Anything and all Japanese food related items can be found.  However, interestingly, given the vast amount of Japanese restaurants throughout the entire city of SF, most locals don't head to J-Town for Japanese food.  Perhaps because it's considered a tad touristy here?  Not sure, but none of my personal favorite Japanese restaurants, high or low end are in J-Town.  \n\nI've frequented SF J-Town countless number of times.  It's interesting if you've never been here, and I easily prefer it over the J-Town in San Jose.  You can easily spend half a day here, browsing the various shops, having a nice lunch, or you can extend your day with a stop at Pearl Spa, a women's Korean spa, which I totally loved (refer to my upcoming review for deets).  As a visitor, if you have some extra time to spare and enjoy Japanese culture, definitely make your way over to SF J-Town.  Or if you've never ever experienced their annual Cherry Blossom Festival, I'd say it's worth doing, at least once. Same time, next year.  Plus, all this fun is free too!", "author": "Lori N."}

Nijiya, Japanese Supermarket. \n\nSome of the higher end Sushi restaurants feature Japanese trained Chefs who wield their knives as expertly as they present comestibles steeped in Japanese culinary traditions.  \n\nWent on Sunday, August 27th where they conducted a Origami/Japanese paper folding contest to introduce Japanese culture & art to all who participated.

I missed out the weekend of CBF that I made sure I got some yesterday! Yay for selling individual slices!\n\nIt seems that they always are having events here on the weekend. We just so happened to come when they had Japan Day. They even provided shuttles to the Soy & Tofu event which was held close by not in Japantown but a trek away if you were to walk. \n\nCurrently the Hotel Kabuki is undergoing renovations but I think they are still opened to the public.

Should you drive here, there are two parking garages with discounted validation from many of the businesses.\n\nWhether it is grocery shopping in Nijiya and Super Mira supermarkets, shopping for cool nic nacks at Daiso, eating some mochi at Benkyodo, desserts at Sweet Stop or eating at one of the many restaurants that encompasses Japanese, Korean and Chinese cuisines, Japantown has something from everyone.", "author": "Al L."}

Located in the city you can find either street parking or the garages they offer.

I'm not here seasonally but rather cyclically. I return and I'm reminded what I've missed: Soko Hardware, Nijiya Market, Sundance Kabuki Theater, Peace Plaza and all the shops and restaurants in Japantown Center. \n\nJapantown is evergreen and since we drive past it constantly we tend to forget about its place (its beginning after WWII, an ugly chapter in U.S. history), its treasures and San Franciscan-ness. \n\nI wonder what it will be like once the Board of Supes decides to finally fill in the tunnel of Geary Boulevard so people really see and travel through Japantown by whatever means of car, foot or bike and not just whiz past it 60 feet below at 50 mph on their way east towards Union Square and the FiDi.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

So, I decided to search on Yelp and found out about this cool place! Coming all the way here from Downtown San Francisco, it was definitely very different. Around this area, I saw a lot more of the elder generation and school kids.\n\nAfter walking around for a bit, we saw a bridge and the five-tiered concrete Peace Pagoda. We knew we made it! Walking in, I don't think we were at a normal entrance, but it was kind of sketchy, because there was a paper sign that said take the stairs or the elevator. We were debating between the two options, when literally 10 massive flies were in the small space and then flew closer to the elevator where a mop was blocking it. Guess the elevator was the only option. Going into the mall felt like Pacific Mall in Toronto or Aberdeen Center in Vancouver. It wasn't nearly as big as either of them, but it reminded me of them because they had little stores and restaurants in a little section of the malls.\n\nThere was honestly SO much to eat, we couldn't decide, so we literally just walked around until we were so hungry that we just walked into a restaurant. HIGHLY recommend coming here to check out DAISO, everything is only $1.50 there! Loved it so much. JapanTown's \"malls\" are also not all connected, so there's a section that you have to walk outside before you reach the West/East Mall. We walked a little outside where the main entrance of Japan Town was as it had an arch. The shops outside are very cute as well, I loved the origami shop which also sold Tortoro backpacks. Outside on the sidewalks of this street, there were unique sections to sit in.\n\nDefinitely a cute little area in San Francisco. I wouldn't say it's completely Japanese though because I saw a lot of Korean stores in there as well!", "author": "Kristy N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-04", "description": "For most of my life, I've detested this place. Just boring and dull, like the rest of the city. Then I guess, I \"discovered,\" or maybe rediscovered, Japantown a few years ago. It's the only place in the city that's \"Asian,\" yet upscale and cool instead of ghetto. It's not that Japanese, except for the bookstore, Daiso/Ichi Ban Kan, some restaurants, and the festivals. I'd say it's more pan-Asian than anything else. Most of the businesses are owned by Chinese or Korean, probably. With the popularity of Korean beauty products, there are a few Korean beauty stores here now, but Tony Moly is so creepy it makes Sephora seem accessible in comparison. \n\nOverall, Japantown feels like an oddly comfortable part of the city, with much less hipster and elitist pretensions than most neighborhoods. You probably won't see rallies of the moment here, whether Occupy in 2011, or Bernie in 2015, or BLM in 2016. It feels comfortably Asian, like you can be yourself instead of trying to fit into SF pretensions. \n\nChinese places in the city tend to be painfully ghetto, like Chinatown, or almost working class, in an ugly way, like Irving, Noriega, Clement, etc. But Japantown is chic, clean, and cool. Japanese pop culture as well as traditional culture reign supreme here - one of the Asian cultures that has managed to be upscale and trendy, instead of ghetto in this city. \n\nThe festivals here have always annoyed me - too many people, anime/cosplay types that look godawful, politicians riding in cars, garish floats, and uninteresting food. I remember when Ross Mirkarimi was in a car in the parade, happily waving, as if he were free of the wife-beating scandal that made him infamous a number of years ago. A lot about SF is much worse than it's made out to be. I've always gotten a depressed feeling coming to the Cherry Blossom and other festivals in the area. \n\nKinokuniya Bookstore - the top level has lots of interesting stuff, all laid out in a clean, well-lighted way. It's actually a chain, which might come as a surprise to most people. Like all bookstores in SF, it has its own unique sort of selection. It's not renegade or edgy, but it does has a good amount of art and design books. It has none of the scary, uninviting vibe of many bookstores in the Bay Area. The bottom level, though, seems strictly for hardcore manga, anime, or Japanese pop art fans.  \n\nNijiya Market might be a decent place if you're really into Japanese food, grocery items, and toiletries. Otherwise, it's good for a new and novel sort of visit and not much else. I never found staff to be pleasant, in contrast to the \"nice and polite\" stereotype of Japanese people. \n\nNew People is like CAAMFest - full of Asian American hipster types who think they know a lot about film and cool culture. It seems the various stores here are always changing, probably due to high rent, lack of business, and overpriced, niche merchandise. I'm not sure how much the New People stores and offerings \"represent\" Japan. I'm sure Japantown represents Japan as little as Chinatown represents China. Which is 0%.", "author": "Valle H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-27", "description": "So, I'm going to give this a solid three stars. At this point, I dream for one big thing regarding this location in San Francisco: For there to be more Japanese ambiance here - and I don't mean cutesy-cutesy stuff, or stuff that is simply \"good for the kids\" - no, I mean a good Japanese vibe that goes on within the City. Upon going here as a teen, Kinokuniya was and still is a great store and my favorite. I'll tell one at the moment, it's a big part makes Japantown as good as it is. So yesterday was the second time I've been here just in the last month, and my takeaways are that there a bunch of good places to just hang out both outside and inside of what I'll call the \"Kinokuniya Property\" - due to the mall being named after the bookstore; there are plenty of places to eat, but my personal favorite, although it is available in other locations, is Benihana: I love that place and everything about it as long as I'm next to the hibachi grill. Daiso is a great nic-nac store, but I like the one next to the Powell Street BART better.\n\nNow that was just some of the good about Japantown, so here are some of the not-so-good stuff that I can recall about it in my head: Although there are lots of restaurants, much of Japantown is consisted of restaurants that sell similar offerings - it's literally like a \"who does it better\" kind of thing from what I can tell. I know though, that there are some confectionary stores within the mall, but the thing is, I don't eat foods with added sugar, and for those who thoroughly care about what they put into their bodies like I do, there aren't many options. With that said, there isn't much of a variety in regards to restaurants. Also, the nic-nac stores aren't exactly the most practical things in the world; although you can find a few hidden gems within those stores, so it isn't a total red flag. But one thing about Japantown that is very much a red flag these days is Japan Video. I wrote a review about it if one is curious, and I'm very annoyed and disappointed with that store at this day and age.\n\nSome more good things about Japantown though are that it designates a spot so you can get food or something from a different place delivered while you're hanging out over there. Also, I noticed that if you're walking here all the way from one of the BART stations, all of the sudden, around the time you hit Cathedral Hill (like say if you're walking from Powell St.) You might notice the sudden decrease in the angry beggars and the rest of those loonies that you'd see on Geary and O'Farrell. I don't know if they're chased out of there, but I must say, \"Keep it up\" when it comes to not having creeps surrounding the Japantown mall. I also hear that the grocery stores and the bars seem decent from what I hear, and I've got a good vibe about 'em, but I haven't been in them as of yet. I would like to visit Japantown again in a few weeks, or even sooner, but that Japanese ambiance.. it is very much missing: I heard that there were once \"old time\" Japanese stores from reviews. In addition, I remember there being cool places like that as well as video game import shops, but I know, these \"beauty places\" and nic-nac stores being the only places here in Japantown aside from Kinokuniya, isn't cutting it, and most certainly isn't for everyone. Until then, I'll go to just Kinokuniya and perhaps a Japanese restaurant, or something slightly different located in other parts of the City, or Oakland, Emeryville, or Berkeley. I'm glad I know Japanese well enough to purchase and read the books, and hold convos, but that's just me. Maybe I'll also see if there's anything else good going on in Japantown, but until then, Peace folks.", "author": "John S."}

Not to mention how As I was walking outI saw him drop trash into the bag then out of the same bag filled with trash pull out seat covers?! So gross. It's a shame because it's a nice place to shop and eat, and I'm so happy they try and clean the bathrooms but the way they do it is just wrong.", "author": "Katie B."}

It is a 6-block area in SF and is well worth visiting if you have any love for Japanese food or shopping. I have much love for both of these things so I've made three trips to Japantown so far. The first time I walked there from SOMA but I would recommend a taxi unless you're staying close (I always think distances in SF look quite small and am completely wrong every time). \n\nI've never eaten at one of the restaurants in Japantown (horror) but have had crepes which were pretty good. The area is a shopping centre split over two halves - one of which is mainly a Daiso (100 Yen store / $1.50). Daiso is good but the one upstairs is better. \n\nOn the other side of the shopping centre there's more shops and restaurants. My picks are the Kinokuniya bookstore and Maido for stationery, and there are some really sweet gift shops too. Definitely pay the area a visit - this is where I got most of my gifts/presents for myself to take back home.", "author": "Briony C."}

No Crayon Sinchan or doraemon characters, FF characters such as squall, lightning figurine or a cute danbo. Very dissapointed. \n\nWalked into Daiso Japanese store like a dollar store but nothing fun, it was only stuff that we are not gonna use ( note maybe for some teenagers who like some cute /  Kawa\u012bdesu / kawaii girly stuff ) \nSo ended with buy nothing from this store. \n\nIt seems wherever we went, we got bad looks from some older Japanese women, note only from the older women not the young people. \nOh yes the prejudice eyes and manner. \nI am not a racist but geez cmon this is America. I knew it since they do the prejudice with their own race too if the people are born mix race not pure Japanese. Not believe me? Just watched the movie about it. \n\nWow ladies really? First of all I'm not a Japanese and second y'all now live in USA a country with a freedom so please get rid off your mind set from your origin country.  \n\nActually, there's not much here to enjoy here, little boring. There were few of restaurant choices. \nWe picked one and a dissapoinment.  \nWe thought what better place to get a tea than in japantown but what a dissapoinment  The best that I can say it was mediocre. No mochi shop inside the building only outside which wasn't that good and bad service seemed like they didn't want to serve us. \n\nThe only highlight of the adventure was the Japanese market. Everything of Japanese that you can think. So I bought many Japanese snacks such as kitkat that you baked in the oven, green tea and dark chocolate kitkat & and some instant ramen.\n\nAnd the kinokuniya book store hmm disappointed. This book store was my fav place to go every weekend while I lived in my original country so I was excited to find out what they'll have in real japantown and real Japanese book store but nada.

It's definitely one of the more popular tourist attractions here in SF. There is a shopping center on each side of the tower (not sure what that's actually called). There are quite a few shops, but I usually just window shop and sightsee. Those shops include your typical Daiso, several small Japanese/Anime shops, a few bookstores, clothing stores, food stands/shops, and some restaurants. Most of these places are pretty affordable in my opinion. Some may be cheaper than others. But since this is a tourist attraction, there are some places that could be a little more expensive. \n\nThere are also a supermarket down the street and several restaurants and shops around the area (like across the street). I honestly only come here for one thing and that's food. I come here for the Belly Good Crepes that is located in one of the indoor mall area. To me, there aren't very much to do around here. People walk around, take some pictures, and eat mostly. \n\nOverall, I do recommend coming here if you haven't yet! It's a nice place in the area even if you're a native.

There are plenty of shopping experience to explore, endless restaurants in both East/West malls including nearby areas outside within .5 mile radius, and an outdoor ginormous courtyard with a pagoda to bask in all that year round weather in San Francisco (no snow for my Minnesota friends). \n\nDaiso Japan I was told opened a few years ago where tourists gets a sample of \"Japan!\"  They sell pretty much everything you can think off other than grocery items.  Their pricing starts at $1.50 on up.  Cheap for a huge ceramic soup bowl.\n\nThere is a parking garage underneath which also connects directly to the Hotel Kabuki for that added convenience including direct access to the both malls.  If you stay here, you must try their Hot Spring Spa!!  It will do wonders!!\n\nIn addition, one of their annual highlights is the Cherry Blossom Festival (around April/May) and said to be \"the second largest festival outside of Washington, D.C. to celebrate the blooming of cherry blossoms.\"  I was told buy one of the participants, this year's event included one of the largest \"Anime\" homemade costume celebration.\n\nIf you are looking for that one of kind Kimono, you will find it here but for the added tourist cost.  I suggest walking several blocks away doing business with the locals as it  will reduce your cost significantly up to 50% or more!  I did buy a Samurai sword here awhile back only because the owner was retiring and was selling his business.  He gave me a great deal I couldn't pass up! :p  So do ask for added discounts if you are here to shop.\n\nFor the coffee lovers (like me),  Andersen Bakery is also located inside this mall.  A treat after having enjoyed those delicious sushi from \"Isobube\" across the hall.  And I save the best for last ---- for the Karaoke lovers and party goers, there are several Korean BBQ restaurants outside this mall with  private rooms where you can belch to your hearts desire and be a \"mega-star\" for your friends and families and have a nice sit down dinner too.  \n\nJust so you know -- I am that one in a million Filipino Dude that CAN'T carry a tune.

Instead, the stores all carried various imported traditional Japanese merchandise - a few highlights: Vintage (aka \"gently pre-owned\") Happi Coats at Asakichi for about 30 bucks each, which is what they charge in Asakusa, Japan! Quite the bargain! Playland Japan with all of the funky Japanese arcade games to play. And of course, Daiso Japan! Such a score and brings back great memories. Just like the 100 Yen stores all over Tokyo, except here maybe 150 Yen (aka, most items about $1.50), but still great stuff on the cheap!

It mirrors Little Tokyo in LA, but is much bigger and older than Sho-Tokyo. \n\nThe area is like a rectangle, with the following streets surrounding that section - Sutter St to the North, Geary Blvd to the South, Fillmore St to the West, and Laguna St to the East. Webster St cuts thru the center from North to South and Post St goes thru the middle from West to East.\n\nVisiting Japantown is a must for me when visiting the Golden Gate City. It's quiet, relaxing, and there's tons of stuff to see and shop. Not to mention all the good eats and restaurants nearby. The Peace Pagoda is quite a sight. It's a five tiered concrete Buddhist stupa. It's a part of the Japan Center complex, designed by Japanese architect Yoshiro Taniguchi and presented to San Francisco by the people of Osaka, Japan.\n\nJapan Center is the main shopping plaza in Japantown. Opened in 1968, it's composed of three malls - the Kinokuniya Mall, Kintetsu Mall, and Miyako Mall. The two major festivals held each year in J Town are the Cherry Blossom Festival (April) and the Nihonmachi Street Fair (August).\n\nWhat I also like about this place is that there's some Chinese and Korean influence within the surrounding area. It's not just about Japanese culture, with Little Tokyo in LA having that same attitude. A good mix of Asian diversity.

Be careful with the prices because sometimes is not that cheap and here you can get excited easily, but here you'll see the most funny chop-sticks ever, get them!\n\nI'd refurbish some old parts of the store that doesn't fit very much with the clean, colorful Japanese style.", "author": "Mar\u00eda Q."}

There are some awesome things around here (the 21+ Kabuki 8, Kabuki Springs, Mums), but the mall itself feels...like a mall. Lots of inauthentic food shops, overpriced tchotchkes and more -- they even have a Benihana's for chrissake!\n\nIf you know what you want, Japantown's worth it.", "author": "Casey S."}

A wealthy amount of novelty shops, a good collection of specialty stores, and a delicious shindig of traditional Asian restaurants. \n\nIt's a good get-away from the norms of the city. The atmosphere here is humble, yet lively and rich in culture. They even have dances going on at their tiny square by the man-made pond. I don't know how regular it is, but I've been lucky enough to catch it on the weekends.

The original Peace Pagodas were built in Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the atomic bomb attacks in WWII.  Now many of them have been built in cities and countries in Asia, Europe and America to signify and to promote World peace.\n\nOn the south side (the side near Geary) are the 3 main buildings: The East, West and Kinokuniya Malls, which are connected in the upper level.  This is really nice on a cold and rainy day where you can park in the garage and explore all 3 buildings without venturing outside.\n\nDining:  You'll find eateries of all sizes and flavors - from Benihana to small bakeries, from sushi to ramen, from seafood to steaks.  There are also several small coffee houses as well as a few crepe shops, where local gems are often found.  I highly recommend Sophie's Crepe. Too bad we ate so much already and we couldn't sample every store.\n\nShopping:  The 2 main anchors are Daiso and Kinokuniya Bookstore.  This Kinokuniya is large, almost the size of a Barnes and Nobles.  There are many small boutique stores selling everything from fashions to dvd's and souvenirs.  You have plenty of opportunities to purchase numerous items that embrace the Japanese culture.  There's also a grocery store at the corner of Post and Webster (the far west end of the complex).\n\nAcross the street on the North side is an outdoor pedestrian complex separated in the middle by Osaka Way, a stony walkway which looks like a replica of the streets of Japan.  The pathway is lined by more shopping and dining establishments as well as a small multi-level fashion complex.  There is also a large home furnishing store.\n\nParking:  There are both street metered parking as well as garage parking.  Before you complain that it is expensive, don't forget that you are in San Francisco.", "author": "Rob L."}

After 1906, San Francisco's main Japantown was in the Western Addition, with a smaller one in the South Park area. By World War II, the neighborhood was one of the largest such enclaves of Japanese outside of Japan.\n\nAfter the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the neighborhood experienced \"Pogroms\" or violent attacks on residences and businesses. In February 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt signed Executive Order 9066 that forced all Japanese of birth or descent in the United States interned. By 1943 many large sections of the neighborhood remained vacant due to the forced internment. The void was quickly filled by thousands of African Americans who had left the South to find wartime industrial jobs in California as part of the Great Migration. \n\nFollowing the war, some Japanese Americans returned, along with new Japanese immigrants and associated investment. However, many did not return to the neighbourhood and instead settled in other parts of the city or out to the suburbs. This was further exacerbated by the city's efforts to rejuvenate the neighborhood initiated by Justin Herman in the Western Addition in the 1960s through the 1980s. In my opinion, the result is a concrete ethnic enclave that has may of the expected trappings, but lacks a certain unifying energy or soul. Even the remains of Manzanar in the Eastern Sierras or the Oregon Nikkei Legacy Center area (including the Memorial Garden) in Old Town Portland offers more spirit or Ruach. \n\nThe area is home to Japanese (and some Korean and Chinese) restaurants, supermarkets, indoor shopping malls, hotels, banks and other shops, including one of the few U.S. branches of the large Kinokuniya bookstore chain. Most of these businesses are located in the commercial center of the neighborhood which is a large shopping mall built in the 1960s as part of an uninspiring urban renewal effort. I still enjoy coming here, but wish there was more continuity that would encourage me to linger.....", "author": "Eric B."}

This is a much better Japantown than San Jose's, which is smaller and not as bustling. SF Japantown is the place to be.\n\nSome of my favorites here:\n- Daiso -- the Japanese $1.50-and-up store (always a long line!)\n- There's another $1.50+ store inside the mall upstairs that isn't quite as big but isn't as crowded if you're claustrophobic\n- Sophie's Crepes -- THE BEST CREPES EVER.\n- Tanpopo -- pretty good ramen\n- Nijiya -- Japanese market (pretty cramped, but gots the goods)\n- Kinokuniya -- Japanese chain bookstore\n\nWhere else is it acceptable to dress up as anime characters for no reason?", "author": "Esther Y."}

Most of the restaurants are owned and run by non-Japanese people, and the food is very mediocre or bad across the board. If I want to eat good Japanese food, I definitely do not go here: I've been disappointed time and again. Although this area could be such a great resource, it is such a shame that the quality of the restaurants is so poor. I left some stars for the fact that there is a kinokuniya and that some of the art/tea/household item shops are OK, though expensive.

Impossible street parking, but there is an adjacent garage. If you're expecting something like lively Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, you'll be totally disappointed by dull Japantown in San Francisco. It has zero Japanese ambience.", "author": "Pam J."}

My boyfriend and I spent a long weekend here recently, in town solely to eat at some of the best places the city has to offer.  We rented a car, but only used it once to visit friends in Livermore. With the Hotel Tomo as our choice of lodging for three nights, we hoofed it around the city from there, trying to offset all the calories we were consuming on our weekend of eating.  Our location was perfect as there are several great restaurants and bakeries only a few blocks in either direction as well as right across the street.  Most of the other destinations were only an average of 2 miles away on foot (Chinatown, Mission district, the Ferry Building).  The gym that we're members of was only half a mile away.  We went to mass at St. Dominic's, which was two blocks down the street. We went to the movies at an AMC that was less than a mile away.  Cronuts at Fillmore Bakeshop was two blocks away. Millionaire's Bacon was had at Sweet Maple around the corner.  You get the picture.  I think the furthest we walked was to get ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery, almost three miles away.  But, we lucked out with wonderful weather and never saw fog once.  What's nice about Japantown is that it's quiet and laid-back.  I've stayed in Union Square as well as near the Embarcadero and those locations have their advantages, too, but J-Town is just your nice, friendly neighborhood with not a lot of people, noise, or traffic.  Consider it if you're planning a trip and don't mind walking around the city; it's the best way to experience it, IMHO.", "author": "Terri C."}

Japantown hasn't had this many empty stores since 2006. I seriously hope that they find new tenants to fill those spaces. Most of the stores that closed, were places that I regularly shopped. Including a Sanrio store with an amazing Badtz Maru collection. And, a clothing and toy store, where I got all of my cool Anime shirts. The more stores that close, the less that people are going to want to patronize the mall. Most of the stuff that you can buy in Japantown is much cheaper on Amazon, but I like paying a little extra for the experience, and to make a memory. Window shoppers, and people watchers will get a kick out of this place. If you are a 3DS owner, this is a great place for street passes. I always see 3 or 4 people hanging out, and playing games.

I am a bit of a Japanophile, having lived there a while. I was stoked to visit this place, but... yeah, I didn't care for it. There is a large San Rio store some people may like, but there isn't even much of a market to speak of. Only ate at one restaurant, and it was awful. Even the Daiso, which is much like a \"hundred yen store\" in Japan, isn't very good. Don't go there thinking you'll get to practice Japanese language skills either because most people are tourists speaking English or Chinese. I guess actual Nihonjin know of better places to be. \n\nOne last remark if anyone happens to be San Diegan or visiting there... check out the several Japanese markets around Kearny Mesa neighborhood.

After my weekly piano lessons at the conservatory, we would always make the habitual stop here to stock up on food supplies, new books at Kinokuniya for my mum and manga for my little sister and myself, and the family dinner of udon and nabeyaki at Mifune.\n\nAs a child, nothing is boring.  Everything is new and fresh, especially since I remember pressing my hands against the glass display to look at the colorful and fruit decorated cakes at Marie Antoinette.  Or running through the Sanrio store with handfuls of their pretty pink pens: Hello Kitty characters perched on top, holding on for dear life.  Or the Batzmaru stuffed doll, brooding (it is currently sitting on top of my computer screen) reminding me of bad Mondays.  Most of those trinkets built from childhood fancies have found their way into goody bags for local charities and Children's homes now.  As I have gotten older, it has been thrown into the bag labeled Galakuta, or just a bunch of things gathering dust and taking up space.\n\nMifune is still there, a concrete nod to the past, with their hot udon dishes.  Benihana is also there, catering to the tourists with chefs brandishing flourishes of their knives and grilling skills (never mind the shrimp that landed in my lap once for humor).  Sapporo-Ya, tucked in the corner across from Kinokuniya is also aging well with their ramen and yakisoba dishes, despite our retraction of patronizing the place after a rude waiter demanded that we leave tip (Native Japanese don't leave tip) so it was a wrong assumption on his part.\n\nMost of the other stores have faded out, as ownership of this mall has changed hands.  The outside pond that use to store treasured Koi fish was filled in with concrete due to vandalism and theft (how low can some people get) and the pagoda a sad remnant of the vigorous and prosperous 80's for the Japanese electronics boom, and now, a lone standing monument casting a long shadow across the vacant courtyard, where large pillars once stood guard, now removed.  \n\nBut as I walked along the cobble stoned area between the mall, I realized that Japantown was and will always be that small yet happy memories of my childhood: spent with family, spent as a child, playing hide-n-seek between the supporting legs of the pagoda.\n\nA must for all visitors and tourists.

I agree with Helene K that there's something not right here.\n\nLet me clarify.  I think it's pretty cool that SF has one of the 3 remaining Japantowns in the US, but to me it doesn't really capture the essence of Japan.  They have a bunch of restaurants that serve Japanese food.  (Not all good, though to their credit, the restaurants that are bad are actually bad because they're mediocre Japanese food, they're not bad because they're Americanized Japanese food, except Benihana.)  There's a few stores that serve miscellaneous Japanese doo-dads, and a few grocery stores.\n\nThere is one bookstore.  Granted, it's a good one, in fact, Kinokuniya is your one-stop shop for J-Lit. (Is that a term?)  Too bad the US branches of this do not feel like the Japanese stores, they feel like an American retailer that sells Japanese books.  Whatever.  Beggars can't be choosers...or maybe they can.  Book Off, please come to SF!!!\n\nThe grocery store triumvirate of Nijiya, Super Mira, and Uoki K. Sakai closes too early and is too expensive and does not hold fun special food tastings.\n\nAnd finally, the blockage of Starbucks that was supposed to be built on the 1600 Post building was ridiculous.  Japan was Starbucks's first overseas market and now it's ingrained in their culture.  But no, Japantown wouldn't have that and insisted that an empty storefront is so much better. :rolls eyes:\n\nI shouldn't even get started about the mall, but here I go.  That's one of the ugliest, most hideous malls I've ever seen.  3 buildings, two of them are on stilts and are connected by some sort of walkway, the other one's...not connected.  wtf.\n\nMaybe we're just jaded in SF because we have Chinatown, and Japantown is not to Japan what Chinatown is to China.\n\nOr maybe I'm just jaded because I was expecting a slice of Tokyo (or at least Osaka), meaning a bustling centre and a tall buildings all lit up and Karaoke on every floor. (The only Karaoke bars here seem to be Korean! Nothing against Korea, but wtf) In Japantown SF on the other hand we get signs on buildings that say \"2F\".  That's all fine and dandy, but where's the remaining 6+F??  And everything here closes way too early.  The CD and bookstores in Japan are largely open til midnight.  Or at least past 8.  In Japantown every non-restaurant is closed by 8 (or earlier).  The restaurants, with a few exceptions, close at 9 so they're not that much better.\n\nThere are a few things about this place that are truly cool though.\n\nThe big death ray-like pagoda structure in Peace Plaza, especially at night.\n\nThe kanji, hirakana, and katakana on most of the buildings.\n\nThe restaurants, bad or not, which serve mostly homestyle (meaning non-sushi) Japanese food at good prices.\n\nThe restaurant clusterfuck in the middle of the mall, which does resemble what you might find in the Tokyo underground.", "author": "David A."}

I can't speak for the food, but the atmosphere was all wrong.\n\nEven though it's Japantown I think I heard all of 2 couples speaking Japanese while walking around. Everyone was either Korean or a weaboo.\n\nSpeaking of weaboo, Minus 10 billion stars for the group of weaboos hanging on the benches outside a crepe shop complete with hair dyed pink, CAT EARS and HOBBIT EARS (on different overweight chicks..) and other nerd cosplay accoutrements. Don't get me wrong, I like cosplay- when done right, in Japan, at conventions. I like Akihabara maids, and the girls who dress as lolitas and take the train dressed that way. It's just that they're actually in Japan, and they're actually Japanese, so they can do that. I think if I'd come closer to this group I would have heard a lot of \"OMG THAT'S SO KAWAII!!!\" and \"DESU DESU DESU\". \n\nOf course, all the shops cater to that kind of person....lots of fake kimonos, lucky cats, and other similar goodies for those taking Japanese 101 at the community college.\n\nThe only two redeeming stores: the purikura shop with authentic machines, and the Rilakkuma shop. The crepe shop was tempting but when I walked by and saw other people's crepes, it was clear by the thin, soft texture that these were French-style crepes, not the thicker, crunchier Japanese style crepe that is actually made for holding pudding, ice cream, cheesecake, or whatever else you can fit in there. These thin crepes were bursting all over the place. Not appetizing.\n\nIt seems like Japantown has a lot of history...I liked the monuments outside. But what is leftover of the mall are a bunch of souvenir shops for the anime loving dorks who think they should go live in Japan because \"no one understands them\" here. Desu.\n\nTo anyone who says the shops here are authentic: just, no.\n\nAlso, props to the Asian guy in the video rental shop who didn't understand when I requested a title in Japanese. I've never had issues at video stores in Japan so I'm pretty sure the problem was with him. Extra points for saying they only carry movies with subtitles. Are we sure Japantown caters to Japanese? Video rental shops in Japanese ares in the L.A. area *never* have subtitles. Why would I want them? If I'm renting a Japanese movie then it's because I want to see it in Japanese.

While we were there we saw a few groups of guys pull up in cars, run and take a picture of themselves here and then ran back to the car and take off. It was a scavenger hunt. How fun!\n\nI also love the Miyako mall with all its cute stores and restaurants. It's a very walkable neighborhood and from now on I'll be visiting Japantown during every visit to SF and enjoying  a meal at one of the many restaurants here!", "author": "Lori K."}

Japantown has been the same mostly on the inside and all of the outside.  Parking is limited.  San Francisco rarely gets hot weather.  When it gets hot, Japantown gets hotter.\n\nMy favorite areas in Japantown are the Kinokuniya bookstore and Peace Plaza where the pagoda is located.  Peace Plaza has cherry blossoms trees and an open area to be at peace.\n\nJapantown is worth about an hour visit as a tourist attraction.

Believe it or not but the development across Geary Blvd and further was all considered Japantown before Geary Blvd snaked through. Sigh. Kinda depressing. I understand this neighborhood is trying to stay alive and thrive off of what they can possible call their best but it's so hard. It's so hard to have a sense of community but there is hope. Cherry Blossom wasn't going to happen if there wasn't a fundraiser put on by my best friend's brother and his crew. Our younger generation who still appreciate our heritage is still trying their best to keep this neighborhood as a community and as a whole. But Michelle A does have a point that it's definitely losing it's authenticity. Some shops are owned by Chinese or Korean mom and pops, some things are getting way overpriced such as some of the food (I do not trust Mifune and their food... it used to be good when I was younger but now it just SUCKS). I know that a lot of stores have overpriced commodities but realize that they are trying to give their costumers the best they can offer when it comes to representing the Japanese. \n\nI used to play basketball all the time at the JCCCNC for league and tournaments which I'm sure they still do. I love coming to Cherry Blossom and Street Fair to see and taste the local fair and see ol' faces like a mini high school reunion ha. But lately these festivals have been struggling inside and out. \n\nJapantown is one of those at risk neighborhoods in the city that plays a part in the unique diversity of the city. We need to love and support it like it's one of our childhood toys that we want to treasure and cherish for the rest of our lives. Our American-Japanese community is trying their best, why not the rest of the city of SF? With the help of New People and newer development coming in, hopefully Japantown will revive and become a neighborhood everyone will be really, really excited about.", "author": "Marie G."}

A common initial impression by people that has lived in Japan is that J-Town has very little resemblance of shops, restaurants, and department stores in Japan.  Shops, especially in urban cities like Tokyo or Osaka, are cleaner, organized, and \"nice.\"  Many aging stores in J-Town are outdated and disorganized.  80% of the restaurants that serve mediocre food at J-Town would never survive in Tokyo where competition for quality food is fierce.  This was the view I had, until I started to look beyond the aging surface and realized that if I go there every other week, there must be positive qualities to the place.  After spending half a day looking at the stores with this new perspective, I realized that there are many unique shops and restaurants that everyone, regardless of your level of exposure to Japanese culture, should come and experience.  There are many \"gems\" hidden between mediocre restaurants.  I will create a \"list\" in Yelp to showcase some of these gems.  I still do believe in my theory that continuous revenue from tourists hurt Japantown as it keeps bad restaurants in business and doesn't motivate them to improve the quality of food.  Japanese tourists who cannot eat American food beyond two straight days rush to Japantown.  It's on their \"How to walk around the Earth\" guide book and they don't know about the \"good\" Japanese food in other parts of the town.  It doesn't matter anyways, because by this time, they are so desperate for miso soup and rice, tears start appearing in their eyes no matter what quality Japanese food they eat.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

It is the only senior lunch place in SF where seniors can sit down at a table, get a hot cup of tea, and be waited on for their Asian-style meal. I think lunch is only $1.50 so the line starts early, especially on unagi days. It might be worth your while  to comandeer a senior and check out lunch at Kimochi! \n\nNear the corner of Sutter and Buchannon is the National Japanese American Historical Society, another place I used to work at but before they moved here. Go in and check out their rotating exhibits. If you are doing research on any aspect of JA history, they have an archive you can request to use. Their photographic collection is amazing.  They also have oral histories. Fascinating stuff that most Americans have no idea about, especially during the WWII period.", "author": "Kara P."}

I am constantly in search of pre-packaged Onigiri, which I am told I can find here, and still haven't. \n\nAnyway, my cousin was visiting from Texas (how many reviews have I mentioned Texas in so far? Anyone counting?) and yesterday was her last day here. We decided, on a whim, to go play in the photo booth in the mall around 8:30 PM. Thankfully, although the stores were closed, the mall doors were still open to restaurant patrons (and photo booth nerds like us) and we wandered the halls until we found them. In case you're wondering, they're downstairs from Sophies Crepes.\n\nI was in Japan in 2003, and walking through this mall and seeing all the restaurants with their window displays and curtained doorways really reminded me of my experience there. Ironically, the mall did not remind me of the malls in Japan, but the little side streets lined with eateries and shops. \n\nOk, the photo booth. Let me just say....amazing! Confusing, but amazing. It's not one of the sit on a stool with a blue curtain behind you and get a strip of four shots kind of booths. No. This one lets you take 6 photos, 2 at a time, with little breaks in between. It lets you choose the color balance (our choice was 'beautiful skin'), it's super roomy, there are about 5 backgrounds to choose from, and then, at the end you choose your favorite four and add cutesy hello kitty borders to them, and THEN the machine prints them out in your choice of print styles and it prints them in such a way that everyone in the picture can get copies of all the shots.

My father-in-law wants to buy a condo and retire there. My mother-in-law can't stop talking about this place. So of course on my first visit to San Francisco I could not possibly go without visiting Japantown. I was a little skeptical but, as soon as I stepped out of the car I smelled home. We eat a lot of traditiona Japanese food at home and it was such a wonderful, comforting smell. Everything in this place is authentic. It really is a wonderful place to visit if you are interested in Japanese food or culture. It was convenient for us too because we were able to pick up some zarusoba and sembe for my children, who are very picky eaters but, love Japanese food.", "author": "Ellie S."}

The shopkeepers are around, but where are all the people?  Japantown has some perks, including a great Japanese bookstore (Kinokuniya), inexpensive but decent eats (ex: Mifune), and Ichiban Kan, land of cheapie cutsey home goods and things you never knew you needed -- but for the most part it's a isolated little strip that's really meant for tourists who'd be better off getting a taste of real \"Asian\" style by heading to SF's thriving Chinatown instead.", "author": "Andrea L."}

But recently the security detail has been lets say more overzealous in there duties there. Not to say we don't need security there, but the security company in Japantown has recently hired some young thugs that patrol the center like the Nazi youth. One of these little punks by the name of  Alan actually harassed me for carrying (yes, carrying.) my dog into the center, and I was only going to the garage. Another one of these youngsters patrols the garage  like a regular policeman even though he obviously isn't, and I've witnessed him harassing regular people in the garage who he thinks might be lingering too long. I can give more examples, but its one of the small changes in Japantown that I've seen that I don't like. If one of these brown uniformed punks  messes with me with their gestapo tactics again, I'll definitely take them to the courthouse. Patrons beware when you deal with these guys.", "author": "Andrew D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-19", "description": "I love Japantown in San Francisco. It is much bigger and has more shops than the one in San Jose for obvious reason. It reminds me of Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, but I think this is much better 'cause it seems more modern. Lots of Japanese restaurants and other types of restaurants, and it seems that the prices are not too pricey. They are typical of most Japanese restaurants I have been to. I did not go to one, but definitely if I were going out on a date, this would be on top of my list. And the shops, they definitely make you feel like you are in Japan. And definitely the experience won't be complete without going to place called New People. Check out my review about it. So since I am more than a fan, I will definitely give this a five star rating. I will definitely come here a lot whenever I get a chance. Yes, some place are pretty pricey, but I am sure you go to Japan, it is probably pricier (in addition, you gotta pay for a plane ticket plus your hotel). :)", "author": "Christopher R."}

(can't remember name, sorry) immediatly we all errupted into a fit of giggles. it was the funniest thing! there are about 6 or 7 japanese photo booths.(if you see them you'll know why its so funny) we chose one and started posing for pictures with weird backgrounds. afterwards we realized the instructions were all in japanese so it took forever to understand how to get our pics out.... but somehow we managed. before we left, i tried to steer everyone into that great little karaoke bar for some singing, but i was overruled. damn. next time i sing! next time for sure.", "author": "Michelle I."}
