The thin velvety skin, the flavorful pork and shrimp filling, the bouncy chewy noodles with the light but soothing broth...I cannot stand \"American Style\" won ton with tick and doughty skin! \n\nCongee:\nGreat consistency. I order their Fish Congee and it is delicate and flaky without any funky aroma.\n\nService:\nI don't know what everyone else is talking about! They are friendly, efficient and courteous.

I think \"authentic\" is a reach for this place.

There were only 3pcs of Wonton, but they were large. The noodles were a bit too hard. They just dropped a few pieces of iceberg lettuce in there without even slicing it up or separating them. \n\nWe ordered one of the steamed rice pots (beef and egg) and it was SAD! The rice wasn't flavored, they just gave us a bowl of sauce to pour in. Looks like they just scooped white rice in the pot and served the sliced meat on top of it. They even forgot the fried egg and just gave it to us a on a small plate. \n\nThe rice noodles were good. Very fresh and well flavored. \n\nThe iced milk tea was too sweet and the iced coffee tasted watered down. \n\nReally disappointed, not sure if I would go back.

One of the waitresses came to look at the line and the names on the waiting list at least 3 times, but failed to seat anyone in line, or even acknowledge the presence of the customers. Instead, she slowly walked away, then around the restaurant slowly looking for other tasks to do, completely ignoring the line. Customers were left standing there looking awkwardly at each other and confused about what had just happened. \n\nWe were finally seated only after a customer flagged down another waitress to ask about why the line was being held up. \n\nWe've been here several times before and experienced their painfully slow service.

My bad. Tak Kee Lee is to the left of TJ Cups, oops.\n\nWe decided to eat here anyways, and I ordered the set B combo (shrimp wonton noodles+bbq pork cheung fun+free hot beverage) for $9.95+tax. The noodles come with three wontons and I was a little disappointed at first because usually wonton noodles come with 6 wontons, but these wontons are LOADED with shrimp. One of these equals two basically. The soup was okay, I can taste white pepper powder and drinking the soup made me thirsty. The noodles were a bit thinner than other egg noodles that I've had before.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-18", "description": "Why is Ming Tai Wun-Tun perfect for SF?\n1) The weather is nearly always appropriate for a steamy bowl of wonton noodles.\n2) Everywhere else in the city is $$$... It is no exaggeration that a meal at Ming Tai costs about the same as an appetizer in trendy places.\n3) Because HK native aka me approves.\n\nAs the name implies, Ming Tai's most popular item is their wonton, though they do have a good selection of other eats ranging from congee to Chinese donuts. They also have combos of a main dish, a side dish, and a hot drink.\n\nI highly recommend the heavenly wontons. The filling is meaty with generous portions of shrimp and pork, and the thin skin is cloud-like--true to word origins of \u96f2\u541e meaning cloud-like dumplings. Devouring the wontons whole give the same satisfaction as eating sushi in one bite. Note that there are several options for wonton dishes: the basic wonton noodle soup, the wontons only (for low-carb noodle-phobes, I guess), or the wonton lo mein (\u6488\u9eb5) which consists of noodles with soup on the side (similar to tsukemen, good if you don't want your noodles to get soggy). The broth was satisfying and flavorful, though I would have liked the noodles more al dente. In traditional standards, the noodles should be \"bouncing off the teeth\", and it had a ways to go. \n\nAnother commonly ordered item, the Chinese donut rice noodle roll (\u70b8\u5169), is Canto comfort food. The combination of crispy golden fried dough, attenuated by the rice noodle skin, and augmented with the peanut sauce and sesame seeds, is addicting no matter how hodgepodge-y the idea may seem. The dough was a tad too dry, but I liked how it wasn't greasy. Mmm... Chinese donuts :3\n\nAlthough the chicken mushroom clay pot rice is a road-less-traveled dish here, it turned out legit and quite satisfying. The chicken itself is decent, and the rice is on point--baked to a mild crisp and very umami in soaking up all the chicken flavor. The steel pot they use is non-traditional and you don't get the magical burnt crispy rice at the bottom. I guess it's also healthier that it entails less oil, and that steel is technically more sanitary (...though I really doubt anyone else cares besides me). \n\nAnd the BBQ pork rice noodles. The filling was scant as expected; we ordered it because it came with the combo, and I really only wanted the combo for the milk tea. Hot HK milk tea always hits the spot in SF, where the weather is chilly and you could always use some caffeine. Ming Tai's version was too milky, but it was a nice way to end the meal on an authentically HK note.\n\nMing Tai is a small space and gets busy during peak times, but the wait isn't impossible. The kitchen is fast and the diners don't take too long to inhale their wonton noodle soup.", "author": "Edna C."}

The food is definitely 5/5.  The price is unbeatable; you get so much value for what you pay.  However, the service is 0/5.  I say zero, simply because there was lack of service.  \n\nThe GF and I came in at 10:30 am.  Upon walking in, there was a tiny dry erase board, which one could only assume is their wait list sign up.  So, we put our names down.  But, we soon figured out that the workers do not pay attention to the list.  They just ask who was here first.   This type of confusion is unnecessary and caused lots of anger and frustration towards the people waiting to get seated. \n\nTurnover is fast, but at the same time, slow.  Let me explain.  The two workers could not keep up with the orders, seating people, cleaning the tables, and dishing out checks.  I cannot express how much confusion there was.  So, what they did was simply wait for everyone at all tables to leave.  Then they cleaned all the tables at once.  Next, they sat people at every table.  After that, they took all the tables' orders.  They took the orders based on which table they were closest to, not by which persons got seated first.  I thought that was highly irregular and very irritating.   \n\nThe only reason why this place salvaged an extra star was because their food was too good.  The soy sauce chow mein was fresh and crisp.  The porridge was full of flavor.  The rice roll was soft on the outside and crispy on the inside.  The turnip cake was salty and savory.  All this for $18 was a steal.  \n\nI would be willing to give this place another try in the future.  I just wish they would hire more staff.  Yes, it would cost more money, but it would benefit everyone.  Service would be quicker and less stressful for employees, and diners would not have to wait as long.  \n\n\nP.S. It took 30 minutes to get seated, 15 minutes for the food to come out, 30 minutes to eat, and 15 minutes to get our check taken care of.

The restaurant was almost empty. We went in and saw the \"cash only\" sign so we had to walk all the way up to BOA and get some cash before finally sitting down.\n\nPig Blood Fish Filet Porridge: A.\n(Disclaimer: I'm a big fan of pig blood; the description would be kind of strange so please skip if you are not comfortable with it)\nOh wow the pig blood was definitely one of the best I have had in US. I guess usually restaurants use frozen pig blood which makes it completely lose the original blood clot taste. But not at this place. It really tasted like the ones I had in Asia. And texture too. It's a bit firm on the outside and super soft inside. I wish they made it in larger chunk instead of thin slices though. \nThe fish was good too. Again it tasted pretty fresh. Porridge was also surprisingly good. They put a lot of ginger inside and the saltiness was at the perfect level.\n\nShrimp rice roll: B.\nNothing special. Shrimp was okay, while the rice roll skin was kinda thick. Wouldn't have ordered it.\n\nSoy sauce fried noodle (\u8c49\u6cb9\u738b\u7092\u9762): B+.\nIt's not the hard crispy type that I was expecting. But it was still good. Strong bean sprouts taste and green onion taste.\n\nDumpling (\u6c34\u9bab): A-.\nIt was pretty nice. Big shrimp in each dumpling, thin skin, and they put a lot of mushroom inside which further enhanced the taste.\n\nAfter all, this place is called \u6d77\u7687\u7ca5\u9762 and they do live up the expectation on the porridge side. Will be totally down to try some other items on the menu too.", "author": "Simon C."}

We've had just about everything on the menu at this point and I can assure you it is all good. I generally am not a fan of congee, Chinese savory rice porridge, but I really like it here. They also have my favorite, Chu Cheong Fun, in a couple of formats - rolled rice noodles with a plum sauce, a peanut sauce, and a spicy sauce. Also try the \"ngau lei sou\" - I am butchering the Chinese here, but it is a slightly sweet, football shaped donut. And, of course, their Hong Kong milk tea is great.\n\nService is brisk here because it has to be. The line is long.

Because if you were so unfortunately having any of your personal items out of sight even for a second here, they would most likely be gone FOREVER! \n\nMy mom put her Rolex watch down (stupid, I know, but hear me out) on the table for a minute after accidentally spilling some tea on to her sleeves and didn't realize that she had left it there. Since my mom realized that her watch was missing the following morning, she and I had gone back to the store, separately on different occasion, wondering if they'd have seen and kept it for lost and found. First encounter I had to explain to staffs that weren't working the day of our visit. So I left them with my number for when they inquire with the staffs from different shifts. Days went by and I got zero ring. So my mom went there again to inquire about it. She was greeted by the same lady who had served us that day and the lady immediately recognized my mom, which my mom thought was a little odd already. Upon talking to her, the lady said that she hadn't found anything as she was cleaning after us. But also said that it was hard to say since there were always people walking in and out all the time. Note that during our visit, my mom and I were the last patrons of that late afternoon before they closed. Definitely not busy with us being the only table left when we dined there. There weren't anybody else there besides us and the staffs that work there. So unless the lady meant like the staffs walking in and out of there WITH my mom's watch, why emphasize that!?? I can't see how it would just magically disappear in thin air. I understand that I got no proof of any of them physically having my mother's watch. But just beware of leaving ANYTHING behind, even in tiny little family-owned-type restaurant. Can't trust anyone these days. \n\nIn terms of food, porridge and their rice noodle rolls are the only things I had kept going back for. But I was fed up with the staffs' horrible attitude and service even before this incident. Also they often run out of simple items, regardless the time of the day like it happened in the mid morning too, such as Chinese doughnuts, which is a pretty essential pairing to porridge. I guess I'd just drive a little further to Fat Wong's near Millbrae. At least parking would be easier there. \n\nConclusion: okay food, terrible parking, and most importantly staffs with horrible services and questionable ethics. Seems like the usual suspects you'd find in most Chinese restaurants. You've been warned.", "author": "Pearl T."}

The doughnuts came first , then some water . The rice dishes were pretty good, just remember it'll take a little longer than the soups and appetizers. The wonton broth was one of the best I've had, it's better than your typical watered down broth and had a meaty richness. The main thing that bothered me was the Chinese fried doughnut in both our dishes, it was just stale and over fried which ruined the rice noodle wrap that is supposed to compliment the dish as well as the jook .

The sweetness of the \"cow tongue mustache\" pairs well with the porridge and reminds me of a typical breakfast day in HK.  The steamed noodles were also well made, not too soft and not too hard with the right amount of texture.  I would try another porridge next time, mine was just too watery and tasted more like soup than porridge.", "author": "Harrison L."}

Well it doesn't matter what your real name is, because you never fail to make me feel better.\n\nI don't think there is another place in SF that I know of that sells porridge like this. No, it's not like the cheap bland disconnected porridge that you can get at any hong-kong cafe. This is legit, creamy, flavorful, made to order porridge. Unlike a lot of the hong-kong cafe porridge that taste like precooked the meat carelessly thrown into a stock of salted white porridge, Ming-Tai's porridge has a continuity between the taste of the white porridge and whatever ingredients you decide to put in there. So if you order a chicken porridge, not only would the chicken taste like chicken (duh), your porridge would actually have the chicken taste too (no, I don't want my porridge to taste like just salt!). \n\nDefinitely take advantage of their weekday breakfast special that lets you combine a porridge and noodle entree with a side dish for a valued price!

Some of their dishes are definitely lackluster, if not downright bad, such as their cheung fan, but you can't go wrong with their noodle soup and jook. Today we had:\n\nBeef Jook: Great jook and pretty good beef. Very simple and well made, tastes just liek what you would get for breakfast in HK. Not a lot to say except that it's definitely one of the better and more authentic jooks in SF.\n\nPork Ball Noodle Soup: My personal favorite addition, though really all their noodle soups are good. Noodles are nice and firm, with just the right flavor. Their pork balls are the best in the city, though I know pork balls aren't everyone's favorite. The broth is what makes it so amazing though, it's certainly the best I've had in SF and very comparable to an above average one found in HK.\n\nNiu Lisu (sweet chinese doughnut also known as Ox-Tongue Pastry) - I never actually tried this while in HK, so I'm not certain how it compares, however it seemed pretty solid and my dining companion said it was pretty good compared to back home. It's basically a deep fried doughnut that is slightly denser and has a crispy sweet topping on both sides. It was just ok for me, but I'm not much of a doughnut person in general.\n\nCheung Fan - I don't really remember what filling we had this time, but I have tried several different ones, and they were all bad. Usually overcooked and with little flavor. I'd recommend giving this a pass, you can find much better at most other restaurants, honestly.\n\nCome here, get your noodle soup and jook.

And when you somehow feel an MSG attack going on like an anxiety panic attack because of uhm... hypochondria.... it can get messy.\n\nHad to retry the shui gow (\"shrimp dumplings\") here because they were quite sexcellent at one point back in time, and wanted to see if their rendition still rises above the rest, one shui gow to rule them all.\n\nFile this one under \"greasy hole in the wall\". It's small, somewhat cramped, and gets filled up real quickly kind of joint by the local Cantonese speaking community. Ca$h only but for what you get it's cheap comfort fare in a super downscale environment.\n\nOne small piece of paper in Chinese on the wall, \"pork blood congee\". If you are familiar with Cantonese Chiu Chow cuisine (marinated pork blood cubed gelee) or the Vietnamese bun bo hue noodle soup that has these cubes, then this won't be foreign to you. But otherwise probably not recommended for the casual congee eater.\n\nOn the table, at least the one I sat on, very grimey and worn looking over the ages. One specials plaque advertising old skool \"cow tongue pastry\" that formerly only Taiwan Restaurant on Clement (I think?) and Hing Lung in SF offered. MT only has this on weekends.\n\nOn the flipside, curry fishball skewers, and honey bacon wrapped sausages. Loved the logo, but very out of place for this hole.\n\nAppetizer plain cheung fun with soy sauce, sesame sauce, and some hoisin looking paste for dip n' mix on the side...get your carbs on while you wait painstakingly for your main course. Pre-steamed CF? Made in house? Well for the price I'm not expecting anything so long it hits the spot.\n\nHot milk tea - on the weak side, not as good as Tak Kee Lee next door. Now if only I can order true dai pai dong style (ie mix and match my meal from different eating establishments), i.e. pick up a cuppa hot milk tea from TKL and bring it into MT, that would be freakin swell.\n\nShui Gow Noodles - Maybe I should have ordered plain bowl of shui gow in broth, no noodles....perhaps I would have received 6 to 8 pieces of shui gow. SGN came with only 4 dumplings, guess they could only fit them across the width of the bowl (I'm used to getting 5, maybe that's the # of their golf ball inauthentic style wun tuns). Appearance wise they are as huge as ever, with excess slacking dumpling skin the way they should, form fitting...and if you are a bit of a food pervert, like skin tights. The interior... hmmm mostly fatty pork and some shrimp that lacked that crunch, but pseudo compensated with slivers of woodear funghi. Missing were bamboo shoot slivers and shitake mushrooms in the traditional receipe...DOH. Overall still not bad, and better than Cooking Papa and Champagne (Millbrae) lumpy SG. Broth and noodles you ask? Broth was actually not bad, not as sharp as Cooking Papa's dried tilefish + shrimp won ton broth, and noodles had decent crunch, but if only they used bamboo pole noodles like King of Won Ton on Irving on their best day.....oh well can't beat em all.\n\nService was actually not bad from a Cantonese speaking perspective, which is not saying much if viewed with a set of Westernized eyes and ears and nose. Didn't this place used to have dudes in the kitchen? Spotted two female waitstaff and another female in the kitchen. Changed hands (and gender)?\n\nCome for the shui gow.

When you bite into the dumpling, you get a thinly sliced mushroom that adds a nice fresh crisp to the dumpling. I always get noodles and drink all of the soup, even though my tongue is dry afterward. \n\nOn the weekdays between 11am-3pm, if you order two or more items from a certain part of the menu, you get an item for free! There's a picture of that menu on the photos portion of this restaurant.\n\nAlso, the head chef in the back is very nice. She's the only one that speaks perfect English and, once in a while, comes out. When she does, she gives the best service, and with a smile!", "author": "Vanson N."}

Call me an old man, but I absolutely love eating this stuff! :O\n\nThey added Pork Blood Porridge to their menu. Well, it's on the wall (in chinese), so we decided to try it. We also ordered a beef stew lo mein. The blood was really soft, but lacked taste. The cilantro and ginger over powered the delicacy of the blood; a bit of a disappointment. The beef stew lo mein was so rich. Few bites in and I felt full. There wasn't much meat either; most of the piece were tendon. \n\nOverall, today's experiences wasn't the greatest, but the porridge is what gets me! I've eaten here a many times and I'm never too disappointed was I leave.

The won tons are huge and stuffed with yummy filling.

It arrived hotter than the seat heater in hubby's car and took awhile for me to eat. The porridge was watery & bland. Big chunks of chicken, slivers of ginger and 5 slices of abalone were mixed into the congee. I tried one of their Chinese donuts, which was skinny, crunchy and hard on the outside and bland. Hubby thought it was too oily. \n\nIn the middle of the nite, I was awoken with stomach cramps, something which rarely happens to me after dining in restaurants. Hubby even said it was probably the congee. \n\nThe place is small and at senior dining hours, 5:30PM, there were many tables filled and everyone cleared out quickly, leaving only a couple when we were leaving. The most popular dishes ordered seem to be the rice dishes in metal pots, won ton noodle, turnip cake, dumplings.

Let's go get some noodle soup!  Yay...!!\n\nAfter yelping, we decided to go to Ming Tai Wun-Tun Noodle place on Noriega Ave between 31st and 32nd Ave.  The good thing about 8 o,n, ib a rainy Friday is that we found parking right away.  And the place only had 2 other customers.  Just the way we like it.  Nice and quiet dinner on a Friday evening.  After looking at the menu, we decided on Beef Brisket Noodle soup and BBQ Pork Wonton Noodle soup.\n\nMy fiance's beef noodle soup came out first -- it smelled really good and had lots of beef on it.  And not chucks of fat, just the way he likes it.  And my noodle soup came out and it had 3 BIG pieces of wonton and about 6 slicesof BBQ pork.  Each of those wonton had FOUR shrimps.  Yeap..FOUR shrimps.  I was amazed.  The soups were delish!!  We didn't taste much MSG.  I don't even think they use MSG.  But who knows.  The proportion was just perfect too -- not too small and not too big.  It was just the right amount.  And the red chili that they had at the table?  Well, it was wow!!  It's so darn good.  I think they may have added vinegar to it?  Or something.  Damn..I long for it now.  ha ha.  For both soups, we paid ~$14.  No complaints from us what-so-ever!  We'll definitely go back!\n\nI do agree with other people -- the place is kind of small.  I think it may fit about 20-25 people.  But it's definitely clean.  And they only accept cash.  \n\nHave fun visiting this place -- it's so good!", "author": "Joyce L."}

The pieces of chicken, like the wontons that others in my party had, were huge.  The wontons had 2-3 shrimps in each.  I found it difficult to pick up the big chicken pieces with my chopstick.

Very simple, but the ingredients are fresh and they don't skimp on the shrimp. For the carb conscious you can also get the won ton or dumplings without noodles and it's still a filling dish. If you are going to order the noodles I would definitely recommend ordering the egg noodles over the ramen as the egg noodles have a lot more flavor.\n\nThe jook also has the right texture and is flavorful without needing to put too much extra soy sauce or white pepper in it.

The regular wonton or dumpling and noodle orders come with 4 giants sized wontons or dumplings! (The difference between wontons and dumplings? Wontons are spherical, filled with pork and whole shrimp. Dumplings are more of an oblong shape, with the addition of a few strips of wood ear fungus to the pork and shrimp filling). I don't know that ordering the beef stew version is worth it since I haven't tried it yet, I would think it might be better to just order a plate of that separately.\n\nTip: If you come on weekdays around lunch time bring a buddy! There's a special where if you order two noodle soups, you can get a free item: some cooked chinese broccoli, a small order of chinese beef stew, or some cheurng fun. \n\nThe only complaint I had was that when I ordered the chinese fritter with the rice noodle wrapped around it, it wasn't very hot when I got it. :(\n\nOther than that, I don't know what other people complain so much about.

The shrimp dumpling noodles at Ming Tai are mutant wontons that are the size of a 10 year old's fist. They are full of plump, whole sweet shrimp (not the gelatinous force-meat product that sometimes fills shrimp dim sum and dumpling products), crunchy strips of wood ear mushrooms, and chivey bits. Giant they are. The swirling bed of yellow egg noodles are perfect, it's not difficult to make good yellow noodles and these are as they should be, cooked to the proper Asian version of al dente. Sparkling, long simmered broth, the appropriate balance of saltiness, a few leaves of cooked lettuce, and more chivey bits complete the bowl.\nAlso tried the beef brisket wonton noodle soup. Rich, dark beef broth, copious chunks of tender brisket and lots of chewy fatty bits, plus wontons the size of golf balls encasing the same sweet, whole shrimp, and yummy yellow noodles.\nClientele is 98% Asian, and the place is small, about six 2-tops and three 4-tops. Line at the door, and simple menu of congee, dry noodles and noodle soup, and a few side dishes. Feel free to take the pale palates along, as they also serve a handful of classic sandwiches (ham and cheese, etc), different macaroni dishes (no idea what those are like), and fries.

Maybe the cook was making everything at once because about 4 tables got their food at the same time.  The won ton is sooo good though.  Definitely worth a trip back!", "author": "Kris L."}

Does it have abalone in the won tons?  Don't get me wrong, the food is good.  Knock off $1 per bowl and you get yourself another star.", "author": "Ezduzit S."}

Same price will get you way more ingredients.  But you have to try to know, right?  Parking might be a bit easier here but make that 3 to 5 min drive over to Irving.  You'll thank yourself once you've started digging in.", "author": "Mark W."}

Hing Lung is still #1, but I live in the Sunset, so Ming-Tai is much more convenient. The congee is smooth, tasty and always piping hot. It's the best for cold rainy days. (However, the congee is only the freshest in the mornings. Don't get it if you go there in the evening.) You get a big bowl for like $4. On the weekdays, there's a special where you can get a bowl of congee and a side - all for just $3.50! Can't beat that! Service is ok, but what can you expect from a tiny casual Chinese restaurant in the Sunset?", "author": "Cee J."}

Its wonton and shrimp dumplings are simply the best-in-class!  They are not only big in size, but also juicy and fresh!  I also love its iced milk tea, shrimp cheung fun and beef stew.  If you're looking for a place with the best HK-style wonton noodle, this is it!  Of course, this is not a place to please your gf in your first date either  :p", "author": "Jacky L."}

Ginormous wontons in the wonton soup.  The rest of the stuff is very mediocre.  E.g., I would pass on the barbecued pork (either homemade -- not in a good way, or purchased from a not-so-good place) and the fried donut wrapped in fun (kind of small).", "author": "Rich H."}
