Golden coffee shop is a cute little diner style restaurant with counter top seats on Sutter Ave.\n\nI mean I'm not sure if anyone cares about this...but the interior design is ADORABLE. The pink walls make me feel like I'm in a rom-com movie, waiting to for my Prince Charming to walk through the doors and order the same thing as me..?? LOL. \n\nAnyways, the food here is absolutely DELICIOUS AND CHEAP!! The prices are so affordable, no where can you find these kinds of prices in San Francisco. I ordered the Jack, Avocado, and Salsa omelette for $7.95! It comes with slices of bread (your choice, I chose sourdough) and hash browns! It's a family owned business and you can tell they work so hard. My friend ordered the waffles with fresh strawberries and whipped cream and it looked mouthwatering. She said she thoroughly enjoyed that as well. Service is good too, nothing too special but all the workers have a smile on their face which made me feel very welcomed :-)\n\nOh! And despite yelp's information, they DO take credit cards which is a +++\n\nI wish I had a Golden Coffee Shop in the Silicon Valley I would be there every weekend.

They serve Chinese food (which is actually really good). The staff is friendly. The service isn't too slow. But really it's a cute little diner servicing decent food for a decent price. I really like the corned beef hash. I don't know what else to say about this place except that it's my favorite little breastfast place in the city when I just want an easy breakfast.

Even the plastic cups seemed ancient. We were able to get seated fairly quickly at the counter. \n\nI ordered corned beef hash and scrambled eggs. Lots of yelp reviewers had raved about them.  Hash browns and white toast came with it. I wish wheat was an option. Sadly, the hash seemed straight out of the can. Not sure what previous reviewers were going ga ga over. The hash browns were on point. Very crispy. And, the scrambled eggs were perfectly cooked. Very moist. \n\nIt took awhile for our water to be refilled. The eggs that I received were not scrambled like i asked for. That was remedied. The servers werent friendly, but more business-like. Reinforcements were brought in later to help with the large number of customers. \n\nSadly, what it comes down to is that I can get canned corned beef hash at home. I don't need to come here for that. My girlfriend also makes really great corned beef hash. I won't be back. There are other places out there to try.", "author": "Sean A."}

I do not know why this place is highly rated because the food is terrible. I had French toast which looked like regular white bread with scrambled eggs stuck on it. I got it with a side of bacon, which came out overcooked. My friend got a BLT. It's just a sandwich and I didn't think it could be bad, but it was. The bacon was raw, basically, and the bread was just barely toasted. The fries it came with were as crispy as potato chips.

It's a show about a group of adolescent friends banding together with a psychokinetic girl who eats Eggo waffles to uncover the truth about a sinister government cover-up and finding their friend who has been taken by an insidious being. The blend of science fiction, horror and 80s pop culture have drawn you in completely; you haven't felt this connected to a show since the 2003 cultural zeitgeist The O.C., widely regarded by historians and theoretical physicists as the most important human achievement of the 21st century.\n\n\"Not again,\" your roommate Matt complains, as you restart the season for the third time in a row. You walk over to the chair you have him duct taped to and reapply his gag. While you are trying to shove a 24 Hour fitness gym towel in his mouth he manages to sputter out, \"Just stop eating the weed brownies! This always happens! Bad things always happen!\"\n\nThis triggers a split-flashback of you taking over the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland in an attempt to make Orange Chicken and inadvertently ending the universe: http://bit.ly/29O7FOd\n\nWhat was that? It felt so real. You shake it off but contemplate your roommate Matt's warning about the weed brownies. You take another bite. \n\nLeft with too many questions at the end of the season finale, you decide that you must travel back to the 80s and figure out how the story ends. \n\nGo to Golden Coffee Shop where the 80s never ended. From the prices to the d\u00e9cor, this place has been caught in a time bubble and protected from the horrors of modernization. \n\nTo find out what happened to Eleven you have to become Eleven. Order her favorite food. \n\n\"Gimme a Lego,\" you shout to no one in particular as you burst through the door. Sit at the counter and compose yourself. Do not take another bite of the weed brownie. \n\nYou take another bite of the weed brownie. \n\n\"Gimme a Lego,\" you say again to the waitress. \n\nShe looks at you in confusion.\n\n\"Leggo my Eggo,\" you blurt out. \n\nShe takes a step back. \n\n\"Legolas!\" you yell while pointing to the terrified patron's waffle who is sitting next to you. \n\nThe waitress picks up the phone. \n\n\"Secret Things is the best show about Eggo friends!\" you yell to the startled crowd. \n\nThis is taking too long to find resolution. You grab a knife and cut yourself to draw blood and summon the monster to get to the Outside World.  \n\nAs your first drop of blood hits the floor Mitt Romney appears in a cloud of smoke. Your vision becomes blurry since your ulnar artery won't stop leaking and you pass out. \n\nDeath, in the form of a crow's skull appears before you. \"Not you again,\" he says.", "author": "Dave G."}

I have to say, I like the way they prepared the egg here. it was much more flavorful than some other breakfast spots I have been to where despite being rated well, their eggs seemed bland. here there was a lot of good flavor which I truly appreciated. the hash browns were nothing too special, but were a good  accompaniment. \n\nnote that this place is cash only which makes it a place I can see a lot of regulars going to, but probably not tourist necessarily. \n\noverall, while not pretty to look at, I can say that this place is somewhere I would definitely go to again when I'm looking for a quick breakfast that is very well priced and easy. nice little place that I can see being a regular spot for many! \n\n*chirp!*", "author": "Jei C."}

But for what it is -- a neighborhood divey greasy spoon -- it's practically perfect.\n\nI have done some snooping on the interwebs, but can find no history on the place. I suppose I could ask the folks that work there, but they're all so damn busy (and efficient). All I know is that I have been going there for almost 20 years now, and it's great. In my mind it has been open for decades, run by multiple generations of the same Chinese family. But that's just my dive fantasy... \n\nLove the wrap-around counter, and because I generally go there by myself I rarely wait for a seat -- parties of 3+ will be more challenged. People watching is an added benefit to the counter: the odd old neighborhood farts you know who have been dining there for decades, European tourists, and (now) douchey hipsters who sadly discovered this gem a few years ago. Oh well...\n\nAgain, all good diner food. My go-to's are the Denver omelet or the steak and eggs (the hash browns are aways perfect), and a burger or BLT (and the fries are aways perfect). The coffee? Meh. It's okay. I have certainly had worse. They do some Chinese rice dishes, none of which I have tried. It's rare for me to leave with a check more than $10.\n\nSo, get it on your list.", "author": "Corey M."}

This is a small shop! It has a triangle of seats where sometimes your elbow to elbow with people and 2 tables in the front. Second .... the food, some of it is from a can and they obviously buy their breakfast meats from Costco but they aren't even hiding that fact.\n\nWhen you need an awesome breakfast .... they have good selection of traditional breakfast items including sausage (Jimmy Dean), bacon (I think Oscar Meyer), and Corned Beef Hash from a large can! The waffles, pancakes, and hash browns are hand made. They also have an amazing chicken soup that is delicious!\n\nIf you order a steak you can have it with hash browns or steak rice .... don't want toast? Ask for a dinner roll! They are open to whatever.\n\nPrices are good, very cheap!", "author": "Kris D."}

There are a lot of pretentious restaurants here, with sky-high prices, and moderate portions...and a line to get in.\n\nAs others have mentioned, it is an old diner, probably from the 50s.  U-shaped counter, and a few tables near the windows.  The wife works inside the \"U,\" and hubby works the grill.\n\nContrary to other reviews, I think their coffee is pretty good, and I'm picky about coffee...I hate weak coffee.\n\nI have always had a special with two eggs, corned beef hash, hashbrowns, and a waffle.  Egg plates come with toast, as well.\n\nWatching pops make the corned beef is amazing.  I don't think it is canned.  He fries it first in a skillet, and then BAKES it...it comes out nice and crisp, yet moist.  Best I've ever had.  The hashbrowns are similar...not overly greasy, yet always crisp and brown.\n\nWaffle: I grew up on \"Small-square\" waffles, not the ubiquitous \"Belgian waffle\" with one-inch squares.  The smaller squares/ridges make for a crispier (and tastier) waffle.  No comparison.\n\nA lot of food, and cheap...that breakfast runs about $13 out the door.  \n\nWhile it looks VERY divey, it seems clean.  It is always Mom and Pop running it (once I saw what I think was the daughter as well).  \"Mom\" isn't overly friendly, but I think mostly driven by weak English skills.  If you are coming from the Hilton Union Plaza, you have to go through some sketchy areas to get here.  (Lots of bums sleeping on sidewalks). It's worth \nit.\n\nI see a lot of the same locals in here every time...that's a testament in itself.

So I opted to give $5 to the nice family that runs this coffee shop for a scrambled egg, two sausage links, and four avocado slices (instead of hash and toast). I don't understand Cantonese, but it seemed that my request to sub avocado for hash and toast met some resistance with the chef. However, he gave in, which helped me stick to my no-carb diet.\n\nI sat and ate my breakfast quietly while listening to the two other patrons talking at each other from across the two sides of the greasy spoon about some guy asking one of them for money. The other patron advised not signing up for a co-dependent relationship, which I silently agreed with.\n\nThe verdict: You will find me at Golden Coffee when I need to outsource breakfast on the cheap.

Uh-huh. Seriously. Think about it. They both have wide-open kitchens, long counters, just two tables and four people maneuvering in highly cramped quarters. From that point, the comparison falters as the Golden Coffee Shop is a dive, pure and simple. I just wish they served hearty comfort food to balance out the spartan surroundings. \n\nThat's not to say the owners don't take their business seriously. They're a grim-faced crew very focused on the dine-and-dash breakfasts they serve there. The place was fairly packed when I got there around 10:30AM on Saturday. I noticed there was a lone stool right at the edge of the grill and sink where - for better or worse - I had an unblemished view of the entire operation. In fact, they kept placing the dirty dishes and glasses right in front of me since the sink was beneath me to the left. If they gave me a pair of extra-large Playtex gloves, I would have definitely pitched in rather than stare at them during my meal. \n\nObviously, this place has its devotees, and you certainly can't beat the price - $6 for their Joe's Special, which comes with hash browns and toast (see my photo). That's about half the price of the same dish at the SoMa Inn Cafe. But I have to tell you that the eggs had that slightly aged flavor that I found none too pleasing. The people watching, however, is great if nobody catches you staring at them. Regardless, I don't think I'll be back any time soon. If I want serious grease in my food, I've got artery clogging options closer to my 'hood. \n\nFOOD - 2 stars...hmm, that tainted egg taste doesn't quite leave your tongue, does it? \nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...I think I remember a roadside diner scene in \"The Grapes of Wrath\" that kinda looked like this place \nSERVICE - 2. stars...very serious but could you move those dirty dishes please? \nTOTAL - 2 stars...I shall grease my spoon elsewhere", "author": "Ed U."}

He cooks the eggs perfectly, flips them without use of a spatula, shreds his potatoes by hand and cooks them to a perfect crispiness on the flat top.  He does this all while yielding a mysterious \"butter mop\", which he uses on just about everything and is, most likely, responsible for much of the tastiness.

We got:\n\n*WAFFLE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rBwyayyqFMD8chqenrRxag?select=asBDICt90uErvMQyY4Whfw): Although I'm partial to the thicker and larger-pocketed Belgian waffle, I was very happy with the thinner Eggo-like waffle I had here. The batter tasted great and, more importantly, it was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I loved it!\n\n*FRENCH TOAST (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rBwyayyqFMD8chqenrRxag?select=XBpaqyx_Ezca7gqov78iJw): Not the best I've had but still very good. I liked how eggy the outsides were but I prefer my French toast moister.\n\n*PANCAKE SANDWICH (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rBwyayyqFMD8chqenrRxag?select=LHTcGYwkIxJp-6AmFTq-Pw): The moist buttermilk pancakes were cooked just right with a nicely browned crust. (There's nothing worse than gummy, undercooked pancakes!) While they were a little on the dense side they still maintained a certain fluffiness. My over easy egg was perfectly cooked and the yolk oozed out beautifully. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausages though since they were all shriveled.\n\n*SPANISH OMELET (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rBwyayyqFMD8chqenrRxag?select=51PSM1gGecJqX365M4OhFQ): Not your typical omelet as the fillings were placed on top of the folded eggs. The tomato sauce was a little too sweet but I still liked it. On the plus side the egg itself was light and fluffy. The best part of the dish were the hash browns--super crispy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. The shredded potatoes had the perfect texture and weren't mushy at all. I could've eaten a whole plate of them! (This dish also came with toast, which I'm not gonna comment much on since toast is toast.

Eggs, bacon or sausage, white or wheat.  That's pretty much about it.  They also offer sandwiches and some Americanized Chinese food.  But again, the only reason I would ever go into a diner would be for breakfast, so I can't speak to anything else.  The breakfast however is perfect!

It was a beautiful day up in the city and we took a 15-minute walk to make it to the Golden Coffee Shop.  it's a total hole-in-the-wall, with only counter seating available;  all of which was pretty much all taken.  We shoe horned ourselves into two corner seats and took a look at the menu.  \n\nThe menu was totally bare bones with just the basics and nothing too fancy which is exactly we wanted.  I ordered a spinach and mushroom omelet with hash browns and a cup of coffee.  They have an open kitchen so I could watch the cook make my breakfast.   When my order arrived, the hash browns were crispy (totally an A+ for me) and the omelet was simple, and hit the spot. \n\nGreat breakfast place, and for the price a total steal.  For the 2 of us, it was under $20.  Yes.  $20 for 2 people in the city.  Great find in the city and if you want something no-frills this is it!", "author": "Eugene F."}

Different, too.\n\nThe restaurant is basically a U-shaped counter, with customers on the outside and one man on the inside taking orders.  He takes the order and give it to the one single cook, whose in the same room as you in plain sight, at the top of the U, cooking food..  The only other employee(?) I could see was a woman who was constantly going downstairs to get supplies.\n\nThis unique business model works.  The waiter-guy is always in the center of the U, so it's easy to get his attention.  He, the cook, and the lady seemed to be telepathically linked because things moved along really smoothly without much interaction between them.\n\nThe reason they get 4 stars is because you have to sit really close to other diners, and the food was just OK, nothing spectacular or even above-average.

Plus I had been wanting forever to check out the Swedish pancakes at Sears Fine Food. We made our way down the hill only to find the place beyond packed. I (we) were hungry for a quality greasey spoon breakfast and we were not going to be denied. \n\nMy friend mentioned a place up the hill on Sutter which I mistakenly thought it was a different place near my Dentist office. That place never appealed and I almost nixed it but my friend was insistent that it was \"my kind of place\" that this place is the quintessential with the greasiest breakfast food in the entire city and about as \"low profile\" a place could possibly be. \n\nI must admit I was a bit pouty as we walked up the hill and thinking we were heading to Loris Diner or a Denny's. It was Sunday December 13th and this date I will now never forget as I found the mother of all grease spoon diners. The minute you spot it you would swear that you have discovered what inspired Edward Hopper to paint. This place is about as no frills as you can get. The diner has one large u-shaped counter with simple swivel stools and just one lonely table by the window. No fancy signage or TGIF type menus. Just your basic city diner with the simplest of menus. At this point I had fallen in love and it didn't even matter what the food tasted like. This place is beyond perfect for me. \n\nBu yes, I should review the food. On this day I went with the corned beef hash and eggs. The eggs were over medium and perfectly cooked. The corned beef has was heavenly and not too fancy like those earthy organic places you would find in Marin. Theirs was simple with juicy bits of potatoes in each bite. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. \n\nThe only drawback is their hot chocolate as it was on the sweet side. I'm not sure why diners can never serve a decent cup of hot cocoa. I ended up just asking for a cup of coffee where I dumped a gallon of cream and 90 ounces of sugar in it. I know I know, I was just blasting the sweet hot cocoa and kind of sort of contradicting myself right now. \n\nSoma Inn Cafe is still my favorite breakfast spot in the City, but if you are looking for ambiance you can do no better than stumbling in here at 11:00 in the morning.", "author": "V B."}

More often than not you will be sitting next to someone you may find odd, but as an artist I find these people amazing and they always have great stories to tell. \n-This place is not good for big families. The seating is limited and as most of us that go there are regulars we ask you keep your kids from being obnoxious and running around, we will not hesitate to grill and eat them. \n-The coffee is no Blue Bottle mind you, but in my book their coffee tastes great (as opposed to Denny's ass coffee) and will wake you up in minutes! That's what I love.\n-The food tastes really great and the portions are just right! It's cash only but breakfast for one will cost you around $5, maybe $8 max depending on what you get. \n-They don't only serve breakfast, they have lunch as well.\n-The menu is limited so if you are looking to be wow'd, don't go there. It's a simple diner with simple food. \n-The atmosphere is that of your grandma's 70's style kitchen almost. I personally love it because it has character.

So I obviously yelped it right then and there on the trusty iphone and learned that it had a rating of FOUR stars.\n\nSo we decided to try it out today.  Patricia P texted me about how she was concerned with the deliciousness level and I convinced her that it was a 4 star joint, so it had to be pretty quality.\n\nI ordered a denver omelet with avocado and she ordered the waffles with a side of sausage and hashbrowns.  They first drop off my toast. Five mins later, Patty gets her janky looking waffle.  Five mins after that, she gets her sausage and hashbrowns.  Finally, five-ish mins after that, I get the rest of my food. Unacceptable.\n\nMy eggs were actually pretty good, but nothing else was.  I don't think this place is worth it.", "author": "Jenny W."}

This is probably because they put absolutely no money into decorating this place. There is a horseshoe shaped formica counter and the flourecent lights are an afterthought to the natural light pouring in the front windows. There is an air of greasiness.

It is fascinating and admirable that it has not been renovated back to its prime. The elegant curves of the counter are balanced by the horribly plain walls. You can just stare at the place and imagine another time. Han's cannot match this experience.You are eating at an unrestored museum--special.\nThe food? Han's offers a far wider menu but I fell for Golden's portion control and simple aesthetic. There is less food at Golden but in more pleasing form and in (thankfully) smaller portions.\nObviously Han's has the odd bathroom attraction but Golden offers the creepy stairs to the dish washing area.\nHey, both places offer the obvious fare but Golden just does simple better. If you want the more unusual you gotta go across the street.\nAn added bonus is the affable, low-key energy of the guy running Golden. If you need to be calmed down from the City life, then spend 30 minutes in his company--afforadble therapy.", "author": "Sean G."}

I had the corned beef hash with two eggs, and the grand total came to $6. I was pretty satisfied, but people with bigger appetites will probably want to take advantage of the very low prices by ordering a bit more.\n\nAs far as the taste goes, I was impressed. My scrambled eggs were made just how I like them (a little fluffy but not too light, not wet/yolky but not rubbery/dry either). The corned beef tasted good too, although it wasn't the strongest I've ever had. That's probably a good thing if you're overwhelmed by the flavor of corned beef elsewhere as I occasionally am.\n\nEven though I was very content with my order, I was watching the cook prepare dishes for other people, and I was a bit jealous of whoever ordered the french toast, bacon, and scrambled eggs. The french toast and bacon both looked thick and amazingly good, and I already said that the scrambled eggs were made just how I like them. I will definitely be returning, and when I do, this is exactly what I will be ordering.\n\nI'm not going to knock them on their atmosphere too much, but I'm not going go give them much praise for it either. It's simple and I felt comfortable, but it's not really the most charming place on earth. So in other words, if you're a tourist or just want something a little more magical, then go elsewhere.\n\nIf you're having one of those mornings where you want to treat yourself by going out for brunch but don't really need to impress yourself or don't feel like spending more than a few bucks, than this place is what you're looking for.", "author": "James L."}

I stopped for a few of reasons.  1) It is half a block from my house. 2) There are always people in here...and that is usually the sign of good food 3) The greasy smell was exactly what my hangover was looking for.\n\nI have to say, this place did not disappoint.  I usually keep it simple...eggs with hash browns and toast.  The price can't be beat...without meat but with a cup of coffee the whole meal comes to just about $5 and that includes tip!  Really, you can't go wrong.  The hash browns (and the siracha sauce they have to go one them) are great....crispy on the outside but they still have a potato-ness about them.

That phrase makes me think of a German made clock --- hand made, oozing craftsmanship with its cranks running smoothly in the background.\n\nInside of \"Golden Coffee\" on the corner of Leavenworth and Sutter, that is exactly what you will find.  \n\nThe man that took my order was probably in his 60's, and OK with the fact that he is still working because he is obviously just doing what he loves.  I ordered water (it was a long night) and a coffee with an English muffin and corned beef hash with 2 eggs scrambled.  The man wrote my order down and then took down my friend's order (who is in town from Indiana, just visiting SF for 24 hours) and passes the slip over to the cook at the back of the restaurant.\n\nNoticing a strange kink in my back that is starting to form as I try to sit completely upright (as Leavenworth is a very sloped st. and things aren't always balanced or level) I look over at this man who very calmly opens up the freezer to use his tongs and grab 2 ice cubes for my water.  I think to myself, \"ah... very nice execution --- I don't want your fingers touching my ice\" and then the man to my right finishes his breakfast, gets his bill, pays with a 20, and walks off with his exact change.  He didn't leave a single dollar for a tip and my jaw almost hit the ground.  I immediately wonder how it is possible that the people of the food service industry have not completely revolted out of intolerance for people like this --- having to take orders all day and remain pleasant - so I decide I will make up for this man's insolence and reward the establishment with a handsome tip when I go to cash out.\n\nThe food shows up, and it is glorious.  The portions are healthy and the \"chef\" is obviously proud of his work standing there nodding his head (he is the kind of guy that you can just tell has some sort of release in life.  He hits the gym after work and practices Karate or something on a routine basis and probably has one hell of a left hook).  \n\nUnlike a lot of the more popular breakfast / brunch places of the city, there is plenty of room to sit at the bar like table with chairs bolted to the ground and look out the window onto the street and people watch while you eat and soak in a Saturday mid-morning of a calm, California climate.\n\nIf you are in Lower Knob Hill and looking for a good clean breakfast joint, I recommend that you check out Golden Coffee.  The Golden reference is (or can be in my opinion) a direct correlation to the service and experience you will have inside.  \n\nSure, it is just a place to get a meal (one of a thousand in the city) but in this place, they go that extra mile to keep a smile on your face.  \n\nGo, check it out and become what I will be after today --- a repeat customer...", "author": "Benjamin G."}

I've had the corned beef hash, the pork fried rice and the fish and chips.  Don't get the fish and chips, they were not cooked all the way and too salty.  The pork fried rice is good but too much onion is used.  The corned beef hash was probably my favorite.  I guess the moral of the story is to stick with breakfast.  At least the prices are cheap and it's a good hangover cure.  Things are just a bit oversalted in my opinion.  It's my roomie's favorite breakfast joint but that's not much of an endorsement as he's kind of a creature of habit and not terribly inspired (I LOVE you Jason!

It reminds me of a place my grandpa would take me.  We'd walk thru the vineyards, past the highschool, past the livestock auction and meet up with his brothers.  They would complain about the Reagan administration.  I would eat sorta burned hashbrowns and drink bad coffee.  They're all dead now and that coffeeshop and all the rest are buried under ugly cheek to jowl mediterranean style housing developments, and maybe a Home Depot too.   This divey place reminds me of them and all that and how almond trees make March smell like honey.  So I eat here even though it's probably dirty.

The only breakfast place in all of SF that you can get tasty food and great coffee for less than $8 per person. It's unheard of! The guys that work there are awesome. I don't even have to order, they already know what I want. Plus they open at 7 am so if you've managed to stay up all night you can eat before you pass out. They aren't open for dinner which only makes you appreciate it more. It can get a bit crowded between 9 - 11 especially on the weekends. But its soooo worth it!", "author": "Victoria V."}

The decor reminds me of a new york style cafe, but not in a scummy way. There are usually papers to read that people leave for others. This place is family owned, and the owner is very friendly and kind, and seems like a pretty happy old man. The food is delicious! Really delicious. Compared to Han's across the street, the portions are smaller, but still good sized. You can get anything from a small bowl of oatmeal up to an omelette or breakfast plate. The jack, avacado, and salsa omelette is probably the best omellette I have ever tried in my life. The coffee is bottomless for 1.35. The people in this place are always pretty cool, an unusual mix of art students, businessmen, and friends gathering in the city together. I really have nothing bad to say about this place, other than it's too delicious and nearby for me to resist. Note: Han's across the street is also very good. I usually alternate between the two businesses.", "author": "Alexander W."}

Golden Coffee is quite the conundrum. While I love the food (bacon, two eggs over medium, french fries and white toast) and the price is certainly right, on three different occasions they have forgotten to serve me my toast with my breakfast, whats more is when they do bring it, approximately 10 to 15 minutes late, its not with an apology, not that I expect one but you know...It kind of would go a long way in assuring me they realize there is a problem and are trying to correct. Hell don't correct it, just sort of acknowledge it... Anyways I am still going to keep coming and I am still going to aggressively chase down my toast.", "author": "Salvatore R."}

And the coffee was, well Golden!  Coffee in a lot of places like this is usually awful.  Not here, it's great.

Golden Coffee never ceases to amaze me -- in my experience, every seat is always taken, but there's never a wait. Somehow, two people are just getting up to leave from the horseshoe shaped counter just as I arrive.  The staff moves about in quiet and determined focus -- never rushing, never dawdling -- carefully using tongs to place exactly two ice cubes (never more, never less) into your water glass as you are seated.  Conversation among both the staff and patrons is kept to a minimum and at a measured volume -- not reverentially hushed, but certainly not boisterous.  This is about breakfast, plain and simple, when you want a well fortified but gentle start to your day.  The pancakes are among the best I've ever had, and the egg dishes are straight forward and prepared exactly as you would expect by a classic diner.  A couple of Chinese-inspired rice plate dishes are available as an extra bonus at breakfast.  A golden choice for breakfast!", "author": "Matthew B."}
