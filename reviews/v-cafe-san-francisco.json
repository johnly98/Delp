Try one of their hell-aciously delicious cheese steak sandwiches, except during lunch when this place gets crushed by the locals. \n\nThere's a small seating area and the owner/employees are genuinely polite & friendly. A nice combination like that goes along with their dyn-O-mite product.\n\nHuge, juicy, and flavorful sandwiches here. Don't forget their crispy waffle fries, along with a soft drink. That is a wonderful thing. I used to work nearby, but no longer. I have a hole in my food heart whenever I get the craving for a cheese steak sando and think of V Caf\u00e9. \n\nIf I am anywhere near this place and with even a hint of hunger hanging around (and it's not lunchtime: 11AM-1PM) I will indeed make the time for their creations.

Staff is really friendly, just not a huge fan of the location. \n\nWhy I was here // My bf picked this place out for a mid-weeknight dinner around 6pm. He's a huge fan of philly cheesesteaks, grease, and all things bacon. \n\nLocation // street parking was easy to find on a weeknight. I didn't really like the area that it was located, didn't feel as safe or pleasant to sit inside or outside the cafe. I will definitely be doing takeout for next time. \n\nService // very friendly staff! \n\nFood // The V Cheese Steak // super delicious and total comfort food. Soft french bread, a foot in length, filled with juicy beef, cheese, and bacon (bit heavy on the bacon in my opinion), onions, pepper (I did a mix of sweet and spicy), and topped with avocado. \nAbsolute taste explosion! Super filling and I was so satisfied. \n\nOverall // I really enjoyed their sandwich! I would come back for another but I can't eat this too often as I felt pretty sluggish afterward.", "author": "Emily T."}

Back then, I took advantage of their free delivery and got them to bring me their big hoagies to get my sandwich fix in on many a lazy evening after work. I can still be \"sloth-like\", but even though I live close by, I entered this semi-popular spot for the very first time last week on my way back from Rainbow Grocery. Looking for a little lunch with my fiddlehead ferns and dried mango in tow, I thought I'd give it a try in person.\n\nI was somewhat surprised how small it was. Luckily there was only one customer in the place, so I decided to eat there. No longer digesting crusty Dutch rolls, I went with the $7.50 Fresh Salad and had them add Salmon for $4.50 (photo: http://bit.ly/2jOEwGI). The salad part was fine with an assortment of fresh ingredients (including unexpected avocado slices) on the plate, but it went south with the salmon which was inexplicably deep-fried like it was being prepped as fish 'n chips. Luckily the balsamic dressing was on the side, so I could dip with caution. Well, at least I made good on that long-ago commitment to come here. Can't call me a slacker now.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...deep-fried salmon?\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...like a small company lunch room\nSERVICE - 3 stars...it was fast but they don't talk much\nTOTAL - 3 stars...'V' doesn't stand for 'verklempt'", "author": "Ed U."}

You know that one person that says, they have a \"quick\" question when you have a deadline to meet which then turns into a 45 minute monologue about their ingrown toe nail or how their breakfast burrito gave them the Hershey squirts this morning. \n\nYah, so yesterday was one of those days.\n\nAfter trying my best to nod and smile for 30 minutes, I had enough and politely tried to excuse myself.\n\n\"Sorry, but I have to use the restroom.\"\n\"Oh, I'll walk with you.\"\n\n\"Oh no, it's ok, I have to meet my friends for lunch right afterwards.\"\n\nAnd, these were my \"friends\" yesterday...like horny teenagers, they couldn't keep their hands (or their fins) off each other: http://bit.ly/2gFoTh0. I was like the third wheel watching them make out for the entire time I was at V Caf\u00e9 and from the looks of it, it seems like this is a common occurrence. How cute.\n\nI've only visited V Caf\u00e9 inebriated after a Thursday night at Holy Cow (next door). It's been years and it's a bit of a blur but I remember the food being quite good. \n\nOk, let's put this to the test...sober.\n\nV Cafe's menu is filled with your typical drunchies: fries, waffle fries, chili cheese fries, mozzarella sticks, buffalo wings, grilled cheese, fried chicken, fish & chips, burgers, and foot long cheese steak sandwiches. Everything is under $13. $10 minimum for CCs. There's only a handful of tables and there's even dog-friendly outdoor seating. Though...I wouldn't want to sit outside. \n\nI ordered the Half Cheese Steak Combo with salad (or fries), and choice of drink (includes bottled water) for $10.95. I added mushrooms and extra cheese for $2. \n\nThe staff is cold but they're efficient which is understandable given this is more of a late night drunchies haven. My order was ready in 5 minutes: http://bit.ly/2gSrqJh. \n\nThe hoagie roll was nicely toasted inside and out and was filled with a scalding hot mixture of thinly sliced steak, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms & onions, and lots of melty, stretchy cheese. It hit the spot since it was my first meal of the day but the flavor was off. I asked for hot peppers but this apparently translates to Huy Fong Garlic Chili Sauce here so it tasted a bit Asian to me (the cooks are Asian). The cashier didn't ask what cheese I wanted and gave me provolone by default so make sure to request a certain cheese if you want it. A half of a cheese steak is plenty but if you're going for value, then it's worth forgoing the combo and getting a whole cheese steak for $11 and save the leftovers for another meal. \n\nThe salad was fresh and topped with sliced ripen roma tomatoes, crisp cucumbers, carrots, and garbanzo beans so no complaints there. \n\nI read a lot of negative reviews for delivery. I don't understand why people order fries (or anything fried) for delivery when it's a given that it's going to arrive soggy from condensation in the box. But, hey...I've ordered $150 worth of food service at a hotel before and passed out before eating it so I'm sure they had their reasons. \n\nOverall, my meal at V Caf\u00e9 was decent but I prefer Buster's Cheese Steaks in North Beach. If I ate my meal inebriated (like I did years ago here), I wouldn't care about the off flavor from the Asian chili sauce but I hung up my dancing shoes years ago and traded it in for granny shoes.

With that said, V Cafe is great after a night out when you're not sober.\n\nTheir cheesesteaks: It might seem a little pricey for a sandwich, but keep in mind that it's a 12\" roll so the portion size is huge. Both the sweet and hot peppers are great, but definitely go with hot if you enjoy and can handle spice. My one and only gripe about V Cafe is that the bread and cheesesteak filling ratio is a little off. Some bites seem like mostly bread, so there have been a few times when I finish the cheesesteak with a fork and leave some of the bread behind. If they put a little more filling, this review would probably be 5 stars.\n\nThe garlic waffle fries are a must for anyone who loves garlic. Seriously, they don't skimp on it. It's one of those foods that makes your breath stink even after brushing your teeth. Which is absolutely worth it, unless maybe you have a date first thing in the morning after a night of drinking (but why would you do that to yourself in the first place).

I got a free soda with it, which I typically dont drink soda but figured heck, why not since its free. The popcorn shrimp were bomb! The cheesesteak was good, although it didnt seem to have extra swiss on it (considering it was an extra $1.50 for swiss i thought it would be semi-drowned). There werent enough sweet peppers in my opinion either, but there were alot of mushrooms and onions and the meat was delicious. The sandwich itself was HUGE and well worth 11.50 in my opinion. I really enjoyed my lunch today. \n\nI work nearby in the mission and did not want to go out in the rain to get lunch. The delivery was very convenient and they were impressively quick.

Sadly, I work nearby and had been in the office since 7am, up since 4:30 with no food. I was so hungry with no chance for a real lunch break in sight so I decided to yelp nearby places that delivered. V cafe popped up, and I read the reviews and decided to go for it.\n\nI ordered fried zucchini, and a mushroom Philly cheese with extra hot peppers and cheese. I was excited by the reviews and was hoping for the best, but as hungry as I was it would have been hard to disappoint....\n\n\nI'll say this. The delivery was super quick, I received my food in about 20-25 minutes and it was hot and fresh. And they followed my order instructions perfectly.\n\n I ate the zucchini first and they were not good at all. Now, I'm not sure if everyone is as particular as I am about their zucchini but this was breaded, then fried. They reminded me of mozzarella sticks from a chain restaurant. Same size, same beading, limp. If you've ever had zucchini from Carl's Jr, then this is the same exact thing, just different shape. I'm not a fan. I will not be ordering that again, and probably won't have a taste for fried zucchini for a while after that.\n\nThe Philly was on the better side of OK. It was good steak, and although I asked for extra cheese it wasn't quite extra cheesy. The thing that makes a Philly amazing to me is when the onions, peppers, steak and cheese all kinda become one amazing mix of goodness. That didn't happen with this sandwich. While it was definitely huge, and hot which I appreciated. It just didn't meet Philly steak standard of excellence. It wasn't bad, it just want VERY good.\n\nI wish I had better things to say, but I'd rather be honest. I'm not a picky eater and I'm also not that yelper who tears everything to pieces, but these items just didn't do it for me.

I haven't eaten in the actual restaurant in just about two years, but you can order online and pick the food up within 15 minutes, which is great for me because the patrons there largely consist of ogling men, so I'm always happy to be in and out. But the staff there could not be nicer. They're always hustling about, trying to get the food out as quickly as possible, but they're always smiling and they know my name, even though I'm only ever in the restaurant for 90 seconds tops.\n\nI really like the food and you're definitely getting a substantial amount of it for the price that you pay. You won't be getting any late afternoon hunger pains if you have a V Caf\u00e9 burger for lunch. Speaking of, their burgers are really juicy and tasty, the club is big with plenty of turkey stuffed inside, and the salads are so big that I can never finish a whole one (can't finish a whole salad!?!?! It probably seems like that sentence doesn't make any sense, but trust me, it does.) One thing that I don't love about the food is that I never know what my french fry situation is gonna be. They're regular fries are great. Love 'em, no complaints. But sometimes they give me waffle fries and I just want to break down and cry. Ugh, waffle fries. This isn't a carnival and I'm not five years old. NO WAFFLE FRIES, PLEASE!!!\n\nI should clarify something about the food: while I enjoy it for a work lunch every so often, this is not gourmet food we're talking about here. Don't go get a burger and then complain that Super Duper or Double Decker is waaaaay better and you can't believe how that stupid Stephenie girl on Yelp ACTUALLY likes the burgers.

It's definitely larger than a footlong. However, I don't know if it's me or what, but I have yet to find a really really cheesesteak sandwich. I loved how they used a baguette instead but the flavoring was not up to par. The peppers weren't spicy [or spicy enough] either and I think they skimped a little on the filling since I feel like I'd just get a mouthful of bread. \n\nTheir burgers look DELICIOUS and juicy though.

There aren't a lot of good lunch options in this part of SoMa but I'll be damned if this isn't one of the best. Everything I've ever gotten here has been genuinely good quality, no cut corners or skimping ever, and I've been here probably close to a hundred times by now. Sure it's greasy as hell diner food, but it's delicious and served hot, fresh and blindingly quick. One of the most efficient, fast paced kitchens I've ever seen in my life. I will say that if you order a cheesesteak and expect a \"real authentic Philly cheesesteak\" then guess what, you're going to be disappointed. It's more like a \"grilled steak sandwich on a toasted roll\", but who cares, it's good. Their salads are really good too, if you want to minimize your intake of greasy fried deliciousness.\n\nAlso the service is friendly and like everything else, super quick and efficient. Your table will sometimes get bussed and cleaned up before you're even all the way out the door. This place literally has no downsides to it, except maybe the limited seating, but the place is a hole in the wall, so it is what it is. Whenever I have no idea what I want for lunch, I usually just end up coming here because I know I won't be disappointed. Keep it up V Cafe.\n\nP.S.

The order was delivered at 2:44 PM.  At 45 minutes, the delivery time was well within the estimate of 45 to 60 minutes.  While not super speedy, I do consider delivery within 45 minutes to be relatively fast.  There was a $1 delivery fee.  The delivery person was polite and professional.\n\nOrder Minimum - The order minimum is low ($14).\n\nCheese-steak Sandwich - This was a pretty good sandwich.  The roll was nice and soft.  The meat could have been a touch more tender and it could of been a bit cheesier.  But I enjoyed it.  It was also a pretty large sandwich.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3vg2wc5\n\nBacon Cheeseburger - This was a mediocre burger.   It was cooked past the ordered medium.  I would guess the patty had been frozen.  It did had that heavy denseness that usually only comes from a frozen patty.  It was edible but that was about it.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/3fxowqy\n\nWaffle Fries - These came with the burger and were very good.  \n\nPacking  - The food was all neatly packed.\n\nPricing - The prices are inline with my expectations.  I received a free soda for ordering $20 worth of food.  This offset the delivery charge.\n\nSoda 1 $1.35 Flavor: Coke Free !\nCheese steak Sandwich 1 $7.50 \nBacon Cheeseburger 1 $7.95\nSoda 2 $1.35 Flavor: Sprite\n\nSubtotal: $19.50\n Discount: $1.35\n Tax: $1.63\n Delivery Charge: $1.00\nTotal:   $20.78 \n\nOverall - The quality was a mixed bag.  The philly was better than the burger.  The prices were decent.  I would not order from them again for  a philly or a burger though.  I can get better versions of either delivered.  I might check out some of their other menu items.  Because they do have some interesting options for delivery.  The prices were decent and delivery was relatively fast.", "author": "Mark D."}

The patty itself tasted like garbage.  The bacon was crispy but there was barely any bacon taste - just tasted like Chinese oil as another reviewer mentioned.  HOW CAN YOU NOT MAKE BACON TASTE GOOD?!?! :(  So, there went the \"protein\" part of my meal... big sadface.\n\nOn a plus - their fries were fantastic and managed to travel well, as were their onion rings.   My main issue was with the delivery guy.  He kept calling my cell phone asking for directions when I had included them in my GrubHub order.  I work in a very hard-to-miss building.  First time he called, he said he was at our door and when I went outside, he was nowhere to be found.  About 15 minutes later, I see a car outside the gate and as I go out to see if it was the guy, he drove off.  He called back, I asked if that was him, he said yes... and then another 15 minutes went by before I saw him again.  He called me several times during this time but every time I picked up to try and help him, he'd say \"Hold on\" and then would hang up.\n\nSo, yeah dealing with their incompetent delivery driver was not fun.

The wing was the size of my thumb. The wing was the sized of my other thumb. Then there were the breast and thigh.  Which wasn't much bigger.  I've never had such flavorless bland chicken. How do you mess up fried chicken? They answered that question today. I make better chicken at home.  That brings me to the criss cross fries.   Are they suppose to be stale tasting and bland. Shouldn't they be crispy at least.  The only thing barely edible was the salad. Thank you for ruing my lunch V Cafe.  The nerve of you serving that crap for $13.

Now I am fully aware that cheesesteaks in all their forms are greasy, but this was beyond the pale.  And whomever was explaining the whole fried food/chinese food connection to the burgers, can also make the connection w/ the steak samiches.  There is just this old wok oil flavour that accompanies the food.  And the mozzarella sticks were sub-par.  They were soggy and sitting in marinara sauce.
