This place is not fine dining. But for a Korean spot in a food court, Sorabol is actually quite good. \n\nSorabol is located on the ground floor of Westfield. There are many Asian fast food spots within the mall, many of which are right next to Sorabol, so it faces stiff competition from other vendors. I was intrigued by this spot from the start because you don't see Korean fast food too often. The line at this place was also noticeably longer than others.\n\nThe \"plates\" are cheap and filling. I got the Lemon Chicken plate. It came with rice, Korean noodles, kimchi, broccoli, and a large portion of chicken. While decent, the lemon chicken did not strike me as authentic. It actually reminded me of the orange chicken they serve at Panda Express. Next time upgrading for $1 to the bulgogi or spicy pork is probably worth it.\n\nPro tip: when they ask you if you're eating there or taking the food to go, say you're taking it to go. They will use a plate if you're eating there, and a  plastic food container if you're taking it to go. The latter will give you  1.25x - 1.50x more quantity.", "author": "Chris W."}

I have gotten the Spicy BBQ Chicken and the Bulgogi. They both come with rice, broccoli, noodles, and kimchi. \n\nSpicy BBQ Chicken- Super spicy and super flavorful. Even though the chicken may be a little dry, it still tastes amazing. The flavor is amazing. It is actually pretty spicy, so get your water ready! \n\nBulgogi- Super tender and delicious.

Generous portions of meat whose excessive seasoning compensates for the fact that it's being scooped to order (instead of cooked to order).  It is fine for a quick fix.\n\nBBQ Short Rib: It's no wonder these are priced at a premium, they're one of the tastier items offered.  Like something you'd get at a Korean BBQ joint, except if it spent 30 minutes under a heat lamp after being cooked.  Same great taste, but some of the fresh-off-the-grill crispiness was missing.\n\nBulgogie Beef: Huge portion of medium-thin meat heavy on the marinade.  I'm used to bulgogi being thinner and more seared, but the marinade and well-done cooking made it good enough for a food court approximation.\n\nNoodles: Didn't waste my time on the rice and went full-on on japchae.  Might as well get a type of noodle not offered by the other Asian food court stands.  Tasty enough.", "author": "Adam B."}

It's a pretty difficult meal to swallow. You'd need a lot of water to go with this. I purchased an aloe drink, but that was not enough.\n\nIt's a system where you go down the line and point at what you want. At the end, I was asked whether I wanted kimchi or not. Of course I did. At that same place where the kimchi was at, they have a whole section of banchan that was completely full and untouched. Strange.\n\nI asked if I was able to get some banchan and the guy shook his head and said, \"No.\" So I asked, \"Really? Then what is the banchan for?\" He shook his head some more. I asked, \"What can I order on the menu that I can get some banchan?\" He shook his head and passed my order to the lady to his right. I added in a final, \"Can I purchase banchan as a side?\" He ignored me and moved on to the next person. Seriously? Why have banchan on display if you're not going to sell it? If you're too cheap to give it for free like normal Korean places, then sell it. I was willing to pay and even offered. So ridiculous. Are you just going to leave the banchan to go to waste?\n\nThe lady wrapped up my order, totaled it up, and was passing it to the cashier.

This time, nobody cock-blocked me but perhaps someone should have.  Sorabol is not quite \"horabal\" (say it aloud) but it seems to be well on its way.\n\nWhat happened?  When did Sorabol jump the shark?  \n\nI once recommended this Sorabol over the one in Yerba Buena Center but now I'd not recommend either.  The BBQ Chicken Plate ($8.95), while cheap and ample, was a sea of mediocrity.  Sorabol seems to be trading in inferior product produced without care and with little regards to taste.  And they've become so miserly stingy with their kimchi - the one thing that could've rescued this meal - that it almost made me laugh.  Almost.\n\nWhat Sorabol lacked in Kimchi generosity they more than made up for with the rest of the platter.  White rice was supplemented with a mound of cellphane yam noodles, a stack of icy cold (why icy cold?) broccoli and carrots, and a ridiculously large portion of something they called BBQ chicken.  This was like the old trope \"it wasn't very good but there sure was a lot of it\".  The serving of chicken was far more than I've ever received in past visits but it tasted like anything but BBQ.  No char marks and absolutely nothing special about it.  The same could be said about the rest of the plate's ingredients.\n\nSorabol received a 74/100 on their most recent Health Department inspection.  That score isn't enough to send me running but it's poor enough to remind of a similar score at another once-decent-now-gone place.  It just feels like they've given up trying to produce good food with quality ingredients.  There was a muddled lack of flavor to the whole meal.  \n\nI'm not kidding when I say that a reasonable sized serving of kimchi could've worked miracles here.  Westfield's food court is big and I'd not sat anywhere near Sorabol.  By the time I realized how little kimchi I'd been given I opted not to go back and beg for more.  What I was left with was dry, meek, and uninteresting.\n\nIf you insist on coming to Sorabol I won't try to dissuade you but I will warn you:  as you move through that line pay careful attention to the kimchi portion and then keep saying \"more please\" until you can envision yourself being satisfied.  It'll probably take quite a lot to achieve.", "author": "Tracey A."}

That's not to be unexpected when you're dealing with food court culture in a mall. And my review today may not have been  any different. But instead of ordering what the majority of the folks ordered, I ordered the fried rice with kimchi and spicy chicken. Now, normally this dish is not made with the spicy chicken, but they did it for me. \n\nI have to tell you, that was some of the best fried rice I've ever had. The spicy sauce from the chicken, along with kimchi really added great flavor to the rice. The other thing to note here is that this dish is somewhat custom and has to be prepared. So you have to wait about 8-10 minutes. I think this add to the distinction of this dish versus the standard orders that most people place.

They do take credit cards if you don't carry much cash.\n\nBecause of that situation we had to bring the food back to hotel to eat. The tables there were all taken up by people from the celebration. And it was jam packed!!!\n\nWe all ordered pretty much the same. Korean shortrib,\nBBQ chicken, broccoli, rice and japchae. My HB did ask for Kim chee too. That actually made the food tasty. I loved the japchae which is this clear tan color noodle with green onion and sliced carrots. The shortrib tasted good but better to eat it right away or it's cold. It was a bit gristly. The BBQ chicken was not really too flavorful. Maybe better to get the spicy chicken?  I can't really handle too spicy foods so I didn't want to take a chance.

They need to calm down on the sweetness of their food.  Their potstickers are heard and thick and flavorless.\n\nThe item to get here, though, is the stir fry noodles with either chicken or shrimp.  I order shrimp.  Sometimes they use a handful of small-medium shrimp (peeled with no tails) and sometimes they use 4 or 5 medium, tail-on shrimp.  Great value at like $9-something and it's made fresh instead of scooped from a steam table so it's nice and hot.  You order it and pay and then a few minutes later they scream \"stir fry nood-oh!\".

This location can be found at Westfield's stylish and hopping food court.  It's a nice concept: affordable Korean BBQ, noodles, and banchan served up quick in a casual setting.  They've got an open, flame grill behind the counter, where you can see the beef, chicken, and pork being freshly cooked.  It smells delicious.\n\nThe restaurant serves Korean BBQ chicken (dak bulgogi), beef bulgogi, and pork bulgogi (dwaeji bulgogi).  They also have beef short ribs (galbi), seafood (mackerel, salmon, calamari), and an assortment of noodle, wonton, and tofu soups.  Entrees are reasonably priced at around $10 each.  The quality isn't great, but the portions are big and for a food court meal, you'll walk away feeling satisfied.\n\nMost of the foods have already been cooked and are sitting in a cafeteria-style ordering line.  Plates start off with white rice and japchae noodles (slippery, translucent Korean sweet potato noodles) followed by meat(s).  I tried and suggest the beef bulgogi and short ribs.\n\nAt the end of the line, they throw some sauce onto the rice, give you a small cup of kimchi, and top the plate off with a few pieces of broccoli.  There's also a selection of a dozen different types of banchan (complementary Korean side dishes).  Unlike a sit-down Korean restaurant, the banchan at Sorabol is not included with your meal.  It costs extra.  The banchan consists of different vegetables, mostly pickled.\n\nMy plate of beef bulgogi and short ribs hit the spot.  I've rarely had galbi (short ribs) that didn't taste good.  It's just one of those dishes that's apparently hard to mess up.  Galbi is served on the bone and is easier eaten with your hands.  Therefore, you may want to grab extra napkins.  The bulgogi was savory, soft and well marinated.\n\nI recommend asking for just noodles instead of rice *and* noodles.  The japchae noodles are more appetizing and unique.  The kimchi is savory, but served in small portions.\n\nService is speedy.  Large glasses of water are available free of charge.  Silverware is self-serve and is located around the corner from the register.\n\nI think Sorabol is one of the most popular (if not, the most popular) restaurant at Westfield's food court.", "author": "Daniel B."}

The majority of the plates are ready to go with the meats pre-cooked. With these dishes, you get the option of white rice, noodles, or both, and then they add your choice meats. Personally, I really like their clear noodles so i just for all noodles but it's nice to have options! they also ask if you would like kimchi and add a few broccoli to finish up the dish but it's really not that much veggies. Basically, it's rice/noodles plus meat. The portion size is very reasonable considering what you pay. The only downside is that there is not that much variety in a single dish (even if you get the combo plate with two meats). I just happened to go with my friend and we each ordered separate dishes and split them, which was a good way to make up for the lack of variety.

And either nobody bothered to do a taste test, or they simply didn't care. I didn't bother go back and get in line to complain because otherwise I would have missed the movie.\n\nDear Sorabol,\nPlease establish some quality control procedures. If you run out of something then please just offer a substitute (out of fried rice or noodles = offer white rice or maybe extra veggies instead), until the next batch is ready (properly cooked!!).

After a moment she carried her bowl back to the counter; apparently it was the wrong dish. They handed her a new bowl and she went away. \n\nSo I approached the counter, pointed to the bowl she had brought back, and asked, \"Was that my dish?\" The guy behind the counter picked it up and said yes, it is, here you go, and started to hand it to me. \n\nUm, no. \n\n\"You served that to her and she started to eat it and then brought it back. I don't want that, thank you.\" The guy looked a little surprised - I can't imagine why - and there was a brief huddle with a cook, who then bustled about to heat the noodles and vegetables while I wondered whether to just walk away. But what the heck, they were making a new dish, I had paid already, so I decided just to go with it.. \"Sorry\", the guy said, as he handed me the new dish. \n\nI had, of course, already resolved never to return, no matter how good the food might be; that was just stunningly weird, and probably broke a health code or two. \n\nAnd then I tried the food: Spring roll, crispy but greasy. Broccoli, barely warmed and practically freezing at the core. Noodles, gummy and in several places stuck together in clumps of a dozen or more, and covered thickly in a sickly sweet gummy brown sauce. \n\nEnough - I bused my dish (this is a food court, after all) and got a sandwich from Bristol Farms.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-12", "description": "I know what you are thinking. Is this guy seriously going to send me to a food court in a shopping mall for some interesting Asian food? Yes, that's the plan.\n\nMall food courts usually have the obligatory Sbarro and the Subway that is also appearing even more frequently than Starbucks these days. So, one can be assured that the food will be the lowest common denominator of food. It will be bland enough that it won't offend any palette. Heaven forbid a bold flavor shake anyone up. Keep it simple and boring and our Walmart culture won't be put off by the food.\n\nThat is why Sorabol is such a find at the Westfield Centre. I've grabbed a quick bite there on a few occasions and been pleasantly surprised by the bold flavors and fresh ingredients. The spicy beef soup actually is spicy and painfully delish! The housemade kimchee they provide with it adds a nice added kick as well. \n\nThe spicy calamari comes in a very bold sauce served with glass rice noodles and rice. It's actually quite a meal and, though the flavor is fantastic, I haven't actually finished one yet. This is fresh calamari in a sizzling great sauce. There's no breading, no dip. This isn't a pub appetizer. It's a very pleasing seafood dish.\n\nTo set expectations, you will stand in line and your food will be given to you on a plastic tray. If you need someone in a black mock turtleneck to give you your Asian fare with a little attitude, then just head on over to the Slanted Door in the Ferry Building. The food court is not going to do it for you. If you do decide to stay at Sorabol, you will collect your tray of goodness and then wander around looking for someplace to sit in the busy food court. But, the flavors will be worth it. You'll sit there thinking, \"Am I really eating this in a mall?\"\n\nHaving recently eaten at a big deal Tyler Florence restaurant with a big deal price tag, I can tell you that I honestly enjoyed the bite I had at Sorabol the following week much more than anything I tasted at Tyler's place. \n\nIf you are in the city and looking for a quick, interesting and affordable bite, I recommend Sorabal.

They do give a good portion but what I hate is a lot of the dishes are very greasy. If you're really craving Korean you might be okay with it, but otherwise it's not worth it.

The line was huge, so I figured they must be doing something right. \n\nThey have a big steam table with all sorts of options. We decided to split the 2-item combination plate, which comes with rice, jap chae (clear noodles), and literally 3 pieces of broccoli. We chose the BBQ beef ribs and chicken. We only got one rib and one piece of chicken that was burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside. The rib was really fatty and rubbery. \n\nThey do have a clear plastic box full of little cups of kimchi which you can help yourself to, but it didn't taste right. Kind of bland, maybe?

Very tough competition.  I think that the other restaurants are just a bit too chic.  Sorabol is like a taste of your more ghetto, less shiny mall at home (in my case, Newpark, which used to have a Sorabol).\n\n2 - For 8 bucks, you get a HUGE portion of rice, chap chae and some meat.  And, best of all, UNLIMITED kim chee.  Well, you're probably supposed to only take one...but PFFT, self-serve = unlimited.  I usually ask for double chap chae because I think it's actually some of the best I've had - greasy, but not TOO greasy.  \n\n3 - Granted this isn't Brothers or Han Il.  But, you're paying a fraction of the cost for a good, solid meal that provides enough energy for a few more hours of shopping and doesn't make your tummy hurt.  The chicken is pretty tender and they don't overdoes the sauce.  I like that it comes with broccoli because it makes me feel like I'm eating \"healthily\".  I've also had the fish ball soup - again, a HUGE serving with tasty broth.  Not such a fan of the thicker noodles though.\n\nSo, in conclusion...this place is a great alternative to some of the other stuff in SOMA.

The food every time looked good and fresh and every time that I came here passed by they had someone giving out samples previously.

So I went with that and I don't know if it was just me but the lemon chicken was quite spicy. But at the same time I thought I was eating generals chicken. Whatever,so I got egg rolls and I thought they tasted ok and the rest of my order consisted of white rice and broccoli. \n\nThe food overall was quite pleasing unlike my last experience was just a little sadden by my hard broccoli.

Usually located in malls, every time I've eaten at one, all I've gotten was over-cooked meat. So no thank you is what I kept saying every time I visited the food court in the Westfield Center. However the past few times I came to Westfield with friends, they all ordered Sorabol, which I got to sneak bites of. Of course my first reaction was: this Sorabol can't be a Sorabol. No really. I'm serious. There is no way because the K-food here is hecka good for a Sorabol. Still in denial over it all, it's taken me about a month to write a review. I guess I'm finally coming to terms with it all.\n\nThis Sorabol serves up terrific Korean classics like kalbi, dak gui, kimchi for the hungry masses that descend upon the lower level of the Westfield  during lunch and dinner time. I ordered short rib stew special that came with a large pile of steamed broccoli, rice and chapchae. Damn that was good. \n\nTheir portions were huge but still pricey at around $10 a pop. I'm not even gonna pretend like this is authentic good Korean food and insult all the Koreans out there reading this post, but damn it's great K-fast food. I kinda sympathize with Sorabol haters because as much as I hate and boycott PF Chang's for their complete bastardization of Chinese food, I still go to Panda Express for their yummy orange chicken. I am a complex woman with hypocritical food tastes. So sue me.\n\nOther cool tidbits about this place is that they offer a self-serve pre-packed kimchi, the menu also includes soups and noodles, and even alternatives to the combo plate such as Bowls.  In comparison to my local Sorabol, this place is totaly different; they offer a large heaping pile of broccoli standard and provide huge portions (the Sorabol at the local mall doesn't). So how do I reconcile the disparity? I can't. All I know is that the smell of grilled meat at Sorabol will probably get me again next time I'm in the Westfield food court.", "author": "Dawn L."}

So the hope is one thing, and the need is another. That much is established. \n\nOn one end, one accepts piss poor service and less than adequate \"authentic-er shit\" or moderately adequate mall food. Applying the aforementioned philosophy of social separation to food helps when one has a craving for, let's call this Korean Food for now. \n\nModerately tasty and sufficiently filling, this place doesn't claim to be fine dining or supremely authentic. It's just fine and dandy Korean plate food with the options of fried rice and... did I see orange chicken? BBQ chicken is hard to fuck up and so are short ribs. The chapchae is actually better than some of the other attempts I've tried in the area (which have all been largely disappointing - so Sorabol being approximately average/adequate is kind of a big deal) and surprisingly okay kim chee. Expedient service in the shitbox that's the mall is always appreciated. \n\nPerfectly acceptable on all fronts. All that considered, mall food it remains.\n\nSo, until some really ass-kickin' Korea-ville eats come in and stomp out the Cocobangs and the Sorabols of the town, I'll continue treating the two as separate beings, lest the Governators and the Mr. Lopezes of my life start hanging out and shooting the shit about who knows what.", "author": "Roy M."}

For around 8 bucks, you can get rice, noodles, veggies, kimchi and grilled meat enough for two meals.  \n\nI almost always get just chapchae and bbq chicken when I'm picking up lunch at the mall.  The food is flavorful, plentiful and thanks to the fast turnover, quite fresh. \n\nSo it's not anything exotic or  \"authentic\" (however people define authentic Korean), but neither am I and people still like me.   \n\nIt is what it is. You're not getting a formal Korean sit down meal with 45 banchans and the \"authentic\" (aka abusive) Korean service .  This is essentially \"fast food\" where you can be in and out with your food in 5 minutes.  Adjust your expectations and I think you'll be pleased.\n\nNote:  if you choose to order lemon chicken at a Korean joint, please do not complain that it's not good - you have only you to blame.", "author": "mia s."}

I am usually both, but even I was still having a hard time finishign the food.\n\nThe korean barbecue beef was pretty good, cheap quality (some stringiness and fat), but it was a low percentage. The flavor was good and it had just the right amount of green and regular onion mixed in. I've had bad experiences with chicken in MOST Korean restaurants I've been to, but it actually wasn't too bad at Sorabol, a bit undercooked (it wasn't raw at all, but it could be cooked a bit longer, but not to the point of dryness). The clear noodles side dish is also good. It's not as bland as some people have made it out, in my opinion. The complimentary tiny cups of kim chee is really nice. \n\nAdditionally, I love that they give you a huge cup if you ask for water. I mean, it's just tap water with ice - why do most places still try to stinge you on it and give you tiny little Dixie cups? Why, God, why??\n\nFinally, +50 stars because the man who works the registers there is the man I want to have my babies with.

It's this last part ... the \"should I decide to cook it myself\" that seems to be my biggest problem.  \n\nThere are so many components to making a Korean meal \"authentic\", that creating a homemade meal can take hours or even days to do right.

So this is not based off of a single visit. But my visits have diminished over the last year because of the points noted below. \n\nLets get down to brass tacks here. \n\nFood is tasty. Love the flavors of the BBQ chicken and the short ribs. (And when they had them the steamed dumplings). \n\nThe wife loves the soup.\n\nBut 2 major bummers about this place... Well maybe 3.\n1. They no longer sell steamed dumplings, just fried. Hello! This is SF, lets keep it healthy (at least as healthy as Pork filled carbs can be)\n2. Portions are hit and miss: sometimes I get loaded up and can't finish. Other times, my 4 year old can polish off the whole thing and want more. And to be clear I am saying that sometimes they give 1 set of ribs, sometimes 2. And the amount of chicken ranges from \"covers the plate\" to '  \"I've seen more real chicken in a McNugget\"\n\nI have complained about the inconsistencies before and I just get told food is pricey so they have to cut back. But that doesn't explain the inconsistencies ... and I can do math. They are making out just fine when even they load up the plate. \n\nAnd if I had to throw in a 3rd issue that triggers me... the service. Not of the line staff, they are always great. And I suspect I get more food when they are there on their own. But when the manager (owner?) is there, forget it. And he is the one who has cried poor mouth when I have inquired as to why the amount of food varies.\n\nNow that I think about it, in prior visits following the removal of the steamed dumplings from the serving line, when I have asked for them they have run in back and grabbed me a few. But not the last time because the manager (owner?) said no.\n\nWhile I'll keep going there occasionally because my kid likes the food. I will go less frequently.

Mall food!\n\nWe paced ourselves around the bustiling food court downstairs and man, was it crowded for a Friday night! :P It t'was the first friday night of opening, but still... I expected more people!\n\nAfter meandering the court for 1 loop, we looked for \"Out the door\" (1 of my favorite places to eat at the Ferry Building, and 1 of the places I wanted my SO to try out).. but it hadn't open yet!! Grrr for slow construction!\n\nAnyways, we settled for Korean food because that was the only thing that looked decent and quick, so we found a seat and I waited in line.. me, myself and 30 other people. \n\nThere was no menu, but I was already familiar with their food from another restaurant in the Rincon Center near my workplace, so I was expecting nothing less than crappy food for an overpriced  price. \n\nMe2Myself: \"Great! I'm waiting in line here in line and I already know the food will be bad. Where is the prices so I know how much it cost?... I need to pee.\"\n\nAs I got closer to the warm food tray counter (great, another mew thing to look at) I was like.. \n\nMe2Myself: \"Stop poking me with your damn Bloomingdales Yellow bag little Asian girl with long eyelashes which are sooooo fake!\"\n\n\"Oh.. a Menu!\" I exclaimed! I reached out and grabbed for the single leaflet menu, only to be disappointed by the food choices. \n\nBBQ CHICKEN\nSPICY BBQ CHICKEN\nBBQ SHORT RIBS\nPORK\nSPICY PORK\n\nEach of these items come with rice, or noodles (ask for half and half) some veggies and some kimchi (more on that later). \n\nAfter little miss bratz had her way with the employee getting her her food, it was my turn. I asked for two bowls of Rice + Noodles, and spicy pork.\n\nTallAsianGuyLookingLikeHeBeenDrinkingLastNight: \"Sorry sir, we don't have spicy pork. How about chicken?\"\n\nMe2Him: \"Do you have any Short Ribs\"\n\n\nTallAsianGuyLookingLikeHeBeenDrinkingLastNight looks at me like I'm from Mars that I do not see it in front of me and says: \"We don't have that either, but we have CHICKEN! Its really good.\" He points to the buckload of bbq chicken.\n\nMe: \"Fine. I'll get the chicken and spicy chicken on each bowl.\"\n\nSomehow they mixed that order up and gave me 2 regular and 1 spicy chicken in one bowl and 3 spicy chicken in another. \n\nFinally got to the \"sauce lady\" and sure enough.. more questions.\n\nSauceLady in a low tone as if she was whispering: \"Do you want veggies and sauce?\"\n\nMe: \"what did you say? Its too loud in here..\"\n\nSauceLady: \"Veggies and sauce?\" She then points to both items as if I am a foreigner and I just give her the nod of the head. (isn't that a universal sign to know)\n\nFinally got to the counter after getting nailed in the leg by Little Ms Bratz and her yellow bag and picked up a diet coke and a water. Granted, the person that rung me up didn't take into account that I had a bowl (50 cents extra by the way) . It should have been somewhere in the price range of $25 for all this, but he only counted me $18.88. \n\nGuess he saw I was Chinese.\n\nAnyways, he gave me two small sample of kimchee and finally got the food to the table.. 25 mins of wait.. \n\nWe started eating in the high quality bowls and MAN! The flavor was off the hook! The spicy sauce actually tasted SPICY and almost comparable to say Brothers. The chicken was good and tasty with NO skin (just the way I like it)\n\nThe portions were decent and the noodles tasted right. I'm glad they did cooked things right on the first day.  The veggies was just broccoli, so nothing to write home about. I'm just glad that I finally had decent Korean BBQ food vs that nasty place with a similar name in the Rincon center.\n\nMoney saving tip: I think if you get a bowl, you'll get more food.. but I could be totally wrong there!", "author": "Wilson L."}

So its not the best or most authentic Korean food out there, but for shits sake, its in a\" food emporium.\"  They do a fairly good job of getting some decent charbroiled flavor in the chicken, though I have to say that their sauce was sickly sweet.  Thankfully they do offer kimchee in small plastic containers- I wasn't sure if I was allowed to take two, but I did anyway.  The tangy spiciness of the kimchee works wonders on counteracting the sweetness of the chicken.  The clear noodles were a little too al dente for my taste and didn't have enough sesame flavor.  Steamed broccoli was steamed broccoli...not much to say about that.\n\nOverall, a fairly good eat in the Westfield Mall especially if you're sick of the typical Chinese takeout.  I'd say get your order to go since they really pile on the meat and broccoli in the takeout containers, whereas they seem to put less on orders to eat in.  I just noticed I had way more chicken in my to-go order than the people around me who were eating at the mall.

The quality of Korean food could be a lot better, but give me a break. I'd venture to guess that this place serves 400+ people a day. It's easily the most popular fast food spot in the food court. You cannot go wrong with the BBQ Chicken if you want a really fast hearty meal. They give you some Broccoli, glass noodles, rice and the BBQ chicken covered with Teriyaki Sauce \"If you want some!\" Nod yes! For something under $10 dollars and will undoubtedly make you full, there isn't a better value in this expensive food court. The BBQ Short Ribs are incredible as well if you feel like treating yourself on a friday. and there is a buffet of other choices that you can create a mix and match combo with at Sorabol.", "author": "Michael C."}

The first tip-off should have been the lack of food knowledge. A sign on the counter said \"Spicy Tofu Stew\", and when I ordered the \"Soondooboo\" they told me they didn't make it...Okay, explained that it was the stew that I wanted, then asked if it comes with banchan. They had no idea what I was talking about. This is when I should have left and ran across the street for some tofu banh mi from Cafe Dolci. But I stayed, ordered banchan (the \"salad plate\") on the side and waited for my soondooboo. \n\nShort recap - the broth was ok, pretty spicy. But the makeup of the soup just wasn't what I'm used to. It was more like broth with tofu chunks than a tofu stew. There wasn't any cabbage or other greens in it, and it there were various kinds of seafood mixed into it (which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it wasn't noted that it came with seafood. I like mine without.) The banchan all tasted the same, though the kimchi was pretty good. \n\nI probably won't be coming here again, and I almost feel like I should run to Bowl'd in Albany to get the taste of good Korean back into my mind.", "author": "Lauren M."}

But that's how it was opening day at Sorabol, Korean BBQ, in the new San Francisco Westfield food court. We went for lunch, about 1 p.m. on Sept. 28. Frankly, Gieson and I picked Sorabol because it was the shortest line (who knew Buckhorn was soo popular), and we were right because it took a max of 10 minutes to pay and get the food. Nevermind that we didn't know what we were getting besides Korean BBQ.\n\nSo, when we got to pay, we found out there was only one thing on the menu: a BBQ chicken meal with rice, brocolli and kimchi for $7.50. Sodas, $1.\n\nThe result: Normal food court food. Nothing spectacular, but a good place to refuel. The chicken was cooked well; it wasn't dry. And the kimchi was tame enough for me (I pass on the hot sauce at Taco Bell).\n\nThe food court seating is a step above other malls. The bambo plants on each table add a nice touch, as the loungelike seating near Beard Papa's. Off course, on opening day it was too crowded to enjoy it all. Overall, Sorabol was efficient, servicewise and foodwise.", "author": "rosanna c."}

Oh, it's not very authentic, at all, and they don't know how to cook their rice properly, it's always too mushy... and Koreans don't eat Japchae with every meal. Broccoli is a fairly recent trend in imported vegetables in Korean cuisine. Oh, and Mapo Tofu isn't even Korean, it's Chinese, and green peas never really caught on in Korean cuisine, aside from the fact that a Korean person would not consume soft tofu in a sauce, it would be in a stew as a main ingredient. And no one in Asia uses that much sugar in their soups and marinades. This place is a lie!", "author": "Y K."}

Sorabol is consistently delicious for it being \"fast food\". However, having had sorabol in the LA area more often, I'd have to say this SF one does not taste as good as its sister branches. The portions were extremely generous, but the chap chae was bland and this particular sb did not give me the option of picking my pickles/vegetables (my favorite part of the dish!). Most of the time, they will just give you steamed broccoli with whatever meat you order. In order to get their legit pickles, you'd have to order a side \"salad\" dish for another ~$7. This sorabol is also a bit pricey ($8-$12 per dish) and did not give you as much flexibility as other sb's.", "author": "Kasey N."}

In line at Sorabol, I contemplated \"just short ribs or pay another dollar for a second item?\"  I concluded, \"What the heck, my ribs could use a sick-kick.\"  I walked up to the woman, told her I wanted two items: short ribs and salmon.  She filled up my plate with rice, ONE PIECE of short rib, three sad pieces of dry salmon, and a crapload of broccolis and lemons.  My first thought to myself was \"You're such a fat pig, why do you need to eat so much anyway?\"  Then my glutton self got angry; I've been a patron here a ton of times before and I know they usually give you substantially more.  This is not right to try to gyp me.  \n\nI asked the woman \"Can you give me another piece of the short rib?\"  She looked perplexed and walked back to the short ribs.  She took the piece that she had placed on my plate BACK and picked up another, asking \"Is this piece fine?\"  She thought I had wanted to switch the pieces!  A line of five parties had formed behind me.  I would have to be a real jerk to argue with this woman or cancel my order.  I said, \"Forget it,\" and thought \"I'll just pay for this and never show my face here again.\"  Despite the fact that they charge you up the butt, I still could have respected if they had admitted the truth, which is that the economy isn't doing too well and they need to make up for losses somehow.  Even if I haven't eaten my meal with bitterness, the salmon still would have been hard and dry.  It's MALL food, where you lacked in quality, you could at least try to make up with quantity, but no.

But let's face it, when you date or marry an Asian man, you need to learn to love it.   Seriously.  Also, my mother only served us white meat chicken when I was growing up.  But let's face it, when you date or marry an Asian man, you need to learn to eat some sketchy cuts of chicken, or you won't eat at all (especially at the divey places in the Sunset).  Anywhoo, the spicy chicken rice plate at Sorabol is pretty good.  It comes with chicken, rice, an ENORMOUS helping of glass noodles, and some steamed broccoli.  Naturally, the meat is often chewy (gristly) albeit plentiful.  It's all about quantity over quality here at Sorabol Korean Restaurant.", "author": "Poker B."}

It's really good. Kimchi is \"comp\", and you can get two cups of it. I sometimes order the seaweed on the side, or the sweetened anchovies (not sure actually if those are anchovies). Taste is good.\n\nThe only problem, as you may have noticed from the other reviews , is that the servings are TOO LARGE. Not human size at all. Quite pricey too for a food court-type of restaurant. I don't think you can spend less than $12 at this place. Ok, huge servings, so big bill: makes sense. But I just wish they could trim down the serving as well as the bill. Sure you can share the food with your friend and split the bill, but that's not always convenient, especially when you have different picks from the menu. \n\nBut service is definitely quick.", "author": "Ryan M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-16", "description": "Ok I'm going to 'fess to eating at this chain and liking it. Especially the Sorabol in Tanforan Center. Tops. The one at Stonestown? Not good. Flavorless. Which considering it's Korean food, is very weird to taste. It's all about the marinades and spices and they somehow lack it.\n\nThe Westfield Centre location one is great comparatively. The menu is very much limited, just basic chicken, pork and beef dishes. And then there are the noodle and soup dishes. We tried the rice plates. BBQ chicken, spicy pork and short ribs. The portions were just right. BBQ chicken was juicy without being underdone. The spicy pork was actually spicy. Which for mall food is an amazing thing. So many vendors think that customers don't actually want it to be spicy hot when that is 'the' description. I mean I know there are people that dumb who will complain 'Hey, that was too spicy!' Well, duh. that's why they call it 'spicy pork'. The short ribs were decent. The sides chosen were chap chae (sesame bean thread noodles) and bean sprouts. Tasty. The kimchee was not bad either. Though I always wonder why they give it out in such tiny little paper cups. I mean unless you truly love kim chee, a little bit will do you very nicely. It's just when you see how tiny the cups are, it makes you think 'cheap'. Nothing wrong with that. Just an impression.\n\nThe line to this place is pretty long but it's constantly moving and also this means that the food doesn't sit around for very long on the steam table. The line is also long because I think that when people get a look at the plates and bowls leaving the counter, it has immediate eye appeal. \n\nThe prices to this location seem to be about a dollar more than the one's I've been to. But considering that it's downtown, it's priced competitively.\n\n****3.8.07 So I've eaten here quite a few times now. The menu has gotten a bit larger. They've added calamari, salmon, lamb and noodle soups. The noodle soups are my new favorite thing! A large bowl of noodle with carrots, cabbage, bean sprouts, green onions and a main ingredient of your choosing. Chicken, beef, fish ball, won ton, seafood and a couple others are listed. It's tasty without being overwhelming. If you want to add a little more something to your noodles, dump a bit of the kim chee into the bowl. That'll spice it up nicely.", "author": "cyndi L."}

I tried the bbq chicken, and it was so bad that I ended up walking away after 3 bites.  The chicken was dry, cold and tasteless, the brocoli was overcooked, the rice was the best thing on my plate even though it was cold also.  Service was awful (\"What you want?\").  I will eat somewhere else in the future.", "author": "Marijke D."}

And this was for the 1 item entree order. Basically it is three times the servings of any of the Out the Door items. The food is pretty good and very satisfying. Oh yea, not that I care, but they don't use MSG either.", "author": "Mama L."}

I'd always known that the food court at the mall had a Korean BBQ place, but Sorabol took my expectations and blew them away.  MASSIVE quantities of kalbi, plus rice and japchae and broccoli for 9.71$?  We're talking a TON of meat.  I came here 3 days for lunch in one week, I was so in love with the place.  Thank god I don't live close to here, otherwise I'd literally be coming here every single day.  They even take credit card!", "author": "emilie k."}

Me and my LL always go here or Panda Express even when there are so many other places to go in the city. It's just sometimes, you gotta go semi-fast food. The glass noodles at Sorabol -- the bomb! And the Kalbi -- wicked awesome! Need I say more?", "author": "Michelle R."}

The line can be long at times, but moves very quickly as long as there aren't any cell phone idiots in front of you who can't decide what they want.  The food is fresh and doesn't have time to sit and get stale.  I always order either the spicy barbeque chicken or the grilled chicken.  You get rice and clear noodles as well, but I always stick with the noodles.  Plus they give you some nice, crunchy green broccoli with a tasty light sauce.  You order potstickers individually, so I usually get 2-3.  With a soft drink I'm usually in the $10-1$12 range.  The service is friendly  and fast, they move you right along.  Steve, the manager, is a nice gent who recognizes if you're a regular, so he makes sure you get big portions and good deals.   I work nearby and go there 2-3 times a week.  I wish there was one in Lafayette, too!  If you're hungry and find yourself at Westfield, I recommend Sorabol very much.", "author": "Richard G. P."}
