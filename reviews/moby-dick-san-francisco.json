Your classic dive bar - dark and old looking, as if nothing has changed since they first opened the doors. Overall a really fun environment and seemingly an institution in the neighborhood of Castro. As we were leaving they were setting up for a drag show.\n\nBeware that you will not get phone service in this bar, at least not if you have Verizon like I do.", "author": "Bri T."}

Trying to compete with other bars isn't really working out. Moby attracts a very heavy drinking crowd of regulars. Why not just cater to that kind of crowd if that's who your customers are. Instead they have re-tread go-go boys and the absolute worst drag show in SF that has been grinding on for years. They might be trying to intentionally be bad in an ironic sort of way, if so no one is in on it. The bartenders are great especially the Colt calendar man in the daytime and the man at night Patrick. They almost know what you're drinking before you sit down. I don't know where they hire their bar backs but the one thundering though the last few times I was there seemed to be off his medication.", "author": "Joe B."}

Since the bar is neither a Whale nor white, I instead will describe Moby Dick in terms of Herman Melville himself.  \n\nMelville is not the best way to spend a Saturday night.  And neither is Moby Dick\n\nMelville wrote one of the most famous lines in English literature: \"Call Me Ishmael.\"  Moby Dick certain seems to be one of the most famous bars in the Castro.  And that's sort of how it goes here, friendly guys tossing out their names.\n\nMelville likes to go on tangents and digressions about mutinies and naval history.  Moby Dick is just one of those digressions.  Wait, how did I get here?  Shoot, I need to get back to the plot.\n\nMelville was a man's man.  He was no Jack London, but shit, who is?  The guys here aren't queens or muscle gods or club kids, but guy's guys. Have you seen the pool table?\n\nMelville made famous good ol' Bartleby who preferred not to do things quite a lot.  Cue a patron at Moby Dick asking for my phone number.  \"I'd prefer not to.\"\n\nMeville wrote Billy Budd.  And come on, that fresh faced cutie was only $100 dollars from appearing on Sean Cody.\n\nMelville like Moby Dick is probably good for you (they tend to have decent drink specials and strong pours), but usually the eyes crave something a little more exciting.", "author": "Jeremy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-26", "description": "After writing my review, the owner of Moby Dick responded, in private email, from his owner verified yelp account,  in defense. I should note that in all my years of Yelping establishments, no owner of a business has ever responded in such a poor, unprofessional demeanor. Just goes to show that some people aren't really fit for business. Anyway, I visited Moby Dick last night and noticed one of the other purple stripped fish swimming while rubbing its underbelly on the gravel below, then floating on the top of the water half the night as if it was dead, and suddenly spazzing around in circles. Seems like someone needs to upgrade their filter and check the ammonia levels in the water.\n\nHere are his responses:\nReally do you really think we switched fish to fool people? The only time put new fish in the tank is when one dies, which is very rare. I'm sorry about the cover charge on Wednesday nights, but the bar does not receive any of the money from that. The performer charges that, and keeps that to pay the other performers. It is easy to get around that cover charge, just come in before they start to charge and you can stay and watch the show for free. There is only a cover on that one night,  we had a fundraiser the other night, that we asked for a donation, but it was up to you if you wanted to pay. Other than that we don't have events that we charge a cover for. When you write these things that are not correct, they not only affect the bar but the people that work there, I'm sorry if you had a bad experience and we strive to please everyone but sometimes it is impossible.  Joe Cappelletti  owner\n\nMy response:\n\n\n\n\n19 hours ago\n\nI haven't said anything that wasn't correct. The person whom was collecting cover was foolishly playing around in the street and suddenly came running to the door to collect a 10 cover. Not a donation. \n\nFor someone that has been coming to this bar for years and suddenly see these changes, it's a bit disappointing. I understand a business must evolve so I don't fault you for that. I will stay away on these days.\n\nYou, on the other hand, seem to be defensive rather than listen to a customers comments. Just because you don't like what I say gives you no right to be defensive. \n\nAlso, if you read carefully, I did say it is a great place to go aside from the cover and drag show drama. And the fish comment isn't accusing you of fooling customers. Having seen \"henry\" as I have called the fish for years not being there anymore, and replaced by a lookalike was a bit disappointing but not fault of yours. \n\nI will be posting your email and my response to the public review as I feel it's important that people see my review and your feedback\n\nThanks\n\nAnd his last response: ( I haven't even read this nor do I plan on responding. no point, just wanted to throw this on here so everyone can see his character, spoken from his own words)\n\nOK you too need to read my response , there is a definite cover charge on Wednesday nights not a donation. I said that we had a fundraiser and they asked for a donation not a cover charge on that night . I also said you could easily avoid the cover charge by coming before they start charging the cover and get in for free and watch the show for free if you wanted to. I think you should post both of those things your review and my response and this one if you like. I tried to tell you a way around the cover, and also to straighten out that we don't charge a cover for other events \" other lame events. your words'. Which you implied in your review. As far as\" Henry\" is concerned,what was it you would have wanted me to do when replacing the fish? \"I guess they thought the customers wouldn't be able tell...\" again your words.. That seems like an unnecessary statement. If i seemed defensive I'm sorry but I don't like people making glib remarks that are not true and then telling me i have no right to do something.

The Giants are our local team, most of the people watching soccer haven't seen a game in years...they're just fans during the World Cup.  \n\nI'll be back to enjoy Moby Dick's, but they need to realize there are many in this neighborhood that do support their local teams.

This jock looking guy said as I walked by and looked at him, \"There's another woman here\". So I talked with him and his girlfriend. He thought I was very attractive, I guess with a lot of straight boys bone structure doesn't matter.\n\nSo as we were talking. This guy said to him, \"I'll suck your ****\" to which I replied, \"Why don't you let me **** it?\" and he said, \"You're a woman\" to which I replied, \"Not really, still got the plumbing and not getting rid of it\". I then ended up talking to him. We had an entertaining conversation, just discussing the gay scene and stuff.\n\nBut it's a fun bar. Most of the crowd here is 45+ and is the baby boomer gay crowd. If you're a twink or a clone, I'd avoid it unless you're looking for a daddy.\n\n*cue discussions about Judy Garland, Carmen Miranda, and Marlena Deitrich*\n\nThat's the crowd.
