I have been here a few times and always get their tasting menu. Each dish is not very big (duh, it's a tasting menu), but it's the perfect amount to leave me satisfied and full. Super interesting (but limited) wine selection as well.\n\nThe service and ambiance are great too. Never once did I have to ask for water, we got great explanations of the dishes, and it's a fun lively vibe inside.\n\nTHEY'RE CLOSING THOUGH :( Stupid SF raised the rent on them. My BF & I have joined their email list to see where they end up next, if they do pop ups, etc. Fingers crossed they come back soon!", "author": "Betty M."}

I came with a friend who had visited Prubechu previously, and had such a phenomenal experience, that she wanted to return once more, before their closing at the end of September.  I was really excited, since she had  such a wonderful dine here previously.  Sadly, our visit this time, was one big disappointment.  \n\nI surmise that our extreme lackluster experience may be due to their anticipated closing at the end of this month.  When my friend came here earlier this year, she was served good, generous portions of food.  Not at all the case this time.  Frankly, I think knowing they're closing altered their overall execution.  It is surprising though, given the fact that the waiter mentioned that the hope to relocate at a later date.  If that is indeed the case, I would think they would've made an effort to sustain the level of quality that earned them a good Yelp ratings to begin with.  Such a shame.   \n\nWe both ordered the Chef's tasting menu, for $65.  How they can justify the amount of food they serve for $65.00 is way beyond me. Very very small portions for mediocre food, which with taxes and tip, will cost you over $80.00.  Not at all justified for what we were served!  Bread, a couple of small appetizer size dishes, and the so-called \"main\" entree was a rice porridge dish with just a few diced pieces of meat, something better suited as a luncheon entree.  I was so dismayed when the waiter announced that that the so-called main entree was going to be our last savory dish, before the dessert.  Unbelievable, I thought, and I was right, as about three hours later, I was thinking we should have had a burrito at La Taqueria down the street instead.  I ended up snacking that night on some super delicious homemade soup given to me by wonderful friends, which saved me that night from going to bed hungry!  The highlight was the dessert, but that was literally a two bite item.  \n\nThis was my introduction to Guamanian cuisine, and probably my last, based on my experience here.  I'm wondering now if there's a reason why we don't see an influx of Guamanian restaurants all over the culturally cuisine diverse Bay Area.  I'm sure there's a mom or grandmother out there from Guam that makes delicious Guamanian food that I would just love, but she definitely wasn't in the kitchen at Prubechu!  \n\nSetting was pretty loud, not exactly what I would describe as conducive to conversation.  It was also somewhat unpleasantly warm inside, probably because of the small size of the restaurant, and the open kitchen with the gas stoves and flames burning like crazy.  \n\nPerhaps ordering a la carte entrees may have been the better way to go.  I was just so turned off by the whole experience, that I won't be giving them a second chance, even if they end up relocating.", "author": "Lori N."}

They didn't have a menu of the items because they're seasonal so they just explained each dish as it came out.\n\nI've never had Guamian cuisine before so I was pretty excited to try this place. After all 6 dishes, I have to say my favorite was the dessert - coconut salted caramel ice cream. The ice cream had a lot of shredded coconut in it, which was a really interesting texture. The taste was extremely rich and probably the best salted caramel ice cream I've ever had in terms of flavor.\n\nHowever the other dishes didn't really impress me. I found them lacking in terms of flavor complexity. They tasted overwhelmingly salty or acidic to me. My second favorite part of this meal was probably the lightly breaded egg in the porridge. \n\nI'm really glad that I tried the place, especially since I hear that it's closing soon. I am down to try more Guamian food but for now I have to say Prubechu looked better than it tasted.", "author": "Lily L."}

If anything it's always worth a try.  Both times we always did the Pres Fixe menu so I could try out different things and all the time it's always been really good. \n\nI do hope they come back.  \n\nI did see that somebody was complaining about a dish and the price but I'm basically thinking that.  That's SF and again one of the reason's why it's closing its doors because the rent has finally gotten too much.", "author": "Homer S."}

Prubechu is living proof that trying new things definitely pays off.\n\nTo start off, the service was great. Everyone was friendly and everyone seemed to genuinely be proud of the food that was being served. You can tell these people really care. \n\nWe did the tasting menu, so I'll just highlight a couple of the things we liked the most! For sure, my ultimate favorite was the corn soup. It was creamy, lots of sweet corn, spam, and crunchy onion bits. It also came at the perfect temperature--I like my soup barely cool enough to not scald my mouth. The last course: wild boar porridge with the fried egg was also amazing. We also liked the coconut candy ice cream that everyone seems to talk about. It had sooo many textures (in a good way).", "author": "Claire C."}

Inside you will find many cultural decor, books and artifacts paying homage to the island. \n\nMy husband and I share many fond memories here and are very sad to see that they will no longer be around. We came here last Friday to have a final date night to ourselves and enjoy some great food, chill music and wonderful hospitality. Every visit here we had tried something different. A few of my all time favorites include:\n\n1. Chamorro Empanada: Crispy on the outside, ooey gooey in the inside. Gotta have it with the Dinanche Aoli \n\n2. Shrimp Kelaguen with Tatiyas: Cause I cant find any other Chamorro restaurant that makes seafood kelaguen (this dish is usually made with chicken)\n\n3. Shrimp Pancake: It was our first time having it this weekend and its very similar to Chamorro shrimp patties. Fluffy, tons of shrimp/peas/corn baked inside drizzed with the dinanche aoli on top and arugula. great to share between 2-3 people. \n\n4. Lastly, their Roasted Pig: In the past we've attended one of their roasted pig events and it was amazing! Hands down was the best lechon i've ever had in my entire existence. If only lechon was a regular menu item i would request for it every single time. \n\nThank you to the wonderful staff of Prubechu for serving us.

I was able to book a same day reservation via yelp. Another wahoo!\n\nWe both got the $65 tasting menu and we were just blown away by the flavors and quality of the dishes. His favorite was the chicken sausage wrapped in banana leaf and my favorite was the homemade spam dish. I got the tasting menu last time I was there so I thought I would be disappointed, but I was even more impressed that I loved all the dishes I was served. I also very much love impressing my foodie husband because man, he can be picky sometimes!! He loved their beer selection too, especially the ones from Modern Times (brewery in San Diego) which he said he has never tried before. \n\nThe service was outstanding. I am pregnant so they hard boiled my egg versus leaving it runny in the spam porridge dish. Very accommodating and they do ask if you have any allergies or issues prior to serving the tasting menu of 5 dishes + bread. The bread starter was yummy and the last course, a salted ice cream dessert was super tasty. A lot of tasting menus (much more expensive ones too) I've had before don't start or end this well. \n\nThis place is truly a gem of San Francisco and I just found out that it is the only Bay Area eatery that serves Chamorro (island) food.

Getting to try Guamanian food was so fun -- this is not a cuisine you run into every day in the Bay Area!\n\nI did the tasting menu with a group of 6. The experience was fantastic! As other reviews have mentioned, is true that an assemblage of a la carte items shared family style might be more affordable if cost is a concern, but I enjoyed the experience of trying the chef's selections. I also thought it was a great value at $65, since we were served 6 generously portioned courses. \n\nEverything we tried was flavorful and delicious. We had 5 savory courses and 1 dessert: the rolls served at the beginning were outstanding, as was the soup, rice porridge with perfectly cooked egg (breaded and crispy on the outside, soft boiled on the inside... So good!), and pork rib. Everything was comforting and satisfying. We were all stuffed at the end!\n\nI loved the ambience of the restaurant as well; it's very cozy and casual, with an open kitchen where you can see the chef at work. \n\nThe service was also excellent. Our servers were attentive, and did a great job explaining the courses to us and pacing the meal. They also called the day of to confirm if anyone in our party had dietary restrictions that should be accounted for in our tasting menu, which I thought was great. \n\nThe wine and beer list was also great and reasonable, with most wines by the glass priced around $10. \n\nI'll definitely come back to do the tasting menu again or try the a la carte options.", "author": "Christine G."}

After vacillating about doing the tasting menu or a la carte, we were persuaded into the former since it was our first foray into Guamanian. (Note: they count the bread as one of the 6 courses, which is a little irksome. Just call it a 5- course menu!) \n\nThe courses were as follows:\n-Bread and butter: good but basic\n-Fried shrimp: served with aioli and escabeche-esque vegetables. The flavors were good, but I was disappointed at how soggy the shrimp batter was. No crunch. \n-Chicken sausage: cooked in a banana leaf and served with a cream sauce and fried onions. Again, this was good, but not anything memorable. \n-Rice porridge: with coconut milk, mushrooms, spam, and a whole egg fried Scotch-egg style. This was the standout dish. Really great flavor, and that egg was deliciously crispy and yolky. I didn't love the mushrooms as I don't think they melded well with the rest of it, but I still ate my bowl clean. \n-Poached cod: with broccolini and potato. Fine but not very memorable. \n-Coconut candy ice cream: wayyy too sweet for my liking, but has a slightly burnt taste at the end. I thought it was interesting but just not my thing. \n\nIn addition, we got the red rice with smoked meats. I felt that all the meat (pork shoulder and belly) was pretty tough. The rice was good though!\n\nAnd I would say overall the service was great. It's clear the owner cares about the food and his customers. I would almost bump to 4, but spending $90 each for a so-so meal makes me hesitant to really recommend this one.", "author": "Gwen H."}

Crust was good and crispy.  Aioli was delicious. \n\nBBQ Pork Ribs - came with 2 small ribs.  Good smoky flavor, but it wasn't fall off the bones and not super easy to eat.  \n\nGollai Hagon Suni - It was pretty much squash and spinach in a coconut curry sauce.  It had good flavor, but it's definitely not enough as an entree.  There's no carbs or anything filling in this dish. \n\nKelaguen Manok (chicken ceviche) - this was probably my favorite.  Chicken is bbq'd dry and was flavorful with lemon zest, which offered a more refreshing taste.  I liked making my own little wraps with the coconut flatbread and spicy aioli.  I kinda wish there were some veggies in here as that would have balanced out my wrap better. \n\nTinaktak - Imagine beef stroganoff...but sour.  That's what it tasted like to me.  It was interesting...I wasn't sure if I liked it or indifferent, but definitely didn't dislike it!\n\nWe also got sticky rice wrapped in a banana leaf with kiwi and some sort of cream sauce.

You know that moment when Remy takes a bite of the cheese, then takes a bite of the strawberry, then shoves both in his mouth and fireworks appear? That's how I felt when I was at Prubechu. I was intrigued by how familiar Chamorro food is to the palate (heavy American influence), and was pleasantly surprised by the warm service and cozy design. Above all though, what I feel Prubechu does best is producing what Remy feels that moment he has both the strawberry and cheese in his mouth, FIREWORKS. Prubechu knows what ingredients work with what, and how to elevate flavors to the next level, all whilst doing it in an incredibly unique and new way! Absolutely loved it.\n\n(If you have no idea what I'm mentioning above, see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yyah49_Oz78)\n\nNow let's dive into each dish. We did the tasting menu with a side order of flatbreads, which my boyfriend loved, paired with their special house butter:\n\n-Bread & Butter: Can we just talk about how soft and moist the bread is? Piping hot straight from the oven. Great start to the meal.\n\n-\"Chicken Pot Pie\" as I like to say: Creamy chicken with peas, crispy chicken skin, and pea sprouts. LOVED IT. Tasted like a lighter version of the inside of a chicken pot pie. The peas were very fresh and sweet and added such a lightness to the heavier chicken cream dish. The crispy chicken skin reminded me of the outside of a chicken pot pie, crispy and salty, love! \n\n-Spam & Eggs: PHENOMENAL. My favorite dish! Perfectly cooked soft boiled egg, crispy spam with a soy sauce like sauce drizzled overtop, paired with asparagus and avocado puree. WOW. This is where I really got that Remy feeling, those fireworks. The avocado puree added such creaminess yet freshness to the dish, emphasized by the asparagus. Egg was perfect and whatever sauce they used tied it all together. PERFECT.\n\n-Beef Egg Roll: Again, phenomenal use of flavors. Fresh light tartness from the cucumer salad on top, creamy sweet spinach below, and spicy meaty filling in the egg roll. Exquisite!\n\n-Porridge with Wild Mushrooms and Black Truffle Caviar (additional $10): incredibly flavorful again to no surprise! I found this dish a bit too heavy for me, and couldn't finish it all (which is when the bf hopped in). Lots of creaminess from the mushrooms and porridge and a nice hint of brininess with the caviar. Beautifully paired.\n\n-Pork Belly: And I thought the meal was over until we were served this! Crispy pork belly with carrots and swiss chard. That pork belly was GOOD, super crispy, juicy, flavorful and paired with the two sauces, carrot, and swiss chard...again, FIREWORKS.\n\n-Roasted Banana Ice Cream: I usually hate banana ice cream because I hate the fake banana taste, but since this was made from scratch from real bananas, it tasted real good! Loved the chocolate drizzle over top and they sprinkle some sea salt to really enhance the sweetness. Unfortunately mine had a bit too much salt but hey, can't go wrong with dessert!\n\nAll in all, I'll def be back! Looking forward to trying separate items on their menu like their fish imported straight from Guam. Impeccable food and service! Best kept secret in SF!", "author": "Cynthia H."}

(Tuba, we are told, is coconut sap, which is made into wine). The rolls arrive tiny and hot, with big flakes of salt and black sesame on top. They are soft, moist and pillowy, but substantive. \n\nNext came an heirloom tomato salad, with bitter melon, anchovy salsa, and house made shrimp chips! The shrimp chips weren't as puffy as the kind you buy at the store, the ones that stick to your tongue when you put them in your mouth... you know what I'm talking about. But they did taste exactly like shrimp chips, and I was super impressed that they even thought of making them -- it's like trying to make your own pringles or something, seemingly impossible to achieve with human hands. The bitter melon is an acquired taste, one that I am only now starting to develop after a lifetime of being Chinese (American) but there are just a few pieces so it's a low key way to taste it without being overwhelmed. (It's hella good for you so it's worth trying to like it.)\n\nThe next dish brought another housemade version of junk food: spam! This was my favorite dish of the night -- a corn soup, enriched with coconut milk, redolent of  corn but accented by squares of pork shoulder that were dubbed spam. Much better than the canned variety, this version was smoky and salty, a perfect counterpoint to the sweet corn and crisp onions. \n\nBut wait! I think this next dish was my fave. A bowl of rice porridge that was thick and creamy, the grains of rice blended to be indistinguishable yet retaining a slight bite of texture, tinted orange from achote, and unexpectedly exploding with umami. Topped with maitake mushrooms, a crispy fried soft boiled egg (runny yolk!), and that topped with black truffle tapioca (a $10 add on that made this dish unforgettable) this was somehow comfort food that you've never had before but wish you could eat every Sunday. \n\nI really was stuffed at this point but the waiter-who-is-also-an-owner brought out a dish of fried cod on a bed of baby bok choy with microgreens. He poured on an amazing broth made from the bones of the cod which was rich and layered with so much complexity. My husband deemed it his favorite of the night. The fish was a tad overfried but still was thoroughly enjoyable. At this point I had to take it to go, because I was unable to go on. It made a lovely snack the next day.\n\nOf course I still had dessert stomach ... which our waiter-owner brought out with a candle to commemorate our anniversary. Very sweet. It was apigigi- cassava and coconut wrapped in banana leaves like a tamale, topped with strawberries. It sounds humble but it's one of those things you just don't want to stop eating until suddenly it's gone. \n\nThe service was friendly, well paced, and attentive without hovering. We were one of just a couple of tables, which makes no sense: great food, flavor profiles that you can't get anywhere else, open kitchen, vegetable forward -- everything that's in demand right now. So I kind of want this place to blow up, because the one Gaumanian (Chamorro) restaurant in the city really should get the chance to thrive, but I don't want it to get so trendy it becomes impossible to get a reservation. Right now it's calm enough to bring your parents out have a good long chat with a long lost friend, and unusual enough to feel like an adventure. We will be back to try the regular menu or to beg for more porridge.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Seriously, WTF.\n\nHow do you force people to do the tasting course just because your over 4 guests? We were at 5 guests for a low key birthday dinner.\n\nAnyways we hesitantly accepted to do the tasting course since their regular menu is bomb. But why not, give it a shot.... \n\nThought it started decent with some delicious bread rolls then it went down hill from there. Basically the rest of the course was basically a squash soup, 1 sausage that was just ok, and 1 shrimp, and some sad porridge rice dish where the base was the earlier squash soup but turned into a thicker sauce. Oh and some bland coconut dessert that we left alone.\n\n$65 for that garbage of a set up per person.\n\nI don't mind paying x amount if the food is amazing. Food has no price if its good. This was a rip. Shit food courses that left you starving. We had to order their Fish at the end. Left there reeking of fried oil because dinner service took more than 3 hours. Unbelievable really. \n\nHow can their regular menu be amazing, and their pre fix tasting the total opposite? Very unfortunate as I would of easily been a regular here. But the feeling of that night's experience and being ripped off will leave me bitter to never return.\n\nTo the chef/ owner. Stick to your regular menu and expand on having the dishes more sharing style. Drop your poor excuse of an attempt of a wannabe Michelin pretentious pre-fix coursing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-02", "description": "Great food overall. I am giving four stars because after dining here 2 times I found a couple inconsistencies and was slightly disappointed after my second visit because I was raving about what I experienced the 1st time and brought someone to try the restaurant for their first time and when I ordered a couple same dishes it wasn't exactly the presentation as what I experienced. I really love the restaurant and it is very delicious food And I will definitely return again.  I just wanted to point out that for instance I ordered the Red Rice dish which has smoked meats and the first time I had it it was a mix of pork belly that was seared perfectly with sliced pork but also had a sample of ribs. The same ribs that we experienced as an appetizer before we had this as a main course. See my picture posted. Not sure if that was just something that was given to us special? but the second time I ordered it there were no ribs on this dish which is why I didn't order the ribs as an appetizer for my guest to try on their first experience eating here because I assumed they were going to be a couple on the red rice platter. Also the pork belly was not seared (or roasted more crisp?) the same and seemed very fatty nor had a nice crisp bite to it which with pork belly it's a hit or miss because then it can taste like a piece of fat you want to spit out. It was cooked excellent the first time. The red rice dish is served  broccolini which I love but first time there was also some micro greens garnish too? The salad we tried the second time was delicious with fresh beets and avocado, fresh vinaigrette. I appreciate the fact that the server presented the food and explained in detail what we were about to try which is a nice touch. Definitely love the Tinaktak - handmade noodles mushrooms, braised beef and sauce that has a nice hint of citrus served with green beans. The chicken ceviche is a winner - Kelaguen. Try it it's wonderful served with an aoli that has slight spicy kick and warm titiyas - coconut type a flat bread that you fill with the chicken and fresh coconut.  Overall I really enjoyed the food at this restaurant and it is worth visiting and to try a new experience in SF which truly sets this restaurant apart from the dozens of Japanese Mexican, Korean, Italian etc restaurants we have as many options to enjoy.  Prubechu is worth visiting if you've never had \"Chamorro food\" and curious about Guam style native cuisine.", "author": "Noey G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-21", "description": "I've never had tried food from Guam before so I can't speak as to authenticity but the food was tasty! We tried the coconut braised beef, which looked a lot like beef stroganoff. It had a nice coconut milk flavor to it but the portion of noodles was smaller than other plates so the sauce to noodle ratio was off. The red rice with pork belly was a pretty large portion of tasty, mostly tender pork chunks and red rice. We also got the black cod fish collar and tail. It was steamed in a banana leaf which my friends like but I think would have preferred those cuts grilled. The one thing we did not care for was the shrimp ceviche and bread. The term ceviche is a little misleading because the shrimp tasted over cooked. It may have tasted better if the bread was toasted or fried like a tortilla. Apparently this is one of their signature items and there were many raves on yelp so maybe it was an off day. \n\nThis place is pretty small and they don't have a real kitchen so don't be surprised if it takes awhile to get your food. Luckily we weren't too hungry when we arrived but don't come with a group bigger than 4. The people working here are really friendly though so I hope they are able to expand the kitchen a bit.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-30", "description": "First off, I'm from Guam and grew up surrounded by people cooking Chamorro food, so I have a pretty good palate for Chamorro cuisine. Off the bat, I didn't have too high a standard for Prubechu and was expecting something akin to Jamaican Grill (if you're from Guam, you know the reference), something commercial, something quick, something splattered on your plate in large quantities with little thought. \n\nDon't expect a traditionalist approach to Chamorro food that you'd find from your n\u00e5nan biha or at fiestas. And It's not a touristy restaurant that you'd find back on-island that presents \"authentic\" Chamorro food. Think refined culinary practices meet Chamorro cuisine. \n\nI ordered the Shrimp Kelaguen and Red Rice plate (pork belly, tinala) and apigigi' for dessert. Every element of my dish was carefully constructed. Everything from the finadeni (soy sauce based dipping) to the seasoned vegetables on my plate were given a lot of attention to the tee. The finadeni was a small example of fine culinary practice that I immediately noticed even before tasting a single item of my dish. The finadeni, the staple gold dipping sauce to everything Chamorro, was perfectly balanced and had onion chunks that were finely cubed and consistent - such attention to minute details like this is something easily overlooked even in the Marianas and was an indicator of the type of quality gastronomy I was about to experience. Their pork belly was well-rendered with a fantastic bark that had so much depth and nicely cut the richness of the pork belly. It had all you would expect from a traditional Chamorro pork belly but the treatment of such a simple dish was of such a high degree. I would never expect to find that pork belly at a fiesta table. The tinala, a dish that is often easily dried out and left hard and chewy, was moist and tender. You could taste the smoke penetrated flavors in the meat. Their shrimp kelaguen was refreshing and surprisingly incredibly fresh! For dessert was apigigi' but never had I eaten apigigi' adorned with anything except its banana leaf wrapping. My apigigi' was accompanied with strawberry compote slices and a cream mixture atop a traditional banana leaf. Definitely not your night market apigigi'. It was amazingly well complemented. It felt like an orchestra of flavors were playing in my mouth. Apigigi' had never been played with any other instrument till I had Prubechu's. In all, I didn't feel like there was anything on my plate that was simply thrown on as simple garnishing. Every element of my meal was well thought out, intentional and executed superbly. (They have seasonal tasting courses that I will definitely be back for!)\n\nPrubechu treats Chamorro cuisine, as I have few times seen it treated in the restaurant, as a serious culinary cuisine. If you're looking for a replication of fiesta food, you'll find some of that, however, if you're looking to expand your idea of Chamorro cuisine, they push the envelope.", "author": "Leonardo O."}

The wait staff was kind and friendly\n2). Pretty much everything tasted good \n\nThings that could be much better: \n1). There is basically no ventilation in this restaurant, other than them having the front door open all night and having floor fans blasting. Because the kitchen is right next to the dining area (without a wall) the air is very thick, and I ended up coming home with my clothes smelling like fried fish. Not exactly the sort of clean, comfortable ambience that you'd want on a date. \n\n2). Their Tasting Menu for $65 is a rip off, in my opinion. They like to surprise you with what you'll be served, so it was an even bigger disappointment to see such mediocre courses served: \nFirst course -- three small bread rolls. This should be a free side, not part of the tasting menu. \nSecond course -- corn soup with homemade spam -- excellent! \nThird course -- some sort of flat bread with some veggies on top. The size was small, and it tasted OK. But again, the main ingredient here is flour. \nFourth course -- 2 or 3 small pieces of pork belly, and a few small potatoes. Is this was supposed to be the \"wow\" part of the meal, it certainly was underwhelming \nFifth course -- coconut ice cream -- tasted good, but I'm not sure why I had to wait 30 minutes after the last course to get this. \nMy understanding is that a tasting menu is supposed to be the highlights of what a restaurant has to offer. It was very unsatisfying -- and even more at this price. \n\n3). I ordered the fried fish head for $32. At the time, I thought I was getting a whole fried fish, head included. But instead, I got a bed of veggies, and a fried fish head. Yes, my wife and I were able to dig out about 4 forkfuls of meat, but this absolutely should not count as a main course. It might have made sense as a side, for $18. \n\nI told our server that I thought the fishhead was a ripoff. He apologized, and eventually gave my wife and me complimentary glasses of wine. This was very nice on his part, but did not really undo the fact that I think this restaurant represents the worst of the food scene in SF -- overpriced, overhyped new restaurants. We spent $180 for dinner (including a bottle of wine) whereas for that money we could have gone to nearly Lolinda and eaten great. Or more satisfying would have been the nearby Taqueria -- simple food, but good amounts of meat, great flavors, and non-crazy prices.", "author": "Jim M."}

The restaurant has a fun and relaxed vibe where the music creates an atmosphere but doesn't dominate your conversations.  The dishes I tried had expertly balanced flavors and textures while also staying true to authentic Guamanian cuisine.  I started off with the empanada.  Perfectly cooked so it was crunchy without any hint of oiliness.  It was balanced with a small salad that added freshness.  The flavors in the salad were so impressive that I'd order it as a stand-alone course.  I had the red rice as a main course.  It had a medley of smoked pork that was crispy and tender.  The amount of smoke in the meat was flavorful without overpowering the other flavors in the meat.  It came with a medley of grilled vegetables, pickles and a soy/vinegar sauce that perfectly offset the fat from the pork.  The side of flavorful red rice was the appropriate starch to complimented the pork.  I'll definitely be coming back soon and will be bringing friends.", "author": "Craig S."}

This would be only my second time having Chamorro food, but I have to say this is an elevated take on it. Everything came out fresh and delicious, my only gripe and the reason to bring it down a star would be for the pace of the prix fixe, don't get me wrong we both tend to eat really quickly, but there were times where we really felt like we were waiting for too long and in their defense they were getting busy so it's really not the end of the world. Other than that a really great arrangement of beers to choose from and friendly/informational service. I will say that I did leave full, but the dessert didn't quite feel fulfilling enough, it was almost more of an amuse bouche, but hey it was truly delicious and fun to eat.

I definitely tried a lot of new tastes here and had a pleasant experience but just don't think it's likely I'll return.\n\nThe set menu was $65/person for 5 course which wasn't a good deal. Portions were hefty for a tasting menu and I definitely left full, but it didn't have the elegance of a meal of that price. They didn't change out the utensils between courses so you often had some tastes mixing together. They did clear out and replace dishes at nice intervals and the staff was very friendly.\n\nThe food itself was a progression starting with a nice flat bread starter which wasn't part of the 5-courses and ended with a desert that also didn't count (so they do try to exceed expectations). So you are getting a 7 course meal in some ways. There was some interesting flavors ranging from the home made spam to the short rib in broth. Overall though there wasn't anything that I felt I absolutely had to have more of. There is no overlap of the tasting menu with the regular menu unfortunately.\n\nIf the menu was at the previous prices, I'd think it was a steal and be more forgiving. At these prices, I expect a lot more (even if it was less courses). Trestle in Financial District offers less courses (3 total) but for $35 with a more impressive atmosphere/setting. This place felt like a neighborhood Mission joint but trying to charge a lot for some nicely plated Guam food but without any killer dish or refined service.\n\nOverall, I don't regret trying it, if only to see what Guam food is like and I can see the potential.

What an amazing way to start the meal unfortunately it was mostly downhill from here.\n\n* Ahi Tuna Sashimi w/Egg (2 STARS): The tuna was shockingly low grade tasting, and I could probably make a better seasoned egg. A nice attempt at an upscale dish but not executed well and ingredients sub-par.\n\n* Ceviche Style Chicken (1.5 STARS): An interesting dish which may originate from Guam? Not something I've ever had. The chicken is shredded and cooked ceviche style (with citrus juice). However, the end result is a dry tuna-like shredded chicken taco.\n\n* Shrimp dish (1 STAR): I forget what this was called exactly but it comes in a small ceramic dish baked in a thick yellow sauce. I couldn't help but think how much it reminded me of United Airlines food on international flights.\n\n* Rice, Pork, Potato Soup (3 STARS): This is good but tastes like the soup my mom makes when there is leftover rice which she rehydrates with extra pork soup.\n\n* Porridge (5 STARS): I don't know exactly what was in this porridge, and I never though porridge could be this amazing, but it was really flavorful, savory, and delicious. I had to resist licking my bowl clean.\n\n* Coconut Ice Cream with Candied Nuts (4.5 STARS): This was so delicious, especially with the candied nuts - I could eat it all day and would buy it to take home if I could!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-05", "description": "4.5 STARS\n\nFirst times tend to be awkward and frankly not very good. \n\nThink about your first kiss...the first time you boinked.... \n\nAre you getting a mental picture yet?\n\nUmmm yah, I think the only memorable moment was being able to brag to your friends about how \"awesome\" it was to pop your cherry. More like awesomely awkward and disappointing especially if the dude's headgear cuts your lip but hey, no one has to know that. Shhhh...\n\nLast night was the first time I tried Guam cuisine and it was anything but awkward or disappointing. Grand opening on Tuesday, Prubechu took over old Roxy's location. The executive chef previously worked with Chef Manny at Mr. Pollo and the GM previously worked at The Palace so it was no surprise to see a similar concept. Balling on a budget as I would call it. For just $40, you get a five course tasting menu plus two amuse bouches and a dessert which is a fantastic deal. There's also an a la carte menu available. Beer & wine only. CC's accepted. \n\nPrubechu is SF's first Guam restaurant so expect to see Spanish and Filipino influenced cuisine with a refined Californian twist. The chef shops daily for his ingredients so the menu may change on a daily basis depending on what's seasonally available. \n\nFIVE COURSE TASTING MENU - $40: http://bit.ly/1eXPm1d\n*Amuse bouche: Oyster w/ coconut vinegar & kiwi: http://bit.ly/1lCMG1G\n(1) 9 Minute Egg w/ avocado & caramelized soy: http://bit.ly/LBD1Ys\n(2) Chicken Keleguan w/ coconut, scallion & titiyas & amuse bouche of pickled veggies: http://bit.ly/1btHZh6\n(3) Shrimp Patty w/ corn & peppers: http://bit.ly/1iwq9i2\n(4) Chalakilis w/ porridge, smoked pork belly,  achiote & quail egg: http://bit.ly/1g5Nsxm\n(5) Kadu w/ short ribs, rice, peas, potato, mung bean sprouts: http://bit.ly/1fVXTEW\n*Complimentary Housemade Coconut & Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream: http://bit.ly/1iwqKjy\n\nA freshly shucked oyster with a tropical twist nicely started our dinner. For the first course, I would have preferred a more runny egg but the creamy avocado and the savory pungent caramelized soy added another dimension that more than made up for it. Like a flatbread, the Chicken Keleguan was very satisfying especially with the kewpie and chili peppers for a creamy, fiery bite. The shrimp patty was presented as a \"souffl\u00e9\" but the texture was more like scrambled eggs. This was my least favorite of the tasting menu. \n\nMoving on to the more stick to your ribs courses, the Chalakilis was like a rendition of pork and grits. Slightly caramelized around the edges, the tender pork belly had a nice smokiness to it and was heightened when dipped into the runny quail egg. My favorite dish of the night was the Kadu. Comfort in a bowl, the chunk of English cut short rib was incredibly tender and totally hit a soft spot with the slightly sticky rice. \n\nThe tasting menu ended with a complimentary dessert of Housemade Coconut & Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream that was enjoyably rich and not too sweet. Loved the sprinkling of pie crust (?) for that textural contrast. \n\nService was professional, knowledgeable, and attentive. Since Guam cuisine is new to many people, the staff was more than happy to explain it to us. Food service was timely. Expect to spend about 2 hours for the tasting menu. \n\nOn the intimate side, Prubechu makes for a great date place. There's just six 2-tops, two 4-tops, one 6-top, and several counter seats overlooking the open kitchen  so do make reservations as I expect this place to get busy once the word gets out about this place. \n\nOverall, Prubechu's food is a solid 4 stars (there's always room for improvement right?) while service was 5 stars. 4.5 stars and rounding up for having the balls to open a restaurant with a cuisine that's unbeknownst to most. Especially to someone who thought Guam cuisine was Filipino cuisine. And, I'm part Filipina... =X", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Serving authentic home-cooked meals and elevate it to another level of art with elegance and extraordinary taste to give your palette an experience. \n\n- FOOD, so delicious and very filling (see my pictures)\n- PRICES, fair\n- SERVICE, the best, very professional\n- AMBIANCE, simple - i like it\n\nThank you Chef Shaun and other Shaun for keeping me company and educating me on the art of Chamorro cooking. I have alot of Chamorro friends in WA and these two guys are now my first in SF. They just opened so their menu is limited for the moment. They have a 5 tasting course ($40 - and well worth it, those portions were mini meals) OR you can do an Ala Carte with two dishes. I chose the 5 tasting course to be able to consume multiple dishes in one sitting. Also, I was given other dishes to sample that were not on that tasting menu. \n\nISLANDER GENEROSITY.\n\nTasting #1: MIYAGI w/ VINEGAR, COCONUT, AND KIWI DRESSING - I love fresh shucked oysters on its own with very minimal dressing because dressings usually mask the flavor of a raw oyster. The vinegar, coconut, and kiwi was a perfect light combination to compliment the miyagi oyster. the flavors were subtle. Light hints of coconut and kiwi were a hit for this dish. Also, I learned that the vinegar comes from the coconut tree. Very interesting information.\n\nTasting #2: EGG w/ AVOCADO AND CARAMELIZED SOY - this was not your typical boiled egg. The egg was soft boiled and very delicate. It was split in half and sitting on a fluff of creamy avocado puree, divided by the caramelized soy and drizzled with chickweed (the green stuff), and sprinkled lightly with Iranajan salt (that's a village in Guam - some lady takes the water from where the ocean and the river meet and goes through a process of fermentation to get the salt). Again, very interesting information. For me this dish had a play between salty and sweet, my palette loves salty and sweet combinations so I really enjoyed this dish. \n\nTasting #3: CHICKEN KELEGUAN - served on flat bread made from coconut milk instead of water and topped with fennel sprouts. The flatbread was had a nice soft crunch on the edges and it is a little more dense then other flatbreads but it has a different flavor as it was made with coconut milk. the chicken keleguan was really good and and made with quality. It was topped with fennel sprouts which gave it color and some herbal flavor. TITIYAS!\n\nTasting #4: PICKLED VEGGIES - pickled cauliflower, pickled green daikon, pickled regular daikon, and pickled watermelon red radish. Everything pickled. My favorite was the pickled watermelon red radish.\n\nTasting #5: SHRIMP PATTY - shrimp patty and shaved Jerusalem artichokes & cucumbers. Usually shrimp patties are fried, their presentation was more of a souffle style. I'm use to the heavy shrimp patties and more oily but this one wasn't like that and had a \"healthier\" approach to it. The jerusalem artichokes and cucumbers were a nice palette refresher when eating something like a shrimp patty.\n\nTasting #6: CHALAKILIS - it's Guam's version of rice porridge. Served with rice, pork belly and braised smoked meat with tiny quail egg and flavors of tumeric. THIS WAS ONE OF MY FAVORITE DISHES OF THE EVENING. I love Chalakilis and this was SO BOMB. Very filling, it literally was a mini meal on its own. The porriadge was this deep tan color and it had an incredible flavor, the pork belly and smoked meat just put everything together. The boiled quail egg wasn't overly cooked, when I popped the quail egg in my mouth the yolk squirted out. YUM.\n\nTasting #7: KADU - shortrib, rice, peas, potato, mung bean sprouts, savory/rich soup base, and a dabble of finadene on top. This reminds me very much of a Filipno soup dish but a different twist to it. The shortrib was perfectly prepared and the soup base was very savory and rich, I can just eat the soup and rice by itself and be happy. THIS WAS MY OTHER FAVORITE DISH OF THE EVENING. I was so full after Tasting #6, I took a few bites of Tasting #7 and pack the rest up. \n\nTasting #8: ICECREAM - dessert, \"manha\" (young coconut), Tahitian vanilla, cookie crumbles, and sweet pansies (flowers). HOUSEMADE. The icecream was the perfect way to end a very savory #7 course tasting meal. I love icecream so I know when to judge icecream. The young coconut flavor could be tasted and the after-taste of Tahitian vanilla. The cookie crumbles provided texture and enjoyed it. Who would have ever thought of eating flowers with your icecream, THEY DID. \n\nI left slightly bent over and can barely walk. THAT'S HOW GOOD THIS PLACE IS.\n\nWill I be back? YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK ME TWICE.\n\nJABA APPROVED. Until the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

Due to this and my heritage to Hawaii, I was excited to try the Chamorroan food.  My friends and I decided on the $40 5 course tasting menu.\n\nThe course began with a amuse buche of an oyster with a citrus seasoning from Guam. I couldn't taste the citrus, only the oyster.  \n\nThe first course was a boiled egg with caviar. It was a little salty, but not bad. \n\nThe second course was the chicken kelegun which was a shredded chicken, spices, and served on a flat bread. This reminded me of chicken salad and not to my liking for texture and taste.\n\nThe third course was supposed to be the shrimp omelet, but they ran out of it.  They were saving it for the chefs friends table whom we saw were served the dish, though they were seated after us by 20 minutes. We were served with a a shoyu picked eggplant, vegetable variety dish. I thought it was tasty, as shoyu and picked is always good. But it was a slight heavy on the shoyu.\n\nThe fourth course was the one that I enjoyed the most. It was a braised pork stew served with rice porridge.  The dish was smoky and the taste was prominent throughout the entire dish and bite.  A really good dish.\n\nThe fifth course was a clear broth soup with beef (I think) and rice.  This course irritated me the most. Only because the execution of the dish was off. We had to ask for spoons, rather than the staff set spoons down before serving the dish. They realized the mistake, but still this small execution bothered me. The dish wasn't bad, as the flavors were nice due to the additional sauce you can pour it. It was a shoyu pickled base sauce which really brought out the flavors of the beef and the broth.  \n\nDessert was coconut ice cream.  Sweet and with a good flavor of coconut, it ended the course well. \n\nI think if they continue to improve on the execution of the service this restaurant will do well.   It is still young, so if people could help support it as the lone Guamanian restaurant in the city they will improve in both food and service.", "author": "Marck N."}

Inside can be a bit crowded at times, especially for events such as the screening of \"Talent Town\" in San Francisco by the Mu\u00f1a Bros., so I would recommend making a reservation in advance if you want to be guaranteed a seat.\n\nIf you are a veteran to consuming Chamorro food, please leave your expectations of cheap fiesta-style platters, with large servings of food, and a buffet-style presentation at the door. Prubechu demonstrates a focus on quality and service, and has an atmosphere reminiscent of the Islands. You can tell that Shawn and Shawn (both owners and one the head chef) do their best to serve delicious Chamorro food to the Bay area, and as a Chamorro diaspora Prubechu does an outstanding job. You almost feel like you are back on Guam or the CNMI when you eat here, they even play classic Chamorro music here! Then... you feel the cold outside and remember that this is Chamorro cuisine being served in San Francisco!\n\nIf you are new to consuming Chamorro food, Prubechu is a fantastic introduction into the cuisine commonly consumed in Guam and the CNMI, and in its own right is a fine dining establishment. Appreciate the cuisine it for what it is (Chamorro food), rather than thinking about it as a variation or knock off of something you may have tried before (Mexican, Asian, Filipino, etc.), and you'll likely enjoy this food! \n\nI usually order from the ala carte menu when I dine here since I come often by myself, mostly the empanada (Chamorro style), kelaguen m\u00e5nnok (chicken kelaguan), tinaktak (beef with coconut milk and, here at Prubechu, served with egg noodles), and hineksa' ag\u00e5'ga (red rice). \n\nAfter eating here regularly for several months, I have yet to find anything that I do not like, and I look forward to Prubechu's evolution into the place for Chamorro food here in the Bay area.\n\nBiba Prubechu!

The food is very original (if you are not accustomed to Guam's cuisine) and really tasty. From the outside, it is unassuming, but you walk in and have a great experience. \n\nI would highly recommend the reasonably priced tasting menu. Other reviewers mention $40, but I think they raised it to $50, which is still well worth it for the 6 course meal. Interestingly, *none* of the dishes on the tasting menu are on the regular menu, so order the tasting menu, sit back, relax, and get ready for an adventure.\n\nOur tasting (sounds like it varies every night; what came out was a surprise even to the waiter!):\nChalakilis toasted rice porridge - favorite dish\nMotsiyas chicken sausage - tasty, nice spicy sauce on side to give it a kick\nFrittata cappellini\nSmoked pork jerky - cool dish\nLocal dungeness crab - close second favorite\nGuam ice cream - tastiest dessert I have had in a while!\n\nThe owners and waiters are genuinely Guamanian, and specifically Chamorros (be sure to read the wikipedia page on Guam before you go).", "author": "Mike G."}

Unusual ingredients used in imaginative ways, great presentation, and friendly service all made this memorable. Unfortunately the timing of the dishes was not ideal, with long waits between some of the courses. \n\nAnd with the price of the tasting menu creeping up from $40 to $50 and now $65 (!!), and a very small selection on the regular menu, I'm afraid I've been priced out of coming again. Frankly I couldn't afford it to begin with. Perhaps it's a supply and demand thing, but I fear these guys will not endure the divergence between the humble neighborhood and rootsy background of the food  and the super highbrow prices.

Given the crazy inconvenience of trying to park in this part of the Mission, not sure if we'll ever make it back here any time soon. But yeah, the food was definitely memorable and pretty good value.\n\nWe had the tasting menu... pretty ingenious that the chefs here can pull this type of menu off without having access to either a stove or an oven (they use induction hot plates to do everything). But not having either means that they also don't have a vent so the restaurant was crazy hot. And not having either means that ironically a lot of the food is cooked ahead and then re-heated and therefore not that hot.\n\nThat said, each course of the menu was better than the last. It started off kinda shaky with a warm oyster, but kept getting better and better until it finished with that wonderful coconut ice cream (still thinking about it). We were impressed by the unfamiliar taste profiles and the creativity of a lot of the dishes.\n\nIf we come again we'll try some of the entrees which also looked quite good. The service was a bit uneven and the pace of service a bit off, but I'm confident that these guys will work out the kinks and make this restaurant into a local favorite. That might involve getting rid of the tasting menu (probably more suited to a different kind of restaurant) and just focusing on entrees. So if you're into a taste adventures you better try this place before this option disappears.", "author": "Art C."}

However, with a few tweaks and changes, it definitely has a lot of potential to warrant 4 or even 5 stars. \n\nPrubechu was our choice for a Valentine's dinner this year. We were looking for something low-key, intimate and adventurous in the Mission so voila! The restaurant is very casual yet still manages to maintain an air of classiness - it's quite small so I'm sure once the word gets out, it'll start to get quite busy. The waiter was definitely very friendly and answered all of our questions about Guam-cuisine. \n\nHowever, my two peeves were 1) the slow service and 2) the actual food itself\n\nThe restaurant only has a prix fix menu - 5 courses for $40. It's definitely a steal price-wise as there are several amuse bouches not accounted for in the 5 courses. However, we had very mixed feelings about the courses. \n\nThe first course (Egg with avocado, caramelized soy and salmon): delicious! The texture, flavor and presentation were all flawless \n\nThe second course (chicken keleguan with coconuts, scallions and titiyas): the dressing was a bit intense and the flavor, although abundantly apparent, was just a bit too overwhelming and confusing \n\nThe third course (shrimp patty with corn and peppers): solid. However, nothing to write home about. I've had similar shrimp patties in mediocre seafood restaurants\n\nThe fourth course (Chalakilis with porridge, anchovy, quail egg and pork): so I loved individual elements of this dish. The pork is well made. The quail egg was delicious. The porridge texture was great. The anchovy was raw and could have been good on its own. However, when combined, it was a very confusing mix with so many implosions of different flavors. \n\nThe fifth course (kadu with shortrib, rice, potatoes, bean sprouts and peas): yum. This was definitely one of the highlights, second to the opener. The shortrib was well cooked and the texture was perfect. \n\nI think the slow service could be attributed to the fact that they had just recently opened a month before we went and were understaffed for Vday. As for the food, there were too many flavors floating around - they just need to be refined in a consumable manner. \n\nHowever, for $40, it's definitely worth checking out. And I see a lot of potential. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

Both guys were friendly, attentive, and very happy to answer all our questions about Chamarro food.  \n\nThis Tasting Menu is always amazing. They experiment with different ingredients and flavors so the dishes are either completely different or modified for a twist on the last time. \n\nMy fave: the porridge with quail egg and pork -- interesting flavors (a hint of sourness like Kim Chi + a brief, spicy kick) and I really liked the texture (almost like oatmeal).  Reminded me of rice porridge my dad used to make when I got sick as a kid.\n\nGreat vibe and fun atmosphere on a Saturday night.  We ate from 8-10pm and had an awesome time.

I could've eaten 5 courses of this dish alone. \n\nThe open kitchen did not seem like a real kitchen. There was a line of table top hot plates and no vent to suck out the fumes.

We opted for the 5 course tasting menu for $40, figuring this would provide a foodie short course on what was on offer.\n\nA miyagi oyster with aged coconut vinegar (!) was the first amuse bouche, and a fine start. Much better than a traditional mignionette, the vinegar enhanced the briny succulence of the oyster without overpowering the seaside flavor. Really excellent in quality and composition.\n\nNext followed an 8-minute egg sliced in half and flavored with carmelized soy and an avocado puree. Outstanding! I am now in love with carmelized soy and will be using it to enhance my eggs, meats, vegetables and whatever else i can concoct. The soy avocado combo would be a vast improvement on the typical mexican dip, watch out guacamole you're going guamanian in my house!\n\nPrubechu does serve beer and wine, pbr, lagunitis and anchor steam for you beer drinkers. I knew the Justin cabernet on offer and chose that in favor of the pinot, chardonnay and savignon blanc. Wine choices were solid, i talked to the waiter, former employee of olivier's butchery in the dogpatch, about the choices and he was well versed. In fact, when questioned, he knew every ingredient and how it was prepared in every item we ate that night. Kudos for excellence in service.\n\nChicken keleguan was shredded chicken and scallions, shredded coconut and spices atop a coconut flatbread. A sort of guamanian tostada. I liked it, would make a great light lunch, especially with fruit.\n\nA traditional guam style shrimp cake was elevated in another course featuring shrimp, corn and peppers served souffle style in tiny tart cups. Light yet savory, a few perfect bites.\n\nPork belly played a starring role, crispy and smoked, in chalakilis, a rice porridge with quail egg and achiote. This would be an excellent breakfast dish.\n\nNext to last, and certain to top off your tank, was the kadu, a luscious shortrib stew with peas, potato, glass noodles and mung bean sprouts. Almost a halo halo stew, thankfully not sweet. Perfect for a cold, rainy night.\n\nDessert was a lovely, refined green coconut/tahitian vanilla ice cream. Flecks of vanilla floating through the creamy concoction.\n\nI really enjoyed the culinary tour of guam and even more so, all of the fellow diners who added to the evening with explanations of guam and much shared camaraderie. Definitely make your way to prubechu and enjoy the social as well as the gustatory aspects of this fine new debut.\n\nThe interior of prubechu is warm and stylish, an amazing feat considering the surely skimpy budget of a start up restaurant. We really loved the whole experience, prices are outstanding for the quality, and staff is happy to share details about the food even while bustling for the growing crowd.\n\nBest wishes to all!", "author": "Kelly K."}

Shawn (one of two) told us that their cuisine has influences from Spain, US, Japan, and a slight bit of Pilipino. That odd combination of cultures sure did not disappoint when it came to the flavor palate.\n\nThe $40 tasting menu was totally worth it. 5 courses, an amuse bouche, and a dessert. The sous vide egg with asparagus and homemade rice crackers were amazing -- almost Californian, with a perfectly soft-boiled egg, and a nice texture contrast with the rice crackers. Their porridge -- oh my god, it was amazing at Roxie's and it's still amazing now -- they use 3 different \"grinds\" of toasted rice using a coffee grinder, and use all sorts of unique ingredients to taste the most amazing porridge I've ever had. Their beef short rib with noodles and a soy coconut broth -- I literally licked the bowl clean! Don't forget about their coconut ice cream -- I actually HATE coconut, but I couldn't get enough of this ice cream. Buttery and sweet, with toasted hazelnuts... the other Shawn said that it was their play on the Bi-Rite salted caramel.

This was a good amount of food, and although I am no culinary auteur, I did think that each dish in the tasting menu were unique and tasty and a breath of fresh air from all the American contemporary I've been accommodating lately. Hilights include the chicken kelaguen (their flatbread was delicious--I wanted a complete order of that alone lol), the succulent meat atop the porridge, the donni and finedene, and of course the Kadu. \n\nAs a Chamorro, I see this restaurant as an achievement. You will rarely see a Chamorro cuisine anywhere outside of Guam, and certainly not presented with a gourmet flair. And so to me it is a fantastic way to share our cultural foods and what they represent. When I ate here I could not help but feel so proud as flavors of certain meats transported me back to barbecues at my uncle's house, and the slurp of soups reminded me of my younger brother's favorite dish at home. Proud to have my friends visit this place and experience something that matters more and more to me as I get older. \n\nWhy the four stars? Only because I believe they can do even more and I look forward to the restaurant's evolution and growth. \n\nSide story:\nSix years ago I was rocking my Guam shirt at Bruno's right around the corner and a guy stops me and asks if I was from Guam. We get to talking and i remember him wearing a baseball cap in the club, that he was a student at the culinary academy in the city, and that his name might have been Shawn. \n\nMy coworker tells me about Prubechu and we immediately make plans to eat here a few days later and I walk in to see a sou chef, the host, and the head chef...rocking a baseball cap.

Not bad but a little salty. \n\n2nd course was the chicken kelegeun which was shredded chicken with spices on a flatbred. That was good. It would be good for light lunch or snack. \n\nFor our 3rd course, we were supposed to have a shrimp patty souffl\u00e9 but for some reason we didn't get it and they substituted some other vegetarian dish.  That was not to my liking. It had pickled cucumbers, some other vegetables and a dollop of cr\u00e8me fraiche. That was way too salty. I could have passed on that. \n\nI don't remember the names here on out, but 4th course was this smoked pork dish on some pureed starch. That was my favorite. The pork was very flavorful and savory. I could have eaten a large bowl of that for a meal. \n\n5th course was a dish of meat, rice, and vegetables served in a broth. That tasted like some comfort food that you would eat at home.\n\nLast course was homemade ice cream and coconut shavings. That was really good.

The problem for us was that the dishes didn't seem to compliment each other or show any kind of subtly -- almost every dish was super flavorable and very much the opposite of subtle. \n\nThen we got the bill, and I couldn't help but feel I'd had dozens of more delicious and cheaper, or at least equally priced, dinners (+drinks).", "author": "Ben G."}

We went with the tasting menu (very affordable!) for a casual sampling of dishes. I liked the shrimp patty with corn, the escabeche, and even all the coconut (which I usually don't) in the various dishes. I wasn't too fond of the porridge though, but maybe that's because I don't like it to begin with. Our server was really fantastic and took the time to explain each dish and answer any questions. He was also very informative and not at all condescending, which was really appreciated.\n\nAll in all, it's a great experience and for me, a chance to try a new cuisine. Would I return here all the time? Probably not. It's more a place I would go to every now and then and a place to take adventurous foodies.", "author": "Allison S."}

Flat bread with butter and yogurt sauce - size of my fingernail thumb.  ARE you serious?  It was about the 1/4 size of a triscuit!  It's just flatbread.  it tasted good.  But why give each person 1/4 size of something and put it on an individual plate and call it one of the courses.  This is how our meal started......I was thinking okay...palate cleanser...but no....\n\n2. Rice porridge with boiled egg with runny yolk...or at least some of us had runny yolk.  This was a much larger portion.  But rice is also cheap.  My biggest gripe with this course was the temperature.  The porridge wasn't hot...it was kinda luke warm....ALMOST warm.  it'd be nice to have it served hot and not have it congeal in front of me as I tried to eat it.\n\n3. Some broth with A mussel and house cured pork...SWEET?  doesn't work.  This is where i confirmed that they don't know how to balance flavors.  Way to sweet.  Again, this dish wasn't hot nor cold.  At this point I felt like I was being served cafeteria food...\n\n4. Some food with green sauce on the plate that tasted like crab but there was no crab in it.  Piece of over dried pork, again cured in house.  Tasted like eating a corner piece of meat that was sitting out on the counter for 2 days.  *Sigh*\n\n5. Dessert, the finisher, my boyfriend said this was the worst part of the meal.  TWO TINY pieces of tapioca that was dry, with a hint of sweetness, that summed up to the size of my pinky finger.\n\nOur table had 3 bottles of wine and that still left us critical about the meal.  My friend asked if we could go to Dr Teeth down the street because they have good chicken wings...\n\nAfter $90/pp, I felt bad for picking the place and felt like I wasted a nice dinning experience with friends.  Could've gone accross the street to Rosamunde for a beer and weiner.  \n\nSorry Purbechu...you royaly sucked.", "author": "Janet L."}

Everyone at our table got the $40 tasting menu...and we sounded like we were having an orgy. \"Mmmm ahhh ooohhh so good mmmm oh myyy godddd....\" After. Every. Dish. Didn't someone smart and profound say something about how good food is like good sex?\n\nNeedless to say, we were blown away by the quality of the ingredients (Dirty Girl Produce and shipped directly from Guam), the visual appeal and preparation of each dish, and the perfectly in-sync flavors. \n\nNow, let's talk about the flavors you may encounter. First, there is spicy...the Chamorros don't kid around with the hot stuff. They have their own kickass hot sauce that is very spicy (you've been warned). Then there is sour...as in tangy coconut vinegar liquor. I didn't even know this existed! And then there is creamy coconut to whisk you away to a white-sand beach on a deserted island...well at least in your mind. Spicy, tangy, creamy, with a bit of soy umami, and some smokiness too....definitely a sexy party.\n\n$40 seems like an incredible deal for what we got: 6 dishes (including a dessert) + an raw oyster amuse. We also ordered the pickles and keleguan. Though they were good, they paled in comparison to the tasting menu dishes. This review is already too long, so I'll just mention a few highlights from our tasting dishes: sous-vide quail egg, achiote porridge, smoked pork belly, pork jerky, soy-coconut broth, perfect spring peas, okra, eggplant, morels, COCONUT CANDY ICE CREAM.\n\nOur meal took almost 3 hours, so don't be in a rush. This place is easy to miss...look for the faded Roxy's Cafe sign. Credit cards accepted (via Square). Counter area overlooking the open kitchen area for walk-ins. Tables can be combined for large parties. Can get loud (see first paragraph).", "author": "Carolyn F."}

A friend brought me here recently and I had no idea what to expect walking in. The ambiance is calm, intimate and welcoming. All of the employees greet you with a smile and you can tell they are truly happy to have you as their guest. \n\nThe menu is very small, offering a tasting menu for $55 or simply ordering a few dishes. It is a little bit on the pricey side especially because the portions are small. But completely worth it because it is so delicious! I have never had food from Guam before, but each dish we had exploded with flavor. The combinations of ingredients in each plate are incredibly refined, I was thoroughly impressed. \n\nWe started off by sharing the empanada and then split two dishes. One of the dishes was all vegetables (I cannot recall the name) and the other by our servers suggestion was the Tinaktak beef with house made cappellini noodles, coconut milk and vegetables. Almost all of their dishes had a coconut infusion but they blended a lot of citrus flavors into it as well. I've just never had food like this before and was so amazing how much I loved it! Every single plate we had was so yummy!\n\nThe other thing I really loved about the experience was that with each dish that came out, someone from the kitchen came and described the dish in detail and how it was prepared. There's nothing I love more than dining at a place that is passionate about their food! I will definitely be back here many more times, I want to try the tasting menu next!", "author": "Mandy A."}

Someone we had tried to recommend the restaurant to, tried to make a reservation and they were told that they were closed.  The next time we went out for drinks in that neighborhood we stopped by to take a look, and were delighted to see Shawn with a new restaurant Prubechu that highlighted Guamanian food.  Now what can bet better than Shawn X 2.  This as been on our must eat list for quite a while and we finally got around to trying it.\n\nMy favorite dish from Roxy's was the porridge, which to me was the classic comfort food.  So naturally we had to order the tasting menu as the porridge isn't available a la cart.  The $40 tasting menu featured an amuse bouche (oyster), salmon crude, asparagus with as sous vided egg, a dish that is a take on sweet and sour topped with fish, porridge with smoked pork and a quail egg, short ribs in a soy and coconut broth, and coconut ice cream topped with toasted hazelnut for dessert.  My all time favorite is the porridge.  Typically Chinese porridge has a different grain, whereas this one is very fine almost like polenta.  Shawn explained that they use roasted rice at different grinds to give it a unique texture.  This dish is the ultimate comfort food, especially with the perfectly poached quail egg on top.  My other favorite was the short rib was the soy and coconut broth and noodles.  Also a very homey dish.  Just when you thought things wouldn't get much better, they surprised us with complementary ice cream.  The ice cream had a perfect texture contrast with the coconut in the ice cream, the roasted hazelnut, and the ice cream itself.  \n\nAlso the service is amazing.  Really it's like going to Cheer's where everyone knows your name.  Although I was heart broken to know that Roxy's had closed, I'm so glad to have Prubechu in the neighborhood.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Golai hagan suni is eggplant cooked in coconut milk and other veggies and it is absolutely fabulous. The salad is adequate and I did not care for the pulled chicken titiyas and the dried grilled pork...meh. The only dessert they had on the menu is coconut candy icecream.

I am Chamorro and was thrilled at the fact that there is such a restaurant.  Sadly, my family and I were very disappointed.  $70 for palaksi (parrot fish)?!?  Really?  At $4.99/per pound at the Asian market, they are not embarrassed to charge $70 for our parrot fish that was no more than 2 pounds.  I've never had a problem paying market price for seafood, which is usually no more than $35-$40 so we didn't even ask what the price for the parrot fish was.   Lesson learned...we will start asking now so we don't ever get ripped off again.\n\nWe also had the tinaktak which is ground beef with green beans in coconut milk.  I grew up eating tinaktak and often cook it myself.  We've always eaten it over rice. At Prubechu, tinaktak is served with pasta.  Okay, I get that they are somewhat a \"fusion\" type of restaurant but when I asked if I could have rice instead of pasta, the answer was no.  Another disappointment.  I am a paying customer and wanted a taste of home, not some fancied up non-traditional taste of home.  Especially when you are so far away from home and crave true Chamorro food.\n\nThe shrimp keleguin was good but the portion was very small for the price. \n\nOur bill was $163.00 not including the tip and we were not even full.  We were still hungry and ended up going to get tacos & burritos at another restaurant.\n\nI truly hope that Prubechu can stick to a more traditional Chamorro menu so that Chamorros who crave that taste of home (but are too busy at times to cook) can enjoy Chamorro food...and also, so that people of different ethnic backgrounds can truly taste and know just what Chamorro food is and just how delicious it is.  Being that there is only one Chamorro restaurant in San Francisco, there is no need to fancy it up and make it a \"fusion\" restaurant when our food is scrumptious all on its own...something to be proud of.", "author": "Kala C."}

The tasting menu offered some excellent dishes--poached egg porridge was quite tasty. Creamy and full of flavor. Most dishes had a lot of dimensionality with textures and flavors. There was one or two off the preset menu that weren't so impressive such as the clams which were just too salty and lacking anything special. Also the smoked pork was too tough, almost like eating beef jerky.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-22", "description": "Before dining at Prubechu, I really didn't know what to expect. Being that my girlfriend is from Guam, the only Guamanian cuisine that I've had was from her cooking. Thus, when I realized that Prubechu opened up this year and was the first and only Guamanian restaurant in NorCal, we couldn't pass up a chance to go. No only was our own hype there, the amazing Yelp reviews further solidified the anticipation.\n\nPrubechu is located on Mission between 24th and 25th. What I despise about the Mission is that it is incredibly hard to find parking here on the weekends. Luckily, within 5 minutes, I managed to magically find a spot around the block from the restaurant. When walking towards Prubechu, you might actually miss it because the sign is so incognito. As a frame of reference, it's next door to Quickly, which you absolutely won't miss. Upon stepping inside, you'll notice that Prubechu isn't a large restaurant by any means, but it sure is popular. Make sure to make a reservation beforehand, because I don't really see how you can snag a table otherwise.\n\nOnce we got seated, Shawn and his staff took care of us for our whole stay. For dinner, we decided to order:\n\n- Pickles (seasonal vegetables): $5\n- Chamorro Empanada: $7\n- Kelaguen Manok: $12\n- Tinaktak: $16\n- Red Rice: $18\n- Fried Fish: $22\n\nDessert: \n- Coconut Candy Ice Cream with Appigigi \n\nFor starters, the picked vegetables served as a good opening. They included: mango, papaya, radish, kimchee, and more. There was a nice spicy tang to each vegetable, and had that fresh homemade touch to it. Next up were the Chamorro empanadas. These are incredibly different from the empanadas that you're usually used to. Inside these bad boys was rice, achote, and mana. The empanadas were so taste that we ordered 2 additional to go. \n\nIf you're looking for some fresh tasting food, then the kelaguen is your dish of choice. This is Guamanian chicken ceviche with scallions and coconut, served on top of what resembles as a tortilla. Boy was this tasty. The chicken was juicy and combined with the citrus, it definitely made me want to order another round. If you're a coconut fan, then the tinaktak is for you. It comes served with homemade pasta. For my palate, it was a little on the thicker side, but I did enjoy the heavy coconut flavor that was associated with this dish.\n\nNext up were the red rice and fried fish. Paired with these dishes was finedine, a vinegar based condiment. The red rice was paired with their homemade bacon, which was literally thick slab of pork. It was loaded with flavor, and the rice itself was moist. When combined with the fried fish, you have a winning entree. To finish off our dinner, we had their coconut candy ice cream with appigigi. The ice cream had a nice sea salt sprinkled on top, and when combined with the pieces of tapioca, it balanced the dish out, leaving me incredibly satisfied with my meal.\n\nThroughout our meal, the service was attentive, the staff was incredibly nice, and of course the food was amazing. For Guamanian cuisine, there really isn't anywhere else you can go to in NorCal. Prubechu does the island a service by offering authentic tasting dishes to us Californians. Will I be back? You can bet on it.", "author": "Michael W."}

This is what I call an Exquisite Dining Experience.\n\nPrubechu is tucked unassumingly on bustling Mission St between 24th and 25th streets. Blink and you'll miss it. Its facade blends in with all the neighboring stores and restaurants. It looks even a little rundown, faded awning and letters peeling. It's not \"fancy\"; there's no modern decor or anything remotely close to stuffiness. It's homey and down-to-earth and welcoming. \n\nAnd the food will blow your mind.\n\nI came here with my BF after trying to find something more unique than the standardly nice \"Contemporary\" or \"New American\" restaurants that seem to be popping up all over the place these days. Don't get me wrong, all the hip new places are lovely, but I was looking for something that would take my taste buds on journeys they've never been on. Prubechu did that and so much more.\n\nWe opted for the 5 course tasting menu (really 7 courses with amuse bouche + dessert). It was one of the best meals I have ever had. All of the flavors combinations were inventive and fresh, novel uses of familiar ingredients and novel uses of novel ingredients (juvenile goatfish?! cilantro flowers?!). Coconut was incorporated in almost every dish, savory and sweet. There was spice, and tartness, interesting textures and creative use of garnishing. I'm unfamiliar with Chamorro cuisine but the staff took time to explain every dish in detail, and the cultural importance of the ingredients. They get most of their ingredients directly from Guam and it is clear that they really are trying to share a piece of their home with their diners. Everything was incredible, I mmmmmm'd and aaaaaah'd and pretty much licked every plate clean. I will be back again and again for sure.\n\nThe atmosphere is so laid back. There was no rush, each course came out at a reasonable but very leisurely pace. Servers were attentive and friendly and always down to chat, but otherwise let you hang out for as long as you want. My BF and I had a wonderful time. It was intimate and relaxed, but the food was beautiful and top notch. \n\nI hope Prubechu and the lovely people who own and work here all do exceedingly well!

We ordered the shrimp kelaguen, chicken kelaguen, soft shell crab with veggies with coconut milk, red rice plate with smoked beef and pork belly, empanada and the beef tinaktak pasta. Our 12 year old ate everything except for the shrimp. We let them know ahead of time that he had a shellfish allergy. \n\nThe tasting menu was different than when we were here in June and just had to order. My husband was blown away by the deep fried 6 minute egg (with a little Panko) with aioli over a sliced tomato and okra and chili pepper and house made spam. Didn't get to try the house made spam as our 12 year old snatched it right up. \n\nOverall, the dishes have its roots from Guam but have been elevated to a whole other level. \n\nMake sure to make a reservation.

However, being colonized by the Spanish for over 400 years, that influence pervades the cooking style.\n\nSo going to Prebechu, I had expectations of Guamanian or Chamorro, (the indigenous people of the Marianas Islands), the way I knew it. While I must admit that Prebechu's style isn't the most traditional, it certainly paves the way of updating and modernizing the traditional tastes and advances it to gourmet classification. The fresh approach remains true to the original tastes and yet, gives you a sense that something else had been heightened.\n\n- First of all, their presentation is spectacular using Asian style plates with playful variety to match the fare.\n\n- Second, the laid back island hospitality is something you can't duplicate and everyone that works there has roots going back to Guam.\n\n- Third, for those uninitiated with Guam food, you wouldn't have a  point of reference to compare, but for one who does know, it is an exalted version of the ubiquitous fiesta food.\n\nIt's a tad pricey if you ask me, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than the $1800 plane ticket to Guam to taste the unique dishes of the western Pacific islands.\n\nPlease support these folks for they've added another dimension to the gastronomic choices of cultural diversity in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-14", "description": "Nutshell Appraisal - High cost, low value establishment operated by well-intentioned but delusional proprietors, this spot, without a major shift toward improvement of customer experience, has absolutely no chance of being in business twelve months from now. Plethora of favorable Yelp reviews by so-called Elites within five days' time suspiciously points to platform gaming that smells of pay to play. \n\nAs a fairly adventurous diner who lives in the neighborhood, I thought I would give Prubechu a try. As the server rattled off tropical and Spanish influences, cuisines of the Philippines and Malaysia came to mind. Alas, the memorable and distinguishable ingredients and flavors that define these cultures' gastronomical identities and make them so appealing are not exhibited here.\n\nBecause my dining experience was so far removed from the stellar reviews consistently detailed by the first batch of Yelp reviews, I felt compelled to correct the record here.\n\nThe first thing you notice upon locating the property is that they've gone for the wink-nod move of retaining the badly-drawn marquee of the former downscale eatery that it has replaced. This is something of a gamble in that it sets the diner up for an expectation that the place is going to make up for this affront and seeming inattention to detail by wowing us with the dining experience itself. The expectation that you're about to bag yet another filling and cheap ethnic eats spot is looming large as you walk south down the still ungentrified block of the Mission shared with BART and McDonalds. A near-certainty reinforced once again upon actually finding the front door and seeing the interior's lack of d\u00e9cor or thought to table settings.\n\nThe first major shock, however, comes when the server steers you toward the signature prix fixe menu, offered at $40. Now, there's some considerable risk involved in diving into such a sizable investment with an unknown proprietor delivering relatively obscure cuisine. Even in high-cost San Francisco, $40 can still go a long way. Take the high-end, white gloved Basque-cuisine Piperade that offers impeccable prix fixe menus for under $40 on the edge of the financial district. \n\nAt this price point one expects a minimum quality of service. And as someone who spent a bit of time in the industry, I've always been a bit sensitive to lazy server moves such as auctioning off entrees when the dishes are presented to the table. When this happens with a party of just two, however, it's rather unforgivable as the server is clearly playing entr\u00e9e roulette. There were similarly awkward gaffs that cumulatively made for an unacceptable level of service.\n\nThe $8 bowl of potato soup was quite good. As was the $2 PBR we paired it with (declining not to risk the $12 glass of house red or white on offer). My best advice is to avoid coming too hungry or with anyone who's picky about dining out, and to stick to these two menu items. My $14 entr\u00e9e was smallish and had a bit of a \"what the cupboard has\" sensibility to it. Rather bland, it consisted of spaghetti topped by ground beef a la stroganoff with a sauce that appeared to be cream of mushroom soup and coconut milk along with diced asparagus added for good measure. Overall, we left hungry, poorer and wondering WTF, as we ambled up the way to backfill our still empty stomachs with empanadas and mezcal.", "author": "JayBee L."}

It's about time!\n\nA friend of mine had informed me that a new Chamorro restaurant was opening up in the Mission and at first, I thought he was totally kidding, but it turns out that he was absolutely right! \n\nPrubechu is a hidden little gem that does an amazing job of taking on traditional flavors and ingredients and creating a fresh, fun spin-off of classic Chamorro staples. Being part Chamorro myself, I, like many others swear that my (insert name of \"famed cook\" in the family here) makes the best chicken kelaguen, red rice, shrimp patties, etc, etc. But I must commend Shawn and Shawn for their thoughtfulness in creating such a simple, yet very tasty and satisfying menu. \n\nI was originally going to go with a few a la carte items, but ultimately chose to do the 5-course chef's tasting menu, which changes daily. Each course that came out was beautifully plated and explained to us in detail from both Shawn's. I truly cannot decide which dish was my favorite amongst them because everything was delicious in it's own way. Maybe it was the fabulous opening oyster with the kiwi mignonette.. or the slow cooked asparagus with the quail egg on top.. or the coconut milk monkfish kadu.. I can't decide; everything was amazing! \n\nThey also offer a nice little selection of beer and wine (including the hipster classic PBR), accepts credit cards via square and even takes reservations. Quick tip: I inquired about lunch service in the near future and they're currently working on getting more staff on hand to make lunch offerings a reality.. chicken kelaguen tacos, maybe?! \n\nIf you've ever wanted to dabble into Chamorro food, I recommend giving Prubechu a try the next time you're galavanting around the Mission. I'm super stoked that the city FINALLY has some authentic guamanian food on the grid and I wish these guys nothing but the best success!

Prubechu is an unexpected treat for the uninitiated!\n\nThe prix fixe tasting menu is an all-savory tour of the Island's food.  Our next table guest Norma was Guamanian and she said she cooks most of the dishes at home.  Legit!\n\nThe prix fixe has been really well reviewed so no taste-by-taste here.   Ingredient quality - super high.  Preparation - everything to-order and perfectly presented.  Flavor profile is a patois a bit like the Chamorro language - part Pacific, part Spanish.  Coconut in a variety of presentations and toastednesses complements pork, chicken, beef, corn, rice, noodles, mung beans, snap peas, carrots... a long list.  A different take on soy - YUM.  \n\nThe shrimp cake was deconstructed from fried to souffle... I would really like to get a chance to try both approaches side-by-side.

The decor is very reminiscent of authentic island laid-back style, totally unassuming in a way that makes you feel like you've found the local hot spot on the island. The service was great, with beautiful presentation and description of each item being placed, understanding that most visitors know nothing of Guam or its cuisine. Its also currently BYOB which is almost impossible to find with this quality of food. Onto the food...\n\nI came with 4 large hungry men and they all ordered the set menu for $40. It looked like too much food for me so I ordered the kelaguen. Each dish was unreal, and the men had trouble finishing all their food because it honestly is a lot of food for $40. I'm used to NYC set menus that tend to leave you hungry and curious as to whether you're just fatter and hungrier than the normal crowd. Not the case here. My kelaguen was delicious, a fairly healthy choice of minced chicken flavored with coconut and island spices, supposedly a very traditional Guamanian dish. I appreciate their great efforts in making a cuisine that most people are completely unfamiliar with and from a fairly laid back island culture into a series of beautifully and professionally presented small plates. Its no small feat to turn home-style island cooking into an elegant affair.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this place, particularly to people who are curious about other cultures and enjoy learning about different cultures via food.

In fact, some were so extraordinary, I had to shut my eyes to all else around me so I could really enjoy them. \n\nThe potato soup was simply to die for. Don't miss it. The shrimp keleguen...I could have eaten twice as many. The portions were generous yet I ate enough to share with one other person.\n\nWhat heightened the experience was meeting both owners, hearing their stories about Guam, and feeling the pride they have for their country. We could have talked for hours. Their love for food, creative adaptations of traditional dishes, and pure enjoyment of making sure we knew what we were eating and how everything was prepared turned what we thought would be a \"quick bite to eat\" into a 2 hour dining experience. \n\nEven my teenage son was interested in how things were made and came home to tell several friends and family about it.\n\nNeedless to say, the service was like being in someone's home.

Also, after a while it started to taste like a '1000 yr old egg'. I still enjoyed it a lot.\n\n3) Chicken keleguan - This was really good. It tasted like a very healthy chicken salad with some coconut dressing. \n\n4) Shrimp Patty - like everyone said, texture is more souffle than an actual patty. But i liked it. The corn mixed inside made it sweet. \n\n5) Chalakilis - very flavorful porridge, I got some big pieces of pork belly. So by this time I'm pretty full. Pork belly was really good, it was hot, crispy, and fatty. But not so much that I felt greasy afterwards. Then there was the quail egg, I don't know how they did it, but the yolk was still runny when I popped it in my mouth. \n\n6) Kadu - there was rice, some clear noodles, sprouts, potatoes, carrots, and short ribs. Then they top it over some soup and you can mix it with the vinegar they give you. It was delicious! It reminded me of korean kalbi soup. \n\n7) Homemade ice cream - Ice cream had a very natural coconut flavor. This was complemented with the cookie crumble and a torched meringue. Everything went very well together. \n\nOverall, food was good. I enjoyed the whole experience and each bite, but I don't think it's enough to make me dream about it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-15", "description": "After seeing such stellar reviews, I was strikingly underwhelmed by this experience. The emphasis seems to be highly on things that are considered excellent in Guam, without, in my opinion, much consideration for overall value or flavor.\n\nTried the ceviche, beer, wine, fermented coconut juice, red rice (their \"best seller\"- really? Rice?), and the market fish. Ceviche was nice but mild- relatively more bland than the average Latin ceviche, and less citrus-forward. The rice was entirely unremarkable. Perhaps the side portion is prepared differently than the entree (though we asked about this before ordering, and were told it is not), but it had hardly anything in it that wasn't... rice. The fish was the part of the meal that was really frustrating. For $38 (more than 1.5x the price of the next most expensive menu item, price not listed), we were served a small (~10oz bone in & head on), steamed reef fish. It was fine, but far too bland for my taste. We left feeling entirely unfulfillled to get ice cream down the street.\n\nOverall, this would perhaps be a very fine restaurant in Guam... but I would encourage prospective diners to consider that Guam is a tiny island in the deep Pacific, and not known for its cuisine. At San Francisco prices, you can do much, much better on this side of the ocean.", "author": "Jesse O."}

We appreciated that they asked about food allergies/dietary restrictions (we didn't) when we ordered.

I wish I had written down a description of each item, but overall it was a wonderful mix of flavor, texture, spice, smoke, seafood, pork, and fresh produce. Each course was unique and provided a new flavor--no filler courses here! The candied coconut ice cream was a perfect dessert for the 90-degree weather that day. One of the highlights of our experience was seeing the passion that the chef, co-owner, and servers had for the food and cuisine. They went into detail about history, sources, and cooking methods for each dish, answered all of our questions with enthusiasm, and were happy to share their story and backgrounds.

This item is the one thing that everyone at the table would return for.\n\nMy personal favorite was the house cured/smoked bacon w/ deep fried maitakes which tasted like meat ,which was awesome. Some in the group didn't like the dryness but I loved it.\n\nBraised oxtails -winner.\n\nThere was a leaf wrapped fish \"sausage\" thingy in coconut milk sauce that was kinda bland since I didn't use spicy sauce on the side.   It was too spicy for me to try twice. My Filipino  friend liked this dish. \n\nAlso a deep fried fish dish which was ok.  \n \nWe received complimentary ice cream and amuse buche oyster.

Request the donne dinanche (housemade pepper paste) to add a spicy kick to any of the dishes, and don't pass up the coconut candy ice cream for dessert - soooo good.\n\nFew critiques: They should offer a full pint glass when you order a beer versus a mini mason jar.

One cool thing that my brother ordered that sounded interesting was their homemade pasta with tinaktak (coconut milk, vegetables, and meat).

I'm always down to try new things, and seeing as how this is the first and only Guamanian restaurant I've heard of, I was intrigued. For groups of 5 or more, everyone has to be on board for the tasting menu. $45 gets you five courses, not including the amuse bouche and dessert. Fortunately, they allowed my friend to opt out of the tasting menu, and to just order a la carte because of her strong aversion to coconut (90% of their dishes have coconut). We didn't know what we were getting until each course came out because they didn't have a printed menu of the tasting menu. With the exception of one course (ground up chicken in banana leaf), we all thoroughly enjoyed the food! It was very flavorful and while coconut was in everything, it wasn't overwhelming and all that pronounced in some dishes (and I only like coconut in some foods). \n\nOverall, the service was good. However, it did take a really long time for the dessert course, around 30-40 minutes. When they forgot to sub my oxtail for fish, our server Shawn apologized and comped our bottle of wine. He really didn't have to do that, but we definitely appreciated it :) So even after eating Guamanian/Chamorro food, my friends and I still can't clearly define what it is.

It's a nondescript and fairly plain room in an otherwise great location, but the service and food was full of enthusiasm and authenticity and was one of the better meals I've had this year. First off a $45 7 course tasting menu is almost ludicrously cheap for this quality - it'd be a great deal at double the price.\n\nAs for the meal, it started off with an oyster amuse bouche - pretty standard but with the coconut vinegar it had a hint of Southeast Asia that set the tone for the rest of the night. Following was a cold smoked potato soup with more coconut coming through the creamy base. Next up was a Guamanian ceviche with some house made spicy chips and an oily ash base that grounded (literally!) the flavours. After that we had a house made chicken sausage that usually comes stuffed inside a chicken neck but for North American tastes was altered to be stuffed inside a banana leaf. Paired with a house made sriracha like sauce that gave the lightly seasoned protein bit of bite and we really started to realize this was going to be an unexpectedly memorable dinner. The fifth course was easily my favorite; a panko breaded soft boiled egg resting on top of house made \"spam\". Vaguely reminiscent of Wyly Dufresnes famous deconstructed eggs Benedict it was the simplest but tastiest dish of the night. But not by much...the penultimate course was a braised short rib on top of glass noodles surprisingly finished with a light broth. At this point I need to mention our server (who may also have been one of the co-owners). His dish descriptions were filled with phrases like \"my grandma's recipe\" and \"back home we eat it like this\", etc. It's clear these kids are cooking and running the front of house with a ton of passion and genuine love for Guamanian food. But it ain't over yet! Dessert was a coconut ice cream with some kind of fired tapioca that turned it into almost a biscuit or shortbread. Rad. \n\nAll in all a stellar meal.

But my ex is Chamorro and a lot of my friends are from Guam, so I've eaten homemade Chamorro on a number of occasions (i.e. Red Rice, Shrimp Patties, Keleguen, Tinaktak, etc.). No where I have eaten food like this. It's like amped up Guam food taking all the classics and making them exceptional. I love that the place is in the Mission, just a block away from Bart. You need to be aware of the address as the signage is not up yet, but I love that cause it makes it under the radar. I went for a going way dinner on a Wednesday night and we all did the tasting menu, which was amazing and to die for. I loved every single dish, so much so that I lost track of taking pictures and that's pretty bad for me since I'm #AsiansTakingPicturesOfFood. My highlights were the chilled corn soup with deep fried nori, Kadu with carrots and squash, Chicken Keleguen with shredded coconut and the Coconut Candy Ice cream was heaven. I devoured that Coconut ice cream after thinking I could no longer stuff anything else in me. Note that the Chef Tasting Menu changes based upon produce and recipe changes, but that's the best since you can always come back and enjoy another experience. Just sit back and let all these amazing dishes come to you.\n\nTips:\nOrder Chef's Tasting Menu ($45 -you will not regret it- very creative and super tasty)\nTake the Bart - get off at Mission and 24th (unless you want to fight for parking)\nTake notice of the address- no sign up yet\nCausal but Intimate scene", "author": "Jennifer Y."}

Now, since this is my ONLY time trying this cuisine, I can't speak to its authenticity or whatever, I just know it is pretty dang tasty. As unusual as this may sound, it felt like a cross between American southern barbeque (just a bit, a lot of smoky flavors) and a more restrained Thai cuisine (a lot of coconut used but less sweet). Oh mama, that's a good combo.\n\nI, like many others, got the prix fixe five course option. It's not extremely filling, but you get to try a lot of different things, and they were all pretty great. My companion and I split that and we also got the red rice plate, which is a big plate of food, in stark contrast to the tasting menu. So, get the prix fixe for variety, order another plate if you want a big hearty meal. \n\nI should also mention the service, which was uncommonly personable and warm. And for a fairly nice restaurant, it was refreshingly lacking in pretense. Great experience, an underrated restaurant in the Mission that I suspect will become overcrowded sometime in the future.", "author": "Dustin Y."}

They don't have that in Guam is it something they made up? Being from Guam , 100 % Guamanian / Chamorita everyone knows we make our food from our grandmas & moms recipes, we cook our food to represent our culture \"the CHAMORRO People\"so to make this little bit of food when Chamorros are known to have big parties or fiesta this was a disgrace. We had the chef's choice spend over $200 for 2 people that was a rip off! Also never spent that much money & still was hungry & got food right after , we left at Chevys across from the W. I'm not sure how they are making it ? but I wouldn't pay another penny to eat at this place if it was the last thing on earth. The place is small doesn't feel like Guam hospitality more like a Japanese sushi house right on the mission. Not sure where they got their recipes but definitely NOT representing our culture ! The reviews must be by NON-Chamorro customers & friends of owners because there is no way they represent GUAM. What is fusion anyways?", "author": "Lani A."}

I whipped out my phone to double-check the Yelp reviews and that convinced me to try the place out and overlook the ambiance. And I'm glad I did. So thanks everyone!

We were served 7 carefully prepared entrees.  The dishes are designed to be savored, internalized and then discussed.  That was part of the charm and allure.  Of course if it didn't taste good than then what would be the point?  I really liked the corn chowder?/soup and the home made Spam with eggs salad (guys from  Hawaii this is not your mother's Spam and egg). Fresh ingredients/creative taste combos.

Whether that's the case here or it's just a display of irrepressible talent, the result is fantastic.

The food and beer were great too. The ambiance was slightly island like (not over the top) which in SF = JOY. The restaurant temperature was pleasantly cozy (not hot) - which I find rare in SF... I'm usually sitting in any SF restaurant freezing. But they closed the front door I could take off my jacket and I amazingly felt so comfortable. (As a girl in SF so often you go out and your whole outfit is just covered up by the coat you have to wear in order not to freeze!) The other warm thing they do is play this lovely fun music that puts you completely at ease. The service is perfect, friendly, efficient, relaxed. I'd recommend the Tinaktak (coconut braised beef, hand made pasta), or the tasting menu which looked amazing (hope to try it next time.) Also they have a delightful beer selection!

By no small feat are many of the dishes simplistic, in fact preparation for much of what we eat is time consuming.  Prubechu has taken what is already great food and made it GRAND!  The succulent flavors from each dish burst out and compel you to want more.  As if the 5 course tasting menu was enough, NO!!!!.....we had to venture further into their simple but seductive and enticing menu and order more.  Then they top it off with ice cream and not Blue Bunny, Hagen Das or Bryers but their own, homemade....coconut candy and melon ice cream lightly sprinkled with salt that was made on Guam.

We got the tasting menu and it was really really good. It was 5 or 6 dishes that were a total surprise-- they won't tell you she's of time what you'll get but they ask for any allergies or aversions. Our tasting was comprised of a flat bread, shrimp ceviche soup, chicken sausage and red rice, fried egg on a bed of housemate spam (this was so good-- it had a soy sauce and sesame glaze that was perfectly crystalized), braised beef and a tapioca coconut dessert. Oh and pretty much every dish has coconut as an ingredient, so if you don't like coconuts this isn't the place to go. The service was also great-- our waiter was really nice and patient as we asked a bunch of questions-- none of us knew anything about Guam cuisine. One downside is they only have beer and wine (don't think they have a liquor license?) so if you'll looking for a cocktail might need to go elsewhere.
