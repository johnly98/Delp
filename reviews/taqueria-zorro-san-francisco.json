I like to watch my dollars and for less then $10 you can get a descent burrito with all the fabulous trimmings. Of course the super burrito is a dollar more but you get pretty full just off a regular burrito.

This place isn't an El Farolito but will satisfy your burrito craving for sure.\n\nThey have plenty of seating. The vibe is very homey with the traditional music and portraits on the walls. The staff is friendly.\n\nParking around here is tough, but it is a definitely an easy walk if you work nearby. \n\nMy suggestion for a parking is to park a few blocks away and walk towards Broadway street.

Decent sized overstuffed burritos for nine ish bucks? Yes, please.\n\nFresh things. Do I really have to expand on this ? I do? Really? Ok, whatever, they have a great do it yourself salsa bar with a half dozen different options. That is always a wonderful thing to find in a taqueria. But wait there's more-the prep area in addition to being extremely visible (you walk/stand/wait by it before you get to the cashier for ordering.) is always hot and fresh. Nice. They also have a house burrito which is kind of a fusion item. Burrito with fries in it. Just what the late night carbaholic needs.\n\nThe Mural. The dining area sports a full wall mural of an episode from Aztec mythology, replete with bathing maidens and leopard men. Bonus points for the little marker explaining the scene.\n\nThings that I'm overlooking for now but otherwise may cost a star or two:\n\nThe dining area can suffer from sticky table top syndrome, especially during the lunch and late rush times. \n\nThe staff can be a tad overworked, and thus will not respond to erratic herbal/beer impaired ordering with zestful enthusiasm. \n\nThe bathrooms are down a flight of stairs.

Both meats were tender and flavorful.\n\nMake sure to grab some salsas from the Salsa bar. They have Habanero sauce, Jalapenos, Green sauce & Red sauce.

I understand that human error can happen and we could've looked at the receipt to make sure that she put in the order correctly, but regardless, when you expect to get one thing and get another, you get a little disappointed (even then, the title of the food just read \"2 Carne Asada Zorro Bur\" which by glancing at it, you would think that your ordered is right). \n\nMy friend and I said oh well, we were hungry, and the carne asada fries were essentially the inner body mass of the zorro burrito. I opened mine and found mine to be not well wrapped. This caused my burrito to fall all of its bits out and into the plate and from there I finished it with a fork. Not exactly an ideal situation if you were to order a burrito. The burrito itself wasn't that at all, just a little strong in flavor to my taste. I feel that maybe they added a little too much onions on mine. \n\nOverall, I would give this place another shot to see what the Zorro chips are like and see what is the difference. If it impresses me, I'll come back. If not, I'll try find another place to eat that's near to the Exploratorium.", "author": "Tito G."}

Instead I asked for a refund. As far the carne asada burrito goes, they never made it for me, so I also got a refund. \n\nI understand how tough is working at a place like this, with only one cashier and two cooks. I been there, but how can you forget to serve me a burrito when we are the only ones there? How can you tell me there is tortas and then once i think my food is coming you inform mw there is no bread?

The salty seasoning was balanced nicely with the lime and the pickled red onion. Throw in some red cabbage for crunch and texture, you've got perfect balance of flavor and texture in every bite. It's now a toss up between the carnitas and fish tacos for me here.\n\nNot everything is a hit here - I found the lengua to be a little tough.

However, what came was an utter disappointment. \n\nOrdered the following:\n2 pollo tacos\n2 carnitas tacos\n1 carne asada taco\n\nAll meat was seasoned with the same seasoning. How do I know? I found a bay leaf in both the chicken and pork tacos. All tacos were weighed down with lettuce making them mini salads.  This was disturbing because lettuce was not in the description on the menu.  The chips tasted bought and not home made, which is beyond confusing to me. They tasted like chips from a local delivery service that delivers to many taqueria's around the city.

They aren't bad, but they aren't amazing either. I have been to this establishment many times, as I work nearby, and each time has been almost disappointing. They are also pricey for burritos, but I think that has more to do with their location than anything else. Most places near North Beach are pretty expensive unless you count the dirt-cheap Chinese stores a block over. \n\nSome days for lunch, I get a sudden craving for a good burrito. While I'm dreaming of El Farolito's or Taqueria Guadalajara, I head to Zorro's because they are close and I don't get long breaks. They're located near several strip clubs and if you keep walking up Columbus you'll find a tasty place called Pizzelle Di North Beach. There have been days I have walked to Zorro's for lunch, stood in the doorway for a second, then kept walking to Pizzelle's. That is how unremarkable Zorro's is. \n\nI've had their tacos once, and haven't tried them since. It was as if they were inedible. \n\nNormally I go for their burritos. They are not only crazy bland most days, they are also ridiculously messy. The tortilla is greasy and flaky, but somehow also doughy? The inside is just a mess. The whole thing usually falls apart halfway through and I end up having to pick up bits of onion and meat and pretend I'm eating my meal like the adult human being I am. \n\nSo why give this place three stars instead of two? \nWell I've mentioned this place is close to where I work, and the staff is pretty friendly. \nThey have juice there, which I actually like. Horchata's a disappointment, but I like their pineapple or mango juices. They're cheap and watery. \nUnlike some taquerias, Zorro's will include a little bag of chips with your order of a burrito. I think they put it in for you to scoop up the bits of your burrito after it disintegrates to a pile of mush. \nThey are open late, like most places on Broadway and Columbus. \nFinally, despite the criticisms I've given, they ultimately do what they set out to do. They make burritos. While this seems like a small thing, I appreciate that there's a wide selection of food in the area. It would be so easy for NorthBeach/Chinatown to become a sea of the same overpriced Italian and underpriced Chinese food, and the occasional milk tea joints sprinkled in.

If you think \"ewe, gross!\" to the idea of eating tongue than you have absolutely no right to even talk about food.  Lengua is incredible; it's moist, fatty, has a great texture, etc. etc.  You will not go back to carne asada, carnitas, or whatever else you usually get.  The lengua is fresh too!  How do I know?  They run out of it frequently but replenish their supply regularly.  I go regularly and they are out about a third of the time, if I go back the next day after they are out of it they usually have more!\n\nThey have daily specials: Monday is Quesadilla Day ($6.50 for any kind), Tuesday is Taco Day (tacos are cheaper but still too small to be worth it), Wednesday is Burrito Day (all burritos are $6.50, even wet super burittos!), and Thursday is Torta Day (get a free soda with your torta!).  Wednesday is the best special by far.\n\nTheir regular menu has most of the standards of a NorCal Mexican place.  Their burritos are really good, tacos not so much, quesadillas are not as good as the burritos but still good; the true gem, however, is their Taco Salad which is freaking awesome.\n\nThe taco salad comes in a big fried tortilla bowl filled with all kinds of goodness.  The bottom layer is a mix of your choice of meat, beans, and rice and it's covered with a very nice salad and usually topped with cheese.  Usually topped with cheese?  Yep, sometimes they forget and that inconsistency is where they loose a star.\n\nIf there's one problem with Zorro it's the inconsistancy; I've been charged different amounts for the same food on different days and each chef seems to do their own variation on each dish.  You never know exactly what you're getting but it's always good and always in the ballpark of what their menu claims.\n\nOther problems?  A lot of the bums wander in here and try to take your food.

Rice and beans (your choice of refried, pinto or black) with melted cheese on top.  Shredded lettuce with a big slice of tomato on top.  A stack of hot, soft tortillas.\n\nThe eggs were delicious - slightly spicy and seasoned so no salsa or pico was needed.  The rice and beans were also flavorful.  Salsa bar had awesome spicy green salsa.  Potatoes were better than your average breakfast joint.  No line at 12:15 PM.\n\nOne star off for slightly higher prices, no crunchy tacos, cash only, and a basket of chips cost $1.  My friend's enchiladas were deemed bland, so he had a blast finishing up my dish (and trust me, it's a HUGE platter).  Also, no tamales?

I tried this place during the day, at night, during the week, and on the weekends. Each time I astonished at how bad the food was. All of the ingredients taste like they came out of an old can. The decor - cheesy and unauthentic. And the service - was on par with the type of service you get from a fast food restaurant. \n\nPlease heed my warning. The next time you're thinking about stopping by here, do yourself a favor and go lick the stripper pole at Little Darlings next door. I'm sure you'll find the taste more appealing than anything Zorro could produce, and there's less of a chance of  \"catching something.\"", "author": "Michael H."}

I had much pride in the California burrito from my hometown, but as fate would have it, I drunkenly stumbled into this place while I was visiting some friends in SF.  Much to my surprise, I saw the California burrito on the menu and I thought to myself, \"there's no way this is the same burrito as the one from SD.  AND there's absolutely no way it'll taste nearly as good.\"  But I had to try it, so I ordered one.\n\nWell, after what seemed like a long & arduous wait for my drunchies to arrive (frankly, it was probably only about 4 or 5 minutes), the burrito finally came.  Tearing through the layers of aluminum foil, my heart was beating insanely fast... most likely because I had way too much to drink and I get massive Asian glow.  Anyway, I finally got past the aluminum foil to the warm tortilla, and I poured a little bit of the green sauce on top before biting down.  \n\nHOLY FLAVOR EXPLOSION BATMAN!  I hadn't had a burrito this good... ever!  I didn't believe it.  So I took another bite, and another.  And my friends ate some too.  Then they kept eating more.  Everyone was stunned.  Shocked.  Flabbergasted.  We couldn't believe just how amazingly delicious this burrito was!\n\nThe next day, we were still thinking about the burrito.  We decided that there was no way a California burrito in SF could be better than one in SD, so we went back again... completely sober.  This burrito had high expectations to live up to.\n\nAnd did it ever.  Wow.  The second time was just as good as the first!  I now have a new favorite burrito place.  Unfortunately, it's 500 miles away.", "author": "Yu T."}

The chicken had good flavor but the problem was for one, the salsa they put in was very spicy. I can take it but that night I had been drinking and the last time I wanted was spicy food! There were too many juices which result in the tortilla to get soggy towards the middle to end of the burrito. And three, the burrito is wrapped with like 5 layers of tin foil!

There is a general sense of DGAF about proportion and ratio of rice, beans, meat to the size of the tortilla for the result to be stellar. By the last dollop of guacamole, you already know there's a lot of love - almost too much love to wrap and you're thinking, \"There's no way he can make this work; there's so much food and not much tortilla!\" And your thoughts are spot on. The guy folds one part of the tortilla over, realizes he can't complete the job right, and literally uses the foil to smush everything together and hold it tight. This happens every time. \n\nAnd personally, I really enjoy Gordo's burritos and really appreciate them even more every time I visit TZ. Why? Well, Gordo's puts cheese on the tortilla when they heat the tortilla so it melts nicely. TZ heats the tortilla, adds all the other stuff, then the cheese, smushes the burrito, and then heats it again the steamer. The cheese is still not melted and then it just tastes weird. \n\nIt always feels a little dirty sitting inside, but when you're in the mood for a burrito, you just have to eat it right away.

Not good, as apparently Santa doesn't carry cash.  We ran into some younger kids that were totally amped on Santa costumes, and they directed us to Taqueria Zorro.\n\nOh how wise these kids were, a regular Carne Asada burrito with no rice, and cheese later and my belly and soul were appeased.  They've got a pretty good salsa bar, with a few choices, each one tasty and fairly mild.

The place was of his choosing. He had already covered the mission and needed to branch off. So there we were, real San Franciscans, sitting in a tourist trap ordering some hella expensive mexican fare. But what the hell do you expect? It's in North Beach, and you know what for being in North Beach it's really not all that bad. \n\nMy friend the burrito expert found that the burrito was too loosely rolled. However, he found it excellent that they had a variety of beans and he really enjoyed their chorizo. I was not a fan of the dry beans in my taco and had to pretend that they were really the beans served at La Taqueria in order to make the best of the experience. A large amount of sour cream and cheap shaved lettuce accompanied my taco. Fortunately I was hungry enough not care about visual aesthetics. \n\nAll and all, if you're drunk in North Beach and don't want to pay the big bucks for some unrememberable tourist food get your ass over here.

And Ill be damned if the tacos here aren't more foxy than anything in the strip clubs nearby.  (Just a hunch)  Watch now as our cunning hero outfoxes authority, outsmarts foxy foes and outrageously eats four tacos in a sitting...\n\nOur Backdrop:  \nIn the true spirit of Don Diego de la Vega, Taqueria Zorro defends the people of North Beach against tyrannical touristy Italian joints and provides a safe haven for ravenous intoxicated travelers.  On a brisk Thursday evening, a mysterious masked man manages to slip past the sirens that lure the lost travelers into dungeons of lust and destitution.  With football flashing on the big screen and the scent of spices sifting from the salsa bar, our hero dashes past the damsels and into the taqueria's dining room ... undetected.\n\nOur drama unfolds: \nHungry after a few hours of swashbuckling with the bumbling authorities and charming damsels in distress, Zorro arrives and orders not one but two carne asada tacos.  With a side of ... a chicken taco.  Oh and one al pastor.  And better get one of those $10 dollar corona buckets.  The villagers gasp.  \n\nOur conclusion:\nZorro is too cunning and foxlike to be stopped, and he delights in publicly humiliating those who doubt his dedication.  The tacos fall in rapid secession - prey to a swift crack of his whip or slash with his sword.  He has never met a taco here that he hasn't seduced.  This night was no different.   The bottles sat sadly in their bucket.  Now only limes where beer once beckoned.  The villagers cheered - knowing once again they had witnessed the legend.  And the dancing damsels were then freed from their dungeons to run away with our dashing hero.  A few pounds heavier, some salsa on his cape, and a sharp smell of onions on his breath.  But as foxy and unpredictable as ever.   \n\nOur moral (or lack thereof):\nYou, too, can stop by Zorro and have a tasty taco for (or four) yourself.  And someday, if you are lucky, or better yet in distress, you may catch a glimpse of our mysterious masked hero and legendary cunning linguist yourself.  \n\nZ", "author": "Brad C."}

But after maybe 6 or 7 burritos, I have to say that I've never had one that I'd call \"good\".  \"Adequate\" is as far as I'm going to go.  \n\nHere's the deal: I eat stripped-down burritos (I'm a vegan), so I'm really interested in them getting the basics right.  They only have plain flour tortillas, so nothing special there.  Their refried beans are bland -- seemingly without any flavor or richness.  Their rice is not only bland, it's consistently undercooked.  Few things I hate more than crunchy rice in a burrito!  Their guacamole is almost more of a salsa, with chunks of undercooked onions and other things in it; it's also runny.  Inexplicably, although they grill their tortillas, once they wrap them in foil, they steam them!  This, of course, makes the tortilla gummy.  No idea.\n\nTo top it off, this burrito is more than $5.  And they don't take plastic, but they do have an ATM machine that will gladly keep $3 for the privilege of giving you your money.  Grrr!  And the interior is as charmless and dingy as...er...a taqueria, but in say, the Tenderloin.\n\nI'll probably eat at Zorro again, and I'll undoubtedly complain about it every time I do.

Sauces could be better and the chips, that you get as appetizers before your food is ready, taste like crap.\n\nFood is good, above average, service is great.\n\nTres Estrellas!\n\nciao", "author": "Daniel C."}

For under $7, I would get a Carnitas Super Burrito to go and that would fill me up until the evening time. The Burrito packed a nice punch and the meats were very tender and flavorful. \n\nI believe this place started getting a ton of business from their $1 Taco Tuesday, which is now $1.50, but it was totally worth it as they didn't skimp on the meat or fixings. This drew a huge crowd and now, I believe their attention to the food has drastically fell through. \n\n\nThe Burritos are not as tasty anymore and they completely jacked the prices up. The customer service is not up to par and its completely disgusting when you find corn in the middle of your burrito, come on now CORN!", "author": "Thomas J."}

We were wearing giants clothes but we were both sober and did not act the slightest bit unruly. i placed my order and my boyfriend said he will have the same thing. when the food was brought to the table 1 of the items was completely the wrong item, no big deal at all but i let her know in case it was supposed to go to someone else since our order was so simple. the waitress told me i was wrong and that this was what i ordered, still fine.. its just a take out burrito place so i didn't care all that much even though i was annoyed that i paid $9.75 and she would not even acknowledge she may be wrong. before she and i could conclude our very quick conversation i had the receipt unexpectedly grabbed from my hand and to my surprise found a VERY large security guard hovering over me (literally inches away and over my body as i sat in a seat). he was very aggressive and approached the situation as if i were causing a scene and about to start a fight or something. i was baffled, still am.. almost cant express in words. what started as me having a quiet conversation with my waitress turned into a man 3 times my size threatening me with his body presence obviously as a signal for me to shut up. i began to explain that we just had a mix up in the order but he didn't want to hear anything.. still standing his forceful ground over me within inches he demanded i either eat the burrito \"i ordered\" or get out. \n\nWHAT KIND OF SERVICE IS THIS!!!!! i am a 5'3\" girl who came in, paid and clarified to my waitress i was given the wrong food then was basically threatened by a rent a cop 3 times my size to shut up and get out or he would make me. if i had been a vegetarian and was given my item i would have to leave without food because no one would listen to me. \n\nit was to the point where my boyfriend was silent the whole time with a stunned look on his face. afterward he said he didn't want to say anything because the approach that the security guard took indicated he would get physical if we said anything. \n\nwe used to be regular customers to Taqueria Z and will never go back. if you support your employees acting in this manor i assure you, your customers have no business spending money there.", "author": "Barbara C."}

But, I had a 2-for-1 burito coupon and my appreciation for value trumps my porn/food mixing rule.  Anyway, the place offers 10 kinds of meat and the interior was not bad.  Lots of Mexican patrons, soccer on the TV, and colorful decorations on the ceiling gave an air of authenticity.  The carne asada was good and the other meats I saw on other tables looked appealing; I just thought my burito was a bit soupy.  I will ask for no beans next times as I believe they were the culprit.  It was a satisfying experience, but nothing to rave about.  With a 3 rating, I basically say \"If I'm in the area and in the mood for this type of food, it's a fine choice\"  Other people in my party liked it more than me, so probably can be considered a good potential for an upgrade if I ever go again.  http://taqueriazorro.com/", "author": "Marc S."}
