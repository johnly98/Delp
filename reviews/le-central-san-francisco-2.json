I arrived before my friend and I was a tad suffocated by the staff, who asked me at least 5 times if I wanted to order a drink. However, I realize that they were trying to be attentive.\n\nOnce my friend arrived we had a delicious dinner. I started with the onion soup. Ohhh my god. I love a good onion soup, and boy was this delicious. My friend had a salad and she was satisfied. For our main, I got the burger which was really good, and my friend got the filet, which was lovely. They had a really good sauce on the steak, which we both loved. Both meats were cooked to our liking and we enjoyed it very much. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate mousse which was outstanding.

Lunch still packed with power house folks, a classic spot by China Town entrance, and something about this historical place, just nice to be back once awhile. \n\nThis is 1 of the oldest restaurants in San Francisco, classic French Bistro, famous for their casserole, 15,567 days since the cooked that pot.

We stumbled on this restaurant. When we walked in we were greeted by the bartender behind the bar and he pointed to a table and we proceeded to sit ourselves. We were greeted several minutes later by a server that had little to no knowledge of the menu and wine list. Or he just didn't want to be bothered with talking to us. He was rushed, distracted and was not engaging. \n\nWe started with a CA house cab which was $48 and very tasty. From there we had escargot and sourdough bread. The appetizer was garlicky, buttery and yummy. \n\nThe second course was a butter lettuce salad with nothing exciting to speak of. The third course was a French onion soup ($12) which was very mediocre. For the restaurant being French cuisine, I expected a top notch soup. \n\nNext, was the main, beef bourgeoisie and the duck confit special.

It was pretty easy to make a reservation via open table here since I did book it one week prior to the event. Most places were already booked out. \n\nThis place is pretty small. The tables for two were very crammed to the point where our host had to pull our our table for me to get into the booth. We also sat very close to the tables beside us so don't expect to have privacy or intimate conversations while dining in. Service was decent. The food was pretty tasty! We had the Vday Prime Fixe menu. I ordered the lobster bisque to start off. It was meh. Creamy, pretty tasteless. Bread that came with the meal was super hard/stale. I had the lamb racks as my main. Very juicy and tender, goes well with the sauce. The potato gratin was very delicious as well. Finally, I finished the meal with their creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Very generous portion. Tastes great.

There are so many new, trendy restaurants in San Francisco, and French food isn't usually high on my list. But I was very pleasantly surprised by Le Central!\n\nThe atmosphere is warm and feels a lot like the bistros you'd see in the streets of Paris--it was fun to feel transported when we walked in. They also have a good happy hour deal on house wines but you have to order it at the bar, can't get it at your table!\n\nThe cassoulet was definitely the standout. It's quite heavy--I split it with another person and it was still a lot of food. I'd actually suggest three people go for it and then get sides. But the flavors were excellent, it was comforting, and not something you find at most restaurants in San Francisco. We also had the butter lettuce salad which was delicious, the french fries which were really good, and the escargot because when at a French restaurant, go big or go home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-11", "description": "A solid place for French food in the heart of San Francisco's downtown. I have seen the outside Le Central for decades now driving on Bush Street heading back to the East Bay in my car but this was the first time I had walked from the Montgomery Street BART station and eaten at Le Central and it was all thanks to San Francisco Restaurant Week. A friend and I wanted to meet up to commemorate another great year and so we looked on the website to see what affordable options that were out there that sounded good but also didn't break our wallets and we found a really solid option with Le Central.   \n\nUpon entry I noticed that Le Central could resemble a local watering hole in any American city or small local restaurant in Paris. It was cozy and warm without coming across as too pretentious. There was a huge long bar on one side of a double sided restaurant with small two top tables and booths abound. As for their menu they seem to have a number of dishes that best represent the best of what Parisian flair has to offer. Their San Francisco Restaurant Week menu best exemplifies some of the dishes they serve at a fairly decent price point. Where else could you get Escargot, Beef Bourguignon, and a Chocolate Mousse for only forty dollars total? No where in San Francisco outside of that ten day period every January.\n\nSince this was SF Restaurant Week and we were here to take advantage of the meal deal they were offering up I had to go with the traditional Onion Soup Gratinee with a boatload of Gruyere cheese and herb croutons this starter was just the way I like my French Onion Soup, gooey and cheesy.  As for my second course I debated between the Beef Bourguignon and the Cassoulet. Against my better judgement I went with the Cassoulet, with its white bean stew topped with duck confit, shreds of lamb and pork and served with one half of a Toulouse sausage. I felt that the dish, although well prepared, was filled with too many beans for my liking and not enough meat protein. Thankfully, there was plenty of baguette bread to go with my bean stew because I was in serious search for a starch to go with my main course and the beans weren't doing it. The dish does go well with the Cotes du Rhone red wine that I was able to purchase at the discount price of 5 dollars thanks to it being Restaurant Week. My dining companion got the Petrale Sole topped with lemon-butter-caper sauce, and served with cauliflower gratin and fingerling potatoes. She loved it and I had a small bite and loved how lightly pan fried the fish was. To finish off our meal, we each ordered both dessert options I liked the Mousse au Chocolat which was a chocolate mousse topped with both a creme chantilly and two rolled gaufrette pastries. But the real delight was the Souffle Glacee which was a chilled lemon souffle and berry compote. It was a light dessert without being overly sweet.\n\nI liked Le Central which of course is centrally located in between the Financial District and the entryway to Chinatown. An uncomplicated French Bistro the middle of the chaotic hustle and bustle of the city. Their menu deals for San Francisco Restaurant Week were solid for the price and hope they got more business than usual because of it. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be sure to stop by and sample some of their other dishes on their regular menu, all of which sounded rather delicious. Merci Le Central!", "author": "Jason F."}

We were a party of 13, I chose the place because it is easily accessible for everyone coming from work. We were there for both happy hour and dinner. Some of us  started ordering happy hour drinks at the bar but then the Manager rudely told us that we cannot order happy hour drinks anymore because we had reservation at the dining area. Hmmmmm, we are regular San Franciscan diners and we are very familiar about having happy hour drinks at the bar vs dining area. Fair enough . We understand this and it's common practice but to be told that we cannot be served anymore in the bar area is simply ridiculous. We usually run up a bill close to $800- $1,000 because we start with happy hour and stay for dinner .The Manager made a big mistake making assumptions that we are only there for \"happy hour\". The place was empty on a Friday night and they should have been more accommodating instead of being uptight about the whole thing.

As it is in downtown SF, it should get no easy grades - San Francisco is a sophisticated city with many good restaurants across the spectrum of food, so standards by which this restaurant is to be graded are high.  It is sufficient.\n\nFor dinner, there were escargots (average), oysters (above average), and scallops (average) for me.  I did also have a ginger/carrot soup (above average).  This was all chased by several shared bottles of white burgundy, which I found cold and charming of course, but the vintage escapes me and I did not handle the wine list, so I can't comment on their wine selections.\n\nFor lunch, I had a filet mignon plate (above average).\n\nAs for service, it was adequate and there were no disappointments - particularly for the dinner.

We first came for Happy Hour, which is only available in the bar, and then stayed for dinner at a table. Happy Hour was great. First of all it was available on a Saturday so it's not just during the week, and it went until 7pm! We had wine, brie, oysters, frites, and had a great time. It's an awesome happy hour deal with lots of yummy food to snack on for cheap! Dinner, on the other hand, was not as impressive. There was nothing wrong really, it just wasn't as good as the happy hour in my opinion. The French Onion Soup is made with gruyere cheese which smells so bad. I think a couple of their other dishes are also made with this cheese, because we kept getting whiffs of this funky smell when certain plates went past us. The soup I got was mostly bread and cheese, with very little actual soup. I got the impression the rest of our party felt similarly about their orders...good, but not great or worth the priciness. So in conclusion, I would definitely come back here and recommend Le Central for happy hour, but I would probably choose a different spot for dinner.", "author": "Nicole D."}

The reservation was made a full four days in advance.  When I arrived with my out-of-town guests, all of whom were of a sylphlike slenderness, the restaurant attempted to seat us at a makeshift table set in the middle of the dining room that was best suited for six adults at best.  When we asked to be moved to a reasonably sized table, the staff kept us waiting for more than 20 minutes.  \n\nNow, normally, we are willing to cut our home town restaurants a large amount of slack during the holidays.  HOWEVER, in the dining room there were many tables on the banquette that could have been moved together immediately to accommodate us.  Why were they not?  Because the staff was more worried about a party of seven that had not arrived - and several other parties of two that had not arrived - than they were with the party of eight standing directly in front of them.  \n\nFinally, after three reminders that we were still waiting, the staff did, indeed, move the banquette tables together to accommodate us.  And they did not do it cheerfully, nor even politely.\n\nAnd guess what?  The party of seven never showed, nor did many of the other parties the staff were expecting.  During the entire meal, there was no line at the door.  Un tien vaut mieux que deux tu l'auras, Le Central.\n\nBy the way, our tab came to $1,200 for the party of eight, so its not like we were a poor risk.\n\nAs regular customers, we expected that Le Central would be a solid place to bring out-of-town guests in terms of both food and service.  It was an incredibly irritating and embarrassing experience.  I won't be back, and considering how often I have eaten at Le Central over the years, this is a strong statement.\n\nAs an aside, the wine list, in terms of the selection of French wines by the bottle, is poor given Le Central's focus.", "author": "Patricia P."}

(Service 3/5, Food 4/5, and Ambiance 2.5/5) and I came here for dinner Saturday at 8pm for Restaurant Week.  I picked this restaurant over the others because the prix fixe menu actually offered their signature dishes at a good deal, which is not the case for all restaurants that participate. I'm not sure why the reviews are so bad on service. We came 15 minutes before our reservation, and was seated right away. We actually weren't too fond of the spot, and the hostess was kind enough to accommodate by moving us to another table. Our server was also very sweet. He tended to us, but not in an annoying way. I took some points off because he kept mixing up our dishes as he served them and only gave one of us water, when we both had asked. The comments regarding how dated the restaurant is are pretty accurate. It's not terrible, but the old lighting fixtures and dated surroundings make you think what the kitchen is like. I'm sure it needs a general face lift.\n\nFood was good.  We got the following:\nEscargot--very tender and seasoned well. perhaps a little salty, but great for dipping bread\nFrench onion soup--I honestly don't know what good French onion soup is supposed to taste like, but just know...they use a very pungent cheese on the top, so if the smell hits you when you walk in the door...that's what it is.\nDuck cassoulet--stand out dish in my opinion. Flavorful and rich. For those of you who don't know a cassoulet is like French white bean chili with poultry and something fatty like sausage or porcetta \nBeef bourguignon--didn't try, by my dining companion said it was very good, and cleaned his plate!\nDessert: Souffle glace & chocolate mousse both excellent ways to finish off the meal. One refreshing and light and the other rich and creamy.\n\nOverall I'd say try Le Central for a taste of French food.

Excellent food, warm and welcoming service puts this restaurant at one of my favorites in the city.  I love the old school vibe and the traditional dishes. It's perfect on a classic SF foggy day. If you're new to the area, step off the main drag and enjoy some really authentic old school SF dining. Many of the French spots nearby are a little touristy, and not as great of service. Have been there about 8 times - for dinner and for cocktails at the bar, and it's always great. \n\nThe dinner is a little pricey, but worth it for quality food. The happy hour, however, is a great deal. Tip: go to happy hour early, and catch some of their great happy hour drinks and food at the bar.", "author": "Hyly K."}

The food is fantastic and it won't break your wallet. I used to work off of New Montgomery, and this was a favorite spot for all of our Executives.

If you're not sure what you want to drink, just give them an idea and they'll make something to match whatever you're craving.\n\nThe space here is limited, as with most SF spots, so try to make reservations, or be prepared for a small wait on weekends.

We came here for my best friends birthday dinner. My partner was not feeling well and needed to go to the bathroom. I went with him to make sure he was ok. Another friend also came back a little bit after to check on him, he was fine, just sick. The bartender then took it upon himself to come back to the bathroom and very publicly yell, for the entire restaurant to hear, \"What's going on? Are you two ok in there?\". My friends also overheard the bartender making snide remarks about the two of us. He implied the two of us were doing something in the bathroom together. I am appalled that a restaurant would employ such a despicable human being that would treat its customers so poorly. He continued to laugh loudly about the situation. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone. The restaurant manager seemed to approve of this behavior as all she offered to do to rectify the situation was to give us her business card and to join them at a later date. We immediately asked for our bill so we could leave. Upon paying the tab and leaving, we observed the restaurant manager and another employee eating the dinner we had ordered. It's a very unfortunate thing as the appetizers we had tasted were great but their employees ruined it.

I highly recommend those!\n\nWe both had Petrale sole in a lemon butter sauce with boiled potato, carrot, and broccoli on the side.  It was perfectly cooked with an egg wash and then saut\u00e9ed.  At least that's how I tasted it.  There were two portions of sole so my husband and I could've easily shared this dish.  We did split a butter lettuce salad to start and that is always good with a light creamy vinaigrette dressing and a small amount of chopped egg on top.\n\nWe had excellent black coffee and skipped dessert.

That may have been but I am sorry, it can't be the French way to make it taste terrible.  Too much dressing on the rest of the dish.  The crab cake is OK but way too dry, making me think they took it out of the fridge and microwave it.  The only saving grace is that my friend's scallop dish is done properly, seared lightly.

It's all about traditional, heavy country style French cuisine. (Not the modern light fair.) It's frequented by old money personalities dressed to impress. I'm told Willie Brown has a permanent table at the entrance of the restaurant. \n\nWe made last minute dinner reservations through OpenTable in honor of Bastille Day. The moment I walked in from the streets of downtown San Francisco, I was transformed to Aix en Provence, France. Once we arrived, they greeted us and seated us immediately. Everyone was dressed in French berets and patriotic neckties. The two small dining rooms and bar area were serenaded by a talented accordion player with traditional French tunes. At times, the musician would hum along with his music and customers hummed or sang along as well.\n\nThis is a small restaurant with lots of tables close to each other so we made new friends with revelers on both sides of us. Every time someone got up, the servers were right there to shift the table to help you in and out. It felt just like a packed family dinner table. The entire dining room felt like someone's home. Great service throughout our dinner. \n\nInstead of the regular dinner menu, a special Bastille Day menu was offered. It included several of their popular dishes. We couldn't resist the aromas coming from the kitchen.\n\nAppetizers:\nFrench Onion Soup - hmmm....skip next time.\nEscargots - Great!\n\nEntree:\nCassoulet - Delicious!  (if you've never had it, it has white beans, sausage and duck served in a little iron pot cassoulet.)\nBeef Bourguignon - Flavorful!\n\nDessert:\nLemon Souffle - Light and tart! Absolute must order!\n\nA wonderful neighborhood gem right down the street from the French Consulate. It's a must visit if you live in SF or just visiting. It's a small and very popular restaurant so reservations are highly recommended.", "author": "Christine T."}

I wish I had checked Yelp prior to eating there because I notice that they have 3.5 stars, and after my experience I find that many stars to be very generous. We were 3 for dinner. Entered the restaurant and were seated immediately because it's wednesday and not too many people were out having dinner. After being seated one of my friends went to the bathroom. In that time the remaining diners ordered cocktails. When my friend returned from the restroom he ordered the same drink I had, a dirty martini. My drink came within moments of the second martini being ordered, but sadly his never arrived. After 10 minutes my friend asked the waiter, who finally acknowledged us, that the drink had never arrived. We could see the server asking the bartender only to learn that the server was not the only one to forget the beverage, but the bartender did as well. At that point my fellow diner told the sever to forget the drink. What was the point since it looked like it would take forever. I guess if we had followed a another tables approach and gotten up from our seats to inform the waiter of the need for a beverage we would have received our order.\n\nFood. Well after the drink incident we decided to cut our orders short. No starters, just 1 dish per person plus a side of fries. I ordered the lamb chops medium rare. It was an extravagant dish and quite costly, but it was a special occasion. When they arrived I started to cut into dry overcooked meat. Instead of the juicy medium rare they were more medium to medium well. Not a good sign. Lamb is not a forgiving protein. I took a couple of bites, but realized that majority of the meat was tough and not worth the effort to chew. Upon realizing this the server offered to get me something else, but considering what my fellow diners were eating I didn't want to hold up the group by waiting another 15-20 minutes for a new entree. \n\nWhen the check arrived I thought to myself this is absolutely ridiculous to pay $60.36 for a meal that was neither enjoyable nor filling. I hope the servers and kitchen staff appreciated eating all the meat that was left on my plate. I should not have to pay for the staff meal and definitely learned my lesson. San Francisco restaurants can care less about their diners. They just think we're going to go quietly after bad service and terrible food. I hope others see this review and think twice before wasting their time and money.\n\nSpend a little extra to teach your staff proper techniques for the dining room as well as the execution of your menu.", "author": "S P."}

We were seated parallel to the bar. to sit down you have to pull the table out so that there is room to squeeze by and also when you have to get out to go to the bathroom it was a big hassle. also i sat on the outside not against the wall and my chair was being hit all the time and that was with no one sitting at the bar stool behind me i can only imagine what it would be like if someone was sitting behind me at the bar.

From the host/owner(?)/manager(?), to the waiter, to the bus boy to the cook!!!, they were all Chinese!  The service I received was also comparable to a dimsum experience -- harried.  They spoke Chinese too! (IN A FRENCH RESTAURANT!!!???)\n\nI ordered the French Onion Soup - which was bland and very ordinary ($9)\n\nFor entree, I had the Sea Bass special of the day - supposedly fillet -- but had 4 big bones ($28).  This too was very ordinary, bland and dry.\n\nLemon Souffle for dessert that didn't do anything for me ($11).  This is comparable to something you can order from Denny's.\n\nDiet coke was served in a 6 inch tall, very narrow glass, full of ice.  I probably had 2 good, long sips from my straw...and like magic, it was all gone. ($3.50)  I asked for a refill and I don't know what I was thinking.  I guess I expected a bottomless drink.  Until I got my bill and I got charged $7 for my Diet Coke.  I asked tthe waitress if this was perhaps a mistake and she said it wasn't a mistake.  I told her I only got 2 good sips from the first glass because it was basically 80% ice.  But she just shrugged and said \"oh  no, that's the way we do it.\".\n\nOne of the reviews commented on the staff brown-nosing the host/owner/manager; SO TRUE!!!  The staff not once failed to whisper something to host/owner/manager everytime they passed him.  \n\nThe place was also filthy.  It didn't help that I sat right in front of the kitchen.\n\n1 and 2 star reviews are so so true.  This place is a BIG TIME WANNABE.\n\nProbably once upon a time this place was a must-go.

We were seated right away because we had a reservation (general tip:  whenever you can, make a reservation, it will make dinning out a lot easier).  \n\nThe tables are veryyy close together (in fact, the waiter had to pull the table out for me to get to my seat.  Also it did get pretty loud during dinner, but not unbearable and understandable considering the place was packed.  It was pretty busy so we were served by just random waiters which made it a bit confusing when it came to asking for the bill at the end.\n\nAs for food, we had the crab cake for our appetizer and my bf really liked it but I found it a bit too \"carb-y\"?  Later he had the half chicken and said it was pretty good and I had the grilled salmon.  OMG.  Best salmon ever.  Not fishy, buttery, and soft and the sauce was amazing too.  \n\nAs for the price, I think it was a BIT overpriced for what it was, but then again it is a slightly fancier place.

The main course was roast chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes - this is a classic and they did a great job; I usually don't like chicken but this was delish, I could not stop eating. Finally, the chocolate mousse for dessert was solid, but its hard to screw that up. \n\nOverall this place was not an amazing food find, but I think its a solid neighborhood french spot. The one complaint I have is that the wine was horrible - first I asked the waiter for a recommendation, and it was a step above 2-buck-chuck quality.

It was a relaxed atmosphere and just felt comfortable.  If you go, try to get the table for four near the window.  It's fun to look out at the street or be near the open window on a warm evening (like we were).\n\nI loved some of the little touches, like bringing the specials of the day on a board that they propped up on a tiny easel so we could all see it.  We also liked the way they served our martinis, too.  They served them in small martini glasses with only part of the martini in the glass.  The remainder came tiny little carafes sitting on ice in small buckets to keep them cold.  So cool.\n\nOnto the food!  The menu is classic French bistro food and we enjoyed everything that we had.  We decided to start with three appetizers and rotate them between the three of us:  beet salad (I'm a huge fan of beets and there were a ton of them), asparagus vinaigrette (special of the day), and prosciutto with cantaloupe.  All were light and nice starts to the meal.\n\nFor entrees we all chose something different.  I usually don't order chicken at restaurants, but for some reason it was calling out to me and I had the roast chicken with fries.  It was so moist and had lots of flavor.  My other friends chose the cassoulet and the halibut special and enjoyed both of them.  \n\nThe waitress was stretched thin as she was the only waitstaff there that night (not sure why because it was a Saturday night...maybe someone was sick), but I thought she did a great job.

We were welcomed, seated and given menus.  Lynn arrived at 12:30.  We had almost decided what we were going to have when the waitress realized we had not been shown the specials board.  She did and when Nina and I saw chicken livers that blew away anything else we had thought to order.  Lynn stuck w/ the roasted half chicken and fr\u00eetes she had decided on.  We were given a basket w/ sliced baguette and butter.  Lynn and I each had a glass of Vouvray, which was bit sweeter than either of us had expected, but was tasty and not too sweet.\n\nThe chicken livers, which were cooked w/ Calvados and cream and served over pasta, were easily among the best we have had.  Every bite was a pleasure.  Lynn's chicken and fr\u00eetes were accompanied by sauteed spinach.  The portion was generous enough that she took some home.  We finished off w/ coffee and tea.  Service was smooth, attentive and unobtrusive and the restaurant was gloriously old school w/ dark woods, wooden floors, tables and booths.  A large wood bar fills one side of the room where you enter.  There is a single bathroom for women and one for men.

The fresh flowers on the table were lovely.\n\nThe service was ok. Our server did not offer any descriptions of the specials. In fact, no specials were mentioned, but a little chalk board was hung on the wall near us so we could read them for ourselves. After our order was placed, the chalk board was taken away. I noticed an insect on the sleeve of our waiter, mentioned it to him, and he was very appreciative of my notification.\n\nThe food was ok. We ordered the endive salad, cassoulet, and the Apple Tarte Tatin. The endive salad did have a nice dressing. The cassoulet was served in a very cute, Le Cruset mini-cocotte. The Tarte Tatin, was not sweet and bits of the apple core were in the apples. It kind of had a strange flavor, as I expected some apple taste and maybe a hint of caramel, but it didn't taste like that at all.

We had eaten here about 7-8 years ago and thought it was okay, but not worth the hype. We tried it again last night and came to the same conclusion: okay, but nothing remarkable. \n\nThe food was actually very good (French onion soup and their \"legendary\" cassoulet for me and roasted chicken for my wife). Rather than listing the winery for each wine that they sold by-the-glass, the wine list showed only the varietal (pinot noir, merlot, etc.)...but not the name of the winery who produced it. So unless you asked, you had no idea whether you were getting 2-Buck-Chuck or something far better.\n\nThe servers and hosts were all very nice, but lacked the finesse and care that you'd expect. There wasn't a lot of down-time between courses -- it felt a little rushed. It was service with a smile -- nothing more, nothing less. Pretty much \"I'm here to take your order and bring you your food.\" \n\nMoreover, one of the owners (or by all the fuss, we assumed he was the owner) was dining that night near where we sat and during the early part of our meal, he kept pacing throughout the dining room and was talking on his cell phone as he determinedly strode back and forth between the kitchen, his table and the hostess desk. \n\nOnce his wife arrived, a continuous stream of brown-nosers from the wait staff loitered by his table in the corner, which was just a few tables from where we were sitting. It made for a rather uncomfortable dining experience, as we felt a bit like interlopers rather than welcomed guests.\n\nSo I'd give the food 3-4 stars (nothing to complain about, but not remarkable enough for the food alone to bring me back again). I'd give the service 2+ stars...\"serviceable\" or \"pedestrian\" are words that come to mind.\n\nIf you're looking for a decent meal and not a memorable dining experience, it's fine.

But, unfortunately it falls way short of what it could be.  My husband and I stopped by for dinner recently and ordered two glasses of Bordeaux, the chicken dinner, and goat cheese/leek tart.  The wine tasted cheap and was undrinkable, and we had to send it back.  Dinner arrived much too quickly and was luke warm and totally boring and bland.  The 1/2 chicken plate was dominated by french fries (and I'd be surprised if that was actually 1/2 chicken). And the pear served with the tart was right out of a can. \n\nTo the owner of Le Central - there are plenty of people who would embrace the old school french bistro. Update quality of your food, your wine and maybe hire a french server or two and you may just have a winner.", "author": "Sharon R."}

The ambiance was cute, although the lighting seemed strangely institutional - that bright yet dim lighting of public school, if you know what I mean. Our waiter was grumpy but attentive. There is, however, a strange smell to the place that I notice has been commented on in other reviews.\n\n- Onion soup: OK but very oily (yes, more oily than this dish usually is). Surprised to see so much love for this in other reviews - maybe it was an off night for the onion soup?\n- Cassoulet: truly delicious, but I could only eat 1/4 of the dish before I started to feel ill. I'm a big eater, but this dish was just far too rich for me - and with the oily appetizer, it was just overwhelming. I highly recommend sharing this and starting with a salad instead!\n- Creme Brulee: I had a few delicious bites but felt too sick from the rest of the meal to eat much. Too bad, since it was very good. \n-Bread: I expect really delicious bread at a French bistro, and this was very mediocre.\n\nOverall, not a bad experience, but we probably would have felt disappointed about the food had we not been paying the discounted DAT prix fixe.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-26", "description": "Le Central is a very lovely restaurant with a fun ambiance and d\u00e9cor and which serves mostly tasty food. Only a few missteps prevent it from being great but it is solid and pleasant.\n\nThe first thing that Le Central has going for them is the design of the interior. Very lovely decorations and set-up with a mock-up of a French cafe in half of the restaurant and a more traditional dining room on the other side. Fun old-style posters, nice mirrors and booths, wooden beams, stained-glass decorations ... All of it is very lovely to look at and definitely gives it a French look without going overboard in the clich\u00e9 department.\n\nThe service is friendly and our waiter was actually French which was a nice touch. I will say that we arrived early and as the evening wore on and the restaurant started to fill out, he was clearly overworked and we have to wait a LONG time for our dessert and bill. But the overall service was fine.\n\nNow on to the food. My major critique of the menu is simple: if this is a French restaurant, then the menu should be less generic. There are handful of specifically French items on the menu - and, as we will see, they taste great - and most of what is on the menu did sound yummy to me regardless but I did go there for French food and it turned out very little was \"typically French\". \n\nWe started off with onion soup, escargots and crabcakes. The onion soup - which I didn't taste because it is not my favorite - was disappointingly bland according to my dinner companion. Not bad per se but bland and a bit sweet. The cheese crust was wonderful though and it was served in a beautiful little pot which is a nice touch. \nThe two other appetizers were great. The escargots were exactly as they should be - although served out of the shell which is a shame since digging them out is half the fun. The garlic sauce was delicious and they were cooked perfectly. Soft without a hint of chewiness which is wonderful. Not out of this world because to this French eater, well, that's a common French dish but very very good. \nThe crabcakes on the other hand were absolutely to die for. Perfectly cooked - moist inside, crispy without being hard on the outside. The taste was crabby without being overwhelming with a nice touch of red pepper and the butter sauce was divine. We scooped it up with bread for sure!\nTalking about the bread, I was a bit surprised at how unremarkable it was. It was not bad per se but definitely needed to be better-quality at a French restaurant (crispier on the outside for a start).\n\nThe entrees were very very good. The cassoulet, first and foremost, is what this place is known for and now I see why. It was just Heaven. Both because it was authentic and \"as it should be\" and because it tasted unbelievable on its own right. Soft and melting in the mouth without being mushy. The wonderful meats all combined together for such a luscious experience. Absolutely recommended.\nAs for those Yelpers who complain the \"Casoulet\" was too rich, my question is: did they even know what a cassoulet is? That is the way it is SUPPOSED to be. Don't knock a restaurant for making the dish exactly like it should be cooked. They are welcome to dislike cassoulet but it is their mistake for ordering it, not to the restaurant for cooking it to perfection. I ate it all and was still hungry for dessert. Yeah, it is rich but appropriately so.\nThe lamb was also cooked perfectly with a lovely subtle wine sauce and the accompaniments were tip-top awesome. Creamy and delicate scalloped potatoes, sauteed spinach and a very nice - if a bit spicy to my taste - ratatouille.\nI also had some Roquefort just because. \n\nThe only disappointment was dessert. That creme brulee was a big miss as far I am concerned. The texture was very very wrong. Sickeningly firmer than it should be (it should melt in the mouth, not feel like Jello) and you could tell right away it was off because the sugar top did not crack as it should when we put our spoons to it.\n\nIn the end, this was a very very enjoyable meal with, as it should be, as highlight two wonderful entrees. It had enough small disappointments that it does not deserve five stars but it is a solid four stars. We definitely had trouble digesting afterward so maybe you should order more strategically and eat lighter but it was a wonderful dinner.", "author": "Dorian S."}

I looked through the menu for a short period of time before deciding on the crab cakes for my first course. The presentation was phenomenal. I just wish the flavours were equally as stunning. The burr blanc was kind of mediocre, though I must admit the crab cake was very meaty and a good portion of crab. Everything just seemed slightly under-seasoned. Things picked up with the second course. The Beef Bourguignon was a perfect marriage of tender beef and red wine. The carrots were soft yet not overdone and it was a very comforting dish for the slighty chilly northern California evening. Things continued to get better with the creme brulee. I'm not much for sweets but this one was done perfectly. I'm usually sort of unimpressed by creme brulee, by this one was perfectly creamy and not overpowering with sweetness.

He's a terrific man, polite and interesting. We only addressed him as we were leaving and simply said how nice it was to see him.  We visit here often and never miss this place. The specials are winners and my last was steak tartar while my wife had the leek tart and we added salads and the pomme frites. This time I had a rum and coke and my wife had a house recommended white which was out of this world. In the past we had sat in the dinning room, at the bar, but this time at a table on the bar side. It is now where we will prefer to sit from now on. One thing that's special here is the attention to detail and the standard house dishes, one of which is cassoulet. Its the best we have ever had including visits to France. Amazingly, they had a hamburger on the menu this last time. I was tempted but then thought where would I have some of the other dises if I had this. Not to be missed is the Escargot and the French Onion Soup ... tho we don't often finish all the dishes we order we like to taste them. Finally, the classic French roast chicken. Wonderful.

After having lunch at Cafe de la Presse I wanted to have lunch at Le Central. I did some research on their menu. I was interested in the cassoulet as it had the Le Central namesake on the dish. For any restaurant if it has their namesake restaurant on their dish it usually means it is one of their specialties. This past Thursday I went to Le Central to initially have the cassoulet only as I never had it before. The mistake was also ordering their french onion soup. The first time I had french onion soup was at Kincaid's Restaurant in Burlingame. It was really good because I liked the thick cheese on top. I hoped Le Central's would be as good. It was ok, but the disappointment was that the french onion soup and cassoulet were the same size. My fault as I should have asked the waiter how big was the cassoulet in comparison to the french onion soup. Also I should have stuck to my intention and just ordered the cassoulet only as a main dish and would have saved about $9. The cassoulet was really good but I did expect it to be in a bigger dish especially due to the price. I hadn't intended to ordered the dessert. However the waiter gave me a menu and noticed the souffl\u00e9 glac\u00e9e had the Le Central namesake on the dish so I decided to try it. It was pretty good and enjoyed it more than the French onion soup. A pretty good place to have a quick lunch from work.", "author": "Gerald R."}

However, as a member of the working class, I cannot afford to take 1 1/2 hours for lunch during the week. So we compromised on a Saturday lunch in August. Mama was not able to sit next to Willie Brown, but sacrifices must be made. She LOVED her salad nicoise, I had the cream of mushroom soup and a big bowl of hot, and salty pomme fritte. The pomme fritte was the bext bowl of potato strings I've had in a long time. Way better than Citizen Cake, fo sho. We skipped the dessert but did have coffee. It took a bit of time to get our half caf/half decaf but that's because the bus person was making FRESH just for us. Friends, that's service, and the reason I completely overtipped. \n\nMom and decided to use the ladies before leaving. We asked, and the bar man pointed the way and said that if the ladies was in use, that it was okay to use the men's. and that's what we did. The men's room was very clean, and large. \n\nI will definitely go back again for lunch. I paid $50 + tip for a geat meal and outstanding service for me and my mom. \n\nLe Central is probably good for small'ish group 6 - 8 people. I've heard that it isn't a good place for children, and while I will agree with that generally for dinner or a long lunch, I witnessed well-behaved children enjoying the pomme fritte so it can be done.", "author": "Bronwyn W."}

The tender, falling apart meat with perfectly cooked white beans are explosive with home-cooked flavor; perfect for a cold winter night.

Our server was friendly and made us feel very welcome. And the crab cake was delicious, albeit lukewarm.\n\nHowever, the food in general was extremely expensive for what you get out of it. For example, we ordered a prosciutto with melon appetizer. Sounds exotic, right? Highly underwhelming. It was literally three slices of average prosciutto on top of half a cantaloupe not even sliced well.\n\nThen there was the $16 cheese platter, which was five small pieces of cheese and a few grapes presented on a depressingly bare plate. The brie was rancid, and I'm not using the word in a slang insult way. It was literally rotten cheese gone bad. Not wanting to be rude, we asked the waiter what kind of brie it was - after all, we weren't cheese connoisseurs and maybe there is brie out there that's supposed to taste weird...? The server went to the kitchen to ask, came back with red cheeks, and said in his best waiter voice, \"Why yes, it is double ripened President brie, accent on the E\". \n\nAs in President cheese, the generic, mass-produced cheese you can get in bulk at Costco?? \n\nSo to summarize, the chef phoned in his performance and we paid $16 for rancid Costco cheese. Our total bill was more than the food was worth, and we left feeling like we'd been lied to.\n\nLater that night, we went to get drinks and dessert at Absinthe. Now THAT is a restaurant that's worth the money. Le Central could take some pointers from them.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

But as my Parisian husband put it, the rude service really made him feel like he was back home.\n\nAs my husband is from Paris, we frequent french restaurants, and we had seen Le Central on many a list of good french restaurants in the city. We were in the area last night (a thursday night) and got a table around 9pm. There were 2 other parties in the restaurant. We ordered: Duck Rillette (was nothing special; could buy higher quality at our local deli; I don't think they make it in house); Boudin Noir (too much cartilage, which I couldn't chew and left on a pile in my plate; one of the sausages was burnt); Steak Tartar (okay, but the toasted bread was burnt. We felt it was waaay overpriced at $29); With most of our food still on the plate, its a shame that nobody ever asked if something was wrong? Especially when there was a pile of cartilage on one plate.\n\nI understand that we were one of the last tables of the night, but with servers chewing on something (gum? food?) and loudly shutting down starting at 9:30pm, it just was not an enjoyable evening. We called over our waiter and gave him our card, and left as quickly as possible. As we headed home we kept scratching our heads about what could of been going on, because we had heard such good things about this restaurant.

The bar was full and only a few tables free but I did not feel crowded as some reviewers have mentioned.  In fact, this is just like restaurants on Ile St-Louis where I stayed and added to the authenticity.\n\nThe food was amazing.  We started with escargot, duck rillettes, and herb crusted goat cheese.  Followed it with the cassoulet (over 13,000 days old and still going strong!), rack of lamb, and Dayboat Scallops Proven\u00e7ale.  Everything was flavored perfectly and not a bit was left at the end of our meal.  The serving sizes were very generous, and even though we were stuffed we had to try the creme brulee and we were so glad we did.\n\nServers were great.  Fast, efficient, attentive and generous with the wine pouring.   Also, you can tell that regulars come to this place time and time again.

Not that I'm holding a grudge or anything.  \n\nOkay - back to my crab cake:  it's refreshingly free of fillers and chunks of not-crab.  It is perfect with a swipe of the beurre blanc and should be consumed reverently, at a leisurely pace.  \n\nSo... maybe this place is a bit stodgy... but between the authentic bistro fare, which includes seasonal delicacies and a charcuterie selection that never leaves me wanting...

AVOID THE CASSOULET if you insist on going here. It's a pot full of dry white beans and few pieces of leftover chicken and two slices of sausage that cost $18.50.

Too many eggs, and too soft. It barely felt like creme brulee. It was like sugar omelette.\n\nI don't like to write poor reviews on any place here on Yelp. However, for a restaurant that has been around as long as Le Central, I am compelled to be honest right here and let people know that if you want dry food and bad service Le Central might be right for you.", "author": "Matthew S."}

Truly good food. Very experienced staff who know how to take care of you provided you do not walk in wearing torn jeans with your shirt hanging out, and then demand that they change what you want to order in 10 different ways. Vegetarians need not apply. Excellent bartender and good wine list, and the wine by the glass is often a treat. Excellent steak au poivre, roast chicken, cold salmon, and the pomme frites are the best this side of Paris. Always a good dessert tray if the sweet thing is your thing. Good people watching.\n\nMy only minor complaint after eating here regularly for years is that the early lunch and dinner food can sometimes be undercooked - almost like the kitchen staff is not up and running in time for the opening hour - hence 4 stars instead of 5. A suggestion is to eat lunch after 12:30 and dinner after 6:00.

Parking was easy, managed to snag a spot right across the street. The decor/ambiance was ok; if I had to describe it all in one word, \"musty\" comes to mind. I tried the herb crusted goat cheese salad with walnuts, the beef Bourguignon, and the berry tart with Creme fraiche for dessert. I also tried a bit of M's cassoulet, a white bean stew with slow cooked lamb and duck. The salad was so so, not well presented and the goat cheese came in one big block. The entrees tasted like standard French comfort food; I half expected the theme song from ratatouille to start playing in the background. I could only finish half of my beef as it was very filling. I think the cassoulet is better than the beef because the meat is more tender and the white bean stew is quite savory.

I was reminded of it when I saw it mentioned a couple of times in Willie Brown's column - apparently it is one of his favorites too.\n\nTo make a long story short, the wife and I went there last night.  This restaurant has nothing in common with the Le Central I once knew.  I expected, but did not get, an authentic French Brasserie meal.  Not even close.\n\nThe duck rillettes, a slice of pate cut into two pieces ($11) was OK, but Marcel & Henri's is significantly better.  The saucisson chaud ($10.50)had a nice sauce, but the sausage was not house made and the waitress had not a clue where it came from.\n\nThe onion soup ($9.00) was OK, but not the killer I expected and it was quite small.  My wife ordered a shrimp salad.  It cost more than $20 and consisted of nothing but a pile of chopped head lettuce with a few small shrimp on top with a slice of tomato that was so mushy it was inedible.  The waitress told us that the chef made it larger than usual.  I gather that \"larger\" means a lot of head lettuce.\n\nThe wine list was overpriced.  we had a bottle of vin ordinaire Macon Village for $32.  I bought some of it recently for $6 retail, so the markup was over 500% - not cool to say the least.\n\nThe place wasn't crowded and one waitress was assigned to cover our entire room.  Although the poor gal ran her a-s off, she was not able to keep up.  The maitre de just stood around watching - I couldn't believe that she didn't pitch in to help.\n\nIn summary, if you want to blow $100+ on lousy food and iffy service, this is the place for you.", "author": "Michael B."}

What I do find obnoxious they can't do much about: the restaurant on the bar side is narrow, and when you're seated with your back to the restaurant, the patrons and waiters constantly hit the back of your chair trying to pass.  It gets old.  If this place were bigger, less touristy, healthier and cheaper I'd go there more often...but then it wouldn't be le Central, and I probably wouldn't like it as much.", "author": "Phil K."}

At lunch you will typically see some of San Francisco's biggest bigwig's from Mayor Willie Brown, Wilkes Bashford, even the Gov.

I would usually get the Filet Mignon with the Pepper Corn sauce and use that as dipping sauce for the fries, it is delicious.  Their Greek salad with Chicken is great for lunch. Actually all of their salads are great.  Their Shrimp Risotto was another alternative of mine.  It was always seasoned great and the risotto was great.  Their French Onion soup is always good any time of the year.  For dessert, I typically would get the tiramisu (which is still the best tiramisu, I have tasted ... and trust me I've had a lot of tiramisu).\n\nTheir servers and wait staff is very friendly and helpful.  The atmosphere is great.  It is a small bistro w/ nice dcor and usually has fresh flowers in both rooms, the bar side and the dining table side.

The food is fine -- nothing memorable -- but my overall experience was subpar. In fact, two stars is being a touch generous in my book. For lunch, at least. My boyfriend and I went in for lunch on a whim and were a bit surprised by how pricey their lunch menu was (they don't have a lunch-specific menu; it serves as a dinner menu, too). After a slight jaw drop at the $25+ lunch options, I finally settled on something small and my  boyfriend nabbed a Nicoise salad (around $20). Now, with the pricing and the intimate (read: tight) layout, I would think that the service would be top-notch to match. Nope. Not even close. I've experienced better service at Vietnamese restaurants where my server and I weren't even speaking the same language. Our server was far from welcoming and at times I felt like we were a burden for him. He was very blunt when answering my questions and seemed extremely perturbed by the fact that I ordered off of the starter menu for me meal. I mean, KILL ME! I wanted soup -- I'm sorry I didn't get the $25 catch of the day at 1PM! As soon as I ordered, his response went directly to the order minimum (apparently there's a $15 minimum per person... oops on my part for not reading the fine print): 'Well, I guess I'll let the minimum go since you're obviously not hungry.' Umm... okay, gee, thanks. While I do appreciate the gesture -- I really do! -- I felt bad the entire time and felt like a complete cheap ass for being called out. The waiter  plus the stuffy environment made our lunch very awkward. I would have opted for hole-in-the-wall pho or cheap-o sandwiches over this place.

The review was over 2 years old, and I guess have changed.  I ate there about a week before Christmas with a group of 9.  I had made the reservation, which was easy enough to make for a Wednesday night.  Immediately my impression was of a tired, old restaurant trying to hang out to its glory days.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and attentive.  I ordered a nightly special, pasta Bolognese.  I've had much better in Italian restaurants.  It was quite bland.  I should have ordered the cassoulet, their specialty.  Two others did, and I got to try it.  It was excellent.  It tasted like it had been cooking for hours, and it just melted in my mouth.\n\nSomeone had a fish dish, and they said it was pretty unremarkable.  To compare, I had eaten the year before at Caf\u00e9 Claude, a couple of doors down.  That place definitely made me feel like I was in a French bistro.  The food at Le Central was several notches below that.\n\nFor a place on the coast I've never understood why the prices are so high on seafood -- and everything else for that matter.  I can get food that is far superior here at home, including seafood, for much lower prices.  I understand that cost of doing business is higher there, but still...\n\nI'd recommend this place for a group, but for a more intimate dining experience and better food I'd go elsewhere.", "author": "Philip G."}

At $25 if it had been a proper risotto then I would have been, okay there was some work involved in the dish and perhaps justification of the cost of the entree, but it was plain old rice, and grilled prawns, no special talent needed to do this.. So basically it was like $5 a prawn and $5 for a portion of rice.. I know you are close to Union Square and get a lot of tourists (BTW, I am not a tourist, I might have an accent but I've lived here for 22 years). Set the expectations for the diner. I was expecting risotto, I got rice with peas. The Butter lettuce salad was good, true to the menu. Desert was good too, and true to the menu.

It's very french - meaning the crusted mahi mahi that i ordered came laden with a rich, heavy cream sauce and accompanied with creamed spinach.

Sit on the bar side  if you can.  I typically come here in the late afternoons when the crowds thin out (don't care about the who's who who eat here and wouldn't recognize them anyhow).  Over the last several years it seemed like the service and food was going downhill but recently had a great lunch.  Cold salmon and the salad nicoise (?sp) were very good.  Service was good.  Would have given it 3 stars but since it seemed to be improving I bumped it to 4 and will obviously return.  someone else mentioned possible new owners, I don't know about that but something seemed different and potentially for the better.", "author": "Damon S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-03-26", "description": "I give this restaurant three stars for one reason only: the food was pretty damn good.  The service on the other hand was awful.  Our waitress took about 15 minutes to come to the table (the busboy had already given us bread, but we didn't have anything to drink), and was as personable as wet cardboard.  She didn't ask if we had questions or make any suggestions as to what we should order as first time diners.  The appetizer arrived and instead of the french onion soup I ordered I was presented with a crab cake.  I alerted her to the error and decided just to eat the crab cake, which was delicious, instead of wait for her to remedy the situation.  She apologized but once again the lack of any real concern showed through.  My boyfriend ordered the cheese plate which was tasty but the neighboring table had to supply him with a piece of bread as our waitress never came back to check on us, although he attempted to make eye contact with her repeatedly.  It was as though she was blatantly ignoring us!  Our filet mignons with veggies were cooked properly and very good.  I had a coke to drink and after it sat empty for 10 minutes my boyfriend was finally able to flag the waitress down to ask for another.  I work in a fine dining restaurant in another state and I completely understand how it feels to be weeded, but a smile and genuine concern for my customers always goes a long way.  The tip, needless to say, was the worst I've ever given any server in the last 15 years.", "author": "Meg D."}

For the price, try Absinthe on Hayes.\n\nThe food was just okay.  Nothing to write home about.  I had the onion soup, caprese salad, and filet mignon - the soup lacked flavor, the tomatoes tasted like safeway, steam-ripened delights and it felt like the kitchen was trying to hide the fact that the ingredients were cheap by burying them in mediocre salad dressing.  The filet was nothing special.  The presentation was laughable - it felt like Joe's at Westlake.\n\nGenerally an older crowd.   The tables are crowded together, so you're literally sitting inches away from the people next to you.  On the night we went out, my wife and I were enjoying ourselves and our own conversation, but by the end of the night, we found ourselves having to apologize to the people next to us - a pretentious, older (50+), racist (anti-german) french couple sitting next to us - because they thought we were being too loud and gesturing too flamboyantly.\n\nGiven the crowded placement of the tables, the mediocre food, and buzz killing neighbors we had the night we were there - I have to give this place 2-stars....", "author": "Justin V."}

I've gone here three times, with my best friend and her parents, before a show at the GG Theater. (Years ago, right?) Personally, I've NEVER had a bad experience here, and the food I've ordered has been very good. The service is hilarious if you don't take the waiters seriously! I never do. When we were there last we saw Maggie Scura. Cracked me up! She looked exactly like she did on TV years ago! We've seen the mayor W. Brown, too. I don't know. It's an old SF institution... I dig it for the experience, and honestly, I've always had good food or I wouldn't come back. You just have to know what to order. (Not the rabbit, apparently...) I wish I could remember what I enjoyed the most, but other than the creme brulee, I'm drawing a blank. I've eaten at too many French restaurants to keep the menus straight unless I've just eaten there.

Salad a little over dressed but then again its not Bosnia. Wine list is a bit varied but from a consistency standpoint - Le Central is always there for a good dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-02-13", "description": "Our recent visit was truly a bad dining experience. I think that the quality has plummetted, perhaps its 'new ownership,' not the original team. We were a group of 4 sitting in the back room. On the banquette at a table next to us was a man and woman 'couple' who were amorous in an appallingly inappropriate plublic manner. Our group is in our 40's and no prudes, but it was an uncomfortable experience, one that we felt discomfort not only for ourselves but for those around us also who clearly had an issue with this inappropriate behavior in a public setting. It was also a disappointment that management didn't address this situation and seemed to ignore the comfort of their guests. I would never bring my parents to this place after witnessing that. On top of that, our server, and thus service, was poor: slow, forgetful, and usually absent. The food was forgettable, I had casoulet, which was just mediocre, lacking in flavor, I have had much much better elsewhere (eg., Jeanty at Jacks). I would be disinclined to suggest Le Central to my parents - or my friends - in the future- but i would suggest they go to any of the better french restaraunts in town, Jeanty's, Cafe Claude, Fringale, etc..", "author": "Mike P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-02-01", "description": "On 1/26/10 a friend and I had dinner here and I must agree with some of the other reviews that the place is not worth the money for the quality of the menu items. My filet with the peppercorn sauce was just OK but the sauce drowned out the flavor of the meat. The onion soup was very tasty however and normally I would give more stars but the attitude of the waiter controls the number of stars in this case. The place was virtually empty and yet the service was very poor with the waiter having an attitude of boredom as if he was  bothered having to wait on us. I had read they were participating in the \" dine about town' pre fixed dinner plan and yet when I asked about this they were somewhat aloof and not eager to provide any information about this program.When we did get that ' dine about town ' menu he started to grab our regular menus away with a huffy attitude. Although we did not select that pre fixed menu it would have been the smarter thing to do since the value for the regular ala carte entrees was just not there. Maybe if the wait staff's attitude was a bit more friendly they would have more than 3 tables full on a week day night !", "author": "Ann B."}
