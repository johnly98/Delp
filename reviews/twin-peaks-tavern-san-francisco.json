The bar itself is small inside but I'm sure it's because most building in the area are historic. The drinks where strong and worth every penny. You must bring cash to this bar they do not take debit or credit. There is an ATM on the property just in case your like me and never carry cash. The location is right in the center of the Castro district. It has a second floor that overlooks the bar, it small and only has 3 small table with a window that overlooks the Castro district. If you in the Are and want to drink in a room full of history this is your place if you prefer a more modern less dated space then this is not for you.

In the Gay era of dominance of the Castro in tbe 1970's through the 2000's, it was called the glass coffin since it was one of the first Gay bars in San Francisco with open, clear windows as well as being a hang out for Gay seniors.  \n\nNow in the late 2010's, it's a mixed bag of the teeming masses living in San Francisco. Part old school Irish pub in look and old school dive vibe, it also serves as a neighborhood bar. Not a destination bar. Come by to wet your whistle while tooling around the beloved Castro, home to illustrious Gay politician and photography store owner on  Castro, Harvey Milk. \n\nFull service bar with a small mezzanine overlooking the main bar. Casual & come as you are.   Watch your head when going to their all gender bathroom.  3+ Yelp stars.", "author": "Gary I."}

This is the Castro. Good luck. It's literally across the street from two public transportation light rail thingys so there's no issue getting here car and uber less.\n\nThis place is a great spot for a pint or a cocktail. It has lots of large picture windows perfect for viewing the ebb and flow of the street-along with the trolley stop, Harvey Milk Plaza is fully within view. It's a classic western bar-brass rail footrests along the long hardwood counter with full size mirrors backing the bar. Also lots of wooden tables and cushiony spots on ledges right in the windows. Those last are perfect spots for lounging. There is also a smaller section upstairs that is somewhat more intimate, should you so desire. The bar has a ten or so taps which cover just about all tastes in beer, a superior wine selection, and the bartenders are pretty handy with the cocktails for the most part. Pricing is not all that bad considering you are in one of the most expensive cities in the world. While the cocktails can run you out of cash (and this is a cash only place) with a quickness, beers shots and basic stuff like rum/whisky and coke are pleasingly wallet friendly.  \n\nThis is considered the first openly gay bar in the area, so there's a feeling for history here (the bar dates to 1935), yet you don't have to be gay to come and enjoy a drink or two (or three. Who's counting eh?) while you are out and about. Indeed if you are not comfortable with/new to the whole gay culture thing, this is a great way to wade in as opposed to jumping straight off into the deep end. Start by talking to the oldtimers at the bar. They've been around long enough to have seen (and in many cases been a part of) just about everything. \n\nWhen it's all said and done, this is an excellent local spot for a shot of mellow liquor based relaxation.", "author": "Steven W."}

Nope, not lost my Social Security gathering fellas. The place was slammed so we resorted to standing in the corner with our sub-par drinks just standing there all awkward until the nice guys next to us offered some seats at their large table.

The coffin part is probably a sarcastic reference to the age of the patrons.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-11", "description": "The Twin Peaks is the only bar you can reliably have a drink and talk with your friends late on a Sunday afternoon in the Castro.  The other watering holes have succumbed to fundraisers, drag shows, and sports... All delivered at a SUPERLOUD volume. \n\nAt Twin Peaks there's usually room at a shared table, and you can always hear your friends. I like the low-key, different-aged crowd, and I love picture windows through which you can watch the world go by. The recent nudity by the wrong people centered at Market and Castro makes some of the views less inviting -- bring back the unobstructed view of the gas station -- but the liveliness of the streets coming into the bar is a great bonus.\n\nBut... \n\n1.  If the bartenders smiled or acknowledged your presence without a flat stare, I might think they cared.  Luckily, I don't have to worry.  Typical: Sunday one bartender glanced over the people queuing up at his well, turned his back, and chatted up someone he knew at the end of the bar some more.  The other bar tender was chatty and friendlier six months ago, but apparently he was told he had too much personality and is now flat, too.\n\n2. The drinks are small and more expensive than other Castro spots.  You get a small cocktail glass when you order a mixed drink, say gin and tonic. If you order a drink without mixers over ice -- say a Manhattan -- they use a really tiny glass. The gin and tonic and the tiny Makers Mark Manhattan was $12something, if I remember correctly.  They have no happy hour or drink specials.\n\n3. Their well bourbon is nasty.\n\nI so much want to have a place I can go with my friends for a drink on Sunday, but I don't want to have to fight the Twin Peaks staff and pricing. Between 5:30 and 7 Eurkea's lounge http://www.yelp.com/biz/eureka-restaurant-and-lounge-san-francisco offers happy hour special cocktails that are better, cheaper, and served by folks with personality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-28", "description": "I've been going to the Twin Peaks since the time it was a neighborhood straight bar. It was owned by two drunk dykes who landed up in Palm Springs and eventually sold it the present owners.  I stopped in there daily and was friends with 4 of the bartenders who all died from Aids.  \n    My partner loves the Twin Peaks bar. I hate the place for many reasons. Number #1 is that I feel like I am in Gdynia Poland in a neighborhood bar near the shipyards. I expect Lech Walensa to walk in wearing a dirty bowling shirt.  The pattrons look like they are on loan from the Tenderloin Homeless Shelter.  For being gay men who know so much about opera, and Betty Davis's hometown and shoe size, they take no personal pride in themselves and are absolutely slobs.\n     Many of the patrons are not has beens, they are never was's.  Old Queens, left over drunks who now want senior gay housing and talk about this at the table. While tourists come in from all over the world, most of the regulars are just that. Irregular regulars.\nI happened to take a hot Chinese fellow in there, age 30, and we just could not get enough napkins to wipe up the drool from fellow patrons. Had their DNA shown any piranha background, my fellow would have been eaten alive. Such bad manners.\n    There are 2 restrooms. One downstairs with that putrid cookie smell coming in from next door, and the other discrete one upstairs for those who have to poop. Its just off the balcony which is like being voluntarily exiled to Siberia. Only go up there if you feel you want to relive choir practice, you are removed from the action downstairs.\n     The drinks are okay, no bottled beer now, no blender drinks. Nothing fancy, the usual alcoholic measures to get you loaded although the Chinese waitress is a kind, older woman and they don't push drinks.\n    Food:  There is nothing to eat, not even a deep fried roach. After the straight people sold the place, all the snacks were removed and you cannot get a bag of pretzels or nuts or anything for that matter, they don't want to be bothered with it. So picture this you get your drink placed on a wooden table top and that's it. Picture drinking in Gdynia and you will get the idea.  \n     There is quite a turn over in the place and often times, patrons will come in, look around, develop a look of horror, and flee. Thank God the Dutch door swings both ways. For people watching as the Muni underground regurgitates them frequently, it can't be beat. If the sun bothers you, feel free to lower the blinds. Then raise them when the sun goes over Twin Peaks.  The Twin Peaks is a gold mine for its owners. They give little in return. If you ever get a free drink there, please let me know.

Since Twin Peaks is another Castro landmark, just like the Castro Theatre and Harvey's, I decided to brave the bar and have a drink - which is a logical thing to do after seeing a film at the Castro.  Upon arriving, the place was not crowded and the bartender who's name I think was Paul was friendly and spot on with the drink.  I did not have to shove and push my way to the bar which was great.    I watched as he made the Crown and ginger, I must say it indeed was a Crown with Ginger - wow - nice! \n\nBeing from out of town, I asked if I could take a few photos of the interior and he said it was OK as long as I did not photograph any patrons faces etc..  I dashed upstairs and snapped a few quick no flash photos of the wonderful wooden bar structure which is something no longer seen in newer bars.  As I sat at the bar consuming the drink, it was evident there were many regular patrons who stop in for a drink because both bartenders knew them by name and it was not just 1 or two patrons.   \n\nI also saw the bakery which is next door and that explains the fresh baked / cookie aroma wafting thru the place as no food is served..it is liquid nutrition all the way and oh btw - cash only. \n\nOverall, Twin Peaks is nice place to have a drink and still be able to have a conversation with friends and hear yourself think. There's no blaring dive music and hip-hop to be 20 somethings who need a dose of reality.  Also, the upstairs is small but nice and certainly out of the main traffic patterns. The expansive window views to the outside have surely contributed to the \"glass coffin\" nickname.  However, while I was there there the patrons were a mix of ages and several groups of both sexes.  Being known as a mainly gay bar, I was quite surprised when 5 young ladies entered and settled in at one of the front tables. In fact, several of the couples were male / female - go figure.   \n\nOverall, this is a nice convenient locale to stop in for a great reasonably priced drink (especially after catching a film at the Castro) and not have your ears blasted off with loud music or noisy tight mobs.  If that type of environment is what you are looking for, or gay bars make you uncomfortable for whatever reason, then there are ample locations elsewhere in the city to find it.

I'm a fan of lists as they make information somewhat easier to digest in tasty little bulleted morsels:\n\n1. There is some magical voodoo chicken blood in the varnish of the beautiful wood that frames the large mirror behind the bar - in that it keeps the loud, obnoxious, standing and posing fags out out OUT.  For this I am grateful to the point of sending a check to some random address in New Orleans thanking some unnamed priestess.\n\n2. The bartenders are all extremely friendly and know me and my boyfriend by name.  I love me some Paul and Spyro!  Yet their athletic skills far outweigh their amiable nature.  I once witnessed Spyro who, in one impressive move, jumped over the bar, grabbed a drunk patron by the collar, and removed him from the bar in less than 45 seconds time.\n\n3. They have coffee.\n\n4. The place is full of gentlemen - men who know how to have a conversation that doesn't involve pretense or what I do for a living.  Sure there's a little leering, but it sure beats the playground antics of some of the other bars.\n\n5. There is a wonderful (and eventful) little roost up above with nice chairs and tables and lamps.  It was from here where I saw two men completely naked (if you don't count the Teva's and cock rings) standing on the corner out front.  Any vantage point offering observations like that will have to deal with my gin breath and garlic farts.\n\n6. Even when it is crowded and bustling, I can always count on being able to have a conversation that isn't punctuated by \"what\" \"huh\" \"pardon me\" \"let's go outside\".  I do not require the bass beats of the newest Kylie Minogue remix to compensate for the fact that I couldn't carry on a dialogue if it were stapled to my nut sack.\n\n7. Finally, there is this fantastic gentlemen with whom I am still unacquainted with a bejeweled belly button ring and booty shorts.  And he looks fan-FUCKING-tastic.  I wanna go where he goes!\n\nSo if I'm in the Castro, I will likely begin my bar crawl here so that I can at least have one positive bar experience in the evening.", "author": "Josh B."}

Definitely the place to go if you've joined AARP or you're in the market for a sugar daddy . . . or granddaddy.  The crowd tends to be friendlier than in most gay bars, because there's no emphasis on youthful looks, buff bodies, or one night stands.  Sadly, too many here have had one too many, as they mourn their empty lives to the sad sounds of the golden oldies on the juke box.  In a city with so many gay resources, how is it there's no better place for the older ones to socialize and/or do something other than drink away their days?", "author": "Gourmet G."}

He's been going for over 30 years.  Says it was opened in the 60s by lesbians who sold it to their long-time bartenders within the last 5 years to be sure that it continued on the way it's always been.  Apparently it was the first gay bar in the city (some say in the country) to have windows.  Great history.   The customers are older, but super friendly and full of stories.", "author": "P J."}

There's nothing like sitting next to the window with a strong gin and tonic, chatting with your best friend, and people watching as everyone walks by.

After all, there is no where else in the city where you can watch ancient queens age so (dis)gracefully. Going entirely ungently into their good night, the patrons here play awful tunes full of nostalgia on the juke box, and have been known to weep quietly into their triple strength Irish coffees. It's hardly surprising, because the Irish coffees are strong enough to make anyone's eyes water.", "author": "Stellah D."}

I used to join in the fun by calling this place \"The Glass Coffin\" and \"Geriatric Park\" but I came to the realization that nothing is forever....not even this generation. As I walked in I was amazed and at ease by how quiet and demure the patrons inside were. It gets exciting in here at times, but this came off to me as a place of quiet contentment and I am all about that feeling. I have a desire to go back to this place, but not on my own cause I too have can be shy and reserved when alone...and in public. This place is deserving of more exploration....it's a part of history.", "author": "James J."}

Mellow, geeky, old school, small but some cozy lounging places along the view windows facing Market and Castro and in a small upstairs.  Drinks are strong and inexpensive.  People know each other.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-01-21", "description": "I don't normally go to bars solely based on the bathroom, but I have to admit is usually part of the overall experience. But at Twin Peaks, it's without a doubt a bathroom-inspired journey. You go there, you go upstairs after getting your drink and head directly to the bathroom. Once you're in there, take a big whiff. There is a surprise that I'm not going to spoil for you by writing it here. And no it's not pee or poo, I promise. You're never going to believe the smell and it's one that I promis you, you've never ever before whiffed in a bathroom. Everything else about the bar is great too, but I'll say it again: Go to the Twin Peaks bathroom (upstairs only). It's not really a place for the ladies, but I can't say that I've ever felt unwelcome there.", "author": "Stumbalina b."}

It's actually pretty nice inside -- dark, quiet decor, reasonable space, and an upstairs.  There were pictures on the wall (real, static pictures, not the television monitors of everywhere else), and it was quiet enough to talk (again unique for the area).  Plus, maybe since we were way younger than most of the other people I saw there, all our drinks were made very strong.  We had a good time.  From force of habit (mine, and definitely my friends'), I probably won't end up back here again, but it's nice to know there's someplace in the area if you're really not in the mood for loud noise and grinding bodies.", "author": "Alex K."}
