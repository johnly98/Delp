The bartenders are wonderful people if you get to know them and the drinks are strong. You can get a red horse beer 8% abv for $5. Jukebox, pool table, 2 TV's, what more could you want. I called this place home for a long time and every time I visit town I walk into the bar unannounced and whoever is working behind the bar that night will see me, freak out, and run around the bar to give me a big hug. This place is home, I even have a tattoo of the \"high tides waves\" on my leg for all the unforgettable nights I've had here.", "author": "Dave S."}

Despite probably coming off as a bit of a nuisance we were warmly welcomed and they even didn't mind us moving some tables so that we could all sit together. We ended up ordering 4 pitchers (a bit on the expensive side for what it was) and borrowed some dice to play games. The vibes were super chill (relative to the generally uppity nature of downtown bars) and we really enjoyed being here. A couple small  down sides were the cash only policy as well as the the slightly wonky music selection; this place definitely caters to an older crowd. They also only had one pitcher available and we were made to pay for each one as we got it which was just a bit odd. Overall, though, I'd definitely come back if I was just looking for a quick drink.", "author": "Andrew P."}

One of my friends got a Jameson and ginger. The other, a Jameson and soda. The bar is divey, but the bartender was super nice and chill. We got our drinks quickly. The decor is fun and eclectic. I believe they had actual dollar bills plastered all over the walls. I noticed some foreign currency as well. Not sure what you need to do to get a bill posted, but I kind of remember there being messages written on them. So maybe you just need to tip the bartender and write a note on your bill?\n\nConvenient for a round of drinks.

Also, it's cash only.\n\nThe prices are typical, but the portions are very, very small. I wish I had taken pictures of the drinks I had two weekends ago.

My friend received what looked like the tiniest martini ever. If the drinks are so small and watered down, they can have the decency to lower the prices.\n\nThe only reason they have 2 stars instead of one is because of the fact that they were delicious and the atmosphere was quiet enough to rest after bar hopping.

And that bar is the High Tide. Usually I can find a lot of intrinsic charm and personality in these old watering holes. Not here.\n\nLet's just list out the negatives that encapsulated my experience. They are cash only. I ordered a gin and tonic but they were \"out of tonic\" with no apparent urgency to get more. Our watered down, cheap drinks were 8 dollars each. The two ladies behind the bar seemed to have little idea what they were doing. Blaring Mexican ranchero music. An interior decor that doesn't make much sense.

There's a pool table in the other room but i've never played. Happy to just be sitting at the bar. The music is a bit on the loud side to have a normal conversation but what's a bar without loud music? If you expect a dive bar, this place is for you.

Why are dive-bars great?  ...well, they're not.  Why are they good?  ...  You can come in, pretension-free, grab some drinks and relax.  This is an adequate, if average at best, spot.\n\nThings you want in a dive-bar:  Cheap drinks.  Not here.  Entertaining bartenders who bring a lot of local color to the table.  Ehhh....  Some sort of amusing, although harmless drama.  Haven't seen it.  Good sight-lines to the TV's to catch a game.  Not so much.\n\nThings you don't want in a dive-bar:   Murder.  No murder here.  Crazy (not in the good way) people.  It's been a pretty good crowd.  Indifferent service.  Actually, they do fine, although it's nothing special.\n\nSo perfectly adequate, but nothing special.  The one thing, to me, that elevates this from 2-stars to 3-stars is that it has a kind of kitschy, old-school decor that endears itself.  There is also a cool tradition of tricking-out your dollar bill and stapling it to the ceiling.  Check out the pics.  (I'm convinced that these end up in someone's pocket eventually, since I haven't found a couple of my dollars from past trips.)\n\nIt's worth a try.

Only but about 10 minutes later the bartender started yelling at the whole table behind the counter, that this isn't a restaurant and we need to buy more drinks now.  Some of the people in the group were driving and weren't drinking.  The bar was empty anyways and only had about 3 people sitting at the main counter, which it seemed like she was trying to impress and make laugh.  She was also ordering the table around and constantly yelling out random things.  It seemed like she was drunk on the job, but still this was unacceptable behavior.  If you're going to be drunk on the job, hold it together.  When we finally got up to leave because the girls got fed up with her, she yelled even more and commanded us to come back and order drinks.   \n\nWe originally went here for the pool table.

However, there are plenty of dive bars that are fun , and this is not one of them.  We played pool and get this, they don't have an 8 ball, but they do have an extra ball.  So, during our game we kept reminding each other that the \"dirty\" stripe was our \"8.\"  The music was terrible and not in a hipster ironic way.\n\nI'm giving this place two stars instead of one because of the bartender/waitress that came over to me and told me I should play pool with my purse on instead of leaving it on the stool by the pool table.  For a split second I thought that was a little excessive, but then I thought, \"Well, this is the TL and she should know.... so...\"  (As an aside, I blame my barely losing the game to my balance being thrown off because of said purse.)\n\nWell, I'm glad I listened to her.  Not 5 minutes later, in walks some riff-raff, crazy guy.  (Not judging, just describing.)  He starts harrasing/begging to this couple that were waiting to play pool and then he came over to us, and then we promptly left.  Given what the bartender said to me, (and I'm grateful), I take it that this kind of thing happens on a regular basis.\n\nOh, and it smelled a little bit.  I'm not sure what the smell was and I really don't want to know... but it was there.", "author": "Chloe M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-06-17", "description": "True story. \n\nA bunch of us were out in the city one rainy winter night in '05 or '06, a time when I was living in Oakland and in fact was still new to the Bay area, so a night out in San Francisco was still something along the lines of special. Anyway, we got dinner somewhere, sushi I think on Post, and got tipsy enough to decide to make a whiz-bang night of it. At the time, this meant heading to the Owl Tree (rest in peace; I refuse to call the current decolletage-drenched establishment the same Owl Tree run by C. Bobby (rest, again, in peace you lovely curmudgeon)), which we did, but which was muy crowded and therefore untenable for we thirtysomething curmudgeons-in-training*. So where to next?, we wondered. Figuring Geary to be a better option than most we headed downhill along Taylor and looked both ways. \n\nNow, currently the picture on Yelp for this bar is of the Hi-Tide's signage, which is, um, inviting to certain types of sots. My friends and I were then, and pretty much still are now, exactly those sots, and now that I think about it I believe it was that night when we made the rule that any bar with a neon martini glass outside of it, olived or no, is worth seeing the inside of. Moth-like, we flitted over and saw the inside of it, taking up shop in a booth right by the bar.\n\nA couple whiskeys in and we got to thinking about the weed that one of us so happened to be carrying on his person (kind of a rarity, unlike with many of our fellow Bay Areans^). Another of us so happened to be carrying rolling papers--ibid. as to being a rarity--and the next thing we knew we were...crumbling the weed onto the table and getting it ready for a joint. Which we rolled. At that table, which was, I feel compelled to remind you, right in front of the bar, and by \"right\" I mean \"two feet\" and by \"in front\" I mean \"away,\" so, yeah, two feet from the bar, rolling a joint. \n\nFurthermore, I believe I mentioned we a) were drunk, and b) not normally given to this sort of behavior, public or otherwise. Which is to say, it took us, you know, several minutes to put this thing together. But put it together we did, and to celebrate such a feat we decided to, alley oop, light it, the feat, right there at the table, that same table \"right\" \"in front\" of the bar. Because, why not?\n\nYeah, so we were semi-ceremoniously shooed out of the bar by the fiftysomething semi-English-speaking barmaid, to which request we acquiesced to a minimum standard. By that I mean we stepped outside and smoked the joint on the street  **right beneath that glorious, glorious sign**  and then walked right back in as if nothing happened. \n\nOf course, telling this story now, in 2012, when, eg, it's more illegal in New York City to carry around a Big Gulp filled with Coke than one filled with weed, this seems like no big deal. But to me, then, fresh off the train from the midwest where it was fifty degrees colder and fifty thousand billion times less hospitable to public joint-rolling and -smoking, it was one more reason to call this town Heaven. \n\nBut it's still a dive bar and a dump inside and actually kind of depressing, depending on when you go, so you get 3 stars, Hi-Tide, because you're A-OK.\n\n\n*Along these lines, my friends and I subscribe to Esquire's Rule #1478 (or whatever number it is): No one ever sits in a bar and thinks, You know what, the music could actually be *louder*. \n\n^Yikes; that sure sounds a lot like Bay Aryans.", "author": "T U."}

I have walked by you numerous times, always with the assumption that you were dark inside, and more sinister. But alas, you are not. Maybe you were at some point, but you are not now.\n\nAnother disappointingly well-lit \"dive\" bar. I think the modern-looking green lights are recently-installed, and I can only imagine how much better it would be without them, especially with that faux-stone wall littered with foreign currency. But other aesthetic touches were perfect - the floor was filthy, the red carpeting on the side of the bar was held together with duct tape, and then there was the painting. The proudly displayed centerpiece of the bar, a painting of a lady of unknown Asiatic descent, draped partially in a white feather boa, her right breast unashamedly exposed. My complete disinterest in breasts aside, I found this to be the best feature of this establishment.\n\nThe booths with tiny tables were an interesting feature, upon which we noticed that some people were eating a mysterious green substance from a red basket. Apparently the bar snacks here are not the traditional pretzels and nuts, but some sort of dried seaweed snack.\n\nWe also liked the unexplained window in the stairway leading to the lavatory. I made Lady Pestlebottom wave to me from it on her way to relieve herself. \n\nOther than those unique touches, I found this to be quite a boring drinking establishment. Mainly due to the patronage, which consisted of university student-types, and young boring persons of several ethnicities. Several youngsters were playing billiards, which is not our cup of tea. The overall mood was jovial, in a completely uninteresting way. \n\nThe music that was played from the juke-box was insufferable, ranging from the horrible modulated-voice dance music, to Mexican ballads, to Britney Spears to The Doors. An odd assortment. Lady Pestlebottom was confused and horrified that I was able to identify a Britney Spears song within the first five notes. Or at all. \n\nWhat I'm endlessly searching for is the type of tavern in which one can barely see one's hand in front of one's face for the reddened darkness, and the purpose of which is to drink sullenly and quietly at the end of the bar, lamenting the futility of life until last call, or at least until one passes out in one's bourbon. And also the type of place in which one could discreetly give or receive a hand job at the bar without another's notice or care. Alas, this place was none of those things. \n\nAs for other reviewer's remarks about smoke and urine odors, I noticed neither (well, there was a urine odor in the bathroom, where it's supposed to be).

Wow, I am clearly slippin (off my chair after a drink here)\n\nSo last night, my buddy Sean and I hit up the House of Shields and ran into a co-worker and pretty much crashed his date (Sorry about that, Steve). We then all got to talking about what makes for a good dive bar and instantly, the Hi-Tide Lounge popped into my head. \n\nFor me a good dive bar should have most of these elements...\n\n-Old men drinking booze without mixers\n-A bar top your elbows will stick to\n-A \"we don't really give a shit\" attitude by the bartender, but friendly at the same time\n-Some sort of really bad neon beer sign that is burned out in a few places on the neon strips\n-Locals only\n-A really bad bathroom, often missing toilet paper and definitely without toilet seat covers\n-No friggin hipsters\n\nIf you can muster up a few of those, then i think you fairly should receive the \"Dive Bar\" crown and rock it. Hi-Tide definitely rocks all of these elements and also has books on the honor system here that they will pretty much let you borrow and then bring back without question. I still have Mussles: A Novel by Phillip Quinn Morris on my desk here at work. One of my co-workers \"borrowed\" it about a year and a half ago and has yet to return it, but don't worry Hi-Tide, I will bring it back to you one of these days :) Promise.", "author": "Stephy S."}

I'm not sure why, but I think that we may both be a little bit sick in the head. \n\nAmbiance? Nope. I'm pretty sure that ambiance was not in the vocabulary of whomever decorated this place. Actually, they probably didn't even HAVE a vocabulary. We decided pretty promptly that the Hi-Tide is a living creature, that sustains on the sadness and perversion of others.\n\nThere's something tragic and gross about this bar, and that makes it all the more entertaining. Who ARE the people here? Do they live nearby? Are they passing through? Nearly everyone in here was single, and not the proud single that you often see out at bars, but the sad, slightly drunk, gonna go home and beat off to some foot fetish videos later kind. \n\nI'm pretty sure the bartender hated me. A lot of female bartenders deal with scary drunk men, but don't enjoy the attention. This woman, however, seemed to truly enjoy the adoration she was getting. I ordered a Jack and Coke that was $6 and mostly Coke. Actually, I think it was DIET Coke. We watched in amazement as the bartender lovingly stroked and massaged a hulking old gentleman's paw. She cooed and blinked her eyes and acted like a little girl. I wonder if she learned to do that at the \"massage\" joint across the street. The gentleman left the bar, but not before leaving her a $50 tip. \n\nYeah.\n\nThe jukebox here is a time machine. I'm sure of it! I didn't even feel like I was in San Francisco. It seemed like we were at a bar just off of the freeway somewhere in the southwest. And with Elton John's \"Rocket Man\" blaring on the jukebox, anything was possible. At the end of the bar, two sad-looking men sat together and commiserated. We sat across the room, watching and silently willing the men to kiss before the song ended.\n\nThere is a painting behind the bar of a shirtless woman with a bad perm. She is surrounded by what looks like feathers, but it could also be a dead poodle. \n\nI left this bar feeling like I'd just gotten my brain re-wired. There's seriously and truly something wrong with the Hi-Tide, and I like it a lot.", "author": "Pamela D."}

So in this case I go with the local beer, why? you may ask, because local beers in tourist locations tend to be ordered more often than national brands (I know I do it on vacation).

We sat down at the bar, and I asked the Asian bartender lady for a glass of water.  She told me she would not serve me unless I ordered alcohol.  I didn't want more alcohol, I wanted water.  So my boyfriend pacified her by ordering a beer and a shot of tequila while I headed to the bathroom.  The ladies bathroom was unoccupied, but the door was stuck.  So two nice Latino men told me I could use the men's room.  Of course, the door didn't lock, but I was undeterred because I really needed to go.  I went into the only stall and, as I was peeing, a man STUCK HIS HEAD UNDER THE STALL DOOR to cop an eyeful of my ladyparts.  When I came out and told the bartender about this, she yelled at me for not using the ladies room  - with the non-functioning door.  No reason to go here unless you like pervy entertainment, in which case my experience was 4 stars.", "author": "H. A."}

I can only imagine that the job interview for the barkeep position went:  \"Do you know how to make classic cocktails?\"  \"No.\"  \"Do you know how to look cute and be flirty?\" \"Yes.\"  \"You're hired!\"  Because, really, the bartendress did not know how to make a manhattan, but she sure had the guys at the bar eating out of her hand.  It's a good thing the guys were beer drinkers and she only had to open bottles.  I don't expect the antics of \"Cocktail\" or \"Coyote Ugly\" but I DO expect bartenders to be able to make basic cocktails.  Add a mix of predictable hits *yawn* of the 80s and 90s played waaay too loud, and you have the recipe for a bar we decided we'll never patronize again.", "author": "maiko h."}

Maybe you are one of my 4 fans. Yeah that's right I have 4! \nWell if so you know I am a drunk, so it will not surprise you that last night I got drunk and decided since my beloved had never been to the high tide that we needed to stop there on our stumble home for one last drink. \nWell damn if I wasn't shocked to find the place crammed full of people. Who would have thought. Not me I guess, I always seem to be here when there are only other bar flys such as myself milling about enjoying the free microwave popcorn, the sumptuous decor, eclectic jukebox and lovely bartender. \nOk well apparently people from Alameda come here on Wednesday nights too? Yeah I verbally assaulted a perfectly nice couple who probably met on the internet and were on their second or third date, what can I say I like to try and make friends. \nI do not think they were interested in my drunk talk, sorry Alameda folks I hope you got home safely. \nAnyway what I really want to say about the High tide is that like every other divey bar in my hood I will be there drinking my youth away, what's that oh yeah youth already drunk away, ok then on to my middle age, and enjoying minute of it.", "author": "Melissa H."}

Do I not get out enough?) and lo, there was Janis, Willie, Al Green, Patsy Cline, Jimi, Tina, the Stones....in between the contemoporary boring no-names (don't flame me you young folks!). 3 for a buck 6 for 2, and a pool table.

Anyway, this is a fabulous dive bar, with non-dive bar tendencies- 1) they have every Britney CD on the jukebox. They also have Now Volumes 9-14. So fabulous. 2) the crowd varies from scary Loin denizens and those who wandered over from the Ambassador. So, one night, I saw a man try to sell my friend crack and was sitting on his hands so he'd stop scratching himself sitting next to a woman dressed in an chinchilla coat and a Marc Jacobs bag, trying to figure out where the heck she was. And my friend was ironic enough to order many, many cosmos and they were all very good. Now, that is a one great bar. Minus one star for allowing smoking inside, even when there's no smoking signs all over the place.", "author": "Noelle Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-12-25", "description": "Reading the previous reviews leads me to believe most critics haven't experienced the Hi Tide on more than a couple occasions. This is not a bar for all tastes, to put it mildly. The crowd leans towards the over-40, extra-drunk archetype, with associated loud singing to bad pop songs and inappropriate cross-bar ogling. \n\nSome may develop the impression that the Hi Tide is a Asian \"escort\" bar, and I can't say with certainty they are wrong. Exhibit A - the pricey drinks. Paying more than $5 for a basic well drink should always raise a red flag in any divey establishment like the Hi Tide. Exhbit B would have to be the framed portrait of a nude matriarch whose name escapes me at the moment. Scant evidence, I know, but don't blame me if you end up getting a back-room handjob during those black-out hours of your Saturday night. \n\nExpensive drinks, unappealing crowd and bad music make this an infrequent destination despite its close proximity to my apartment. For those of you searching for a \"my very own dive bar adventure\", this place will probably pass muster. Others will likely be looking for the door after they finish chugging their weak, seven-dollar well cocktail. \n\nNOTE: this used to be a smoking bar, but no longer.", "author": "Phil D."}

Im not sure if yu-me or yummie is still working the bar but i miss my times with her. This is my start it off and often finish it off dive bar. Really i just cant help but enjoy a dive that lets me order flaming shots and then asks me for the ingredients, allowing me to do my part in keeping the only good thing to come out of the eighties bar scene alive. After a night of over the top cocktails with ingredient lists containing more items then most dinner menus it nice to find a smelly, dirty, faded, lop-sided pool table having, dive bar complete with crappy jukebox perpetually playing the obligatory sing along anthems of every low brow establishment from here to buffalo. nothing says hello evening like a Flaming doctor pepper, and nothing says good night San Francisco like a shot of fernet and a cheap beer.

After a typical happy hour at Swig (fun, fabulous, cool people), and some very filling Indian food at Chutney, our group had to figure out where the night was heading. The neon lights of the Hi-Tide beckoned, and we went in. Our bartenders gave us the once over but once the budweisers and whiskeys started flowing all was good. The jukebox was just plain odd - my first selection of songs included AC/DC's Shook Me All Night Long, Sympathy for the Devil, Stacey's Mom, and then later N'Sync's Bye Bye Bye, and I think Elton John's Our Song (WTF?). Drunken dancing and bumping ensued, and the bar magically got busier and busier. At closing time, our bartenders were almost sad to be closing, but I assured them, \"I'd see them tomorrow.\" Is the Hi-Tide for you? I'm not really sure, but there are a few perfect moments in one's life where good friends come together haphazardly and lives intersect and you know that life is pretty damn near heaven.
