We stopped by after to grab a cream puff. \n\nI'd never heard of a place that specializes in cream puffs so this was an exciting day for me. \n\nYou choose what kind of puff and cream you want inside. My two coworkers got the original with vanilla filling. I had the eclair puff with hazelnut cream. Once I saw it, I was worried the cream would be more like frosting but it did have the creamy, custard texture. It was delicious.

Oh hell yes. Choose the puff that you want--plain or dipped in chocolate(eclair) and filling flavor. Matcha and vanilla bean are the best flavaflavs. Not to sweet, cool and flavorful. My fave combo is a chocolate dipped puff with matcha filling. Bomb AF!\n\nI've tried their Paris Brest (donut shaped pastry w/choice of filling), their Tiramisu pastry stick and they were just as tasty AF. The 'fondant' cakes on the other hand are a pass. I tried the green tea one and it tasted like an uncooked cake with runny matcha filling inside. Not a fan...\n\nOverall, beard papa knows what's up in the cream puff dept. They're a little bit pricey ($3+ for 1?) but I say it's worth it...for SF lol.

We then proceeded to go over this conversation with the newly opened Bake Cheese Tart (yup, it's not Baked Cheese Tart), but I digress....\n\nIn my mind's eye, Beard Papa's has always been an upscale sort of treat. Maybe it's specific to this particular store, but I left feeling like the spot had been knocked down a rung. The paint on the counters and walls was chipped in a number of places, the trash bins were overflowing, and the tables and chairs looked quite worn and cheap (not to mention dirty). We got a matcha cream puff (although they're marketed as eclairs now) with matcha filling. \n\nPerhaps it's because the shell wasn't fresh out of the oven, but it was very...normal. The green tea (plus white chocolate) shell on top didn't particularly add any green tea flavor. The filling was surprisingly somewhat strong on the green tea flavor. Compared to last week's adventures in transplanted Asian dessert-land, this was certainly a larger dessert and lasted more bites. Cream was not too sweet and definitely light. In terms of would I come back though? Hard to see myself doing that anytime soon, when a box of those Costco mini cream puffs (omg I love those things) would suffice.", "author": "Nicole H."}

So I got the Honey and Butter puff with matcha inside. My bf got the Chocolate (eclair) puff with caramel inside. I got my sister a Matcha (eclair) puff with vanilla ice cream filling (extra $.75 for ice cream filling). We all agreed that it only tasted alright - not flavorful. Honestly there wasn't much flavor to the fillings at all. They also didn't really fill the puffs up so half of it was empty. I remember last time we were here the fillings were oozing out of the puffs. My sister said she couldn't taste the matcha on the outside of the puffs. All this for $11.25. Pretty pricy tbh.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-27", "description": "Recommendation: Great niche dessert place. Menu layout was a little confusing. Maybe a little on the pricey side for what you are getting. \n\nBeard Papa is a little shop right outside the Metreon building that specializes in creme-filled pastries. Mostly known for their cream puffs, they also serve eclairs and different, crunchy varieties. You can typically order from a few different flavors of pastry, and then you also get to choose the cream on the inside from the typical flavors (chocolate, vanilla) and the flavor of the month (March was cookies and cream, a grey speckled goo). \n\nThe pastries themselves are quite good, but considering they are $3 a piece or so it's not the most cost-efficient way to gain a sugar rush. That being said, the creme is delicious as always and the pastries are filled on the spot, so they are always a perfect texture. \n\nThere are only a couple tables inside and outside so if there isn't much space, I'd suggest going across Mission Street to the Yerba Buena Garden area or into the Metreon building to sit around in the expansive first floor seating area. \n\nAll in all, I'd say it is worth it to try Beard Papa's at least once, and maybe bring friends here to marvel in the wonder of instant cream puffs!", "author": "John B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-24", "description": "I definitely looked like a bearded papa after eating three of these cream puffs...that wasn't necessarily the goal, but I was feeling ravenous and when that hunger hits, I just dig right into my food, mindless of the mess I will make.  I had actually bought these cream puffs and brought them back to my hotel so as to enjoy breakfast in bed...I thought it'd be all luxurious, but I ended up just making a big flaky, creamy mess for the hotel maids to clean up later.\n\nThese cream puffs are delicate little things - the cream will ooze out the minute you bite into it so be prepared to lick all the cream off before it falls to the floor.  Let's play a little game of, 'Don't drop the cream!'.  These things are not only delicate, but also fairly small.  They aren't so small in that it's not worth buying them; I would actually say that for their size, they are filled with cream!  What's great about this place is that you can actually choose which filling you want.  I had come on a day where there was a bunch of construction outside and I guess they were preparing to close down temporarily because of it so there were limited flavors available.  They only had the vanilla and chocolate fillings available; and as for the glazed puff itself: only strawberry, green tea, chocolate and vanilla were available.  I was so looking forward to trying all these other flavors, but that wasn't in the cards for me that day.\n\nThere was a selection of cream puffs already to go, but then you had the option of picking and choosing your puff and your cream.  For each cream puff, either created by yourself or pre-prepared, it was about $3-4, so I ended up walking away having spent about $12 on cream puffs.  I didn't blink too much of an eye at this because I do love cream puffs...in fact, these cream puffs made for a breakfast of champions.  They didn't hold me over for long and their sugary base probably wasn't good for my diet, but they tasted pretty good in the moment.", "author": "Lauren K."}

They had a good balance of sweetness (not terribly sweet), and found their size a little amusing. They're HUGE compared to the ones I've had elsewhere.\n\nThat said, maybe I'm just not a cream puff person. I'd much rather eat a good brownie, cookie, or even slice of cake. I didn't care for the cream puffs at Odette in Paris (which is supposed to be known for their cream puffs) either. So I'd say - if you're the kind of person that likes cream puffs, it's worth a try!

You get a fairly large cream puff with 2 pumps of cream filling. But recently I have been asking if I could get an extra pump and they happily did! How awesome is that? Their standard flavor is vanilla and chocolate but if you are lucky enough to get some seasonal flavors you could get mango, which is my favorite, or green tea. I've also seen coffee and caramel but neither interests me. I just wish they offered more flavors like they do on their website. I would love to try TARO cream! You also have 3 choices of puffs. You can get original, cookie crunch, which is my favorite or chocolate. I always ask no powered sugar because whenever I bite into these guys I end up inhaling the powdered sugar and start to cough like mad, so I always skip it but you have to tell them in advance because they won't ask you.", "author": "Vinkin Ken T."}

Although each cream puff costs several dollars, I figure it's way easier and cheaper to just buy one here whenever I have a craving, vs. trying to make my own.

I've had 'em in NYC, and now I've had 'em in San Francisco.\n\nThis Beard Papa is tucked next to the Yerba Buena Gardens--I don't think you'd be able to find this place unless you were on a dedicated mission. It's on a small street that you can't really see from the front, so we had to do a weird square around it to access it from behind. There is some seating inside, but there is also seating outside as well. \n\nThere are regular vanilla custard-filled cream puffs and cream puffs topped with a cookie crunch topping. There's also a rotating flavor that changes depending on when you visit. When we went, the flavor was Mocha. \n\nWe got a regular puff filled with Mocha and a Cookie Crunch filled with Vanilla. Those babies got *inhaled*. And not just \"eaten-quickly\" inhaled, this was the type of devouring that got cream filling and crumbs all over your face, hands, fingers, and no matter how many napkins you used, you still kept finding bits of glorious cream puff on you. \n\nThe regular vanilla custard is reliable and delectable. The mocha is a nice switch up and is a little less sweet and tangy compared to the vanilla. The cookie crunch puff is a little harder and crunchier than the flaky standard puff, but I couldn't taste a huge difference. I prefer the standard puff because it allows me to focus on the filling. \n\nBasically, these are an awesome treat. The only place I've ever been to that comes close (and due to personal preference, some actually like it better) is Pacific Puffs. The actual puff part of Beard Papa's puffs is pretty flaky, and Pacific Puffs holds up and is more solid. Beard Papa also jam packs the puffs full of cream so that when you take your first bite, the filling oozes out. Some think it's too sweet because of the filling, but the filling really isn't that sweet. The treat doesn't have that much sugar in it compared to other pastries, so you don't feel like you have to brush your teeth afterward lest you get a cavity.", "author": "Nicole O."}

She was complaining in Spanish to her 2 co-workers that I was taking too long to order. It wasn't even 5 seconds, Sheez! and I was her only customer at the time too.\n\nNormally bakeries/ pastry shops that sell sweet products, hire cheerful people to match the food they sell. The manager of this branch didn't get that memo. The employees looked unhappy, with a deadpan, monotone voice and blank facial expressions, like if either they were inside a jail or they thought that they're too cool to work in that job, not sure. Definitely a disincentive to buy more stuff.\n\nI just came here to try the new mini-croissants, available in 3 flavors: butter (regular), chocolate and cheese (cream cheese). Sold by 3 for $2.95/$3.45, 1/2 dozen for $5.25/$6.25, or one dozen for $10/$12. I bought a mix to try every flavor. The \"Petit-cro\" looked nice and tasted okay, but the inside is a little dry. Perhaps better when eaten while sipping on a cup of hot coffee or tea. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/fO4nmPfUwyyzLDRxOIwuVg/l\n\nThe \"Fondant au chocolat\" are little cupcake size chocolate cakes filled with chocolate that melts after they warm it in a microwave. Nothing to rave about. If u still want something similar, go to TJ's instead for a cheaper version in the frozen foods aisle. The \"Cheese cake stick\" (regular, strawberry and tiramisu) is another disappointing item, it's a small layer of cheesecake sliced into strips. I'd rather have a slice of dense NY-style or Zanze's light cheesecakes instead.\n\nI'm not a fan of the cream puffs at this store (maybe I got poorly made ones, don't know), although I really liked the ones I tried at Beard Papa's in Waikiki, inside the Food Pantry market.

My mother is a cream puff connoisseur and makes amazing ones herself!  When she came to visit me in the city, I wanted to treat her to one and get her opinion.\n\nWell, it was probably one of the worst experiences from a customer service standpoint I'd ever encountered. \n\nThe advertised opening time (online and store front) for Saturday is 9am.  So, we show up at 9am.  Another family had driven over an hour to buy  a box to take back with them - also waiting at 9am.  The cream puff specialist was clearly inside, blasting hispanic music and ignoring the line of people waiting.  When my sweet mother went to knock on the door as it's now 9:10, she cracked it open and said 15 minutes and locked the door back up.\n\nPlease note: their cream puffs are delicious!!!  I give this product 5 stars *****\n\nBut, this employee who seems to be sneaking some puffage herself (nothing wrong with being jolly) was just plain salty! \n\nWhen we were finally \"allowed\" in, she was so rude I didn't even want to give this place our business - although only worth a couple of cream puffs, it's the principle!\n\nSO - I like to give places and people a second chance and we returned the next day.  My mom wanted to get some for my other family members visiting...but yep, same salty lady, same attitude.

We just wanted a small snack.  We happened across this place on the way back to the parking garage. \n\nI am sure that everyone has had one of those tiny frozen creme puffs that you can get at Costco or Sams Club.  I think most grocery stores sell them too.  Our family likes to eat them frozen however, that is not how they are supposed to be served.\n\nWhen you walk into this place they have the \"puffs\" already made.  They are about the size of the palm of my hand.  (I wear a L/XL glove).  They ask you what flavor of creme you want.  I got vanilla which is the kind that comes in the ones from Costco/Sams.  My husband got Chocolate and then there is another flavor they have all the time then each week they have a \"flavor of the week\".  Let me tell you some of the flavors sounded SO good but we were not in the right week LOL (looks like we will be going back).\n\nOnce you choose your flavor they have a machine that looks like a super large needle and they put the puff on it and pull the handle and it fills the puff.\n\nI expected this to be not so good.  I am not huge on super sugary stuff so I cringed at the first bite.  *musical notes plow through your head as your mouth tastes this savory goodness\" is exactly how I explained it to my husband LOL.  He agreed it was really good.\n\nI can't speak for the chocolate flavor because I did not try it.  It was a dark chocolate and I am not a fan of anything but Milk Chocolate.  My husband ate all of it so it couldn't have been that bad.\n\nThe Vanilla - - WOW - I expected it to be like a pudding consistancy but it wasn't.  It was a mix between pudding and Cool Whip.  It was not sweet it was just creamy goodness with a hint of vanilla flavor.\n\nIf you get a chance to stop in . . . I would highly recommend it.

In fact, the cream puff has a double-crusted shell --- the hard exterior is European, and the softer inside is Japanese. I imagine the combination makes it easier to package than the standard open-shell choux that real bakeries use. But honestly, it just looks like a molded fritter.\r\n\r\nPapa, can you taste it?\r\n\r\nThe filling is custardy with a hint of vanilla unless of course, you get the chocolate or green tea variations. Personally I find the whole tasting experience rather generic. It's not disgusting, just wholly unmemorable. There is obviously some master plan to make this chain the next Krispy Kreme, but it seems inherently self-limiting to produce these cream-filled eclairs, disguise them as cream puffs and expect people not to get tired of them at some point.\r\n\r\nPapa, can you serve it?\r\n\r\nThe service is efficient, and the lines are managed to the best of the staff's abilities.

At first, I felt cheated, but I realized that one of the issues I had before with their puffs was cream to shell ratio, so I guess they addressed this.  However, I need to subtract a star.\n\n\n***Review for all Beard Papa locations***\nShoe Cream?!?  No, Chou-Cream!!!\n\nJapan did not invent Cream Puffs, or choux a la creme, but the French import with Japanese twist had been popular for years before Beard Papa came around in 1999.  What differentiated Beard Papa's cream puff was that they would fill the shell with vanilla cream after the order was placed, keeping the crust crisp.  Muginoho, the company behind Beard Papa Brand, seems to understand creating scalable food businesses, creating franchise stores all over Japan.\n\nMy first Beard Papa experience was in Shibuya, Tokyo, when a dangerous aroma invaded my nose as I was coming out of the subway station.  The smell was so inviting that even Hachiko (statue of a dog) was ready to head to Beard Papa.  There was a long line, so I waited patiently for my Shoe Cream...I mean Choux-Cream.  From the first bite, I could tell it was something special.  No other puff was as crispy and had the fresh vanilla taste.  I later learned that they use natural vanilla beans, instead of artificial flavorings.  If you see black dots in the cream, it is actually flakes of vanilla.  Their shell has a patent in Japan.  \n\nI am so glad to see Beard Papa doing so well in the U.S.  I am hoping that other Japanese franchises, seeing the success of Muginoho and Delica R/F-1 (http://www.yelp.com/biz/xlXnPitrO9Mjfq3aPAyNVQ) and Santouka Ramen (http://www.yelp.com/biz/8oQW63QAXDaGfIWAQzmI0g), decides to open stores in California.  Sure, Bay Area people hate big businesses like McDonalds, but these are the only companies with resources to expand their chains globally.  No mom & pop operation in Japan could take the risk to test the market in the U.S.  Hey, all I care is that I get to enjoy my cream puffs.  \n\n\n---Original Review on 12 May 2006-----------\nBeard Papa cream puffs has arrived in SF!!!  For the first 50 customers (each of the first 5 days), with a purchase of dozen cream puffs, they were giving out a stainless bottle with Papa's logo with quotes \"Let's go on a picnic.\" (see picture) Well, now you can purchase a dozen of their puffs for $20 and picnic at Yerba Buena Garden.  There was a huge line on the opening day on 12 May 2006, but I'm sure it will cook down in a couple of weeks.  \n\nSo, where is this Yerba Buena Lane?  Don't follow the Google map.  YB Lane is a new pedestrian walk way that gets you from Market Street to Mission St between 3rd and 4th.  Beard Papa is visible from Mission Street, next to St. Patrick's Church.  Beard Papa is technically in the same building as Marriott Hotel (not accessible from the hotel).\n\nSo, how good was it?  Well, as good as one's I've had in Shibuya, Tokyo.  Creamy filling with crispy shell.  $1.75/pc is quite reasonable - if you consider paying $5 for a piece of cake at Just Desserts across the street at Sony Metreon.  I'm just glad it's now here!\n\nUPDATE (7/9/2006)\nI went there on Saturday afternoon to pick up more cream puffs and found a line (probably 30 min?).  While I still believe this is a 5 Star place, cream puffs are not worth a 30 min wait.  No puffs are worth that much trouble.  I really hope the buzz cools down so that I could start enjoying Beard Papa's on regular basis.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

Before there was Beard Papa on the mainland, I used to hit up the Beard Papa in Honolulu every.single.day like some kind of addict. When they opened a location in New York, I made a SPECIAL TRIP to have them. It's so amazing to have Beard Papa just a few blocks away from me now. The custard cream filling is incredibly fresh and yummy. They fill the pastry only after you order, so the pastry stays crisp and not soggy. I like to get the cookie crunch pastry shell for the texture. The chocolate dipped shell is also yummy, though it'd be nice if they used a dark chocolate instead of a milk chocolate. But the main star is the fresh pastry cream in VANILLA (do not deviate from vanilla). You can see the real vanilla bean specks and it's just sweet enough. Considering cupcakes run $3.50-$4 each and, in my opinion, are way way easier to make, these cream puffs are quite a steal. They used to be like $2.25 but I think they're up to $2.75 now. For all the people complaining that the pastry cream filling is cold, that's because it is fresh pastry cream made with fresh milk and no preservatives and no weird gunky stabilizers and texturizes like carrageenan or whatever. It needs to be cold just like milk needs to be cold. I think Americans forget what it's like to eat non processed foods. It's a delicate fresh puff, not a cadbury egg that can sit on a shelf for years!", "author": "Cat M."}

It made me think of Papa Smurf... but I didn't like the cream puffs as much as I like the 1980s little blue cartoons. \n\n* FAB location next to Schoggi chocolates of Switzerland... and nice clean design, like a factory tour: video of how cream puffs are made and clear glass, so you can see the workers make your order. Chocolate and regular puffs sit on trays; the drill pump device injects cream into the puff.\n\n* BEST aroma -- baked goody smell. Cool concept: vanilla, chocolate, or the cream flavor of the week (changed on Fridays). At the beginning of the week, I got a reg. puff with green tea filling... the puff was dusted with green tea powdered sugar too. OK taste, not too sweet -- but not addictive as other Yelpers make it seem.\n\n* I visited on a second occasion to test consistency of the quality. Customer service was lacking both times. If workers are not pleasant, it dampens my enthusiasm for your treats. \n\n** BTW when you saw that I was NOT HAPPY (but DISAPPOINTED) with my order (b/c you didn't read it back to me and I got something different than what I intended -- and I didn't even bite into the puff) you SHOULD HAVE offered me what I wanted: a baked chocolate puff filled with coffee cream, the flavor of the week. \n\nWhat I got: a regular puff with chocolate cream filling. \n\nNote: There's a Beard Papa's in the food court of the Westfield San Francisco center at 5th Street and Market... but the mall setting really cramps the magical factory feeling. They sell the same widgets anyway.\n\nThey also sell \"sticks\" of cheesecake. Picture a slightly skinner stick of butter, but made of cheesecake -- not butter.

I prefer going to the store and buying my cream puffs to go and take the bag to the garden and sit in the grass and people watch.  It's so relaxing!\n\nPuffs:  The pastry shell is a oversized puff that is soft but has a crusty top that you can just tear into. You can just smell the pastry when you first walk in if they are still baking in the oven that is location right behind the counter. \n\nVanilla custard filling:  has specks of vanilla bean, the custard is not sweet and does not have the egg smell or after taste.  The puffs normally include 3 pumps of the custard which is way to much for me, so I always get half the amount.\n\nStrawberry filling:  fresh strawberries enveloped with a whip cream like filling.  The consistency is light.\n\nAnd of course all of the puffs are topped off with powered sugar.  So if you don't like having powdery sugared lips/ mouth, then you should request for non.  I always look like Tyrone the crack head from the Dave Chappelle's show when I finish eating..  :)\n\nI wouldn't recommend anyone ever getting the eclairs or the other bake goods, they are either made way in advance or pre-made.", "author": "Angel N."}

The Green Tea isn't too bad, but it's more mild than the Vanilla (a little smoother, maybe a little less fat). \n\nCertainly, one of Beard Papa's cream puffs is best with a cup of black coffee.

I mean, I don't think the typical SF food entrepreneur would think to start a cream puff shop with a cute but cryptic old-man-of-the-sea mascot named \"Beard Papa\".  Right?  Then there's the fact that they have a spot in the Westfield food court in addition to the (preferable) Yerba Buena Lane location--so you know there's some money behind this little operation.\n\nNow frankly, I've never been too excited about cream puffs.  And while BP does seem to uphold the SF tradition of freshness (did you know they inject the cream into the puff right there in front of you?  Not too shabby), they don't single-handedly reinvent the genre.  Honestly, the custard is just kind of bland (yes, even the chocolate version).  Seems to me like these babies need a long list of exotic (and while we're at it, local/seasonal/organic) filling flavors.  Now *that* would be a 5-star sweet shop.", "author": "Wes M."}

I've seen it in Southern CA but avoided it probably due to its name and logo.  I mean, its name sounds like a Smurf-themed sex shop or gay Bear bar.  I'm also not attracted to the Gordon Fisherman meets Chef Boyardee logo of an old man puffing on a pipe while I'm eating.\n\nThis Japanese-based pastry shop I guess started out in Osaka (where my mom used to live) and I love Japanese food so I figured I should give it a try.  According to their website (best watched after you've ingested said cream puffs) the original inspiration of the cream puffs came from the original Beard Papa's .... shockingly, from his facial hair.  He also seemed to be smoking while baking these \"World's Best Cream Puffs\".  I'm not sure what the most disturbing part of those sentences are, but I'll leave that up to you to decipher.\n\nRegardless, the cream puffs are pretty damn amazing. I'm not normally a fan of puffed pastry seeded in custard and whipped cream, but stopping in was an unexpected treat.  I had the cookie crumb pastry with vanilla bean filling.  It was... awesome.  They also serve treats in stick form which is a form I am fond of.  They had tiramisu, cheesecake and strawberry.  They also have eclairs and chocolate fondant.

So I went up to the counter and the woman behind the counter said something to me.  \n\nMy brain, addled by the divine eggy-vanilla aroma, could not digest what she said immediately.  The heavy machinery of thought churned slowly, with much creaking and grunting.  My happy thoughts of pumpkin and strawberry cream puffs were being swallowed up in the cogs of--er, excuse the pun--cognition like Chaplin's Tramp in \"Modern Times.\"  Before I knew it, I heard myself saying \"THIRTY MINUTES?!?!??\"  But it probably sounded like Scooby Doo going \"Rrrraaurwhrrr?\"  The woman confirmed, yes, it's a 30 minute wait for the next batch of puffs.  I was so incredulous that I blurted out \"Not worth the wait.\" and ran out, rejected, and ran straight to BART and went home.  \n\nForgive me, I didn't mean to be so rude, but I was just so taken aback by the wait time.  The wait to get a cream puff shouldn't be so disproportionate compared to the time it takes to scarf one down.  I'm surprised they don't try harder to stagger the production so there is a constant turnover of choux going in and out of the ovens.  I mean, I can make double batches of four different cookies in my podunk home oven for Xmas in one afternoon.  Papa really needs to come up with a new system to keep the choux coming!!\n\nI do like this location better than the Westfield one because the wait is usually not as ridiculous, and on nice days, I can trot over to Yerba Buena and eat my puffs in the sun.

So I settled with the brownie looking cake with chocolate icing in the middle. I had asked them to warm it for me so that when i get to it it'll still be warm. So after my meal and chompin on some onions from the sandwich I knew that this would be a great compliment to change may pallette. After about 20 minutes it was still warma dn the filling was also still pretty wam. I bite into it and immediately I remember the chocolate icing on the Goldilocks's cakes. So I guess that was the best part, but I definitely think that if they were a bit cheaper it would be most coveted.  SO 3 stars for me", "author": "Justin G."}

I remember reading a review or two about them on Yelp and thought, \"Hey, cool!  I can actually try one now.\"  2 bites later, the thing was completely devoured and I was hunting for more.  This is what a crack fiend must feel like.\n\nLater on that night, I went to an event at the Hollywood Bowl.  On my way there, I passed by the Kodak Theatre shopping area where low and behold, they had a Beard Papa's store!  I ran in and bought a 12 pack that contained the Vanilla, Chocolate, and Milk Tea flavors.\n\nNow let me pause here for a moment.  When it comes to traveling and the extra security measures, I'm pretty patient, figuring that the important thing is that I arrive safely at my destination.  I need to get to the airport early?  No problem.  Need me to practically strip down to nothing at the security gate?  No problem.  Can't carry on anything that is even remotely liquid like?  No problem...that is, until I can't bring a box full of Beard Papa's cream puffs just because of the delicious and creamy filling!!!

I waited anxiously for opening day to come. Opening day was crazy!!! The line was out the door and down the block. They were handing out samples. I wasn't about to wait in line for that long and decided to come back when things died down a bit. \n\nThey had a promotion going on that first week. Buy 20 cream puffs and get a free thermos. I asked about the thermos and they ran out. I was a lil' disappointed so the guy gave my girlfriend and I a charm for our cell phone. That was nice of him to do that.  \n\nWhen I tasted that first puff.....oh my!!!! It was sooooo good. It wasn't too sweet. It was perfect!!!! I went back each week to taste all the other flavors. Their flavored cream puffs are \"Rotating on a weekly basis\". I like all of them except the chocolate one. It tasted funny to me. My favorite is green tea and milk tea. The milk tea puff is available in San Francisco only. The coffee one is available in Redwood City only. \n\nThey have cheesecake sticks for $1.25. It was good but not as good as a regular cheesecake. \n\nThe Fondant Au Chocolat ($2.25) is mouthwatering!!! It's not too sweet either. \n\nThe eclairs cost a little bit more than the cream puffs. I'm not very fond of them. To me, they look exactly like a cream puff except the puff part of the eclair is more dry. And the taste is.....bleh.  This may be only me though.\n\nThey had really long lines during the day time and after work for about 6 months. After that, you can just walk in any time of day and wait in line for a few minutes. \n\nOn their website you can see the flavors of the week for San Francisco. I've included a link below.\n\nhttp://www.beardpapasf.com/flavors_sf.htm \n\nGo get your puff on!!!!!\n\nEDIT 8/8/07: Just went in and saw they have gotten rid of the milk tea flavor cream puff and replaced it with tiramisu.

People stood in line in the cold and hot to catch a glimpse of this phenomenon.  Even those skeptics were generally turned into fans through first taste.  \n\n+ A Beard Papa cream puff boasts 230 calories per puff.  Though the original glazed donut from Krispy Kremes is not to be underestimated with 200 calories per holed delight.  Despite these nutritional errs, both places have succeeded in luring the health-conscious into denial through sugars and fair pricing.\n\n+  Devouring these treats is no easy feat.  One oozes sugar; the other flakes and melts into stickiness.  Both a danger to your fingers, lips, chins, cheeks, and even your shirt.\n\n+ You can smell both a least a block away.  The aroma of butter and sweet baked goodness serves as perfume to its neighbors.  Take the Beard Papa at Westfield shopping center for example...you can smell them from the 4th floor (although at first whiff, you wonder if McDonald's has infiltrated the mall and started making A LOT of eggs).  \n\n+ Alas, however, both will begin to lose it's luster (actually, for KK's, it already has.  BP's just following in its footsteps...)  Lines are no more.  People walking around the street with boxes boasting from either of these chains are almost non-existent.  (You should have SEEN the streets of Downtown when the first Beard Papa opened up.  Couldn't go anywhere without being knocked around by a yellow box.)\n\nBut, since this is a review for Beard Papa, I will say this:  they are less sweet than KK's donuts, thus enabling me to devour two to the one donut.  That effectively lifts the caloric intake to 460 against the 200 from the donut.  \n\n........\n\nI just saw that last line in actual writing.  I need to be in denial again...", "author": "Liz C."}

I mean, it's clean, nothing really wrong, but go in, order, and walk away before you try and buy more.  \n\nThese are lovely. I've always enjoyed a good cream puff, not the Chinese weird overly fatty, super sweet, no soul puffs.  I love a Japanese cream puff.  Now note:  for those not of the Asian persuasion, this probably seems weird. I mean, aren't your people lactose intollerant?  Maybe, but we love the French baking, and some things we have elevated to a new level.  White bread for toast, and cream puffs are two of them.  The French have nothing on these.\n\nI got to have a vanilla bean (my favorite thus far), chocolate, and caramel puff.  The chocolate is good, but I'm not a chocolate person.  A touch pudding-like in the middle even.  The caramel was sweet, rich, and buttery in flavor.  The vanilla bean was very vanilla, light, sweet, but not cloyingly so, and just lovely.  The pastry itself was perfectly cooked, and they make them to order in front of you. How cool is that?  They never sit and get soggy.\n\nThat's the mark of a good puff, and I'll do it again.  I think the green tea is definitely on the list to try sooner than later.", "author": "Erin O."}

Luckily, when I got there, there was no line. I wanted to try the milk tea flavor but since it was not the weekly special, I went for the original vanilla custard. I was debating to myself whether or not I should just get one or buy 6 and take them home. And then, the little voice in my head told me that if i bought the 6, i probably would've just eaten it all by myself and would've regretted it for the day. More like I would've had to force myself on the treadmill for 2 hours to burn all those unwanted calories off. So I just got one.\n\nI have to say, it wasn't anything special. It was good and the pastry was crunchy and it was airy and gooey inside. It took me less than 2 minutes to eat the whole thing. It's like the krispy kreme of cream puffs. Small and not so filling, but good enough to have more. But I'd rather have a more filling cream puff so I wouldn't want to eat any more. I sat out in front and then as I was about to leave a line started forming. I'm glad I got there when I did.  Of course, since it was a windy day I had to take a look in the mirror to make sure I didn't have any gooey gunk on my face. \nThe guy that helped me told me that they were going to have the green tea flavor next week.

For real.\n\nMy co-worker and I got a Daily Candy email one day that notified us to the cream puff bakery just two blocks (dangerous) from our place of employment.  Before lunch, we headed over and ordered the vanilla cream puff (other flavors are not currently available).  We waited a few minutes as a fresh batch of puffs came out of the oven and watched in amazement as the baker inserted the vanilla cream into the pastry.  A woman then gave the puffs a dusting of powdered sugar and handed the treats to us.\n\nAs we sat down on a sunny bench right outside, we looked at each other and exclaimed our excitement.  We both admitted, however, that we thought we didn't like cream puffs or couldn't remember having or wanting one before.  Even with this prejudice, the anticipation from the Daily Candy blurb and all of the happy customers in the surrounding area made us eager to stuff our faces.  Which we did.\n\nOh, that first bite!  The warm buttery outer layers of pastry hit my tongue and were immediately followed by the cold cream custard filling.  We exclaimed many superlatives as we ate the puffs in a 2 minute span that felt like time had stopped.  \"Look, I can see pieces of vanilla bean!\" my co-worker stated with glee.  \"It's like a vanilla cloud in my mouth!\" I replied.\n\nWe walked back to the office unable to gripe about the day's awful start and instead talked about the greatness of the puff.  The hope and excitement for two weeks to pass until we could come back when they introduce chocolate.  Oh yes, it made our day.  Thank you, papa beard.  Thank you.", "author": "Sarah L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-07-28", "description": "When I first heard Beard Papa was coming to San Francisco, I was very excited. By all accounts, their cream puffs were supposed to be the best cream puffs around, with the Japanese tailored taste improving the already yummy European cream puff. I'd heard stories about people who'd brave the lines in New York to bring home a container of Beard Papa's for their friends.\n\nI had not gotten a chance to get out to Beard Papa when it opened. Then last night, I found myself in the city and my friend asked me if we wanted to stop by Beard Papa's. I immediately said yes and we found ourselves at Yerba Buena Lane. The line wasn't too long -- only four or five people in front of us on a Thursday night. I got myself a cream puff and then purchased a box of 6 ($10) for my husband and friend who were at home. My friend purchased half a dozen specialty cream puffs -- green tea -- for about $12.\n\nTruthfully, I found the puff a bit wanting. The fabled double-layer pastry -- choux and pie crust -- didn't live up to my expectations. For something so highly touted, I would have expected a more delectable crust, slightly chewy from the choux with a little bit of bite and body from the pie crust. I don't know if mine weren't as fresh out of the oven but they were lacking in the flavor and the texture category, with the pie crust adding an unexpected bit of salt which really threw me off. The sprinkling of powdered sugar did very little to enhance the flavor.\n\nThe whipped cream custard, so proudly advertised as having lots of vanilla beans in it, was similarly lacking. The taste of the custard was not too sweet and tasted more like sweet cream with the body of a very light custard. I found it much \"flatter\" than I normally like my cream puffs. I found very few vanilla beans but moreover, I couldn't taste them at all. The green tea puffs had a much more pronounced flavor in the custard.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- the cream puffs are good and there are certainly MUCH worse cream puffs to be had in the Bay Area. But don't believe the hype. These cream puffs are NOT godlike and they certainly are NOT worth a special trip into the city.", "author": "Michelle N."}

I'm on my way to the Ritz Carlton to pick up a client who was heading back.  My car is just for their luggage.  The clients were sitting in another car.   So I'm driving past Mission and Third going up to Stockton and think to myself:\n\nSelf:  Man I should have factored in some time so that I could grab some of those Cream Puffs I've heard so much about.  \n\nI get up to the Ritz and put in a phone call notifing the proper people that I'm in the area, and they've just started eating breakfast and that they would be ready in about 30-45 minutes.  Now, I had a decision to make..  Breakfast at the Ritz, or Cream Puffs.    Seeing that I wasn't in proper \"Dining Room @ Ritz Carlton\" attire, I decided to rush down to Yueba Buena to grab some puffs.     \n\nWanted to park at the Jessie Street Garage (underneath the Four Seasons) but decided itwas too expensive so backed out of the garage and headed over to the Fifth and MIssion garage.   \n\nParked the car on the 2nd floor next to the stairs and ran down the stairs, across the street to Beard Papas and there wasn't even a line.   I was amazed at all the employees needed for those 6 puffs.    This job of filling the custard with creamy goodness could be done by one person.  \n\nI ended up buying 6, since it came with a nice carrying case, plus I could eat more than 1, ran back to my car, paid the $2.50 for parking 10 minutes and make it just in time to pick up the luggage.  \n\nCream puffs were delicious and definately warrants a return visit.", "author": "Herb C."}

These cream puffs are DELICIOUS!!! As I was heading towards Union square for some shopping, I walked right past the shop and noticed that the line wasn't long at all! I immediately walked in and stood in a line that lasted maybe 2 minutes. As I was waiting, the aroma of buttery puff pastry put me in a trance dreaming about my first bite. I decided to go with the vanilla bean cream puff. The pastry was so crispy on the outside and perfectly soft in the inside. So light and good. The vanilla cream was yummy, not to creamy and more custard like. I'm not a huge fan of cream puffs, but these were heavenly. \n\nI'm definitely going back to try the chocolate and their weekly specials.

On top of that, you can add fruit and chocolate to the puff. I'm drooling as I type at the thought of one.\n\nUnfortunately Beard Papa doesn't come close to my Puff & Pao experience. I felt the puff was a bit too crusty for me, and it was a little too delicate and didn't have any structure to it.

It's just a half block away. Which is a bad, bad thing.\r\n\r\nThese cream puffs are fantastic! The vanilla bean custard is not too sweet and the texture is just heavenly. The choux is nicely crispy on the outside. I love that these are made to order. \r\n\r\nThere's not much of a selection right now. Just vanilla cream puffs.

It was good as desserts go but in comparison to the vanilla cream puff? Not good. The chocolate filling was gritty and the batch of cream puffs that mine was from were very misshapen and, in my opinion, should not have been used and just tossed. Aren't choux supposed to be a roundish shape? The one I had was lumpy. Maybe I should try another 2 to see if it has improved but for now the vanilla was hands down much better.\r\n\r\n*****I've now also had the green tea flavored puff. Let's just say that's going to be the only time I try it. The thing about green tea is that it's fairly subtle flavor. The custard was so rich that I didn't really detect the green tea until after I was finished. Which if you didn't know what you were eating you would just think that the taste was off. Also?

I had checked Beard Papa's website a couple months ago to see if they were ever coming to SF after I had a heavenly taste of their cream puffs in Hollywood.

Not too sweet, wonderful vanilla flavor in the sublimely textured cream, and a crispy-crunchy shell. MMMMMMMMMMMM!!! Apparently yesterday Beard Papa sold more cream puffs than any other California Beard Papa did on their first day. Good job San Francisco!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-06-02", "description": "New here to yelp and still thinking of something witty for my profile. \"\r\n\r\nFirst of all just want to say...yes I am addicted to Beard Papa Cream Puffs hehe.  I've enjoyed BP in Japan, Singapore, Hollywood, Gardena, and now here in the Bay Area.  My opinion is purely my opinion and everyone is entitled to their own.  I'm just here to educate and answer questions raised on previous reviews.\r\n\r\nFYI...this is a long post and yes I have too much time on my hands =).  I base all my info on a 15min chat session with the manager of the Yerba Buena store and my personal experiences.\r\n\r\n1) Japanese vs French Puffs\r\nKeep in mind this is a Japanese style cream puff.  Hence the crispy shell, softer dough inside, and semi-sweet japanese Nama custard (custard and whipped cream).  I believe this is what makes the taste and texture unique.  French style puffs are softer and have a heavier, sweeter cream.  See #2 below for puff size differences.\r\n\r\n2) Napkins required?\r\nFirst of all, these puffs are big and a good amount of japanese style custard cream is purposely injected into the crispy shells.  Thus the flaky shell, amt of cream, and dusted baker's sugar leads to quite a mess.  If you saw the CNN Anderson Cooper piece on BP, the messy eating experience was one of the funny things they mentioned.  **WARNING...my opinion here** I personally feel you get quality and quantity in this pastry.  Because of the larger size puff and extra room for cream, I feel like I'm getting my money's worth and don't experience the sugar sickness afterwards because of the lighter, semi-sweet custard.  I couldn't consume french style cream in equal amounts...hmm now that I think of it maybe that's why French cream puffs are smaller. \r\n\r\n3) Pricey?\r\nSome may think $1.75 for a cream puff is expensive, but personally for me and my taste...I'd rather pay for a fresh, larger-than-norm BP puff than $3 for a Satura Cream Puff (decent, but not flaky...more bread like), $1.50 for a Ranch 99 Cream Puff, or $2+ for a behind-the-glass muffin/scone/danish at my local Starbucks.  But a BP puff does go perfectly with Starbuck's dark roast.\r\n\r\n4) Are they really fresh?\r\nShells are baked every 20mins and custard made every 2-3hours.  The puffs are never served hot or piping from the oven.  They need to be cooled out of the oven to get that flaky texture.  If the shells are not cooled properly or if the custard is pumped in too soon...moisture will soften the shells prematurely.  \r\n\r\n5) Why the lines?\r\nGoing back to #4 above, the lines primarily form when patrons are left waiting for the ovens to finish baking or when the puff are still in the cooling process.  Plus add in the marketing factor here.\r\n\r\n6) What's up with all the workers?\r\nEvery BP I've visited has had a Cream Puff line of workers so its part of the experience whether you like it or not.  Keep in mind, if they had fewer workers things might move slower.  But there is a difference between BP bakeries ambiance...I'll explain.  Have your ever been to a sushi restaurant where they greet you loudly in Japanese, proceed to shout orders, bow to you while saying Domo (sp?).  Well some BP's have this same experience where they greet/shout in Japanese which makes it more \"entertaining\"...purely my opinion here.  The Yerba Buena store is bland in this sense, but at least the workers are nice and courteous.    \r\n\r\n7) Other locations?\r\nThere are two more to be open this year...Redwood City and the SF Center a block away.  Is it just me or are the two SF stores a bit close?  Why not spread them out?  In any case, living in the Peninsula myself...I'll be a regular in the Redwood City spot.  After doing a bit of research with the Yerba Buena baker, the Redwood City BP will be bigger, have more coffee house style seating, and have a barista.\r\n\r\n8) Why only vanilla?  Where's the fondant and cheesecake fingers?\r\nThe manager I spoke to didn't really have a good answer here, but at least they finally started serving chocolate puffs this week.  As for the fondant and cheesecake fingers...good news is that  they also are baked fresh daily, bad news is that they don't start selling these sweets until a month after grand opening...bah! \r\n\r\n9) Who is Beard Papa?\r\nWell its kind of an entertaining story...I suggest you walk in and ask one of the workers.\r\n\r\nSorry for the Beard Papa thesis, hopefully you'll enjoy them as much as I do!", "author": "Alexa M."}

The surprising thing is that Beard Papa's makes excellent coffee, making it a great place to stop in for breakfast on your way to work.

This is the second time I've been to this location and it still amazes me how the Beard Papa employees turn out these little cream puffs and cakes as fast as one of Willy Wonkas assembly line oompa loompas. I hope that's not un PC to say, woops. \nThey have the expected flavors such as strawberry, chocolate, and vanilla. But for the slightly more adventurous they also have Green Tea and Coffee. With the first Beard Papa's locations opening in Japan in 1999, this chain seems to be catching on pretty quickly in the U.S. Us Americans do like us some sugar and fried goodness! And since Krispy Kreme is pretty much non-existent in the SF (except for the stale versions in Safeway), I think Beard Papa's will be a success.  And if you complain about enhaling the powdered sugar then you deserve to be eating a stale doughnut instead.\n \nOh and their slogan is \"fresh and natural\". How can you go wrong?

I must've been really hungry because I took one whiff of Beard Papa's when I walked in and made an impluse purchase of a dozen puffs.  I'm such an easy sell.

Imagine that, a place where people line up to pay you money!  These cream puffs are quite extraordinary.  While I am not usually a fan of pastry, these guys know what they're doing.  I'm a little disappointed that the pat a choix is not made fresh but is pre-shaped and frozen so the workers simply put them on baking sheets.  However, the taste is unparalleled by any pastry shop I've visited.  The puff itself has a nice outer crunch and the inside is feathery light and moist.  The cream (I've tried the vanilla, chocolate, and green tea) has a perfect balance of creaminess, mouthfeel, sweetness, flavor, and body to make this delectable treat a success.  I highly recommend the vanilla flavor, no gimmicks, no fancy extras, just plain old pat a choix and vanilla cream...my mouth is watering...yum!", "author": "Brian A."}

If there was eyecandy then I wouldnt mind but there isnt any.\n\nThe cream puffs are good, but not something I would arrange my schedule arround.  As with some other reviewers I expected them to be a bit warm, I can understand how that doesnt really work though, but breathing in all the butter while waiting in line somehow makes you expect that the puffs are warm.  The crust was good, but it seemed that the crunchy part was more due to some sugary substance kinda like those mass produce belgian waffles you can get at supermarkets.  The rest of the crunchy parts was more general pastry crunch, nothing special like croissant crunch or flaky egg tart crunch.  The custard was good.  I was surprised after watching the video (several times while waiting) that the custard and puff didnt taste oily/greasy with all the butter that they put in there.  I like that it isnt too sweet and that the vanilla is not overpowering.  Custard was well mixed.  Their operations process seems stupid (especially for a franchise) and the layout of the place sucks.  Summary: worth going to and worth bringing tourists too if you are in the area, but not worth a special trip.  Overhyped.", "author": "H C."}

I believe that cream puffs and traditional french bakeries or even from the frozen aisle could be comparable.    I thought with the warm smell, I'd get a slightly warmer puff, but it was cold. Also, there is barely any crust (just a thin layer)! I prefer a more airy dough crust with some air pockets. Also the vanilla filling was ample and I saw vanilla flecks (so kudos for using real vanilla beans).  However, the cream took over the whole puff and though light in flavor, was too much for me.  I think for me, I prefer the original krispy kreme doughnut, rather than the new  \"krispy kreme\" cream puff.  Also, a con with this location is parking.

Fortunately my experience included all of the former and none of the latter. I found it amusing that it took 4 people to get my puffs in order. One to take the order, 1 to fill the puff with vanilla cream, 1 to dust puff with sugar and put into little bag, and 1 to put 4 puffs in a box and that box in a bag - it's not like they are building a car here. Ordering is easy now as the menu is mostly littered with \"Coming Soon\" signs and you can only get the vanilla cream. I eagerly await the other creams, the cheesecake fingers, and chocolate fondants though I can't imagine how all these offerings might put a crimp in the assembly line and result in a comical I Love Lucy sketch. I picked up my puffs at 11am and there was no wait. With the patience of a samurai I did not sample a puff until 10pm and it was quite good. The filling was flecked with real vanilla bean or possibly stuff they swept off the floor - either way it tasted great. \nOne question remained - who is this Beard Papa? He looks like the fisherman from the Simpson's who runs the all you can eat shack.

The San Francisco store on the new Yerba Buena Lane is one of a few U.S. franchises; the others are in New York, New Jersey, Boston, Hawaii and Los Angeles. \n\nAfter we'd waited for about 10 minutes, one of the staff came down the line, apologized, and told us it would be 30 minutes before another batch was ready. Because we were only ordering one, we decided to stay, in hopes it would be quicker. \n\nBeard Papa is quite the scene. Besides the long line winding out the door, there's a lot going on inside. When you first step over the threshold, you're hit with this delicious buttery scent. You can see the puffs baking in these industrial-looking, high-tech ovens. They start off the size of a hockey puck, and then rise into a much larger, 3-inch puff. The staff, dressed chef's whites, forms an assembly line when the puffs are done cooling, with one person injecting the custard into the puff, the second dusting it with powdered sugar and placing it in a bag, and the third packing them into carrying boxes.\n\nThis place inspires some kind of weird fanaticism, and after having a vanilla cream puff, I have to say it may be merited. The people in line were mostly all Asian, as were all of the staff. A family with four little boys was taking pictures with one of the staff. Overhead, on two flat screen TVs, news clips about Beard Papa played; at one point, I looked up and saw Anderson Cooper on CNN eating a cream puff. The store sells T-shirts with its mascot --- an old, bearded man in a cap, and the saying, \"Who's Your Papa?\" This is probably temporary, but there was a sign saying \"Limit: One dozen per customer.\" \n\nThe menu over the cream puff area had \"Coming Soon\" taped over all of the selections, except the vanilla cream puffs. Under coming soon: cream puffs of different flavors --- chocolate, caramel, green tea, pumpkin, milk tea and strawberry. With the exception of chocolate, the flavors will rotate on a weekly basis. There are also the curiously named cheesecake sticks, the fondant au chocolat and clairs. \n\nThe puff itself is a marvel of choux pastry: flaky, buttery, and crunchy. The cream is also unique, and delicious. It is a not-too-sweet mixture of whipped cream and custard that the sign in Beard Papa's claims it takes two hours to make. You can see them scraping the vanilla bean pods, too, to extract the vanilla that flecks the cream in the vanilla cream puffs. I think this may be a new obsession for me.", "author": "Deb K."}

But don't worry, while you wait you can watch their advertising/ propoganda/ how-to video over and over again!  Apparently they have two layers of dough in their cream puffs - an inner layer of regular Choux dough, and an outer layer of donut-like dough.  That's where it all went wrong for me.  I enjoyed their fillings, particularly the vanilla filling (with fresh vanilla beans), but the cream puff is too hard, crunchy and dry.  I was expecting something lighter.

I waited until I got home to eat it, and for the love of me, I passed out from a sugar induced coma. Long story short: It was GOOD. Tasty, and the filling inside ... I can't describe it. It had a nice texture, went down smooth. Service was okay ... for maybe two minutes, the way they were talking to each other made it seem like they didn't know what an eclair was.

Because when I used to live in NYC, I was obsessed with the cream puffs here and got every single relative who visited me obsessed with them as well.  When I read that Beard Papa was going to open in San Francisco, I emailed everyone I knew in San Francisco to let them know about the opening day.\n\nSo after moving back here, I was even more excited about Beard Papa being here because it was a little bit of NYC right here in SF and it would remind me of my life there.  Sadly though, the cream puffs here just don't quite measure up to the ones from NYC.  I even tried them out three times before writing this review just to make sure I wasn't getting it wrong.\n\nSo what's the difference?  Well, it is the same chain and presumably the same recipe for both the pastry and the custard.  But its just a little off.  The pastry seems a little crunchier than what I remember and the custard not as smooth.  I also notices that all three times I have been to the SF location, the cream puffs have been pre-made.  As in all dressed up with powdered sugar and already in their paper packages.  I'm not sure if that's for convenience's sake (although there's never been more than a few people in line everytime I go) or what, but it seems that the cream gets absorbed into the pastry and things soften up a bit too much in the center and bottom.  The operating procedure in NYC was that the sweet Japanese ladies making the cream puffs wouldn't make what you ordered until you ordered it, which preserves the freshness (and this was even if there was 10 people in line).  Obviously, this doesn't make much of a difference if you're bringing a bunch home, but I always ate mine fresh off the assembly line.\n\nI'm also a little disappointed that the franchise owners decided to put both locations so close to each other rather than spreading them out throughout the city.  The service here is a bit spotty as well - one time, the young male cashier was too busy ogling a well-endowed female customer to pay attention to my order.  I had to repeat myself twice before he deigned to look in my direction and even with me giving him the stink eye, he continued to laugh and joke about this customer with the other male workers.      \n\nDespite this, I'd still eat Beard Papa's because of the nostalgic factor and because it is still a pretty darn good cream puff.

But, talk about great marketing... and that custard aroma that wafts out of the cafe... enticing!\nI used to eat Beard Papa's often when I was working in Asia (they're a lot cheaper there) and was thankfully a luxury I could afford but now that they've been translated into American dollars with the American price sting, I've reduced my love for Beard Papa's by a star (tear). But, when I'm in the city I 80% of the time make a stop here for two reasons: one, the menu has expanded and they have a \"special\" daily flavor, my favorite so far being pumpkin; two, it just smells soooo good and I always feel like I should be rewarded for my small life efforts so I'll dish out for one or two pastries. I'll buy more if I'm visiting family because they're absolute die hard fans of the original vanilla Beard Papa's cream puffs. Beyond the cream puffs and the eclairs (which are actually just the cream puffs dipped in chocolate) I haven't tried their other new offerings, but am planning on going back sometime to try cheesecake and fondant au chocolat. I hear they have mochi ice cream, but haven't seen/heard anything about them yet.\nI have to say the 2 greatest selling point of Beard Papa's is that they use custard instead of cream, and it is definitely fresh. If you're willing to spend extra for sweets, Beard Papa would be your thing.", "author": "Jessica L."}

This would not have been the second time that a pastry has caused such a panic in the world. Four years ago, a Krispy Kreme opened up in suburban Milwaukee drawing thousands to the small parking lot. Police were called in to direct traffic and news choppers hovered over the newly constructed store to snap photos of all the hype. Kenny Rogers, in town for a concert, showed up to pledge his love for the donut. Which leads me to exclaim that after eating my first Beard Papa, I had to think that the tasty treat was not the best cream puff I ever had. Krispy Kreme may have made Milwaukeeans look like a bunch of hype-driven consumers, but Wisconsin does lay claim to one title, even a chain store cannot topple; best cream puff in the World. Each year during the Wisconsin State Fair, nearly 360,000 puffs are sold, an average of 57 per minute. They have been crafting this treat for nearly 85 years and it is hard to beat. The combination is two eclair-like shells filled with a whopping amount of sweet cream, NOT eclair custard like at Beard Papa's. My Papa cream puff was good, but it felt more like an eclair to me and in my tainted world of dairy and cows, you just don't mess with the undisputed champion of cream puffs. From now on Beard Papa's only sells eclairs to me.", "author": "Taylor P."}

I thought the cream puffs were excellent.  Now, I should preface my comments with the fact that I generally do NOT like cream puffs and that I probably will not go back to Beard Papa's any time soon (since I do not like cream puffs).  But, if perchance I ever find that I am in the mood for cream puffs, I definitely will go back to Beard Papa's.  Although the cream puffs are a little pricey, they are (in my opinion) worth it.  Typically, cream puffs are refrigerated, which makes the outer bread casing cold and mushy.  What is more, cream puffs that have been pre-made are oftentimes are soggy since the cream has been languishing in the bread casings for a long time.  At Beard Papa's, they do not actually fill the cream puff until you order it.  (Quite literally, empty bread casings sit in a bin next to cream-dispensing machines.  When you order a cream puff, a worker takes an empty bread casing and then fills it.)  This ensures that, when you eat your cream puff, the bread casing will not be soggy.  As for the cream, it is phenomenal.  It is sweet, but not too sweet (I'm partial to desserts that are not too sweet), and it has a smooth, creamy texture.  Although I generally do not care for cream puffs, I'd have to say that this place serves the best of 'em.", "author": "Sophrosyne Y."}

We thought about bringing some back to the mainland but didn't think it would survive (we'd either kill 'em before we left the hotel, or they'd rot on the 5 hour trip unrefrigerated, more than likely the former). Since they opened one up here in SF I was kinda excited to get my hands on these tasty treats. I am proud to say that I've only been there one time though. I really enjoy popping these suckers in my mouth, but it's really not good for me (gotta watch my food intake in my old age) so I try my best to avoid it.

He made an appointment in my outlook calendar for us to go try this place and I said to myself, this has GOTS to be good stuff.  Hmmm...not so much.  When we went, there was only one option:  regular cream puff.  Everything else was labeled coming soon!   Ok, fine, they're just starting off.  Bring on the puff.  The dough was cooked to be light and airy and non-greasy which was nice, but I can't say it really tasted like anything?  Maybe some more sugar?  The cream filling was also lacking in flavor, there was too much of it, and it was really cold.  I would have preferred my puff to be warm and if not warm, at least room temperature.  Other people in the office raved and raved over the puffs but I really can't say that I'm a fan.", "author": "LaSha G."}

Chocolate and Vanilla Bean are my favorite, but there are daily flavors like Strawberry, Green Tea and Pumpkin.  They are a little expensive as a box of a dozen Cream Puffs are 22$.  They are a little over 2$ each.  Unfortunately I don't like their cheesecake sticks, which are pretty bland.  Their eclairs and chocolate cakes are ok, but the real stars are the cream puffs.  The coffee here is pretty good, the iced coffee is better.  The lines can be a little long here, so prepare to be patient.  The store is always immaculately clean.  There isn't much seating inside the store, but fortunately there's Yerba Buena Park across the street, and seating nearby infront of the Jewish Museum.  Of course outside there's plenty of pan handling to avoid and anyone sitting down enjoying a pastry is seen as an easy target.", "author": "Michael D."}

The smell of this place drew me in and has had me since then. I've tried their daily special cream puffs, but the original and chocolate cream puffs are still the best. To top things off, I'd definitely go with an eclair if I'm in the mood to indulge (which I always do). The eclair is basically a cream puff covered with chocolate. Must I say, this is DELICIOUS. The cheese sticks aren't too impressive, but still not bad if you're in the mood (but then I'd just go to the cheesecake factory which is just a couple blocks away). The chocolate lava cake is absolutely SCRUMPTIOUS. They would ask you if you want to eat it right away, or would like to bring it home. If you'd like to eat it right away, they would pop it into the microwave for 10 seconds and when you dive into the cake, the warm molten chocolate center oozes out in all its goodness. It's just the perfect ending to a great meal or a night in the city.", "author": "Fanny C."}

Rather like them quite a lot.  They're not like anything I've had before (certainly not like those azuki-filled eclairs I loathe), which is, in this case, a good thing.  It's also a good thing they're what I'd call a health food.", "author": "Hannah J."}

I personally like the regular cream puff better than the chocolate cream, yet I don't deny licking the paper clean after both of their consumptions. If you aren't down with finding cream on your face an hour later, then you can use the forks and knives to cut them up. (You'll be missing out on all the fun though!)", "author": "Tami H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-08", "description": "ok, admittedly, the hype drew me in and i stopped by this place on my way from the MOMA. the vanilla pastries coupled with a cold handle of milk totally put in the mood. the cheesesticks were also good (the BFF did not like), but my question is: what the hell is up with always being out of strawberry?? i've tried the seasonals more than the strawberry, and for anyone who knows me, all ends right at that red berry. beard papa seriously gets one star off for not having it every time i go.", "author": "Jenz y."}

I heard about it from a friend who's been to Japan, which is where they are famous. All I have to say is that I loved it, but you have to eat it right away or it doesn't taste as good. Only thing was, that it wasn't hot. I think it would taste even better if they gave it to you at least warm.", "author": "Connie W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-13", "description": "Yummy yummy cream puffs. The pastry was just delightful and the filling was not overpowering. The major down side to the visit was the wait. But watching the workers actually fill cream puffs and powdering them with sugar helps pass the time.", "author": "Tara C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-04", "description": "i'd like to share my experience along with the other 190 reviews here, not that's it's a fascinating experience at all.  i was walking over to a friend's place when i saw all the fun blue and yellow balloons out front.  i thought it was some kind of cal thing.  hah.  anyway, it turned out to be the very second day of opening for this place.  recognizing the fisherman guy logo and seizing the opportunity that there were hardly any people in line, i bought one dozen puffs on the spot.  i waited maybe 10 minutes tops.  the longest part was them actually filling the puffs, since no one else was buying a dozen.  i still have the cute box.  it was the vanilla flavored cream... and oh so good.  i must've ate one a day for the next four days (i like moderation).  i think the sweetness is just right, not too sweet and very delicate.  maybe even a tad too much filling cuz it just oozes in the middle.  even the crust has a nice amount of chew.  doesn't really last more than three days though.  later i tried the chocolate, but i like the vanilla better.  i have yet to try the other flavors.  i'd never wait 45 minutes for this place like my other crazy friends.", "author": "Em C."}
