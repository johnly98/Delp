It ended up being one of my top omakase experiences in SF!\n\nWe were served by chef Alex, who was extremely knowledgeable about each cut of fish (including, but not limited to, origins/history, why the texture of the fish is the way it is, and fun facts). It was complete package: dinner and a course in everything related to sushi.\n\nI even took some notes:\n- The island of Shikoku has large waves, so the fish from this area do not have any fat (since they need to swim/work harder against the waves).\n- Salmon from the ocean has more fat, whereas trout from the river has more flavor.\n- Baby fish is more delicate and has less flavor.\n- Traditional Edomae style sushi from the 16th-18th century used cured fish and no garnishes.\n\nWill be back for another sushi lesson soon!", "author": "Jennifer K."}

The chefs were deliberate in their movement, and their work was choreographed, essentially. The servers were that rare combination of attentive and almost invisible. No one was trying to be plucky or cute, just hustling to make your experience a good one. Very good sake and wine pairings.\n\nNow the reason this review is only for 3 stars is the food, which was surprisingly-mediocre for the price tag. Ijjji goes a long way on supposedly serving authentic Japanese, but most of our tasting menu ate bland and boring-textured. The exceptions were the green soybean cake in bonito broth, which had an elevated matzo ball soup -vibe, and their seaweed with grapes & vinegar mozuku. The other dishes could use more acid and crunch -- there was way too much unctuous umami, and not enough sharpness & contrast.\n\nTheir fish sourcing is clearly top notch, but some combination of handling, aging, cutting, or saucing left the fish boring. For a place that prides itself on sushi, we should not come away liking their vegetarian dishes the most. Their tamago & shrimp tasted freezer-burned. We could not finish the miso ice cream, which was just a sugar bomb. I wonder if they are over-reaching?", "author": "Ben G."}

First of all the front of this business doesn't make it obvious that it's a nice sushi joint--look for the blue cloth hanging over the entrance. Secondly, the small/intimate dining room makes the experience feel higher quality (extreme opposite of a churn and burn AYCE sushi buffet). Thirdly and most importantly, the food is amazing. There's no need to go into detail about the food when you know it's going to be good and you just need to let the magic occur. With utter certainty, everything you put into your mouth here is worth a million bucks. Feast your eyes on the pictures I posted and don't worry, those goosebumps will go away in about 5 minutes.\n\nMy personal omokase restaurant pro-tips (in general, not just here at Ijji):\n1) Try to book early enough to get a seat at the bar to enjoy the chefs in their element creating edible art.\n2) My wife always laughs at me for this, but close your eyes after putting the nigiri in your mouth. Focus on the flavors and let it melt away on your taste buds. Seriously, I know you might think it's awkward but you're not just paying for some fish and rice, you're here for a delicious handcrafted morsel with lots of energy put into it so pay it some respect and focus all your tasting concentration back on it!\n3) In my honest opinion there's no need for ever doing the alcohol pairing--just enjoy the fish and get some drinks before or after!", "author": "Marlon T."}

At ijji, this is NOT the case. there is a perfect balance of flavors. \n\ngreat place for a nice evening for getting to know people. not cheap, but worth every penny. you're paying almost double other omakase's but really really worth it", "author": "Jonathan Q."}

Once we found out via Yelp that it's an omakase place, we had to add it to our list. She made the reservation for us almost a month in advance, and off we went. \n\nWe sat at the bar with two other foodie couples, one sushi chef per couple. As the meal progressed, it kinda turned into a party even though we were strangers. I highly recommend requesting bar seating if you want to mingle with other patrons and interact with the chef. Our chef was a little shy but super nice and shared a lot of interesting tidbits about each type of fish and the preparation method as he went along. \n\nOur chef prepared and placed each course in front of us one by one, for a total of 23 items (5 appetizers, 12 nigiri pieces, a palate cleanser, a small bite, miso soup, and finally dessert). Everything was so delicious but a few of the standouts for me were the appetizers, uni (a mixture from Hokkaido and Santa Barbara which is the best uni I've ever had), and the o-toro (the fattiest and most buttery fatty tuna I've ever had), and the housemade yuzu ice cream. My only complaint about the ice cream is that there wasn't enough of it. Towards the end of the meal, we received a menu of their supplements which you can decline if you're full. We opted for additional pieces of o-toro because it was just that good. \n\nFor what it's worth, my girlfriend was born in Japan and spent the first 12 years of her life there, and she gives Ijji a solid A.

Ijji's style is more along the lines of wako, Ju-ni, and sushi hon... the type that has some marinades and smoked meats but still very focused on the flavor of the fish. I think they have great execution and I remember loving the place a lot. The amount of food is just enough to be full... probably could get a couple of extra pieces to be fully satisfied.

After a superb dinner here, I see myself returning.\n\nThe service and hushed miniature spa-retreat vibe of this spot put me in the mind of a smaller Benu: warm and attentive service rendered in a private, soothing wood-set hideout.\n\nThe 1st piece of kinmedai with grilled snapper scales immediately awed us into attention. What follows is an impressive cascade of Japanese premium fish marinated, grilled, and zested beyond many competitor's subtly and finesse. It felt, again, more like Benu than any super traditional sushi place, but it's unmistakably Modern Asian and Michelin-grade San Franciscan high cuisine (rather than the gaudy cheeseball \"fusion\" of Nobu in Vegas / Sushi of Gari in NYC). Unlike the westernized Pabu/Sushi Ran/Ichi+Ni, it felt unmistakeable 2017 -- it assumes you already know what's authentic, and then it very slightly modifies that.\n\nSome standouts: kinmedai, marinated chu-toro, firefly squid, striped bass with yuzu seaweed (holy heck!), and anago.\n\nI'll admit, the freshness of 1/3 of the fish is maybe A+ instead of A+++ as you'd demand for the price (we came on the 8:30 shift on Sunday, possibly the least flattering day for sushi shops), but every piece of nigiri was so lovingly marinated, scorched, and zested with Japanese herbs that we had a hard time picking fault.\n\nKudos to Ijji for achieving a modern perfection without sacrificing authenticity and subtly.

The man was trying to persuade him in a nice manner to make him a piece because he flew out from NY but the chef just said \"sorry, it is for tomorrow. No. Sorry.\" I understand where the chef is coming from to the extent that the next day is a Sunday and he needs to reserve fish because the fish market is closed. However, if it was me, I would not hesitate to make one piece for a customer who will leave happy. I guess that didn't happen to us but witnessing that left me a bit of an impression on the customer service at Ijji.\n\n I do recommend going there and trying it out because they do serve very fresh fish from Japan! I also liked that they made sure I get a hot cup of green tea every now and then.", "author": "Natalie C."}

The chef also asked us to recall our favorite courses, so be sure to take notes while you eat!\n\nOne bonus thing that I can rarely say is how impressed I was with the bathroom here, so much so that I want to model my bathroom after it.

It's most reminiscent of our visit to Japan. Each nigiri is perfectly sliced, seasoned, prepared and served. The detail seasoning to the rice and ratio to fish is perfect. It's simplicity of preparation highlights the flavor of each fish. Each sushi is dressed differently and paired to enhance the fish. We commented on how the soy sauce was amazing, full of flavor and not too salty. The chef nonchalantly mentioned that it was made in house. The fish that were cured and aged were also done in house. We offered the sushi chef a glass of wine that we brought with us and he offered us an extra course of clam that was off menu and tasted like abalone. It was a perfect dish. I told him that it was so amazing, he should add it to the omakase. There are much more expensive omakase places that we've compared this to and found this is the best. At $145 per person and $25 corkage, it's a clear winner for me as my new go to Japanese omakase.", "author": "Stephanie K."}

He would then fumble with his chopsticks and end up dropping the nigiri on the table before he could take a bite. He would use his unwashed bare hands to pick it back up, dunk it (what was left intact) into the saucer of soy sauce again, and plop it into his mouth.  \n\nI would look up to see the sushi chef giving us the *DEATH STARE*.\n\nWhen he went to use the restroom, I jokingly whispered to the sushi chef: \"Tinder...\". \n\nThe sushi chef gave the \"ahhhh haaaaa\" look, chuckled, and had the server bring a bottle of sake on the house. \n\n\"Wow, how did you manage to get us free sake?\", my date asked.\n\n\"For being a slob\", I thought. Instead, I smiled and said, \"Kanpai!\" as I toasted our sake glasses.\n\nIf you're like my date, may I suggest Ijji Sushi? \n\nOpening on February 2nd from the owners of Saru, Ijji is a traditional sushi restaurant that serves nigiri only (no rolls) and a handful of appetizer dishes (e.g. ankimo, chawanamushi, asari soup). They don't provide soy sauce or wasabi (each nigiri is brushed with sauce and garnished with accoutrements) so don't have to worry getting death stares from the sushi chef. They provide you with an o-shibori (hot towel) to wash your hands so you can freely eat the nigiri with your hands. I always eat nigiri with my hands now because admittedly, I'm a phuckin' slob as well. Sometimes my hair and boobies ate more than I did. \n\nReservations are highly recommended as it's a very small place. There's 3-4 tables for walk-ins and the sushi bar which seats 7 is reservations only. \n\nMy friend and I made reservations for the sushi bar and opted for the omakase. There's an 8 piece minimum order and each nigiri is charged at market price ($5-$9 per a piece). \n\nO M A K A S E\n*Appetizer - Baby octopus & baby octopus egg, and trumpet mushrooms w/ sesame sauce: http://bit.ly/1QQF1JH\n*Hotate (scallop) Nigiri ($6): http://bit.ly/1Q5c2oK\n*Kanpachi (amberjack) Nigiri ($6): http://bit.ly/20jUFA2\n*Sawara (Spanish mackerel) Nigiri ($5): http://bit.ly/1PKkkjE\n*Tai Kobujime (kelp marinated sea bream) Nigiri ($6): http://bit.ly/1ol8MJz\n*Kamasu (barracuda) Nigiri ($6): http://bit.ly/1NZU3Ze\n*Katsuo (wild bonito) Nigiri ($7): http://bit.ly/1RipBQx\n*Tsuri Aji (wild horse mackerel) Nigiri ($5): http://bit.ly/1SZXDZR\n*Kohada (wild gizzard shad) Nigiri ($6): http://bit.ly/1Q3tGD3\n*Tamago Atsuyaki (Japanese sweet omelet w/ blue shrimp): http://bit.ly/1RisNMb\n\nEverything was really fresh and the shari was properly prepared - held its form and was nicely seasoned with vinegar and sugar. The omakase as a whole was good for the price (w/ 1 beer, add-ons, tax, and 20% tip it was $100 pp) but I wasn't wow'd like Wako, Kusakabe, Akiko, and Yoshizumi. The highlights were the bonito, and tsuri aji, and the sponge cake-like tamago.

My friend had the zuwai kani and really enjoyed it. \n\nThe owner/sushi chef was kind enough to give us an order of the Housemade Matcha Ice Cream w/ azuki beans on the house: http://bit.ly/1PKmTCj.

I was really lucky to be able to get a sushi bar reservation just earlier that afternoon! The entire ambience is very zen and minimalistic, even the entrance is just a large unmarked wooden door. Ijji only seats about 20 people though, so be sure to get a reservation or check ahead of time.\n\nI didn't feel the sushi bar was as worth it here (vs. a table). Service is definitely a bit faster since the chefs just hand you the sushi directly, so that's still a plus. But the chefs don't seem to talk to the customers very much, so, if that's what you're looking for....\n\nThe omakase is less structured than at other sushi places in SF. Rather than listing out the courses that you'll receive (i.e. 2 warm apps, 5 nigiri, and dessert), \"omakase\" is just a single option on the menu, and the chefs decide on the spot which nigiri to give you. \n\nWe actually decided to order a la carte this time. We started with the ankimo and clam miso soup, then moved on to 7 pieces of nigiri each. The ankimo was rich and smooth and came with some seaweed and light soy sauce. I'm not usually a soup person, but the clam miso soup was really delicious. It was served with a few plump, juicy clams on the shell, and the soup itself was a beautiful blend of miso with a bit of seafood-ness.\n\nOn to the nigiri! All of the fish was really fresh, definitely high quality. The sea bream and o-toro (fatty tuna) were two that stood out to me. The chef served the sea bream with a small dot of black sesame on top. The flavor was really interesting; I had never had sesame on my nigiri before. And the o-toro, SO AMAZING!! It was slightly torched, with a brushstroke of soy sauce on top, and just melts in your mouth. We could not resist each ordering a second piece. The uni, however, was a bit disappointing. It wasn't super creamy / sweet and consisted of a few small pieces, rather than one smooth piece, over the over-abundant blob of rice.\n\nHigh quality fish. Clean and simple decor. Overall delicious, but not mind-blowing. I wouldn't object to coming back again though.", "author": "Tiffany P."}

This has allowed for better food costs, better food execution, and more attention to detail. It follows along the same tasting menu Omakase style of other new (last 2 years), popular, and some Michelin Starred Sushi-ya like Wako (1*), Kusakabe (was 1*), Omakase (1*), Maruya (was *1), Ju-Ni (1*) and Sushi Yoshitomi (1*), all of which I have had the pleasure to dine in those 2 years. Hashiri (1*) was recently added to the Michelin list, but I haven't been there yet (it costs twice as much as the rest). \n\nThe entry has no sign, only a small Ijji printed on the hanging blue entry cloths. There are only 15 seats: 7 at the sushi bar, 8 seats behind that in 3 tables. There are 3 sushi chefs. We had the privilege of sitting in the middle of the sushi bar. We  were served by Billy, the master chef, with Michelin starred training in Hong Kong. He knows his stuff, uses an unusually impressive knife set that almost looks like a Samurai short sword for Harakiri, and tastes and personally approves dashi and other accoutrements, and does the main slicing for the Nigiri part of the dinner. \n\nI went on 11/20/16, with my international dining companion, who has a knack for picking out Michelin Starred restaurants before they become one (i.e. Wako, Kusakabe, Omakase, Aster), which is a great money saving and rezzie getting talent! The Omakase menu that evening was in the Edomae style, and included 5 appetizers, 13 Nigiri sushi, and 2 finishing dishes. (see pictures, sorry for the blur, need to upgrade my phone?) I have a picture of the entire menu, and labelled all the pics. \n\nThe per person price was $135, and well worth it. Chef Billy (who is Chinese) personally prepared the sushi for the 2 of us, announced each, as did his other chefs on either side of him, both Japanese, 1 originally from Kyoto, the other from Tokyo. We ordered a wonderful Junmai Dai Ginjo Sake from Akita-ken, called Chokaisan (after Chokai Yama, volcano mountain on Honshu), a Gold Medal award winning sake with a fragrant floral nose and a great smooth taste that improved through the meal ($99).  \n\nI really like the intimate feel this place has, with a nicely paced meal of 20 courses, and the professional staff with a great appreciated and understanding of Sushi. And sitting at the bar offers the classic Sushi Chef-Diner intimacy that really makes it feel like Japan. I suspect that with their Omakase only approach they are now employing, and the high quality if maintained, may earn them a Michelin Star next October. But let me ask my international dining companion!\n\nGo now before that happens, before the prices go up and the rezzies go down.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

This place does that, but at an affordable rate.\n\nWe were able to make the reservation for a Friday night a couple days in advance on OpenTable. Do make sure to specify if you want a table or the bar - I saw some guests disappointed when they didn't get what they wanted.\n\nI find it hilarious that the omakase isn't a set course menu you can follow like most places. You basically get whatever the chefs feel like that day. Not knowing the price might be a little daunting, but with maybe 12 pieces and an opening app, it sat around $70 each for my group.\n\nI really liked our opening bites. The diced octopus included an octopus egg that felt like I was eating a giant lobster egg from Chinese restaurants. And the julienned mushrooms in sesame sauce - so simple yet a great start.\n\nIt's pretty hard for one of these places to have the best of every fish - the chances of the fish market favoring one store is just so unlikely. But overall everything meets the bar you'd expect from these places. My party universally loved the Satsuma beef, and I think the uni beat all three options I received from Kusakabe. After that is where opinions began to differ.\n\nI will say this is one of the times I've noticed the nigiri not being universally prepped. A lot of the places I've been to have a great rice, soy sauce, and wasabi, but other than the fish on top they were all the same. Ijji actually changed how they used all these ingredients depending on the fish, which I really appreciated and kept the experience fresh.\n\nYou can never go wrong with more great sushi, and the Divisadero just got another strong contender.

If you're thinking of dining at Ijji, first prepare yourself for the cost (the reason I deducted one star).....think of what you are used to spending at a 'typical' sushi restaurant, now double that.  What you get in return:  high quality ingredients, great sushi, attentive service, and a beautiful, minimalist setting.  \n\nNote that Ijji is very small (approx. 4 tables for 2-4 people and seven bar seats), so you'll need to arrive early/late or make a reservation on busy nights.  I was told that the sushi bar was originally for walk-in's only, though many people make reservations specifically for the bar - and why not, it's gorgeous.  \n\nWe chose to order nigiri sushi individually so that we could make a selection of typical favorites ourselves.  The highlight was the Sakura Masu (Cherry Salmon) and the Anago Shirani (saltwater eel) - both amongst the best I've every had.  The Zuwai Kani (wild snow crab with crab butter) was the only low-light and this was because it was almost too savory and rich for one 'bite' (and was only compounded by starting with the crab appetizer.)  Regardless of the fish, the rice is how I typically judge sushi restaurants, and the rice at Ijji will blow your socks off - warm, slightly sweet, and fluffy, you keep thinking it's going to fall apart before it gets to your mouth, but it never does.\n\nOverall, besides the price, it's truly hard to fault Ijji - and when you think about it, a dinner here is much cheaper than traveling to Japan for what may be a similar experience.

I've lived in Japan for years this is not exactly traditional. The word \"ChiChai\" comes to mind.\n\n- The fish that did arrive wasn't mind blowing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-10", "description": "Wow! This is the place to get your omakase sushi cherry popped! My friend wanted \"fancy sushi' for his birthday dinner so off to Yelp I went in search of the best.  I naturally came upon this place as it is one of the higher rated omakase places in SF that didn't require you to book months in advance (I booked about a week/few days in advance and there was still plenty of seats left).  It was a prix fixed menu for $135 per person and they called me the day before to ask about any food allergies we might have (now that's when you know you're in for a great meal!).  The location was pretty random, about a 30 minute walk from 16th Mission Bart or like a $5 Uber and definitely bus-able.  When we arrived, we were seated at one of the three tables and offered the drink menu.  The host was very gracious and attentive to our needs.  The ambience was very nice, not super well-lit, but also lit enough to offer a romantic setting.  Me and the bf knew nothing about sake but knew we should try it so we ordered a bottle that sounded fruity and was recommended by the host.  It tasted like alcoholic bananas and it was delicious! When the time came for the dinner to start, we were moved to the sushi bar where we had our own nigiri chef! There were only 5 other people in the restaurant for this sitting so every pair basically had their own chef (3 in total).  \n\nNow for the food:\nThe appetizers were delicious.  My favorite being the octopus since it had just the right amount of flavor.  I was hesitant to try the abalone with liver sauce because it sounded gross but it was actually pretty good! I think my least favorite appetizer was the silky seaweed with vinegar.  It was to cleanse our palette before we got into the nigiri but it was way too vinegar-y for our taste.  \n\nThen it was off to nigiri land!\nWe tried a total of 15 different types of fish (14 for the omakase + 1 additional).  The traditional way of eating nigiri is to eat it with your hands so they provided us with finger sponges that had soap in them so we could wash our fingers after every nigiri! We watched as each nigiri was hand made with precision and TLC.  One by one, we were filled up with deliciousness.  By the 5th one, I actually started getting full, but I kept going because I couldn't stop my mouth from watering at all the fish.  My favorite nigiri was the O-toro, premium blue-fin tuna.  The skin was slightly crispy and it had the best fish flavor my mouth has ever tasted.  I definitely had a foodgasm.  As each nigiri was being made, the chef would explain what it was and a little about each fish.  My least favorite was the sea urchin since the texture of it was not what I was used to for sushi.  The seaweed that they used was the perfect crisp, none of that soggy crap you get at other sushi restaurants.  The most interesting one I thought was the tamago atsuyaki since they put blue shrimp in it, it wasn't your typical tamago nigiri.  The chef explained how usually it takes 30 minutes to make normal tamago but for this one, it took them 4 hours to get the perfect mixture. \n\nTo finish off the meal, we got red miso soup with manila clams in it.  Pretty good to me.  And for dessert, we got green tea ice cream with red bean on top.  Standard.\n\nOverall, the experience was definitely amazing.  The service was over the top and the fish was super authentic and fresh.  I would highly recommend to all my friends looking to pop their omakase cherry!\n\nPS if you go to the bathroom, you will come back to your napkin neatly folded on the table.  It is amazing.  Also, the bathrooms are super clean!", "author": "Cynthia L."}

There was an extensive list of variety of fish and the staff were all extremely nice and friendly. \n\nThe fish were all delicious and you can tell everything was high quality. I loved the simplicity of the decor inside. It's not a big place, it's not trying to mass produce and move people in and out.

My friend and I booked reservations online and came early to avoid the crowds. Both of us have tried out most of the higher end sushi restaurants in the area and found this place to be a solid choice. Toro, wagyu, Uni, etc were all excellent -- as expected from a place like this. This place is inline with traditional sushi and omakese was inline with that idea.\n\nAt the time, I didn't realize this place had the same owner as Saru, and comparing the two, I enjoyed this place much more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-04", "description": "Same people behind Saru, a restaurant I heard good things about but still haven't been to due to it's usual long waits. Ijji is a fancier version and though the restaurant is small, you can make reservations in advance (easily on Opentable too). \n\nFriday night dinner at 7:30pm. Checked in with the host and got seated immediately. Since reservations were made same day, there were no counter seats available even though I made that note when I made the reservation. \n\nWe were introduced to the menu by the waiter who said their omakase offers at least ten pieces of nigiri with a couple 'starters' and he recommends to order a few more starters 'they are kind of like tapas' he said. \n\nFOOD is very well prepared with most dishes either marinated or aged. \nASARI akadashi- red miso based soup with clams. Very earthy! Clams are fairly large, larger than I expected\nSWEET fish- their special item of the day, 5 tiny sweet fishes aged for 2 days, served with kelp. Very tasty and tastes like Chinese sweet preserved fish. \nANKIMO NITSUKE- one of my absolute favorite items of the night, and I DO NOT even like ankimo! I never order it, but husband likes it, so I'll eat it when he orders it. So glad he ordered it bc it's the best ankimo I've ever had. I'd eat ankimo is it tastes like this ever time!\nMARINATED mushrooms- one of the starters that comes with the omakase. Marinated with sesame flavored dressing, good texture\nSQUID with its own eggs- the other starter. Also great texture and a nice contrast to the sweet tasting mushrooms\nNIGIRI (10 pcs)- Kanpachi (amberjack, Japan), Hirame (halibut, Korea), Skipjack, Tai Kobujime (kelp marinated wild sea bream (Japan), Isaki (wild three line grunt, Japan), Kohada (wild gizzard Chad, Japan), Tsuri aji (wild horse mackerel, Japan), Sakura sake (cherry salmon, Japan), Hotate ika (wild firefly squid, Japan), Kasugodai (wild Young snapper, Japan), Wagyu (Japanese A5 beef, Japan). MY absolute favorite of this bunch was the cherry salmon, it's delicate and light in flavor with a hint of fragrant sakura, I really wanted to eat my husband's piece too but that would be too shellfish of me. It was a lot better than the cherry salmon we had at another Jpn restaurant a week ago. Waiter said cherry salmon is only in season for 2 months in the year... I'm guessing around cherry blossom season? The firefly squid and wagyu was also amazzzing. \nUNI- ordered 2 pc nigiri after omakase. Pretty good for Japanese uni found here. I was not wow'ed (since I've had better Japanese uni), but I was told by another Japanese cuisine chef that this year has not been a great year for Japanese uni so this year's uni just doesn't taste as good. Nevertheless, it was carefully and well prepared, rice was on point.\nTamago Atsuyaki- ordered 2 pc as our dessert! Made with organic egg custard and blue shrimp. Sooooo good. I could taste the tiny hint of seafood from the shrimp! Texture was almost like a honey cake, but more refined\nSWEET POTATO BEER- good beer, served in a fancy ceramic(?) pint\nENDLESS hot tea- I must have had at least 6 cups during our meal\n\nSERVICE/STAFF were helpful and courteous. You could see there were at least 6 chefs behind the counter working, a couple servers, one waiter, and one hostess. Each item was clearly introduced when brought to us and staff asked us how we were doing from time to time. Tea cup was never empty (I like!)\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR is simple and elegant. Noise level is average, not super quiet due to the fact that it's a small space with three tables and several counter seats, but intimidate enough for a lovely date. \n\nOverall, a lovely restaurant for some traditional nigiri/omakase and small dishes that are all prepared really well. I overheard the table next to us talk about Ijji compared to Kusakabe- the gentlemen said he likes Kusakabe more. I personally feel like it's hard to choose one over the other because it is comparing two different styles. Ijji is about taking Japanese seafood and preparing it in an excellent way, it is more traditional Japanese whereas Kusakube involves some less traditional techniques and concepts.  I like them both. I like Japanese food, as long as it's solid :P", "author": "Iris H."}

Our Chef Alex (Korean) was extremely detailed and always keep his counter clean.  There are no cross over taste on any of his dishes.  I am very impressed by our sushi chef. \n\n2.  The caucasian waiter was extremely knowledgeable and provide services you would only expected from Japanese servers.  He was probably one of the better waiter that I have met in Sushi place in US.\n\nSushi-\n\nPro-\n\n1.  The treatment of fish was excellent.  The flavoring was very creative.  I was really impressed by this-  I will go into detail below.\n\nA. Nama Tako-  use of sakura powder and salt really brings out the flavor of Tako.  Well done.\nB.  Aji- one of my favorite fish- the fish was sweet and comes with just right amount of ginger and onion.  (This would have been exceptional- but the rice really really underwhelmed)\nC.  Belt fish- the fish was perfectly seared with salt and ginger on top. \nD.  Firefly squid- this was the best dish of the night.  As the nori combined with the rice and perfectly marinated squid.  Excellent dish.\nE.  Anago-  Not as good as Kusakabe- but still one of the better in the bay area.\n\nIssues-\n\n1.  Rice-  the rice was way too sticky and undercooked at same time.  Its also extremely blend.  Every single Nigiri (other than firefly squid)- the fish over powered the rice.  Its just extremely blend rice and cater to american taste buds.  \n\n2.  Cherry Salmon- the marinate wasn't good enough.  Complete lack of flavor.  Sushi Yoshizumi cherry salmon (which I had on wed) completely destroyed Ijji.  I really felt sorry for the poor trout.\n\n3.  Negi-Toro-  This is also just awful.  The Toro was quiet fatty.  But the scallion and the ginger wasn't mixed well.  All i taste is just fat.  One of the worse ever.  \n\n4.  Tamako Atsuyaki-  please do not make Tamako Atsuyaki if you can't make it right.  it was just pure sugar and dry.  Like Omakase- both of their Tamako are simply not up to par.\n\nOverall-  this is more like a 3.5 (since yelp does not allow .5 star).  Its better than Omakase (which i am not sure how it got michelin one star).  Its just below Wako.  \n\nI really enjoyed dinner here.  But just too many mistakes and rices is simply not up to standard really killed the rating for me.\n\nI really hope that they could offer traditional Japanese style rice.  It really could be a lot better with just change of rice.  Also, the wasabi also needs to improve.\n\nI can feel that they put a lot of effort into their fish.  Please improve on the rice and wasabi!!!!!", "author": "Jerry W."}

It reminds me of Japan where they let the quality of ingredients speak for itself, and not rely on exotic ingredients and fancy presentation for the wow factor. Everything is executed with precision: the sushi rice is seasoned perfectly, each piece of fish is cut to the right size and thickness, the ratio of fish to rice is just right for a single bite. I remarked to the sushi chef about how beautiful the soy sauce is - full of flavor without being too salty (I think I even used the word sublime). And he nonchalantly remarked that he made it himself, like it is no big deal. So... a little bit of a back story about me here, my mom happened to be obsessed with good soy sauce and once sent me artisanal soy sauce (yes, it's a thing) home from Asia. I prayed it wouldn't explode in my luggage, and it did survive so I do know something about great soy sauce :) Anyway, I digress. My point is, these people are hardcore purists, I could taste it in the freshly ground wasabi and ginger as well. On to service: I brought a bottle of Puligny-Montrachet, La Truffi\u00e8re to drink with dinner, and offered a glass to the chef, which he graciously accepted and slipped in an extra course that was not even on the menu! It was a very fantastic clam dish that had the umami and toothiness of abalone. Understandably, people on both sides of me at the sushi bar shot me an envious look. The wait staff in general were quietly\u200b attentive without being obstrusive, almost ninja-like. This place totally transported me to Japan. I get this place, it is utterly honest and unpretentious, and there is beauty in premeditated simplicity. There is no clutter, just purity distilled to its essence... like great calligraphy.

I found out about this restaurant when I saw a list by OpenTable of the top 100 restaurants in the US. When I checked the website I had to try this. The only way to dine here is to make a reservation well in advance. There are no parking lots nearby so you have to unfortunately need to find street parking. Restaurant has no large signs so it can be easily missed. The place only seats about 16 people, with a bar and 2 small tables. The venue is very nice and the service is top notch as they are attentive and they spend time explaining what each coarse contains.\n\nThe menu changes from day to day so the courses I mention may not be available if you try.

I was invited for their soft opening and was thoroughly impressed by this quaint, tiny restaurant.  \n\nOur party of four decided to go with the omakase which did not disappoint.  Most of the fish is from Japan which had some different types I never tried like horse mackerel.  The uni was the best I'd ever tasted minus the seaweed and quail egg usually embellishing this delicacy.  Everyone's favorite was the sweet, buttery flavors of the pink sea trout.  We enjoyed a smooth bottle of sake which complimented our sushi well.  I tried a dark lager Japanese beer which was served in a metal cup and goes well with the minimalistic, modern-rustic themed interiors.  We also enjoyed the hearty chawamushi with fish, clams and other seafood novelty ingredients.  I decided to try the eggplant (Nasu Nibitashi? if I can recall).  I enjoyed chilled eggplant for the first time unbeknownst to me.  I've not seen it this way on other menus before.  I'd indulge again too!\n\nThe most unique thing about Ijji is the absence of the sushi/sashimi essential condiments most are used to:  soy sauce, wasabi, and ginger.

Not trying anymore. \nI can say I love all the nigiri but the most one is 'cherry salmon with a cherry leaf' called 'sakuramasu' - its the most seasonal, the chef said it comes only two months in a year.

My boyfriend and I arrived here on a Saturday night in celebration of my birthday. We were lucky to find a parking spot moderately close by because the area was fairly packed.\n\nIjji only has two timeslots for dinner, 5:30 and 8:30, as the dinner takes AT LEAST 2 hours to get through. We booked the earlier slot, and were advised to arrive half an hour early. We did, and had to wait outside in the cold for 5 minutes :( but didn't bother us much. We were seated at a table for 2, and in hindsight, I really wished I chose the sushi bar! The experience would have been much more fulfilling. \n\nFOOD: we had a total of 20 courses, started with kusshi oysters as amuse bouche and ended with house made matcha icecream with azuki beans. The most notable dishes were the abalone with seaweed and abalone liver sauce, the slow cooked wagyu beef with daikon, the zuke chu-toro nigiri (soy cured med-fat blue fin tuna) and of course my favourite, the uni. Everything had THE perfect balance in flavor and texture, and seriously made me want to cry from joy!!\n\nSERVICE: The servers were very attentive; our water glasses were never empty, each dish was well-explained to us when they were served, and they folded our napkins everytime we got up from our chair to go to the bathroom.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "Our dinner at Ijji was quintessential and one of the best omakase we have had throughout the world, including Japan. Each small, beautiful plate had a perfect balance of flavors, temperature and texture. They are masters in bringing just the right salty, sweet, sour, bitter and umami, then hot, warm and/or cold, and lastly elements of smooth, creamy, chewy and crispy often in the same bite. The last variable was the season and we were lucky to hit the beginning of the cherry blossom blooming so that was incorporated into the Sakura Masu or cherry salmon. Each dish was like a three level chess game of complexity and beautiful tastes.\n\n Alex, our chef for the night, paced our mind blowing plates perfectly and spoke to us about each dish as it was presented. He highlighted the differences in tasting of the item and explained where it was sourced from and what type of influence the location had on the flavor compared to other well know source locations for the same product.  \n\nSurprising standouts outside of the sushi/ sashimi were the Mozuku, a silky seaweed with pear in vinegar from Ishikawa that captured the perfect little ocean, and the Akadashi, red miso soup with egg tofu. The best miso soup I have ever had and the tofu was prepared like a perfect little souffle.\n\nOur only recommendations to the restaurant would be to add a sake pairing to the menu, we created our own and the matcha Ice-cream needed one more texture element and perhaps a little something acidic to counter the creaminess richness of the ice cream as well as the smooth, subtle sweet of the azuki.\n\nDefinitely a wonderful restaurant that we highly recommend and look forward to returning.", "author": "Anna S."}

Our server refilled our drinks and even changed out the little wet nap for you where you wipe your fingers after eating the nigiri with your hands. From what I know, no place has ever done that yet. \n\nFor the Omakase you get 10 items- 1 appetizer and 9 pieces of nigiri. It says MP, but when the bill came they just charge you by each piece. It wasn't a set price like $85 or $100. The price was still reasonable, but thought that was a big odd. Never seen that yet for omakase. \n\nWe got a few apps to start off with. This seaweed broth thing which looked really weird, but it was pretty good. More like very thin seaweed noodles in a cold broth. The chawanmushi was good. Had a lot of fish and other seafood in it. The snow crab was refreshing, but nothing wow. \n\nNow for the fishes. So delicious. All of them had a different flavor. The rice was really good and super fresh. 2 things I never tried was live octopus and barracuda. It was very good.

Got the scallop, which was a thumbs up and my friend told me to get this one fish that is suppose to have some smokey flavors. It just tasted like a plain ahi tuna to me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-10", "description": "4 Stars rounded up. \nIjji describes itself as a neighborhood Sushiya and they completely are. The service was prompt and amiable and never once did I as a solo diner feel uncomfortable. \n\nI first visited last year in February and wanted to try their new omakase only menu and it is a definite improvement compared to last year. The new price gives them a lot more structure and attention to detail/quality that it was missing from last year. The new price is $135 for 13 pieces of nigiri and ~4 tsumami, along with red miso soup and dessert. This is a VERY reasonable price when you compare how many pieces you get plus tsumami compared to other places. \n\nIjji uses a combination of three different vinegars in their rice; shirazu (white), akazu (red), and an aged akazu (red). While it was an interesting combination I felt like its mixture made it lack an identity that didn't completely compliment the fish itself. Unfortunately, the rice was slightly cold and a little overcooked :(. \n\nTo summarize their fish; of course its fresh, no sinew and everything of top quality. As for garnishes its all pretty traditional, which is good! A blowtorch was only used on one piece and their seasoning was mostly their own house made soy sauce (a tad salty), yuzu, and seaweed salt. At the beginning of the nigiri course the main chef whom I had the pleasure of being served by said that we could adjust the seasonings (wasabi/soy sauce) according to our tastes. I feel like this openness isn't found in other Sushiyas due to a fear of the chef being a sushi-nazi. Highlights included a secret menu ankimo braised in their soy sauce and dashi, hokkaido sea scallop half with seaweed salt and soy sauce, santa barbara and hokkaido uni together, braised octopus, and kama toro. The ankimo was EXTREMELY tender and flavorful, completely beating Sasaki's chalky and firm ankimo. The sea scallop was extremely fresh maintaining its firmness and succulent sweetness juxtaposed by the saltiness of soy and salt. The other pieces were definitely solid and highlighted the silver-skinned fish predominant in the winter season. \nTheir ala carte menu is also fairly small, most of it repeats of what was in the omakase, aside from ikura, kama toro, and hotaru ika to name a few. No wagyu for those wondering. \n\nService wise this place gets a 5/5. The chefs and waiter/waitress were all very friendly. The chefs explained aspects of the fish such as wild vs farmed, different fishes caught in the season, and their cooking process for some of their dishes. They were also extremely open to answering questions. As for service I never felt pressured with time or ordering more drinks. As for their alcohol menu they have the standard Japanese beers available (Hitachino, Coedo, Echigo, Suntory), some wines, and an OK sake list. Their choice of sake leaned toward tokubetsu and Ginjos, which I feel compliments their aesthetic as a neighborhood Sushiya. \n\nOverall I don't think Ijji compares with other places in terms of creative flavor combinations, an expansive sake list,  or a huge ala carte menu, but it does what it does great.

The restaurant is tiny, but beautiful updated.  On the night we enjoyed dinner at Ijji, they had run out of a few items.  Fortunately, the server told us in the beginning.  We ordered the omakase.  Two appetizers were served, one asparagus, and the other conch.  Both were lively and full of rich flavor.  Nigiri included amberjack, octopus, medium fatty toro, horse mackerel, sea bream, halibut, salmon roe, Arctic char, belt fish, and clam.  The stars were the amberjack, toro, and sea bream.\n\nIn addition we had the snow crab, which is fabulous, and the A5 beef nigiri which is great but maybe not worth the money relative to the other nigiri.\n\nEach course was timed to maximize the experience.  A course would explore texture and unique favors as complements to the fish.\n\nYou get what you pay for here.  Ijji is pricey as expected, but well worth the money.", "author": "Justin D."}

We walked in on the later side and had a drink at the Page for about 20 minutes until our bar seats were ready. I'm so happy we opted for the bar; the lighting was perfect creating a movie-like setting watching the three sushi chefs work their magic. There is a fourth chef that stands in back right in support, but he sort of just hangs out there the whole night. We took the classic nigiri omakase and every single piece was perfect; each bite was tender, no connective tissue or other issues. Highlights included the fire squid, which is only in season for about 6 weeks each spring, the Hokkaido uni (smaller and denser than it's California counterpart) and the toro, which was order separately. Also props for their rendition of ankimo which had the liver intact versus the pate form found everywhere else I've eaten. The chefs were quiet but eager to educate with any question I had about the fish, it's origin or how to eat it properly. The sake menu is extensive and I'd suggest trying by the glass versus a bottle so you may try the wide variety-- as always, stay dry, my friends.", "author": "Brian J."}

It was a bit odd in that the omakase price was listed as MP.  All other restaurants we have been to state their set price.  Maybe their omakase changes with each person so hard to set a firm price though we were not really asked what we wanted, it seemed more set.  \n\nThat being said, we enjoyed all the fish.  Their ikura btw was really good! You could tell it was fresh and homemade with big eggs that popped in your mouth!  No gumminess.  My favorite was their hotate, scallop at $6.  I had to do that one twice! Very sweet!  They said it was live from Japan.  I think though what they consider live and what I consider live maybe 2 different things.  I expect live to be in the shell minutes before served.  I think, and I may be wrong, but I think they mean never frozen.  That being said, it still was excellent!  \n\nThe wagyu we ordered after the omakase at $13 a piece was the only nigiri that did not meet expectations.  Not bad, but not great either.  I find the quality really varies place to place with most places not serving A5 that is worth the price.  For $13 for a skinny little piece of beef, it best be a very tasty skinny piece!!!  LOL.  After you have had the good stuff, it can be disappointing.\n\nWe also really enjoyed our sushi chef, David.  He was most agreeable.  Very chatty and informative.  There were 2 waitresses both of whom really set a friendly atmosphere.  We interacted a lot with Katie and she was a real delight.  Such good waitstaff is worth their weight in gold!!\n\nI was a bit apprehensive when David pulled out a plate of precut fish for our omakase from under the counter.  Though I think it must have been cut fairly recently since the flavor was still good.  We were the 1st customers and with a slow beginning before they got busy, they had plenty of time to cut the fish as needed instead of precutting it.  As the night went on, it seemed that only 1 chef did the cutting and passed the cut fish to the other chefs.  They had plenty of help with 4 sushi chef always behind the counter for such a small restaurant. \n\nWe would definitely frequent this restaurant if we lived nearby.  The quality at Ijji is solid! \n\nI suspect that with repeated visits, we would discover a lot of special touches unique to Ijji.   If we lived nearby, we would enjoy discovering them all!! \n\nParking is hit or miss it appeared.

Then moved on to nigiri, ordering 13 pieces. My favorites were the Negitoro (fatty tuna with green onions), Umi Masu (ocean trout), Shoyu Ikura (soy sauce marinated salmon roe), and the Muki Hotate (live scallop) -- all were really well executed and fresh tasting.\n\nI finished off with a piece of the Tamago Atsuyaki (japanese omelet), which was so delicious and cake-like with a subtle sweetness that it easily acted as dessert!\n\nMy only critique of the food was that the Uni was served a bit cold for my liking.\n\nDon't expect rolls and soy sauce here! This is a nigiri-focused restaurant, and the pieces are seasoned as the chefs intend them to be eaten to bring out the flavor of the fish.\n\nIjji is a great addition to the neighborhood and city, and I'll definitely be back... though maybe not as frequently as I'd like, given the price.

Everything about them was top-notch.\n\nFor sushi, we initially ordered Omakase (chef's menu).  When it's done, we added 3 pieces and Tamago (egg) that our amazing chef recommended.  There was nothing that was \"just ok.\"  Every single sushi was work of art.  It was beautiful to detail and tasted absolutely fantastic.  My friend and I kept nodding for each sushi as we enjoyed several stages of tastes changing in our mouths.  I felt my brain melting...\n\nThe style of their sushi is not the one you put soy sauce on your own.  Chef does all the work, and you eat them as they are presented.  Ijji sushi suggests customers to use their fingers for sushi instead of chopsticks.  Sushi actually tastes better eating that way because we can keep the perfect condition of sushi until we put it into mouth.\n\nTheir sake was incredible too.  The list is not big, but they've got really good ones. We ordered a bottle of Konteki Daiginjo (Tears of Dawn) which I never heard of before.  It was ABSOLUTELY delicious and perfect for sushi.  I also like their idea that they use a wine glass for sake.  We got to enjoy subtle aroma drinking that way more than drinking from a regular sake glass/cup.\n\nService was excellent.  Everybody was super serious about providing great dining experience for customers.  Our service person was very attentive and professional.  He actually looked casual but his service was formal, which I liked a lot.  One of examples was that every time my glass became empty, he showed up right away but asked me if I'd like more before he actually poured sake for me.  And every time we asked him something, he said \"certainly\" instead of \"absolutely\".  \n\nAppetizer was also delicious.  We ordered Chawan-mushi (savory egg custard), Akadashi (clam miso soup) and Kani Sunomono (Cucumbers and crab in vinegar broth) and loved them all.\n\nI highly recommend to make a reservation so you can sit at sushi bar.", "author": "Akiko O."}
