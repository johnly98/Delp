If waiting over half an hour (and through 2 servers and 1 runner) isn't enough, we ordered the lunch special, which is 2 entrees, a smaller serving of dim sum, and green tea ice cream for dessert, and by the time we left, we still had not received part of our meal and our ice cream. \n\nWhen the check was delivered (by the runner, not our server or the other server we had), I tried to explain that we were missing part of our meal and this was unacceptable. He could not seem to understand, grabbed a third female server, said something in another language to her while glaring at me, and then stormed away (with our ice cream in hand, by the way, which he never returned with). \n\nI then had to explain to the server multiple times that we never received part of our meal, that I did not want it to go, and that I wanted it removed from the check. We ended up paying her (in cash) the price minus the missing food. I would recommend paying in cash if you can, card transactions are hit or miss apparently, and the place is so unhelpful when you're there I can only imagine the headache it would be to dispute a double charge. \n\nWhat drew us to this restaurant was an advertisement for free potsticker dim sum and free green tea ice cream, neither of which we received.

This place is more of like the original chinatown places that have been there since years past.  It has that Chinese feel.  If you know what to order, it is pretty good.  I'm not sure what people are looking for when they go to a restaurant in chinatown.  Some people looking for something cheap and quick but then complain it's cheap.  Some people look for that authentic feel with the traditional decor but complain it's old.

If you read others reviews the complaints are mainly from service and the added gratuity of 18% that you're charged with your meal no matter the size of your party. We had a party of 8 so it didn't matter to us. It's also $1.50 for a bowl of rice. And if you want tea, there's a charge per person. This place is an Asian restaurant and it is in Chinatown (even named Chinatown restaurant) how can you really expect great/good service. Asian restaurants have a reputation of having bad service, unless you're at a real fancy one. \n\nThe food wasn't so bad. Spicy wonton was good, small little pieces of pork filled wontons. Mongolian beef was flavored very well. Spicy eggplant was okay. Fish boiled in spicy sauce I hoped to taste more of that Szechuan spice, it was decent. Chow fun was good. And some kind of chicken and shrimp (forgot what they were called) was good as well. Nothing tasted bad. Everything was decent and there were a few dishes that were better than I expected.

I asked them to present me with a bill without a tip and that I would add what I thought was appropriate.  She showed me a menu, pointing out the princ on the bottom that stated, \"An 18% tip may be added to orders of parties 5 or greater\".  I pointed out to her the operative word \"may\"  and explained that it did not say \"will\" and asked her if she thought the service of her and her staff was worth 18%.  No answer.

There were slim pickings for open places. We passed by a nice lady in front of a place handing out a flyer for free potstickers outside of the restaurant. It seemed like a great choice I.E who doesn't love free things!? We were led up a narrow flight of stairs to the second level dining room. Once inside, there were several people enjoying their meals.We were a little more optimistic. \n\nIt was all downhill from there. Our waitress was very rude and curt. It was not a language barrier/cultural difference, she acted like she could care less to be there. I inquired about the coupon for free potstickers and she informed me they had chicken in them. No big deal, I told her that was fine, we would pass. She mumbled something about \" I will get you something\" and came out with a plate of chex mix and sesame sticks. I about fell on the floor. I couldn't believe that she just set that down. Anyhoo, the food came. We ordered the family style vegetable fried rice ( AMAZING), the Chinese mixed vegetables ( GREAT flavor) and the tempura vegetables (DISGUSTING/NO FLAVOR/TASTED LIKE PURE OIL).

A third waiter asked if we wanted our check from across the room, again never approaching our table. \n\nWhen he came by with the check, I pointed out to him that there were broken egg shells in my SO's meal (which she stopped eating after ingesting a piece of it), he said it was our fault for not telling them earlier. I explained that no one had walked by our table to check on us. I said that we did not feel we shohld pay for her friend rice. He refused to even apologize or do anything but blame, so I asked to speak to the manager. \n\nThe manager came and we told her what the issue was. She did not seem to think it was a big deal that my SO ingested egg shells. She said we could feel free to not tip on our bill. However, we weren't going to leave a big tip anyway due to the very slow speed and lack of attentiveness - we did not see our waitress once after she brought our food.\n\nApart from the fried rice with egg shells mixed in, the food was pretty much flavorless.\n\nThere is no reason to go to this restaurant.

I will ever write for a restaurant. This is just the worst experiences I ever have dining at a Chinese Restaurant. It was my first day in San Francisco. Me and my friend were hungry and couldn't pick a place to eat so we just keep walking until we find a good place to eat. I walk by and there was someone passing out the flyer to us and were very friendly. They even show us the way there I was like hmm nice. I should have check the reviews first before stepping in to the door. \n\nWhen we got there, the place itself is very quiet. There three to four tables. I'm guessing they are tourist too. This place is literally a tourist trap. When we are seated, the waitress ask me what do I want to drink. I normally drink water, I told her can I get a glass of water. Surprising the waitress shocked me LOL. She asked what kind of water?! She said we have sparkling water, and bottle water! I was like can I just get a glass of normal water lol... \n\nI was looking at there Dim Sum menu, I found it was a not a little over price and its in Chinatown area! I'm original from the East coast NYC and there Chinatown Dim Sum is fairly cheap. But I guess not in San Fran! It's okay since we are very hungry and just want to grab couple of stuff before getting good food for dinner. We ordered couple Dim Sum dish's and a large house fried rice to share. It takes them pretty long to bring us the foods. That's fine but the quality of there Dim Sum is not satisfying. There fried rice is good but portion is too small when it suppose to be a Large entree. \n\nBest part is when we get our Check! The price itself is alright. BUT they added the tips itself with a party size of TWO?! Wth?! Even that, I always tip in restaurants even if the food or service is horrible! This place really surprised me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-10", "description": "This place is a tourist trap!!!!\n\nThe prices were outrageous for what you get especially since they gave really small portions. Some of the seafood dishes ranged from $30-40 dollars. Read more below for details.\n\nI was showing a friend from Chicago around town, and he wanted to eat in Chinatown despite my warnings that the restaurants in Chinatown aren't that great.  \n\nWe were planning to go to Z&Y but it and most of the other restaurants where packed with long waits because of a pre-Chinese New Year's Event. My friend was on a time crunch to catch a train back to the Peninsula, so we went to Chinatown Restaurant because it was half empty and could seat us right away.\n\nThe one plus of the place is that they had outdoor seating on the narrow balcony walkways on the second floor. The minus of the outdoor space is that it clearly wasn't built for people to dine on, and I'm pretty sure that they're not up to safety codes. The tables were essentially very small patio tables and with patio chairs which left just enough room for the wait staff to work through. The bad of the outdoor seating is that the tables were so small that it could barely hold the three dishes that we ordered and the table surface was really uneven, so you had to be careful about your drinks.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, it was clear that the place served Americanized Chinese food which isn't my cup of tea, but perfect for my friend since he wanted General Tso's Chicken and Fried Rice. We ordered these dishes and the Szechuan Beef. I can roll with it.\n\nI was really disappointed by the dishes when they arrived though. First the portions for the beef and chicken dishes were really small. Like half the size of typical Chinese restaurant dishes. The plates that they were served in looked huge and empty in comparison. Plus none of them were very good. \n\nThe General Tso's chicken came out more like Lemon Chicken with soft doughy batter and mostly just sweetness. The whole reason that people like General Tso's is because they deep fry it to get a crunchy exterior with both sweet and savory flavors. Other than the typical mixed vegetables and white rice, the only protein in the fried rice were these very sad dry pieces of Chinese sausage that were pretty small. \n\nAt $16 per tiny stir fry dish and $10 for the fried rice which was pretty much all rice with almost no meat, it just really wasn't worth it. And these were the cheaper things on the menu. Their whole fish dish was $43!!!  Prices have been creeping up for whole fish dishes at Chinese restaurants in the Bay Area, but that's just obscene. The allure of Chinese food is that you get cheap really delicious food.  This was neither.\n\nThey did give us a small scoop of free ice cream at the end and two potstickers and the staff was generally nice, but I guess that I'd be pretty nice and feeling pretty good too if I were making that kinda cash overcharging people.", "author": "Lee H."}

(-0- Star). We received our food an hour after we placed our order. We ordered five things: Hong Kong Style Crispy Noodles, Chef's House Special Fried Rice, Sesame Chicken, Mongolian Beef (not spicy), and (self-serve) Shrimp Sizzling Rice Soup. We were hangry!!!\n\nIt took the servers a long time to bring us our food. I suppose it's not their fault, the cooks probably couldn't keep up with the amount of patrons that they are trying to lure from the streets of Chinatown. Workers from the restaurant were giving out coupons (free potstickers and green tea ice-cream) on the streets to get people to eat in the restaurant. Water refills came few and far in between and we have to flag a server. We don't have a dedicated one for our table. There must've been like five different ones who tended to us.\n\nOnce we got our food, though, it was delicious (+1 star). Each meal that we ordered were tasty, crunchy and, overall, our meals satisfied our hunger. The pan-fried noodles came before the sizzling rice soup. The soup was served and I was used to the server preparing this for us which is they usually bring in the soup and crunchy rice on separate plate/bowl (which they did), then they were supposed to dump the rice in the hot soup which was supposed to make the \"sizzling\" sound (therefore the name 'Sizzling Rice Soup')... well, no sizzle and we had to serve ourselves.  When it came time to pay our bill that came late as well and the payment transaction time took long too. -sigh-\n\nThe portions were small for the price of each dish. Our total was $116+ including tip. There were six of us in our party and they automatically added a 20% tip for their sucky service. Boo! The restaurant building has four levels. Most of the guests were escorted to the second level. Restrooms were located on the first level and basement. Parking? Good luck!\n\nReview #0403", "author": "May A."}

There were about 2 ladies on the streets passing out flyers for free potstickers and green tea ice cream. I mean who doesn't like free? So one lady led us to the restaurant and it was on the second floor. We had to walk up a steep flight of stairs. The bathrooms were located on the first floor which was really inconvenient.\n\nTo start off, the service was very slow. They did not really check up on us to see if we needed anything. You could see that they were like that with everyone else too because everyone kept looking around to see where their waiters/waitresses were. There was even one family that walked out and didn't even order anything. Onto, the food itself. It wasn't that great. The portions were small and presentation wasn't that great either. Pretty sure they didn't care about presentation. Anyway, when we tried to pay, they added about a 17% tip into our bill. We were confused as to why they did that because there was only 3 of us. When it was brought to the waiters attention and she was told that we were not paying that tip, she took it off. SO MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR BILL IF YOU DO DECIDE TO EAT HERE! \n\nAfter we finished eating, we decided to check the ratings of this place on yelp.

The ILs love it here.  I was suspicious with the first restaurant solicitor on the street.\n\nThe hostess seats you at a butcher paper-covered table and brings menus. We ask for hot tea and water. One person gets a water. One small menu is a dim sum sampler for $16.95pp. Nowhere does it say minimum 2 people. The server gets an attitude and writes $20.95 on the table paper and circles it, speaking to me like I'm an idiot. She was either nasty or non-existent for the entire meal.\n\nThe man orders a fish and veggie dish. The battered fish and bok choy was superb.  The appetizers were free pork potstickers. Those were hot and tasty as well.  The ILs ordered Chow Mein and shrimp in lobster sauce with snow peas. They had to pretty much beg for steamed rice with the meal.\n\nMy order comes,  and is promptly put in the center of the table, even though it's my meal. The steam baskets had potstickers, a pork bun and shumai. The plate had a chicken skewer, a spring roll and some other fried goodie. There were several listed items that never appeared,  such as spare ribs.\n\nDessert was a very tasty green tea ice cream. We never got beverage refills though, and there were flies everywhere. \n\nFor a party of 4, this was not a $125 plus tax meal.  Do also note: they auto add gratuity,  no matter what.

They really need new owners. This place is also VERY expensive. \n\nThere were many different people that were serving us. We were given a plate of kimchi and gyoza. The gyoza we knew for sure was complimentary but we thought they added the kim chi as well. We start eating and talking. A waiter comes by and takes our plate away. We tell him we weren't finished with the kim chi. He says but you didn't order it. I feel as though we didn't, we were already eating it so why take it away? There was a lot of confusion.

Sadly, we will not be returning.  \nTip to Managers:  Please note it is up to the customers to decide how much tip you get - not you.

For three people we were told we would get two potstickers.   Next, the lady that took our order was nice, but took it wrong and argued with me about it later.  When you order a drink you get a can or bottle and a cup of ice.  If they see your glass getting low, they just come pour more out of your can or bottle against your will.   No more ice.  \n\nThey also do things like ask you if you would like fried rice instead of steamed while not telling you it costs double.  If you ask if you can get plain fried rice without the chicken or veggies in it they say SURE no problem and then still charge you $8.95 for a plate of plain rice with some egg and soy sauce that was tossed on the grill for two minutes.  If I had known it was going to cost so much I would have just gone with plain rice.\n\nThe food itself wasn't bad.  But it wasn't anything special either.  It's all Americanized.  \n\nIf you want water they don't serve tap water so you have to buy a bottle of water.\n\nWe had the sweet & sour chicken (no rice), the \"free\" potstickers, three drinks, an order of pork steam buns (3), and a plate of pretend fried rice, and four wrapped shrimps was $42.20   and they wanted a $7.55 tip (18%).  \n\nI adjusted my tip down for the poor service (they brought someone else's food to our table and set it down and we had to ask them to take it away and they just set it on the right table).

But our question was met with complete hostility - \"So you don't want to tip?!\"\n\nI asked for them to remove the charge so that I can decide my own tip amount. They refused. Fine- I told them that they had charged my card without my permission, and if they would not process the charge correctly, I would just go through my CC company for a chargeback. Immediately, she refunded the charges and brought back a correct bill, and again, asking how much we would tip. We were pretty pissed at this point, so we just said \"3%\", and the three ladies at our table blew up stating that \"10% is standard!\" and \"that's not acceptable!\"\n\nWell, you know what else isn't acceptable?

After placing our order 30 minutes ago, we received one of our orders.. Not all 3 but ONE order. 15 minutes later we received our 2nd order. \n\nNow during this time of waiting our waiter NEVER came to check up on us or give us refills. As the other two people were almost finished eating I asked again where my food was and they said it was on its way out. 20 minutes later I received the wrong order because they had forgot what I ordered. It was not busy at 8pm when we arrived either. So 15 minutes later I received my order after almost an hour an a half of waiting and watching my group eat. \n\nThe food was actually decent but I was so distracted by the service we recieved I couldn't even enjoy my food. We asked for the check a few minutes later. \n\nWe were given the check 30 minutes later and we were over charged almost $20. When I asked why they said the tip was included because we were there past 10pm. Even though we got there at 8 and I waited almost 2 hours for my food to come out. I told our waitress I didn't want to include the tip and she gave me attitude and took my check and went to the back. She came back later and only took $7 off. I asked what the rest of the over charge was and she said it was taxes. \n\nMy bill was only suppose to be $48 with tax and they wanted to charge us $66.00. We decided just to get it over with and pay our over priced bill so we could get out of that awful place. \n\nNot only were we waiting but there were also 5 other groups waiting and it was so bad that a few people who were still waiting on their food or already recieved their order and their party didn't actually got up and left or canceled their orders because no one checked up on anyone or let us know where our food was unless we bugged them and when we asked they would just say it's coming right out. \n\nWE WERE THERE FOR ALMOST 2 1/2 hours. We didn't leave till almost 11pm. AWFUL SERVICE and they try to add unexpected charges to your bill hoping you don't notice. I highly recommend never going there.

My friend and I went to Chinatown, I mean come on its Chinatown  there is this lady passing out flyers right in the corner of Grant and Washington. As some of you would say \"ushering\" us. NO! It felt more like harassing. She had her hand on our back and took us all the way to the restaurant... I mean she didn't force but... I just don't like to be \"ushered\" or pressured OK finally we walk in. I was thinking, \"You know. I don't think it will be bad here.\" I liked the environment. It was actually pretty decent. \n\nFast forward: the host sat us down. We were waiting more than 10 minutes for someone to come over and offer us drinks and to take our order. Finally this waitress comes. No customer service at all. She has such a rude affect, flat expression. I mean go home if you're going to be like that... we asked for water didn't bring it. One thing is we didn't wait a lot for our food to come. Our dishes came pretty fast :) thats about the ONLY GOOD THING\n \nOur food was pretty decent not bad..the quality wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. I was pretty upset with the waitress before but than we got a new one and she was so sweet. I was like ok. I will give you a good tip. Than the other one came back with the same expression of being mad and rude. Ok whatever\n\nFinally... our bill came. It came up to $48.00 I was like da fuc I mean we got two drinks and two dishes... they add the tip automatically!! What the FUCK! NO! You're gonna earn your tip.

It was our first day in SF and we went to chinatown to get dinner. There were ladies on the streets with flyers on every block trying to get people to go in so we went in. It felt like a mistake from the start, and it was. Food was overly oily, salty, and meat was cold. They gave us 4 pot stickers as complimentary dish. It tasted and looked like frozen dumplings. We ordered a dan dan Noodle and it was so salty we had to send it back. It was so salty it was bitter. We thought it was a mistake so they remade it for us and it was worse.

We flew in early and should have ate before wondering about. So, starving, we were looking for anything to eat. We got haggled in to this place off the street. Seriously, this lady walked us from the street corner all the way into the restaurant itself, sat us at a table and yelled into the back, then dashed back outside. First red flag was the completely empty restaurant. We ordered some Oolong and as we chewed our tea we contemplated a way out of the sketch situation we were in. Ultimately we decided to roll the dice and just try it. The shrimp dumplings tasted like glue. Do not order them! The walnut shrimp wasn't bad. The chow mein was good. The chicken fried rice was plain and clearly made with frozen veggies. The potstickers were good. It was FREEZING in the restaurant. Each entree came separately to our table half an hour apart. Two of the three plates at our table were dirty. We personally had to exchange them for others around us. Again, the place was empty, so we got to play a fun game of 'find a clean plate'. The bathrooms downstairs reminded us of the lodge in the Goonies... we were waiting to hear Sloth pulling his chains from the wall or something. Sometimes, a place is a dive, but the food is good enough that you can overlook the sticky tables and stained carpets. Sadly, this was not the case. All around, this place is bad news!

Walking around Chinatown we were hungry and not thinking rationally.  My wife had made fun of the non-specific sign/name  (Chinatown Restaurant?  In Chinatown?  Creative!), when I remembered seeing them mentioned in either a guide book, or on the hotel's tourist channel (probably both). The source said it  was a \"must try,\" so we decided to give it a shot.\n\nThe woman handing out coupons and ushering people inside was quite happy to have a couple that seemed to go inside willingly.  We went up the stairs, and the first thing that I noticed was that the only people eating in the dining room were white. Not a good sign for a Chinatown restaurant.  \n\nWe opted for a seat outside. They have a very cramped balcony and we were placed under the aforementioned sign. This we actually enjoyed because we had a nice view of the  street below.  \n\nWhile waiting for our server I pulled out my phone and checked Yelp. Oooops! I had checked every other place before even considering going in, and  just by chance we ended up in the place with the WORST reviews.  However, we decided to try to not pre-judge and let the overall experience speak for itself.  At the very least the food couldn't be worse than the one Chinese place we have (had; it finally closed) in our town.\n\nI liked this place more than most other reviewers, which is why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1. The wait staff was actually friendly with us. I did order a water that never arrived, but looking at the other reviews, that is a good thing because they charge for water.  The tip was not automatically included on our bill for two, but that would not have mattered either way because I was prepared for it; but I was glad to see it was not on there this time. We also were not overcharged for anything. Yes, the prices were too high for what we received, but they matched the prices on the menu.\n\nIt is true; the food is not good. The free potstickers were flavorless, and the dipping sauce was inedible.  The Combination chow mein was not horrible, but all of the meat in the dish was dry and stringy.  We also tried the General Tso's chicken...  The batter smelled a little of fish, but otherwise it tasted all right. Yes, you could have slightly better food at Panda Express, but it  doesn't come  with the cool  balcony.\n\nOh, and  the Green Tea ice Cream was actually pretty good.  But we were feeling a bit ill, so we gave it, along  with half our leftovers, to a nice homeless woman across the street.  At least we knew  she'd appreciate it.\n\nDefinitely a tourist trap.

We were a bit desperate and willing to try anything so they caught us at the perfect time. Dim Sum was what we wanted and they had an extensive amount of options for our craving. \n\nThere were some questions about the specials we could not have answered which was the first problem we ran into: the language barrier. My family enjoys laughing and being loud, so were a bit let down to enter a very quiet environment. The second story was being used for the main dining area which was relatively full, but it felt like a library. If a nice quiet dinner is what you are interested in then you will find that here. \n\nThe food itself was not bad. If you order a entree you get free pot stickers, but the catch is that even if you order six entrees you still only receive one free serving of pot stickers which amount to about five. We got the family meal which was a little bit of everything. There were these pieces of chicken on a stick which were \"like chicken McNuggets,\" according to my sister. I enjoyed the honey glazed shrimp along with the rest of my family who quickly ate it up. \n\nMy mother described the meal as \"nothing to write home about,\" which is exactly how I feel.

At first glance it seems pretty chill, it's a very large restaurant and the menu looked pretty good. However, the service is pretty sparse, aka it takes forever to order, get your food and receive your bill. \n\nWe ordered the mongolian beef, the eggplant with garlic sauce and the xiao long bao. When they asked us what we wanted to drink we of course said tea, but also water. THEY CHARGE $3 FOR TEA! WTF. And it's not even that good quality tea -____- Be careful, I'd just get water and save my money. The food took awhile to arrive and when it did it was so-so quality. I liked the eggplant the best; the dish looked very pretty with the purple eggplant but the sauce was mediocre and the chilis weren't even that spicy. The mongolian beef was okay, but it kinda tasted Panda Express-y which isn't what you want when you go to a restaurant. The XLB took an extra 10-15 minutes to even show up and by that time I was kinda full. Even so don't order the XLB, the outer skin is too thick, there is barely any soup/juice inside and the meat quality is meh. Definitely a disappointment. \n\nWe did receive a free plate of gyoza and ice cream for dessert since we ordered an entree. The gyoza was so-so but the ice cream was pretty good I'll give them that. However, once we received our bill we noticed the charged us for tea (which I already talked about), rice (lame) AND they added a 15% gratuity!! Service was nowhere near deserving this amount but my boyfriend was fed up at that point and we just paid and left. So shady.\n\nIn the end I'm NOT coming back here anytime soon. They definitely rope in the tourists and charge $2-4 MORE for each dish than any of the other authentic places nearby. Save your money and go somewhere else!

We then went inside instead and things were old, falling apart, and instead of running the AC, they had a fan per table. \n\nWe ordered only 3 dimsum dishes, they were mediocre, I wanted to try sf dimsum to see if it tastes better than nyc.

We had pork dumplings, fancy fish dumplings, pork buns, Hong Kong style crispy noodles and soft shell crab (at $9.95 it was totally not worth it, small and fishy tasting... Don't order). + 4 sodas. Total bill with tax n tip= $67 for 4 people. No alcohol. I think this is the most expensive meal I've ever had in Chinatown. Should have cost closer to $40 out the door.\n\nFirst the good- \n1) green tea ice cream. Free with meal. \n2) Nice atmosphere- authentic Chinatown ambience.\n3) not overcrowded and no wait (probably due to bad reviews) \n4) the pork dumplings were very juicy and fresh (they gave us 6 for $3.95 so not bad)\n5) pork buns (3 for $3.95, again tasty and reasonable price)\n\nNow the bad\n1) never a good sign in Chinatown when no Chinese people are eating there... This should have been my first clue \n2) soft shell crab for $9.95. Very fishy taste  and possibly the very worst I've ever had\n3) Hong Kong style crispy noodles with chicken, BBQ pork n shrimp for $12.95. Expensive compared to other places nearby where I've paid an average of $7.95. The pork tasted old/leftover, the shrimp tasted fishy, and the chicken seemed boiled and flavorless. The noodles weren't as crispy as I like\n4) sodas were $2.00 each... I suppose that's probably average.\n5) service once we put our order in seemed slow. Then they brought our check pretty quickly without asking if we wanted more, which we did... Then we waited forever for our pork buns and our revised check and then the return of our credit card.\n\nIf you go here, I recommend getting nothing except the dumpling dishes, and just water to keep lunch costs down. The pork dumplings were about as good as I've had anywhere else, even if slightly more cost.", "author": "Chrys K."}

According to the waitress drinks aren't included in the $100 minimum, so our total food cost before tax was 99.50. When we questioned the waitress, she said she would talk to the manager. He agreed to honor the certificate, but our bill was still over $100, because of tax and the 18% gratuity charged for our party of 4. I'm still not positive everything was added properly on our bill, and the ticket wasn't in english, so there was no way to really verify it.\n\nNow the food! Some of our dishes, like the coconut seafood soup and the house special beef were a little bland. The creamy honey walnut prawns were outstanding, as was the sweet and sour pork. The thai style shrimp were awesome, all our food was hot and came very quickly. We were here during the Chinese New Year Celebration so the restaurant was full, not an empty table anywhere, so the speed was impressive.\n\nService-seconds after being seated they wanted to take our order.

The place was busy and seemed harmless. Mistake. Not checking the reviews before entering. Mistake #2.  The menu is 'family style', however, the portions are not family style size. As other reviews state this place is indeed over priced. They try and upsale the menu by offering rice, water, hot tea, ETC. we had to make it clear we did NOT want hot tea more than once. \nThe service leaves a lot to be desired. At our table we asked for more lettuce cups for our lettuce wraps (which came with a meager 4 to begin with) that were never brought to our table. We waited 10+ minutes for the check. The icing on the cake was actually at the table behind us. A very calm, collected woman told her server she did not like a shrimp dish and asked for it to be taken from the table. In any other restaurant, this would have resulted in an apology from the server, an offer for anything instead of the dish, and it being taken off the bill. NOT HERE. The manager approached the table and argued with the woman about why she didn't like the dish. The shrimp didn't taste right- and honestly it doesn't matter what the reason is, the customer is always right. The manager said 'we don't like the way you say our shrimp is not fresh'-- not class or tact at all. After a heated manager told the woman that she was not going to take it off the bill or the table she put the dish down and walked away.  If I would have been the woman the end of the meal would not have been as poised. My girlfriend and I spoke to the women expressing our solidarity with her , asked for the check, waited and, left in a rush.  We didn't ask for free potstickers, mostly because we didn't trust the meat and didn't want to pay the 18% gratuity.  \n\nHonestly, just don't go here. Food quality, cleanliness, and the inhospitable attitudes of the staff make this a total trap.", "author": "Taraneh K."}

I insisted on going to the Vietnamese restaurants (which are all definitely WAY better than this place) on that day, but she insisted \"Oh but my friend thinks it's alright\". She ate her words an hour later.\n\nThe sign reads \u65b0\u674f\u9999\u9152\u5bb6(which roughly translates to \"New Scent of Apricot Restaurant\"), but I thought its name was \u5ddd\u5473\u6765\u5ba2(\"Guest from Sichuan Cuisine\" or something). From the outside, it looked fine; from the inside, it looked too cheap to be a \u9152\u5bb6; perhaps a cafeteria.\n\nI don't remember much about the complimentary pot stickers, but I've definitely seen better.\n\nNow, the main course-- I remember ordering noodles with meat sauce \u70b8\u9171\u9762, and my mother water-boiled beef \u6c34\u716e\u725b\u8089.\n\nWhen we were at the restaurant, there were like two to three tables of customers. The wait time was a little bit long with few customers, but whatever.\n\nMy mother and I had expectations on Chinese dishes, especially on Sichuanese dishes(that's what we are):\n\nThe noodles(not Sichuanese) fell short on my standards: It felt way too wet. If you can hear the noodles making noise while you're mixing the ingredients, then it's not a good sign.\n\nThe beef(Sichuanese) was way worse: For some dish around $16, the proportions did not match the price(i.e. too small), and the dish itself was so heavily diluted that it's nowhere near spicy(at least in my opinion; my mother didn't even feel the spiciness). We can get better spicy beef out of another restaurant in Chinatown.\n\nWe only asked for take-out because it was wasteful to leave food like that. The waitress only gave boxes for us to pack(which is fine, but this will matter later).\n\nNow this part I remember VERY vividly:\n\nThe tea was a sad joke. I'm aware that some restaurants offer complimentary tea while others do not, but we looked inside the teapot and the tea looked cheap. Still, we were charged $3... Just for the cheapest tea out there.\n\nThe green tea ice cream and fortune cookie... To me, the ice cream is very out of context because I've never seen a Chinese restaurant offer green tea ice cream as dessert; I would be fine if it's just a fortune cookie. Personally, I thought it was weird.\n\nOh, and the tipping. When we asked for the check, the waitress gave a check with the tip already written on there-- And it was pretty damn high for a low-standard restaurant like this. I mean, you expect to have such a high tip when you didn't even bother to pack the take-out for us? Really? So we caught it and asked the waitress to slash off the tip. (Afterwards, my mother bragged to her friends that she called off such a restaurant service.)\n\nAt the end of the day, we were two unhappy LOCALS treated like Chinese tourists. The Washington Cafe right across the street would've been a much better choice. Cheaper too(we spent about $55 in total).\n\nComplimentary Wi-Fi doesn't help the restaurant much either; stay away from this restaurant, no matter how much those ladies on the street on Grant and Washington compel you to.", "author": "Derek T."}

We ordered the broccoli beef, a vegetable dish, and a fried rice as well as plain rice. We also ordered a couple of appetizers and a few sodas.\n\nI honestly didn't have high hopes for this restaurant, because it is a tourist trap.  However, I thought I'd give it a try anyway. Surprisingly everything we ordered was good. \n\nI know that at this point you're thinking...\"how can anyone screw up a plate of vegetables and broccoli beef and fried rice?\" Well, it has been done and I was extremely happy-shocked even that their beef  WAS NOT chewy (cheap meat) and over-gelatinous. The vegetable plate was also very pleasing as it had perfect balance in taste (not over-garlicky or too much sauce). The fried rice even tasted \"clean\" (not too greasy). The appetizers were tasty as well.\n\nSo, while I understand that some Yelp reviewers have complained about the price...I refuse to do the same. I do not mind paying more money for better quality. I will definitely dine in their facility again. And I never had an issue with a long wait. As a matter of fact we were in and out. It could have been, because I had a toddler in tow, but in any case the staff (yes plural, bc a few people tended to our table) was extremely helpful and polite. \n\n\nThe free green tea ice cream at the end is also very nice.\n\nCheck it out for yourself!", "author": "Angela K."}

And it was ok, nothing special. You can get it in other Chinese food restaurants. My sister and I were walking around Chinatown and a lady comes up to us trying to hand a coupon. We say no thanks and keep walking. Then another lady comes out of nowhere basically trying to drag us into the restaurant with the same coupons. It was already 9 and we were hungry so we just settled for it. You get free potstickers and ice cream with the coupon. But the catch is, you have to buy a pricier entree. You only get two small potstickers, and one tiny scoop of ice cream. The setting is weird because right when you walk in you have to walk up the stairs. The restaurant is on the second floor. The waitress was ok. We felt rushed and she came off very rude. I never got a refill on my water and was forced to drink from my sister's cup. She rushed to get the plates off our table but I wasn't done eating yet. The other two tables by us were complaining of how bad the service was as well. It's a good thing they were talking about it bc we were surprised when she brought our check and the tip was already written down as the \"total price\". They basically include the tip in the total for you but it is not required! The other table told us we can tell her that we only want the actual total charged not including the tip. I work for two restaurants so I know how customer service should be. When you tell the waitress that you only want the actual total charged, her fake smile goes away and says \"why\" in a very upset manner. Not even an apology or anything.

The waitress was kind of rude by our decision to eat a couple of dishes of dim sum and wait. She insisted that we could not keep the menu with us, but just ask again for the menu when we were ready to order. Clearly they wanted us to order all the food first without sampling any of their food. \n\nThe food really is not great here. Our first two dishes consisted of the lucky fish dumplings and smoky tea duck. The lucky fish dumplings were dry and not tasty. Now I'm a big duck fan, so to be disappointed by their smoky tea duck is a big deal for me. It was really dry too. Overall, we were quite disappointed by the quality of the poor food and rude service.As you can imagine, we did not order any more dishes and we will definitely not be back.", "author": "Jerod Y."}

We both ordered ice tea.  We got the free potsticker. They were good. Only 4 but they were free. Then we got spring rolls (4) but what they brought us was egg rolls (fried) not exactly what we were expecting to get. The egg rolls were ok. Lack filling and very greasy. We then ordered a regular order of fried rice and a regular order of Kung Poa Chicken.  The regular portions were very large and more than enough to share. Both the fried rice and Kung Pao Chicken were very good. We have food leftover. We then got a refill of tea and now she actually brought out a craft of tea.  We also got a fortune cookie and some green ice cream that was very good and free.\n\nI gave them two stars because the service was terrible and the bill. OMG. Lets see they had the fried rice 8.50 the chicken 11.50 and spring rolls 4.50 but for drinks it had $10.00 yep that's right. She said ice tea is 2.50 a glass no free refills and she said I even gave you extra with the craft with yiur second glass of tea.  REALLY!!!! Shocker!  Then she got mad that we questioned the bill and walked off. we then called her over again because there was a added fee of $5.95 when we asked what that was for she said they added the tip.

Yep, we joined the club too.  We had planned on going to a restaurant recommended in our Frommer's Guide Book but could not find it when we met up with the hawkers on the street who convinced us to go inside.  They were kind of like the Sirens that lured the sailors to their deaths in the ancient world, only this time they were resplendent with lively apparel and giving out promises of good food to come.  \n\nWe were taken upstairs to the dining area and given a menu, expecting that we would have dim sum as promised by the street people.  The dim sum was on a menu that you had to order rather than on cars pushed around by friendly staff as at other places.  We should have taken to the streets and gotten away while we could but we gave in to the seductive suggestions.  We ordered ice tea ($2.50 for a single glass, no refills we learned the hard way).  Then we each ordered an entree, both of which were not terrible but not exactly great either.  \n\nThe capper of the experience came when we received our bill and found out they had added their own 15% tip when we had planned on giving much less because the service was incredibly slow and the servers avoided us like the plague whenever we needed anything.  I asked the server what that was for and she just muttered, \"15%\" went the other way.  I started to cause a scene and refuse to pay it but decided to just be nice and learn from this experience.  \n\nSo, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED....when friendly smiling people offer you a coupon in Chinatown...run away fast...and find another place, any place to try.  This one is not worth the emotional effort.", "author": "Jerry C."}

Sure there are these ladies on the street trying to lure people in to eat at their restaurant, and in all honesty I ignore them like some begger asking for change. \nAnyway on to the food -\nWe liked it. Yes it is pricey - at least a good 2.00 more than the average Chinese restaurant. We did eat upstairs and there were a lot of people so I thought this was a good sign. You do get free Potstickers and they were small but were really yummy. \nWe ordered some dim sum dishes and liked them a lot. Fresh, hot dumplings .. yum city. We got the steamed pork dumplings and Siu Mai . good stuff. \nWe also ordered combination fried rice which was really good and General Tsos chicken. I never saw it presented like this - longer pieces of chicken as opposed to th usual Mcnugget looking chicken. It was a smaller portion but with the other items we ordered it was fine. Even the free green tea ice cream and fortune cookie was pretty cool. For the price you do get FREE food \nThe tip was already presented on the bill which was interesting. I think places are going to be doing that in the future. \nNo we did not see any fruit flies in any of our food and we did not get sick from eating there, in fact it was a very pleasant digestive feeling. We'd go again, although after reading all the reviews, Id be scared to. I guess we lucked out..or maybe they got their act together. \nThe bathroom is downstairs so its probably better to use it before you go upstairs unless you want some exercise.", "author": "David S."}

I've eaten here several times before and always thought the food was good.\nYes, the girls outside on the corner can be annoying and you end up with about 5 coupons for free pot stickers; but that never really bothered me.\n\nI had a restaurant.com coupon and already knew we were going to eat here for lunch. Being it was Chinese New Year, the place was PACKED!! We only had to wait for about 5 minutes before we got seated, so not bad. They have a good menu with lots of variety and several pre-fix family meals. We opted for one of those as there were 4 of us. Plenty of food to go around and we even had a few leftovers. The food itself was good. Pepper beef had a good flavor. The creamy prawns with walnuts is a must! The seafood veggie was a little bland but mixing with the general tao chicken helped give it some added flavor.\n\nThey took both my coupons, so we got the free pot stickers and green tea ice cream for free. They also took off the 10 for the other coupon; but the bill was still really confusing.\nThere was an extra $14 tacked on. Was this for the tip? Then there was a circled about at $16 that said tip. The original bill came to $131 but then a big $120 in sharpie. WHAT? The table next to us must have overheard because they mentioned they had an odd tip charge as well... are they trying to charge the tip twice? I think so and also think not!\n\nWell, we left them with $120 as that's what was appropriate for the meal with coupon and tip.\n\nHow unfortunate for this. If I can remember correctly, the last time we were there, there was a weird issue with the bill too; but it seemed so minor.\nThis time I will not forget, especially after seeing all these bad reviews.\n\nWith all the other choices out there to eat I really need to find another place that isn't so touristy. \n\nOverall, the food was good.

It was over-priced, disgusting, MSG-infested, and cold.

Well, I was overwhelmed with the choices but then some one from China Town restaurant said \"you come eat here\" and I took a look up and seen the balcony seating and thought to myself \"oh my goodness, I want to eat here\" done deal. As we stepped inside I thought it was rather different that you take the stairs up leading you into the dining room, cool and it was nice a bit fancy but I seen Asians not tourist so I thought nothing of it, then the server took me to the balcony and I absolutely loved it, across me I could see the shops another restaurant with hanging chickens and on the side of me the alley where Chinese kids were playing. I tell you the experience was epic. But, when I looked at the menu, I noticed they were not too many choices and nothing was really different or new to me. Oh well, I was in a good mood, we made our decision as is and I still ordered meals, now I'm not going to come here and tell you that the food was terrible because it wasn't. It had nice presentation, colorful and flavorful, but it took them a while to bring my order, it wasn't all at the same time which I hate and seems like as soon as they brought me the food they had forgotten all about me and never once came to offer a refill on my drink or check on things. They forgot my kids apple juice, no condiments and when the check came they did add a gratuity on-top of it being super expensive for typical Chinese food I could of had elsewhere, don't let the looks of this place fool you into thinking your in Shanghai lol we definitely could have something with more heart at a mamas and papas place with much much better service.", "author": "Hector R."}

It was called Chinatown Restaurant afterall. So we went inside and there was quite a few people. We took a seat - my party of 3 including me- and took a look at the menu. The waitress comes and asks us if we'd like something to drink, so we say water and notice small tea cups on our table so we ask fot some tea also. This is where it got annoying... The waitress aggressively started asking if we'd like anything else to drink, like sparkling water, bottle of wine? Beer?! She does the same thing for the food. We got fried rice, orange chicken, and black pepper beef. She keeps asking us if we want more! As if what we ordered wasn't enough! Then the free pot stickers came and oh my Lord. It was the worst tasting dumplings. It had the texture of a smore with  gross inside, horrible! We then realized why there were so many people inside, all of them were walking in with the little free flyers! I wanted to tell them to turn back but our food came and we tried it. It was TOO DAMN SALTY! Honestly, Panda Express is better. So I just asked for the check, multiple times... We ordered 3 plates and our bill came out to $62.45!!! I asked them what happened so they said they included the pot sticker since it was after their promotional hours?! They charged $3 for the tea! And so I asked them what that little $8.10 subliminally written on the bottom was, and she said tip. No way mother father! We have a party of 3! Tip shouldn't be included, so I complained and asked the tip to be removed. They did and when they brought. Back my change, it was all in pennies. This topped the cake. So I handed them the pennies and said \"here's your tip.\" We walked out and the laty came after us with the pennies and grabbed my hand and placed it in my hands.

I will rarely say this about any restaurant I go to, but I hate this place with a passion. Here are my reasons: the wait is insanely long, the prices are absurd, and the food was OK. My family and I had been walking all day and were starving, so having to wait 10 minutes for someone to at least order our drinks and another 40 minutes for them to bring our food did not settle well with my family. After they finally brought the food we realized how small all the portions were, and we ordered family size! The food wasn't even hot, it was warm as if it had sitting for sometime. When we were finally done the check came out to $81.55!! I was insanely pissed at my entire experience here and will never be back.", "author": "Amanda C."}

I have a feeling there was a lot of MSG going on. Very underwhelmed with their 'dim sum' offerings. Gummy shrimp dumplings, bland steam bums.\n\nThe ugly: We initially ordered two items on their dim sum menu and after we informed the waitress that was all, she yelled at her coworker who sat us at the table and slammed down the menus.  We asked multiple times for our food as well as water. When they brought us the check, they had already calculated the 15% tip and argued over the actual cost of the food. \n\nOverall, NOT WORTH IT.

The app wouldn't let me do half-stars though.\n\nOk, so my friend, girlfriend and I were exploring Chinatown and eventually we were hungry. As soon as we said aloud \"Were should we eat around here?\", a Chinese woman appears in front of us, from the street corner, hands us a coupon then points to the place at the end of the block. Intrigued, we decided to follow her directions.\n\nOnce we found the place a minute later, the staff inside further instructed us \"Come in. Go upstairs.\" Their tone was a tad pushy, but since we had gone this far, we figured we might as well go all the way.\n\nWe arrive on the second floor, and are immediately seated. The spacing between tables was a little cramped, but not insufferable. The decor, a bit rustic, with many antiques spread around for that \"Chinese Ambiance\". The music was modernist electronic reinterpretations of traditional Chinese themes (that was pretty legit). The place was full of patrons, but it was Dinner time, so that should be expected.\n\nWe sat, looked at our menus, and a waitress immediately arrives, takes our drink order and suggested we do one of the group specials, something along the lines of getting 4 family sized entrees and 2 sides plus soup/tea and dessert for 11.95 per person (this meal was originally intended for four people). We went for it. And the food arrived quickly.\n\nThe food comes sequencially, of tea, soup, spring rolls, pot stickers, pork fried rice, chicken chow mein, beef and broccoli and sweet and sour pork, then an ounce of green tea ice cream for dessert (though the miniscule amount made it more of a pallet-cleanser than a proper dessert, but considering the large amount of food we received prior, it wasn't entirely necessary that the serving size be that large).\n\nThe food itself was pretty much standard Chinese Food (just imagine any chinese food you've had that wasn't Panda Express, and that about summarizes the food here), though the Sweet and Sour Pork was awesome. The crust on the pork was light and crisp, as if it were wrapped in the crust of a fresh spring roll, then covered in sauce, which was bright and flavorful. And the rice had a decent range of flavor, but was kinda soft.\n\nThe check eventually arrives and the bill for the amount of food we received was kinda low, which was a plus, although that doesn't take into account the other factors of the overall dining experience you have to deal with to recieve/enjoy the food. \n\nAlthough, there was something on the bill that caused confusion amongst our group: the amount of tip suggested had been written out and highlighted on our bill. We did the math and it was 15% of our bill, which is standard, however we as a group got into a brief discussion weighing the pros and cons of this action.\n\nOn the one hand, it took the guess work out of our payment assesment. On the other hand, it took away the implied freedom to tip as we saw fit for a job well done or half-assed (we thought the service was adequate). Since we are a \"go-with-the-flow\" type of group, we just paid it as requested, since it was fair enough, but I'm sure this little suggestion they have may irk other customers who aren't as pleased by their services.\n\nWe eventually left, full and more or less satisfied. I was quite surprised to see the amount of bad reviews this place had received. In my experience, it was all adequate, marred slightly by mildly pushy sales tatics and mostly good, but not great, food. The environment seemed authentic enough for me, though others may not be as charmed. \n\nMy advice: stay and drink with the fellas, or order the sweet and sour pork to go, and go to the nearby park to eat. The outdoors of San Francisco are lovely in the evening.", "author": "Tony O."}

I grew up in the Bay Area and was visiting on vacation with my boyfriend when we entered the infamous Chinatown. Since we visited during the beginning times of the year of the dragon celebration is was HUGE!!! We had so much fun watching the fire crackers and dragon parades....and then we got solicited by some women on the corner to eat at this restaurant. We figured why not, let's try something new and be adventurous, and because they gave us coupons for a free order of potstickers and looked like they had great combo deals for groups. \n\nLet me just say this, and I'll say this once.....just save your money, time, and taste buds for the grimier places across the street, which are probably a whole lot better than what you'd get at the Chinatown Restaurant. \n\nThere's a reason this place only has 1.5 stars with almost 200 reviews.....because its worthy of its rating. We went in and promptly went to the second floor where the restaurant is located. We were sat, but solidly left alone with menus for 20 minutes in a near empty room. We finally got our servers attention and she scoffed and took drink orders and asked us if we were ready to order. To make is simple we just got the 15.95 combo per person and they send us a bunch different plates and a dessert.\n\nNot only did we not get almost 3 or the items listed on the combo that we ordered, but when we asked about them all they told us was that \"I check\" and then well...nothing. So we waited some more and continued to get the same answer and still....nothing. The dishes finally arrived 20 minutes after the beginning of our meal and we were set for the bill. After finally flagging the server down we got a hold of our bill where we discovered she charged us extra for the items that we were supposed to receive, but didn't. \n\nEnough Said?

We were seated on a balcony which we had to enter through a window. Okay, it was a little charming being able to watch the city below but the dangers of being at a table on a 4 ft wide windowsill under a sign with birds on it are far too high for my liking. \n\nThe staff was slow and super pushy. I explained twice that I wanted tap water but they still delivered and charged me $5 for a 16oz bottle. When we ordered our lunch (usually one appetizer and an entree between my boyfriend and I since we are lighter eaters) and the woman kept trying to tack on extra things... \"skewer\", \"egg roll\", \"pot sticker\". We kept politely declining as we had already ordered everything we wanted. Twenty five minutes later they bring our food. The chef \"special\" fried rice was bland and the pork in it had a vinegar-ish sourness to it. The Kung pow chicken was pretty good, however... So I guess my one star can be for that. \n\nAs we were finishing our food we over-heard the people behind us asking for a manager. They had placed an appetizer order 5 or so minutes before we ordered and their lunch about 10 minutes after we ordered. Their appetizers never came and once they were done with lunch and got their check they had still been charged for them. When they said they were full and no longer wanted them the manager said they had to take them anyway and she would have the cook make them now. \"We don't want them anymore, we are full and our tour bus leaves in 30 minutes\" the lady said. The manager replies \"no changes once order is placed, we make it now and you will take it with you\". Their check also showed that the man ordered 5 Imported beers at $7 each instead of 1 Budweiser at $3. After arguing for 5 or so minutes, they removed the other beers. \n\nAs my boyfriend and I were talking to them (the tables are very close) our waitress delivered our check. He laid down his card and she asked if he would like to leave a tip on the card for a minimal $1.25 fee. WHAT?! A fee to leave a tip? They must not like tips then. Needless to say, we said no... That we prefer to tip in cash. She asked \"so, no tip on card?\". Again, we said \"no, we will leave cash\". She returns with the bill and she had run his card for $5 more than the bill originally was. Wait a minute, what's THIS now? She replies \"that's my tip\". Oh hell no! This place is RIDICULOUS! Although, it's actually pretty funny because we had a $7 tip on the table which my boyfriend  promptly picked up and said \"this WAS your tip\" and put it in his pocket. She jipped herself!\n\nIt's plain to see, they're only in business to rob people. Watch your credit card statement and eat down the road. You can get a better product from honest people for 1/3 the price less than 100 ft away. Don't fall for their silly flyers and coupons. It's just a scam.", "author": "Sarah F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "I have never been motivated to write a Yelp review of a restaurant.  Until now.\nI have spent a lot of time in San Francisco, but this was my sons' first time, so I unfortunately relied on some guidebook's insistence that this restaurant is a must.  It should have read \"must not.\"\nAfter we sat down and had gotten comfortable, the main waitress/manager herded us to another table, saying it was better for us.  It was tiny, and obviously better only for them to free up a larger table.  We ordered water for our sons and two beers for us.  The waitress argued with us, saying that we should get bottled, not tap, water for our sons.  When we insisted on tap water, she stomped off, obviously miffed.  The beers came without glasses.  After only a couple of sips, the waitress came over and asked whether we wanted more beer.  We told her no; we only wanted one each.  She then approached us repeatedly -- at least four more times -- urging us to order more beer, even though we kept reminding her that we didn't want any more.  When we placed our order, she also tried to persuade us to get fried, not white rice.  We were firm that we wanted only white rice.  \nThe \"free\" potstickers were cold and almost inedible.  Our food came one dish at a time, with long gaps between each dish, and the white rice we ordered did not appear until we had finished our meals.  After we had eaten two of our dishes, the waitress plunked down a dish of fried rice on our table.  We immediately told her to send it back, as we had not ordered it.  This caused a big commotion.  She called the manager over, and they insisted we had ordered the fried rice.  We refused to eat it, and they finally took it away.\nAfter about 45 minutes of this long \"one dish at a time\" ordeal, I asked them to bring my sons more water.  The waitress asked, \"Still or sparkling?\"  I said I wanted them to have more tap water.  She raised her voice, and exclaimed, \"What? You would give tap water to children?

I am certain that she has used this ploy to embarrass other parents into buying overpriced bottled water for their kids, when tap water is perfectly fine.  Needless to say, I insisted on tap water, which finally arrived about 15 minutes later.\nThe bill was written all in Chinese characters.  My husband reviewed it, and asked the waitress about what appeared to be a double charge.  She said we were being charged for two orders of Lo Mein.  He told her that we had only ordered one (which was true) and in fact, it came at the end of our meal (with the white rice) and we had barely touched it.  She called the manager over.  The manager insisted that we had ordered, received and eaten two orders of Lo Mein.  She literally screamed at us, \"I saw it with my own two eyes!\"  Again, everyone in the place was staring at us.  I have traveled all over the world and eaten in many, many restaurants.  I have never been treated so shabbily.  I calmly said that as we had not ordered or eaten it, we would not pay for it.  \nAfter a few minutes, the manager came over and slapped the bill on our table, announcing that she had taken off the charge for one of the Lo Meins, as if she had done us a favor.  My husband then noticed that they place a \"service charge\" of 18% on the bill -- on the total with taxes.  Nowhere on the menu or elsewhere did it say that a service charge would be included.  We did not fall for their attempt to trick us into leaving a double tip.\nOh, and the food?  Barely passable.  Never again.", "author": "Deborah P."}

I locked this doorway multiple times to avoid my kids from walking out to the balcony where it is clearly unsafe as it was obvious there were other optional doorways, however the waitresses would not budge. \n\nAs far as the food, let me clarify why it SUCKS! The chow mein was made with fettucini pasta noodles. Okay? The seafood soup had nothing but tons of tofu with a bland water based broth. The mongolian beef was sitting on a bed of stale fried white noodles. How horrible is that? Their rice also seemed to be sitting around for too long. It was all that nasty with a capital NAST-y.

My girlfriend and I decided to give it a try after our favorite restaurant was closed on Wednesdays.  After being accosted by some woman waving a menu in our face, we decided to give it a try as we were both starving.  A red flag should have gone up when she escorted us down the street to the restaurant and practically shoved us in the door.  They seated us outside basically on the roof and it felt very unsafe so we asked if we could be seated inside. Once inside we were given menus and realized that the prices on the menu which we were handed outside were far cheaper than the menu inside the restaurant.  My friend asked for a water and the waitress stated they didn't serve tap water.  She had to shell out $2 for a 12 ounce bottle of Arrowhead water.  Really?  If you want tea, it's $3.  She asked us on 3 different occasions if we wanted appetizers.  Apparently, she didn't understand what no meant.  I ordered the kung pao chicken and my friend ordered the kung pao tofu.  We both love spicy food but that wasn't even edible.  I knew as soon as it came it was way too spicy as it was red in color and had 15 chili peppers scattered on the plate - you know the ones you can't eat.  The waitress kept coming over and looking at our plates so I'm pretty sure it was intentional.  I'm also pretty sure she also thought we were tourists.  Then the bill comes.  We see a $7.49 charge on it and question it.  She tells us it's the tip they think they deserve.  Really?  I tell her to take it off an we will leave what we choose to leave.  Who does that?  Needless to say, we will never go back there again! We both wanted to bring the meals home so we could show our respective spouses.  Unfortunately the bags and containers they gave us had holes in them and well you know how that ended.  Gee I wonder if that was intentional.

We ordered standard fare, Beef and Broccoli, Fried Rice, Chow Mein, etc. and the food was out fairly quickly.  We mentioned to our waitress that we ordered fried Won Tons and we didn't get them, probably because they changed servers right in the middle of our order and she retorted that she had read our order back to us and we didn't say anything about it then.  Okay, you win, we won't order any.  We thought this might affect the tip, but it was already included in the bill.

I have been served fresher and better prepared veggies at a buffet; their meat (and we order beef, chicken and swine) we either tasteless or reminded me of jerky and their prices are quite excessive for what you actually get. \n\nAll of my party, native chinese people, agreed that their pork dumplings (which are supposed to be steamed in a manner that the buns contain soup) was largely inedible and tasted as though they were store bought from frozen. \n\nWe essentially covered all of our food with chilli oil and soy sauce and called it a day. \n\nYet this typically would only have caused me to say \"oh well\" and move on. \n\nPart 2 - Service: the Worse\n\nWhen we first sat down, we were placed at our table by a server who immediately asked us what we would like to order. We said water and our plates, utensils etc... while we looked. I kid you note, she said we'll give you stuff when you order. When we did order and we kindly asked to keep our menus, she proceed to rip my literally from my hands. Unfortunately, this was not a language barrier issue as she proceeded to be rude to my entire party through the entire meal (woe be to us whom may want a second glass of water - the nerve of us) in two dialects of Chinese as well as English. Talk about an all encompassing experience. \n\nPart 3 - the Bill\n\nThe audacity of the restaurant came when we received our bill. A) they first charged us tax on our alcohol, added it to the grand total and then calculated a second tax based on the same - B) they automatically billed us (hidden inconspicuously under the tax) 15% post-tax for tips, FOR A PARTY OF 4! if we were 6+, 8+, I would understand that auto-tipping - further, at the very least if you ARE going to do this at least TELL US. There is no doubt the purpose of this - our neighboring tables unawares, tipped on top of the \n\"total\" which of course the waitress did not advise them of - you can be certain that we did and the patrons were none the more pleased than we were of the circumstances. \n\nIn sum:\nThis restaurant says its a historic landmark since 1919 - I think it speaks volumes that nobody in 100 years has written a positive review about this place.

REMEMBER TO LOOK AT YELP REVIEWS BEFORE YOU GO PLACES, PEOPLE.\n\nThe bestie and I were also lured in by a coupon offering free appetizers and green tea ice cream (how can you pass up free green tea ice cream?!) with purchase of any entree, and a cheerful woman on the street. We were verbally warned by another woman on the cross-street advertising for a different restaurant in Chinatown, but, sadly, chose to ignore her words of, \"Expensive there!\"\n\nWe went upstairs and were immediately greeted by the sight of NO CHINESE PEOPLE eating there. Should have been hint number one that something was up. We were seated somewhat promptly by a disgusted-sounding hostess (my Chinese is fluent, and just because I don't have a Mainland accent like you, doesn't mean you're better than me, thankyouverymuch, jerk), and after seeing the menu with nothing under $10/dish, and since we weren't really hungry, we chose one dish -  (a flattened green bean dish with preserved tofu). It took 5 minutes for a waitress/waiter to notice that we were ready to order, and when she came to take our order and coupon, she huffily notified us that we had to order one dish/person in order to get the free appetizer and ice cream. That's not what it said on the coupon, but fine, we really wanted free green tea ice cream and the potsticker appetizer, so we added another vegetarian noodle dish to the order, but specified that we wanted it with the Hong Kong style crispy noodles instead of regular chow mein noodles. \n\nThe food took 20 minutes to come out, and while everyone else was getting their free potsticker appetizer, we sat with empty water cups. When we asked about where our free appetizer was, the waitress made a snooty comment about us ordering vegetarian dishes and that we wouldn't eat the meat potstickers. That was just frustrating, but we clarified we just like eating vegetables (not mentioning that the vegetarian dishes were the only ones that were less than $15/dish) and would happily eat the potstickers. So they brought out the potstickers for us and, no surprise, they were 4 little Ling Ling potstickers from Costco. \n\nAnyway, 25 minutes later our food finally came out, and the green bean dish was not even made the way it was supposed to have been made. It didn't taste bad, though, but it was overly salted with those salty black beans. The vegetarian noodle dish was actually quite delicious - noodles were crispy and vegetables were cooked pretty well with a full flavor - but the bill at the end was the most irritating. Our bean dish was priced at $9.95, and the vegetarian chow mein was also priced at $9.95 on the menu. BUT when the bill came, it showed that our vegetarian chow mein was priced at $14.95 (SAME PRICE AS THE DUCK HONG KONG STYLE NOODLE DISH) simply for the change of noodle! AND they probably figured people would never tip them for the crap service they offer there anyway, so they had the audacity to AUTOMATICALLY INCLUDE TIP IN THE BILL - FOR TWO PEOPLE. \n\nSaddest thing: THE GREEN TEA ICE CREAM TASTED NOTHING LIKE GREEN TEA. ):\n\nI was tempted not to sign the merchant credit card receipt. \n\nDON'T BE FOOLED BY THOSE CHEERY WOMEN HANDING OUT FLIERS ADVERTISING FREE CRAP ON THE STREETS, PEOPLE. Make sure you Yelp the places you go!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-07", "description": "I don't understand all the bad reviews of this place.  This place is perfect if you are entertaining someone from out of town and they want to have Chinese food in Chinatown.  I don't think many SF residents really eat Chinese food in Chinatown, so if you have to entertain and help your tourist friends check this box, this can be a tough call.  You want to go someplace that's right in the heart of Chinatown, that seems authentic without having a pig's head in the window, clean, not too upscale but not a hole in the wall.  I think Chinatown Restaurant delivers.  \n\nAmbience.  Probably the best part about this place is the ambience.  I was thinking of going to R&G based on Yelp reviews, but then when I walked in and checked it out, it had no charm at all - I don't even consider that Chinatown, I consider it FiDi or North Beach.  If I want Chinatown I want someplace on Washington or Jackson or Stockton or Grant, crammed in the middle of the street with all the action.  This place is right on Wash & Grant.  Also, I think it's cute that you get to climb upstairs.  The outdoor tables were great and the inside area is clean and nice, too.  Also, I don't know what folks are talking about, b/c every time I go,1/2 the patrons are Chinese.  All of the folks in R&G were white. I think very few places in Chinatown meet that middle ground of being authentic looking but presentable, and this is one of those places.  \n\nFood.  First of all, I think Chinese food is kinda like pizza, not sure I've ever had a truly \"bad\" version of it.  We got the family prix fixe share thing for $15 a piece.  The food was not absolutely scrumptious, appetizers like the chicken skewers were bland, but the potstickers were great, springrolls were good, and all of the main dishes including the lemongrass chicken, shrimp fried rice, sweet and sour pork and some kind of beef dish were quite good, hard to mess up these dishes, and they didn't.  The green tea ice cream is not real ice cream, it's some kind of synthetic substance, but nice flavor and since it's free, I can't complain.  Also, the beer selection is nice and the flavored soju was the star of the evening b/c they bring it out in a tall carafe/dispenser that looks like an oil and vinegar bottle which you can share with the table; it's quite fun and delicious.\n\nPrice.  There were 4 of us and the total was $130.  We were delighted that the tip was included.  Unless you are a cheapskate and were planning to jip the waitstaff, you should not have too much of a problem w/ a 15% tip being included, although they should notify you of this policy ahead of time, and there should be an opt out option if the service was bad, which ours was not.  So, we walked away with $33 a piece, which is a bit expensive for Chinese food, but not ridiculous, and we did all drink, as well.\n\nService.  No complaints.  Drinks took awhile and bill took awhile, but they were busy that night and our conversation at our table was good so no real issue.  The food came out very quickly.\n\nCoupons.  I've never heard of people complaining about coupons.  If you don't like them, don't use them.\n\nAnyway, if I didn't have people around I needed to entertain, I would probably just go to Sam Wo or House of Nanking or U Lee over on Wash & Hyde.  But to entertain tourist guests who feel they must have Chinese food in Chinatown, Chinatown Restaurant fits the bill quite well.", "author": "Ginger R."}

I live in the middle of the desert (Tucson, AZ) where acceptable food is very hard to come by, and the dim sum in Tucson is far better tasting than the \"food\" that I ate here. \n\nThis was my first visit to San Francisco, and I was really disappointed after my experience eating here.  On top of that, we paid $50 for \"food\" for 2 people (no drinks, we only drank water), it was outrageous.  There was hardly enough \"food\" on the table to justify even half that price.  I estimate I could have gotten approx. twice as much dim-sum for about 1/3 the price in Tucson (and it's better tasting here, which is insane).\n\nLesson learned -- if you're dining in an ethnic restaurant that's not crowded with ethnic diners, then you're getting ripped off.  (There wasn't a single Chinese person in the entire restaurant, despite the fact that it was completely filled).\n\nLesson #2 learned -- learn how to say \"no.\"  If someone is pushing you into selling their product without giving you the time/energy to think and make a decision, then you're being robbed.\n\nDo yourself a favor and never come here.

I was HIGHLY disappointed with the Chinatown restaurant, and not only was it a waste of money but a HUGE waste of time.. \n\nOn vacation to San Francisco we spent 1 day venturing through chinatown.. We picked the Chinatown restaurant because we were starving, there seemed to be quite a few people inside and someone handed us a flier earlier that day that looked somewhat appealing. When we went to place our order the waiter was so incredibly rude that we did not order entrees she snatched up our coupon and yelled we could not use this, then said it wasn't enough food for 2 people. We ordered 3 different types of Dim Sum.. The sweet potato one was edible but very bland and tasted somewhat undercooked. The shrimp Dim Sum was downright disgusting and had a cigarette taste. The pork Dim Sum was slightly better then the shrimp but still very bland. I would NEVER go back to this restaurant again, even if everything was free. \n\nLater on we asked a local about her favorite restaurants and she informed us everyone that lives there goes to the small restaurants on Jackson street. Next time we will head there for food!", "author": "Sarah S."}

The politeness of the entire staff more than made up for it.\n\nWe decided to share the dim sum special, and it was delicious.

There was an $11.00 charge for beverages. I asked a bus boy what it was.

I know that's passive-aggressive but oh well.\n\nAs we waited to cross the street a block away, out waitress appeared holding the check! \"How much did you leave?\" she asked. I told her. She said the bill was more, I explained I wasn't paying three dollars for sugar water and without free refills. She of course demanded I pay. \"You're the only ones who don't give free refills,\" I told her. She suggested I go around to the other restaurants and see for myself. \"This is Chinatown....\" Ugh!\n\n\"What am I supposed to tell my manager?\" she asked. \"Tell him he's charging unfair prices for drinks.\" She was shouting and I told her the conversation was over. She grabbed my coat sleeve and threatened to call the police. \n\nReally? Are we really having this conversation...here...over ten bucks? Yes, yes we were.\n\nThen the (woman) manager showed up on the street corner. (Uhm...who's watching the store?) Her voice was loud and shrill with a strong Chinese accent. \"You have to pay!\" she shrieked. I explained my position again. \"You got free potstickers and free ice cream, but you don't pay?!\" \"We didn't get free anything,\" I said, \"I paid for the food.\" \"You look like nice people, nice clothes, why you do this?\" The crowds of pedestrians were staring as they passed us. \n\nShe pointed out I had not left enough for the food and even two teas. My mother calmly asked how much that would be. The two women chattered in Chinese and came up with a figure only five dollars more than I had left. I gave them five bucks and they returned to the restaurant. The manager gave her face a flick of her finger, staring right at me saying, \"Shame, shame!\"\n\nOf course I would have avoided all this had I read yelp reviews first, but out and about, who stops and researches a little Chinese joint for lunch? \n\nThankfully Mom was more amused than embarrassed and we've chalked it all up to the adventures of travel.", "author": "Scott S."}

I took one look at the balcony seating and thought that it would give us a great perspective on the festivities below for New Year's.. I know the good spots to eat in Chinatown but this was only one of two that I knew of with balcony seating.\n\nIt was ridiculously busy that day and I'd say 90% of the customers were tourists. When we got to the hostess she gave us two menus and instructed us to go outside to the balcony and seat ourselves. No biggie...it's busy and I have no problem doing that. \n\nWhen we ordered it was pretty much you don't qualify for any specials because you need to have 4 or more people (We had 2). The coupon we received on the street? Total bait and switch. We settled on the $19.95 per person meal which looked like an incredible amount of food on paper. We also asked for one coke and a beer.\n\nIt took FOREVER to get our first dish...a plate of tiny little potstickers that look like the frozen ones I get from Costco :( Whatever..hoping the next plate will be better. About 15 minutes later a small plate of mongolian beef and two tiny bowls of white rice. Another 10 minutes later we get a plate of veggies and chicken (I think) and a small plate of plain...really plain noodles. Finally we get 2 eggrolls and 2 fried shrimp. That was pretty much it. Every plate was the size of my hand...it should have been about 3-4 times that amount by Chinese food standards. Nothing tasted good and all was lukewarm. Anyone who knows Chinese food...at least authentic food...knows if it doesn't have \"wok hay\" that it sucks. Wok Hay is kinda like that extra TLC when you cook, the fire that roars under the wok to such a high temp that flavors come out perfectly and always...ALWAYS! Piping HOT! It's an art form that foodies, especially Chinese foodies appreciate and understand and recognize when it is done right. Just because something is palatable doesn't mean it's good. Chef Boyardee makes raviolis but nothing compares to a handmade Italian ravioli in home made red sauce.\n\nThey finished it off with 2 small scoops of ice cream and a fortune cookie. When the bill came, it was $57.00!!! Oh yeah they added their own tip. I couldn't help but feel cheated, so I asked for the menu to check what was missed. Sure enough they shorted us on 1 dish. It was only after complaints to two people that they refunded us $5. \n\nThe view was nice up there but it was cold and not pleasant at all after 4pm. In terms of Chinese food they really should be ashamed of themselves for ripping tourists off..No wonder why there were no locals there. I've eaten Chinese food my entire life all over the country and even in China. This place is THE WORST in terms of quality, value, and service.

I mean, look at the facts:\n+ It's called Chinatown Restaurant.  Think about that.\n+ The number of tourists and non-Chinese folks outnumber the locals in here.\n+ They need to hand out coupons to lure you in. \n\nIt's a trick, and it ain't worth it!  \n\nAnd here's more reasons, in detail:\n- Food = HELLA EXPENSIVE.  Entrees were priced into the teens, absurdly high prices for the kind of food you're getting!  That 20% off makes no difference when you're paying like $20 for a dish that should be $7.95.  The dim sum here was about $5 a steamer, omgwut?!\n- Food = NOT GOOD.  We ordered fried rice, seafood tofu soup, pan-fried green onion pancake, tofu and black mushrooms with bok choy, and got the free pot stickers.  Fried rice portion was small, and it tasted dried and mediocre.  Although the taste of the seafood tofu soup was passable and comparable to other versions I've tried, it was way watered down.  Pancake had no taste. Tofu was decent, mushrooms were super salty.  Pot stickers were probably the best thing about the meal, and that was because they tasted like the frozen heat 'n serve kind that I like (I bet they probably were!). \n- Our main waitress was rushing us.  To be fair, our other waitress was really nice. \n\nFor the five of us, after tax and a 15% gratuity that was added into the bill, it was $60.  \n\nOh my god.  Although $60 is certainly cheap for five people anywhere else, for this kind of Chinese food, $60 is ridiculously high, do not be fooled by any non-Chinese standards!  \n\nYou should not be paying this much for not-tasty Chinese food, in one of these kitschy Chinatown restaurants that pander to tourists more than anything else.\n\nAnd the final way you can tell it ain't authentic or tasty: you don't lose your hearing in here because it's not packed full of Cantonese grandmamas and grandpapas yelling at each other, with tables packed way too tightly for comfortable maneuvering.", "author": "Vivian C."}

POSSIBLE HEALTH HAZZARD!!!!!!!!!!  \nWARNING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nI should have known when they were handing out discount coupons.  I joined yelp to write a review on this place, yes, it was that horrible, I am not crazy, just pissed off by how horrible of an experience it was.   I am not surprised to see so many other people agree that this place is bad.  If only there were a way we could get this misserable excuse for a restaurant closed.  \n\nSo, my girlfirend and I were going to go to our usual chinese food place when we got the dumb idea to try someplace new becuase chinatown restaurant was handing out discount coupons w/ free potstickers.  I broke my personal philosphy not to go to a new restaurant unless it had been recommended to me.  \n\nSo what happened??  Well, we were seated promptly and it was obvious that is was a touristy place from the get go.  When they brought us the free potstickers they came with this nasty tasting, almost rancid flavored, vinegar sauce.  I am use to eating gyooza's as they are called in japan with soy sauce, so I sort of forvgave them, and handed them back the vinegar sauce plate that reaked so bad it was going to make me nautious.  \n\nThey handed out coupons for 20~25% off, though it seems like they had jacked the prices up before doing so - offsetting the coupon effect.  My girlfirend ordered beef and brokoli and I order genral tsao's chicken.  \n\nOur food came prompty and my girlfriend liked her beef and brocoli but my chicken dinner tasted odd to me as though somthing was a bit off and it had a hidden foul taste to it.  Not extremely disgusting, but my body immdiatly said \"wo!!, don't eat that, somthing is not right with it.\"  I thought that maybe it was just me. My gf tried it too and she immediatly had an unpleasant look on her face. \"there is somthing deffinitly wrong with that\".\n\nBeing a guy who usually avoids confrontations over minor things, I made the mistake of trying to explain to the waitress in a polite way that I felt there was somthing wrong with the food.  Most, in fact, almost all proper restaurants will immedialty appologize and take the food abck to the kitchen. Not these fine people, nope, they wanted to argue about it and embarrass me in front of my girlfriend the others dining there.  \n\nthey ultimately took the chicken back to the kitchen and asked if I wanted somthing else.  At this point I had somwhat lost my appetite and didnt want to give them any more of my money for being rude to me. I told them I was fine and didnt need anything else, I actaully like generals chicken if it is done properly and that is what I wanted.  When I said that I didn't want anything else, they told me I would have to pay half of the cost for the foul tasting food I had sent back to the kitchen, of which I only had one bite of. \n\nI asked to speak to the manager.  When the manager came over, I tried to explain to her the situation.  She told me that she tasted my food and it was \"fine.\"  \"Must be somthing wriong with you.\" she said.  I foolishly wanted to try and reason with her forgetting I was not dealing with a rational person who can be reasoned with.  Luckily for me her cell phone rang in the middle of our conversation and rather than ignore it, she answered it.  \"You are going to answer your phone??  I said.  \"this place is a joke, come on sweetie we are leaving\"  we stood up, I threw the money I owded them for my girlfirend's food on the table and walked out.\n\nI spent the rest up the night burping up some kind of foul smell from eiher the bad gyooza's I ate or that nasty chicken. \n\nI hope the city shuts them down.  It was  a horrible experience for us and it seems many others as well.  I would like to know if there is a way to petition the city to close a restaurant that is obviously creating bad experiances for not only US who live here, but the tourists who help support many who live and work here as well.\n\nthanks for reading, don't go there, unless your worst enemy is treating you to dinner.", "author": "Frank F."}

Kudos for the marketing blitz idea, if only they had a decent product to follow it up with.\n\nBefore I unleash the fury that only a text box can deliver, I shall start with the good. The sesame chicken I had was actually pretty good. It was a plate of chicken strips in a sesame type sauce(shocking) that was different from any other take on the dish that I've had but really pretty good. The pot stickers were also different but very good, a nice clear meatiness to them that I had not yet gotten from a potsticker.\n\nNow on to the reason I'll never go back. \n\nFor starters, even before I ordered I had the sneaking suspicion i was about to get screwed over. The entree's were reasonably priced, but the sides and other things that were usually free(rice and such) were over priced. The waitress pushed us to order a ton of extra crap we didn't want to buy(hot tea!).\n\nThe meal was delivered in such a weird order that it messed with the whole experience. The first thing the brought out was the \"fried rice\"(a pathetic smattering of burnt rice and a few refugee looking vegetables). This sat looking lonely on our table for 5 minutes before my friends entree showed up. After him awkwardly pecking at his food, not wanting to be rude, but not wanting to eat cold food for a solid 10 minutes my food finally arrived. I had to ask the waitress if mine was still coming and she gave me this rushed/automated response \"yes, it on the way\" before flitting off to some other area of the restaurant.\n\nThe bill was what really sealed the deal on this place. Our check arrived and there was some weird added things to the bill that we didn't quite understand, so we wasted another 10 minutes trying to catch the attention of the waitress who had taken our order. The total was almost $40 for two 12 dollar entrees. There was a random $9.50 charge we didn't remember ordering. The older lady who took our order explained that it was for the large(a gross exaggeration) plate of fried rice we had ordered. Now the menu I looked at said that a side of rice is 1.50 and a full order is 5.00, now these prices were for steamed rice, assuming this to be the general guidelines I chose fried rice when asked for my preference. Perhaps this was my fault, but it seems that 10 dollars for a small plate of rice of that caliber is outrageous at best.\n\nI suppose this will seem to be the sad ramblings of a tourist who got suckered by shiny things that disguise the true intent, but it still seems that of all things, a decent chinese lunch should be one activity where I shouldn't have to worry about getting screwed over.", "author": "Braxton E."}

Yes, he was in the bathroom for quite a while, sitting on the toilet. It sounded so noisy and painful that I wished I could shove something in my ears so I wouldn't hear it.

I'm Chinese and in food business and am horribly mortified and embarrassed by you!\n\nI got suckered in by the girls passing out flyers, yes, didn't pay much attention becuz I'm with my love strolling and saw the false advertisment from the flyer!!!! Food tasted and looked NOTHING like the flyer!!!!! I'm usually a dedicated yelper before taking my hubby to any restaurants, but this time, we figure we're just getting a quick app and be off strolling again, bad mistake!!! \n\nAll the negs about the House Witch are absolutely true. We asked in fluent Chinese if the \"Water soup fish bowl\" is a soup, she replied \"Yes\" and she scurried away with our order. Low and behold, the \"soup\" came to our table in GREASY HOT CHILI OIL FISH BOWL!!!! So we asked the kind waitress if that was a mistake, and she shyly replied, \"let me get The Boss\".

But this bowl is full of hot chili oil. She said, yes, this is how its made. Its Szechuan food, you never eat Szechuan before? I said no. And she laughed at me and said, you're Chinese and never eat Szechuan before with a smirk. So I said, we specifically asked you if this is a soup and this ain't no soup, its a bowl of fat chili oil! I told her I want that item cancel off my bill. She said, I can only exchange to another item, that's our policy. So I said, what policy, show me, you don't have that written anywhere and you didn't tell me before I ordered, and you have false advertisement. I don't want to order any more disgusting fat chili oil food. \n\nWe also ordered the chicken appetizer, and beef tendon.

I'll say that these are both valid critiques from the times I've been here, but I will say that people seem to be a little on the whiny side.  This place has solid positive elements, as well.\n\nThe service isn't exactly \"bad\", at least from what I've experienced, it's \"brisk\".  They're running a restaurant and you're a customer and not a guest, and you're made to feel that way.  When I ordered food both times I came here some dishes were hot, some were lukewarm, it took more than a while to get water.  Also, it isn't particularly cheap, though it's acceptable.  On the plus side, they got the order right, so they only lose one star for the service and price.\n\nAs far as the food quality goes, I'm no expert on dim sum, I'm a total white devil, so this may be as Americanized as Panda Express for all I know (not to say that it tastes like Panda Express, this is much better, don't worry).  My yardstick for measuring whether the food is good isn't based on a word like \"authentic\" (because I don't know what authentic would taste like, cause I've never been to China nor dated a Chinese girl who cooked for me), my yardsticks are \"tasty\" and \"not poisonous\" (because I can tell if I enjoyed the food and I can tell if it made me sick).  This food is tasty and not poisonous.  I've gone for combinations both times (one the combo lunch and one the dim sum sampler) and both times I was very happy with the variety and taste of the dishes offered.  It wasn't the best chinese food I've had, but it was on the top half of the list.  I don't need much more than that in my food experience.\n\nThe best part of the restaurant is by far the location and the existence of 2nd floor outdoor seating.  I'm willing to admit that my review may be somewhat more forgiving than I am generally inclined to write due to the fact that both times I went I sat out on the balcony and looked out on the Chinatown street as I ate.  I'm a sucker for a view and this place delivers that in spades.\n\nAll in all, this is a good place to take folks from out of town who don't really know any better and just who want a fun Chinatown experience (dim sum, view of Chinatown, rude service).  That being said, it may not be the best place to go and just get some food when you're in the area (my bet for that has got to be Sam Wo's, just a block away, cheaper and food is more consistent).", "author": "Matt R."}

I grew up in HK (ex-pat) in the 70's and while that doesn't \"qualify\" me as an expert, it sure gives me some frame of reference.  And if nothing else, the fascinating historical photographs of Chinese history in SF throughout the restaurant provide an introductory backdrop for what is about to arrive -- GOOD CHINESE FOOD!!  Tourists -- isn't this what you should be paying attention to?\n\nAnd -- ironically, the fact that the staff IS so polite (I still don't understand these negative reviews on this topic) made me a little suspicious since a \"good\" Chinese restaurant should have rude waiters.  The food was great, yes I used the coupon, they gave me little takeaway containers of the AWESOME spicy garlic sauce that you can never find in regular grocery stores, etc.  We lacked for nothing.  Climbing the stairs?? This was a critique?  Wow, one flight, nothing excessive. Maybe the tourists aren't used to our SF hills.  \n\nI guess most of these negative reviews were written by tourists and i guess where they have come from might serve chop suey or the like, it's the only reason I can think of as to why they thought the food didn't taste good.

It's true that a good rule of thumb is to stay away from restaurants whoring themselves on the street corner or giving away \"free\" pot stickers, but in this case, is was quite decent if you stick to a couple of ordering guidelines:\n\n1) Stay away from buffet style entres like beef and brocoli or lo mein. Go for chef specials and other oddball dishes like the creamy shrimp or pepper beef. \n\n2) Order the combination meals, like \"the good stuff for five\". Here you're given tastes from all the higher end lower margin dishes. Total meal should be $10 to $20ish per. More than that you're probably going overboard.  \n\n3) Have low expectations and be patient and you will be quite impressed. \n\nAt the end of the day this place was far from the worst reviews I read on this site, even if it wasn't the best I've ever eaten at. No one on party got sick and I would certainly go back. So don't feel bad of you end up here.", "author": "Seth K."}

I went out for a day in the city with my friend and she had been to this place before and said it was pretty good so we decided to go in. From the beginning the lady who was downstairs was rude and just told us to go upstairs. Once at the top we were greeted in a rude manner again. The waitress holding stuff to deliver to a table grabbed two menus and just put them on a table without really saying much. My friend and I sat down, waited really long, we felt forgotten since we were kind of on a corner. \n\nFinally they came to take our drink order and i ordered ginger ale and she ordered punch NO ice. The lady come drops off the drink and her punch has ice and my ginger ale is a can of Safeway brand ginger ale (which they sold for $2) we both were really hungry and decided to order the lunch/dinner for two which came with a big variety of egg rolls, pot sticker, shrimp etc... we also decided to get chow mien. Our pot stickers were ser ved first and then the chow mein came both of which we both ate, it was definitely not the best that I have tasted but we both ate it. \n\nWe continue to eat and at the top our our this bamboo container there was some white ball that seemed to have some sort of meat in the middle. My friend was brave and tasted it first and said she did not know what it was but that it was good. She then put it on her plate and proceeded to eat it. she was not even half way done eating and and she finds a HAIR in the food, not even on top but INSIDE. At this point we were both grossed out and told the waitress which did not know what to say so she called someone else. That lady who seemed to be the manager was just like Oh where is it, tells my friend to put it on the table very rudely and then says its just hair, we are have it, it happens..... we were both looked at each other like wow did she really just say that?!!! They took it back and came back with a new order of those things and we both decided we would like eat those again so we moved that off the top to eat the stuff under it. \n\nMy friend then grabs an egg roll and we start to eat again, on the table there is bottle of sweet and sour sauce and she pours some on her plate, takes a bite of her egg roll and pours more sauce on the plate where she then notices a FLY in the sauce! At this point we are all fed up with this place and call the lady over again and AGAIN she tries to say oh well there are flies around because it has been so hot lately and it probably went through the opening at the top. We then said this is the second this we find in our food and we do not want this food anymore! We told her to take it and that we would only pay for the drinks and chowmein which we finished. She did not seem very happy and just picked up all the food and and left. After a long time of waiting we finally got our check and the total was $10 just for the drinks and reduced price of the chow mein since it was ordered with the special. I put a $20 bill to pay for it and the girls just said Thank you and walked away. We thought she was going to keep the change as her tip and so we waiting until she looked and saw that we were still there waiting, she then came back with the change and we left. We both decided to NEVER go back to that place again! \n\n-THE SERVICE SUCKS! \n- THE FOOD SUCKS! \n- WE FOUND HAIR AND FLIES IN OUR FOOD! \n- ORDER WAS NOT GIVEN CORRECTLY \n-OVERPRICED \n-THE LONG WAIT FOR THINGS WAS UNACCEPTABLE \n\nI will NEVER go back to this place again and I recommend no one else does either! \n\np.s I gave it one star but it does not even deserve that!", "author": "Gardenia T."}

It's rare to see a restaurant stay in one place longer than a generation, at least in my opinion.\n \nI have an idea of why they have been able to remain viable for so long. They have greeters walking up and down Washington Street who invite you in and provide you with a coupon for free pot stickers and 20% off an entree. They also boast Dim Sum from 10 AM to 10 PM.\n\nThe  Location\nGreat location. This is not too far from the BART. They catch anybody just getting into China Town or on the way down to the Hilton. They have a charming little park directly across the street from . This is a prime piece of real estate.\n\nThe Lay Out\nMy pals are afflicted with Tiny Bladder. We were seated on the second floor and the only patron restroom was on the first floor.  They weren't too thrilled to climb the steep stairs for that single purpose. The walls could use a paint job, not because it's old and peeling but because it is not an enticing color. I suggest changing from that shade of yellow to a nice golden color to really make the red accents pop.\n\nThe Service\nIt is definitely rushed and not particularly courteous. During the middle of our order the waitress walked away. Now, it is quite likely that she was once in used car sales.  She could definitely push a menu item. We got the Thai-Style Chicken Wrap.  My friend was extremely disappointed and said, \"she made it sound like it was from heaven.\" I thought I saw a little tear escape from her eye during that lamentation. She was even more distraught after catching errors with our bill.\n\nThe Food\nChicken Feet -- Dry. Chewing off that skin was a chore. Ironically, so were the pot stickers!  I really enjoyed the apple. Although I didn't sample the Honey Spareribs my heart broken friend said they were great.  The pancake was nifty but a little to thick for my tastes.  The crystal chicken dumplings were okay.

Didn't ask for the pork, but very good.\nNo Mai Gai - Sticky rice wrapped in a tea leaf. Very small portion, but quite tasty.\n\nWhen she brought the bill, it was quite a shock as it was $30 for a bowl of soup and a small pad of rice with meat, not more than 6 bites for a $30 bill.  \n\nI feel what made this restaurant unique was their \"Hot Chili Oil\" base for the pot stickers.

WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT!!\n\nSo,\n\n     Like the rest of you,  my girlfriend and I were suckered in by the coupons!  Like the rest of you our dining experience sucked!  For what its worth I have some downtime at work, and was checking out some of the reviews on Yelp regarding this China Town Dump!  So heres our story...\n      Since we originally wanted to go to Shanghai Dumpling King,  which we have been craving since we saw it on Check Please Bay Area,  we never had any intention of ending up at Chinatown Restaurant.  Turns out Shanghai Dumpling King was closed for vacation.  So Plan B was Red Jade,  as also seen on Check Please Bay Area.  But no,  I come up with the brilliant idea to go to Chinatown (district) and just wing it.  Play it by ear and see where we end up.  Well that lasted about 5 minutes from the parked car on Stockton st. to the intersection at Washington where we were harassed by these woman in red chinese dresses.  \n        She rudely bumped my arm and said \"You,  you hungry?\"  Before I could answer she had multiplied into like four woman in red chinese dresses all ushering my girlfriend and I into this shit hole looking restaurant called Chinatown Restaurant.  Now the balcony looked nice,  but the emptiness of the place told me it was a real shit hole.  \n        My girl looked at me and said,  \"This place looks sketchy babe,  lets get outta here\"  But before we could make our escape, the asian version of Hitler was hovering over us,  about to lead us to our table.  She then disappeared for a moment,  only to return, demanding our order.  I guess she was the owner or something.    My chicks face told the story.  It said \" Babe, you stupid Italian man you!  You need to check yourself and get over the free coupon deal and believe me when I say, we need to get the F outta here,  NOW!!!\"\n        So I said,  \"lets give em a chance, it may be good, come on...?\"  As I'm saying this an older caucasian lady behind us began complaining to the waitress / owner that \"Her chicken has got to be the most disgusting that she has ever had!\"  I missed it but once we left my girl was like, \"Babe,  you didn't hear her,  I wish you did!\"  \n        Anyway,   my girl who wanted to escape this torture chamber agreed to give it a try.  She was so shocked by the prices on the menu!  Being a filipina and eating asian cuisine 6 out of 7 days a week,  she knows this stuff.  Me being Italian / sicillian,  I don't.  But I had the whole what if approach...  Like what if it turns out to be good?  What if we really like it?  What if we want to return over and over again?\n      Didn't think about the \"What if we get ripped off?  Which we did.  $28 for an order of Mongolian Beef ($15.95 wtf?),  5 steamed pork dumplings,  and a side of white rice with a coke to drink?  Sure we got the free pot stickers,  which tasted like ka ka,   and the green tea ice cream,  but what happend to 20% off?  \n      Oh I forgot,  many times during our meal my girl kept saying that we should of just left,  despite hitler and her troops of the ripper offers.\nI said,  nah lets just try it,  we can't do that.  We it turns out we could of because we watched a shocked looking couple come in,  sit down,  Get sticker shocked,  and 2 minutes later walk out talking about \"hell nah,  not happening\"   Miss Hitler chasing her screaming \"You no buy you no go!  YOU NO BUY YOU NO GO!!  HEY!!\"  Hella funny!  So we should a left...\n\n       So I give this review no stars.  But Yelp won't let me so I give it one star by default,  but again it deserves zero stars!  Place is a joke.  Food is blah blah.

I never had Dim Sum before but what they served is nothing like what the pictures say about. It was small in portions, looks bland and stale, and when I ate it, it lacks in flavor and taste and I was not happy with it. I am an avid Chinese food fan but this place isn't even authentic Chinese cuisine and most of the clientele were tourists being victims of this scam that I call it a \"restaurant\".

I was happy with everything I ate here and ate it twice, we came back 2 days later and ate the same thing, mom had something else and the second time the kids ate here to and were very pleased.  The food was delicious and all the meat in our dishes was very good.  Nothing was rubbery which I find occurs way too often in the Chinese food that I've been eating in New York.  The dumplings were out of this world! We had bbq pork buns and steamed pork dumplings (which were even better the second time!!) the free potstickers that someone else mentioned in another review as really horrible were really delicious chicken potstickers.  I'm really picky about my chicken and the texture of it and found the chicken in my chicken and vegetables to be very good and a very nice non-rubbery texture.  My mom was also very pleased with the food that she ate here... I can't remember what she had the first time but the second time she had Mongolian beef which was very spicy, but the beef was very nice and tender.  \nI am definitely keeping this place in mind for my next visit and I'm hoping that I'll get a coupon! Maybe it's not the cheapest or friendliest Chinese joint in Chinatown but it was worth my whole family enjoying their meals!  Eat here instead of that absolutely horrible tourist trap the Empress of China! More on that later!", "author": "Betty T."}

After going up the stairs, I was shocked to see all the patrons there were all non-Chinese.  My hunch is that they were all tourists that were suckered in like myself with the great FREE word on the ads.\n\nAnyway the food was great for the portions.  It's definitely the Americanized Chinese style food that we all have adapted to that we've ordered.  As for the flavor, it was so-so.  The Mongolian beef was very tangy and the Kung Pao chicken had it's extra kick as always.  The dim sum comes via the kitchen and not the carts, no biggie for us.\n\nThe part that surprised us the most was the amount of free items we were given.  It was beyond the items listed in the coupon.  We were given free iced Thai tea, three plates of pot stickers, green tea ice cream, and a large bowl of rice.  On top of that was the 20% discount!

But there are really not that many restaurants open in Chinatown at 10:30am Friday mornings, so we just picked the first one we saw :(  \n\nI liked the fact that there was outdoor seating.  The restaurant is on the 2nd floor and even though the ledge was really narrow and seemed precarious, it was actually pretty solid.  AND there was somehow no bird poop on our ledge even though the awning on the next building over was completely covered in bird poop.  Impressive.  So enjoying the beautiful weather and people-watching was nice...  But when we saw the lady who greeted us in the restaurant walking out to the corner to hand out restaurant flyers to tourists while pointing them in the direction of the restaurant, that's when we knew we were in trouble :P\n\nThe food took FOREVER to come out even though we were the only ones in the restaurant.  The dumpling skins and the bread for the pork buns weren't very fresh.  The xiao long baos had kind of a clear gelatinous substance in them that was strange..  It tasted OK but the jelly-like stuff was just weird.  The spare ribs were nice and meaty but the black bean flavor somehow didn't quite get into the meat..  And my water glass had a strange sticky pinkish blob on the inside - a tiny blob, but still a blob :P\n\nFortunately the refreshing pistachio ice cream and the fresh crunchy fortune cookie at the end were delicious.

I found the waitstaff to be very attentive, not overbearing as some posts have mentioned. As I was traveling by myself, I did not opt for the Dim Sum (although there were a lot of interesting choices), but could not decide what I wanted. The waitress suggested a combo dinner - it's  usually for 2, but she said they could do a single-serving version for me.\n\nThe food came out hot and fairly quickly. Some of the appetizers were from the Dim Sum menu - shrimp shumai (nice chunks of shrimp) in a steamer basket, chicken pot stickers, the egg roll & fired prawn were crispy fried but not greasy. Got talked into Hot & Sour soup (not part of the combo, but a weakness of mine) which was very good & a large portion. Couldn't finish the entree (Mongolian beef & very spicy Kung Pao shrimp & chicken dish), so ended up taking that with me.\n\nLove the green tea ice cream at the end - it made for a nice finish.

But today at dinner we discovered two things that completely ruined this restaurant for us. The first is that they serve shark fin soup and dumplings. Considering shark fins are gathered by cutting fins off of live sharks in the wild and then tossing the sharks back in the ocean to die, I am not interested in supporting an establishment that supports that appalling practice. Secondly, we noticed a mysterious charge on the bill for $6.50. The notation next to it was just a scribble, and it was added at the end very discretely. We asked what that charge was, and we were told it was a 'service charge' (tip). We were a party of 2. I told her we didn't want to have that charge added, and she said that we didn't have to pay it. If we hadn't noticed that added fee, we likely would have paid it AND tipped on top of that.

Thus, you can only imagine how high my expectations were when I walked into Chinatown Restaurant. There were inauspicious signs everywhere, warning me to stay away from the place, but the rumbly in my tumbly had full control of my mind, body, and soul. Perhaps it was the name of the restaurant itself that should have warded me off from entering (\"Chinatown Restaurant\"?!?! Come on! Can you get any less creative than that? You're better off calling it \"Ching Chong Restaurant\". ) And then of course, there was that lady dressed in a qipao, handing out coupons (when the hell did Chinese people offer COUPONS?) for free pot stickers, a free scoop of green tea ice cream, and 20% off your total bill with a $20 purchase. That alone should have had me bee-line the hell out of there. But no, I walked in there like a happy-go-lucky kid on her first day of school, all wide-eyed and bushy tailed.\n\nSo we headed upstairs and well, the first thing I noticed was uh...the lack of Asians in presence, other than the wait staff. Folks, not to be racist or anything, but if you don't see any elderly people of Asian decent in a \"dim sum\" restaurant, GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE. Senior citizens of the Asian community pride themselves in being able to just \"chillax\" at their favorite dim sum place, while kicking back and reminiscing about the \"good old days\" over a nice steaming cup of oolong tea for hours and hours. There was none of that going on. All I saw were a bunch of yuppie tourists, drinking their tea with their pinkie finger extended.\n\nNonetheless, we decided to cut the restaurant some slack. We were in the heart of a giant tourist trap, after all. So we sit down, and the hostess hands us a menu. Yes, a MENU. And that's when I realized there were no goddamn carts in sight. For as long as I could remember, all dim sum places have loud-mouthed, but smiling, Asian ladies pushing carts (filled with steaming hot dim sum!!!) around. But alas, that never happened, and we had to resort to ordering from the menu. (I felt so dirty doing it...) We only ordered three dishes (hargao, shumai, and chicken feet) because we felt a little obligated to at least give the food the benefit of a doubt. Half an hour later and there was no food in sight. And, not only was I suffering from malnutrition, but dehydration as well, as I was out of oolong tea and no one came to replenish our empty teapot. We decided to call the hostess over and inquired about our lack of edible goodness. She snapped at us and said, \"This is not a cart service restaurant. You can't expect food to come out that fast. We make everything fresh in our kitchen!\" Well, my thoughts on that comment was, \"I'm sorry, lady. But where I come from, if you give me that kind of attitude, I would open up a can of whoop-ass on you.\" But I held my tongue and decided to wait a while longer - patience is a virtue, after all.\n\nFifteen minutes later and the hargao (shrimp dumplings) came out. To say it was pathetic would be an understatement. I would have had a more enjoyable meal had I purchased it on the frozen food aisle at 99 Ranch Market...or even got it from Costco. The shrimp was not fresh - it looked and tasted like something you got from a pre-cooked frozen bag of shrimp from a private label company. Well, that was the last straw for us and we decided to ask for the check. The last two dishes were taking too long and I still didn't get my tea. The hostess tried to talk to us out of leaving, but it was too late. I politely declined and asked for the check. She leaves and comes back with the two other dishes, which was oh-so-conveniently prepared just as we was ready to leave. We asked her to take it back to the kitchen - we were done. She brings the shumai and chicken feet back to the kitchen, and brings us the check...and two scoops of green tea ice cream. We ignore the ice cream and looked at the check - $20, plus 20% gratuity. Four pieces of crappy shrimp with a stupid rice wrapping for $20? That's highway robbery. After 20 minutes of arguing with the hostess over the bill, I decided to just walk out, leaving them a $10.

My dad politely told the waitress that as a part of principle they can't legally overcharge his credit card for the amount w/ their tip *without his signature,* he will tip his own amout and write it on the reciept and the first words out of the waiter's mouth is \"we cannot validate your parking anymore!\" \"we cannot do anything\"\n\nwtf? There was *nothing* about a gratuity charge (more about that later) or tip in any of the menu papers. How shady.\n\nGet this: the table on our left were some Euro-tourists,from Britain,  and earlier I heard them say something about a 25% tip \"must be a gratuity charge David\" Haha, yea right, a grautity charge for two people? come on people. \n\nBasically, they charge you different amounts depending on whether you are foreign or not, bc they figure you might not understand american customs so they can get away with a 25% tip for extremely shoddy service (plates took 40 min to come, had to ask for water, tea, servers borderline rude), charged us $3 for water?\n\nThe food is definitely 2 stars, akin to Panda express but 3x more expensive. for a $28 dish simple spicy fried chicken dish we got 7 quarter sized medallions of chicken. What a ripoff.\n\nThis place feed off of lots of advertising, good looking interior, and good location (next to the presidio parking sturcture and claims of validating parking). Also, the pictures on the wall they are so proud of that supposedly tell the story of the owner's family's journey from china to america is probably just an enlargement of something they got off a history book. \n\nMy sister was upset at the waiter for talking so rude to my father , so she took the teapot from our table and poured it onto the plates. We were in the corner so nobody really cared to watch. That same waiter must have taken a hell of a time to carry those plates back!\nMy father was scolding my sister on the way out of the restaurant until he realized that the waiter had REALLY overcharged us for a 22% unauthorized tips.

MiL was upset... but hey we're in the middle of Frisco Chinatown so there's a myriad of places to eat. We walk down Washington- MiL was eyeing  Grant Palace or somethiong like that when we were  acosted by a young lady in red passing out coupons... she then \"escorted\" us to the Chinatown Restaraunt- even stopping traffic in the middle of Washington so we could jay walk to the restaraunt. Ok whatever, lets do this.\n\nWe sit a t a round table and while looking at the menu, are told we shoul\\d REALLY go with the special menu priced at $15.95 but \"on special\" for $11.95 per person. We had 4 adults three kids. Yeah... best to go this route.The young man taking drink orders was a punk-- slamming menus around tossing straws here and there and just being plain rude. Service was OK after that. Food was about what I could get from your typical donut and Chinese food place you find in any 'hood. Nothing special. Kung Pao chicken had no taste (maybe becuase their were kids, they didn't spice it up). For seven people, the rice wasn't nearly enough. Overall, you get a lot of food (besides the rice). However, there are no highlights here. This place is geared to  non discriminiating tourists.

Fearing for our lives (the dining room is on the upper level and we were worried we wouldn't get out unscathed), I successfully argued the amount down with an incredibly insulting woman who had come out and surreptitiously removed our coupon halfway through the meal, and responded to my growing outrage with complete disrespect.  (She actually tried to convince me that dim sum comes *after* a meal... ) Even if there had been a misunderstanding (we thought, because we had inquired, that the rice, soup and tea came with the entree - I guess our server didn't speak English well?) even if we added what they said those things cost to the bill it *still * didn't come to the ridiculous total.

It is almost impossible to find a restaurant in Chinatown that serves bad food, but it happens at the Chinatown restaurant.  I was not so excited about going to this place, but my BF was really excited about dining on the porch.  I don't know if it is legal to sit on the porch though...  Anyway, it took us almost 2 hours to finish a 4-dish dinner.  The dishes were served in 30-minute interval.  Go figure... \n\n\nWhen we were having our 2nd dish, we over heard the patrons who sat next to us asking for their last dish.  Apparently their last dish never arrived, but they were given the bill for a dish that they never had.  Then the same thing happen to us.  I was waiting for the honey BBQ ribs.  Sure enough, before we got our dish, we got our bill.  When the BBQ ribs finally arrived, they didn't look very good. The meat was very chewy...  I was not happy with the service and food...  We paid our bill and were ready to leave the restaurant.  We ran into a patron who was complaining to the waitress that he still had not got the sake that he ordered an hour ago.  My BF and I looked at each other and then decided to chat with this gentleman.  We never learned the name of this gentleman.  Anyway, we shared our story at the restaurant with this guy and he invited us back to his table to drink with his friends who were sitting on the other side of the porch facing Washington St.  Then we started talking to another 2 patrons who sat right next to the gentleman and his friends.  It turned out that it took FOREVER for them to get their dishes as well.  They were still waiting for the Mongolian Beef when we talked to them.  A patron at another table said that the waitress got their order wrong...  What's up with the restaurant that keeps on messing up people's orders???\n\n\nDespite the dining disaster, it turned out to be a weird kind of fun experience that my BF and I would always remember and talk about.

Should have checked yelp, now that I see the HORRIBLE reviews. We were seated right away, and although we were in chinatown, there were no chinese people eating there. That is probably a bad sign, since that never happens. They had a dim sum special, which was $16 per person, and we each added soup, because we were freezing to death, so that upped the price. The dim sum that came was not that good. It wasn't horrible or anything, just not special. Very bland. There wasn't a ton of it either. The dinner ended with green tea ice cream, which was good, in styrofoam bowls (ew). I was almost too freezing to eat it, since it was still cold in the restaurant. Service was good, and the waitress was able to answer our question of whether there were nuts in the meal, which has been an issue in the past in eating at chinese restaurants (since we both have nut allergies and have had allergic reactions before, due to the language barrier). The bill ended up coming to $40ish for two people, which wouldn't be a lot in a normal place, but for cheap tasting bland not great chinese food, it was. I do not recommend anyone going there.", "author": "Merredith L."}

So we walked a bit more and were looking for somewhere else to eat, when we encountered the flyer ladies. I thought the coupons sounded like a nice deal. You got a free order of potstickers, green tea icecream, and a discount off of your entree, I believe. So I figured that this must be serendipity and decided to go along with it. It's not the best chinese food I've tasted. My sweet and sour chicken tasted a little more like orange chicken than sweet and sour, but it was still yummy. And my friend's chow mein tasted good too. The prices were neither cheap nor overly expensive, and they had a decent selection of entrees and dim sum. I ordered the bbq pork buns (okay) and the shrimp dumplings (pretty yummy), and my friend ordered some curry chicken skewers, which weren't at all spicy, but tasted good. Portions were big enough to fill us up, but not so big that we had to box them up, which was just fine with me because we still had more sightseeing to do. The wait staff was not lacking anything that I noticed, and everything went perfectly fine as far as I was concerned. I don't know if I'd go there again, but I was perfectly satisfied with my meal, and happy that we ended up in a decent restaurant.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

I'll tell you why, they had sent out the ladies out passing flyers for free potstickers, and 20% off entrees.  Wrong!  We ordered some beef ribs for appetizers.  Guess what, the entrees came first before the appetizer.  We ordered one dish and one appetizer, in addtion with the free potstickers. Well, the manager said, you need to ordered two entree, because the entree is small.  I said, I am a really small eater.  I just have two bites and I'm done. So I ended getting beef and tender greens, and my honey ordered sweet and sour pork.  So, okay...they charged hella expensive, for very small portions.  I mean, really small.  The first entree arrived, the sweet and sour pork.. My entree hasnt even arrived until 10 minutes later.  I was like, where is the rice that we ordered.  I always have rice with my entree, so I asked the waitress that we had ordered rice, well....apparrently, they forgot to bring the rice, at least five minutes later, after I called them out on it.  Another thing that bother me was the fact that after the two entrees have came out, we were starting to think our appetizer wasnt going to come,  Finally, it came after we finished our entree.  I was like WTF.  Okay, they gave us the check.  Okay, their big promotion was 20% on all entrees.  WRONG!  She must think I am some dumb stupid tourist.  I read the bill from top to bottom.  When I saw that 20% wasnt deducted, I called the manager, and she fixed it.  When I gave my card to another lady, she charged the same price without the discount.  I was like, this is a sham.  These people must think we are pretty stupid to not noticed what they are doing.  I noticed that 90% of the customers are tourist, and sometimes when you travel, you dont noticed these little things.  But, for god sake, that's not how you run a business.  Again, I went to the manager, and she didnt want to redo the whole bill.  She felt it was a hassle to print up a new receipt. She said, well..you dont have to pay the tip.  A five dollar tip, for lousy service.  My boyfriend was like \"I aint paying five dollar for tip\".  It was really stupid all the way around.  They never came to check to see if we like our food, and the sneaky way about getting customers in, and not giving them the discount sounds so conviving to me.

My boyfriend, who is Chinese, told me that the food was great, in his opinion.  (Of course, he also loves Panda Express...)  I ordered sesame tofu.  My entree cost $11.95 and was the only item that the infamous 20% coupon applied to, for some odd reason that our server could not explain to us.  Anyway, the tofu was tasty, but it was literally just a huge plate of steamed sesame tofu - about 30 pieces of tofu!  I was hoping for some rice or veggies, but I guess that's asking too much.  :oP  I couldn't eat the free potstickers, which were filled with chicken.  The green tea ice cream was good, I'm told, but I had to pass on that too.  Service was alright.

When the bill came, we realized why. Over $40 and all in Chinese so we couldn't decipher it. We could figure out that the food was $32, and our drinks totaled $9. The 20% off was MAYBE applied - when you read the fine print you will see it is only on select entrees, so who knows if we qualified? I think she kept the menu so we couldn't recheck the prices - at around $5 per dim sum dish, it just didn't add up!

Go for it in case you are tired of \"suspiciously\" friendly waiters, who bring out your food in a regular boring order: drinks, app-zers, soup, salad, entre, dessert. The place is an experience. Unlucky enough to come across the lady with flyers, we found ourselves in a \"living room\" of the Chinatown restaurant. There were huge tables with piles of dirty dishes that remained untouched up until when we left, frustrated guests waiting for their food. There were 2 huge and very observable garbage bins next to the kitchen and very close to the dining room. Their restroom, two floors down, would be a scary site for a susceptible person. When we sat at one of the dirty tables, a woman started putting huge sheets of paper to cover the mess. Then there came a waitress that was very pushy when taking our order and took our 20% off flyers. First, we got our lukewarm pot stickers with a burnt chili flakes souse. Then we received our sesame chicken made of chicken tenders, breading, an ultra-sweet souse and a pound of raw sesame seeds. Then there came rice, about 10 minutes later, mixed with peas of acid-green color and the remains of an omelet (I wondered if they served breakfasts as well). A few minutes later I received my seafood plate, which was quite good, but for the fact that it lacked 2 out of the 4 seafood ingredients. The food was brought to us by one of the cooks and the only time we saw the waitress was when she took our order. We were impatient to pay and go, but the check made us stay for quite a while. The prices were very high generally, but such mediocre food and horrible experience on their own should have been a bonus. The check contained hieroglyphs and numbers and we figured we had to pay for both rice and the tea as well which turned out to be rather expensive. The gratuity was included in the bill. My boyfriend and I have worked as servers for quite a while and have been in quite a few restaurants, so we know from our experience that gratuity is sometimes included for big parties OR some UPSCALE restaurants include \"suggested gratuity\" into the checks. Needless to say, we also had to ask for the discount (it was not taken off as with other 2 tables that paid at the same time) after the waitress has picked up at least 4 coupons from our table (I made sure to grab them twice&#61514;).
