There's like three or four restaurant to each side of this restuarant, guess this place was special? Who knows..\n\nI got there early so I sat inside to wait for my grandparents, inside wasn't full, half the tables were full. Once my grandparents arrived we head to the inner area which had more tables, and again less than half the tables had people.\n\nWe order the usual and felt the foods were meh, nothing special, common food like most of the restuarant in chinatown. We ordered shui mai, shrimp rice roll, fried donut roll, shrimp dumpling and some more that I forgot what it was. We also ordered a fried vermicelli dish that had way too much oil, it did tastes good but just too much oil.\n\nOverall, price is okay, nothing popped for the food. Could have chosen some other restuarant, maybe tried out the Begoni Bistro.", "author": "Jen M."}

Chinese people love fresh seafood, so my mom asked them if they would steam a live fish that she had purchased in Chinatown elsewhere and had cleaned. They said yes and charged us $10 for it. Apparently, Begoni down the street does it for $15. The fish turned out perfectly steamed with soy, scallions, ginger and cilantro (traditional preparation).  We also had giant clams (very fresh but not much meat), hot and sour soup (a little bland), garlic snow pea shoots (vines were too mature so kind of tough and too oily), shrimp with bok choi (kind of boring and shrimp were too salty), longevity noodles (just right), and salt and pepper pork (not enough salt). Overall, food was mediocre but service was great.\n\nIf you come for dinner and if there is no car parked in their loading zone, you can ask the owner if you can park there even if there is a cone there. They won't tow or ticket you and you save yourself some headache of trying to find a parking spot in Chinatown!", "author": "Jeff K."}

Walking around mid-day, you get famished and want some really good Dim Sum.  \n\nPassing restaurants by restaurants and even some people passing out menus and flyers at the corner of the streets inviting patrons to their place.  One place was a 100+ year old restaurant.  Lots of choices but so many bad reviews for most of them.  I went into a more modern and busy place and I basically walked out after hygiene was a serious issue - I witness things...I saw things...things I can never un-see!  Brrrr.....!\n\nEnded up at Peninsula and ordered a bunch of my old favourites.  HaGow, SuiMai, ChunFun, Meat Balls...so good to get good old cantonese DimSum.  I don't mind the dumpling and all that XLB stuff, but it's good to get things I grew up on.  My Cali-Friend finally got to have the ChunFun.  Never had it, always wanted to try.\n\nThis is a standard spot.  You know.  Walk in and get a tiny piece of paper and wait.  Finally a person screams out in a language that I don't understand but I kind of know numbers.  It's like...Bingo!  You jump out and eagerly walk to a table you know has worn out seating and question the cleanliness of the worn out carpet.  But you turn a blind-eye to it cause you're gonna get some FUD!  The place is actually larger than it looks.  The front is small but as you walk towards the back, it opens up to a larger seating area.\n\nFood was average.  Nothing to jump up and down.  What you get out of the whole thing is you ate dinner in historic Chinatown in SanFran. \nNeed a lot more than that for me to return to this place as again, so many places to try.\n\nCheers.", "author": "Peter M."}

Like I  said previously, this place cater to the local clientele and for some (non Cantonese/non-mandarin speakers) there may be a language barrier that affects your experience. It's not a fancy place and honestly it reflects the service style of most Asian establishments. \n\nPeninsula seafood excels with their dim sum dishes in the AM and if you're able to come with a friend that speaks Cantonese and/or knowns Cantonese cuisine in the evening, you're able to get a great dinner with delectable seafood dishes at night, family style.  They are great with their giant steam clams, fresh steamed fish, clay pot rice, and an assortment of peppered flavor pork ribs. Etc. One dish we love is their egg battered, peppered crab similar to the ones at R&g lounge. Of a note, all seafood items (ie. Fish/crab/lobster) are priced by the lb. this is consistent with most establishments so be mindful when you order. \n\nFor dim sum the standard hai gow and shu mai are made perfectly. I've heard they have amazing clay pot Rice and their egg tarts are on par. Like all dim sum restaurants you're charged the standard fee /person for tea. I noticed some reviews mentioning that. Let's be real, ALL dim sum restaurants do this..even your beloved Koi palace in Daly City. \n\nSo if you don't mind the language barrier and diving into something new. This is your place. Be nice. Be courteous and research ahead which canto dish you want. They're likely have the standard Americanized Chinese dishes like beef and broccoli, sweet and sour pork, general Tso chicken as well haha. I know since my brother and I order those dishes as second generation Asian Americans.", "author": "Diane T."}

Took a long time for someone even acknowledge us at the table. A lady passed by with a cart with dumplings and basically forced us to pick one. She kept just pointing to the menu saying something in cantonese. We thought maybe it was included in our lunch so accepted. They were actually really good. \n Once the waiter came over to ask us what we wanted, we ordered the sea bass steamed, house special rice, and general chicken. The waiter brought over a nice looking fish. Said it was 2 pounds. We accepted. The prices for that were obviously not posted on the menu for the fish. The waiter then came back and starting writing on the back of our ticket. Put down the prices of the 3 dishes. I understood $50 total. I thought no problem. It was $50 just for the fish!!!  Sea bass. Not Lobster. Then when we go the final bill it came out to $101 for lunch. I asked the waiter to explain. $2 per person just to sit at the table. $1 for a glass of water per person, and the waiter felt the liberty to include his tip as well. Probably hoping we would not notice and give him more. When I asked to see the fine writing for these fees, he asked if we were tourists. Like it was ok to rip off tourists. I didnt leave him a tip for being sneaky and I am positive the fish did not cost that much. I could understand charging a fee for the table if we just bought tea or something.

The first thing I noticed was that I was the only non-Asian in the restaurant, to me, this was a very good sign! I was excited, it was like leaving San Fransisco and traveling to another country!  When I go out to a restaurant I want to eat authentic, regional, food, but also I go for the experience. Sometimes food is good, sometimes not so good, but I judge restaurants on the overall experience, and for this, I rate Peninsular highly.  The customers were a cross-section of society,  old and young ranging from retirees and young families to very smart business people. The fact that the restaurant probably had about 80 to 100 customers at that time of the morning says more than any review!!  The casual and comfortable way they were relaxing in the place made me think, they probably return time and time again, they must have been regulars, and would soon stop coming if the food wasn't very authentic, good and prepared and served in a way that is appropriate to the style and custom. My food was fresh, hot and delicious. When I tried to compliment the waiter as I left, and she clearly had no idea what I had said added to the charm of the whole experience.

After a 20 minute wait, we ordered the Peninsula Pan Fried Noodle and Mongolian Beef lunch special w/hot & sour soup.\n\nTo me, the Pan Fried Noodles is almost perfect though saltier than I would have liked and the Mongolian Beef was perfectly spiced and beef certainly did not feel tenderized for a stir fry like it usually is in other Cantonese Restaurants.\n\nAlthough the Dim Sum ladies coming to you and sometimes asking you if you want their offerings can be annoying I was surprised they didn't have push carts which I actually miss seeing. They also brought someone else's order to my table by mistake twice. We also didn't order tea but they brought it over and charged us the $1 per person. Interestingly it is advertised as $0.50 but the boss explained that certain teas are $1. I guess she can say whatever she wants when adding up the bill-way to rip you off.\n\nThough they don't rush you and we were there for about 2 hours, the boss lady has to make it a point to charge extra and try to justify why she did so in a demeaning way. They do offer free WiFi. So that's my 2 stars for them.", "author": "Alex H."}

We were randomly strolling through Chinatown, and went to a couple of different restaurants that were rated well, only to find that they were either closed on Wednesday, or not open for whatever reason.  Finally, our hunger took control, and we were guided to the biggest sign in view...  Peninsula Seafood Restaurant.  As we walked in the place felt very authentic.  Tables were filled with Asian locals, and it appeared we were the only tourists in the joint.  We sampled one Dim Sum dish, which was pork ribs and some kind of thick noodle.  It was very good, and the meat tasted good, but there was more bone than meat (which is fine, I guess).  We then ordered Spring Rolls and Potstickters, and when they came, I enjoyed them both.  Things were kind of greasy (as if that is a bad thing), but I thought everything was tasty.  This was so for my wife, who didn't care for things too much.  Still, it was a fun experience to eat in an establishment that obviously caters to the locals, and experience things a little bit out of the box from the typical Americanized Chinese food that we are used to.  I don't know if I'd really recommend it to anyone visiting SF, but I'm sure we will be back in the hunt tonight to find something better.\n\n\n[  I'd tell you a chemistry joke but I'm pretty sure I wouldn't get a reaction.  ]", "author": "Michael S."}

Came here for breakfast dim sum on MONDAY and since it was the one we know it opened early for see so we came again. It was already filled by 9AM since it was the weekend. All the seats in the outer parts were filled so we went inside where it was empty but not for long. We basically sat ourselves because did I say, service is basically shit here. Anyways sat down for two minutes and the waiter(this rude one I'm about to talk about) gave us our tea. Five minutes later he gives us the sheet to decide what dim sum we want to order and keep in mind the menu does not have pictures which is so inconvenient. Ordered about 8-10 plates(they're tiny btw) for total of three people. When I have him the paper, he swung the paper so quick on the table and came down frustrated saying \"Are you sure you wanna order that much, not even eight people order this much. Cuz when we bring the food you can't say you don't want it.\" Exactly what he freaking said in Chinese. So I look over it again and I know the dishes are small so of course I kept what I want.

The line definitely moves, but be ready for a wait. All in all, nothing fancy, nothing terrible. Just a run of the mill 3 star dim sum place in the Bay Area.\n\nQUALITY\nNothing to rail on, but certainly nothing to write home about. I'd say it's right about middle of the road: your average dim sum place with a few dishes hitting a little below the line. I didn't try any of their regular dishes, so I won't say anything about those. \n\nSERVICE\nI'd say coming to Peninsula will leave you with a fairly authentic Chinese dining experience. Really loud servers running around crowded tables of even louder patrons. They didn't have the dim sum pushcarts around, which I attribute to the relatively cramped seating arrangements they have, so you have to order most of your dim sum items from the menu. Unfortunately, it takes quite a long time for them to bring the food out. My girlfriend had to flag someone down twice to make sure they didn't forget our food. They do have attendants walking around with platters with some of the more popular dim sum items though, so you won't have to wait there.\n\nFINAL TAKE\nIt's alright dim sum.

By the time we arrived at the place we intended to get food from (which was closed), we were hungry and tired, so decided to just eat at the first half-decent-looking place we saw that had dim sum, which turned out to be here. \n\nWell, yelp was right on the money: 3 stars indeed. It looked good from the start, in that we were the only non-Asian-looking people sitting down for dinner, which is generally a good sign, as is a waiter asking us what we wanted almost immediately. Less of a good sign was the fact that when we had decided, they explained (in broken English, of course, but that's expected) that they were out of like a third of the dim sum on the menu, even though it was specifically a dinner menu and it was only like 6:30 - though, he later came back and told us that actually the item we'd tried to order that he said was out, actually *wasn't* out and did we want to order it? \n\nGood thing we did, too, as that item (the beef rice noodle roll) was the highlight of the dinner: it was extremely good. The scallops with spicy garlic sauce was also extremely good (I'd say even given its price - scallops are expensive, and they do give you a decent number of them); the mongolian beef, I've had better, but it wasn't bad. The pork spare ribs, on the other hand, were disgusting: they were almost entirely bone and gristle (maybe this is how authentic Chinese food lovers like it? I can't imagine.) We took one bite, and threw the rest away (actually, we tried to leave it on the table, but they wouldn't let us. Hilariously, they really thought we wanted it to go, and when we left the togo box on the table, they chased us out with it, so we just had to leave it on a trash can outside.) And the third dim sum item we ordered never showed up: apparently they ran out of that one, and didn't think to tell us until we asked about it as we were ready to leave. They asked if we wanted something else instead, but at that point we were perfectly happy to leave. At least they didn't still charge us for the item, as I've seen happen sometimes.\n\nSo basically, exactly what you would expect from a place that has 3 stars on yelp: some food good, some food not so good, some aspects of service good, some aspects of service not so good. I wouldn't be angered if a friend wanted to go here again, but I might encourage the thought of going somewhere else instead.\n\nedit: I will mention, their hot sauce on the table was super tasty too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-13", "description": "Famished is a word that I rarely use, but I was feeling somewhat that on this particular day as a medical appointment and a series of errands left my stomach growling to be fed.  Having to fast for 12 hours prior to the appointment didn't help either as my tank was nearing zero.\n\nNot having experienced much dining out in the Chinatown area and too lazy to reach for my phone and ask Yelp for help, I came upon this restaurant.  My memory usually serves me well, and I recalled having read some decent reviews about this place when they opened.\n\nI was greeted as soon as I walked in and a table for two was quickly cleaned and reset for me by a waiter.  Asked by the gentleman who seated me whether I was interested in their regular lunch menu or dim sum menu I chose the latter not having that for several weeks.\n\nThe dim sum menu came in the form of two check off lists and a pencil.  I truly enjoy this method of ordering over the old fashioned push cart method.  I selected several choices and handed the list back to the gentleman when he came by to ask whether I had completed my order.  I'm assuming the man that helped me is either a manager or even a part owner of the restaurant as I noticed him make a gesture to a waiter who immediately brought me a hot pot of tea.\n\nThe man returned once again to inform me that the dim sum would be steamed to order so I should expect a bit of the wait.  That was fine with me as the hot tea had helped to numb my belly.\n\nOnce the food began to arrive they came out in two separate waves.  That was perfect for it gave me the chance to eliminate some of the dishes quicker to make room for others.  \n\nThe Shrimp Dumpling (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#hh0YZIRmSb5q4N8u1pKptQ) was loaded with firm chunks of shrimp, but I detected MSG and lots of it.  The Pork & Mushroom Dumplings (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#0P9T525tP6KWZOyPCeQx0g) were much better.  The amount of shrimp was the showcase in these bites much more than the pork or the mushroom.  Better yet that I couldn't detect MSG in these.  The Bean Curd Sheet with Oyster Sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#Aj2uEe9TVMP_Q8KVqEq-Hg) turned out to be my favorite generously stuffed with ground pork, more shrimp and vegetables (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#ZZIa1-WECQfuXXK-i90IMA).  For some reason the kitchen was too lazy to reheat the Potstickers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#tx6seZ8N-PapcV5whvi0Fw) obviously pre-cooked and served cold and chewy; otherwise, round one was a hit.\n\nRound two turned out to be a mix.  The steamed Mushroom & Chicken Bun had very little chicken and mushroom (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#RijC6cOyniiGuYeNN-1oYA) which might have been a blessing for it was extremely dry.  I much preferred having just the steamed bun portion on its own.  The Sesame Puffs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/8zVnG-g4dRNQtheaTv6t1Q#NdfbT7r4G02MYKUlTChZ6A), at the least, were served hot from the fryer.  I loved those especially with its generous pocket of red bean paste inside.\n\nWhen the man returned to see how I was doing I think he was shocked that I had eaten almost everything brought out to me.  I asked for a small box for my two sesame puffs and one steamed bun and asked the waiter to discard the potstickers.\n\nSome hits and some misses but very good service made for a rather enjoyable lunch.  At least my stomach was happy.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

I grew up in Chinatown so I'm pretty choosy when it comes to picking a Chinese restaurant.  I avoid those that are tailored to tourists since they are generally much more expensive and quality is often mediocre at best.  I also avoid those that are visited by big-name politicians since those are often the biggest rip off.  \n\nWhile the service you get at Peninsula is dismal at best, the food and value is really good.  You cannot find a better value dim sum restaurant for the price in SF Chinatown.  When you are there, you can be adventurous and try out some of the more exotic dishes like chicken feet (Phoenix Claws is the fancy name we use), pig's blood and pork skin (coagulated pig blood), and pig's intestines.  Or you can stick to the more traditional dim sum like Har Gow (shrimp dumpling), Siu Mai (pork dumpling), Cha Siu Bau (BBQ pork buns), and my personal favorite, Beef Cheung Fun (fat rice noodles with beef).  One dessert that this place makes that is really good is the Malay Sponge Cake.  It's called Ma Lai Go if you want to ask for it.\n\nI brought a group of 12 people for dim sum and we walked out spending only $75 including tips and there were still a lot of leftover dim sum.  So, you will enjoy some good authentic dim sum at this place without breaking your bank.\n\nWhen you are there, try some authentic Chinese tea also.  The dark tea (Po Lay) really helps with digestion and washing down the grease from the food.  Just ask for \"Po Lay Cha\" when the waiter comes around.  If you prefer a less bitter tea, try the \"Sau Mei Cha\".  It's not as strong as Po Lay and do help with digestion as well.  Now you're ready to eat like a local!", "author": "Jon L."}

The meat was cooked perfectly with a nice crispy skin. We then ordered Pork fried rice, broccoli with oyster sauce, garlic pork chops and sweet and sour pork. Each dish was prepared very well.

The food here is really good and tasty; you only saw Chinese people here, which is a really good sign.  However, the service here is ridiculously slow.  Like snail's pace slow.  I could ave sent mail Priority Mail faster than this.  WE came here for dim sum, and unlike other dim sum places where they push the carts around, the servers here actually come around with the dishes on trays.  not very efficient.  And to add to that, they put us in the way back corner, so we hardly saw anyone pass by.   \n\nThey have you order what you want with a list also, but we still didn't see our food after that.  We had to tell the server that if they can't serve us what we ordered, we'll just leave and go elsewhere.  There was one server who was very nice and tried her best to accommodate to us, but the rest were not helpful at all.  They were very good about water and tea refills though (I think it's because the bussers handle this job). \n\nWe ordered shu mai, which tasted pretty good, and hacao, which was REALLY good (impressive for a restaurant of this caliber).  We also ordered these rice rolls with shrimps, which were very tasty, and bok choi, which was also good.  The stuffed mushrooms were ok, the egg rolls were yummy, and there was this one item I thought was an egg roll that tasted pretty gross.  It looked like a fuzzy egg roll, but instead of meat in it, it had taro or something.  I had asked the server if it was egg roll and like many Chinese who can't understand English, she nodded yes anyway.  No...that was NOT an egg roll.  Far from it!  I didn't like it at all.  This was a day I wish I spoke Mandarin.   \n\nTo add to that, they had a Yelp check-in offer for a free egg roll that was not even honored.  No one knew about it or couldn't speak English, and it seemed like even the manager didn't even know what was up.  Dudes, if you won't honor the damn check-in offer, don't even offer it.

Though there are a billion restaurants in Chinatown, this was one of the only ones we found open at 9:20PM- they actually close at 9:30 but didn't mind us coming in and were helpful throughout our visit, even though we didn't leave until just after 10. They were moving furniture around and cleaning up for the last few minutes of our visit, which we did not mind.\n\nAs we were seated, got a hot pot of tea- green, I think it was. Good thing we did, too, because we were seated right under an AC vent and I was freezing the entire time and the tea really warmed me up. \nLet BF do all the ordering because the menu overwhelmed me a bit. We ended up getting the lemon chicken (which arrived a la carte, no rice), one of the chow mein dishes (sadly can't remember which- I think seafood), and the bbq pork egg foo young.\nAll the dishes were awesome. Can't pick a favorite because they were all good in different ways that somehow complemented one another.\n\nThe lemon chicken came out first, an a la carte portion that didn't seem as large as the price may have indicated but then again I'm used to lunch prices. The sauce was bad ass though- lemony and lightly sweet, almost like honey. I've never tasted a sauce this good. Felt that the chickne was a little too crispy/crunchy though, and could have been more moist. But like I said, the sauce? Phenom.\nChow Mein was a huge portion, lots of green onion with scallops, squid, and shrimp throughout. Noodles thick and ropy, and chewy- very fresh and delicious. Sauce was subtle and really made the dish. Would order again. In fact, this dish makes me more inclined to order chow mein elsewhere in the future, now that I've tasted a really good version of it.\nLastly, the egg foo young. When we were last in Houston, I had an awesome egg foo young. That one almost doesn't even compare to this one. It was huge, for starters, and somehow really delicate. The egg and the pork really complemented one another, both savory but the egg plainer to let the pork itself shine. The sauce and green onions really brought the egg and pork together, too. Highly recommend this dish, would order again.\n\nService was fine. Nothing to write home about, nothing to complain about. Multiple servers checked on us, which was really nice and surprising. \n\nSide note: if you go to dine in, check in with your Yelp app for a free egg roll! Didn't think to check in until we were leaving and they were already technically closed, so I saved mine to redeem another time.", "author": "Stefany V."}

You can also eat all kinds of Dim Sum here. They offer Dim Sum all day, but the Dim Sum cart are only offered from 8am to 3pm. If you order Dim Sum during the Dim Sum cart time, the prices of all kinds of Dim Sum are cheaper. Beyond the Dim Sum cart time, the Dim Sum are a little bit expensive. I like the Dim Sum here so much, especially the shrimp noodle rolls and the cold chicken feet. I have eaten different kinds of shrimp noodle rolls and chicken feet in other restaurants and I think here is my favorite.\n\n It was my third time eating here. I ordered the steamed shrimp dumplings, the shrimp noodle rolls and the cold chicken feet. The steamed shrimp dumplings and the shrimp noodle rolls were piping hot. The shrimp noodle rolls were the best I've had and each piece had a large, tender shrimp blanketed with a silky soft layer of rice noodles. The taste was excellent and the cold chicken feet made me have a good appetite. \n\nThe other important point for me to come back again is their service. Their service is fast and enthusiastic. The servers were extremely nice and friendly. I also got two-hour parking validated sticker which is super awesome and surprising because parking in Chinatown is a big hassle.", "author": "Cimin C."}

Originally, I was gonna go to Delicious Dim Sum with someone staying at the hostel I was in, but for some reason it was closed.  At 7 pm.  Weird\n\nWe sat down after a 5 minute wait, and we ordered 4 dishes (5 counting my cup of Hot & Sour Soup). Specifically, they were the Peking Duck, Sweet & Sour Chicken, Prawns on Tender Greens (Bok Choy), and Pork with Garlic.\n\nFirst the not-so-good news.  These servings are big; don't go in there unless you have a serious appetite.The Pork with Garlic was very bland.  I was expecting a sharp little kick of garlic-y goodness, and it wasn't there.  We waited around half an hour for them to give us the bill, to the point where we had to ask them to give us our bill.  A little strange service, but otherwise fine.\n\nNow the good news.  I've never really tasted Hot & Sour soup quite like this: VERY hot, nice touches of sour flavor, and a thick broth.  The Sweet & Sour Chicken was slightly better than average, nothing to praise. The prawns were nice, and the bok choy was steamed perfectly.  However, the star of the show was the Peking Duck.  Very juicy, lightly fried, and it came with these sticky buns which the duck paired perfectly with.\n\nOverall, it was a nicely-priced restaurant which, while having a little strange service, made up for it by its generous portions and excellent cooking.

It also needed a bit more salt.  The best Young Chow I've ever had can be found at Wo-Hop (NYC).  At Wo-Hop, the fried rice comes with bits of fried egg.

After we had ordered only 9 dim sum dishes, we sat there for a good 20-30 minutes waiting to see if they would bring out anything else. THEY DIDNT.

A clean restaurant with tidy and prompt service? Look no further. I've been here a number of times and I can easily say that I am a big fan. \n\nFirst off, I would like to admit that I know the owner/manager's daughter fairly well and that is how I first heard about this place. However, I'd like to point out that it in no-way, shape or form affected my judgement upon writing this review. This place has great food, an awesome atmosphere, and a hardworking staff of individuals who want to make sure you are served in a timely and proper manner.\n\nBreakfast happy hour, I like to call it, also known as dim sum time is absolutely busy at this place. Old Chinese men sharing stories of the pre-communist old country, populated families with young kids being chased around by their persevering parents, and non-regulars, like you and me, who are just looking to try out something new after trekking down and up hill all day around Chinatown just about sums up the daily demographic profile of patrons. The one thing we have in common? We'd all have love good Chinese food if we ended up here. The Dim Sum menu is fantastic and very fairly priced. I'm a fan of their shrimp dumplings and braised eggplant. I find that a lot of Chinese restaurants tend to overcook and over-season their eggplant to make up for the fact that it may be aged a little too wisely and Peninsula Seafood cooks it just right - fresh, not soggy, and with just the perfect amount of seasoning.\n\nThis review would not be complete without throwing in a shout-out to their honey walnut shrimp, which may just about worth visiting just to try. I live 40 minutes away in Sunnyvale, and I would take a drive right now just to grab myself some. \n\nAll in all, this is a first-class restaurant that cooks great food and doesn't cut any corners when it comes to their food prep and service. I've eaten at a lot of good Chinese restaurants and was raised associating a stigma against Chinatown restaurants for having greasy and sodium enriched food paired with deliberately sluggish service. Peninsula Seafood Restaurant consistently proves me wrong and I'm always a happy customer.\n\nOn a somewhat unrelated note, if my review somehow influenced you to pay this deserving restaurant a visit, be sure to keep an eye out for a pretty girl in her early 20's named Courtni who works there and tell her Nick sent you ;)", "author": "Nick N."}

Lots of places don't provide tea anymore.\n\nThe service was better than other dim sum places we've been to, we were seated quickly even though arrived around noon on Saturday.  We never waited long to see food being walked by, but they were not pushy about it like some other places.  The place also was nicer & cleaner than some we've been to.\n\nWe liked having the option to order from the dim sum menu in addition to picking from the trays, and although there was somewhat of a language barrier we were able to talk to some of the folks, and when we asked if there were other duck dishes available than on the menu they told us the options.  This is way better than other places where you just get funny looks if you try talking with them!   \n\nThey also honored the sign in the window and credited us for 2 hours of parking in the nearby deck, and quickly took care of our check when we were ready.  \n\nWe'll definitely go back.", "author": "D R."}

The birthday boy is a dim sum snob, but was pleasantly surprised by this place. The food was good, not amazing, but good. The service was wonderful and the english-speaking female manager made all of our birthday wishes come true. It's only a $10 corkage fee, they kept our ice cream cake cool in their freezer, and even came and sang happy birthday at the end.

THEY WILL YELL AT YOU IF YOU HAVE A STROLLER!\n\nSo last week I went to Chinatown with my parents. My mom always like going there to get fresh grocery so I took my 10 months old son and went there. \n\nWe stopped by this stupid place and decided to have dim sum before shopping. AND IT WAS A MISTAKE! we didn't might a 40 min wait, that's what it is. The hostess told us she will give us a midium size round table so we have room for our baby and the stroller. Guess what? When she called us in, it was a retangular table for 4 by the walk way, then the waitress (I guess she's the manager or owner), started screaming to me: how can you bring a stroller here! There's no room for it! And I was so shocked!!! Then I asked can I keep it next to the table? She kept screaming: Don't you ever think of other people? They won't be able to walk by!!! And I was like WTF!!! People sitting around was staring at us...And it was so uncomfortable!!! Then the bixch offered us the \"midium size table\" (that was what the hostess offered at the very beginning!), and we sat it. I didn't want to argue with her while my baby and my parents were there.\n\nI was SOOOOOOOOOOOOO mad! How can these axxholes stay in business? I was gonna complaint that bixch and I looked at their counter, now I get it, she has so many picture hanging on the wall, she must be a manager or owner.\n\nWe ate, and we left. And I know I won't ever go back to this stupid place in rest of my life.\n\nThere's no manner, no managerment in this place. While I was waiting,I heard the hostess talking to waiters inside via walkie talkie: ok 2 are coming, one man one woman.....and there's another 2, guai lou..... They have no respect to their customers.\n\nThe one next door is always so much busier than this place, I guess that's the reason. \n\nOh I almost forgot, this place is definitely BAD for infants, there's no place to change a diaper for my baby and I had to go to the bathroom with my mom, I held the baby and mom took care of the rest. No changing table! And the bathroom is sooo gross! \n\nOk, I feel better now.", "author": "T J."}

Also, kind of screwing yourselves because what if I wanted to add a higher tip? hmmm. Also, the place was kind of a mess, there was stuff and crumbs all over the floor that they were sweeping up.

Their menu consists of all the cliche Chinese dishes and dishes that seem like they made it up on the top of their heads. Their pricing is outrageous for the small amount of food for each dish. And guess what? The table next to us got the same dish as us and they got 2x as much. Apparently, the owners know them and got better treatment than the rest of the people in the restaurant. Is this restaurant a business or a home kitchen where you whip out more extravagant dishes for your friends and relatives?? The table behind us ordered when we were halfway done eating. When we were done eating, they STILL didn't get their food yet. I overheard them ordering a set meal, and usually Chinese people order different dishes so I guessed they take longer to make the set meals. They were tourists from a foreign country, I can't be sure if that has to do with anything... But really, they didn't get their food even after 30 minutes...

It was crispy on the outside and really light/fluffy on the inside.  The sauce wasn't the best ever but it was still good.  The spare ribs were a lot of bone and little meat, but still good.  The noodles did not have any bok choy, which was a let down and it caused the noodles to be a bit on the bland side.  \n\nAs previous reviews alluded to, the wait staff is about what you should expect from Chi-town...not the most attentive in the world, but they bring you your food quickly and are good enough to tip 20%.\n\nHuge portion sizes, cheap prices, good food.
