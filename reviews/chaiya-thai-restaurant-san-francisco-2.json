Dining at the restaurant for the first time, I'm glad to note the quality of the dishes was spot on.  Having been to Thailand and many other Thai restaurants in the Bay Area, flavor wise I would say the dishes were a tad lacking in that Thai \"kick\" I've grown to love - the perfect combination of texture and spice. The fried fish dish we had was flavorful and very eye appealing, however, for the price point, perhaps the fish portion size could have been a tad more.  If you are used to traditional, bold Thai flavors, ask for a side of prik nam pla like we did and spice up your dishes.  Overall, not a bad experience at all.  Service was very friendly.", "author": "Roger E."}

It was clean, modern, and with good simple decor. The food, however, was mediocre. We ordered this dish that had five spoons with a big prawn and quail egg in each, accompanied by two dipping sauces. The prawns were fresh and had a good \"crunch\" to them, but I don't think that they justified the $15 price point. My fiance ordered a beef noodle soup and was disappointed that the noodles were more similar to pho noodles than the flat rice noodles that usually come with it. He also felt like the noodles were a little overcooked and therefore too soft. I ordered the eggplant salad and felt that it wasn't really a salad. In fact, looking at the \"salads\" section of the menu, most of the items listed there don't really qualify to be under that category. Red onions, green onions, cilantro, and mint do not a salad make. But I've been trying to eat healthier and chose to order it anyway. It was mediocre and came in an overall small portion size given that the ingredients to make it are very inexpensive.\n\nThe waitresses at this restaurant were excellent - they were friendly and quick to fill up our water cups. However, the food wasn't good enough for me to be returning.", "author": "Nicole M."}

They ordered in from here for dinner. \n\nThey ordered a few different things for us to share. Starter was the fried calamari with chili jam. The pieces were very big from the batter which made it hard to share, but the crispy basil on top was super good. \n\nFor mains, we shared Thai fried rice with chicken, red curry with shrimp, pad Thai, and a pumpkin stir fry with ground chicken and veggies. The coconut curry was good and had some heat to it, which I always like, but there were only a few shrimp in it. The pumpkin stir fry was good. I loved the flavor and texture of the pumpkin in the dish, but the rest of the dish was missing some depth of flavor. \n\nThe Thai fried rice was not as spicy as I prefer and needed to be paired with some of the other dishes to give it some more flavor. Pad Thai was ok, but the noodle were very soft. \n\nTo finish, we had the mango sticky rice which was pretty good. Overall everything was fine but wouldn't go out of my way to go back.", "author": "Ashtar B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-07", "description": "Chaiya has really great food but the portions are a little smaller than you'd want for the prices.  The one gripe I've found with the Pad See Ew is that there are not enough noodles or broccoli in it.  Strangely enough, it's mostly meat.  It's not as satisfying when you eat it because you don't get as much of those smooth sticky yummy noodles as you want.  \n\nI also do not like that they use regular broccoli instead of Chinese broccoli (the last time I ordered, I got 4 small florets in the whole dish).  The flavors are on point but the dish just really needs more noodles, which would bulk up the portion to what it should be and also make to ratios better too.  \n\nThe lemon chicken is out of the world and the yellow curry is one of the best I've ever had (nice thick-but-not-too-thick consistency and it's also not too sweet the way so many yellow curries are).  \nIf Chaiya slightly lowered their prices or increased their portions, I would order from them once a week.  As it is, I only order it as a treat yo self.", "author": "Emma H."}

We were greeted warmly, escorted to a table, and handed some thick and hefty menus. But from where I was sitting, something caught my eye on the opposite wall:\n\nApp Combo - combination crisp appetizers. Ooh, let's start with that. Then it was back to the menu. We ordered Pad Thai and Seafood Paradise, with jasmine rice on the side.\n\nThe App Combo was excellent, since everything was fried. Tofu triangles, spring rolls, boneless chicken, imitation crab meat and cream cheese wontons, and finally a super thin egg roll. Each item was crispy and light. I just wish they told us which item was which so we could order it on our next visit.\n\nThe Pad Thai was also excellent. Yes, every Thai restaurant serves this dish, so it's a good yardstick to compare. The plate was big enough so that I could mix the ingredients together without making a huge mess. The Pad Thai was very fresh and tasty. I really liked it. \n\nBut the unquestionable highlight of our meal was the Seafood Paradise: mussels, shrimp, calamari, and red snapper, in a light yellow curry sauce with pumpkin cubes. It was outstanding! I love mussels, there were two in the bowl. The calamari strips were tender, and the red snapper melted in our mouths. Everything was cooked perfectly.\n\nAlthough there weren't many other diners in the restaurant with us, they had plenty of take-out customers.

Though the ratio of seafood to noodles was good, some of the seafood in my dish (like the fish and the mussels) didn't taste quite right, and I left the place with a slight stomach ache.

The tom yum soup was very good.  But the main course, Sweet Pumpkin Basil, was an epic fail.

Shocked, but also intrigued.  Because as much as I might worry why no one has tried this place, there's always that possibility it's an undiscovered gem!  Although, in this case...\n\nSomewhat hidden from the rest of West Portal (it's on Claremont, around the corner from the station), Chaiya is a quaint spot that's easy to overlook.  The restaurant itself is decently nice and clean, with a wealth of tables for groups large or small.  Like the decor, the menu is pretty modern as well, though compared to some of the city's newer spots, it's more basic than extensive/unique.\n\n-- CORN FRITTER - Battered Fried Corn with Thai Herbs, Spices, Chopped Kaffir Lime Leaves, and a Sweet Chili Sauce...$6\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chaiya-thai-restaurant-san-francisco-2#mHu4pCXLx308b2MD3okQGQ)\nNot bad, but the texture/consistency was a little off.  I liked how the corn wasn't overly sweet and how crispy it was, but the core was a bit gummy.  The ones I recently had at Tycoon Thai in the TL were better, though.\n\n-- CHAIYA SPECIAL NOODLES - Seafood Combination saut\u00e9ed with Flat Rice Noodles in Chili Paste...$15\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chaiya-thai-restaurant-san-francisco-2#_rEEQ1OajhDcAiEaRISy2A)\nI feared the usual \"seafood combination\" (chewy squid, tasteless shrimp, etc.), so the fish and mussels were welcome surprises.  The noodles had the right bite and the chili paste added just enough heat to balance the sauce's sweetness.  The overall taste didn't amaze, but it was pretty solid.\n\n-- LAVA CHICKEN - Marinated Grilled Deep Fried Thighs Topped with Bell Pepper, Onions, Cilantro, and Signature Plum Sauce...$14\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chaiya-thai-restaurant-san-francisco-2#-yhabMownv7E_UoxOH-yGg)\nThose four big pieces got us excited, but this was a huge miss.  The sauce was spicy (albeit sweet), but the chicken was TORCHED.  Impressive, since I've never had dark meat so overcooked and dry before.  I thought it was a typo, but maybe it really was cooked twice (\"grilled deep fried\").\n\nSince coming here, I had been debating whether to round up or down from TWO AND A HALF STARS, but I ultimately decided to round up.  As bad as the chicken was, it was just one dish.  Plus, given their location and wealth of parking, they're very convenient for dining in or doing take out (they also deliver).  I just don't know if I'll be back.  If/when I do, I'll probably avoid their chicken dishes...", "author": "Mike L."}

However, they offer decent Thai food in a low-key environment.\n\nWe started off with the Tom Yum soup, which was very warming on a cool, rainy day. It was nicely balanced with both sweet and sour flavors, both complimenting each other well. Mushrooms and protein (in our case, chicken) were plentiful.\n\nOne of our main entrees, the pineapple fried rice (which they call Hawaiian fried rice), was rather salty, despite the fact that they claim to not use MSG. The chicken was very dry and chewy too. I also felt like the kitchen threw this dish together too sloppily, as we had a few clusters of white rice and raisins stuck together, not distributed evenly throughout the whole dish. Our second entree, the grilled salmon in banana leaf, was also a little dry and unfortunately bland. The banana leaf was huge, given the impression the salmon filet would be a generous portion; however, upon unwrapping the leaf, the filet was actually small.\n\nWe finished off with the sweet sticky rice with mango dessert. The portion was huge and very rich and filling. After the Tom Yum, the dessert was probably the next best dish of the night.\n\nChaiya is quite spacious, modern, clean, and welcoming, and they're perfect for large groups.

I was surprised by how tasteless the Pad Thai was. It had all the right ingredients: noodles, ground up peanuts, green onion, eggs, tofu, bean spouts. But the flavor was altogether bland and boring. A squirt of the provided lemon slice helped slightly.\n\nI was also disappointed with the size of the meal. I was left unsatisfied by the flavor as well as the portion. I ended up grabbing a snack from my pantry afterwards to fill my stomach.\n\nI don't know what the rest of the menu is like but I would not recommend their Pad Thai unless they kick up their recipe a few notches.", "author": "Samuel J."}

(I hate boys)\n\nParking was easy at this hour since everything in the West Portal district closes by 9ish.

These are more like fried squid-looking pieces, but the sauce it comes with is AMAZING. Some type of aoili-tartar hybrid of deliciousness. Mmhmmmmmm.\n\nAfter sending the waitress back 10 times because we weren't ready, the boys and I finally decided on:\n\nTom Yum Soup w/ Tofu: Deeeeeliciously flavored broth, BUT they seemed to have just threw a bunch of leftover veggies in there right before serving it to us because the carrots, WHITE mushrooms(wtf?) and whatever else crap in there was not soft or cooked or tender or like anything I wanted in my mouth.. (heh) but the broth itself was freakn good.\n\nVolcano Duck: WARNING: THIS SHIT AIN'T CURRY-- my illiterate friend thought we were getting curry, but this dish is tender duck meat w/ a blast of spice. More bones and other ass veggies than duck meat, but that's what you get when you order duck. Let's be real. We all know and expect that.\n\nSpecial Seafood House Noodles: Flat thick chow fun-like noodles w/ big pieces of fresh seafood- clams, shrimp, scallops, + squid. Whatever their house sauce is= YUM! I'd recommend this shiet.\n\nMango Trout: This is a whole fried trout with a side of mango salsa. Each of us tasted the trout on its own and unanimously thought out loud that it was kind of dry. Then we realized we were supposed to eat it WITH the mango salsa and BOOM (*mindblown*)! The mangos were SO sweet and ripe-- it complemented the trout SO well. Frickn good. Yes.\n\nService was good. Our food didn't take too long, the waitress was attentive and refilled our waters in a timely manner. No complaints hurrrrrr!\n\nThe place is nice, clean, modern, and well-decorated.

We've tried Chaiya a few times and the delivery is totally unpredictable - sometimes they're early (yay!) and sometimes they are really late. Our experience tonight will be our last one with them because our food never arrived at all.\n\nWe placed an order on GrubHub at 7:30 p.m. and it was scheduled to arrive at 8:30 p.m. When 8:45 p.m. rolled around, I called to see when we could expect it. The person that answered the phone said it was on it's way and would be there in 10-15 minutes. I expressed my disappointment in having to wait an hour and a half for thai food from a restaurant that's not too far from my house (yes, I realize now I should have just picked it up, but this place also doesn't have parking), but we continued to wait.\n\n15 minutes later at 9 p.m. the food still hadn't arrived, so I called to check in again. At this point they said the order had actually never been made, but they would be happy to start making it now. This means that when I called before to check on it they lied and instead of looking into the status of my order, just said what they needed to in order to get me off the phone.\n\nSince it was now 9 p.m. and who knows how long it would take for them to make and deliver the order given their current pace, I just asked them to cancel it and refund my money.\n\nMaybe this place is ok if you're not in any hurry to eat or want to dine in, but if you have any plans to eat in the next couple hours, you might want to try somewhere else.", "author": "Nicole O."}

It was the end of our bachelorette weekend and we ended up around West Portal to find a place to eat.  While deciding, I decided to get gas while everyone decides what to eat.  I searched thai restaurant and Yelp and this place was the first to come up.  We didn't realize we were on Claremont and the restaurant was just few steps away from us, score!  \nWe were a bit hesitant to go here because it had few reviews, but we figured it looked nice enough so it's worth a try.  Parking wasn't really an issue around the residential area.  We walked in and it had a nice clean ambiance.  I like the simple touches they had.  \n\nWe ordered a lot of food.  I guess we didn't realize we were that hungry.  Some of the food we ordered were golden basket, chicken satay, chicken pad basil, yellow chicken curry, pad thai, pad c u, eggplant dish, short ribs, lava chicken, and grilled chicken.  Before you think we're bunch of heffas, there were 6 of us.  Ok that was still a lot of food.  Well we did have leftover, well some of us did.  My favorites were the pad thai and chicken pad basil.  My friends liked the curry but I thought it was a bit too sweet for me.  Least favorite was the short ribs, didn't really have much flavor. \n\nYou would think we should be stuffed but we had to end the dinner with dessert.  We all shared, or should I say devoured their pandan cake in less than 5 minutes.  The cake was moist and the sauce was good.  The coconut sorbet was a little bit icy (seems homemade) and I would see why they would use sorbet rather than ice cream... it's a good balance of texture.  \n\nService was good.

First of all, stubhub is amazing - so easy - and I'm so happy that this Thai restaurant was one of my nearby delivery choices! \n\nThe delivery at first said approximately one hour to an hour and a half. Makes sense when you're ordering around 6pm on a Friday eve. Three minutes later, my phone updates me that the order will drive within 45-55 minutes. I thought my app/phone was going crazy, but my doorbell literally rang within that time. The delivery man was extremely nice and made sure to thank me many times and told me to enjoy my food! Usually, delivery people say hi, take their tip and bounce.\n\nThe food was great! Very fresh and still extremely warm. We ordered:\n\n-Tom yum soup (large) with shrimp. Delicious! Just the right spice and flavor. \n-steamed veggies and shrimp topped with peanut sauce. Amazing and healthy! \n-glass noodles with veggies, shrimp and egg. Also, very good. Full of flavor. \n\nI will definitely order from here again! Also, will probably dine here soon (when I'm not sick)!", "author": "Anastasia N."}

I LOVE Thai food and have eaten at many Thai restaurants in many cities, including SF. This was by far the worst Thai food I have ever had in my life. The sweet, savory flavor that you expect from Thai, were non-existent. We ordered 3 dishes and an appetizer for take out, all of which had a similar lack of flavor accompanied by a vague taste of rancidity. It was like our whole order was cooked in bad oil or something.  We paid way too much for small portions which really left a bad taste in my mouth. To top it all off, our daughter got sick that night from the noodles and tofu and we were up all night with a barfing kid.", "author": "Sarah A."}

And tried all my favorites.  Take it from me, if you are in the area, come here and tell them Best sent you.  \n\nFood (3/3):  I have tried a lot here.  I have to say they make it just right too, at least what I like. \nSom-tum or papaya salad is what I really like.  They make it just right.  Flavors are all there.  Sweet, sour, spicy: the flavors of Thailand.  \nGrilled pork is really tender.  It too is full of flavors.  I really like how when you bite into it, it has juices and isn't dry.  \nPork jerky is different from other places. They fry it and don't fry it very dry.  I don't really think it's a jerky, but more of a fried pork, which is perfectly fine with me, because it is really good!  Juicy and savory!\nOf course they have the pad Thai and pad c  u.  Those are also really good if you feel like getting the regular typical Thai foods.  I'm not a big curry fan, so I can't really advise on that.  They also make their own ice cream!  So if make sure to save some room for dessert!\n\nValue: (1/1)\nThe prices are fair and you get food that I would say is worth it.  Portions are good for the price you pay so ill give it a 1.\n\nService and atmosphere:(1/1)\nUsually, the main waitess is Cindy, but she also goes by Ring.  She is always making sure if everything is okay and friendly.  The place has more of a modern feel to it than regular traditional Thai restaurants and is a place that I would say you could take someone out on a date to.  \n\nOverall, I'd say this is a great place to go to get Thai food!

Chicken pieces were sort of dry, the noodles are thin and was over cooked.  Bean spouts and chopped peanuts were served on the side.  Didn't look like there was that much tofu.  As another reviewer indicated, \"I've had better\". \n2. Tom Yum soup for one, $4. Just as spicy and tart as the 1st time.  I like the flavor and there were 2-3 prawns in the soup, lots of mushrooms, tomatoes.  \n3. Chicken Laab, $12.  Used to be a Thai place on Balboa St in the Outer Richmond that made the best Laab in my opinion.  This one was spicy but just didn't have the flavor compared to the old place.  Other places serve it with regular iceberg lettuce, this place has a small pile of spring salad, didn't quite fit with traditional Thai laab.\nI wouldn't order this one again.\n4.  Dessert - now, the Pandan Cake, $7 is worth every calorie and every bite. A wedge of a green colored cake, topped with a green cornstarchy like sauce with oodles of coconut flakes in it and served with a large scoop of ice-milk coconut sorbet topped with a sprinkle of granola.  I would skip the laab and had the soup with the dessert.  \n\nAs I stated before, some dishes are hit or miss.  The waiter couldn't tell me what type of sweetener was used in the Thai iced tea, $3.  It was sort of weak and he gave it to me and forgot the Half and Half and had to go back to put it in.  The waitress told me it was sugar they used, so I skipped the sweetener as I thought it would be condensed milk.  The wait staff still struggles with English comprehension. She couldn't explain to me was ingredients were in the Pandan cake and stated, \"I don't know the word\".  Food service was slow considering there were only 4 of us in the whole place.  \nOur order was placed first but the other 2 diners got their food first and Hubby was getting annoyed about the wait and we had to ask a couple of times about the food and they said \"It's coming\".  \n\nFor a second visit, I'd recommend the green curry, Pandan cake dessert and Tom Yum soup only if you can handle the spicy and tartness.", "author": "Ry T."}

The taste was bland, mushrooms tasteless and lacking any  of the flavors from lemongrass, galangal and Kaffir leaves. Usually you see those things. Not a speck that I could see or taste.

Next came the Beef Waterfall Salad, all I can say is it was the greatest salad any true carnivore could ask for! The description is : Charcoal prime ribs seasoned with herbs, mint leaves red onions, scallions and dried chili pepper tossed in lime juice....if this sounds amazing to you, IT IS!!!

The portions were fantastic on everything! I washed it all down with some yummy thai iced tea and a thai beer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "This is one of the hidden gems that everyone loves to discover.  As devout Thai eaters, we've dined all over the city for years searching for the best Thai restaurants.  There are some good ones in SF, and everyone has their favorite.  However, Chaiya Thai completely surprised us.  They are located in an out of the way location in West Portal, making walk-ins rare.  So it doesn't seem like much from the outside.  But the food is some of the best we have had in the city.  And we are picky.  This is a must try place for foodies into Thai, and for folks anywhere within a few miles of West Portal.  Our favorites are the curries (green, especially) and the appetizers.  You will be happy you tried it.", "author": "John W."}

Some vegetables in the soup were colder then others. The breaded fish was soggy. The fresh roll was 95% lettuce and that's all. The dipping sauce was OK, not stellar. The beef was not very flavorful, but at least it wasn't ground beef, which some other Thai restaurants sell.  Overall disappointing.", "author": "Don m."}

Tucked away behind the busy West Portal shopping area, it delivered more than its modest appearance promised.  Simple, sparse decor, but comfortable seating with pillows to adjust for settling in for a lovely, relaxing  meal.  The Tom Yum soup had the right amount of spice and generous sized and abundant chunks of vegetables and tofu.  The pumpkin curry dish we ordered was also filled to the brim with tender pieces of the vegetable, and the meat which we intentionally omitted was not missed; the sauce was exquisitely creamy  over brown rice..  Crispy prawns were a tasty and satisfying appetizer for three of our group of four.  One of my friends, who is struggling with a dietary problem,  was able to enjoy a dish made exactly as she had requested.  Accommodating staff, delicious food and a great value for the cost, Nary a complaint, Chaiya will be recommended highly to my friends who enjoy homey Thai food..  . \n\nL.

I usually get the yellow curry dishes which are better than most I have had.  The staff are super friendly and the prices are right.  Newly refurbished in a space where a lot of restaurants have been over the past 10 years.  You should give it a try.", "author": "David B."}

I was afraid it was one of those places with a nice ambience but horrible food, but I was pleasantly surprised.  The dishes tasted authentic and delicious.   It's one of the better Thai places I've had around here and will definitely be choosing it over some of the other restaurants closer to my house.  Overall, it's good food, affordable prices, and nice ambience.  Great value.", "author": "B J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-08", "description": "Ordered take out here last night.  When we arrived home the order was wrong so we contacted them and they didn't even apologies.  We had to return in order to collect the correct dish.  Despite the error being their fault I had to sit and wait 20 minutes for the original dish I had ordered.  They then took back the dish they had originally given to us.  I had expected that they'd insist we keep it as a gesture for the inconvenience of having to drive back to the restaurant but nope, no doubt it was reheated and given to another customer.  The girl didn't even offer an apology for the error or for leaving me sitting another 20 minutes.  The place itself is very basic, clean enough but the service is so slow.  Only one person to take phone orders, serve seated customers and serve take out clients.   While I waited for my take out I thought the service was all over the place.  People at the same tables receiving their meals at different times and there were only four tables of people in total.  The place is just under staffed and as a result the customer service is very poor.   That said, the dish that we ordered  (green curry) was really good but miserable amount of chicken.  I would recommend take out for sure but if your in a hurry forget it!", "author": "Jackie L."}
