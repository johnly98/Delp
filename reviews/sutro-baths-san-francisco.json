You can explore the baths from above, below, and inside the cave (there's even a hope in the middle directly into the ocean). The stairs down are uneven and there's not a proper handle, so it can be tricky for those with mobility issues, since there's no ramps. The visitor center and Cliff House have info about the history, old photos, and artifacts from the height of the baths - definitely worth a look to see the former grandeur! \n\nSide note: Don't be dumb. People have died by going over barricades, trying to climb on rocks/ledges, or attempting swimming. The waves can be unpredictable and strong. If you fall or are swept away, you will get caught in the undertow or thrashed on the rocks. Just stay on the paths. It's not worth it.", "author": "Bren C."}

A visitor center sits at the top of the hill with amenities. Those with walking disabilities won't be able to descend into the ruins area. The largest remaining structure of the Ruins is covered with some pretty cool graffiti, but most of the ruins just look like short, stone walls peeking out of the water. It was pretty fun to walk atop those stone walls. Even if your balance is terrible, it's not difficult to do, but if you fall, it'll be a 6-foot tumble. The entire structure lasted until fairly recent in history (early 1900s)- the visitor center was closed when we visited, so we had to research on our own how the Ruins looks like prior, as well as its history.\n\nWALKING THE SURROUNDING TRAILS\nNext to the Ruins is a very, short trail leading through a cave and into a decent view of the cliffs and large rocks in the rear.

But after living in the Bay Area for quite sometime, I've learned that the City has a ton of gems that are just waiting to be explored. The Sutro Baths and its' ruins are just one of the many San Francisco landmarks that people from all over the world come here to see.\n \nIt tells a story of a painful past. A struggling indoor pool infrastructure that proved to be too costly to operate. Memories of a building being engulfed in flames due to arson. And now, the ruins left behind from the whole catastrophe. All that's left behind are remnants of what used to be. Pieces of an unfinished building. Parts of the large swimming pools. It's so crazy how something that would normally be defined as an eyesore has turned out to be so incredibly beautiful. \n\nWhen I come here and I see these ruins... my heart bleeds. There's such a strong sense of history and sadness that you just can't help but to feel a certain way. And then, there are the caves down below. It feels like you're going back in time while you're walking through those caves. If you walk up the stairs towards the Coastal Trail, it will take you to a great viewpoint. The views here are just immaculate! Sweeping views of the ocean waves and the dilapidated ruins down below. It will make you feel like you're on top of the world. \n\nNothing beats seeing this incredible part of US history. Pair it with the magnificent views of the California coastline and the sounds of the calming water waves, and you'll end up with some of the most precious and vivid memories in your lifetime.", "author": "Shayla B."}

The hip is the most erotic and neglected body part. Kiss the hip bone with your lips... & I'm yours\" - Karen McDougal (Playboy) \n\nOk, I'm a time traveler and I'll cut to the chase and say the glorious Victorian era was a time of excess, and well excess. The upper class women, often wore a tightly laced corset over a bodice or chemisette, and paired them with a skirt adorned with numerous embroideries & trims; over layers of petticoats. Yes, excess. For the gentleman, it was all about the Norfolk jacket and tweed or woolen breeches were used for rugged outdoor sports, like croquet & shooting. Knee-length topcoats, often with contrasting velvet or fur collars, and calf-length overcoats were worn later in the year. Men's leather shoes had higher heels and a narrow toe. And yes, the male corset was as popular as a waxed mustache on a humid day. Ahh the 1890's...\n\nSo what does time traveling have to do with the Sutro Baths? I'll be your voyeur to the Victorian era when the Sutro Baths were brand spanking new. It was mainly for the upper classes as mentioned above, and as we all know by now... the wealthiest are the naughtiest class out there. Or, do you prefer the word \"kinky\". Whatever your preference the overdressed, excessive, too snooty crowd needed to let loose somewhere and the Sutro Baths was the place to be. C'mon unlace that leather corset, toss those knickers in the air, and let it all hangout!\n\nBack in the day, the Sutro Baths consisted of... \nSix saltwater pools and one freshwater pool. \nThe pools included seven slides, thirty swinging rings, and one springboard. The saltwater was cycled naturally from the Pacific Ocean. Private dressing rooms were available for the more prudish ladies & gents. A museum and ice rink was also part of the Sutro building. However, due to its high maintenance and overestimating the wealthy population it suffered financially for many years until finally closing many decades later. A planned demolishing never took place because the entire building was burned down. Sadly, it was arson that took the walls off of the old Sutro Baths. R.I.P.\n\nToday, the only thing left is the foundation of a once majestic Victorian building. The ruins is a daily reminder of once excessive era. It's a popular landmark via a short hike from either the historic Cliff House or from Ocean Beach. It is no longer private and part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and the Sutro Historic District. All in all, I'd recommend the Sutro Baths to history lovers and the casual hikers. The best part is that it's absolutely free today, so bring the kids, but note it's true ruins, so don't expect glitz or glamour. Just bring your appreciation of yesteryear and a naughty imagination. Another bonus is if you get bored the Lands End and Coastal hikes are nearby too.

Anywho, the view, the adventure, the everything -- is why I've always wanted to see what the SB's were all about.\n\nEven though we came on a dreary, slightly drizzling February day -- we still made the best of it. As you pass the Clif house, its glitz and glam, then right by the Look out, you can turn in and park. I didn't realize the Lands' End trail was also nestled right near the SB's too. So it makes it a very convenient sight seeing location and also a place to get active -- walking or running!\n\nYou make your way down 135 steps (yes, I counted), then down a slightly steep decline down to the actual baths. There is nothing about this area or things that suggest you should walk on them or explore, BUT everyone does! It's totally fine, just don't think about what would happen if you fell.\n\nI'm sure on a really nice day the view is even better. But I still reveled in the dreary day. The ocean splashing against the rocks, the light rain hitting the water in the baths, and the overall serenity of the area.\n\nThere is a small little cave, but at the end of it, it was blocked off -- no clue why, assuming for the safety of everyone. And to note that there was no where to go, other than climb on rocks.\n\nI think this is a great place to go adventuring. It's free, its fun, and there is even some history posted so you can learn about the geographical history of this area. \n\nThere is a sign saying that cars get broken into all the time, so be smart!\n\nPerfect adventuring for a local or an out-of-towner!", "author": "Steph G."}

Instead of being located on some desolate road in the middle of nowhere, the Sutro Baths is located right on the coast in San Francisco, so you can enjoy the beach as well as explore some ruins. \n\nTo get to the actual ruins you have to climb down a massive set of wooden stairs, perfect for those looking to get some cardio on your visit. Even if you don't make it down to the ruins themselves, there is a splendid view of them from the top of the staircase. \n\nBefore heading all the way down into the ruins I would recommend checking out the upper level first. You get an amazing view of the ocean, a snippet of the Golden Gate Bridge, and another perspective on the ruins below. From this little balcony on the side you can also see the ocean in all its glory, and watch as wave after wave crashes into rocks below. \n\nBelow the balcony is a short cave. Inside the cave is another view of the crashing waves, and at the end yet another.\n\nThe ruins of the bathhouse are definitely a sight. You can just visualize what the place used to look like. Everything is all tagged up, but it doesn't take away from how remarkable the place is. I was a little surprised to find parents letting their toddlers climb across the ruins because there is water surrounding everything. \n\nThere is a parking lot for this place; however, you can also park on the street if you can find a spot. One of the best parts about this place is that there is very little to no traffic. \n\nI would recommend checking this place out if you're looking for something new to see in the city.", "author": "Jonathan R."}

I made the mistake of wearing a very thin shirt under just one hoodie. I was freezing! So wear layers! Good thing I warmed up after walking a bit though.\n\nWe parked in the parking lot next to the visitor's center and above the ruins. We came here before a rush of visitors so we found parking easily. The walk down to the ruins is quick and easy, so we checked that out as well as the tunnel out to the rocky side.\n\nWe ended up exploring the rest of the area by following the nearby trails. Mild walk, a few stairs that were harder to go up than down on (my thighs were buuurning), lots of pretty stuff to look at! We followed the trail towards the cliff area we had seen earlier from around the USS SF Memorial site. Checked out the labyrinth too before heading down towards the water.\n\nThe four of us had packed lunches so we sat down on a log to eat and watched dogs play together in the sand. There were some obvious bonfire pits (like 4 or 5) that had been occupied from the night before. Two of them were still smoking! Smoke was billowing out! We sat around one of the smoky ones and ended up pouring some water over the smoky log. Also the one we were sitting at was LITTERED with beer bottles, half-used lighters and fluid bottles, and miscellaneous trash. It was so frustrating to see. People really need to learn how to clean up after their asses and/or there should be some trash cans installed.\n\nAnyway... after that we explored some less traveled trails and saw a lot of pretty flora! Careful of thorny plants though, I was wearing some thin leggings and had to proceed with much caution.\n\nHad a great (and tiring) hike back to the car. I really enjoyed visiting the Sutro Baths and surrounding Land's End trails. :)", "author": "Shanise M."}

Imagine: Bath house ruins, filled to the brim with water reflecting the sky above. Silhouettes of visitors walking along the stone edge between the baths and the ocean... From where you're standing, it looks like they're walking on water. \n\nFind a clear day and aim to get here an hour before sunset. There's parking at the Lands End Lookout, but on a nice day it'll most likely be crowded, so you might spend some time circling for parking. If it's packed, you might have better luck up the hill by the residential areas.\n\nThere's quite an elevation difference between the parking lot and the actual baths, so as you might expect there are a LOT of stairs... which makes for a tiring walk back up. If you decide to go all the way down, don't be afraid to go into the cave (it's not that great on the other side, but it's something to do). Watch out for wet sand inside, if you're wearing sandals. If you're wearing comfy shoes, I highly advise walking along the baths to the south end of the area, under the Cliff House restaurant. At the end of the ruins, you can climb down to the beach and dig your toes into the (admittedly cold) sand and water. \n\nIf you've already been here at sunset, I'd advise coming in the afternoon and taking the Lands End trail for a great view of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge -- for my fellow lazy peers, don't worry: it's more of a walk than a hike. \n\nNote: Don't come here if it's a foggy day. You won't see much, and it won't give you any sort of wow factor. I've heard that SF gets foggier in the summer, so you might want to visit during the winter months (when it's not raining, of course). \n\nThere aren't many sights in the world that can take my breath away.

We love visiting ruins and historical buildings and clearly seeing the demolished concrete walls, the blocked off stairs and passageways of where something used to be got me curious about what and how this place looked like before. Turns out that in the late 19th century, Sutro Baths was to be the world's largest indoor public swimming pool built by and named after a former mayor of San Francisco, who was also a rich entrepreneur.  History states that \"... the baths struggled for years, mostly due to the very high operating and maintenance costs, and eventually closed.\" and just as it was to be demolished a fire destroyed the building and was abandoned. Read up more on it on your spare time as it is more interesting to know about the place before you visit.\n\nThe ruins was quite interesting to explore as we went over and around rocks and old bricks and even inside a tunnel or cave. The tunnel wasn't very long or deep, Just midway through there's a deep opening leading through the ocean and waves would crash into the cave at high tide. There is no exit at the other end of the tunnel but is said to be haunted, there is just an opening where you can view more rocks and the ocean. This tunnel lies directly to the right of the old sunken building at Sutro Baths. The cliff and surf area can be extremely dangerous and there is actually a sign posted there that people have been swept from the rocks and drowned, so use great caution and watch out for rogue waves! \n\nThere is a hiking trail to the Upper Coastal Trail which is 760 ft. Be careful because it is a steep trail with uneven terrain. Looking towards the ocean you can also see a set of rock formation island, they called this Seal Rocks, because of the history and population of sea lions. Overall, very interesting day and we never did get a chance to eat at the restaurant for some reason. Oh, and bring a jacket, can get windy. Wear layers.\n\nReview #0346", "author": "May A."}

He created a public bathhouse that housed seven pools, each with different temperatures, along with entertainment and educational areas at this coastal facility for an inexpensive time out for families.\n\nHere at Sutro Baths, you're looking at what's left of it-- Some of the concrete foundation. The bathhouse wasn't always a bathhouse as it became an ice rink afterward to try and become more profitable after popularity dwindled. That didn't really take off so the property was later slated to be demolished and build high-rise apartments and that never happened due to a fire. From then it became apart of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, landmarked for people to come see what use to be.\n\nI wonder what the ocean floor looks like after failed seawalls have crumbled into it.. It's amazing that it existed and it makes you wonder about that time.\n\nYou can take a ton of steps down to the site or view it from the street level. You can walk around the ruins and explore. I recommend wearing, at the least, sneakers if you're going down to the site. There's sand, dirt, and gravel that, personally, I wouldn't want entering my footwear..

My friends and I parked at Land Ends Lookout parking lot and made our way down to Sutro Baths. Parking can be a little difficult to find but cars are always coming and leaving so I would advise that you wait in an aisle and wait for someone to leave instead of constantly driving around.\n\nAfter we parked, we trekked down the steps to the ruins and explored the cave first. The sand inside the cave was very soft and black. I was wearing sandals so I could feel it because there was one area where my feet sunk into the soft sand. At the end of the cave, you can sort of see the sea and crashing waves. It is a bit dangerous so explore with caution.\n\nFrom the entrance of the cave, if you look out to the rock in the water, apparently the hole of that rock forms a heart. I found out about this after so I did not get a chance to see it with my own eyes but I saw a picture of it.\n\nLots of exploring around the baths and cool photo ops if you don't mind getting a little wet and dirty. I saw people making their way out to the far rock and climbing that thing.\n\nFor our way back to the car, we took the adventurous route and it was a bit steep and turned into a teamwork hike. The guys in our group had to pull up the girls because some of the steps were a bit high. That was a little unexpected workout. Definitely wear comfortable shoes around here, no high heels or heeled boots or you will be struggling.", "author": "Minh-An C."}

However, when a fire destroyed the remains in 1966, the apartment plans were abandoned and now these concrete ruins are left.

It's easier to get to Sutro Baths area if you take public transportation than I thought it would be. Just take #38 till the end, get off, you'll see the ocean, walk toward it- less than a minute (it's so close!) and you'll see the Visitor's center ahead. The Visitor's Center is great, you can find more info inside, use their restrooms, warm up at their cafe. There are signs that lead you to the baths. I wouldn't call this a hike, you can take the stairs down, or walk downhill and you'll be there in a minute. If you drive, they have a free parking lot. \n\nThis place is so beautiful, so picturesque that you have to be a moron to not take decent photos of it. Wherever you turn your camera there are wonderful vistas. The views are so dramatic and so San Francisco! It's like the background of a scene in a movie, a great movie. \n\nThe cave is nearby, small, but cool, you can hear the waves hitting its walls and see the ocean at the end of it. The ruins of the old baths are cool and full of poetry if you're into historic sights. Also, you get nice views on your left of the Cliff House restaurant. \n\nIt was sunny, but cold and windy when we visited, but we couldn't care less. We were mesmerized by this place. There are locals strolling around, tourists, but it's the type of place that's not that crowded and everyone coexists in peace and enjoys the majestic views.

It's always been on my to do list. Anyways brief history lesson from what my friend learned on his podcast--some really rich dude once wanted to build a bath house for his guests in his apartment complexes. Unfortunately, he mispredicted the rate at which SF would grow and by the time he was done with the bath house, SF hadn't sprawled into what it is today and so no one could even get to his bath house. As a result, it tarnished and is what it is today--a really fun rock climbing adventure right by the sea with some amazing views.\n\nMy friend and I came the weekend after #hellastorm and we were extremely fortunate to get some amazing weather. I love this place. I'm kind of a dork and really enjoy jumping around and climbing rocks and that's basically what the ruins are. The ruins are more or less the perimeter of the bath house area. You can walk on them and walk seaside. It's lovely. Get your iPhone/Instagram/VSCO game on because it is literally so stunning. You have the lovely Pacific Ocean juxtaposed with ancient ruins... does that not just scream all the likes on your social media posts? It's quite a number of steps down to get to the ruins (and hence obv quite a hike back up) but it's so much fun. Some people fish in the area which is interesting. Honestly I'd be pretty content to just sit here. It's not like the beach where winds can sometimes be really, really strong when you're next to the ocean. I was in a light sweater and found it to be fine. It's because there's a pretty solid buffer of rocks in between the ruins and the ocean so maybe that lowers the effect of the wind?\n\ntldr; coolest place ever, a must-go if you're only in SF for a short time. try to come during sunset, it's gorgeous", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Used to be a large, privately owned public saltwater swimming pool complex. From what I read, it burned down in 1966 hence the ruins. You get a great view of the ruins that are Left. The Trails are great, bring your dogs or go on a hike. Heard there is also a cave but didn't get to explore that, maybe next time.", "author": "Tina M."}

I've seen it on my friends' instagrams, I've seen it on a few lists, and some very creative photographers have made it look amazing ... and yet it's taken me probably 3-4 years since I found out about this place to come.\n\nIt was definitely 3-4 years too long. This place is amazing. I have to say it's better to come during sunrise or sunset because the colors of the sky and the sun really reflect well in the calm standing waters of the sutro baths, and the changing of the tides is always more interesting than during the day ... but anyway you can make it here is a good time.\n\nThere is a lot more to this place than just the ruins of the baths, but the cave was ... mediocre. It really is an amazing photography spot if you're into taking some epic views in SF. Highly, HIGHLY recommended.", "author": "Lorrie M."}

I kept canceling plans  because I worried about being cold, being too tired to hike, waking up too late, forgetting my DSLR and other things. Here's what I learned:\n\n--- There'a parking lot right by the entrance staircase. Park there, hang out at the baths for a while, and if you want more exercise follow the trails to the right for amazing views of the golden gate and Pacific Ocean. \n\n--- Wear layers, don't carry a bag. I carried a huge purse with a sweater and my DSLR, but it just got in the way of climbing the rocks around the baths. If you really want to explore the nooks and crannies of the caves and structures, you'll need as much balance and agility as possible. Next time I'll tie a sweater around my waist and carry just my camera phone in my pocket, maybeee my DSLR around my neck.\n\n--- It's not really a hike. You can walk to the baths and walk and/or jog the trails around Land's End; they aren't very strenuous and there are stairs at most of the steep parts. Easy enough for all ages. There were a number of people walking their dogs around here.\n\n--- I probably would have enjoyed going alone with a camera, but I'm glad I went with someone else.

Don't get too happy though, on weekends it's usually HARD to find a spot and I ended up stalking people as they left to grab their space! (We came around 1PM on a Sunday) There is also a Lookout Cafe inside the visitor's center which offers coffee, espressos, sandwiches, salads, and soups! (Open daily 9AM-5PM) \n\nThere is a hiking trail--so wear comfortable clothes and tennis shoes with a GRIP-- that takes you down towards the Sutro baths ruins (I even saw some people walking ON the narrow walls of these old baths!! If you're brave enough you can join them!) and also through a neat cave (VERY SANDY so again wear TENNIS SHOES!) where you can walk towards the Golden Gate Bridge! Perfect place for pictures!! The views are so breathtaking I literally couldn't put my camera down because I wanted to capture EVERYTHING!!! They even have a rock with a heart shaped cutout! So cute.. and ROMANTIC!!! Since one of my girlfriends came in flip flops we didn't hike too far but just enough to get a spectacular view of the bridge and the ocean! Don't worry, I saw plenty of small children AND pets complete this hike so it is very FAMILY/PET FRIENDLY! I would definitely recommend coming back here during a sunrise/sunset!

Apparently it went to hell in a hand basket as the owners lost money hand to fist, so much so that it was in complete disrepair by the time a suspicious fire completely destroyed what was left of it in 1966. If you've ever been to the elaborate baths in Budapest, you can get some idea of what the Sutro Baths were about in the gilded age.\n\nNow what you see are water-swept ruins of the foundation, nothing more. But it is worth perusing on a brisk day just to fantasize what a glorious attraction it must have been. Kind of like that scene where old Rose recalls the splendor of the Titanic from the barnacle-encrusted remains of the rusted shipwreck in that Leonardo movie I can't stand.\n\nYou should also take a stroll in the very moist cave tunnel to the right just to see the waves crashing on the rocks at the end, and there is a wide-open concrete terrace where if you cock your head, you can actually see one of the towers of the Golden Gate.

As being a person who really is fascinated by history, this is truly one of my favorite places to visit.  Amazing that these ruins were once large swimming pools that in their heyday were a major draw for tourists who came to San Francisco. This place is full of history. \n\nSadly, a suspicious fire in the 1960s burned down most of the building.  Some of the cement pools are still intact but have now full of marine life growing in them.  You can walk all throughout this area but it is somewhat dangerous. There is some vandalism that is evident on some of the ruins such as graffiti which is saddening to see. Anyhow, if you plan to go to see the Sutro Bath ruins be prepared to walk down a lot of stairs to see it.  It is good to be fit if you plan to do so.  \n\nOverlooking the Sutro Baths is the Cliff House which also is rich in history.  It is apparently a great place to eat as well.  Also, near by where there are condominiums now, was where the beachfront amusement park, Playland at the Beach was once located that closed down in the 1970s.\n\nPros:\n-a great place to visit if you love history and adventure\n-the famous Cliff House overlooks the Sutro Baths\n-great scenic view of SF Bay\n\nCons:\n-if you are not fit, the stairs are a long way down to the ruins and can take its toll on you\n-the ruins are exposed and if you are not steady on your feet this may not be a good place to go as you could fall into one of the existing pools I could imagine \n-not a safe place for children\n-some vandalism is evident", "author": "Irene S."}

When there, you feel like you've been transported to another time.  The ruins don't look like they're only 100 years old. They might as well be ancient (nevermind that the ruins are of concrete and steel, not stone). Add that to a backdrop of endless ocean, and you have something almost majestic-looking.\n\nMoving on to the facts: The best time to come here is *not* on the weekend, because the large crowd factor does take away from the experience a bit. I suggest coming right around twilight on a sunny day. \n\nYou can walk among the ruins, so obviously, your shoes should be good ones, as there are large gaps and the surface is uneven. And lastly, there are little coves and caves around the ruins that are worth checking out, too.

The views of the ocean are of course, gorgeous, and Fort Miley, The Legion of Honor, The Presidio, and numerous beaches are all relatively nearby. But as I see it, the real beauty of the site is the connection one can find to history and a long ago, much different world than the one we now live in. With a little imagination you can see what a bold and dramatic structure it must have been, challenging the elements as it faced out toward the Pacific. It's a shame that it didn't survive to today.\n\nI like to come here and sit and stare off into the distance, thoughts drifting, taking in the view. Having the ruins of a once proud and daring monument to human will on the scenic outreaches of a beautiful city, at the precipice of the largest body of water in the world at your feet, it's easy to get lost in thought. Whether you're interested in its history or the natural beauty of the area, Sutro Baths is a place to come to connect with something larger than yourself.\n\nJust remember to bring a jacket!

You can go up to a concrete walkway and get a glimpse of the GG Bridge, walk through a cave, or just wander around the ruins.  So beautiful, interesting, and fun!

There are no guard rails and all sorts of opportunities to tumble downhill.  Also there is some broken glass from beer bottles - it's not terrible, but it's there.

It's relatively inaccessible and the area doesn't have much of a draw other than a cold ocean with too many riptides.\n\nBut this past weekend, I found myself in the Outer Richmond at Sutros Baths with an out of town friend. Neither of us had been to the area previously and we walked among the ruins while listening to the crashing sounds of the ocean in the caves. We escaped the hustle and bustle of the city and decided to be different people for a short amount of time. We ran away from everything else in our lives to dig our toes in the sand, let the churning water lap hungrily at our ankles and marvel and the destructive beauty of nature.\n\nOverall, there's not much there. It's a pile of rocks with a trail that really is a lot more spectacular. However, it was nice to visit, to get away and find oneself at the edge of everything.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-19", "description": "We haven't visited the Sutro Baths area since they remodeled the dirt section and paved 2 parking lots. There's a staircase from the parking lot which leads you down to the remains of Sutro Baths and off to the right a tunnel which ends at the cliffs on the other side.  You can ascend further up to a huge platform area to admire the views and another staircase leads onto the coastal trail.\n\nI was enthralled by a pair of raptors (looked like Peregrine falcons but could've been hawks) hunting against the background of the dimming blue-gray evening sky. They would hover against the wind up above like kites, flying tandem, juxtaposed or one above the other, searching for prey in the ground cover below.  Occassionally, they would dive slovly down and hover closer to the ground or fly behind us near the Cypress trees and then ascend upwards and hover over the costal plants again.\n\nWe decided to take a hike the next morning along the coastal trail and end near Eagle's Point. Parts of this trail was actually a railroad line that rich Mr. Sutro had built to bring people from the Downtown area to enjoy the baths.  He created a resort area until a landslide shut down the rail line permanently in 1925.  \nWe've hiked this trail before from the other end and it was our first time from the Land's End direction. The Coastal Conservancy, a group of volunteers have done a marvelous ongoing job of replanting California natives in the ground.  Little colored blue and yellow flags dot the hills showing where baby plants have been planted.  The trail is an easy walk and ample runners and walkers are on the trail.  \n\nBring binoculars to see items in the ocean waters (saw the Radisson Silver Sea cruise ship coming in).  As you near the Painted Rock, you can see fragments of a sunken ship in the water.  It's mostly covered by brown moss but the long rectangular shape is definitely not a rock.  A hummingbird hovered nearby a small flower and you can hear the caw cawing of the large black birds in the trees.  \n\nWe took another flight of wooden stairs up to the USS SF Memorial.  There's a fragment of the ship there, in memorial of the 107 marines who died during WW II and one of 2 rear admirals who have ever been killed during wartime.  The view of the GG Bridge to the distant right and the ocean is spectacular from this parking lot view.  I've been here before on a sunny, clear day.  It's breathtaking.  \n\nNot much I can say about the Sutro Baths ruins. They sort of remind me of the Roman Baths in Bath, England, but worse.  Old photos in the Cliff House giftshop further down the hill gives you an idea how spacious, luxurious and decadent this place used to be.  The new Cliff House is home to 2 restaurants and quite pricey.  $11 for a bowl of homemade granola is an example of a breakfast item.  There was a crowd waiting for seating and willing to pay the price for an ocean view.  \n\nIt's a great way to spend a day outdoors and take in some nature, ocean breezes and to learn about a piece of our city's history.  The old Clift House and Playland are long gone now but you can be proud of what's in place and how it's been all fixed up.", "author": "Ry T."}

The cave-tunnel, has some sand in it, it's pretty dark when you get to the middle of it, but there is light at both ends of the tunnel, so it should be ok. There are a whole bunch of jagged rocks and water at the end of the tunnel and it's roped off, I saw a dude trying to navigate to see if he could go beyond, but I don't think he had much luck, and it's pretty dangerous.  \n\nThis might not be in my top ten san Francisco landmarks, but def worth stopping by if you're going to the cliff house/ocean beach/seal rock. Well, it would have been nice to see the Sutro baths if it still was there.... Sounds like it would have been pretty cool.\n\nyou can read up on the history here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutro_Baths", "author": "Irene C."}

Well, let me clarify: don't build a crappy, modern swimming pool.  Build a non-functioning replica of the original baths that acts as a museum (and not just of the baths--of all the kick-ass stuff from the Sutro glory days).\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love ruins.  There's nothing like a ruined abbey in the Irish mist (especially when your ancestors are buried there).  But Sutro Baths does not have the cool \"ruins\" atmosphere.  Sure, the caves here are great and all, but the actual foundations that are now little more than a concrete pool...well, it simply doesn't do justice to the former grandeur of the place.  The baths aren't the only landmark with this problem, either; I don't think the average visitor (or resident, for that matter) really comprehends the magnitude of some of the city's lost wonders.  I mean, there was a railroad at Lands End!  How cool is that?  \n\nNow maybe there's some museum elsewhere in the city that I've overlooked that covers this stuff, but if you ask me, the baths would be perfect, especially if the architecture of the place was a history lesson in and of itself.

It made her emotional. \n\nAnne claims to admire my cool exterior. If she only knew my demons. \n\nAt Sutro, the uneven ground put pressure on the ankles. Our wrists, knees, hips were tense and wobbly. My keys-- hitched to a clasp of my skirt-- made noise as we moved. \n\nI was overdressed for the outdoor walk. Anne isn't one to tease me for it.\n\nAnne's ultimate dare, it felt like we were in the 5th grade again: she wanted me to go into the thicket we saw ahead, alone. \n\nIt looked like tall standing trees, too closely together.

It's definitely on my list of fun and different (and free!) things to show visitors to SF, and it can be a great place to hang around for an hour or two on a nice sunny afternoon.\n\nIt is pretty steep in some areas, so do be careful and take your time moving around the ruins. I would not much relish falling into that water, and there are plenty of old iron bars sticking out of various cement blocks. \n\nOf course, that is part of the fun, isn't it? Scurrying around on old cement pylons and daring your friends to see if they can jump across... I hope that isn't the way that some horror story begins. In fact, if there were to be a wacky monster movie for San Francisco, the Sutro Baths would probably make a good set for the scene where the heroine and her dashing hero go to discover the monster's hidden secret: it is the tortured soul of Adolph Sutro come back to stalk the living for having forsaken the old-timey Victorian bathing gowns of the Baths!

My sister and girlfriend are in town from LA, and their friend Zach who lives in SF wants to play.  We go eat, and then head over to the Sutro Baths.  He gives us an option.  Do we want to climb on rocks or run through trees?  We choose rocks.  Now had I known what was in store for me i might not have put on my Chucks when deciding to wear sneakers.\n\nThe Sutro Baths are a great spot for visitors.  You can read about the history, and check out what it used to look like before it got destroyed.  You can also opt to take a more adventurous route and explore the tunnels and rocks.  That's what we did.  \n\nWe walked through the tunnel, and like i said, saw the rocks, and then decided to see how far we could go on these rocks.  Keep in mind its been pissing rain all day, and everything is a bit wet...and Chucks have NO traction.  But I'm no sissy so i followed the crowd.  Over rocks, climbing rocks, sliding down rocks, using my hands to find grip in the rock to pull myself up, finding cracks to put my feet to lower my self, etc...it was quite the workout.  It was beautiful.  The ocean to my left, a cliff to my right i just assumed that we would have to come back the way we came to get to the car.  I was wrong.  Further along there is this cliff like hill that wouldn't be terribly hard to get up if it were dry.  Wet however was another story.  I ended up with dirt in my nails holding on to the dirt and rock for dear life, and after a few foot slips, thought i wouldn't make it.  But being in the back of the pack, i didn't want to get forgotten about, so i pushed on and made it up. I  mean, what would my sister tell my mother?  A path back through the trees lay ahead, and in the distance was our car. In retrospect, it was awesome, at the time i though i might die, and the moral of the story is....next time, i wear shoes with traction.  \n\nBe careful, don't necessarily do what I did, but make sure you enjoy the nature out there for sure.
