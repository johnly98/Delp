Our waiter recommended the broiled yellowtail collar and while this was a bit tricky to share, the salsa that it came with was crazy delicious and paired well with the fatty fish.

A wonderful neighborhood restaurant with outdoor seating (though the outdoor seating has limited lighting and no heating-- so try to come early if you want to enjoy) that allows you to dine with your pup if you so choose. \n\nThey mostly have small plates and bites, with some larger plates if you feel in the mood for entrees. I was fine with sharing a couple small plates between my partner and myself and that was more than enough for the both of us. Delightful and delicious with attentive service! They have a poached chicken meal that is reminiscent of hainan chicken rice, and they forgot to add a sprinkling of peanuts on top, and the wait staff noted that, and ran immediately back to the kitchen to correct the error. It was something that I wouldn't have noticed (it wasn't listed on the menu) if they hadn't found out, but it shows that they are well-trained and have fine attention to detail. That was something that really spoke out to us, and they were also really kind and receptive to us bringing our dog, and even brought water out for him. \n\nThe chicken fried anchovies are delicious! Get them as a bite-- though they are perfect enough to share for 2. The tuna and uni tostadas are smaller in size, but each order comes with 2, and I'd recommend getting them. The roasted bone marrow is definitely hearty -- coming with TWO bone marrows instead of one. The achiote cured hamachi was also a favourite of ours; something that we will most likely order again. \n\nI'd love to come back for brunch or dinner again, as the wait staff was attentive, the dishes were scrumptious, and the atmosphere was beautiful.", "author": "Christa Lei S."}

My only critique is that there isn't much of a kim-chi flavor. \n\nFried Chicken Sandwich - By far one of my favorite fried chicken sandwiches in SF. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the breading is light yet extremely crunchy. I'm not a huge fan of the sourness from the slaw but it does make the overall dish taste fresh and light. I prefer Alta MSP's sauce/slaw which is a buttermilk flavor. \n\n\nSon's Addition is now on my list of \"go-to\" brunch places. Everything on the menu sounds appetizing and the dishes we ordered tasted amazing. There is an evident core set of flavors throughout the dishes: tanginess, freshness, and lightness; which gives the meal a cohesive feeling. \n\nIf you're a fan of Marlowe than you'll love Son's Addition. There are quite of few similarities between Marlowe and Son's Addition but what sets Son's Addition apart is the more relaxed atmosphere and the fusion oriented cuisine. Son's Addition, much like Marlowe, is a small trendy space with seating packed to the brim. The difference with the interior of Son's Addition is the industrial/NYC look is toned back, in favor of a more minimal and brighter color pallet, making the space feel roomier and brighter. \n\nI am huge fan of Son's Addition and wouldn't hesitate to go back.

Highly recommend you make a reservation since it's a smaller restaurant and definitely busy. The space is welcoming and hip with a small bar and open kitchen. I thought everything on the menu was very reasonably priced.\n\nDrinks: \nThe wine menu is extensive and descriptive so you'll definitely find something that will spark your interest. The menu is categorized by flavor profiles, so it's super easy for you find what you're looking for! We went through 2 bottles of the Pieropan Soave 2015. Crisp, refreshing and a perfect pair with both our lighter and savory dishes. \n\nFood:\n\nDeviled eggs: definitely start with this. Not a strong kimchi taste, but is smoky from the bacon and a little garlicky from the other ingredients. \n\nHamachi: pass. It was good but I definitely think there were better things on the menu. \n\nGrilled Spanish Octopus: Super interesting flavor! The curry yucca was an interesting pair with the octopus. This was a favorite dish.\n\nBeef tartare: Just enough seasoning to add flavor but still let the quality of the beef shine through. \n\nBurger: Perfectly juicy and medium rare! The bacon onion marmalade added the perfect savory and sweet bite. Served with fries and pickles- it's a steal at only $15\n\nFried chicken: The special of the night. We ordered 2 plates of it because it was so good!!! So juicy and crispy.\n\nPork Chop: Meh. It was cooked well but lacked flavor. Reading it's description we expected something a little bolder.\n\nLamb Shank: GET IT! My personal favorite dish of the night. A SUPER rich and flavorful dish. The goat cheese polenta was creamy and the perfect pair with the unbelievably tender lamb. If you like bold flavors, you will not be disappointed.\n\nDark Chocolate & sea salt cookies: Just when we thought things couldn't get better.....we had these. Rich, sweet, and just a little salty. If you're a fan of ooey gooey cookies you're gonna love these.\n\nService: \nSo nice and thoughtful. We got help from several different people in the restaurant and everyone was so kind.

(+$36)\n*Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms: with pecorino, balsamic gastrique ($9)\n*Crushed Avocado Toast: with arugula, fennel, lemon, olive oil, chili flakes and leek green togarashi ($10)\n*Fried Egg Sandwich: with black garlic aioli, bacon, jack cheese and charred avocado on seeded bread ($15)\n*Fried Chicken Sandwich: with cilantro slaw, mole aioli and cotija cheese ($15)\n*Spring Quiche: with english peas, wild mushrooms, bloomsdale spinach, leeks, and goat cheese ($14)\n*Buttermilk Biscuits and Chorizo Gravy: with avocado, cilantro and cojita cheese ($15)\n*Spicy Corned Beef Hash: with breakfast potatoes, braised kale, fresno chiles and poached egg ($14)\n*Seasonal Scramble: with asparagus, sunchokes, roasted spring onions, manchego and green garlic ($14) x2\n*Marin Sun Farms Burger: with white cheddar, bacon-onion marmalade and charred scallion aioli served with fries and house dills ($16)\n*Malted Waffle: with whipped satsuma butter ($13)\n*Muscato Sabayon: with mixed berry compote and brown butter streusel ($9)\n*Pineapple Cake: with whipped creme fraiche ($9)\n*Indiana Jones: not your average michelada ($9) x2\n*NV Bodegas Cruzat Brut, Pinot Noir / Chardonnay, Lujan de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina ($36) x4, Bellini (+$4)\n*Cappuccino ($5)\n*Drip Coffee ($4) x3\n*Orange Juice ($5)\n\nI saw uni and immediately wanted the tostadas. They were good, but I wish they had more uni. They was only a tiny bit on top, so hard to taste. And after going over our bill for this review, I realized we were charge $12 per order instead of the $11 listed on the menu. Also, for each round (we did two rounds of tostadas), we ended up with a surcharge. The first one was $12 and the second was $24. Not sure if that was to add the appropriate amount for the number of people at the table, but it ended up being $108 for I think 15 tostadas. A little pricey for what you get if you ask me. Moving on to the other food...\n\nI liked the fried chicken sandwich. Though I do have a weakness for any fried chicken sandwich. The chicken was nice and crispy and the slaw added a nice contrast. I also enjoyed the biscuits and gravy as it kinda reminded me of indian curry. It had a similar profile. And I find indian curry very comforting. The rest of the food, I just found okay. A lot of people were surprised about how much they liked the waffle as it looked so plain. I think it may have been the orange butter that elevated it a bit. For the cake, there was an orange almond cake listed for $8, but I think we ended up getting a pineapple cake instead? I took a small bite, so I don't remember it much.\n\nOur waitress was sweet. We had a big party, so she managed to serve us well. Especially since we like to drink. They have mimosas and bellinis on the menu, but we just decided to order bottles instead. She was sweet enough to give us the berry mix so we could make our own as I'm more of a bubbly purist. The indiana jones is a must if you like micheladas. They had a nice subtle spicy kick. Speaking of spice, if you like heat, make sure to ask for their two hot sauces. Definitely a good way to kick it up a notch on the savory dishes.\n\nFun brunch, but I wasn't really impressed with the food. Work checking out once though.", "author": "Elena N."}

Tucked away in the Mission district, this restaurant is comparable in quality to places like Progress or State Bird Provisions.  Walking in, I felt the local vibe as it wasn't overly crowded, but considering it was right after work, most people were grabbing a drink and a quick meal .\n\nThe Bacon kimchi egg  were simple, yet an explosion of flavor. Eggy, crispy bacon, low tones from the sesame oil, and a surprising spiciness at the end \n \nThe uni tostadas may have had some of the best avocados I've had.  So fresh and bright with Avocado flavor. The pickled vegetables and garlic sauce were just enough to compliment and not overwhelm. The tuna and uni were probably the least pronounced in the flavor. Although it's better that the fish flavor not be overwhelming, it didn't seem as pronounced as I would like. The chip that held everything was just the right amount of crunch. That may have been the textbook definition of what I would want from a mini tostada chip. The only problem is they give you two small chips. I was quite sad once I consumed them \n \nThe bone marrow was executed well. Not a soup and not a struggle scooping the marrow. A wonderfully rich beef flavor, with the right amount of garlic confit. The celery hearts were a little distracting, but they did give it some freshness and texture. The bread was super crispy, and initially tasted weird, but it blends well with everything after a second.  \n\nThe octopus was a solid choice, but they don't serve it as good as New York. it had a tender enough texture without being per se chewy, but some chew is there.

As I took in every bite, there were definitely some dishes that I liked and some just ok. The roasted bone marrow was a HUGE disappointment, as there was hardly any marrow on the bones.

Perhaps mustard for some flavor? The chips weren't the best vessel as they easily broke from the weight of the tartare.\n \n*Chicken Liver Toast Points w/ persimmon mustard, sea salt ($10): http://bit.ly/2jhNLzs\nLeast favorite dish. The chicken liver was missing that rich, complex flavor and bread was wet on the ends from the mustard seeds.\n\n*Roasted Bone Marrow w/ tomatillo, sea salt, garlic confit, celery heart ($15): http://bit.ly/2iruLgN\nWe were really sad about this dish - there was barely enough marrow (from both of the bones) for one of the toast points. My co-worker had the same issue when she visited the week before. \n\n*Five Spiced Braised Lamb Shank w/ goat cheese polenta, root greens, shiso gremolata ($25): http://bit.ly/2knlfjd\nCooked well - fork tender shank and creamy polenta...but too many strong, competing flavors and the shank itself was very salty. Five spice powder, goat cheese, [bitter] root greens, and shiso leaves all have pretty aggressive flavors alone IMO. When combined on a plate, it was very overwhelming.\n\nService was very kind and earnest. This is truly a neighborhood restaurant as the staff is warm and pretty attentive despite it being busy. I've been trying to get rid of a hacking cough and our server was nice enough to have the kitchen boil some hot water for me to drink. We had early dinner reservations so pacing of dishes was on point.\n \nFormerly a Salvadoran hole-in-the-wall, the owners have done a great job transforming the space into something bright and modern with some rustic touches. Not much sound dampening as it was pretty loud and hard to maintain a conversation. If you want a more quiet meal, it's probably best to come for an early weeknight dinner.\n\nOverall, I was hoping to have a 5 star experience like everyone else but like many new restaurants, Son's Addition is probably still finding their groove in the kitchen. Once they get their outdoor seating in place, I plan to revisit in a couple of months. By then, I hope to give a better update.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

It should be $2.50 for one egg, not $2.50 for half. Mine tasted okay but again, they were really small. My GF said hers was greasy, she mentioned how it was greasy 3 times during the dinner which was weird since mine was not. \n\nCharred Octopus-\nMy GF and I agreed that they should charge $6 less and remove the octopus from the dish. It is dark in the restaurant so I am unsure there was even any octopus in the dish, but the potatoes and sauce were great. \n\nChicken mousse toast-\nThis was the best dish we had, all the flavors worked well.\n\nHalibut-\nThe halibut was our main entree and it was not good. The halibut was overcooked and it was served on a bed of corn and vegetables, 100% sure these were the vegetables:\nhttps://www.birdseye.com/product/mixed-vegetables-4/\n\nTable-\nThe table was broken, instead of moving us from the broken table to the one next to us they tried to fix it for about 5 mins. They left the table so it was not level but they said it was better than leaving it bouncing around.\n\nWine-\nThey were out of Chardonnay, which was odd. When we were able to ask for two more glasses of wine, we asked for a blanca and got a Riesling. It was really loud and the tables are placed close together so that might explain the error. \n\nOverall, we wouldn't go back.", "author": "Josh H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-09", "description": "It's been awhile since I've dined at a hot new restaurant in SF! I have to thank my gal pal who is more attuned to the hot spots since I don't seem to be in the 'know' of the cool hip places. \nAnyway, it was her birthday celebration, so we came to Son's Addition to celebrate, and by golly, did we have a wonderful birthday feast!!\n\nAs I mentioned in my quick tip, definitely make reservations. The bar area is quite small and towards the back of the restaurant. The kitchen is semi-open, so you can see the chefs working hard to prepare the amazing dishes with such precision and care. The space is quite nice and simplistic, and they utilize every ounce of it. We sat in the middle section of the restaurant surrounded by other 2 top tables. Don't be surprised if you're sitting right next to another party. I'd request the corner tables in the front if you want to have more space and feel less crammed. \n\nThe menu is split into 3 sections, from Bites and Raw; Small Plates; and Large Plates. Since we practically ordered everything on the menu, here are my must orders:\n\n1) Pork Chicharron - I'm filipina, so of course, I'm going to order this. Serving is a bit smaller than anticipated, so might want to order a few so you don't fight over who gets the last piece. Crispy and savory chicha goodness! You won't be disappointed. The spicy fermented salsa wasn't that spicy, and that's to my liking since I'm not a spicy fan.\n\n2) Tuna and Uni Tostada - You taste more than tuna over the uni, and this is bite sized so it fits in the palm of your hand. Best to get two orders of these, especially if you are a party of 4. \n\n3) Brussels Sprouts Panzanela - This was one of my favorites, as I love my brussels. Good savory flavor with the baby beets, goat cheese and pistachios. The sourdough croutons are the best part. The flavor combination is so on point! Bursting with amazing flavor and goodness!\n\n4) Chicken and Crispy Skin- with Coconut Rice. I was expecting more of the crispy skin, but it was crisp to perfection and the chicken is quite tender and juicy. \n\n5) Pork Chop - Tender and juicy goodness. This is served with butternut squash, bacon brussels sprout ragu... as if I couldn't get enough of the yummy brussels! \n\n6) Black Cod - This was another favorite of mine. The fish was so delicate and melt in your mouth. Great flavor, too as it's served with celery root, delicata squash, leek, kimchi romensco. \n\n7) For dessert  - get the dark chocolate and sea salt cookies and the Moscato Sabayon- poached french butter pear and brown butter streussel. The pear (seasonal) is perfectly poached and paired with the brown butter streussel. Oh mylanta! It's not too sweet, nor too heavy. The perfect happy sweet ending to an amazing meal.  \n\nGreat selection of wines by the glass and bottle. I had a lovely Rose since I wanted something light and fruity. Nice service with friendly, attentive staff! Prices are reasonable, and you're paying for quality and amazing food!\n\nYou've got a winner in the Mission! Congrats Son's Addition! You guys have hit a home run!\n\nCheers my dears!", "author": "Gill C."}

I was very happy with the owners' ability to accommodate last minute reservations. And I was thoroughly impressed with the dishes coming out of the kitchen. \n\nStarted off with a couple of bites:\n-Bacon-kimchi deviled eggs with green onion and black sesame seed\n-Tuna & uni tostada with charred avocado, picked red onion, radish, cilantro, hazelnut dukkah, and miso- black garlic sauce\n\nBoth were light and refreshing and really whet the appetite\n\nFor small plates tried:\n-Poached chicken and crispy skin with coconut rice with fermented soybean salsa\n-Chicken liver mousse toasts with persimmon mustard, sea salt and lavender honey \n\nHands down the chicken and rice was my favorite of the evening- love coconut rice. Chicken liver mousse toasts were a pleasant balance of flavors\n\nFor large plates, tried:\n-Heritage pork chop with butternut squash, bacon-brussels sprout ragu, pecan mole\n-Pan roasted black cod with celery root, delicata squash, leek, kimchi romesco\n-Marin Sun Farms burger with white cheddar, bacon-onion marmalade, Romaine lettuce, tomato confit, and charred scallion aioli served with fries and house dills\n\nEach plate was succulent and unique and all flavorful- just depends what you're in the mood for - pork if you want hearty, fish if you want light, or burger if you're looking for comfort. I enjoyed them all! You can't go wrong because the quality and execution are on-point and really raise the bar on these types of dishes. \n\nUnfortunately I didn't try the desserts which were limited and not calling to me.

This dish should not be on the bites section; it's probably more appropriate as an appetizer. The dish consists of thick slices of pork belly, cooked to perfection (nice crispy texture on the outside) and fried pork rinds on top. Unfortunately the pork rinds were not as crispy; they were a little stale. Overall it was a good dish. We also tried the kimchi deviled eggs and the tuna-uni tostada. Both were excellent dishes and very tasty. The tostada was super tiny thou! \n\nFor the main course, we tried the pork chop and the lamb shank.

This was the best dish of the night. \n\nRest of the dishes:\n- Tuna uni tostada - Husband said it was delicious.\n- Chicken liver toast - I'm not into pate, and this was pretty good.\n- Chicken fried quail - Really good. The skin was crisp, and the bird was well seasoned. It was a little difficult to eat because it was so small, but we used our hands and just went for it.\n- Bone marrow - This was pretty disappointing. It was served with roasted garlic that we were instructed to spread on the crostini before putting the bone marrow on top. Don't do it! Also, the bone marrow had celery leaves on it. Scrape that off! Everything took away from the bone marrow flavor. We tried it the recommended way, which just ended up tasting like garlic and celery on a crostini. For the second crostini, I left everything off and just spread the bone marrow on it, which was much better. But there wasn't enough bone marrow to cover two crostinis per person. \n\nLastly, the cocktails leave something to be desired. I assume they didn't have a liquor license. The bubbly was good though!", "author": "Jaching H."}

Everything we tried was either epic or good, not a single disappointment. \n\nWe started with the bacon kimchi deviled eggs and they were phenomenal, hopefully they will be on the menu for quite a while! Next was a tuna ahi tostada which was also pretty amazing, just an amazing combination of flavors and texture in a single bite.\n\nThen it was onwards and upwards with their roasted bone marrow, almost impeccable in preparation. Our next small plate, the beef tartare was missing something, and just a squeeze of lime did the trick, and this was probably the only \"just good\" item on the menu.  We finished our meal by sharing the heritage pork chop and it was sumptuous, zero complaints.\n\nReally divine meal, and all the items paired well with some glasses of their Malbec.  Our waiter was really knowledgeable and attentive without ever being overbearing, really friendly vibe.\n\nWe got there on the early side and by the time we left, the dining room was full.

The ambiance is lovely & bright, the servers and staff are super friendly! We were taking a break from our vigorous exercise and decided to stop in for bubbly and brunch. The menu is amazing and I cannot wait to go back! Most dishes between $10-15 for brunch, which is average for SF. My mom had the corned beef hash and it was literally the best I've ever had! Spicy and delish!!! The braised kale was a lovely touch too. They were very accommodating of her request for scrambled eggs over poached. I had the fried chicken sandwich which was excellent but I think missing a little something - pickles or spice or something. The fries were also really delicious!!

We all enjoyed the meal and almost all the dishes that we ate family-style.\n\n- Tuna & Uni Tostadas: Delicious and perfect bite size as a starter for everyone.\n- Beef Tartare: I wished the portion was bigger than the number of chips on the dish because the beef tartare was delicious with a citrus kick.\n- Brussels Sprouts Panzanela: there were sourdough bits along with brussel sprouts which were good until I tasted the goat cheese (which I'm not a fan of). For those who like goat cheese, this would be a good order, but because I tasted it in every bite, I didn't eat more than one scoop. However, the bread bits with the brussels is a good combo.\n- Achiote Cured Hamachi: flavored with pineapple-coconut water, peanuts, and spicy chile on top. I couldn't handle that spicy, so I ate everything around it and it was light and delicious.\n- Roasted Bone Marrow: garlic was all over this, and I sure do like my garlic. This was super flavorful and I would reorder this in a heartbeat. Smearing the garlic over the small toast and then topping it with the bone marrow was a party in my mouth. \n- Poached Chicken and Crispy Skin: mmm another good dish to reorder! The crispy skin was a perfect texture and flavor paired with the chicken coconut rice. I love coconut rice so I definitely was a fan.\n- Chicken Liver Mousse Toasts: Another great dish. Chicken liver has been a part of my life growing up eating banh mi with it so I was looking forward to this dish when we ordered it. The flavor was delicious with the touch of persimmon mustard and the toast was a good pairing with it. Highly suggest ordering if you're a fan of liver mousse.\n- Pan-fried Black Cod: Very unique with a kimchee flavor, but the fish was good well with lots of flavors. Good option for fish lovers.\n- Five Spice Braised Lamb Shank: I am not a fan of lamb so I didn't indulge, but my friends were fans of the tender, soft meat. There was also goat cheese polenta below it which made me not want to try even more.\n- Marin Sun Farms Burger: Delicious & has fries but by the time this dish arrived, I was too full. Though I did pick at the yummy fries :)\n- Muscato Sabayon: This dessert had a pear with brown butter streusel and it was delicious. Desserts were on point. \n- Orange-Almond Cake: Almond cake? Yum! With small sweet orange pieces on top. Delicious!\n\nOverall, great food with great people. Service was ok, since we had to ask a few times to get the check. We all left full and satisfied.", "author": "Amanda C."}

According to the article, the chef used to be the head chef at Marlowe. I'd been to Marlowe and loved it, so I wanted to give this place a try.\n\nSon's Addition is located in the Mission, near the original Philz location. Street parking only, but I'd say it wasn't too hard to find parking. The interior is lit pretty dim, with candlelight at each table. Blue and white patterned tiles adorn the bar areas. Good for a date, and also saw some families with children. \n\nGood wine collection, and there's also a small bar seating area (I'd say enough to fit about 5-6 people). I ended up ordering a Pinot from Sonoma, my own way of supporting wineries that may have been affected by the Sonoma/Napa fires. Also plenty of foreign wine to choose from.\n\nFor food, got a bunch of small bites to begin:\n- (1) Bacon-Kimchi Deviled eggs: crispy bacon and spicy/garlic-y flavor of kimchi complements the smooth deviled eggs very well.\n- (2) Roasted Bone Marrow: they recommended smooshing the roasted garlic onto the crispy bread,  and then spreading the bone marrow on top. It was good, and even more refreshing than the bone marrow dish I had at Marlowe.\n- (3) Spicy Beef Tartare: not that spicy, but flavorful overall. Came with radish yukon potato chips, which  went perfectly with the tiny cubed tartare bites. I'm not that big on tartare in general, but this was good.\n- (4) Little Gem Lettuce: I have not had chicories and goat cheese together in a salad before, and they went really good together. I think it also had sunflower seed or pine nuts (couldn't tell which) which were also good -- but if you're allergic to nuts, make sure you ask. \n\nTo finish off, we shared the following:\n- (5) Marin Sun Farms Burger: came with fries and house dill (wasn't too salty) that were good. Burger itsef was a little heavy for my taste, but still good. We got it medium rare, and it was perfect.\n\nThroughout our entire meal, the staff made sure to make us feel well taken care of. Rarely had an empty glass of water for longer than a few minutes, but at the same time didn't rush us to order more or get out faster than we wanted to. \n\nAll in all, food was great. Couldn't try dessert because we were full to the brim, but would love to return sometime and order perhaps one less small dish so we can fit in a dessert dish! The whole check came out to something like $73 before tip, and I'd say it is worth every dime. Looking forward to going back!", "author": "Soo Jung R."}

I asked her the meaning of the name, and she said that she and the chef had 2 daughters, and debated between having a 3rd kid (aiming for a son) or open a restaurant... The menu is an eclectic mix of ethnic foods. Being a Korean, I was curious who made the Kimchee and how they learned it. The chef explained that he learned it himself by reading about it. Rather than shying away from being questioned about it, he sent a bowl of his plain kimchee (which is used as an accent on the menu for various dishes) to let us sample it and give feedback. Talk about someone who is open and confident. The kimchee was excellent, if a little under-fermented.\n\nAnyway we greatly enjoyed ourselves--the staff did a nice job of helping us pick out fun things on the menu (all super delicious--I especially liked the octopus) and also were excellent with the wine.

Rare and welcome!\n\nWe were searching for an affordable date night restaurant and found this new gem from the former chef of Marlowe. Upon walking in for our reservation, it turned out our table wasn't quite ready so the friendly host walked us over to the bar, and as soon as a seat opened up there, made sure we got to score it. Very thoughtful especially since we were only there for a moment before the table opened up. Bartender was super friendly and gave great wine recommendations (beer and wine only FYI).\n\nOur waiter was also top notch and passed our fav waiter test when asked whether we ordered too much or too little. We love it when a waiter prevents us from over ordering because we have very big eyes. Kudos for honesty! \n\nFor food, the Tuna and Uni tostada are scrumptious as everyone here seems to agree. The Roasted Hen of the Woods Mushrooms are delightfully flavorful. We took our waiter up on the Poached Chicken with Crispy Skin recommendation and were not disappointed. We shared the Black Cod which was tasty, but the Kimchi Romesco is what really made it.

The beets were more abundant than the sprouts as served to me; but that was alright as I love beets.  The goat cheese lent a bit of a sour taste to the salad; this isn't a complaint but rather a comment, as my next course also veered to the sour end of the taste spectrum.\n\nBraised lamb shank with polenta and goat cheese was fall-off-the-bone tender.

Good thing we had a reservation because the place was packed!\n\nWe began by each ordering a glass of wine (no liquor license, so just wine and beer). Next, we each began the meal with a deviled egg. These were a spectacular way to get the salivary glands working! We all were excited for what was to come next. From the Small Plates, the four of us shared the curried octopus, Hen of the Woods mushrooms, and poached chicken with fried skin. \n\nThe texture of the octopus was smooth, soft, and tender--flavor heavily dominated by coconut milk and curry. \n\nHen of the Woods mushrooms were earthy and roasty. \n\nPoached Chicken with Fried Skin was a variety of textures: soft poached chicken; crispy skin; multiple types of rice. Flavors were bright ginger and soy--reminiscent of sushi.\n\nFor the mains we opted for the Skirt Steak and Petrale Sole. \n\nThe Sole was crispy and browned on the exterior but was tender and flaked apart when cut. The accompanying creamy artichoke sauce was my highlight of the night. Snow peas added crisp & crunchy texture to the soft dish.\n\nSkirt Steak: crushed rainbow baby potatoes were crispy and were buddied up next to asparagus situated beneath the rare steak medallions which were draped with uni butter. This was an earthy, rich, and satiating dish. \n\nThe finale was two desserts: the dark chocolate chip cookies (2) and the Muscato sabayon with berry compote. The cookies came out warm, crisp on the outside and gooey on the inside. The sabayon was light, not too sweet and paired well with the sweet and tart berry compote. The whole berries in the compote exploded with fruitiness while swimming amidst the creamy, foamy, richness of the sabayon.\n\nWhat a meal! What an experience. Service was nice but over-extended.

We thought \"what the hey let's just get a drink\" given that neither of us were hungry. We walked in and decided to sit at the bar despite their table availability as per our decision to merely get a glass of wine. At the bar, I ordered a champagne cocktail and my fianc\u00e9 ordered one of their aperitifs. Both drinks were absolutely wonderful and with our current state of awe we gave in and indulged on some food, yet share plates. We chose wisely and selected the little gem lettuce salad, the pan roasted black cod, and the orange-almond cake, respectively. As each plate arrived, we took in what we thought to be a very delicious concoction of foods and flavors. The little gem salad was to die for! If only they had a branch in Los Angeles, I'd come for this salad! The dressing was exquisite and the pairings of bitters and watery crisps combined with nuts and pears was so memorable. They did a stellar job on that. The cod was beyond anything I've ever had. The fish just melted in my mouth and I was sad when the fish was fully devoured as I stared at an empty plate reminiscing on the fish that once laid there. If I could just go back in time and re-eat it... Lastly, the orange almond cake was the most interesting. We realized you had to spread the fraiche the cake before you ate it. It's a combined flavor. Once we figured that out, it was again, an interesting success. We ended our meal with a digestif, I can't remember which one.

I came late and on my own, so I got an instant seat at the bar.  The service was very good at the bar - I would no sooner finish a glass or a plate and they would ask if I wanted anything else.  My food came very quickly - I was still sipping on my glass of white when my burger came.  I ordered:\n\n* 1 deviled egg: $2.50\n* 1 burger + fries: $16.00\n* 2 glasses of wine $10-15 per glass\n* salted caramel chocolate chip cookies: $6\n* amaro: $6\n\nThe deviled egg was a little bight of bliss.  At this price point I'm comparing it to an oyster, and it stood up nicely and definitely got my appetite going.\n\nThe burger is rich, but simple.  In this burger the toppings are only there accent the meat, which in my case was cooked perfectly.  There are no tomatoes, or raw onions to stand out - just a delicious aeoli-based sauce and some chopped iceberg lettuce for texture.  The result is a burger that feels a bit like a steak from a steakhouse, literally dripping with umami.  You'll need to soak the sauce up with your fries.\n\nOn the cookies: they're heavy on the chocolate chips, and baked fresh, so the chocolate is melted inside.  Good luck keeping your hands clean.  I was searching the menu for a desert wine and saw the amaro option, which I recommend if you enjoy digestifs.\n\nEverything I ordered was simple, but well executed.  I'll definitely be coming back.", "author": "Thomas R."}

I would have expected in any other restaurant that they would have left us the dish and remedied the neighbors' issue separately.\n\nAfter we made eye contact with the waitress, who was being filled in on the situation, she loudly and brusquely asked \"do you have something to say to me\". We had to recount the situation to her while our neighbors seated very close by listened. The manager then came over to try and smooth things over and offered to bring us a glass of wine, which both didn't arrive (had to be ordered again) and wasn't comped (though in fairness, the disputed dish ended up being removed).  The rest of the meal was so uncomfortable after having this \"argument\" with the table next to us, made worse that we had to wait another 15 minutes without food for the dish that had already been on our table before.\n\nWe were initially excited by the menu and by a new restaurant in our neighborhood, but we won't be back to any restaurant that treats their guests so tactlessly.", "author": "Jennifer M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-02-26", "description": "The ingredients used at this restaurant are typical for San Francisco brunch places.  The food itself is an assembly / basic cooking of the ingredients - nothing more, nothing less.  \n\nI would have had a much better experience if our water (Charles N) didn't voluntarily suggest alternatives from the menu when I was placing my order.  Throughout lunch, I witnessed the waiter voluntarily offer alternatives to the tables to both my left and right.  The waiter seemed to have specific alternatives he personally preferred over every dish.  It was a pattern of \"Oh, if you're thinking of getting ____, you should get the ____ instead.  It's a similar dish, but MUCH better.\"  In reality, he was simply trying to sway people towards dishes that fit his personal taste.  \n\nI was excited to order the crushed avocado toast, and instead, the waiter suggested I ordered the tuna & avocado tostadas.  He said the only difference was one came with tuna, and was a lot more flavorful.  What he did not mention, was that the tostadas would literally be two 1-bite crackers, whereas the avocado toast is a full-sized thick toaste, topped with a generous amount of avocado.  When it arrived, the table to our left quickly cancelled their tostada order, commenting that they had no idea the waiter had swayed them into ordering 2 small bites, at basically the same price.  \n\nI'm sure the waiter had every best intention in mind, but at a certain point, the restaurant needs to train their staff to differentiate between providing input on dish suggestions, vs. trying to sway the customer in other directions without providing sufficient details. \n\nLater, the waiter asked us how we liked the tostadas.  I told him I would have much preferred the avocado toast because of its size (we were hoping to share the dish as an appetizer for the table), and also the taste.  The miniscule amount of diced tuna added virtually nothing in flavor to the crackers + almost translucent spread of avocado on top of the 2-inch diameter cracker.  VERY little for a dish that's over $10.  His only response was \"Oh, I'm sorry you didn't like it.\"\n\nThe waiter made no attempt to offer a solution.\n\nLater, another waiter asked me if I'd like to order anything to drink.  I asked if they had mint tea, to which he said yes and took down the order.  20 minutes later, I followed up on the status of the tea, since I was almost finished with breakfast, and the waiter said \"oh yeah, I didn't bring it out because I found out we don't carry mint tea.\" . . . wouldn't you think they should approach me with that information, as opposed to just not following up on an order?\n\nAdvice to management: Better train your staff to meet the expectations of standard brunch service in San Francisco.", "author": "Colette C."}

My bf and I wanted to eat at a new restaurant that wouldn't break the bank for a casual Fri night, and having looked at the menu ahead of time, it looked pretty decent.\n\nFood:\nOverall, pretty good food, but also nothing super exciting that stood out. \n-Tuna and uni tostada - ($10) probably our favorite dish. Tuna tartare type dish with small chip tostada, great but small.\n-Brussel Sprouts Panzanela ($10) - warm brussel sprout salad with yellow beets, goat cheese and sour dough. This was a good dish, but also tasted like something we could make at home. Beets were great, sour dough had a chewy inside with crispy outside, and brussel sprouts nice and tender.\n-Pork Chop ($22) - my bf liked the flavor for it. \n-Pan roasted black cod ($20) - I liked it, simple dish though.\n\nValue:\nThis restaurant has excellent value, for the style of the dishes. This is quite a rarity in SF these days. Our total bill came out to maybe $80, and with tax/tip, less than 50 a person. Wow. This included 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and corkage of $20. \n\nService:\nYou can tell that although their service is very friendly, they are all new to the restaurant business, and don't really know what they're doing yet. My bf brought a bottle of wine from home. They didn't tell us about the corkage fee (we always expect to pay regardless), and also when our waiter tried to open our bottle at the table, he broke our cork. They took our bottle away, and after 15 mins our bottle returned - they had to use a cheesecloth to get the wine out. I mean, things like this don't really bother me too much, but it just shows their staff isn't really trained in the restaurant industry. This situation would have never happened at Nopa, etc. Also, after we were done with our appetizer, a bus boy took away our share plates, and gave us new share plates. Then our entree arrived, and the waiter had to say to us, \"can you move the plates? Thank you.\" Again, these small little things don't really matter to me, but show that the owner hasn't really thought of the cadence of restaurant flow, or perhaps staff has not been adequately trained yet. \n\nAmbiance: \nLooks really cute when you walk in, but once you sit down you begin to notice that this restaurant feels that it was built on a budget. My booth seat was fine, but my bf complained of sitting on a flimsy chair the whole night. Also, we were seated at a regular table right by the bar seating, and there was very tight clearance between my bf's seat and the bar seating. Thus, the whole meal consisted of a lot of people trying to get through to the bathroom, waiters trying to clear tables and get through, customers trying to get to their table - while bumping into my bf's chair the whole night. \n\nVerdict:\nOverall, our prediction is that this restaurant won't be able to survive. Also, if you're not a foodie, or really into great value when dining out, you might like this restaurant a lot. But if you are a big restaurant-goer like myself, you might think otherwise.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

For SF, a city of snooty and smug waitstaff, the service was really outstanding - a special thanks to Anna who is one of the owners, for paying serious attention to a food allergy and saving us a painful evening. The food is fantastic, especially for the price. Those 2 elements plus a cozy and charming interior make it 5 star. We had a truly great birthday dinner here, for 3 people (including a young teen) and ordered tons of food and wine - for maybe $180. We've eaten at many spectacular restaurants across the US and around the world, and we think Son's is a serious contender for greatness. (Just don't get too big for your boots and lose the fabulous service!)\n\nContrary to comments from another poster, the couple who own Son's are very experienced SF restaurant folks who've held positions at Marlowe, Maverick, Anzu, Jardiniere, etc. It shows. The Brussels sprouts dish, the mushrooms, the pate, and the burger were delectable. Our favorite was the lamb shank - soooo good - but there was one misstep, the polenta in that dish was horribly cheesy and all wrong for the shank. Unsophisticated. The only misstep of the meal. \n\nThe cookies are super good - and when we didn't order dessert because we were all too full, they just gave us some with a birthday candle. Very nice touch. \n\nNote that this area of 24th is filled with fun little stores and taco spots and a couple of okay bars, but actually kind of limited if you arrive early and want to grab a drink. And you'll definitely want to make a res - it was jam packed by 6:30 on the Sat we were there, and stayed crushed until we left at 9+.  Keep up the good work Son's!", "author": "Sarah W."}

The food was delicious, but some of the most intriguing ingredients (the kimchee in the deviled eggs and the kimchee romesco with the black cod) were undetectable. Our wines (a Fiddlehead ros\u00e9 and an Amplify red) were lovely. The service was charming but uneven. It took a long time to get waited on, and one course went missing. Our server more than made up for it by apologizing and comping some items. My only real complaint is about the noise level -- it is not a place for a quiet conversation. Some sound baffling would be a huge help. \n\nI agree with Michael Bauer's review in the SF Chronicle, though I'd give the place 3 stars (on their 4-star scale) rather than 2.5.

We were looking for a new spot to grab dinner with a friend who was in town, and it was just a short hop from Noe Valley where we were hanging out. We decided to call and ask for a reservation to pop in here --\u00a0which we got one, though it was later at night.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was that the place is definitely a loud one. We had a lot of trouble just hearing each other talk across the table, and it seems to have that kind of feedback loop where it gets louder and louder as people start yelling to overhear each other. The kitchen is exposed to the rest of the restaurant, so you can peek over and see what's happening behind the scenes. The aesthetic of the place is great and the staff is pretty attentive, but it can just feel pretty hectic at times.\n\nThe dishes were definitely on the pricier side. They're kind of the price levels you'd expect for a higher-end restaurant like Saru or Foreign Cinema in San Francisco, but I felt like the atmosphere and quality of the meal just didn't sum up to other comparably priced restaurants. We ordered the Kimchi deviled eggs, which were delicious, but in the end just seemed like an unnecessary splurge. The rest of the meal was good, but not so amazing that I would walk home and remember the meal fondly and crave it a lot in a few months.\n\nThere's nothing particularly bad about this place other than the noise level, and the food is in the sort of A- range, but I think the price was a little high given the return on spend. I'd recommend it in a pinch if you're looking for something upscale, but otherwise do your research when you're planning your big celebrations --\u00a0and make sure you have reservations.", "author": "Matthew L."}

It has a pretty spacious open feel despite it being a smaller place - I think the capacity said 49 people, but it felt bigger than this. I think it helps to have a bar area and reasonably spaced out tables.\n\nIt was pretty much full on a Sunday night, so it was good that we had a reservation via Open table.\n\nDrinks: \nBeer and wine only. They have some pretty reasonably priced wines by the bottle - we had a French Cotes du Rhone/GSM and then the \"Reckless Love\" cabernet sauvignon/syrah blend from California.\n\nFood: we did everything family style.\n- Bacon and kimchee deviled eggs: subtle but present kimchee flavor, and the yolk was not overly creamy. The crispy bacon was a good pop of texture. Overall, a good starter, but my only complaint is that each half is $2.50.\n- Tuna and uni tostada: 2 per order, with charred avocado and pickled red onion - lots of flavors and textures, none of which were dominating, and all of them complemented each other well\n- Little gem salad: the pears were good, but it was a little over dressed for me \n- Beef tartare: the meat was a little tough, but it good flavor (mustard, black garlic), served with chips \n- Grilled Spanish octopus: with curried yucca and braised celery, leek togarashi. The octopus was charred nicely, and the curry was well balanced. Not surprisingly, the octopus was the standout part of the dish\n- Roasted hen of the woods mushrooms: with pecorino and balsamic gastrique. The flavor was really good on this.\n- Poached chicken: with crispy chicken skin over rice; the fermented soy bean salsa was awesome for flavor. This dish reminded me of Hainan chicken rice. We ended up liking it so much we got a 2nd order. The rice was very solid. \n- Pork chop: the butternut squash and bacon-brussels sprouts ragu were my favorite part; the pork itself was pretty tender and was well cooked \n- Pan roasted black cod: a small-ish piece. The delicata squash base was nice, but I couldn't taste the kimchee romesco much \n- Marin Sun Farms burger: white cheddar, bacon onion marmalade, charred scallion aioli, awesome fries. Since the chef was previously at Marlowe, and I loved their burger, I had to try this one, and it did not disappoint.\n\nDessert: \n- Dark chocolate and sea salt cookies: two chocolate chip cookies with sea salt; a little sweet for me, but everyone else liked them \n\nI was a little turned off by service, as our server was hard to flag down. However, everyone else working there did help to step in and do things like take our extra wine order, bring/pour the wine, refill waters, etc.  Everyone else in the staff was very warm and friendly, but I didn't get the feeling from our server. \n\nAs for food, I would skip the cod and the salad. Everything else we got was worth trying at least once.  I will definitely come back for the tostadas, the poached chicken + crispy skin rice, and the burger.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

I am a sucker for uni and bone marrow and both of these dishes are prepared in ways that have me falling in love with them all over again! The chicken liver is probably the best I have ever had! \n\nIf you are not that adventurous there are plenty of staples that you will live too. The brussel sprout panzanella with beets will make anyone believe super foods are more than just a trend, they are delicious! The poached chicken with chicken skins is the sort of comfort food my mom wish she could make. And the beer and wine list had my mouth watering from the get go.", "author": "Dan V."}

I think our favorite might have been the hamachi which was served with greens and in a light coconut milk sauce, but the poached chicken and crispy skin and the beef tartare were close seconds.  I appreciated that the creative dishes went beyond just tasting good.  The flavors and textures were complex.  The food was well plated and the waitstaff explained each dish as they brought it out.\n\nBy San Francisco standards, the meals are typically priced for this level of dining.  The restaurant has a good number of tables with good lighting and atmosphere.", "author": "Jim M."}

The menu is diverse and sophisticated. We had a few different dishes and judging off those I'm sure everything on the menu is delicious, but we especially enjoyed the bacon kimchi deviled eggs and beef tartare. Nice, well-rounded wine selection and appreciated how they had them organized on their menu. The owners and staff are really friendly and were happy to answer our questions. The candles and modern chandeliers created a cool ambiance, makes for a great date location. Will definitely be back!", "author": "Tiffany K."}

The restaurant is located in the South Mission - parking isn't easy (but where is it in SF?). We ordered three small plates and an entree. Really recommend the roasted hen of the woods mushrooms; our bone marrow with celery was pretty scant of the good stuff in the bone, so that's probably hit or miss. The brussel sprout panzanella was pretty tasty, but needed a hit of Maldon salt to bring out the flavors. The burger was beyond fantastic, as you'd expect from Marlowe alums. It was overcooked on the first try, but the revised burger was perfect, and the accompanying fries were fantastic. We also tried the mandarin orange gluten-free cake - great flavor but a little heavy for us. \n\nOne quip on the service - no need to clear our table the second a dish looks almost finished.", "author": "MichLee A."}

Overall, I'll give it high marks for the taste and quality of the food. I definitely want to come back and check out the dinner menu. Here's what we had for brunch:\n- Kimchi deviled eggs: Tasted pretty good but they were super small and $2.50 / half egg. I'll probably not order this again just because I thought it was too much to pay for a small bite.\n- Seasonal scramble: Hearty portion, fully of seasonal vegetables and soft scrambled eggs. Not greasy and tasted good.\n- Quiche - Good size slice of quiche with a mixed greens salad on the side. Fresh, cheesy and flavorful. Great crust.\n- Malted waffle - When this arrived, we were quite disappointed by it's appearance - three waffle triangles with a dollop of butter and a pot of syrup. No berries or any other toppings, not even on the side. However, the waffle was the winner of the day for me. When something looks this plain, it better taste good and the malted waffle delivered for sure. Airy and flavorful. I never order waffles but I might go back to get this instead of having to steal from my mom's plate :)\nGood food and I'll probably be back to check out the rest of the food soon.", "author": "Christina A."}

While they have only been open 5 weeks, they appeared to be running just fine with a completely full house. The environment is simple and tasteful.\n\nWe ordered the Pork Chop and the Lamb Which were both excellent. The pork chop was juicy without any overpowering ingredients as compliments on the plate. \n\nThe lamb was absolutely fork tender and flavorful. My only critique was there was a little bit too much fresh mint included all over the dish and the intense flavor as well as the different texture didn't really work as well with the dish, in my opinion.\n\nWe didn't explore anything else on the menu but they have done a great job with what we sampled. I would absolutely recommend these two dishes if dining here.", "author": "Aaron L."}

We started with the deviled eggs (MUST GET), then proceeded to split the poached chicken with coconut rice, roasted hen of the woods, black cod with sunchokes and the Brussels sprouts panzanela. We finished by splitting all three desserts. Each dish was unique, flavorful, and creative, while still having a hint of a soothing \"comfort food\" feel to it. The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly and their wine selection is fantastic and reasonably priced. All in all, this is one of the best meals I've had in San Francisco and this place is sure to be a staple to all future trips to NorCal. My only issue right now is that, as I type this review, I am dying for all of this food and regretting that it'll be at least a few more months before I can go here again.
