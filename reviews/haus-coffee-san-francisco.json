The iced coffee is not the best in the world (or I am possibly just not a fan of the Ritual Coffee Roaster beans that they use for it), as I found it a bit too \"fruity\" or to my possibly underdeveloped palette, sour. However, I do like grabbing coffee here out of convenience and to enjoy the brief, quaint atmosphere I have in it before going on with my daily obligations (it beats waiting awkwardly in a limited, crowded and cluttered space at Philz a couple of blocks away).\n\nI would recommend Haus baristas to try and change up their iced coffee's beans blend, possibly to something more full-bodied, deeper, or nuttier/smokier in flavor!\n\nA small situation happened today where I was rung up by an older barista who thought I ordered an iced latte and overcharged me for it. However, the second barista was kind enough to return the difference to me, but I ended up having them keep it for their continual amicable services.", "author": "Victoria W."}

Hipster cafe with outdoor seating.\n\n- Fast internet and down-to-earth staff, always cool to have a casual conversation. \n\n- Especially love their toasts (spread on artisan breads) for $4 & home-baked cookies. So far I've tried Sprouted Rye, Walnut Levain, Sprouted heat Pullman, and they are all very delicious. Freshly baked with a tasty texture. I usually get the honey spread, or almond butter & berry jam. It's both healthy & filling. Always satisfied.\n\n- The overall ambiance is cozy, space often occupied by working professionals. Sleek interiors, great lighting, aesthetic wood chairs outdoors. \n\n- The only downside is this place's seats are often filled. Even if there are empty seats, they are very close to one another. So space-wise it's not ideal. \n\n- It's about a 7-10 minute walk from the 24th mission bart. Pretty convenient location. Doesn't open very late.

While this creates a fantastic work environment, it's not the best venue for chatting or hanging out with friends. You're expected to be churning work -- which is why I can always trust a visit to Haus to fire up my productivity. \n\nThe coffee, tea, and pastries leave something to be desired. There are offerings of a variety of jams and butters on bread, but the price is steep for a slice of dry bread with some jam slapped onto one side. Maybe the price makes sense -- I'm sure price isn't a consideration and becomes relatively inelastic when the starved techie who's been zoned into code for 6 hours straight takes a breath from her laptop and stumbles towards the counter. \n\n\"Give me 5 breads please. Any jam.\" This is me at least once a week. I usually rationalize to myself that the $40 is well worth the hours of high-throughput productivity. \n\nTips:\n-- The Chai Latte is the only redeeming item on the menu.

It is so quiet that even whispers would get people to give you looks. I believe the baristas play music only because they can't stand the silence. The ambiance is light and organic. I can't help but walk around to the back patio to see how much of the cafe is made by the staff. Speaking of the back patio, it's even quieter than the inside since the music only drifts out the door.\n\nBesides the ambiance, the staff is really nice and the coffee is good.

After deciding on an iced coffee for me, and a limeade for my gf I tried to get the baristas attention. I noticed however that she was buttering some toast (or so it appeared) and gave her some time to finish what she was doing. When ordering she seemed unhappy to be there and like she would rather be elsewhere or maybe just left alone.   When she was preparing our drinks I whispered to her inquiring about why it was so quiet (a question I thought harmless) and she snapped back, rolling her eyes once more the way I would imagine a teenage girl would saying that people were working, which to her point seemed to be true. The iced coffee was a delight but the limeade was just some whole foods lime juice and selzter. So all in all I am not only extremely upset by the rude and snooty barista, but also the drinks.

For those of you who make cafes their niches like I do, they have several extension cords so your laptops won't be without juice even if you're here for more than a couple hours.\n\nInterior is really nice and clean. Simple space with minimal decor. Wooden features, artwork along the walls, and ample, natural lighting. They also have plenty of seats in their patio, which is just as nice as inside. Though, I'm not too sure how many outlets there are, if any, outside.\n\nI ordered their iced black tea, limeade, and bran muffin and all were pretty good! Black tea wasn't too strong, and the limeade wasn't too sweet--as with the bran muffin. Everything was just right. I have yet to try their coffee. But will definitely be back for it.", "author": "Kristine N."}

My first impression when I walked in was that I had inadvertently stumbled into a library; the place is packed but silent, save for the light music in the background. Perhaps this place has a different feel on weekends (it's midday on a Tuesday), but this is obviously the place to go if you work remotely and need coffee, but also concentration. The young woman behind the counter is very pleasant, however I appear to have come too late in the day to get anything besides cookies. \nDespite the lack of sustenance, the coffee here is great.

My friend spent $820 to fix her damaged computer and even provided a copy of the invoice that clearly stated the reason for the damage was due to liquid spillage. \n\nIt has now been several months with zero follow up or follow through from this establishment. While the coffee and pastries may be decent, I am a firm believer of voting with your dollars and Haus does not respect its customers or value their business. I will not be patronizing this establishment any longer.", "author": "John V."}

With that in mind, I really enjoyed Haus's coffee, however, they gained a 5-star review from me for a plethora of other reasons. While I am no coffee expert I am paticular about which coffee establishments I visit since I spend hours there studying.\n1.Price/Selection 4/5:I love my coffee but I am not going to spend $10 to get my daily fix. Haus offers fair prices for an array of coffee, however, their lack of snacks/food is why it only gets 4/5 since it is lacking. \n2.Music/Noise Lvl 5/5: I have visited this coffee shop multiple times and usually it is not jammed pack and ridiculously noisy by customers. You cannot control the people around you, however, you can control the background music, machinery used, employees, etc and they do a perfect 5/5 job. My only recommendation would be to turn down the music volume by one level. \n3.Stud-a-bility(env which one can study) 5/5: With many tables, power strips, and couches, this is by far one of my favourite study places in SF. I have a favorite table, which I wont disclose, but all the spots are within feet of a plug. This has solidified me as a repeat customer\n4.Bathroom 4/5: Face it, SF has thee worst bathroom situation. Most of them are freakishly small, smell, dirty, and I can go on and on. Haus bathroom is kept clean, almost always smell free, decent in size, and while I wouldnt say its the place to pee (it is a public bathroom after all) it does an above average job. \n5.Decor/Env 5/5:While my nose in generally stuck in my books/laptop I do raise my head occasionally and look around. They clearly planned out how they would design their coffee shop and they did a bag up job.

What in the name of all things good and decent is going on with this music! I'm sitting here--right now--in the comfy couch by the window in the back. I want to stab myself in the ears so I don't have to hear any more of this. My MP3 player is at max. The earbuds are as deep in my ears as physically possible without minor surgery.\n\nThe first few minutes you played great ambiance music at respectable volumes so I ordered, cuddled up with a friendly looking chair, and started working.

No, they don't.\n\nAt this point I don't remember if I liked your coffee. What did I get? It was decaf...I seem to remember some odd stipulation about what you can make decaf. Oh, also there was ice in it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-20", "description": "My review of this cafe is in no way directed at the people who work there or the service but rather the crowd of people who attend here.  Service is great, friendly and the pastries and cappuccinos very good.  Seating arrangement great and design of cafe very interesting.\n\nHowever, the people who go to this cafe are rather distant and even more so than a typical Starbucks location.  I'm actually not comparing Haus Cafe to a Starbucks because that wouldn't be fair but the point is, at a Starbucks, you usually meet the same kinds of people but can still get a conversation going or at least talk to people.\n\nWith Haus Cafe, it seems everyone is in their own group and they're techaholics (as in the typical techies who are more interested in their tech work than mingling).  One customer was about to sit down next to me and I had my notebook computer bag next to his seat and the tone of his voice, when he asked me to move his bag, seemed to be an anti-social, robotic tone.  First off, I didn't know my bag was in his way but regardless, the customer didn't even say \"thank you.\"\n\nThe odd part of the Haus Cafe is that it's located at Folsom St. near 24th & Mission so well within the Mission District but also around a lot of Mexican restaurants & communities and other mom 'n' pop shops, bakeries, etc.  This cafe though is out of place in the Mission and belongs more in Downtown SF or nearby in SOMA.  Maybe Haus Cafe is emblematic of why a number of long-time residents of the Mission are getting sick and tired of how the tech industry is invading their communities and affecting culture adversely.", "author": "M B."}

It's all sorta the same to me. I, personally, look for amenities when I go to coffee shops. That's because I only go to coffee shops when I'm looking for a place to get work done.\n\nSo now that that's understood, I have to say I really really really like Haus. It's clean. Both in the sanitary sense and in the design sense. Upkeep wise, the place is never dusty or dirty, and the bathroom is almost always spotless. As for design, it's very minimalist. Bright, unadorned white walls, and impeccable, slick wood furniture make up the guts of the place. But the very high industrial wood ceiling and fantastic lighting scheme mixed with an all window storefront are what really give it the bright, crisp, and modern feel. Add chill music, super fast reliable wi-fi, nice-enough baristas and a backyard area, and you've got yourself a great coffee shop for all day work/chill sessions. Oh, and did I mention the coffee is strong as hell?\n\nThe only drawback? Closes at 9pm.\n\nPrices: 2 bucks for a small, 2.50 for a large coffee.\n\nThat's fair as I'm concerned.\n\nOverall, Haus is legit.", "author": "Gil M."}

We entered Haus and I immediately thought we had stumbled into an Apple commercial or silent flash mob of Mac book using ultra hipsters and I was horrified.  \"Oh God NOOOO!\" I thought to myself and then I turned and saw the unbelievably lame ironic WiFi password posted on the register: \"Surreptitious\" and just knew I had entered the holy hipster hell of the mother scratching planet!  I was sure at that moment that I was being watched and if I made one wrong move, a gang of skinny, shabbily dressed, pre-pubescent beard wearing, Radio Head loving (only on Vynil and not the song Creep) freaks were going to tie me up with their iPhone headsets and launch me out into the street in front of a Muni bus!  However, since i was with a friend and we were in his neighborhood and he's never steered me wrong with his recommendations for places for me to take people in the city, I took a couple of deep breaths and decided to just go with the flow.\n\nOnce my cultural panic attack subsided, I realized something was missing from Haus...the loud and awful music blasting one hears at places like Starbucks.  I also noticed the lack of people marching up to the counter and barking out something along the lines of \"Frappe mocca cappuchini delux with four pumps and almond soy frazzledoonie!\" like a militarized robot.  It was actually quite refreshing and I was starting to dig this joint.  Don't get me wrong, I still had my head on a swivel, constantly on the watch for a surprise hipster attack but I was starting to feel very at ease, almost calm and comfortable.  I was becoming one with Haus Coffee.\n\nWe got to the counter and were greeted by the girl working there who, let's just be honest, was very pleasant to behold, who took our orders (double espresso for me and a macchiato for him).  Side note here, my friend, who may or may not be Irish, laughed and called me the C word right in front of the pretty girl when I asked him what the hell a macchiato is.  (No really, what is it?).  Then we sat at a table near the outdoor patio.\n\nHere's where it gets good, we sat down, it was quiet, and out of nowhere, some guy walks up and asks us if we mind if he sits at the table next to us (had an outlet on the wall).  I was shocked.  Imagine in today's world, some person actually considering that another person may not want them to sit right next to them when there are other tables open and having the courtesy to ask if it's ok?  Did I stumble into some strange vortex where people are actually polite?\n\nOur drinks came out and instead of being in some cardboard cup that smells like a shoebox with a sleeve, they were in these strange containers I remember from olden times called 'cups'.  I had to look at my cup for a minute and try to remember what the purpose of the hoop shaped thing sticking out of the side was....oh yes, it is to hold the cup like a civilized person so you can enjoy your beverage.  Sweet mother of crap I love this place!!!\n\nI don't even remember what the espresso tasted like.  For all I know, the lady behind the counter could have emptied an ash tray into a cup of hot water, stirred it up and served it to me.  What stood out the most about Haus was that:\n1.  It wasn't a pain in the ass\n2.  It wasn't filled with annoying dipshits\n3.  Music was not loud\n4.  People were not loud\n5.  Everyone, including the customers were polite\n6.  My drink was served in an actual drinking vessel\n\nPlace is so awesome, I might just go out, buy some skinny jeans, not shave for two weeks, and go hang out there all day long and surf the web!

And a little cup-top drip thinger. \n\nYep.\n\nSooooo, when this occasionally happens, and I am at home, and it is the morning time, I have to run out and buy some. We all know that the demise of  Mission IGA left some sort of crackhead-at-3AM shaped hole in our community, but it also sold a small selection of coffee beans. And so, in a pinch, I have once before run out to Haus to purchase some Ritual espresso beans.\n\nThe first time this occurred, the lady happily sold me a half pound and sent me on my merry (albeit slightly headachey, but merry nevertheless) way. I used them and then went out and bought my regular coffee and all was well in the land.\n\nHaving travelled much this past month, I found one lovely rainy morn that my grinder was without beans. My word! I pulled on my rain slicker and trudged out into the weather to the closest cafe to me that does not have a queue down the block (...insert a ponderous sound here...) to purchase a half pound of Ritual espresso beans. I would have even bought a full pound if it would have made someones life more convenient. I mean, I'm easy like a Sunday morning, I just need a damn coffee in the morning, especially on a Sunday. (This wasn't on a Sunday, but it's true.)\n\nHaus is literally one minute from my house. This becomes important in this story very soon.\n\nSo I am standing there, and the lady asks me for my order and I ask about buying some beans. \n\nBlank stare. Sigh. \"Wouldn't you rather just go to Ritual?\"\n\nBlank stare again, but this time it was on my face. \"Well, I'm....ummm....well....\"\n\nI could go on with this story, but it was mumbly, and ended in me leaving, not exactly angrily. The feeling I had was more of a gentle bemusement, with a slight caffeine headache on the side. The anger came a few moments later, outside, when I had to find another way to get coffee. Have you ever attempted that without having first had a coffee?\n\nIf picking up the phone to find out how much coffee by the pound costs is too much of a bother, perhaps working in cafe is not the way to go about things.\n\nThe End.\n\nPS I have never liked this place, but I bear it no ill will. \n\nPPS Put some art on the walls.

It's almost amazing, but it's falling short in two main areas. They need to be said.\n\nPros: \n- Beautiful minimalist vibe. Great place to actually get work done.\n- Usually good music.\n- Lovely back patio.\n- Cool crowd that works here.\n- Coffee and coffee drinks are great. \n- Kombucha offered -- yes!\n- Yerba Matte offered -- yes!!\n\nCons:\n- GRUMPY BARISTA. Ugh. Ok. Seriously, what is the deal with the woman barista? She is always so damn unfriendly, and pretty uncomfortable to deal with. I honestly sometimes don't want to come in here because I feel a knot in my stomach having to talk to her when she is working, so I just go to Philz. \n\nI was at first offended by her extreme attitude toward me and how rude she was when I was simply ordering a coffee, smiling at her, being a normal customer, but chalked it up to her having a bad day. The next time I came in she was also rude and I thought, OK, this chick just really doesn't like me for some reason. Must be the way I look because she doesn't utter a word to me or ever return a smile or conversation, won't make eye contact with me on purpose (which is pretty damn rude when you are a cashier), yet obviously doesn't know me at all. (I mean, I don't look unusual or offensive, so nothing really makes sense here). The next time I came in I decided to try to engage her in conversation and kill her with kindness, trying to win her over. Uhh, no. That did not work. Super grump, no eye contact, purposefully being rude like she wanted me to know she didn't like me or that she was above me or something. Now it's just annoying. I\"m not sure if she's one of the owners or just a barista, but I urge Haus to talk to her about her behavior to customers. Nobody wants to be in an uncomfortably unfriendly environment while they are trying to be simple paying customers. It quite frankly, sucks.\n\n- Haus would REALLY benefit from adding some additional food options other than just pastries. I know some people like sweet pastries, and that's great... But when you are sitting there working for a long time, ordering more coffee or tea throughout the morning or day, sometimes you get hungry for something savory. Philz offers a ton of items, from savory philo dough bites to small breakfast burritos, to bagels with hummus.  I'm not sure what Haus has the capacity to heat up or make, but even anything savory at all would be nice, as not all of us can eat those sweets. I have on many occasions, left Haus and went over to Philz to continue working there, only because I got hungry and they had food. I can see Haus offering something like empanadas from the local Venga Empanada Bakery...  (That's what Sugarlump offers and it's great!)", "author": "Honey T."}

The volume was also good. One drawback is the hard- assed wood seats which are killer on the ole L4/ L5 when its acting up.

Laptops galore, but in that respect it is a pretty great find. Mostly the same coffee drinks you'll find at Ritual Roasters on Valencia, with maybe half the hipster vibe. Granted, you're still in the Mission, but the minimalist decor and its location make it less trafficked, although on a busy work day you might be hard-pressed to find a table to work on.\n\nMy friend thinks the chairs are uncomfortable, but I'm fine with them -- they keep my back mostly upright, and I get my work done. There are plenty of outlets to plug into, and both small and larger tables for individuals or groups. The music is typical Mission hipster -- I've heard Beatles, Brian Eno, Tom Waits, some shoegazing. It's stuff I'd probably be listening to at home if I weren't listening to NPR. The music can be a little loud sometimes, but the noise level in general is pretty amenable to working -- some low-key conversations, but mostly people conversing with their computers. Although my friend played chess with his buddies here just the other day.\n\nParking is pretty reasonable if you don't live in the neighborhood -- you can usually find a spot on Folsom or Harrison, one or two blocks away (barring street cleaning, meters, some hour-long time limits).

I definitely go a month without, and then go three times in one week. Regardless, I feel like I've been here enough times to have a really good say. \n\nPros: \n- It is a breath of fresh air on busy, loud, culturally-diverse 24th Street. At the right time, it can be downright soothing by comparison. \n- The management seems to have listened. The music still trends to the quiet electronic, but the volume is lower. Loud enough to be white noise when you don't have headphones, but easy to cover with your own music. \n- POWER OUTLETS. Bless them. I wish every coffeeshop in San Francisco had such an abundance of power outlets. \n- They don't give you attitude if you order one coffee and then stay for four hours. \n- The coffee is really good, I think. OK, it's no Four Barrel, though I think they use their beans. I even think Dynamo Doughnuts down the way does a killer latte. But it's darned good coffee, and none of those other places have wifi. \n- The tea is a great deal, especially when you consider The Summit on Valencia. I think it's $2.50, and they'll refill the water as many times as you want (though the tea really can only handle it once). \n- From an aesthetic standpoint, the interior is restful. Very Ikea-ish, mid-century modern. Well-lit. Lots of tables for laptops. \n\nCons: \n- Service is variable. The nice hipster dude seems to recognize me and does a great job. Consequently, he gets a tip. Some of the other baristas (just noticed that they're women) can cop an attitude. Yes, it's rude to carry on a conversation with a friend while a customer is waiting to order. If I go sit down while you make my coffee, that does not give you a license to make it 20 minutes later. \n- The chairs are hard as f***. Perhaps this is their don't-stay-forever tactic. But wait until one of the chairs or couch spots opens up, and problems solved. \n- Not enough outlets on the patio.\n- The baked goods are blah.\n\nBut still, Haus is my solid go-to coffee shop in the MIssion.", "author": "Tom P."}

It's not Starbucks, in other words, with the Norah Jones oeuvre on a loop (and they're for sale at the register where you purchase your sugar-free creme de menthe skinny frap!)\n\nBut there's a limit. Metal, Krautrock and experimental electronic music are off-putting to most. If it were just me I'd hold my tongue. Your cafe should be for the baristas more than it should be for me as an individual.

Nobody wants to hurt anyone's feelings.\n\nSo this is just a friendly plea. From one customer.

Haus is becoming more successful and popular but ironically that is making the atmosphere inside absolutely impossible.   The lack of seating, the one barista on bar who cannot humanly keep up with the volume, and lots of people especially groups who sit around and don't order, it all adds up to a sad face experience.  While Haus still has the most brilliant sunlight, its just become too stressful a place to be whether that be work on the mac or chat with a friend.   I'll certainly try to patron it again, but only during off-hours or very early mornings as to avoid the afternoon techie startup groups.

But really, the two are a bit like apples and oranges, and Haus has stepped in to fill a void on 24th street that Philz cannot satisfy.  That void is the espresso drink void.\nHaus serves a full list of coffee drinks - espresso, cappuccino, latte, macchiato - as well as french press coffee made fresh every 20 minutes.  That french press is really what's up, it's so dense and flavorful you'll never want drip again.  The espresso is made by Ritual and the coffee beans are from De La Paz, both local companies.  The baristas here really care about the quality of the drink and really want the customer to be satisfied with every detail - be it the foam on your cappuccino or the volume level of the music.\nThey do charge extra for soy (50cents), and are experimenting with other non-dairy options such as almond milk.  The pastries are also made by young, new, mission district bakeries and the choices are more interesting than your typical banana bread and a bagel.  There's sea salt & lavender cookies, cheese scones, vegan apricot scones, vegan cookies and vegan breakfast bars.  \nThe space is uuuuber modern and raw, which you should have guessed given the name \"Haus.\"  I think a few more decorative objects might help - simply because the surfaces do little to absorb noise, making it very tinny and echo-y in there.  Perhaps some velvet paintings from TJ guys?? j/k.  There's also a large back patio with some tables, making it perfect on sunny days or for those of you who love a cigarette with your coffee.

I eye some couches in the back and figure I'll park myself there until one becomes available.\nI am barely acknowledged by the young staff member behind the counter  Ouch!  First minute = 1 star.\nI order a Cappuccino & a cookie (beware, eat somewhere else before coming here if planning on doing an afternoon's worth of work - there is only a very sparse selection of baked goods).  \nLucky for me, a table frees up just as I pay.  Perfect timing!\n\nCookie is yummy.  Cappuccino is good, not great. = 3 stars $5.00 pays for both.\n\nShucks!  Forgot my earphones.  Luckily, some VERY COOL ambient music comes on... I'm quickly warming up to this place and getting over my initial lack of being wowed by my drink. All patrons are here to work...  which for this afternoon, I appreciate.  There are no loud-volume talkers to have to filter out.\n\nNote: Not all tables have access to power outlets.  \nUnfortunately, I'm sitting at one of these. But luck is on my side again. With only 50 minutes battery power left, someone across the room departs and I snag up a table next to power source.  \nAt this time I order a Soy Chai. Boy behind counter smiles this time.  OK.  Maybe because it was so sunny out when i first walked in, he was not so happy to be working.  Now that is a little dark outside, his mood is brightening.  We'll bump customer service up to 3 stars now.\nAgain, the drink is sub-par... lacking that extra creamy something I expect my chai latte from a \"cool\" cafe to deliver.  At least it cost only $3.00 for the soy chai... a good $1-1.50 less than Starbucks would charge for the same!\n\nSo why 4 stars?\n\nDespite not being too impressed with the strength of the drinks (I'll try the straight up coffee next time), I LOVE the light airy environment with the light wood tables, great overhead lighting, and super clean environment. The staff DID warm up (i award progress!), nice mixed crowd of people focusing on their work -  no pretentious customers!  And fabulous background music!\n\nSo, I will definitely be back and will order straight up coffee next time.", "author": "Amber W."}

It's a nice and simple place - there's a patio in the back and the inside has a cute little couch and armchair setup amongst other surprisingly comfy tables.  Got the mocha - which I thought was pretty standard.  I'm mostly pleased with the environment; I could kill hours here.  But there's not much else around here and it's kind of a trek for me to venture out to this part of the mission.  If it were a bit more convenient, I'd definitely make it a regular chill spot.", "author": "Jessica W."}

The humble newcomer to artisan coffee in the Mission, Haus has only been open a month or so as of this writing.  There's a lot to discuss here, but let's start with the coffee.  Haus procures beans from two choice roasters, both within a few blocks of the cafe: De La Paz and Ritual Roasters.  For now, De La Paz is the bean of choice for their house coffee which is always french press and without a doubt the best french press I've had to date.  I can't even make it this good at home and I'm not sure what their secret is.  Espresso and espresso drinks are currently pulled with Ritual beans, and as you would expect, it's mighty fine.  I've only had espresso made by Ryan, one of the managers who is there in the mornings and have yet to try out the training of the rest of the staff.  Ryan certainly knows his stuff and is super friendly to boot.  Kudos to the management for offering customers a choice of local roasters.  I'd love to see what Jason and Co. over at De La Paz can put together for a Haus espresso blend.  \nUnless I'm mistaken, this will be the first cafe in the mission with outdoor seating in the back.  There's a large patio nestled between some houses and ivy-covered walls that's not yet ready for customers, but looks to be soon.  I'm impressed that they seem to be building much of their own seating by hand.\nFor now the atmosphere has not fully developed, but this translates to short lines and plenty of available seating at their big and small tables, and their fireside sofa.  Let's get some local art in here and we'll be set!", "author": "Carlisle H."}

I think they're going for modern, but the place almost looks unfinished interior design-wise. The menu is a bit limited too - probably 5 or 6 basic coffee drinks and some tea. So, yeah, this place definitely hits a minimalist vibe. I don't think they even have a sign out front. The coffee is good though, but get decaf if you don't want a caffeine headache for 2 days. That's strong stuff... or maybe it's just me. It was pretty quiet on a Thursday evening (like a lot of reviews have said, mostly single people on laptops), but that's good for quiet conversation... or laptop use. Service wasn't super friendly, but the guy got the coffee in the cup, so I can't be too critical. It's not a bad place, but I probably wouldn't go back.", "author": "Caitlin H."}

It's minimalist, functional, and no-nonsense but at the same time, very charming and warm. My friend and I both ordered teas, which actually woke me up. The little amount of caffeine in tea usually doesn't do much for me, but Haus tea did the trick! The one thing I really loved was that the cafe was super spacious and the tables were large, meaning there's room to spread out papers and books and laptops. Plus there were an abundance of outlets. Also, there's great big windows that capture all the sunlight, making this a very bright and great place to sit for a while.

To provide a kind of shelter for such undercover pests to society there exist, naturally, copious amounts of coffee shops designed to house pseudodestitute freeloaders as efficiently as possible, and then attempt to make a profit from the slow trickle of purchases under $5 that they provide. In exchange for this meager but reliable natural resource, it is custom to provide amenities such as wireless in order for us creatures to perform strenuous labor while reposing in front of various computing devices. As many of the other reviews for Haus indicate, this space is in the upper tier of establishments of its kind. Pleasing Scandinavian decor, good coffee (I favor the $2 iced americano myself), comfortably designed space to actually sometimes do useful work in, a nice outdoor patio, a good density of clientele.
