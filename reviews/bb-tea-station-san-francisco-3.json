I tried the BB iced milk with boba and pudding and it was delish! If you like things sweeter you have the option of adding caramel. I was wondering if I should get it half sweet like I normally do but the employee told us the iced milk wasn't that sweet by itself and he was right. They recommend you mix up the drink when you first get it. Make sure to get a little bit of everything in a sip to get the perfect mouthful. The velvety pudding and chewy sweet boba paired well with the more neutral iced milk. The employee offered to remake our drink if we thought it was too sweet but it ended up being perfect.\n\nThere's a few seats inside and some games available to use and play.

It seems to have become a popular hangout spot for students to hang out after school and do homework in. \n\nWe ordered a couple drinks. The yogurt drink is probably one of the most bizarre boba drinks I've had. I thought it would have more of a tea consistency, similar to the ones at other places. Instead, I felt as though I had stuck a straw through my carton of breakfast yogurt. To be fair, they did have a handwritten note under this menu item saying, \"NOT YAKULT.\" \n\nThe iced milk drink was good, similar to that of Purple Kow or Bubblecup. You can customize sweetness/ice levels, and the milk drink definitely would've tasted better if it had been less sweet. \n\nService-wise...meh. There was only one employee working, so it was slow and we waited for over 15 minutes. The group that came in after us got all four of their drinks before we did, which was annoying. \n\nAll in all, not a bad spot for your boba-fix if you're nearby, but otherwise, head elsewhere.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

It has been a little over two years since our first visit and we were more than ready to determine if this place was the real boba deal.\n\nParking around the area isn't too tough, considering it is San Francisco, but do keep in mind that all parking is metered so don't forget to bring your coins. The parlor itself is roomy enough with some seating for a hang out and the menu is nicely placed on a wall beside the cashier, making for easy reading. I personally like how they have a poster of their top ten drinks and then a color coded chart where you can choose your milk tea, iced drink, fruit tea, and smoothie. Definitely take your time to look at that!\n\nThe hubby wanted to get the honeydew milk tea with grass jelly while I chose one of their popular drinks, the iced milk with grass jelly and boba. The cashier was a very friendly guy who was more than eager to help and provided great service. Prices are incredibly inexpensive, totaling a little under $7 for the both of us. I will have to admit that I do hate the \"cash only\" policy.\n\nMy hubby greatly enjoyed the honeydew milk tea, noting how fresh and smooth it tastes. The fruit flavor blended well with the green tea and the silkiness of the grass jelly added a nice refreshing component. My iced milk was blended together and while it was perfect to have on a hot day, I do wish it was a tad bit sweeter. Thankfully, the boba itself was coated with a delectable honey syrup, so my sweet tooth wasn't too disappointed.\n\nEven after two years, the hubby and I are still happy with BB Tea Station. Perhaps this visit wasn't as perfect as the first one, but good enough that we plan to come back again. \n\nCome for the cute cows, stay for the drinks!", "author": "Quyen L."}

In this part of town, TFM closes a tad too early, and Super Cue doesn't really have any comfortable seating, so BB Tea fills this void. The decor is a bit strange, although according to some previous reviews, apparently there initially was more elaborate theming. I wonder what caused the change.\n\nOf the times I have visited, it has never been busy. As a matter of fact, on a recent Saturday evening in August, many of the latenight establishments along Noriega, including Golden Island a few doors down, were packed to the rafters, but the staff at BB Tea was more busy swatting flies (a Chinese phrase to indicate a lack of business). I was pretty much the only customer in the entire store from 10 pm to midnight. However, if they can manage to stay afloat, this certainly works for me!\n\nAs far as the drinks go, I'd say it is in the middle of the pack for SF. It's not quite at Little Sweet status, but is more favorable to a place like Teaspoon. I surely wouldn't drop by BB Tea just for their offerings, but as mentioned, it makes for a great study spot.\n\nOne oddity is that the high chairs seem a bit too tall for the small tables, to the point where even a manlet like me is forced to hunch over slightly.

Probably cause I haven't heard any hype about it. I've often passed by BB at night, and it always seemed quieter and less busy compared to other boba places. I guess you could say I'd been opting for my go-to boba places, instead of giving BB a try. It was actually my friend who suggested we try it after we had lunch.\n\nI decided to order the BB iced milk with green tea, no boba. I was pleasantly surprised! It tasted refreshing, good mix of both milk and green tea, not too heavy and not too sweet either. This was my first time ordering an iced milk drink though, so I have nothing to compare it to. I also appreciated that the guy who made my drink advised me to mix my drink well since the tea is at the bottom. :)\n\nLike others have mentioned, the menu is confusing! I found myself staring at the menu for a few minutes, trying to figure out how to read it. I love color, and I liked the colors they used for each item on the menu, but the dots just made the menu too busy and confusing. \n\nThe place itself is simply furnished, but painted with vibrant colors, which gave me a cheerful vibe. I noticed some games in the back, which is nice of them to provide, but I wondered briefly if they had gotten the idea from Craftea lol. I dunno, there's just something about BB that doesn't seem as inviting as other boba places. Perhaps it's the overall presentation? I noticed that they merely put a sticker with their logo onto the cup. I liked the iced milk a lot, but I think I'd still opt for my usual go-to boba places to get my boba fix.

After we ordered, we sat down at one of the tables and I realized there was a couch and a table with games on a shelf further inside the store. We decided to play Jenga while waiting for our drinks and it was  ready within 10 minutes. When I went up to grab my boba ice milk tea, the owner said \"stir it well because all the flavor is at the bottom!\" and smiled.\nOverall, I would recommend this place to my friends and family. This place is by far the best boba place around with a cheap price and no wait/lines. They have great customer service and the place is cute!", "author": "Vicky L."}

I have to admit that I'm not the biggest milk tea or boba lover, but that's why BB Tea Station shines. They offer different drinks, like icy milks & yogurt drinks. I'm a dedicated \"icy milk\" fan & almost always get the G5 (pudding, caramel, & boba), but leave out the boba. It's the perfect balance of not-so-sweet for me. The yogurt drinks are also really great because they're actually tart & there are a million different flavors.", "author": "Ruby H."}

Where's the tea taste?  This tasted like a sweet almond drink rather than a flavored milk tea.  It was \"perfect\" after I went home and added brewed tea to it.\n\nSo on my second visit, I went with a plain black milk tea, less sweet, but this was also too sweet even without any add-ins.  It tasted like sweet milk with barely any tea taste and was ok only after I went home and added brewed tea to it.  I shouldn't have to go home and tweak a milk tea from a tea place.\n\nI decided to give this place one last chance so that I can try their iced milk drink.  On my third and final not-so-charmed visit, which was also my friend's birthday weekend, we asked the cashier if they would honor the free birthday drink (as advertised on their facebook page) even though it was the day before her actual birthday.  The cashier asked the manager in charge, and the answer was \"no\".  So we decided to go support a different tea place that day.  We were new repeat paying customers...but not anymore since the drinks aren't good enough to make up for that experience.\n\nSorry, BB Tea Station.

Now, I think the menu should say there is milk in most of the drinks and maybe have an alternative for those that can't handle milk.\n\nI got my drink and it was larger than regular size which I didn't mind. I had a sip and it tasted like green tea, but a little off. I tasted the popping boba and I think it's something that's like a skin around it and then there's liquid in the middle. Like some sort of candy but a soft shell.\n\nOverall, my impression of the place was that they needed to have more inventory instead of running out. Have the cashiers tell you that the receipt has the number of your order. The cashiers should also note that if you do want a \"topping\" that it'll be $0.50 extra.

They don't have a huge variety compared to Tapioca Express and Quicklys, but a good amount to satisfy anyone's taste buds (hopefully). I also tried their chicken here, which isn't that great.. came with six chicken wings and it took awhile, maybe a good 10 minutes. It was okay, nothing special; I had better chicken wings.\n\nAll in all, drinks are good, food, not so great. Also, cash only!", "author": "Diana T."}

Honestly, it was the absolute worst drink I ever drank. I ordered the plum green tea and it was literally bitter green tea with two pieces of dried plums at the bottom. I couldn't even finish it, I took two sips and had to toss it out. I'm not even trying to sound like a food snob, but seriously this was probably the worst drink ever! My sister ordered the regular bubble milk tea with boba expecting nothing special in particular. However, we were both bombarded with a mouthful of sugary sweet milky drink. There was no tea flavor at all! I mean I thought it was suppose to be milk TEA, there was no tea in there at all. The other drink we ordered was a taro milk tea and it wasn't the typical purple color, which was surprising. This was the better of the drinks, but it had no taro flavor and tasted like a watered down regular milk tea. The one star I'm giving is specifically for the decor and unique/confusing menu. For goodness sake, even the Jenga sets were all messed up and the pieces were all different sizes.", "author": "Celina C."}
