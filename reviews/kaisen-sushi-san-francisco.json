Our server was so nice and attentive. Restroom is in the hotel next door.\n\nBetween my friend and I we got the:\n1) Beach Crunch Roll: Fairly standard roll w/ escolar, salmon, cilantro, jalapeno. The \"crunch\" part was the tempura bits which I didn't find all that necessary. The ingredients semi worked together though it really needed a sauce or something else to tie it together. There was a cool sriracha dragon on the side that looked gorgeous though didn't go all that well w/ the roll for me.\n\n2) 7 Piece Nigiri combo w/ hamachi roll: For $23 I'm pretty happy. Portions were generous and the fish was thick but not so much where it felt like I was just biting a straight fish off the line. There was also a decent variety that isn't just salmon & tuna. Garnishes were simple ranging from green onion to yuzu kosho to ginger. Fish all had some flavor and rice was average. Slightly seasoned and texture was it was a bit on the tougher side but still stuck together without being too compact. For my 7 pieces I believe I got yellowfin, suzuki (or tai?), salmon, seared escolar, albacore, hamachi toro?, & seared mackerel?\n\nOverall, while I can't say this is great sushi spot that I would go out of my way for. It's convenient, cheap, has variety, and wonderful service. If I'm ever working nearby I'd consider coming back again.", "author": "Vivian C."}

The closest was Kaisen Sushi, so we decided to give them a try! \n\nFrom the outside they don't look like anything special, but we stepped inside and they had almost every table packed... So we figured they had to be good! \n\nOne of the first things I noticed was that for checking in on Yelp, you get a free sake shot or matcha ice cream... We checked in, and my boyfriend got a free (hot) sake shot. Yum! \n\nWe sat at the sushi bar and the waitress was really busy running around tending to other tables and running between the kitchen and the dining area. I've been to several sushi joints where you can order at the bar, so I asked the chef if that was possible, and he pointed to the waitress and s said, \"Uhh, just a minute.\"\n\nWe ended up waiting like ten more minutes until our order was finally taken... I could tell she was definitely busy, I just wish there had been better communication or more staff in general so we weren't left feeling confused and forgotten.\n\nWe ordered quite the spread - miso soup, gyoza, two Crunchy Spicy California Rolls, a Caterpillar Roll, and a Volcano Roll. \n\nThe miso soup was really yummy. Just the right amount of salt and the tofu chunks weren't too big. I really liked it! Our gyoza were tasty too - crunchy and full of flavor. They were on HH as well, which is always a bonus. $5 for a plate of 6.\n\nThe sushi was delicious and presented SO BEAUTIFULLY. We each got our orders on wooden platters with different art in the middle of it. I got a peacock and my boyfriend got an octopus. It was so cute! \n\nThe Caterpillar Roll was a shrimp tempura roll and it was good. There was something sweet in it that wasn't my favorite but it didn't ruin it for me.\n\nThe Spicy Crunchy California Roll is NOOO JOKEEE. It was so good, but god DAMN it was spicy. This isn't just me saying that because I'm white, either. This thing was packing REAL HEAT. I've had so many \"spicy\" california rolls that can't even come close to touching this roll. It was sooo good, but it'll get your nose running for sure.\n\nI'm in this area of SF for work once or twice a year, so I'm definitely looking forward to coming back when I'm notttt pregnant and can explore more of the menu.", "author": "Lauren P."}

I would hesitate to recommend ordering sushi a la carte here. The sushi set dinners seem like the better option if your heart is set on nigiri.\n\nPrice-wise it's not too bad.

The place is pretty small and I have walked by and seen the place full so it was nice to get in right away. We got a few things off the happy hour menu: seaweed salad, veggie gyoza and takoyaki balls. Seaweed salad was the typical, always delicious seaweed salad you get everywhere. Gyoza was nice a crunchy but the takoyaki balls were, dare I say, kind of gross. They weren't crispy like you'd expect from a fried item. They came out looking pretty but they were rubbery all throughout, octopus especially! So that was a bummer.\n\nOther than that, everything else was good.

Came in and got seated at the bar area, I ordered Miso soup, Baked salmon roll, and Takoyaki. The soup was pretty good and the Takoyaki was alright. like some other reviewers mentioned it was kind of rubbery so I will give it an average. I was expecting a baked salmon roll where it is warm, as I took a bite of my salmon roll it was ice cold inside as if it was pre-made and sitting in the fridge and only the very thin outer layer was warm. Even worse, The salmon itself wasn't even completely warm and as I lift up the salmon I see the salmon was grey... I understand its the salmon itself but I didn't expect that to be the whole salmon! In addition, there were flies everywhere! I did not feel like the food I was eating was very clean as theres flies flying everywhere probably on top of sushi ingredients.", "author": "Nina Y."}

At first glance, it's small, a little cramped, with EDM playing in the background, and sports+action movies playing on the tv's. Not to mention the blaring LED lights decorating the storefront. But we were seated quickly, had drinks, and ordered food in the perfect amount of time. The food was served much faster than I would've expected. Generally, the quality of service on this beautiful Friday night was much higher than most other bars and restaurants, which were too packed and full of unruly people. Though it initially looked cramped, after we were seated, there was a good sense of intimacy. And, above all, when the food arrived, it tasted amazing! Everything tasted fresh and flavorful. And thanks to the good prices here, the quantity of food was perfect. For around $50 for 2 people, you'll leave full and satisfied (though you can easily pay half that price for 2 people).\n\nWho this location is good for:\n- Small groups of 1-6 people\n- Anyone looking for delicious sushi at a good price\n\nWho this location isn't good for:\n- Large groups\n- Anyone looking for a really fancy/classy atmosphere\n\nI can easily say I'll be returning to this location (maybe even today).

I stopped by on my way back from TJ lugging like 30lb of groceries. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the miso soup was $2 and that price of this staple, at least, was not inflated in San Francisco. I placed my takeout order and got the veggie gyoza, a crunchy spicy tuna w/ no avocado, a volcano roll, and a miso soup - I was ordering while hungry! I thought the food took longer to arrive than I expected but I figured it was probably because the gyoza actually has to be cooked but there were also quite a few people dining in. In any case, I was happy to be able to put my stuff down when the server told me I could have a seat at the bar to wait.\n\nOnce I got home, I was ready to dig in but I wanted to put all my stuff away and settle in so I didn't end up eating it til 20 minutes or so later. Once I finally did get to the food, I was (hilariously) taken aback by how small the miso soup portion was - it was like a 2 or 3oz container as opposed to the 6oz containers I'm used to on the east coast. San Francisco prices win again! The gyoza was alright - I enjoyed that there was bit of crunch to the dough but the filling itself wasn't particularly flavorful and the accompanying sauce was soooo salty. It's like they just added scallions and salt to soy sauce. The crunchy spicy tuna roll was pretty good and the volcano roll had potential but the spicy tuna topping was rather bland.\n\nWhile this place was not outstanding I would give it another chance with different rolls and I'd also try dining in.", "author": "Leslie C."}

The doors were open and there was only a fan to try to keep patrons from sweating.  Got fooled by the other Yelp reviews and the pictures.\n\nOrdered edamame, fried dumplings, spicy tuna roll, and salmon skin roll.\n\nMy critique of the food:\n\nProblem #1 - the edamame was not completely or evenly cooked.  Parts of the edamame were cold while other parts in the serving bowl was warm.  Never experienced this before in any sushi restaurant.\n\nProblem #2 - The fried dumplings had edamame mixed in with the inside ingredients.  I guess this is a fusion thing.  Did not like this.\n\nProblem #3 - The sushi rice was too soggy and I couldn't tell if there was any sushi vinegar in the rice.  \n\nProblem #4 - The spicy mayo sauce that was used to make spicy tuna  was not seasoned right.  And the tuna pieces were too chunky.\n\nProblem #5 - The Salmon skin in the roll was over fried to an ultra dried crisp and mixed with Bonito type flakes.\n\nWhen my wife expressed her dissatisfaction to the waiter, he had nothing to say.  We paid our bill and left.  \n\nAs we walked out, we noticed that there was a tall bowl of water with ice in front of the fan.

Prices are very fair for its central location, and they were very generous with the meat. Tasted amazing! We ordered ahead and picked up our order to go.

The staff here are extremely friendly, and though their fish isn't A++ quality, it's still very fresh & worth what you're paying for. Make sure you ask for Audy!

Although we were not given a choice of sitting at a table or the bar, we didn't mind. The wait staff and sushi chefs were very friendly and helpful. They would occasionally check on us to see if we enjoyed our food. We ordered a Cherry Blossom roll and a Salmon Lover's roll. Both came out quickly, and were decorated with various sauces arranged into a mini art piece. The sushi chefs told us that the sauce art was edible, and the waiter explained to us what each sauce was. The sauces included unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and wasabi mayo(?). We ate the sushi with and without the sauce, and it was delicious! Definitely would come back again!", "author": "Brandon N."}

Good price and very nice stuff. 7 tables and about 10 seats near the bar make it great place for romantic dinner but not for hanging with large group of friends.

The miso soup had good flavor and the salad tasted fresh. Those are the good points, now for the bad. The service was terrible to say the least. There were only 4 people in there but we must have been invisible. We are not Asian so the waitress did not seem interested in us. We had to ask for our soup and salad and they eventually came but not until we had our main course. I will not return, even with the free shot of saki.", "author": "Tracy G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-17", "description": "We chose to eat here to see the artworks with our own eyes and we were not disappointed.  We ordered the cherry blossom roll, the b&w roll, the baked scallop roll, the rainbow roll, and tonkatsu.  Out of all those ordered, my favorite was the baked scallop roll.  Although it took 15 minutes to arrive, it was worth the wait.  It came piping hot and wrapped with aluminum foil.  The roll is topped with baked cheesy mayonnaise with a thick layer of scallop underneath.  Do give this roll a try.  One thing to note is that escolar is on the menu.  Upon a quick search, escolar is also known as \"ex-lax fish\", any amount more than 6oz will cause explosive gastrointestinal issues.  Therefore, eat with caution.  All-in-all, this Vietnamese-operated establishment provides good quality food.  Service was also good albeit few minor mistakes that were amended quickly.", "author": "J H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-21", "description": "How does this place have 4.5 stars on yelp? This is a 1-2 star place for sure. The people who are saying this is the best sushi in the neighborhood or the city maybe have only eaten Safeway supermarket sushi...in Oklahoma? Or really love colored mayonnaise art to dip their sushi into? I lived in Japan for a few years, so I maybe have higher standards than others, but this is basically a Union Square spot for tourists or daytrippers/shoppers from the suburbs. The prices are not cheap at all and the fish is of the quality that you start getting a little disturbed on the second and third bites. Disturbed like, why is this fish so soft and falling apart? how long have they had the fish? Is it even sashimi-grade fish? I ordered a chirashi-sushi (slices of sashimi on top of rice) for $23 dollars. It came with about 7-8 THIN slices of fish and FOUR of those were COOKED FISH. I have never seen cooked fish served for chirashi-sushi and certainly not nearly 1/2 the fish in the dish being cooked. That just screamed CHEAP to me and that they kept sashimi fish so long that they decided they had to cook it in order for it to be safe to serve. It was also clear to me from the way that the fish and the tsukemono (pickles) were sliced and the sushi roll rice was prepared that the sushi chefs had not trained for their jobs. The slicing and the presentation were random and haphazard. The sushi roll rice was over compacted and gummy (almost like the machine-rolled costco sushi rolls). What the chefs have been trained in is making elaborate dragons out of colored mayonnaise. So this is the kind of sushi place to go to if you are into colored mayonnaise art. The other thing that really bothered me was the seating and the overall ambiance. The seats were rock-hard stools with no backs, there was random tacky blue light emanating from under the bar, bright fluorescent lights from above, super loud music AND the fast and the furious playing, the walls were scuffed concrete painted in different shades of industrial putty/beige, the doors were wide open to entice tourists to come it. It just wasn't a pleasant restaurant experience, food aside. We deeply regretted not having gone to our regular spot in the same neighborhood, Sanraku, which is in the Metreon. That is a Japanese-run place with high standards, pleasant atmosphere, and I would say prices on par or cheaper than Kaisen. There's really no reason to eat at Kaisen unless you are a desperate tourist who does not have a smartphone.", "author": "Cat M."}
