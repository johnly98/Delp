Omg, it was so tasty and satisfying, not to mention the portion was huge! I got mine with chorizo and upgraded to the super burrito for $1. You also have the option to add hash browns inside the burrito, which were crunchy and crispy and added a nice texture. \n\nThe salsa bar has a huge variety of options and they are all great supplements to the burritos (I loved the mango salsa!). They're also clearly labeled with spiciness level in case you're looking for something specific. \n\nThe location is convenient (right by 16th St. BART), prices are reasonable for the quality and enormous portion sizes.

I tried their chicken super burrito and carne asada fries.\n\nFirst, the burrito. It was $10.50 ($9.50 for the regular size, but I recommend only paying $1 more to make it super, which comes with added guac, cheese, lettuce, and sour cream!). The price is a little high compared to over taquerias in the area, but the portion size is no joke. The super burrito is massive and lives up to its name. \n\nThe burrito was great -- it was well-portioned, fresh, and didn't feel too heavy. They didn't skimp on the on the guac and the meat was very tender. The juices from the meat and the melted cheese brought it all together very well. 4/5\n\nA lot of people have raved about the carne asada fries ($9) on Yelp, but I was underwhelmed... The fries themselves weren't anything special, and the carne asada was a bit overcooked and lacked any sort of kick. The dish's presentation was also pretty sloppy. But again, the portion size was generous. I recommend sharing this! 3/5\n\nLos Coyotes isn't as popular as some other Mission taquerias, so service was quick and there was plenty of seating inside. I'll be back, especially when I don't want to fight the crowds at Pancho Villa.", "author": "Jordan H."}

The Horchata here is great too. Plenty of sauces and add-ons next to the register. They had this meat and grilled onion medley that we put on some tortilla chips that were amazing!

Sadly, the pupusas were sitting behind a glass shelf, and didn't look fresh so I passed on those and instead opted for carne asada fries and a medium agua fresca.\n\nThe portion was huuuge for both the drink and the fries- the fries were \"glued\" together with the cheese, and the toppings piled on top.

Their complimentary chips were warm and kept crispy, and the pico de gallo was pretty fresh from the bar. We both shared the Carne Asada fries and Carnitas Quesadilla (which they automatically charged a super quesadilla...so be aware if you don't want to pay extra for the guac, etc. to mention getting the regular...). The Carnitas were very on point and the quesadilla was packed mad with cheese. Three pieces were more than enough with take-out to spare for two! The Carne Asada Fries were also pretty satisfying. They were packed high with cheese and bits of steak. I thought the fries themselves were pretty greasy, but it was still worth since it was what we basically expected. \n\nOverall, I would come back here....if I was particularly looking for Carne Asada fries.

I'm originally from San Ysidro ( the border city between USA and Mexico), so I'd like to say that I know my Mexican cuisine pretty well. I pretty much grew up on campechana fries and horchata. When my boyfriend decided to get Mexican for dinner, I asked him for a place with carne asada fries since it's not too common in the SF area. We walked down to the Mission of course, and I wasn't expecting too much, but I was so amazed by Coyotes! The ambiance inside is so spacious with lots of tvs, menus, and Mexican music blasting in the background. We ordered their carne asada fries and a carne asada burrito. \n\nI checked out their salsa bar and it was the best salsa bar I've ever seen. Not only was it the typical salsa verde and rojo, they also had fresh mango salsa along with chorizo and onions. I actually saw them making the chorizo but I thought it was for an order and not for the salsa bar! Their chips were also delicious, kind of a blend with wheat because it was more starchy but flavorful. When the carne asada fries came out, I thought the plate was reasonably sized, but I couldn't finish it even with my boyfriend's help! The best part about the carne asada fries were the freshly melted cheese, generous amount of guacamole, sour cream, frijoles, carne asada, and the fries were the crispy skinny fries. Just altogether delicioso!! The burrito was also delicious with the soft tortilla and the salsa inside. I am already salivating thinking about Coyotes, until next time!", "author": "Ada C."}

Quick to clean so there's no issues here.\n\nFood:\nAfter you order your food there's a serving station that further allows customization, very useful if you are disappointed when restaurants forget that key ingredient. Food came out very quick for us. I think maybe less than 3 minutes.\n\nSteak quesadilla:\nThis was one of the lows of the restaurant. The meat was quite dry and tasted really unseasoned. There was guacamole and sour cream to further supplement, but I really wanted the meat to be the star of the show.\n\nGuacamole and chips:\nReally lackluster here. The chips were cold to the touch and the guacamole was really flat in flavor, I had to add a good amount of lime to get a sense of flavor. The size of the guacamole isn't too large if that's a concern.\n\nHorchata:\nAs a big horchata fan, this was close to being a great, but it was served seemingly close to lukewarm which made the rest of the drink a let down.", "author": "Vinh T."}

I started with one lengua and one carnitas taco and I was impressed. Fatty, flavorful, tender. The right mix of umami, salt, and tang (I personally like putting Verde on my tacos). Onions /celantro for a bit if freshness and crunch and solid tortilla. I was so impressed I went back for more trying the chorizo and al pastor. Chorizo was crispy and flavorful, with a hint of char. Al pastor also very good, fatty with a bit of sweetness. My personal favorite is the lengua, but you really can't go wrong with the tacos.\n\nThe line can get a bit long during busy hours, but probably less so then Pancho. It's your regular taco joint so don't expect anything fancy, and it's in the mission so don't expect perfect cleanliness either, though they bus their tables often enough to look tidy.

The place was pretty busy and all the tables were taken, but the ordering line went pretty fast and it didn't take long for tables to open up.  I wasn't in the mood for something typical like tacos or a burrito, and the first thing that actually caught my attention on the menu was their Pork Belly Guisado, and that's exactly what I ordered.  They so had me at Pork Belly.\n\nPork Belly Guisado -- http://bit.ly/1GTLtN0\nEssentially it's a roasted pork belly in a red sauce that comes with rice, beans, and tortillas.  Well, the dish was okay.  You definitely get a big portion of pork belly and the platter will fill you up, but man, was this dish overly salty!  And one piece of the pork belly had a tough exterior part that was hard to chew.  Despite the saltiness and the one tough piece, I still enjoyed the rest of it.\n\nI can't really give a high or low rating for Taqueria Los Coyotes just based on this one dish which was mediocre, so I'll give them 3 stars for now.  I'm betting that their usual staples such as their burritos and tacos are probably really good.  I'm willing to come back again to try them out but the only problem is with them being in the Mission and a whole slew of Taquerias competing against it, it's gonna hard for them to grab my attention.", "author": "Rodney H."}

SO GOOD!!!!! I loved everything about the burrito. I am sure it's very unhealthy (has fries, steak, cheese, avocado, etc) but it was so tasty and very filling. It was my first time having the asada fries and I loved the giant mountain of avocado!!!! However, the steak was kind of dry... \n\nSETTING: Pretty spacey inside! There are 8-10 tables, even though I was kind of questioning about the sanitary of the place, because you clean after yourself (you put the plates in a bin in the back) and I didn't see any staff wiping the tables or anything. Parking may be hard. There are a bunch of good bars and desserts places nearby, which is a plus! \n\nSERVICE: Cafeteria style - you order up front and you can serve yourself to a variety of sauces and sides.\n\nOVERALL IMPRESSION: Love it! I have a weak spot for Mexican food and this place definitely satisfied my burrito craving.", "author": "Wendy F."}

It wasn't overly full, but it was exciting in that every corner of the place was filled with some sort of drama going on. There were a couple of bros in tanks waiting for their noms, a peace/make love not war/dreadlock'd couple munching away happily, and even an awkward situation when a worker had to drag a screaming individual out of the store because she wasn't coherent...ah, Mission.\n\nI ordered a shrimp burrito and basically had my stomach FULL, which was the goal anyways. At 1AM, all I'm looking for is something hot, a place to sit/pee, and a spot to get my grub on. Taqueria Los Coyotes is the perfect place for that. \n\nI didn't enjoy their restroom situation, nor did I find the food to be a falvorbomb of awesomeness. But this place is great for late night cravings, and that's that. Their bathroom situation is kind of confusing, and I was also one of the unlucky people who stood in line because the handle was locked. The awkward restrooms are literally connected to the one grand room where customers order their food and sit at the tables...so everyone watches you from their tables while you do the \"bathroom hopscotch\" while you hold your bladder. Later on, a kind but quiet worker who was probably the busser, told me that there was a key to the restrooms around the divider. AND VOILA! Pee problems solved. Everyone after me rejoiced because we were all waiting in line...because the door was locked.\n\nOther than that, the lights are LED and make you feel crusty and unattractive while you wait for your drunk food, but there are tons of seats for your drunk group or for a small pair. There are always people coming in from their boozy adventures looking for a place that can whip up something warm quick! So I felt safe here and easily found street parking for free.\n\nRemember to tip, because the workers on Friday/Saturday are there to serve you, clean up after your messes, AND probably finish closing up shop at 5AM or later.

Look, dude, if you can't understand what someone is saying brush up on your language skills while you are LIVING in a place where most people speak the norm language. Don't get a huffy attitude with me when I'm being polite and as clear as possible, even speaking basic spanish words. \n\nIt is not that hard to understand that I want to add PICO DE GALLO to my burrito. Then that backwards hat jerk had the nerve to LIE to me and say the men's bathroom was broken, just because he was having an attitude problem. Dude, I JUST SAW a man come out of there. So I waited to get my food, stood right near the cashier, and when I saw the men's restroom key I picked it up and went in there anyway. And of course that jerk of a cashier was lying; nothing wrong with the bathroom. I made sure to make direct eye contact with him and the workers on the way out too, daring them to say something to me. They never did. Cowards. \n\nOn the plus side my California Burrito was a fairly good size, and the sour cream/avocado/meat portions seemed just enough and not too little. I substituted chicken for the steak. Came out really good.  \n\nBut I am sick of the mistreatment we have to deal with from local places just to enjoy great food. It's truly sad.

The service was quick which was probably the only good thing. I ordered a veggie burrito, it lacked so much taste and it was also dry and the tortilla tasted half cooked. Regardless, I ate it because I had a long night ahead of me. The waiters took forever to clean up the tables after people left, so there wasn't much open for seating. The music they play here is very loud and almost makes it impossible to hear when talking to someone. Th restaurant could use some cleaning up and a few upgrades.

There is so much competition for Mexican Places right off 16th street especially since El Farolito and La Taqueria are so close, but this place definitely gives the others a run for their money. The Carne Asada Chimichanga was HUGE, think Chipotle size, and came with sour cream and guacamole which I adoreeee. It took longer to make but I only assume it was because they had to fry it compared to the other customers.The burrito itself was filling and definitely lasted me for two meals. However its the salsa bar that separates this place from all the other Burrito eateries. They have a gigantic selection of mild to flaming hot salsas. I ended up trying every single one because I couldn't make up my mind! The mango sweet salsa was by far my favorite though since I can't really handle much spice. They also have this interesting onion/ meat mixture that was delicious and drenched it all over my burrito. I'm not exactly sure what it was but I thought better not to ask since it tasted so damn good. Fantastic seasonings and a plethora of options will definitely have me coming back.", "author": "Lisa H."}

I used to speak very highly of your Mexican fare and service. \n\nNow? Well, you might as well be Pancho Villa across the street (read: YOU'RE DEAD TO ME). \n\nIt all began when I decided to take a table that wasn't fully bussed yet. I pushed the plates aside to make room for my condiments and sauces that I procured from the salsa bar.\n\nI went back for some more stuff, but when I got back the bus-boy threw all my items away. I suppose the crescent moon arrangement of my containers with my receipt was not enough of a marker. \n\nSo, I went back to get more. I tend to use their water cups for condiments because they are bigger (less trips back and forth) and they are reusable (trying somewhat to be greener). This is in comparison to their 1 ounce disposable sauce cups.\n\nAs I'm ladling some green sauce, the cashier lady literally reached across the salsa bar, grabs the cup out of my hand, and starts lecturing me on not using cups for condiments. Maybe they are not happy about the quantity I'm taking? \n\nShe points at these new signs and whatnot while scolding me. I figured there could have been a more hospitable way of letting me know rather than the attitude she was serving. \n\nNo big deal, I'll use 10 of your disposable cups and add to the landfill. So I grab a huge roasted jalape\u00f1o. There's no way it's going to fit in a 1 ounce cup. I decide to put it in a water cup because it just make sense. \n\nAgain, she gets on my case. I try explaining how it won't fit otherwise. She doesn't get it. \n\nThe worst part is when I got my al pastor torta. It barely had any pastor; only dry, crunchy pieces. It actually had more pineapple in it than anything else. I'm pretty sure I'm not in Hawaii and I didn't order a pineapple sandwich. Honestly, one of the worst tortas I've ever had in my life. \n\nIt was nice while it lasted, Los Coyotes. But I'm moving to friendlier pastures.

I shared a carne asada fries and had to wait a bit because there were so many people. The fries came with cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream, and guacamole. There also are ton of different salsas to choose from. But my favorite by far were the grilled onions which also had some small pieces of meat in it as well. The onions were caramelized and added a delicious sweetness. They also gave a really generous nice heaping scoop of guacamole! Just my personal preference, but I wish the fries were a little thicker. However the fries still managed to stay nice and crisp under all that mound of goodness. The location is also super easy to find because it's literally just next to the Bart station. I would come again to try other things on their gigantic menu (which includes tacos, burritos, combo plates, nachos, quesadillas, sopes, pupusas, seafood, etc)!", "author": "Joy W."}

That was us, our high heels did not stop our high standards. One of my friends was very determined and did not stop until we ended up at Los Coyotes.

We managed to order carne asada fries and al pastor tacos. We were not disappointed at all, probably the best decision we made all night actually.

The menudo and the michelada were both better than the much-busier San Jalisco. I cannot comment on the tacos or burritos as I haven't had them yet, but the menudo was wonderful.\n\nThe soup was nicely seasoned, with some herbs (oregano?) cooked into the broth. Unlike some other menudo I've had, this stuff tasted pretty nice even before I added the condiments. The condiments are diced onions and cilantro, lime wedges, chili flakes, and oregano. There are extra lime wedges available on the salsa bar. The soup had lots of very nice tripe in it, and had absolutely no gamey funky flavor. The texture was good and there were just enough fatty bits to make it taste rich without turning it into a bowl of fat. I will be back here for more menudo.

Ummm?? Really?? I then ordered a play of alambres. Okay so at the end I asked her to repeat the order to me because you know of the bean misunderstanding so she was rude and was telling me to look at the screen which was mind you facing her way by then so I told her I can't see... Booom!! It still said black beans!! I told her what is that about? She said she did not have a button for brown whole beans she stated she would tell the cook to add brown whole beans... Waited about half hour for my order to go, she proceeded to hand me my order which was odd because the cooks where calling out all the numbers with orders ready.. anyways I asked her who cooked my food she asked me why I asked her again may I know who cooked my food she then pointed to cook who had prepared my food I asked him if he had replaced the beans as she said she was going to tell him he looked at me crazy and told me he did as it was on the reciept she walked over and asked me sort of mad and said didn't you tell him by then I was livid I told her that's your job not mines to do!!!!

Looking at all the other reviews, it appears that this is THE place that's the closest to a SoCal burrito...and I'll attest to the fact that this place seems pretty legit.\n\nI thought California burritos were only an LA/SD thing, but apparently the style is found here! You know what though, I'm not a HUGE fan of massive heaps of meat in my burrito, but I AM a fan of a nice balance of ingredients and flavor. I REALLY like their salsa bar and they even have the escabeche (pickled carrots, jalapenos and onions) which is always a nice condiment to my burritos! \n\nAnother thing I really like about this place is the decor. Unlike some of the other Mexican joints on Mission, this place is actually pretty clean and open and bright. The tiles and paintings inside add a nice, festive touch to the interior...and for a moment I actually felt like I was eating food in Rosarito. It was also nice having the live guitar player singing a few traditional songs. All that was needed to complete the package was to pop open a Corona.\n\nBottom line: Food was delicious, portions were great (especially if you SUPER size your meal), their drinks look all freshly prepared, they accept credit cards, and their salsa bar rocks!

Arrived on plates with beans, rice, salad, avocado, and sour cream.  Accompanied by a stack of warm, toasted, fragrant, and oiled corn tortillas.  The food was flavorful and well-cooked.  Taco-making happily ensued.  \n\nFinally, no trip to a taqueria was complete for me without trying Taco Pescado, two lovely tortillas topped with grilled fish (with blackened edges), lightly stewed tomatoes, raw onion, cilantro, and salsa verde.  Quite simply, one of the best tacos I had on this California trip.

And this is the restaurants' most popular dish too. \n\nFor $6.25 I get the chopped and grilled Carne Asada (grilled steak) meat, a splash of sour cream, avocado, cheese, and spicy salsa tossed crazily on top of fast food-like French Fries. You'll need a fork to eat this messy dish. After one bite of the dish, made me recalled my time in San Diego a few weeks ago. I thought the dish is good up hear, but I'm not sure how will people from San Diego will judge the dish from this place. My dish: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZAPitG9126yVupKWHp54yA?select=kexlJWCPymnC3Hsxg5Fp0g\n\nAs I was enjoying my meal, many people ordered the Menudo. One of the items I might try along with a super burrito on my sure next visit. \n\nI also like the selection of hot sauces for us to use at the table. Hot sauce: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZAPitG9126yVupKWHp54yA?select=NRCbthDRbXlyHy0s4SRgmQ\n\nThis amazingly clean taqueria accepted my Visa for my meal.\n\nGreat hours too, where Fridays and Saturdays are closed at 3am to accommodate the weekend drunk crowds. \n\nA favorite of Yelp's too with the sticker on the main door.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZAPitG9126yVupKWHp54yA?select=4b3xLBcTti4rpyRf5WiGrQ", "author": "Matt G."}

Ordered the California burrito, which was basically a French fry and avocado burrito, barely any meat in it.  Had one homeless guy offer to buy me a beer so he could use the washroom. (I gave him the money for the beer I didn't want because I felt bad). Then had two homeless people come to my table and straight up ask for money.  Then another guy came in and started playing Mexican music which was cool, until he started walking the tables asking for tips.  At least his hustle is more respectable than the first two.

Or as I remembered, some taqueria place by the ally across from the BART. It was 12:30 and we ordered steak quesadillas to share. I went for the roasted jalapenos. Burns my tongue just perfectly. C, who was accompanying me, and I sat next to each other, he's giving me stories of his latest romance intrigues and I'm busy drinking water to ease my burn. C and I often eat out late. Some hole in the wall kind of places but always great food. He's left landed like me, which makes it easy for me to grab his sauce (mango salsa) and not feel like I'd bump into his other hand which was holding a fork. I had remembered the last time I was here a girlfriend of mine was telling me how her date flaked out on her and failed to uber her a car back to where she parked. Then another time E and I were telling each other stories after he just returned from Europe and after we had gone to the Armory for an event. \n\nI start to think about all those friends who have been in my life and how I often eat at this restaurant. It has become clear to me at that moment when food is this good, I wold then choose to bring my closest friends here. It's an unlikely place. Really. Given it has really bright lights in a rather sterile setting. It's not an ambiance restaurant, that's for sure. But the food is good.\n\nAs it turns out, I crave human connections as much as I crave home made pupusas. \n\nFor that reason, this place holds special memories just like Citizen Band. It's one of those restaurants that you just would not think that would leave you with lasting impressions. Yet it does. So you come back, over and over again. Each time with your best of best friends, creating yet another ever lasting memory.", "author": "Victoria E."}

I see the California Burrito on the menu along with some other local specialties.\n\nPlucking away the foil, I was salivating at the thought of nice toasty french fries lined up with carne asada and sour cream in one bite.  That fantasy was short lived, at which after the second bite I was trying to figure out how the execution was flawed.  \n\nThe fries were a bad excuse and the carne asada was flavorless.  Throw some garlic fries from Super Duper into an El Farolito burrito and there you will have a muy guapo good time. \n\nThis didn't do it for me; nice clean establishment in the heart of 16th st. but already that calls for red flags.

They laughed, I sang along in my head, \"Ay, ay, ay, ay, canta y no llores.\"\n\nAfter I got my food, I went to the salad bar to load up on tomatillo sauce. Clutsy me spilled sauce all over the place. Boo. I took a bunch of napkins and tried cleaning it up, but I couldn't find a trash can to put the dirty napkins in. I looked everywhere, but I was in a rush, so I kept them in my hand and hauled all my crap with me to throw it away outside. The bag they gave me was heavy as heck, and the handles on the plastic bag almost ripped from all the weight.\n\nWhen I got to my meeting, I opened up the boxes of food. The chimichanga was GINORMOUS! Once I opened it, I had to eat the end to snap the box closed. Holy moly! The carne asada fries also came in a huge portion, so I felt kinda stupid (I didn't think one order was enough to fill me up). I didn't find any utensils or napkins in my bag, so the gentleman sitting next to me walked down the street to the deli to get me some. Happyface.\n\nI couldn't finish more than 3/4 of the carne asada fries, but they were so good! I didn't have any more than about two bites of the chimichanga, it was too much. I ended up having to throw it all away ): I was sad. I usually eat like a champion, but that was just so much food. Yowzas.\n\nOverall, I was pretty darn happy. Had they had a few trash cans in the restaurant and left me some napkins with a fork, I'd be happier.\n\nI'm loading up on drinks next time, and a California burrito (and maybe some papusas)!", "author": "Elaine N."}

Huge as in almost larger than a super burrito. They come with beans as well. Next time I might skip beans, as there is plenty of other protein in the burrito. The eggs and ham were cooked well and the portion of all ingredients was perfect. Overall great burrito. They are huge though...I would definitely split one if you can even if you're really hungry.\n\nAnother plus...they have an amazing salsa bar. I love spicy green salsa with avocados in it, and theirs is awesome. They have a few different salsas to chose from. Something for everyone.\n\nThe restaurant is actually pretty nice. Everything looked very clean and it looks like a nice place to eat. Nothing fancy, but I would have dinner here. I saw they have a grapefruit margarita...that sounds amazing. They also have sangria and of course beer, etc. The menu is SO BIG! It's a bit overwhelming actually. I can't imagine that there is anything else that could possibly be offered at a Mexican restaurant.

While adventuring in the Mission, a local friend suggested we go munch at this spot. Upon entering the taqueria, I was gladly overwhelmed by the endless possibilities of Mexican food awesomeness. From traditional plates to California burritos and everything in between, this spot definitely has every type of Mexican cuisine dish to satisfy that craving. After gawking at the menu for like 10 minutes, I finally settled for a carne asada wet burrito. As you're purchasing your food, there are stacks on top of stacks of tortilla chip baskets for you to munch on. What differentiates this spot's tortilla chip baskets is the fact that you can get blue corn chips, regular tortilla chips, or the veggie kind and all at no cost. Their salsa bar is also crackin' because they offer hella options and even grilled jalapenos. As for the wet burrito..OH MY GOODNESS seriously the BEST wet burrito I've ever had period. I loved how it was massive and stuffed with the most delicious carne asada I've ever had. It was also epic how they piled on the sour cream, guacamole, and salsa fresca on top of it. It was seriously so amazing that I inhaled the entire thing (I felt like such a fatty after, but so worth it) Of course I had to wash it down with some super refreshing horchata.

But the second time I was stone cold sober like a good mommy of a 10 month old should be.\n\nAfter buying our couch at El Corazon Gallery (review to come upon delivery of said goods), we drove down Mission looking for some high quality Mexican food.  I'm from San Diego and they know how to GET DOWN on that comida, so I'm kind of a snob when it comes to Bay Area \"mexican\" eateries.  I remembered eating at this place a few years back and suggested it to my chauffer, AKA boyfriend.  He happily obliged since he trusts my impeccable taste in burritos and the like.  Parking was super easy and the line was short when we walked in.  All the cooks greeted us and the guy at the register took our order.\n\nCarne asada torta\nEnchiladas plate, no salsa or guacamole\nCarne asada fries, no salsa or guacamole\nCheese quesadilla, no salsa or guacamole\n\nSee the pattern?\n\nThe gentleman who took our order caught on to the trend halfway through the order and asked if everything be prepared sans salsa and guacamole.  Total gem.  I don't like onions and I'm swell-up-like-the-elephant-man allergic to avocados.  Odd since my grandfather made his living growing them.  But that's the irony of my life.\n\nThe salsa bar was extensive and delicious, minus the avocado one that looked like a tasty green heaven I'd die from.  The salsa verde was SO GOOD.  A little spicy for my half-white tastebuds, but the sour cream calmed the firestorm and I ate enough chile verde to bleed salsa.  The mild salsa was pretty excellent as well.  However, I just dipped the little plastic cup into the concoction and walked away with the liquid, no tomatoes, no onions.  DON'T JUDGE ME!\n\nThe enchiladas were so friggin' fantastic.  Half red sauce, half green sauce, complete taste bud delight.  The carne asada fries were definitely a worthy adversary to San Diego's offerings, but Santana's in San Diego runs the market on the fries.  Sorry Los Coyotes.  The quesadilla was perfectly crisp with the right texture of melted cheese.  Of course I slathered it in that little verde river of happiness.  Sadly, I could not taste the torta because my boyfriend \"accidentally\" forgot to say no avocado.  But between you, me and the rest of yelp...I think he did it so I wouldn't consume half of his meal.  Clever man!\n\nSo yes, I answered my question of whether or not this place is actually that good or if beer belly reigned supreme.  It is THAT good.

YES, California burritos does exist in San Francisco believe it or not. The California burrito already comes with steak. The first bite was good but after that, it just started to go down hill. The burrito to me was a little dry and kinda wished they had some salsa in it. There was a lot of avocado in it too that you couldn't really taste the fries. \n\nI've been craving carne asada fries for a while and I most definitely bought that too. It's pretty rare to find carne asada fries especially in San Francisco and this is the only place I know that sells it. There is one in San Bruno but theirs does not compare to the one here. Anyways, the actual carne asada in the fries did not taste like carne asada . Like in Call Me Z's review, it was like grilled flank steak. Other than that, it was still good. The size of the fries reminds me of the ones from McDonalds. \n\nI'm hoping to go to San Diego soon to try the authentic California burrito and carne asada fries. Most of my friends who have gone to SD, I have told them to try it out and bring me some if it's good. They told me how good it is and all but unfortunately, they never bring me back a california burrito. Womp womp.\n\nOn the other hand, the menu is very big and seem very overwhelming. Thank god I already knew what I wanted because I was not gonna look at that huge menu lolll\n\nI got some salsa from the salsa bar and for some reason, it didn't have the juice of the tomatoes in it or whatever you want to call it. It was just straight up tomatoes, onions, etc. It didn't really seem like salsa to me cause I like to dip my chips and get some of that juice. I don't know if it's just like that or someone just took all the juice from salsa. Lol", "author": "Janice V."}

My bf said that a few friends took him there and that he couldn't remember where the place was located\n\nSo while we were driving, I was getting aggravated, he was getting aggravated.  I guess when two people are hungry you definitely do not want to be around them cause that's when the  (BITCH MODE, give me food) comes out .

But when we went inside surprisingly there was a good amount of people.  \n\nHe had ordered the Carne asada fries.  And I ordered the Chicken taco salad.  They were both delicious but I ended up eating his instead.  I gotta tell you the carna asada fries were off the hook and too dang irresistible.

Being empty at the time I came in, I took and chance and upon receiving my highly priced $9.21 super burrito I noticed this it was double  wrapped with aluminum foil.  When I finally got through two layers of aluminum foil, I realized my Super Burrito was falling apart as it was not wrapped up properly in addition It literally was dripping with every bite.  Basically the liquids with the beans and meat was not properly drained causing it to be soggy and fall apart on me.  I really didn't enjoy it as this created a huge mess and a major waste of money.  In addition there was little to any sour cream and guacamole that accompanies the Super Burrito, mostly rice, beans and some meat.  Lesson learned, will go back to El Farallito with the affordable super burrito that doesn't fall apart on you.", "author": "JERRY B."}

Not on the basis of the carne asada fries burrito, anyway, since that's pretty uncommon for Northern California.  I will say this, though: the concept is genius. Here you have a taqueria at the end of a street filled with bars, that's open late, cheap, serves comfort food and is the last thing between you and BART/MUNI/where the cabs pick up. Of course it's going to make money! \n\nThe burrito was pretty ok, but after a night of drinking and dancing it was just what I needed. Not all comfort food has a positive additive effect when combined - pickles and ice cream only works if you're really high or really pregnant - but I can safely say that fries and burritos hit the spot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-20", "description": "I feel like an outsider giving Taqueria Los Coyotes such a low rating, but I have my reasons. After catching a movie, a friend and I headed to the Mission to get a bite to eat. It was getting close to 1 A.M. and options began to get limited. I took to Yelp and looked up his recommendation and Los Coyotes definitely has a faithful following. It was packed and it wasn't 2 A.M. yet, when all the nearby bars close up shop. The menu is HUGE. A fellow Yelper said over 100 items/combinations! In my opinion, it's overwhelming. There's just too much. You don't know where to begin. \n\nAnd with that, you have everything you can imagine: burritos, tacos, quesadillas, nachos, flautas, sopes, pupusas, tortas, salads, tostada salads, seafood, shrimp cocktails, entrees, dinner plates, and much, much more. I'm always a little skeptical about places with such large menus because it's easy to lose focus and put out stuff just for the sake of having it on your menu.\n\nI took to my usual Mexican taste test, which is three tacos. I ordered three regular tacos, two al pastor, and one pollo asado. I ordered it with \"everything,\" which is onion, cilantro, and hot sauce. The three tacos and soft drink came to $9 and change. Even with the big crowd, we were able to get a table as people come and go in waves. \n\nThe food order took about 10 minutes, while my friend's shrimp plate took 15 minutes or longer, but was piping hot that he burned himself. As for my food, there was something \"off\" with my al pastor tacos. The meat look deep fried, crispy, and burnt. It tasted just as it looked. Horrible. The meat was nothing like al pastor, but tasted like bacon bits. When I think al pastor, I don't think bacon bits. A huge disappointment. I will say that my chicken taco was delicious and full of flavor. The salsa bar has tons to choose from and go perfect with your burrito or tacos. The chips, however, were dry, hard, and had no flavor.\n\nAs we finished up, it began to get massively crowded as most bars were letting out. While leaving, I noticed that the al pastor rotisserie had no meat on it. I'm guessing I got the scraps or whatever they could scrape up to make my two tacos. Instead of doing this, I would of much liked them to tell me they were out of al pastor rather then giving me burnt scraps. I will give them another try, maybe not so late, and update my review if need be.\n\nPros:\n+ Dyson Airblade hand dryer \n+ HUGE menu \n+ Friendly service\n+ Reasonable prices\n+ Large dining area\n+ Serves alcohol\n+ Late night hours\n\nCons:\n- Late night/drunk crowd\n- Food availability and quality may vary towards the end of the night", "author": "Alexander E."}

Sober me actually got the message some how, and around noon the next day, I headached my way down to 16th and Mission to see if I was just dreaming or not. \n\nWhen I got there, I was so happy it was retarded. Mostly because there wasn't some crazy guy trying to sell me expired bus transfers or crack inside. My head was pounding and I was pretty sure that the act of standing was enough to make me pass out, but I soldiered on to the front of the small line that had formed and ordered myself a California burrito and a Coke. \n\nAfter a few minutes my number was called and I hobbled over to grab my delicious miniature sleeping bag of beef. It smelled amazing, and as I peeled back the foil, my heart skipped a beat. Could this be real southern California style Mexican food only blocks away from me?\n\nI bit in, chewed, ignored the pounding sensation in my head, and was delighted. Not only did this burrito taste like Thor himself forged it from the volcanoes of Mexico, but it cured my hangover damn near instantly. \n\nSince that day, I tend to stop by far too often and I don't give a fuck. So far, it's the best place I've found in SF that makes Mexican food that doesn't taste like asshole and shattered dreams. In fact, it's down right tasty.", "author": "Mark P."}

So take the risk and your taste buds will appreciate it. \n\nThe place hosts a large menu capturing an entire wall space, so whatever you might be looking for in terms of Mexican food, it's sure to be found.  I'm a huge fan of carne asada fries, and though it can't really compare to carne asada fries from SoCal, it still satisfies, especially when you're dying for food. Fries were well done and there's a large salsa bar with chips.    My friend ordered a regular burrito, fairly large, and enjoyed it as well.  \n\nSince food is cooked relatively fresh and upon order, it did take us some time to get our food--about 10/15 minutes, but the place was packed so sort of understandable I suppose.  Prices were relatively cheap for SF, but considering there were only a handful of options for late night in SF and that Denny's on Mission is usually always packed beyond belief on a Saturday night, I was satisfied to get the deal I got-around $7 for large plate of the fries drenched with sour cream, carne asada, guacamole, cheese, beans, etc.\n\nI would probably give this place 3.5 stars but being a place open with good grub not too far from clubs give it that extra 0.5.", "author": "Chris E."}

This is the sort of place you stumble into at 1 a.m. when you started the night with shots of cheap tequila.\n\nFood: Top-notch. I can't reiterate it enough. I brought a foodie friend here who has the highest of standards and the place passed with flying colors. You can watch the chefs make your food, an ability I appreciate since I'm a perpetual student of food preparation, and these guys seriously know what they're doing. The salsa bar is well-stocked -- my favorite is the avocado salsa, but definitely try the mango; it's sweet but maintains the kick that any good salsa should possess.\n\nService: While not a requirement, the staff always appreciates someone who makes an effort to communicate in Spanish. They're always super helpful and timely.\n\nYou'll be in and out quickly most days, but if you go on a weekend night, be prepared to wait a good while since the place will be super packed with people who spent all day getting sloshed at Dolores.\n\nOverall, I can't imagine anyone finding much better Mexican food in the Mission, and you certainly won't find any that's cheaper.

So of course i thought it would be romantic to bring my date for a California burrito..   \nThe place is crowded full to busting with local yocals and local hipsters the both. I get the California and ask for no white sauce.. confused by my request I had to clarify \"Sour Cream.\" White sauce is what we usually call it back in the mother land.\nI sampled the horchata and affirmed my suspicions of its assumed graininess. I swallow it with a grimace on my hand covered face as to not be obvious.. I miss the sweet smooth milky horchata of southern californias many many taco joints. It upsets me that up here they actually charge you more than regular fountain drinks for jamaica, horchata, ect..  alas.. not agaus frescas. \nThe place was constipated with orders. So much so that they didn't bother to clean up for incoming patrons. The place was pretty much filthy.. and on V-Day! it seemed like ages before I got my order. In that span of at least 15 minutes I had to use the restroom.. joint was tarnished with norteno graffiti and floor piss. Thank god that had an automated urinal and dyson dryer... after about ten more minutes of waiting our number was called and i got the burritos.. First thing I noticed was the size.. It was a fat log that could sit up as a vertical cylinder all on its own, phallus like even... I smiled. First bite i noticed it was very dry... VERY VERY dry... No pico... I had to add my own Salsa.. I get up and grab some salsa, and a lime and begin a process of bite, add salsa, lime it, bite and repeat... I also noticed while there was cheese, there was a considerable lack of it.. If you like your joints cheesy this might not be the place for you.. It was a decent burrito.. for San Francisco standards it was the best I've ever had.. but that's not saying much. It was cool to see that the restaurant allowed in local mariachi's to come in and perform for their clientele. After I downed my long pound, i backed a pepsi and bounced.\n\nVerdict A-OK. \nI Appreciated the fresh guac, already in the burrito with no extra charge, The crisp and tenderness of the Carne asada, and the cleanliness of the salsa bar, but they could have kept the common areas clean along with the restroom, and maybe a second cook to help with the orders. \n Next..

Among many great choices, this one's a top contender.\n\nThe menu is absurdly ginormous. I haven't even started checking the more interesting choices- just sticking with basics so far. They have items I haven't seen around here, such as the san-diego style California burrito (with fries in it.)  They've earned repeat visits so I can try their ceviches.  \n\nIt's a clean and beautiful place to sit down, and the appetizing spread of ingredients at the counter is matched by the colors of the very well maintained dining area.   Everything is super fresh and they go the extra mile to give fresh house-made chips, multicolor, and not inferior bagged ones.  The tomatoes in the burrito I just had stood out- which isn't easy to say about tomatoes these days.  I appreciated the freshness of stuff at the salsa bar too. They have a mango salsa I haven't had elsewhere- however the avocado salsa verde was mild (I like it hot as hell).  They seem to hold back on spice compared to some other places.  With the burrito and 4 salsas I just had, they didn't make me sweat and need a drink break.  It did help the other flavors stand out strongly, but I'd have to take some roast jalepenos from the bar next time.  I prefer spice as hot as I can stand.  \n\nI compare it to Pancho Villa across the street where I was a regular for a while- I got bored of them. I don't think I could ever be bored of this places' choices.  Although Pancho does do excellent spicier salsas.\n\nFor a few other comparisons- I'd say El Tonayense on 24th street is also beautiful for sitting, and they do something amazing to their beans.  For late night when these are closed, Cancun on Mission around 19th is solid.  You could do well at any of these places, but Los Coyotes impresses with it's selection.

I'm talking about flautas, tortas, lengua burritos. Oh god, their tortas are seriously the best I can think of in recent memory.

I definitely recommend the carne asada fries and micheladas -- kind of like a bloody Mary but with beer instead of vodka - super filling!

The place is like a beacon of drunken hope among the many taquerias clogged with other drunkards of the night. It's certainly bigger than most and one of the more elaborately decorated ones in the neighborhood. As my friend had put it, \"It's like the Mission Sistine Chapel up in this piece.\" Well said, friend. Well said.\n\nOther than the visual stimulation of the establishment which had a telenovela on the screen or maybe a futbol match, you'll notice the massive menu they have looming over them. There's just so much to order that you just feel like ordering everything! They even have California burritos and carne asada fries. My carb deprived body immediately craves it along with a huge horchata. Instead I reason with myself and settle for some guaca fries which had, you guessed it, fries topped with cheese and guacamole. Such a simple concept and yet so delicious. The pupusas weren't bad either. Actually I would bet big money that the rest of their menu tastes pretty damn good, too. And yes, that's a lot on the menu. And they have a nice salsa bar, too. Very clean. Very sanitary. I like finding those traits in my salsa bars.\n\nSo all in all, if you find yourself around 16th St, just stumbling around with some hunger pangs, stumble on in to this place and get your grub on. Just don't order the party platter, even though at the time you thought you were hungry enough to eat a party platter full of chicken wings, you really can't. I know.... from experience. Oh, to be drunk and young in the Mission... but I digress. Either way, check this place out!\n\n...and how many times did I say \"drunk\" in this review? Haha, you can enjoy this place sober, too!

So I was happy to find myself in the neighborhood at the right time with a strong hankering for tacos.\n\nI had 3 tacos: al pastor, carnitas, and pollo.  Everything looked right when they arrived.  Each taco featured two corn tortillas, a healthy helping of meat, the standard raw onion/cilantro topping, and a squirt of roasted chile/tomato salsa.  After gobbling them down (I was hungry), I took a moment to reflect on flavor: good but not great, a bit too high on the grease-to-flavor ratio.  (If it's gonna be greasy, it better be flavorful).  But still a solid taco.  In order of quality, high-to-low, I'd have to go pollo, al pastor, then carnitas.    \n\nOther features worth mentioning: it's a horribly impersonal, plastic-filled setting, like most taco stops, though I still got service with a smile.

I know that the quality of an establishment's buche is in no way related to whether or not they put too much sour cream on their vegetarian burritos. But, well, I don't rightly care. Vegetarians exist, and we frequent taquerias, too, dagnabbit.\n\nBut this is a taqueria that I will not be frequenting. I've eaten here once before, and while I was gazing longingly at Pancho Villa the other night, I thought maybe by eating at Los Coyotes I'd save a couple dollars. Wrong. My burrito, which was a seriously stripped-down version of their basic veggie burrito (which boasts \"mixed veggies\"--NOT what I want on a burrito), containing only rice, beans, lettuce, jalape\u00f1o and salsa verde, came out to $5.20. What?!? I can get the same burrito at a taco truck for $2.50 and for maybe $4 at a similar taqueria--because, unlike Los Coyotes, most places reduce the cost of your food when you omit ingredients. \n\nFine. Whatever. Throw it in the back of my mind for later grumbles. Except that I gave the dude behind the counter $6 and he didn't give me my change back. I could have said something, yes, but I figured it was better to just let it go. However, upon thinking about it a little more, that's pretty lame. Tip isn't determined by the cashier, and he owed me 80 cents. Being literally ripped off when you're overpaying for 75 cents worth of ingredients = frowny face. \n\nThe burrito itself was good. Not too big, not too small, with lotsa jalape\u00f1o for to make my mouth burn. The selection of chips (you grab your own basket) included normal tortilla chips, red and black tortilla chips, and multi-colored flour tortilla chips. Fancy. And the salsa bar! I'll give Los Coyotes props for their clean, well-stocked salsa bar, which includes pico de gallo, salsa verde, a couple other red salsas, a pineapple salsa (at least on this visit), radishes, big slices of lime, and a whole bunch of nopales. Clearly, I had to have most of these, because I am a pig. So by the end, although I didn't finish my chips, my nopales or my burrito, I felt like I was going to vomit. That says something about my burrito, at least: I kept eating after I was full because it was tasty. But, then, I've never been one to waste a perfectly good burrito...\n\nI can't say anything about the meat, obviously, but they have a pretty standardly wide variety of meats and seafoods for your tacos, burritos, whatever. Maybe it's good, maybe it isn't. For vegetarians like myself, they also serve pupusas, veggie tortas (wish I'd gotten one) and veggie tacos. However, the tacos are something like $2.50 or $2.75, which I pretty much refuse to pay for a taco unless there's some serious special goin' on up in them tortillas. But, as was the case with my burrito, the tacos don't seem all that special.\n\nTwo stars because the food is overpriced and because the dude didn't give me my damn change (not cool). Add one on because my burrito was pretty tasty, the guys who work there are pretty cute, and, mostly, for the salsa bar. As for the customers...the girl sitting for 30 minutes receiving text messages with her cell phone on blast kind of annoyed me, as did the (kinda hot) hipster in his tight cutoff shorts...because, while I understand that looking like an idiot is important to the hipster and that wearing overly tight and overly short cutoffs that clash with your filthy Eurotrash white leather shoes helps achieve this end, IT WAS COLD AND RAINING.\n\nI don't plan on eating here again.", "author": "Ashley M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-05-09", "description": "When I first moved to San Francisco a few years ago, I only cared about two things:  seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and finding a place that served carne asada fries.  Only the first thing happened.  This was a problem because carne asada fries are like crack in that once you get a taste, you will never be truly happy until you get more.\n\nMuch like the California burrito (which Los Coyotes also serves, which is basically a regular burrito with the addition of french fries), carne asada fries are a very Southern California thing and involve disgusting (amazing) amounts of french fries, sour cream, guacamole, salsa, and BEEF.  They're like nachos, but better because the trans fat from the fries makes everything taste extra delicious.\n\nLuckily, a few places have popped up around the city purporting to carry carne asada fries, like Olivo's in the Tenderloin and Taqueria El Sol in Parkside, but my favorite place (read:  the place closest to where I live) to get them is here.  For $6.25 plus tax, all the guilt that comes along with knowingly ingesting something so unhealthy can be yours.\n\nCarne asada fries are up on the actual menu at Los Coyotes now, which is a shame because when they first started making them, there was just  a janky flyer taped to the cash register that read, \"Now serving carne azada fries.\"  That was almost the best part of the experience.\n\nThe carne asada super burrito is really good here too, if you want to stick with normal food.  It's pretty big and a bit cheaper than other nearby taquerias, like Pancho Villa.  Also, they serve margaritas for a mere $3.50.  I'm talking guy behind a makeshift bar mixing these drinks, not some kind of rip-off margarita machine.  Pound a couple of these and save yourself a few bucks before heading to a real bar where that vodka soda's gonna cost you $10.", "author": "Christy J."}

Have we eaten at the same taqueria? \n\nYou know, as I begin to write this review I find myself at a loss of words. I am not a mean or unfair person and actually feel a bit bad writing it. That said I feel a duty to my fellow yelpers to produce honest reviews so here goes...\n\nWe arrived at Taqueria Los Coyotes yesterday with a nice buzz (we had been chillin at Elixir) and and a hearty appetite! It was Sunday, around 4 o' clock, and the place was a mess. Every single unoccupied table was piled high with dirty dishes, half eaten plates, food messes, etc. \"Do they buss the tables here?\" I wondered to myself. Well, they did appear busy. That has got to be a good sign, right? After paying for our order which was kinda pricey I might add, (1 super flautas, 1 shrimp torta, 2 cokes = $25, WTF?!) I made a beeline for the restroom. \n\nInside the restroom the toilet had what appeared to be bloody urine dribbled on the seat. \"HOLY S**T, I did NOT just see that!\" I tell myself. What to do? Should I go complain about the bloody, pissy, toilet or do I attempt to remedy the problem myself? I decided against complaining. Instead I put about 13 seat covers on the toilet which covered it in its entirety, and copped a squat. (There was no way I was sitting on that thing!)\n\newwwwwwwwww!!!!!!!!!\n\n(SHUDDER)\n\nmoving along....\nAfter joining my girlfriend at our table I was a bit grossed out but decide to let it go. I was starving. Impressed with the fact that this place had a salsa bar (a lot of places don't) I sampled 4. They were all however TASTELESS. Yes, the pico de gallo, verde, roja, and spicy were all completely flavorless. I found myself eating the tortilla chips plain with salt which is obviously not a good thing.\n\nAlthough our food arrived reasonably quickly (15 min) it was a HUGE disappointment. My flautas plate was bland, flavorless, and pretty much looked like slop. I salted the ish out of my food and ate about a third of my plate. That was all that my stomach would tolerate. \nMy girlfriend's torta actually looked pretty good, but I sampled a renegade shrimp that had fallen on her plate and it tasted like dirt. There is nothing worse then old seafood. It will rot your insides. I reasoned with her to stop eating but being that she was a little intoxicated, famished, and less particular then I am she kept on. She paid for her choice later on that night.\n\nNow I must say that I know good Mexican food. I have happily enjoyed everything from high end Mexican cuisine, to taco truck Mex. Simply put: good food, is good food. Taqueria Los Coyotes did not serve us good food. In fact it was probably some of the worst taqueria grub I have ever had. Add to that a dirty interior and a bio-hazard of a bathroom...I will NEVER step foot in that place again.", "author": "Miss T."}

The steak was not Carne Asada, but was plainly grilled flank steak.  They put too much avacado in it, not enough cheese and sour cream, and the fries were meh. It wasn't a bad burrito, it was just trying to be something it wasn't.\n\nThey have an extensive menu here, so I'll go back and try their other stuff too. The restaurant is large, clean, and with lots of tables.  It's pretty cheap and the portions are good size. The salsa was not as spicy as I like, but they have some habanero hot sauce on the table if you're looking to shit fire.", "author": "Call Me Z."}

I had just gotten onto the 9 near Civic Center when I realized it was 6:55 p.m., and my meeting wasn't till eight.\n\nI got off at 16th Street and decided to catch the 22 or 33 to the Mission to grab a burrito.  The 22 came really quick, and while walking to Pancho Villa, I decided to give Los Coyotes a try since Pancho Villa always seems to ruin all my opportunies to Yelp new taquerias.\n\nWhen I walked inside, I was pleasantly surprised.  It's not exactly nice, but it's more expansive than I thought it would be, and the seating area was semi-pleasant.  (I was expecting the absolute worst in taqueria ambiance.)  I dutifully waited in line and decided I would order my burrito to go just to be safe--even though I had almost fifty minutes to get to work.\n\nI should have known as I waited in line.  Instead of the typical SF-style-burrito setup in which there are people waiting to take (and make) your order, at Los Coyotes you wait in line to order at the cash register.  There was one guy cooking, and although he was going as fast as he could, he wasn't getting much done.  Still, the line moved at a decent clip, and right before I ordered, the guy who had been taking orders began helping the cook (someone else started taking orders), so I figured I'd have my burrito in no time.\n\nI took a seat and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited some more.\n\nThe \"helper\" had gone back to taking orders while the woman didn't do anything.  The main cook even took out orders to people at their tables.  Mind you, this was a little after seven on a Wednesday night.\n\nI kept waiting.\n\nAnd waiting.\n\nI was getting worried that I would be late for work, but really, was that possible?  At one point, I was thinking of leaving, but I was hungry, and I didn't want to throw money down the drain.\n\nI waited.\n\nAnd waited some more.\n\nTwenty-four minutes after I had ordered it, my burrito was ready.  Yes, you read correctly.  Twenty-four minutes.  In that time, I could have ordered and eaten three burritos at Pancho Villa.\n\nMy late burrito in tow, I proceeded to wait for the bus.  The 33 wasn't coming, so I hopped on a 22 and got off at 16th & Potrero.  The NextMuni sign said two minutes till the next 9 came, but then that changed to seven minutes, so I had to walk to work.\n\nI was five minutes late for the meeting, which isn't a big deal, but then I didn't get to eat my burrito till later.\n\nThe burrito itself was OK, but really, twenty-four minutes?  I might give this place another chance, as some of the stuff the guy was making looked amazing, but I might have to eat before I come here just so that I don't die of hunger while I'm waiting for my food.", "author": "John S."}

I am really disappointed in their service.  I was there last Wednesday, and left my fave scarf there on a chair at one of their tables.   As soon as I realized I left it there I called them, and asked about it.  The guy described it (cream with spotty black - batik like), so they had it. I gave them my name and he said it would be there.  I told him I would be there within th the next couple of days.  I go there on Friday and its gone.  They said that I should come back with the night shift cause they might know, so I came back in the evening, and they still didn't know.  The guy that said it was there, was there and reiterated that it was there and that he didn't know what happened to it.  I kept asking about speaking to the manager and they could n't give me a direct time when he would be there.  Then when I went back again during the day to catch the manager, I missed him again, and they said \"oh yes, it was here but was given to someone who walked up to their lost and found area.\"  What!?  Why didn't you say that before.  Again I asked to speak to the manager, and they couldn't give e a time he would be around.  I left my number, at this point for the 3rd time and have not heard back from anybody.  Honestly, I think someone in the restaurant took my scarf.  \nSo what's my deal?  Yeah, I shouldn't of forgotten it, but just the whole customer service was crappy.  I just wanted to speak to the manaer to see if he had seen it.  If I had spoke to him, I would have dropped it, but the staff was evasive.  The scarf means a lot to me, so I thought I would try...  So, don't expect great service here.", "author": "Sandra N."}

The new release is designed to allow customers to realize an immediate taste-to-value solution as well as expand Los Coyote's market leading suite of solutions to contain, control and remove Drunken Food Cravings (DFC). \n\nThe California Burrito combines carne asada, french fries, cheese, sour cream and avocado hosted on a single tortilla platform. By replacing legacy burrito components such as rice and lettuce in favor of Things That Are Fatty Taste Good (TTAFTG) technologies, the California Burrito mitigates the hunger-risk associated with Painting the Town Red (PtTR) by providing the end-user with the optimal mixture of fats, proteins and fried-foods. \n\n\"In today's economic environment, customers face increasing pressure to implement DFC solutions that are not only within a restricted budget and taste good, but have the right nutritional elements in place to combat unnecessary hangovers,\" said analyst Dave G., BurrITo co-founder and CTO. \"Hangovers are the number one cause of lethargy, malaise, and not doing your laundry. The synergy the California Burrito provides by tasting great and easing the discomfort related to PtTR puts it at a competitive advantage as a disruptive force amongst other DFC solutions.\" \n\n\"Long has San Francisco needed to leverage the technological burrito advancements taking place in Southern California,\" said Leonard Coyote, CEO, Taqueria Los Coyotes. \"With proven customer deployments in the Mission District, the largest San Francisco burrito market, the California Burrito is proof that Los Coyotes is committed to bringing its patrons forward thinking and innovative offerings as we continue to define our future vision for the MDB market.\"\n\nAbout Taqueria Los Coyotes:\nTaqueria Los Coyotes is dedicated to providing quick, healthy and affordable solutions for hungry customers. Los Coyote's family of burrito, taco, quesadilla, nacho and dinner plate solutions provide flexible hunger-based control enabling intelligent and granular DFC decision making.\n\nMedia Contact\nhttp://daveg.yelp.com", "author": "Dave G."}

Before we found it though, we walked by some of the other restaurants within a block or two on Mission. While they all looked like the food was good, most of them had lousy or non-existent decor and there were an awful lot of sketchy looking people on the street, practically blocking the restaurant doorways, which really didn't encourage us to walk in (not their fault of course). Los Coyotes is a half block off of Mission, on 16th St. and the inside was much nicer than the other places, with tile mosaic tables and pretty spacious area. So we stayed and ate there. I had the Red Mole Chicken plate: whole beans, rice, a little melted cheese and a huge serving of tender white meat chicken with plenty of mole sauce and 4 homemade corn tortillas. I liked it but thought the mole sauce was kind of bland. In all fairness, I have nothing to compare it to because I've never had a red mole guiza before, but I thought it would have something more interesting about the flavor. I added squeezes of lime and a few drops of hot sauce, which helped. It was enough food for 2 meals easily, so I ended up taking a lot of it home. My dh's fish burrito was fine, and very filling. He couldn't finish it there, so took the rest home to finish later. It looks like most reviews are for burritos and tacos, but they have a really extensive menu with lots of choices.

I have to say, Los Coyotes makes a strikingly damn good version of it.  \n\nI've tried numerous restaurants that offer their take on the cali burrito but I've always left with a full stomach, but empty heart.  Until one night...\n\nA couple friends tried this place out, one native San Diegan and he could not stop raving about this place.  Low and behold, I take a short trip down the Mission and found that golden pot at the end.  Only this time, there were no golden coins to be found, only an aluminum wrapped meal sent directly by a god and delivered via a Spanish man in a San Francisco hat. \n\nGive them a try after your rendezvous at SOM Bar or on your lunch break, they will not disappoint.\n\nFull disclosure: I've tried this place after a night out at a few bars, but also on a very sober Wednesday night.  Both worlds agree.", "author": "Justin I."}

Bee stings were cured with ice cream, a stomach flu with soup, car sickness with crackers, stitches required lollipops and after careful observation of my grandfather I realized that a hangover required grease. \n\nSo, when I am drunk and getting emo, or, conversely, at that point where if I do not eat some food I will be laid up for three days straight with one of those power hangovers I think about laughter being the best medicine, and try to fit that into the current situation, alongside greasy food. \n\nTaqueria Los Coyotes gives me a little of both. They have large greasy burritos that taste good, and pupusas, which are great when you are emo. Check off the grease box, you get it here. \n\nLaughter though? Well that comes when I walk across the street, already having eaten, and see all of the suckers waiting in line at Pancho Villa for what, in my opinion, is an inferior food product at a heftier price. \n\nDidn't their grandparents teach them anything?", "author": "Drue C."}

If we were looking to get food quickly, we probably would have done better to wait in line at Pancho Villa. This place takes their sweet time. Like 10-15 minutes for two burritos during a lull in traffic. Minus one star. \n\nI am an awesome dieter. I am such an awesome dieter that even drunk as a skunk, I'm looking to cut carbs. The nice girl at LC took my white-girl-on-eternal-low-carb-diet order requests seriously and made me a mostly lettuce and tomato burrito with just the slightest sprinkle of cheese, rice, and black beans plus some avocado.

Matt's chicken burrito was out of this world and disappeared in under 5 minutes. \n\nYou will wait. For what feels like forever. You will pay. $14.00 for a super veggie burrito and a chicken super burrito.  This is not so bad once you have indulged your drunken desires and stuffed your face with the wonders of Los Coyotes.

It's funny how very different it is to order at a slightly more dinner plate-oriented place than at a staple taqueria like Can Cun or Farolito. The staple places minimize their time-on-task. Los Coyotes seems to try to maximize their error/misunderstanding count per task.\n\nIt took about 20+ minutes to get our food, during which K-dawg texted me from his illegally parked car outside to say, \"I believe in you.\" Food arrived, we drove to our destination, and finally, eating it on the Yerba Buena lawn, I understood why I waited so long. The cheese was tasty and not overly greasy, the chile was tender, the re-fried beans sufficiently moist, and the entire ensemble generally authentic.

The first time I would have given this place 2 stars, possibly even 1, but after last night's visit, they deserve 3 stars for curbing my late night burrito longings.\n\nMy first visit was on a Thursday, a night they're not open too late (may 10 or 10:30ish) so I caught them while they were closing. I got a veggie taco and a quesadilla. I found a piece of beef floating in my veggie taco (not so bad for those who eat beef; very bad for those who don't). The quesadilla was just cheese, but they seemed to have forgotten to melt said cheese. I had gotten it to go, and actually re-fried the dry tortilla and crumbled mozzarella on my stove when I got home. Paying $5 for the parts to make a tortilla is really not what I had in mind.\n\nThat was my 2 (at best) star experience. Last night, however, they upped their game. Probably because it was a Saturday night and they stay open late to feed the drunken masses. I was hesitant, but I'm pretty new to the area and didn't want to search out a new place in heels, so in I went with 2 friends. I got the prawn burrito, which was hot all the way through. It was good, not particularly memorable, but it satisfied the craving. \n\nThe free salsa bar is pretty densely packed and if you like spicy, they've got some flavors to suit your taste. When the food is hot, it's pretty good, nothing to write home about, but worth the stop in if you're at the 16th & Mission Bart station on a Saturday night.", "author": "JessKate O."}

My torta was large and tasty, they didn't skimp on the breaded chicken breast, queso fresco and avocado.  At around $7 plus a drink and some free chips I was stuffed (and I'm a good eater!).\n3. They serve MICHELADAS. Micheladas remind me of Mexican resorts, they are sort of like Bloody Marys prepared with beer!  I know, nasty - but on a hot day I totally craved one. You get your choice of imported Mexican beer to add to your michelada. The spicy, salty, malty concoction always does the trick on a steaming day!   \n4.

I expected cold shrimp in cocktail sauce or ketchup (that is what makes it a \"Coctel\"in the Mexican context - if it comes without a sauce it is \"camarones al natural\". If it comes with lime juice, cilantro, avocado, onion....it would be more like a \"Ceviche de camarones\").  Their version of a cocktail had chopped cilantro, tomatoes, shrimp and onion swimming in a lot of WATER!

Before we did, we, of course, looked it up on yelp to make sure we were not wasting our time.  Yelp didn't fail us.  We really enjoyed the food and the cleaniliness of the place.  They also have a very clean and inviting salsa bar, served up with  complimentary blue corn tortilla chips and other types of tortilla chips.  We tried the California Burrito and a wet carne asada burrito.  Both very good.  Something about the crispy french fries in the California Burrito was so very addicting.  We tried to reduce the carb overload by ordering the whole wheat tortilla.  I am not sure if they make their own whole wheat tortillas but they are very tasty, compared to other places.

Because as soon as you do...Bam! Some little sleeper like this sneaks up on you and pops you right in the god damn forehead. Bastard! That hurts! And it humbles... I didn't go here for ever so long a time, even though it's waaay closer to my house than Taqueria Cancun, which I go to all the time. So I deserve whatever I get, which in this case, is not getting to eat delicious California burritos (burritos with steak, avocado, and french fries in them...yes, you heard right-burritos with frickin' french fries in them, people!), sometimes at two for one prices (continue reading) and honestly one of the best salsas I have ever had in my life (the spicy sweet mango salsa at the salsa bar-reason enough for going here). Not discovering this salsa hurts the most. Yes, I've had mango salsa before-I wasn't raised by wolves. But this ain't yer run of the mill tamed down Trader Joe's type mango salsa, either. This stuff is hot enough for a person like me, one who actually appreciates real fire in salsa, and this fire is also perfectly balanced by the sweetness of very, very fresh mangoes. Absolutely delicious and it's in the fresh salsa bar, among other salsas, all of which are pretty good as well, and while you're waiting for your food you can totally dip up as may of the little plastic drums as your fat little fingers can manage to, you big,fat, salsa pig. Then you can enjoy them at home on whatever you so choose (they won't know if you put the salsa on other foods besides theirs! Just keep it on the DL. Shh!) It took the Burrito deal that they run to finally get me in here to realize my folly. Well, I should say it took the burrito deal banner. They have a big plastic one outside draped up above, advertising \"the deal\" you see. The deal by the way, is buy any burrito and two drinks, and get a second burrito free-not bad. Now I have like a hundred cans of coke zero at my house too, because I can't drink the drinks fast enough. I think the deal is valid Mon-Wed 3-10pm. The service may be a little slower than some of the other places which are more well known, and therefore deal with a larger number of English speaking patrons on a regular basis, but that's why I'm writing this.

My only closest experience to this was trying out a Pupuseria somewhere around there, but I forget the name.  It seemed like this might have been a last resort in our search for food after DYL, but our guides seemed to knew where they were taking us for a late nite grub crawl.  We walked in and my first impression was that this place was going to satisfy.  Their setup is much like an open kitchen...everything's prepared right there.  A burrito was sounding really good at that point.  Make that a super burrito.  Ordered a carnitas super.  What?  They actually give you individual chips/salsa?  Excellent, although I wish it was more of a help yourself thing.  The chips/salsa hit the initial hunger pains with a left-right-left...damn that salsa was good.  The burrito though...that served the knockout.  That was the best burrito I had in a long time...actually, ever!  Not too dry, not too wet.  The carnitas was crispy with bits of fat to soften it up...just they way I like it. Topped with their salsa...soooooo gooooood!!!  Curious to try their tacos, but I'm not used to paying $2.25 for a taco...it better be good.  I'll be back!", "author": "JeFF T."}

The inside is big so you feel comfortable eating there unlike other taquerias, though they have very, very creepy decorative art. This is also the only taqueria that I've been to in the city that has carne asada fries.", "author": "Howie T."}

(btw thanks for my lovely oj    :)  )  because there's not enough staff running the place the customers  tend to cluster at the counter so they can hear their order being called over the waaaay-too-loud music.\n\nmy two carne asada tacos were tasty, and the salsa bar was well maintained and fresh. i liked the fresh salsa the most. . . .spicy goodness.", "author": "Amber A."}
