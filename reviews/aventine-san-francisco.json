I should mention, that this review will not be covering any of the food offerings, as I have never ordered anything other than drinks here. Honestly I didn't even know that they had food until I read the other reviews. Whoops!\n\nAnyway, this is such a good spot to grab a few drinks after work. An absolute favorite of mine. While it can be difficult to get seating unless you arrive early, standing is usually not much of an issue. The happy hour here is great, with a decent selection of beers included, and cocktails right around $10 or so, which is not bad given the location. I also find the selection of beers to be more than satisfactory, and usually inclusive of some Bay Area favorites, such as Drakes and Fieldwork.\n\nSorry I can't speak to the quality of the food. But if you are coming here for the drinks you will not be disappointed. They have absinth, which is an absolute treat to both be served and then eventually drink, in addition to all of the wonderful offerings above. So if you weren't sold before, hopefully you are now!", "author": "Kevin B."}

The restaurant itself was relatively empty and a little bit dark. I ordered the margarita pizza, I love pizza and I didn't love their pizza. I didn't even remotely liked it. The pizza was overcooked on the the top and undercooked on the bottom. I have flour all over my black pants because I made the mistake of ordering to go. The dough was also not completely cooked through, if you enjoy the taste of raw flour and dough then this is your pizza. There was no flavor to their pizza even if it was properly cooked, and it was oily. You'll be better off warming up boxed pizza. Completely unacceptable to serve subpar pizza at an ITALIAN restaurant, maybe it's Italian only by name. I don't recommend this place until they learn how to make a decent pizza.", "author": "Maria N."}

Looking through the window it looked like a cozy place to dine with reasonably priced food.\n\nLooking at some of the other reviews and photos, I decided to stay away from the pizza and go for a sandwich. \n\nThe grilled cheese is delicious paired with a jam and apples. My only knock on this was the menu said Granny Smith apples and mine came with red delicious. It still tasted great but if you're picky with your apples maybe double check before ordering. I paired mine with the side salad. As someone who prefers my salad with just lettuce and dressing, this was perfect. The dressing was lite yet flavorful and a little citrusy.\n\nThe popcorn was outstanding. It's enough to feed more than a couple people. There was enough cheese on it that even as you ate past the first layer, the popcorn underneath still had some on it. You could tell it was made fresh too as the waiter said it'd take about 15 minutes to prepare.\n\nThere was one waiter at lunch when I was there.

If it's an Indian Summer in San Francisco or the temperature is above the 60's degree, choose outdoor seating because it is soso nice and relaxing. Although there can be disruptions like cars honking or the nearby fire truck speeding by, the view of The Transamerica Pyramid seals the deal. \n\n-As an inexperienced drinker, I was unsure exactly what to order. The server was nice enough to wish me a Happy Belated Birthday, while also offering possible suggestions for me. I decided to order the Dutch Courage-Genever, Lemon Juice, Rosemary, Raspberry, Ginger Beer. I didn't want anything too strong, but I also didn't want to be the one sipping on Capri Sun.

I had just purchased my first lunch off of MealPal and this place was the closest to my work. Was definitely surprised when I walked into this place as I was expecting a restaurant. It was most certainly not a restaurant and very much a bar. As I approached the bartender, she gave me a weird look as if she were thinking that I'm not old enough to be in a bar. I came in and told the bartender I was picking up my lunch off mealpal. She asked for my name and handed me my order. \n\nI had the pizza topped with prosciutto and arugula. The crust was very thin. I was expecting it to be more of a thick crust from the picture they used for advertising. The bottom of the box was also quite greasy. Overall, it tasted alright. They weren't too generous with the amount of prosciutto but it wasn't a stingy amount either. the dough itself wasn't too bad. Since it was thin, it had a nice crunch on the outside and was still soft on the inside. I just wished that it wasn't so greasy as that was sort of a turn off to see. Perhaps coming into a bar for food was not the best idea. Will be back during their happy hour as they do have some pretty good deals.", "author": "Cynthia T."}

I always thought it was a cool place. We've been coming here a lot more in recent months since I started working nearby. \n\nThen, some strange things started happening.\n\nSeveral months ago, I went to Happy Hour there to order a Happy Hour drink. There was an $8 Old Grand Dad which I ordered on the rocks. The bill came out and the drink was $10 and I asked why. She said it was because I ordered it on the rocks and they pour you a little more than without. Weird since I've seen other places charge you more for neat since they claim to pour you more there. Whatever, it's $2.\n\nFast forward to last week. I ordered the same thing but this time neat. Again, I was charged $10 and she said it was because I ordered it neat. I was thoroughly confused now and reminded her that I was charged $10 for the opposite the last time. This time, she said that On the Rocks OR Neat are both extra $2! And what I should have ordered to get the Happy Hour price is a SHOT. \n\nReally? I have to say a shot? Me pointing to the Old Grand Dad on the happy hour menu wasn't sufficient? Or asking for the happy hour Old Grand Dad? If you're going to charge me for more, how about a heads up.\n\nTo add insult to injury, someone in our party had ordered 3 Whistle Pigs and was charged $30 each! Laphroaig 10 Year was $16! Whistle Pig is $18 at Local Edition and Barbarossa has Laphroaig for $12-13 I believe. Come on now, seriously?

I was here well over five years ago for a Yelp Elite event when it first opened and remembered the bar bites to be quite tasty. Actually I don't have to remember since I reviewed that event in my usual painstaking detail (review: http://bit.ly/1fuV9z7). I returned because I was having one of those days at work where I just had to leave the office for a bit to avoid a moment of career-threatening drama. As I meandered on the edge of the FiDi talking to myself like Cate Blanchett throughout \"Blue Jasmine\", I came upon Taverna Aventine and secured a high-top table to myself.\n\nAmong the several choices on the menu, I settled on the $14 Tuscan Steak Tramezzino, a buttery steak sandwich on a pretzel hoagie slathered with Gorgonzola aioli and truffle honey (photo: http://bit.ly/MRWaGS). With the addition of arugula, it made for a peppery-savory-sweet confection that was quite a treat for lunch. Instead of fries on the side, they provided a small mixed green salad and some vegetable chips which would have been my preference anyway (photo: http://bit.ly/1e8nYkY). The rest of the lunch menu sounds like solid selections for office drones like myself who are willing to spend a few more dollars to avoid a Lee's Deli run (literally) -  small pizzas, salumi, antipasti, even sliders. Perhaps I should meander over to these parts more often and not just as an escape route.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...one of the better steak sandwiches to be had in the FiDi\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...an unusually low-key bar setting during the lunch hour (photo: http://bit.ly/1js6oZV)\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...serviceable enough\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Rome wasn't built in a day but I think that steak sandwich would have given hope to the empire", "author": "Ed U."}

Overall, this is a nice place to drink that balances being hipster enough by serving interesting cocktails with premium ingredients without the huge prices that might be associated. Cocktails are $9 during happy  hour and, I think, $11 the rest of the time. Service is good and the noise level is high. Not a huge find but, for a hip-enough bar in downtown SF with pretty good drinks, Taverna Aventine is a good choice.", "author": "Eli L."}

The private room was pretty cool, it has its own bar and the exposed brick wall is actually the original 1849 seawall. Definitely has a bit of the hideout feel to it, which suits its location in the old SF Barbary Coast. \n\nWhile we chatted and enjoyed our libations, we snacked on chicken skewers, beef sliders (the meat was so good, I swore I tasted some lamb mixed in), olive and mushroom tapenade, and crab salad over cucumber. From looking at the menu on menupage, except for the sliders, I'm not sure if the catering for our private event is part of their every day offering. I highly recommend the sliders and the mushroom tapenade was also very good. I didn't get to try it, but every time a waiter walked by carrying truffle infused popcorn for upstairs, the aroma was positively intoxicating! \n\nWe headed upstairs to watch the conclusion of the Broncos and Chiefs game. It's nice that a yuppy-ish place like this has a few TVs hanging above the bar. The crowd was decidedly fidi, with many in suits. I suspect that it might be a bit of a meat/meet market. I really loved the lively atmosphere and can't wait to go back for happy hour and some of that truffle popcorn!", "author": "Alice W."}

The first was an alumni mixer between two schools (with about 40 people), and we used the Library Room (free of charge) while other patrons were there. The second was a much larger event--180ish people--and we rented the entire place.\n\nBefore reaching out to Aventine about hosting our event there, I contacted about 5 or 6 other places (mostly art galleries). Many took days to return my phone calls and email, or never responded at all. Michelle, the manager, had a response to me within a few hours, and I really appreciated that. \n\nThe manager is awesome and answered all my questions promptly. I changed our head count numerous times, including the day of the party, and she was able to accommodate all my requests and calm me down when I was freaking out about last minute details. \n\nThe night of the party, the staff was really friendly and professional and I had SO many people come up to me, telling me how great the event was, how much they liked the bar, etc. \n\nAlthough I didn't get to drink much, the drinks I had (vodka gimlets) were exactly how I like them, and it didn't take me long at all to get the attention of the bartender. \n\nOverall, a really good experience and I'd definitely use them again for future events.", "author": "Marcella D."}

I hope this perspective leads the owners to deal with the situation. \n\n1.  group gathered by the bar.  other group by the tables.  people circulating between the two.  natural behavior in a bar.  \n\n2.  group of folks joins us from outside tables.\n\n3.  waitress trying to pass through, without asking excuse first in a polite voice, yells in a shrill voice, very rude.  \"move!!!!!\"  her behavior continues each time she passes through, 4 - 5 times.  all in the shrill voice, never a reasonable request.  \"hey, buddy\", \"out of my way!!!\" so loud, shrill and out of line that everyone is commenting.  it is noted that all of us have been to other establishments where the passage situation is also delicate, and the staff manages to handle it in a more constructive, hospitable way.  \n\n4.  it is also noted that this waitress was extremely impatient with the guests when taking their orders outside.  to the extent that people said, \"who is the customer here?\"\n\n5.  annoyed at being yelled at by the staff for an innocent situation, i spoke to the bartender who identified himself as the night's manager.  i said, \"you should know about this.  it is a problem.  everyone is talking about it.  i understand this is a difficult situation, but her behavior is out of line.\"\n\n6.  the manager is completely unsympathetic.  not respecting my opinion at all, the manager says, \"yeah, well it is a tough job.\"\n\n7.  the next time the waitress passes through she spills a drink on my friend.  after spilling the drink on my friend, instead of apologizing, she laughs, as if my friend deserved it.  with no apology, or acknowledgement that this is an awkward situation, the waitress walks off. \n\n8.  ten minutes later, the same co-manager to whom i had spoken earlier and another co-manager come by our group.  they confront my friend in a very accusatory manner and say, \"our staff is downstairs crying.  what did you do to her?\"  interesting way to bring up an issue with a customer.  when my friend says, \"i didn't do anything\" (which is true), the new co-manager says \"now i have heard her version, i just want to hear your version of the story.\"  having already brought the waitress' attitude problem up with the other co-manager, thinking that would have tipped him off that maybe his staff isn't always right, i stood up for my friend.  i again said that the waitress was out of line and that they should do something about it. \n\n9.  situation seems to calm down.  crowd thins.  i am now standing by the tables.  \n\n10.  ten minutes later, first co-manager to whom i had originally spoken approaches me.  i think perhaps he is coming to apologize for the confusion.\n\n11.  instead, he says, \"i'm sorry but we will no longer serve you or anyone in your group here.  you have been cut off.  i need to stand by my server.\"\n\n12.  when i say that is a very odd way to handle a situation, the co-manager says, \"i'm sorry but i don't have time to deal with this situation now.  you can come back monday and discuss this.\"  he then walks off.\n\nis this the standard of hospitality i should expect from aventine?  is the market for waitstaff so tight in san francisco that we should all put up with being pushed around and accused by staff?  is management of aventine so difficult, so stretched that constructive comments to management are not respected?  \n\nmy experience at other bars, restaurants, and music venues is very different.  is this just a fact of life when i want to go to aventine on a friday night?\n\nnote to owners, the attitude and response i got from your staff was way out of line, unsympathetic, and disrespectful-- remarkably bad.", "author": "Katherine C."}

We were able to do a bulk of our planning via email, but when I needed to stop by in person a few times, Michelle always made herself available, so that she could answer my questions. She provided a great proposal that fit within my budget. She was helpful in the meal planning, ensuring that we had a diverse offering that was also sensitive to dietary restrictions. The food is delicious! The wild mushroom & truffle cream bruschetta was one of my favorites. During our event, appetizers were offered at the bar and also served by wait staff throughout the venue. I would also like to say thank you to our main server Darianne and to our bartender Daniel for taking such good care of everyone throughout the event. Michelle also was there, checked in with me regularly throughout the party and also tended to our guests. We also had a doorman manage a guest list and ensure that the general public did not come in. It was rock star service all around!  \n\nTaverna offers the flexibility to open up space or keep the existing tables and chairs and also offer DJ equipment, as well as the option to play personal play lists or pipe in Pandora. We were able to set up a photo booth and project the pictures onto their TV screens. This was a big hit for my team and will make it one of our most memorable parties in 2013. \n\nWe booked the main parlor upstairs. This is a great space for intimate gatherings of 90 or less.

Outside is clean with a pleasant little alley down the side. Since I go to lunch at one there was only two other people in the bar which made service rather good. I sat at the bar and ordered a Jack and Coke (that was a little light on the Jack) while I reviewed the delicious looking menu.\n\nI ordered the Tuscan Steak sandwich that comes with a little salad and potatoes chips on the side. I was looking forward to the chips as they were not your everyday average Ruffles but they tasted so stale I didn't eat them. The salad was fine and the steak was soft and juicy but the bread was so hard that I couldn't eat it. Don't get me wrong, I like hard crunchy toasted bread. Even over toasted and a little burnt and crunchy is perfered but this was uneatable. After my warm steak slices I had a shot of Fernet-Branca to wash it all down.\n\nI won't be back anytime soon for fear of rocks posing as bread may be used again. Maybe its better after dark.\n\nTotal disappointment: $32.00.", "author": "Justin S."}

Of course, a few tips we're in order as he continually provided quick service to my coworkers and me.\n\nThere was limited seating in the basement, but I still had a great time just standing and talking with my Lagunitas IPA in hand.

Despite the crowd being limited to a few occupied tables of two, and several singles at the bar, the waitress seemed flustered and took a bit of time getting to our table for drink orders. She turned out to be very sweet however, and I got the overall impression that the staff is friendly and treats its customers well.\n\nI had the Tuscan Steak Sandwich, and it was good enough. I was expecting the hoagie to taste a bit more like a pretzel (given the description) and was disappointed it didn't have the same softness and saltiness of an actual pretzel. But the steak itself was tender and the Gorgonzola aoli was delicious. It overpowered the truffle honey, however, and I even expected they forgot to put that on all together. \n\nMy friend got a soup and salad combo. He didn't say anything exceptional about it, but he finished half if not most. He had 2 glasses of wine and I had 2 beers, and with tip we spent $30 each. Not bad at all.

It's a tomato and burrata sandwich. \n\nDrinks: If you're thinking 11:30 on a work day is too early to start drinking alcohol and you want perhaps a cup of coffee to go with your meal on this cold San Francisco day, THINK AGAIN.

My lunch experience today teeters between 3 and 4 stars - it's a new spot, so they are receiving benefit of the doubt that the kinks of today will be worked out.\n\nThe space is quite beautiful, nicely decorated - a bit Fish and Farm, a touch of Alembic and a dash of Bourbon and Branch.  The dining chairs are large and wooden.  As an average height woman, I felt swallowed by the chairs and my butt hurt after 10 minutes, but they look cool, so I guess that counts for a lot.  The space is also a bit loud, construction noises excepted.  When I send people out on business lunches, they like places on the quieter side, so we'll need to investigate that a bit more.  The music selection was fantastic though.\n\nOn to the food...\n\nTwo of us ordered the beet salad.  It was delish - had a sweet flavor - cinnamon, cardamom, something.  More beets - that's my usual request and it held true here.  The ricotta salata was divine.  The Caesar salad looked yummy and totally authentic with those little anchovies hanging on to the romaine.  \n\nI had the Tonato sandwich.  The appearance was a bit \"eh\", but the taste was fantastic!  It's an open-faced sandwich and my thought is that open-faced equals pretty (like you reveal the inside to show off the beautiful contents).  Unfortunately, cooked tuna, artichoke, green olives and prosciutto don't have the most attractive color palate.  But, again, the flavors were a hit!  It was savory and the bread a bit sweet....mmmmm.  The side salad it came with was also very good - loved the celery seeds in the dressing and maybe just a bit too salty.  \n\nOne friend had the grilled cheese, which was thoroughly enjoyed.  The other had the tuna tartar (awesome - loved the basil in it) and the calamari (again really well-seasoned and nicely presented).  \n\nThe service was a bit slow.  It was their FIRST service so it's totally understandable, but I thought the staff had a lot of chatter and pointing going on, trying to sort it all out and I know we're \"friends and family\", but please don't point at me - it makes me feel weird.  It's just something to note that during FiDi lunch hours, people really need smooth, consistent and well paced service.  I'm certain all of that will be great when they are officially open for business.\n\nWell done Aventine - I'm looking forward to many more lunches and drinks with you.  I've got my coin collection started....", "author": "Mac M."}

I don't know what it is about the crowd; we are girls of 5ft couple inches height and in our early 20's, and for some reason I just felt out of place. We still hung around and enjoyed some 1/2 off drinks. \n\nSo HH is only 1/2 off on well drinks and wine - having not been informed of that I ordered a cocktail, it was called \"The Nichol\" being a Nicole I \"had to get it\" it but it was $10, rip off especially since they only fill your cup 1/2 way up with the drink. Lame. \n\nYelpers keep mentioning the downstairs, but the evening we went it was closed, there isn't much seating only a couple individual sized couches by the window so most everyone stands.

Common sense, y'all. \n\nI can agree that there needed to be more bartenders working that night for what the establishment had to assume was a large opening crowd. Less bartenders that night meant they all got stressed out more easily, and were grumpier as the night went on, but hey, that's the typical human reaction when people don't ask for their order nicely. The 'tenders did a fine job considering what they had to work with.\n\nGot hit on by plenty of people, which was fun, it was a very warm day, so I cracked up when more than one person elected to open with the line \"it's really hot in here, huh?\" \"Yes, hot guy, it is.\"\n\nSo, back to the party. I was allowed to bring glass outside, and didn't have any plastic cup issues that others mentioned.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-04-14", "description": "One of the problems of having a booze-free lunch is that I am far less predisposed to reflect kindly on the experience afterwards. While it is not the fault of the establishment (as long as they serve booze), I also have to say that I think it heightens my critical faculties and thus renders a more honest and subjective assessment. \n\nThat said, I thought Aventine was O.K., had some flaws that still bug me, but, it is a place I would definitely give another try. \n\nDecor: Awesome! I totally dig the super-architectual wall paper, the bare wood, the minimalist yet creative fixtures and the space. \n\nSeating: I loathe stools, and most of the seating, at least upstairs, is on stools. Bleh! Also, there is nowhere to put your coat or bag except balled on the floor. \n\nService: Weird. The woman was not rude but not friendly. Seemed to have a touch of attitude. Order was mixed up and took quite a while. The waiter checked in to tell us our salads were coming up, but, was not particularly sorry about the long wait. \n\nFood: Oh boy, tuna tartare! Why, you NEVER see tuna tar-fucking-tare on the menu these days, do you? Let's order that! Honestly, it was good tuna tartare, and they seem to have toast down, but, jeez, not very interesting. \n\nCaesar salad, that was another \"novelty\" on the menu. At least they threatened to put actual anchovies on the salad, which, while not technically correct, is a bold move. But, since both my dining companions asked for no anchovy, my requested anchovies were also missing. Yet it took so long to get the salad, I did not make a fuss about the lack of actual anchovy on my salad. \n\nThe salad greens were super-crunchy and cold, so, that was a big plus, but, the dressing was mouth-searingly garlicky. I have to say it was over-garlicky. It was almost pleasant in it's amazing strength, but, ultimately, was overdone. It is four days later and I STILL have the sense-memory of super-strong garlick in my mouth.  I suppose it would not have mattered if I had gotten the anchovies - I am sure I would not have been able to taste them. \n\nGlasses: Everything seemed to be served in mason jars. I like mason jars but for some reason I hated that everything (well, water and iced tea) was in mason jars. I suppose if we ordered wine it would have been in something different, but, like I said, this was a no-alcohol excursion and we did not find out. \n\nPatrons: Definitely a lot of entitled ladies and douchebags dined here during lunch on Good Friday, I can only imagine what a week-night happy hour is like here. \n\nLike I said, I probably need a few drinks and I would be more of a fan.

I came here today for the first time with some friends for happy hour. It was definitely a happy time! When we got there it wasn't too crowded. The place and the atmosphere is great. Little touches here and there like a pretty little flower on the table add a classic feel to this place. Not trendy (at least not to me) at all and just a place to relax, drink and hangout. We ordered the truffle popcorn and the platter of appetizers (crackers, fruit, pickled things, cheese, and nuts). This was a perfect snack and good to feed three people. We were full by the end.

I rented the downstairs of Taverna Aventine recently. \n\nLikes: Great bartender \"James\". Super nice guy, very easy to work with. Atmosphere was good. \n\nDislikes: Management is difficult to work with. The food was nowhere near as good as what they present in the restaurant. You pay a lot more and get a lot less and the presentation is definitely not as nice. Do not purchase the cheese platter unless you get in writing exactly what they are going to do. We expected something nice for the cost and while it was good cheese, it was all shoved on a small platter with no toothpicks or garnishes and only a small amount of plain wheat crackers were provided no nearly enough for the amount of cheese provided. Also the sliders came plain - with just meat and bread - no garnishes at all. Overall execution on food was REALLY REALLY BAD. Maybe the usual chef was sick that day? I have put on many events and this was by far the worst presentation of food from what I would consider a good to upper-end establishment. Warm food was all made well ahead of time as well and was cold and utensils and plates were not provided as agreed. Don't trust what you're told or get in writing - management is not honest. When we asked about a refund for poor execution and spending well over $3000 at the venue. We were basically told \"too bad\". I'm an easy going guy that only expects what is contractually agreed to. This company does not honor commitments to customers. Watch out. I'm giving them a [1] for not taking responsibility and ownership of the poor service my group received.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-15", "description": "Writing a review about lunch at Aventine, and I can tell you it did not live up to expectations.  My friend and I ordered potato garlic soup, Lardon and Frisee salad, pastured beef sliders, and Tuscan Steak Salad.  The soup was decent, fairly smooth, but not much potato consistency and flovrs were bland.  The soup was served with a few slices of toasted bread.  The Lardon and Frisee salad was very dissappointing.  The salad had no frisee, the lardons were just bacon slices, and the poached egg was leaking.  To make matters worse, the dressing was tasteless.  I am a big fan of this classic french salad that brings together contrasting ingredients and combines them in a tantalizing way.  This salad did not do justice to the real thing.  The beef sliders used the wrong bread, instead of mini rolls, they used baggettes sections which were very tough to chew, and made eating the burger a chore.  The beef was under seasoned and not very flavorful.  the burger looked nothing like the picture on the restaurant's website.  Also a very dissappointing dish.  Finally, the Tuscan Steak sandwich.   The beef was mediocre, seemed more like a skirt steak for a fajita than anything resembling Italian.  The parmesan (semi-melted) and the arugula (completely wilted) were present as expected, and the truffle oil added a little sophistication.  This was an okay/mediocre offering, and certainly better than the beef slider.  Overall, this venue has good ambiance and vibe.  Maybe I caught them on an off day or maybe the lunch menu isn't prepared by the night chef, but I was really expecting a lot more.  I pass by frequenlty and have wondered whether it would good.  The happy hour scene is probably a better reason to come, but I wouldn't go there again for the food.", "author": "Ronald W."}

I had a champagne cocktail that was delish. The bartender/server was very friendly, but we were disappointed that they didn't have much in the way of happy hour. The food came in very small portions and wasn't veggie friendly. Overall, rather pricey but a nice place to sit with the gals.", "author": "Tamara M."}

Downstairs kind of feels like a dungeon but I think that's what their going for. I recommend going with some friends to chill out or a mid-week happy hour spot. I went on  a Saturday night and the place was empty aside from our crowd. I think in general the Fidi kind of closes down on weekends.", "author": "christina C."}

It's approximately a ten minute walk from either Montgomery or Embarcadero BART stations, and is close to some dining options along Columbus Ave, making it a good pre-dinner stop. At first glance, it appears to be a small space, but there is a full length lower level. It was packed with people, but the lower level was less crowded than the main level. The crowd was mostly young professionals, with a sprinkling of middle aged people here and there. They did have a live DJ there, playing a variety of modern tunes, and some classical pop hits, but I found the music to be a bit too loud. That night, a friend asked of my opinion of the place, and my exact response was, \"I'd like it even more if the music weren't so loud\". There was a happy hour drink menu, with a few interesting sounding concoctions, though I went for a glass of wine. Though the price for a glass of wine wasn't a spectacular happy hour deal, the pour was a very generous one. Apparently, they are open as a restaurant during lunch time hours, so I may swing by one day to check that out. It's worth checking out, just be prepared for loud music.", "author": "Damon Z."}

They've got a good group of people working there who make you feel right at home.  The quality of food and wine on the menu are top notch.   The Vintage guys really know how to run a bar/restaurant.", "author": "Fred X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-24", "description": "Financial District needed a new happy hour bar, and this one is a beauty in its interior and location.  The clientele is sometimes dressed as if they are on a sex and the city episode, and are trying very hard to be young, hip, urban and successful, and as a result this place isn't very relaxing.  One can get the same mixed drink a few blocks away for half the price but you don't come here for bargains.  The place is extremely packed with the after-work crowd on Thursday nights, but other nights and weekends can be a little too quiet.  \n\nGreat location and attractive bar and setting.  Come here when you are dressed to kill and want to flaunt your assets.", "author": "Firecracker P."}

Early, around 6, but upstairs was still relatively full. This is a classic financial district bar. A little too swanky for my taste, and the food, while good, was small. This place is ok, just nothing amazing.", "author": "Rachel H."}

It would've been really nice to have everybody go in and get a drink. However... I didn't even make it pass the front door. First time a doorman, or ANYONE, ever tells me my driver license is fake. Ridiculous. Completely unheard of and unreal. Not even a complement that I looked young for my age (23) or of the sort. Even more ridiculous is that the doorman accused my friends' drivers licenses of also being fakes and denied entry. I thought he was kidding and joked to him saying that I bought my 'fake' ID from a guy called the DMV... but he didn't get it. Not worth the aggravation from his simple mindedness. No blacklight, no swipe of my ID, no proof my ID or others were fake. Didn't even apologize for his actions. And he was rude and tried to make me feel stupid. I didn't take a Norcal trip just to get hassled by some guy who can't tell the difference between a real ID and another real ID. Too bad Aventine, you just lost 15 customers who wanted to drink.", "author": "Andrew K."}

I am reviewing only on my experience last night for the grand opening party.  So, when you introduce your place to the world, one would think you would try extra hard to make a great impression, right??  Don't get me wrong, I am a huge fan of the Vintage 415 eateries, so I was super stoked to hear about checking this place out.  My friend and I rsvp'd with glee to the event.  We showed up and the place was packed with financial district happy hour goers and the usual Johnny Marina and Jane Marina's of the world.  We make our way to the bar, which was tended by three.  To our excitement we get right up to the bar in front of the bartender.  She is doing her rounds of helping people out.  So, when my turn rolls around, some stupid chic jumps up in front of me and orders her drinks.  Ok, that's fine.  I will be next.  Oh, no.  The bartender continues to serve everyone else around me and my friend for at least three other rounds.  Stupid, inconsiderate people abound at this place and don't have the courtesy to say, \"they were here before me, so please serve them next.\" I mean, c'mon people, step outside of your special \"me me\" world and realize others do exist.  The bartender even smiled at me twice, so I figured I would get a drink eventually.  About thirty minutes later after being ignored, even though raising my hand, a kind gentleman finally let us order before him.  Finally a drink!  Well, a luke warm corona was what I got and I couldn't even get the bartenders attention to get a plastic cup and god forbid a lime for my drink.  We make our way out but unfortunately can't get out of the scorching restaurant to join the block party ensuing outside because we have glass bottles.  SHOCKER. We did enjoy our time inside watching people make fools of themselves.  We finally make our way outside and a nice cocktail waitress asks us right away if we would like a drink.  Why, yes, another Corona please!  She returns with two corona's in bottles outside and we please ask for two cups so that we don't get yelled at by the bouncer again.  Oh and by the way, the cocktail waitress had no idea what beers they served.  We wanted a Stella which she said they didn't have but apparently they did (if you work at the place, shouldn't you know what beers you have??).  So, another warm corona that fizzes up so much because of the warmth.  Chic never returns with limes and cups and big bouncer heads our way.  He totally gets in our face and pumps his already large 300lb body at us.  The two of us at five foot nothing don't even come close to adding up to his weight.  He was a total ass and didn't seem to care about the multiple groups of guys around us with their glass bottles.  So, back we go inside.  We finally bolt because we are so disgusted.  C'mon now!  First off, when you want to impress your customers hire staff who know what you serve and how to provide good customer service. I will give the place one more try for the food but at this point I am very disappointed in Aventine.  I don't like to give bad reviews but I want to alert these guys that they really need to improve on their customer service.  Hey, if you took the time to read this ranting review, more power to you!", "author": "Carolyn D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-19", "description": "Hey Ladies and Gents, Vintage 415 has opened another cool place in the financial district, hooray! Well, much to my chagrin I am not sure I'll be back to this establishment. I'm all for people watching, dancing in a crowd, enjoying the excitement of a new bar with fashion forward San Franciscans, but not this past Friday night. I completely understand rules and waiting in line, but come on... when you're ignored by the bartender who attends to the ill mannered who shout out their drink orders after you've awaited your turn, it makes a girl a little crazy. Not to mention the fact that she did not even offer a plastic cup so that we could have had the option to go outside and enjoy the festivities. Immediately after being served, she turned away and there was no way we were getting her attention for the rest of the night. So the doorman then proceeds to enforce the rules and not allow us to go out without a plastic cup. Fair enough, we finish our libations and then go outside to enjoy the merrymakers. Yay, a cocktail waitress quickly arrives and takes our drink orders. Oh, the night started a little rocky, but it is improving. Well, not so quickly. We order our drinks and she returns with glass bottles. Okay, she says she will return with the plastic cups so we can stay outside. Well, the doorman makes a B line for us and seriously tries to rough us up, not cool dude. He was a complete jerk, only to be too much of a wimp to enforce his rules to all the guys around holding glass containers. Okay, I'm not impressed, and completely disappointed. I will still enjoy dancing to DJ AM and enjoying a Big Dog now and again, but Taverna Aventine is lacking the sparkle that most of Vintage 415 venues tend to excel in.", "author": "B K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-10-22", "description": "This is place okay.  Nice decor and ambiance - they did a good job with the place.  The service however was very frustrating last Friday at one of their openings.  It seemed as though they didn't take into account that it was an opening as they had three people (you would think that would be sufficient)  working the inside bar but in actuality, they really weren't working - they were just chatting it up amongst themselves or with patrons.  The female bartender would only serve males which was pretty lame and it seemed like the concept of having to work and serve a crowded bar was foreign.  Considering we're in a recession and times are difficult for some, a lot of people aren't going out as much and they will be inclined to take their business elsewhere if service isn't up to par.  Sucks but true.  I'd be willing to give this place the benefit of the doubt considering it was an opening when I went so hopefully this was a one time \"hiccup\" on their part.", "author": "Danielle V."}
