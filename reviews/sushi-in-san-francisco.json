I've dined inside Sushi In once before, so I figured after this delivery it was time to write a quick review. \n\nLook. The sushi is good, it's not mind bending by any means but, like my other \"casual\" sushi restaurant reviews it's important to remember that casual sushi spots exist for one main reason, a cheap sushi fix. \n\nI ordered a few of the standard \"filler\" rolls like the spicy tuna, kappa maki, tekka maki, etc. which were all pretty good. The maguro was super fresh and enjoyed it very much. I also ordered a couple rolls with Hamachi (Yellow Tail) and the fish was a bit tougher in texture that I'm normally used to, but passable for sure. \n\nFor an affordable Tuesday night Eat 24 delivery option, you can't go wrong.", "author": "Benjamin F."}

The fish was sub-par (the \"yellowtail\" looked like frozen, bleached tuna, frosty pink coloured with no veining and an unrecognisable flavour to match), as I suppose would be expected from such a special, but we went on to order a few items from the regular menu and were driven even further from impressed.\n\nHopefully someone who reads this review will save themselves some saliva by AT LEAST avoiding their beef tataki. Absolutely w a s t e d m o n e y. It was not only overcooked, tough, and over salted, but the meat had that weird metallic sheen on it from when beef gets days old (somehow it was able to appear to have a red patch in the middle, but it tasted like crusty sundried leather). We ate only one piece each, left the rest til the end, and then were pushing each other to consume the remaining pieces since no one had any desire for more yet we couldn't stand to waste the money. I've never had such difficulty eating at a sushi restaurant, and to be clear I have no problem eating low budget if it's not terrible. This was actually regrettable.\n\nTo be fair, the pictures I'm seeing on yelp are extremely different from what we received from sushi In, and I would hope that we just hit them on an off day. I came because of the pictures, and I feel like I still have no idea what restaurant must have produced them. I'm willing to believe that they have other chefs and products available at other times. However, I still remember the taste of that ratty beef as I walked out the door, and it is not an experience I'd ever be keen to repeat.", "author": "Alice L."}

P.S. for REAL Sushi Eaters\n\nI have been going to Sushi-In 1-2 times per week for the last 2 years and this is why:\n1. Some of the best uni in town - the pieces are huge, super fresh and Sushi-In is the only restaurant in town carrying the \"Gold\" quality Mendocino Uni (at the moment). \n2. Highest Quality Sushi Happy Hour in Town (M-F 4:30-6pm)! GIANT hand rolls for $3, large pieces of FRESH Hamachi for $2 ea, $4 large hot sake ( I know.... I prefer cold too, but it's $4). \n3. VERY FRESH- They receive seafood shipments everyday so the quality is consistently excellent. \n4. Fabulous staff who LOVES children (I don't see children there often, but they have hello kitty cups ready) - My 5 year old daughter's favorite place to go. \n\nWhile the selection is not as interesting as Kappa, Kabuto or Zushi Puzzle, what they do have is consistently fabulous and much less expensive (just as good and sometimes better).  \n\nYesterday I ordered Uni, O-Toro and some happy hour Nigiri with my daughter (who eats as much as me). We walked out the door with a $32 bill.  Nowhere in San Francisco serves up this quality for this price! \n\nThat said, if you are looking for a marina scene or you like low quality rolls you are likely to be disappointed.  Because Sushi-in carries such high quality seafood, the rolls are more expensive relative to other places in the area that stuff their rolls with less fresh seafood.  If you can't tell the difference, save your money and go somewhere else.  Perhaps Ace?", "author": "Megan M."}

However, for $16 a pop, I'm going to need a bigger portion.  Same goes for Boyfriend's chirashi, which was an $18 small bowl of rice and about 4 kinds of fish, plus a small piece of octopus and shrimp.\n\nSushi IN is clearly a sushi-only place, as their hot food items were very, very limited (teriyaki chicken, a few other broiled fish dishes); they didn't even have any noodle dishes, which is really what I'd been looking for on a cold drizzly evening.\n\nThis place is small but not cozy.

This is definitely more of a sushi place (than general Japanese food) - they only had a few non-sushi items on the list, which was fine by me as I'm a fan of sushi. One of my friends ordered the teriyaki chicken and she seemed to be happy with it. The rest of us ordered 4 rolls to share: Mango Madness, Beef Tataki, TKO, and... one other I can't remember the name of.

The first thing my wife and I both noticed was the great taste of the house sake. It was fresh and flavorful. We decided to abandon (most) of our favorites and try some new menu items. We shared everything. \n\nWe did order two of our favorite Japanese staples. The gyoza was perfectly browned on the two sides. The filling was nicely seasoned and juicy, and the dipping sauce was lighter and milder than most Japanese restaurants. We found the Kaiso (seaweed salad) very refreshing and particularly crunchy. As I mentioned in my first review , the seaweed salad here omits the red pepper flakes, but is quite refreshing and tasty without the heat. \n\nMy wife wanted to try the Beef Tataki Roll. We have had lots of sushi in San Francisco since we moved here in 1976, but never had a maki without any fish in it. The overall taste of this roll was like heaven. The whole thing just melted in your mouth. However, the beef flavor was overwhelmed by the pineapple on top - a thinner slice of pineapple would have improved the balance, even though we gobbled it up. My wife also had a Shrimp Tempura roll which she said was the best she ever ate. The shrimp was very fresh and still crunchy inside the roll. We mentioned this to our hostess and she said that was because the tempura shrimp was made fresh for each order, not pre-fried and sitting around. \n\nI ordered a Chestnut Roll which I enjoyed very much. The tobiko topping was super fresh and just the right amount.  I wished I could taste the scallions, but could not. I also tried their signature Mango Madness, served last (for dessert?). In fact, it was very much a fruity sushi dessert, sweet, but very fruity and well-balanced flavors. \n\nI'd like to add that all these goodies were extremely well plated with lots of eye appeal, which whets the appetite and lends to their appreciation.  Very well done and appreciate by us for sure.  We'll be back again soon.", "author": "Eric S."}

I really tried to be impartial and not compare the two as they are very different but it was difficult.  \n\nThe food was very good, presentation was beautiful! The sushi was very pretty to look at and VERY fresh, some of the best I've had so I have no complaints about the food.\n\nThe atmosphere was clean and modern, I could have done without the house music playing in the background. Something more ambient would have been better.  It's just not good \"digestion\" music.  It was Saturday night but it was early enough to be before the club hopping starts.\n\nIt was busy but not packed.  Our waitress seemed to be in a hurry and actually made me nervous/ uncomfortable.  She was so efficient and seemed to be trying so hard that it was as if she were rushing us through our meal.  I  understand that on a Saturday night it may get busy later and it is a very small space but while we were there it would have been nice to not feel rushed.  \n\nI hope they do well but I do miss the \"homey\" atmosphere of Enoshima, I miss James and Hideo, but I wish Sushi IN the best.  I will come back but can I have a different waitress?", "author": "Nicole C."}

I like the sushi here much better than Zushi Puzzle, believe it or not. Their miso soup is always good, uni always fresh and staff very friendly. It's no Sushi Yasuda or Azabu, but $8 for two pieces of uni nigiri (always consistently fresh) gets my vote. They have an omakase special where you can get 20 pieces of nigiri for ~$50 bucks - perfect to share between two people. Not sure how their business is actually doing, given no more than half the restaurant is filled at any time I've been for dinner. Downside is the decor - they're going for a retro, futuristic effect, with sake bottles backlit with different neon colored bulbs. Kind of tacky if you ask me, and not really a great spot for dates, but for a casual, quality sushi joint that stays open late? I'm in.", "author": "Nancy Y."}

So, raw fish for me is a waste of mula. \n\nSo, I ordered the beef teriyaki entree which came with miso, a side salad and of course the beef. I ordered it well, and it was slightly burned on some of the pieces (that is why I am giving 4 stars). Besides the burning, it was very tasty. I also had the garden lover's veggie roll, which was DELICIOUS! It had sweet potato tempura and the topping was the seaweed salad.

They only have one table that can accommodate more than 4 people so I would recommend calling ahead with a larger party. That being said they were very accommodating and gave us a call when our table was ready. \n\nThe service was great I really wish I caught the name of our waitress she was very sweet and helpful. We ordered cold sake to start. Our server helped us pick out a cold sake. Apparently it won some type of competition in japan.\n\nFor food we ordered the scallop appetizer, firecracker roll, spicy tuna, toro nigiri, another roll with soft shell crab and my dad had beef teriyaki because he doesn't eat fish. The presentation was beautiful, extremely fresh fish and very delicious rolls. The flavors were really good and I really liked that the rolls were not smothered in sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-08", "description": "My friend brought me here because of the $10 for $20 Yelp deal. Upon finding out this place being located in the Marina area, I jumped into the conclusion that this must be somewhat of a \"American-Japanese fusion\" type of food. You know, where the sushi has overly drenched sauce, over sized avocado, mango, and all the other shit. \n\nWell what do you know, this place IS somewhat of a hybrid fusion. Just walking in, you'll notice that the soy sauce bottle is shaped like a teapot, which give sit a nice Japanese theme. But then it's not until you listen and notice that the background music playing is club music. Now that's an interesting mix, yeah, let's listen to some bass filled music with lyrics about sex, money, and drugs while eating sashimi and sushi. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but seeing how Japanese food tend to be \"fresh\" like being raw, not heavily flavored, mini portions, etc, I just don't see how these type of \"heavy\" music is able to blend into the food. I picture the sound of rivers flowing, koto playing, not this. But it's okay, perhaps I'm just overly traditional. \n\nGetting to the service, the waitress was really friendly. Always smiling, full of energy, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend food. Damn girl, if you weren't so innocent looking, I'd drop some perverted comments now. But too bad, you are. So I'll have to stop short and just say service here is good. \n\nThe food itself was actually not bad at all. We ordered two \"Westernized\" rolls  - Iceland roll and Mango Madness. You know, that's the thing about these \"Japanese\" rolls. It isn't Japanese at all. 49er roll? Alaska roll? Iceland roll? Mango Madness? Yeah, you're sure going to find those in Japan. Why do that? Why not give us \"real\" Japanese rolls? I came here in hoping to dine on authentic Japanese food. I expected this place as a fusion, but technically they never listed themselves as a fusion. It's like bringing your parents to a Chinese restaurant then finding out they serve Panda Express type of food. Boy your parents would be PISSED. The fuck is this sweet and sour kung pao shit? Give me the god damn Peking Duck! Anyways, back to the two rolls I ordered; although it had sauce in it, it wasn't overly drenched. The flavor managed to merge together perfectly, and dipping it in soy sauce / wasabi didn't impact it negatively at all - instead it compliments it. The rice was firm and wasn't mushy, and you can separate the slices of the fish once it melts in your mouth. For a hybrid, this was pretty impressive. Oh, don't bother ordering their \"special\" item for the time being - Anago, aka salt water eel. I'm sure we all tried Unagi before, aka freshwater eel. I was wondering if Anago would taste any different. No, it doesn't, it tastes exactly like an Unagi - even the sauce and shit is the same. Even the texture, the color, the god damn size is the same. \n\nOh, watch out for drinks that doesn't have a price tag to it. In the heat of the moment, I stupidly ordered two bottles of saki - \"MIO Sparking Sake.\" Okay look, I wouldn't have lowered this place by -2 stars just because it was expensive - it was because of how it was advertised. In the picture, it shows a bottle of the sake, along with a glass that's as tall as the bottle. Common sense tells me that this is probably a one serve drink, two the most, hence I ordered 2 bottles, thinking it couldn't be that expensive. When the bottles came, the glass were tiny, literally, it's like half a shot cup in volume. Oh, and it's carbonated. Who the fuck kinda pussyass drinks carbonated sake off half a shot cup? Anyways, so the price came to $18 per bottle, not including the tax and tips. Yeah, definitely wasn't worth it. Alcohol content was a pathetic 5%, this shit is comparable to a Mike's Hard Lemonade, except that it's less volume, less alcohol content, and ~400% more expensive. Mix that with the deceptive advertisement and there you go, -2 stars. \n\nAll in all, I'd say the food wasn't bad; I'd say above average. It definitely isn't authentic Japanese, but it's located in Marina after all. It's the pricing that bothered me - the bill came up to $100, and that's after the -$20 discount. That's just great, a $100 meal that doesn't fill you up.", "author": "Calvin D."}

The scallop lover was really interesting with the green apple flavor.  One criticism: The Sushi In Tartare was great, but the crispy wontons could have been crisper.", "author": "Ronan L."}

That's all I've had here. \n\nIt's a bit small and starts to fill up on Saturdays around 6. Both times I've been here, the tables in the back (the ones that sit more than 2) were held for reservations. It's kinda whole-in-the-wall-ish but has nice decor and is kept clean. Servers are attentive and the sushi comes out with little delay. \n\nThe sushi rolls taste just as good as they look. Fresh and creative and decently priced....and made by a real Japaneesy! I will definitely be coming back here whenever I need a sushi fix. \n\nOn a side note, I've noticed people bring their kids here. some are loud, some are quiet, some stand in their chairs and play with their chopsticks. doesn't bother me but I know some people won't like it.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "JeF m."}

But the sushi rolls were too small, I understand that tempura rolls were cheap but they shouldn't be so tiny, because i can get bigger in another place. Their signature rolls are way better but you also pay 15$ or 18$ for them, which i thought it was too much. The place is small but cute, love the decor and bathroom was clean! I went there because i was in the area and they had yelp deal, i got a free miso soup.", "author": "Marlyng P."}

Although I will say that the number of positive reviews makes me think I was just unlucky when I went there. Nevertheless, I prefer Ace's and Asa (both nearby) for inexpensive sushi.", "author": "Lindsay B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-31", "description": "My husband and I decided to try this place tonight because they deliver and the weather was pretty nasty.  Well, I sort of wished we'd just ventured out to one of our regular spots in the rain.  The sushi rolls were OK but nothing special. The fireworks roll was really tasty and probably the best thing we ordered but for $14 it was rather small, no larger then a standard tuna roll.  With all of the awesome sushi places in the neighborhood we won't be going back to Sushi In for an overpriced mediocre meal.", "author": "Rebecca S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-12-12", "description": "Fantastic sushi, nice sake selection and wonderful staff! What else can you ask for. Probably one of the best sushi places in the Marina right now. The chef is amazing. He puts a lot of attention to detail with each plating. We ordered the omakase and the sashimi was very fresh. I wished I lived closer so I can come here more often. It's a smaller restaurant so it's packed on the weekends. Weekdays are less crowded since they just opened but that'll change soon once people start hearing about this place. They also offer delivery as well which is awesome when it's too cold outside and you're craving for some fresh sashimi and rolls. I highly recommend this place especially if you're in the area.", "author": "Louie A."}
