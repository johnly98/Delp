Nice touch!\n\nFood is fantastic! Everything we had is amazing...from a flavors perspective the pickled beet salad with mozzarella and hazelnuts was petite and unassuming, but it was PACKED with flavor. The acidity of the beets balanced with the richness of the fresh mozzarella and the crunch of the hazelnuts was really a flavor combo-bomb! \n\nThe onion, pancetta pizza with an egg was off the hook! The crust was amazing, the flavors on the pizza all melded together. It was literally one of the best pizza's I've ever had in my life! We also had the agnoletti and the raviolo, both were decadent and rich, which really fills you up. \n\nWe finished with a ricotta gelato with figs and honey which was fantastic and my wife got the chocolate semi-freddo. Both a perfect way to finish our meal.\n\nThe meal was fantastic and reasonable at about $140 for everything without tip. The service was also friendly, helpful and spot-on.\n\nOne of my favorite restaurants in the Bay Area. Love this place...it's worth working it hard to get a reservation!", "author": "David L."}

The dessert was indulgent. BUT...the service was on the edge between no-nonsense and rude. My younger coworker, less familiar with Italian foos, asked some basic questions about the menu and was greeted with exasperation, especially when asking about the desserts (it surely can't be shocking that not everyone knows what a semifreddo is). When I ordered a skin-contact wine, our server reacted skeptically, doubling down when I asserted that I was a fan of the genre. There were also no coursing or ordering guidelines.\n\nI can't in good conscience recommend that you go to this restaurant with a mixed group of food and non-food people.", "author": "Than H."}

Open Table seemed to have added a bunch of openings between 4 and 5pm at the last minute - I was ready and nabbed one of them and we had a delicious, lovely dinner here.\n\nSERVICE: Very friendly & helpful. The courses had long breaks at points (esp between our pizza and the pasta), but we were having a nice time and wouldn't really have noticed, but they felt bad for 'making us wait' and brought out a complimentary Spinach Sformato to hold us over. I also appreciated that there was no rush even though we spent 4 hours on dinner!\n\nTHE COST: $400 before tips for dinner for four. Pricey, though we did splurge a little for a special occasion! \n\nMUST-HAVES: Corn Triangoli (pasta), Almond Milk Rice Pudding (dolci), and just overall their pastas are the best.\n\nTHE FOOD:\n\nHOUSE COCKTAILS\n* Saged & Confused ($14) - 3.5 stars\nBeautiful red color with a bit of foam on top, but for me too sour, a bit strong. \n\n* Mocktail (I requested herby, ginger flavors. $6) - 4 stars\nGreat, crisp drink! Well balanced.\n\nANTIPASTI\n* Roasted fig & mozzarella ($15) - 4 stars\nYou can get an amazing perfect bite of toasted bread, soft fig, and mozzarella. I just wished for something with an extra kick, like honey.\n\n* Spinach Sformato ($15) - 4 stars\nWe got this on the kitchen because our pastas were taking a while to come out and never noticed it on the menu, but it was surprisingly good, think a savory panna cotta!\n\n* Mussels, fennel, pancetta ($15) - 4 stars\nDidn't look like much of a dish to me at first, and honestly the mussels themselves were plain, too chewy, and not very fresh. However, I was surprised how much I liked the bed of veggies it sat on, and those crispy pancetta pieces were loaded with flavor and fantastic!\n\nFORNO\n* Lamb sausage pizza ($20) - 4 stars\nA good pizza overall, with great soft texture to the lamb sausage, but generally I'm not sure if I would order a pizza again for how excellent their pastas are!\n\nPRIMI\n* Agnolotti de plin ($22) - 3.5 stars\nEach piece was so small and a bit TOO densely packed with flavor and meat. Not enough subtlety to this dish for me.\n\n* Raviolo ($23) - 4.5 stars\nNot as perfect as I remembered, but still an amazing dish. Definitely a fatty, rich dish with the yolk filling and brown butter sauce!\n\n* Corn Triangoli ($24) - 5 stars\nThe favorite pasta for everyone at the table! I thought the sweet flavors would be too much, but everything came together perfectly.\n\nSECONDI\n* Lamb shank ($25) - 3.5\nFlavorful, super tender meat. But again, if I were to do it again, I'd probably order more sides or pastas.\n\nDOLCI\n* Chocolate Tartufo ($12) - 3 stars\nLeast popular of the desserts. Very plain, also came out in a wedge slice so was basically a light chocolate mousse cake.\n\n* Almond Milk Rice Pudding ($11) - 4.5 stars\nJust decent at first, but then I got to the candied hazelnuts & apricots underneath the pudding and this made the dish! Amazing combo of textures & flavors.\n\n* Vanilla Gelato Cart (off-menu dessert item, Mon-Sat only. $11) - 3.5 stars\nSimple but a good gelato, smooth soft texture. Paired nicely with the dark chocolate syrup they offered.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

We pulled up to valet and were scared off by the $18 price tag so we circled around a bit before coming back with our tails between our legs and accepting our $18 fate.\n\nSo many items on the menu sounded fantastic and we debated for quite a while before finally choosing the Summer Squash Blossom Pizza, Agnlotti del Plin, and Massa Farms Pork Chop. One word to describe the meal? Perfection!\n\nI was initially drawn to the pizza because the squash blossoms reminded me of Pizzeria Mozza back in LA but I think this pizza was even better! The pizza is also a very good value. While other menu items are on the smaller side, this pizza is big enough for a meal for one. The agnlotti was delicate and full of flavor. They were like little meat pillows from heaven. \n\nAnd the pork chop? The best pork chop I've ever had at any restaurant! Seriously, it was that good. You know how pork could be tough, chewy, and bland at times? This was the opposite of that. The thick cut was cooked all the way through while maintaining its tenderness. There was the right balance of fat and lean and everything about the dish was incredible.\n\nWe weren't sure initially if we would have enough to eat and this turned out to be more than enough for the two of us. In fact, we had leftovers for the next day. Cotogna isn't inexpensive by any means, especially with $18 parking but it was absolutely worth it!", "author": "Yi Z."}

Having enjoyed wonderful dining experiences at Cotogna in the past, I was a bit disappointed this time.  \n\nThe starters, cheese bread and tomato salad with lardo, were tasty, but not outstanding.  \n\nThe secondi pasta dishes were polar opposites!  That is, the corn ravioli was the highlight of the meal:  amazing, perfection of flavor and texture for this carboholic.  The risotto, on the other hand, was almost bland and undercooked.  It wasn't al dente because there were crunchy centers to some of the rice kernels.\n\nFinally, the entree was ribeye steaks.  Maybe it was our organizer's fault for choosing steak, but they were underwhleming.  They were inconsistently cooked with some parts rare and other parts the perfect medium rare.  The worst part is we were provided knives that I can't call steak knives because they didn't work.  Each cut was a struggle, requiring multiple back and forth pulls to cut each bite.  Frustrating!\n\nService though remains top notch.  I only wish the food quality had kept up.", "author": "Christina L."}

I knew it was a more casual restaurant to Quince next door so I was excited to try it out. Pasta made in house is one of my favorite things in the world. \n\nWe got there a little bit early and were seated. There were 4 of us so we ordered some appetizers to share:\n\nFocaccia di Recco: This was thinner than what I usually get for focaccia, it had more of a thin crust pizza texture to it. However that did not deter me from devouring lots of carbs with creamy cheese on it. \n\nRaviolo with farm egg & brown butter: I think this is one of my favorite dishes of the night. Large raviolo with egg in the middle, when I cut into it to split it with the table, the egg yolk oozed out into the pasta and brown butter. Sweet and savory goodness.\n\nYoung artichoke, mollica di pane & nocellara olive oil: Fried breadcrumbs made a great contrast to the soft artichokes, I *almost* felt healthy eating my veggies.\n\nSnap & English peas with fresh horseradish & ricotta della casa: Peas were super fresh and horseradish provided a slight kick.\n\nBurrata con caviale: This was beauitfully plated with finely chopped onions, spinach, beets and caviar on top. Served with mother of pearl spoons to spoon the caviar onto the brioche slices of bread. So luxurious!\n\nI ordered parpadelle with lamb for my main and I enjoyed the large noodles with chopped pieces of lamb, spinach and lima beans.\n\nDessert was a mountain of vanilla bean gelato rolled out on a cart with dark chocolate syrup. I can't remember what it was called (White Mountain?) but the generous portions of gelato and dark chocolate syrup made me get into a serious sugar high afterwards. Yum!\n\nI really enjoyed our dinner at Cotogna - service was efficient and on point. I will definitely come back to try the pizzas and a different pasta.", "author": "Nette T."}

Getting a reservation took me a while but it's definitely worth the wait. The food here was excellent and felt like more casual versions of some of the items I had at Quince.  \n\nOoops I did it again - ordered enough food for two people just to sample the menu and then ate it all!  My rule when I'm eating Italian is to order a salad, pasta or pizza, entree and dessert.  The line-up for me that night included:\n\n(1). Purple snow, snap and English peas with fresh horseradish and house ricotta (5/5) - Cotogna and Quince source their vegetables from a local farmer where they control what's grown and this has really elevated all of the fresh vegetables in this dish. The peas are definitely the star of this dish and deservedly so. \n(2).  Garganelli with fava bean, pancetta and morel mushrooms (5/5) - great pasta cooked perfectly and I love the earthiness of the mushrooms with the saltiness of the pancetta.  \n(3).  Pork chop with spigarello, calcot onion and aceto balsamico (5/5) - I saw the pork chop roasting when I entered the restaurant and I knew then that I was going to order this.  No regrets whatsoever. It's one of the juiciest and well cooked pork chops I've had. \n(4). Torched meringue with strawberry sorbet and buttermilk granita (5/5) - just a perfect dessert to end the meal. \n\nI also had New Zealand ginger beer (fantastic) during the meal and peppermint tea before dessert. Service was great (Thanks Katia).  The ambiance here is very warm and modern.  The above meal, including tax and tip, was about $120 (again, I think it's more than enough for two people to share).

Personally I'd have broken it up into two (NorCal and SoCal), but whatever. \n\nThis list came out when I knew I was already going up to SF for a family visit, and immediately made reservations for two so I could try it out (as the fuck if I could afford Atelier Crenn, the #1 spot). I'd never been to Quince, and thought this would be a nice, casual way to enjoy a piece of that while soaking in Cotogna's deliberate experience, too. \n\nFor an antipasti, I ordered the Spinach sformato with Parmigiano Reggiano fonduta, which is apparently like a spinach custard? It was really good - recommended by our server. My friend Beau had the halibut crudo, and liked it as well. If you're looking to avoid heavy cream stuff, skip the sformato. For our main entree he got the pizza with lamb, and I got the Raviolo with farm egg and brown butter. This was an AMAZING dish, but admittedly, with the butter it felt like I was about to go into insulin shock. Fuck, if my doctor in six months says I have type 2 diabetes I wouldn't be surprised. Just dripping in butter...but so good. Ugh. \n\nOkay so if you thought THAT was the reason why I'd have diabetes, well maybe it isn't. Maybe it was the giant mountain of vanilla gelato brought over on a cart, quenelled three times into a silver dish and topped with a ridiculous dark chocolate sauce. Maybe that would have been it? Beau laughed when I skipped the verbena sorbet for this recommendation, but  when I let him have the last 1.5 scoops, he inhaled it after the first bite. Best gelato he's ever tasted - and I'd have to agree. Vanilla has never been less boring than in this dish - ultimate complexity, simplicity, just perfect.\n\nIt wasn't a cheap experience, but definitely well worth it. Will it make MY top 38 restaurants in CA? Maybe. Maybe because I can't afford to go anywhere else and it'll be a short list? Top 20. Whatever, it's worth it.", "author": "Jaime L."}

Even softer and fluffier with true pistachio from Sicily. \n\nProsciutto with pomegranate and mustard greens - love the prosciutto in this dish - Delightfully thin and none of that super saltiness that often accompanies cured meat. \n\nVegetable ministrone soup - the broth is bursting with flavor, sign of a home-made soup made with love. Pretty filling - we took some of this home to not cram our stomach for other dishes. \n\nPappardelle with lamb, spirula, carrot - the pasta just shines on this one. Perfectly al dente, with crispy lamb strips and just enough sauce to complement the rest of the dish (rather than the soupy Americanized Italian version) \n\n\nALSO DELICIOUS LIST:\nHedgehog mushroom and leek pizza* - distinctive taste and aromatics of the mushroom fills this pizza. Thin but not burnt crust. \n\nPappardelle with wild boar sugo - rich flavor. Like the texture on the pappardelle. \n\nBeef stew in red wine - the polenta is out of this world that accompanies this beef stew.

It's $750 minimum for a group of 6-12, and with taxes and gratuity it comes out to over $1000. We ended up paying close to $140 per person.  (My friend took care of our reservation so I'm not sure what the policies are for booking that table.)  I was also hesitant to have to sit at a picnic-style table with benches, but it was pretty spacious for my party of 8, and we had plenty of room for ourselves plus our purses.  It was nice because while all the other tables in the restaurant were packed very closely together, our table had plenty of space all around us, and we had a nice view of either the street outside or the pizza oven depending on which side of the table we were sitting on.  Also, service was very good, and our water glasses never went empty throughout the evening.\n\nAs for food, we had a special menu put together just for us, and I filled up on the first couple of courses so that I could get my money's worth lol, plus they were both very good.  Our starter was focaccia that looked like a cheese pizza, and after that was maybe my favorite, pole beans and lemon cucumbers with anchovy-mustard vinaigrette.  The next couple of courses were just okay to me, corn triangoli della casa, and Acquerello Carnaroli risotto with squash blossom.  It was my first time having risotto, and while not terrible, it's not something I can see myself craving when I go out to eat.  We ended strong though with courses that I liked.  For our main entree we had Don Watson lamb with haricot vert, baby carrots, and Jimmy Nardello pepper.  It also was my first time having lamb and was warned it could be \"gamey\" and people either love it or hate it.  It didn't taste what I imagine gamey to be like though and I ended up enjoying it.  Unfortunately by that point I was stuffed and had very little room for it.  I did make room however for their very delicious dessert, Fresh Run Farm strawberry crostata, basically strawberry pie on a tasty, flaky crust with a side of yummy cream.  We all loved that one! To drink, I had the Chef's Choice, which was a fruity non-alcoholic drink that was really good!\n\nAs for parking, my friends were able to find nearby street parking easily around 5:30pm on a Saturday, while I parked in a garage just a couple blocks away.  Also, the women's restroom was clean, at least the stall I used.  (You have to walk through the kitchen to get to the restrooms, which felt really weird!)\n\nOverall, my friends and I had a good experience - thanks, Cotogna!", "author": "Carnita M."}

Gots ta review Cotogna.\n\nBack in the bay for a long weekend, chose to celebrate my anniversary in the City, but I haven't lived there since high school - the only restaurants I've heard of in the Bay are Intl Smoke (cuz DubNation) and Brown Sugar (via Top Chef). Was hoping to find something chill with less hype, so I hit up Eater SF for their hot 38, and a gut feeling (plus available tables on my preferred night) led me to reserve a spot at Cotogna for a Sunday night.\n\nWe pulled up to the corner and used the valet parking, and were pleased to see a intimate dining room with a clean modern look, and a rustic wood-fire burning cozily in the open kitchen. \n\nAt our table, we chose a few delicious cocktails and were happy to see literally every menu item was something exciting and new. Our order of 6 dishes went as such:\n\nHalibut crudo w/ watermelon radish, fennel, and garlic chip - probably the weakest course, the garlic was a bit much and took over the subtle flavors. We enjoyed it, but were happy things took a step up from there. 5th place\n\nFried Petrale sole w/ lemon caper aioli and crispy parsley - oh man I love writing Yelp review because my mouth just starts watering - this was the perfect fried fish, crispy coating and flaky, juicy fish with my wife's spirit sauce. And the fried parsley, a stellar salt-and-peppery seasoning crunch, gave a great texture and surprise to liven things up. 2nd place\n\nCheese & mushroom pizza - the pizza would probably have been good accompanying a Netflix binge on a couch, but it was the clear loser this night. Felt like filler, we shouldn't have ordered it, well seasoned, but a tad goopy in the middle. 6th place\n\nFarmer's ricotta ravioli with egg yolk and browned butter sauce - BAM! This was the 1st place star - filled with gooey perfection, egg yolk bursting and mingling with the cheese, butter, and pasta, we legit scraped the plate clean with out spoons* \n\n*yes, so runny it is served w/ SPOONS! Your forks are useless against us!!!\n\nDuck with orange and greens - a great entree, duck that melted in our mouths and the greens and orange interjected with sweet and bitter notes. 3rd place\n\nDeconstructed tiramisu (w/ anniversary sorbet) - the mellow flavors of a classic spread around so that each bite stood out a little differently, unlike the perfect distribution of the elements in a usual tiramisu. 4th place\n\nService was great, attentiveness by the whole staff, from bidders to servers to front of house. At one point, they brought a dish out while my wife was in the restroom, and they promptly asked \"You want us to wait and bring it out when she's back?\" Nice touch.

Tucked away on the corner of Pacific Ave. and Montgomery St. in the Jackson Square neighborhood, the location of this restaurant makes it easily forgettable. \n\nBut alas, I remembered Cotogna, on a windy San Francisco night en route to, you guessed it, Cigar Bar. \n\nI booked a reservation here about a month in advance, and snagged a 5.30PM table. When my colleague and I walked in, the place was not surprisingly packed, given its location next to the Financial District. What was surprising, is that the crowd was mostly older couples and families opting for an early dinner, and not the typical Financial District after-hours business crowd. We arrived a few minutes early, and we were seated right away.\n\nUpon walking into this restaurant, you feel at home. The comfortability of the darker cast iron, wood and brick decor contributes immensely to the ambiance. This is also reflected in the menu items; the flavors here are both inventive, yet approachable. \n\nWe started our meal with a dirty martini (vodka) with extra olives ($14) and a glass of sparkling Acari e Danesi, Franciacorta, Extra Brut from Lombardy ($16). The martini was, well, a typical martini, but the sparkling wine was refreshing and a bit on the drier side. \n\nWe decided to order two antipasti and a forno dish to share. This was a satisfying amount of food for two people, but for a grander appetite, I would suggest adding an additional, smaller plate to the course.\n\nThe snap & English peas with fresh horseradish & ricotta della casa ($13) was exactly as it's described. The peas were cooked in a way so that they didn't lose their crunch and still maintained the earthiness of the vegetables. The horseradish balanced the flavor of the rich ricotta more than it contributed a heat factor. Drizzled with olive oil.\n\nThe young artichoke, mollica di pane & nocellara olive oil ($17) was our favorite dish. The artichoke hearts were served room temperature and had a slight brine flavor as if they were pickled. The standout contribution to this dish was the mollica di pane, which is a Sicilian topping typically reserved for pasta dishes. The deep herbal and garlic flavor of the bread crumbs were perfectly fried, and added a nice crunch to the tender artichoke hearts.\n\nWe ended our meal with the lamb sausage, gypsy pepper & oregano pizza ($20). This pizza had many things I look for in a pizza: thin pie, doughy crust and very, very cheesy. The gypsy peppers added a little sweetness to balance out the rich flavors of the cheese and lamb. As an aside, there are two things I would like to point out: 1) It was noticeably more oily than most pizzas, and combined with the thinness of the pie itself, things became a flimsy and messy, and 2) There weren't that many pieces of lamb, making the meat more of an accoutrement added on top of a cheese pizza, more than anything else.\n\nFor a restaurant that orients itself toward Italian cuisine, I was pleasantly surprised to see a decent selection of non-pork options on the menu. This restaurant is not a place I would go out of my way for, but it's a solid option if you have reason to be in the area. I do plan to return in the future, and look forward to trying some of their other menu items, including the handmade pastas.", "author": "Kimberlee P."}

The Agnolotti del pin was truly a work of art and unlike anything I've had even in Italy ( a definite) $22.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-20", "description": "It kind of pains to me to say this... but I was pretty underwhelmed by my lunch at Cotogna yesterday. I had dined here years ago and enjoyed my experience and was looking forward to revisiting their rustic Italian menu. But this time around, I left here unsatisfied, still hungry, and $120 poorer.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't mind paying for a fine meal. But my dining companion and I shared an appetizer and two dishes (two of which were decent; one was practically inedible); I had a Negroni; she had iced tea; and the check after tax/tip was $120. I won't lie - that was a hard pill (bill) to swallow.\n\nThat being said, the lunch wasn't a completely negative experience. The Negroni I ordered was an expertly balanced mix of Hendrick's gin, sweet vermouth, and Campari. Even though I ordered it on the rocks, the server brought it to me neat. No biggie. It was still delicious.\n\nThe star of our meal was surprisingly the Romanesco broccoli sformato (which is essentially like a creamy souffl\u00e9 served with a light, green sauce). I've never had broccoli like this before - it was a true winner.\n\nThe next two dishes we split were the Conchiglioni with smoked black trumpet mushroom & Brussels sprout and the Chitarra (a fancy way of saying egg noodles) with Dungeness crab & lime. Of the two dishes, the Chitarra was the tastier one. However, aside from the crab which was fresh and plentiful, the other flavors fell flat for me. My dining companion seemed to like this dish more than I did. The Conchiglioni (a fancy way of saying seashell pasta) was a total disappointment. First off, the pasta was overcooked to the point where it was crunchy. And the mushrooms and Brussels sprouts had zero flavor. And there was really nothing else to the dish to make it stand out or worth the $22 price tag.\n\nOur server was friendly, but he seemed a bit overwhelmed as the place started to fill up. We had to ask him repeatedly for my friend's iced tea, he botched my cocktail order, and there was a long gap between our broccoli starter and our two entrees. \n\nAll in all, I'd give Cotogna another chance. It's certainly a good restaurant. I just think they had an off day and we maybe ordered the wrong things. And next time, I'll be better prepared for the steep pricing.", "author": "Kevin B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-27", "description": "Over the years, le bf and I have visited Cotogna at least 6 times. Our most recent experience on 6/25/18 let us down. I am giving Cotogna 3 stars because every other time we have visited, it had always been 5 stars, but it fell very short on Monday.\n\nDuring our most recent experience, we ordered:\n1. Bay shrimp with avocado, butter lettuce & green goddess ($15)\n2. Summer squash blossom pizza ($23)\n3. Agnolotti del plin ($22)\n4. Fried pork chop with mustard potatoes ($26?)\n\nWe normally also get the Raviolo but because the waiter said that the pork chop was a decent size, we decided against it. We have never been let down by the Raviolo and would recommend it. Le bf also ordered a glass of the Barbera, which he super enjoyed. \n\nIt took awhile for our first bites to arrive. The bay shrimp was just half an avocado, a bit of bay shrimp that replaced where the avocado pit would be, and a bit of butter lettuce sprinkled on the plate covered in green goddess dressing. I thought it was pretty good, le bf didn't think so, and I think he is a bigger fan of Cotogna than I am.\n\nBoth le bf and I are huge fans of squash blossoms. It was a white pizza with cheese, squash blossoms and ground black pepper. I normally don't go for a white pizza but I thought it was good, definitely not my favorite pizza, but still good. Le bf also wasn't a huge fan. He said the flavors just weren't there for him.\n\nNext came the Agnolotti. This was the first time that they had split the Agnolotti onto 2 different plates. This has always been le bf's favorite dish at Cotogna, ever since the first time he tried it. It was also the first time they didn't shower our Agnolotti in freshly grated cheese. Normally, there is 1 plate of Agnolotti and the server will come with the cheese and just COVER the pasta with cheese. On Monday, nobody came around with the grater. We also couldn't locate our waiter so I waited for about 10 minutes before the waiter showed up. Le bf who was too hungry almost finished by the time I flagged the waiter down. Apparently the whole no cheese situation was new. The waiter did eventually bring out the cheese and only did a very minor sprinkling of cheese. Without the cheese, the Agnolotti seemed a bit dry. With the cheese, it tasted a bit saltier, more flavorful and added that bit of oil that made the pasta more fatty, in a totally yummy way. \n\nWe also ordered the pork chop after we read a really good review about it from another Yelp Eliter. If you've had a pork katsu, it was like that, but less flavorful because it wasn't served with a sauce. The mustard purple potatoes were very meh and so was the mini salad that came with it. The portion was generous, but it lacked the moisture and flavor we had come to expect from Cotogna.\n\nOverall, if this was my first experience at Cotogna, I would say I wouldn't recommend it. However, knowing what Cotogna is capable of, I would say that hopefully this was an off-day and that I would give it another shot. Le bf who had been looking forward to this reservation for awhile looked so dejected after our meal. He said the best thing about the visit to Cotogna was the wine. It also doesn't help that we were shoved out the door. After we got up from our table, the hostess held our bags outside of the restaurant so that we had to physically leave the property to retrieve the bags we had them hold....super awkward....", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

I must say I liked my choices the first time a little better...\n\nI came here most recently for Valentine's Day--it was a slight pity that they didn't have a Valentine's menu but that was alright! It was also nice to be able to choose anything you wanted.\n\nI'll list a couple things I had from the first time as well:\n1: Whole yolk in raviolo: not bad! I definitely think this one looks better in pictures than it actually tastes, but still it was good! A little too rich for me, but I think that's entirely just my personal preference. Creamy yolk and brown butter... very indulgent! Well, I just love brown butter anyway\n2: Special from first visit: Monterey bay squid ink pasta--this was AMAZING, so incredible I just really had to mention it, please order it if you ever see it again. Seafood was incredibly fresh, topped with fresh tomatoes and just an incredibly light, flavorful sauce. Not fishy at all. You know they got the seafood the day of.\n3: Agnolotti dal Plin: I loooove agnolotti, and I love the one at flour + water. You know, this doesn't disappoint. Agnolottis are always just these little amazing heavenly pockets of joy bursting with flavor. You look at them and they look plain, and just, boring, but seriously, their looks do them no justice. Every mouthful is pure pleasure. That amazingly delicious sauce? I asked my server--nothing but brown butter! How perfectly simple.\n4: Some strange brussel sprouts smoked mushroom shell pasta: nope. Never ordering this again. I think this must've been an experiment. It wasn't dreadful, but nothing compared to anything else on the menu. It was a pity that the brussel sprouts overwhelmed all the smoked mushroom. Also they were stuffed and baked pasta that turned out quite dry... My boyfriend wanted this for the mushrooms, but honestly all you taste is brussel sprouts! (This was truly a strange anomaly of a dish, so I will not dock any stars off my rating.)\n5: Tiramisu: not your classic tiramisu, but the additions and changes certainly were surprisingly perfect! I loved the cocoanib salted caramel rice puff crunchy thingies that just gave the smooth, rich, velvety cream a nice balance. The salt really just picked the whole thing up.

I was trying to make a decision between two dishes on the menu, and the ever-so stubborn waitress would not help me.  I've never seen anything quite like it - she was almost upset with me for asking for her to go one way or the other.  \n\nHer:  \"Well, the two dishes are *completely* different.  You can hardly compare them.\"\n\nMe:  \"...Not trying to compare them, just trying to decide which one to order.

Didn't sog out on me.  The sausage was salty but distinctive.  Mild char on the crust. I would have liked more char and bubbliness to the crust but it checked out OK.  \n\nSPAGHETTI W/SQUID (4/5) - Big squid lover.  This dish would have been perfect had someone not got carried away with the salt in the kitchen.  Super salty and my threshold for salt is pretty high.  This was worthy of turning the dish back for a re-do, but I didn't have the time or the patience, neither was I in the mood for making waves, so I just decided to get my week's worth of sodium in one sitting.  :)  It was still delicious even through the salt which is saying something.\n\nI liked Cotogna a lot.  I liked their simple, not overly busy menu. As a side note, as a budding restauranteur, I loved the set-up of their kitchen.  Hard to describe, but they had each room of the kitchen separate from each other.  One hallway and 4 separate \"cove\" kitchens. Really cool.

They had this denim print and had a hem like jeans.\n\nWe started with the salad and the Pumpkin sformato as starters. The sformato was great! It tasted like sweet pumpkin with a hint of cheese.

We tried some kind of tortellini and the Agnolotti dal plin (rabbit pork and veal ravioli) and those were delicious! Nothing was super heavy either.\n\nFor dessert, we had a sorbet with passionfruit.

So early afternoon on a Saturday I was hungry for something special, and have been wanting to try this place. So I showed up around 2:30 without reservations. There were plenty of seats at the bar available. This place is just as good as everybody says it is. I had their famous Agnoletti Plin with a fantastic glass of Barolo. $22 for each of them.  I asked for sparkling water and they gave me a refillable bottle, which was $8.\n\nEvery single thing was close to perfect. The service was just right, the food was perfect, and the Barolo was a masterful wine choice for this dish-recommended by the helpful bartender. The reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that it is a little pricey. But thank God we have a place like this around when we decide we want to spend a little more!  I won't be here every day for lunch, but I will definitely be back here on special occasions and hopefully more than once.

We had to wait at a drinking hole nearby about an hour before we were able to sit at the bar. I don't believe in long waits, but it was well worth it.\n\nThe tiny little agnolotti pasta (stuffed with veal & pork) in brown butter sauce was packed with flavors yet seemed so simple. The leg of lamb served cut up and boneless was the perfect medium rare tenderness, fat rendered nicely leaving still a juicy meat sitting on a bed of caponata. For the record, I'm really picky about lamb because I find them mostly too gamey for my taste. I washed my meal with their Saged & Confused cocktail, which was well balanced and had beautiful aromatics. An Italian pop tart with its flaky crust enveloping a lightly sweetened berry filling ended the meal nicely.\n\nI was thoroughly impressed with the food, service, and ambiance of Cotogna.

The foccaccia is really buttery and soft, and the bruschetta was INCREDIBLE. Super crunchy, with amazing burrata and toppings.\n\nThe gnocchi with pesto/tomato was probably the least impressive of the dishes. It was still good, but didn't have as complex of a texture profile as the other dishes we had, so it was something I enjoyed tasting but didn't want to eat a lot of.

The search for another Italian restaurant with delicious Italian cuisine in the city has ended with this place. Flour + Water will always be num\u00e9ro uno in my heart but Cotogna's amazing menu is so mighty tasty that it's going to come pretty close. \n\nCotogna is located on Pacific Avenue in the Financial District of San Francisco. It's next to Quince, its fine-dining and pricey sister restaurant. (Haven't been yet but hoping to in the future!) There's valet parking by the front entrance. There's also plenty of street parking around that area without meters. It looks like that area isn't too hard to find available parking though. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is clean and industrial chic. The dining room isn't that large but they managed to fit in a bar and small open kitchen area. There's maybe 4 or 5 seats in front of the open kitchen which shows cylindrical slabs of porchetta roasting over open fire. (Yes, we are definitely sitting there next time.) Our server came by many times to ask how the food was. They even split our pasta on separate plates because they knew we were sharing everything. We ordered a pizza and pasta. They were both excellent in flavor and taste. The pizza wasn't overly charred which is a plus. \n\nPizze. Prociutto w/ Asparagus : This was a delicious thin-crust. Their prociutto isn't the thinly-sliced kind. It's a diced ham kind. If it was the sliced kind, the presentation would probably be better. \n\nTagliatelle w/ Oxtail Ragu : This was SO GOOD. I would order this again in a flash! There was plenty of oxtail meat too. The pasta was chewy and al dent\u00e9. I'm dreaming about it right now.....\n\nChocolate and Hazelnut Budino : This isn't the kind if budino I'm used to. It's a lighter version. At other restaurants it's richer and creamier.

Unfortunately, even as a solo eater, they couldn't seat me right away. A thirty minute stint at another bar awaited me, but finally I was called in for a spot at at the chef's counter.\n\nService is a little slow, as they are catering to a packed house.

The cocktails rotate, but I will say that I don't think you can go wrong.\n\nSame goes for the food. I got the Triangoli with corn & chives. It was light, creamy and delicious. I will say that one of my reservations about eating here is that I wasn't in the mood for heavy food (I know, why did I order pasta?!), but this dish was a perfect balance.

The gelato cart kept me coming back, but never again. My visit yesterday totally RUINED my experience, and I will NEVER be back.\n\nI had a reservation and was seated immediately upon arrival. My server asked if she could go through anything on the menu with me, and I told her that I don't eat cheese, so could she give us some recs on pastas without cheese! She seemed very taken aback and made me feel like if I didn't eat cheese, I shouldn't have come to Cotogna (a feeling I had never felt before). She gave two recs on pasta and a few appetizers. We ended up ordering the Taglietelle and mushroom pizza without cheese. Both were very underwhelming, but I was just trying to stay positive and look forward to the best part, the gelato cart!\n\nAfter we finished our pizza and pasta, our server came by to ask us if we wanted dessert. I asked her about the gelato cart and she told me that the gelato cart was not ready. WTF. I asked her when it would be ready (so maybe I could just talk and hangout/wait until then) and she told me it's whenever the pastry chef is ready aka no clear answer, ugh! She proceeded to say the vanilla gelato is the exact same, so we could get that, which I agreed to since hey, at least we would get the same ice cream sundae the gelato cart usually creates, right? NOPE, when she brought out the gelato, it was just three scoops of white gelato, no chocolate sauce, no nothing. VERY diff from the gelato cart. I asked my server if we could get the same as the gelato cart, and she said unfortuantely the chocolate sauce isn't ready and I asked her when it would be, and she said whenever the pastry chef has it fixed up....I was clearly pretty upset and I asked her again to ask the pastry chef when it would be ready, so she begrudgingly asked. She finally brought out the chocolate sauce for us. To be honest, I'm not sure if I was just in an awful mood because of the terrible service or the lack of gelato cart, but the gelato tasted nowhere as good as my memory. I asked our server again when the gelato cart is normally ready, so I could prevent this similar experience from happening again and her response to me was it totally varies, she doesn't know and it just depends on the pastry chef...This is absolutely AWFUL. There are people like me who come JUST for the gelato and for it to be so unreliable? Definitely not worth it.\n\nGiven the awful experience and how unreliable the gelato cart is, I will NOT be back and I would not recommend this place to anyone else.

Portions were perfectly sized too.  \n-- Monterey Bay squid, serpent cucumber & haricot vert ($15)- the squid was well seasoned and perfectly cooked- yay non-rubbery squid!  I'm usually not a fan of cucumber, but it was actually a great palatte cleanser for the squid (which wasn't so fishy, but still).  \n\n-- Melon, fennel, corn appetizer ($15) - light and very refreshing, with a cream sauce to add a bit of richness.  \n\n-- Pappardelle with lamb ragout ($20) - the staff were nice enough to split this dish into two portions so we could share.  The pasta was cooked well al-dente, with a bit of bite to it (which is how we like our pasta).  The ragout was slightly watery for my liking but tasted delicious!  \n\n-- Spit roasted chicken with corn & chanterelle mushrooms ($29) - nicely cooked, with super crispy skin but still juicy on the inside.  The corn added a light sweetness to the dish, contrasted with the earthy mushroom taste.  Sauce was rich and so flavorful without making you feel too heavy afterwards.\n\n-- Lemon panna cotta with pink pearl apples & fennel ($9) - we opted for a light, refreshing dessert and the waiter recommended the panna cotta.  Texture was great and we both loved the lemon flavor.  Apples added a good sweet/tart crunch to the creamy panna cotta.  \n\nVenue / Service: this is where I'm on the fence / hope it was just a one time fluke.  We were somewhat awkwardly placed in a seat right behind the front desk, so I kept getting bumped into by the host/ had to pull in my chair so much that I was squished between the chair and table.  The staff in general were very professional.  However, they forgot to mention that ordering water would cost us (one of those bottles that are refilled with tap water and are usually free at other places) so we were given a rather bitter surprise that two of these cost us $40... I don't mind them charging us for water but really?  How can you \"forget\" to mention that?  At least the staff were nice enough to not bill us this time after we explained that no one told us it was charged.  Also not sure if the kitchen all of a sudden became busy or people started taking breaks, but we had to wait nearly half an hour between our pasta and chicken course (we had asked them to bring dishes roughly one at a time).  The staff kept coming around to reassure us that the chicken was coming (\"it'll be out in 5 min\"), but not quite sure if chicken takes that long to fire.  \n\nAll in all, service was somewhat lacking but given how good the food was, I'm hoping it was a one-time fluke.  Hard to imagine that a restaurant with that mediocre service could produce some great dishes, so I'll give a benefit of the doubt and hope that I'm not being too harsh.", "author": "Audrey H."}

Imagine a butter sauce, seasoned, with the sweetness of the corn without the corn being overbearingly sweet and you have the perfect sauce. The Agnolotti was good and the sauce was also delicious. We were extremely stuffed by the end of the last dish so we weren't able to get dessert, but the table next to us got ice cream with some sauce (that looked like chocolate sauce) and we were definitely jealous.

Overall, the decor and open fire kitchen is beautiful and creates a really great dining ambience to heighten the experience of the amazing Italian dishes.\n\n[Dinner/Wine]\nI've been to Cotogna twice, and each experience was amazing. I've tried the Raviolo (a must), the Pappardelle, Spring onion pizza, and mozzarella cherry tomato antipasti. The 4/5 rating really was brought on by how minuscule the mozzarella dish was for 15 dollars. I was really disappointed in this dish as it was almost encouraged by the server for us to order another dish for our two pastas, but it was really unnecessary. Definitely order the Raviolo with the focaccia bread to dip in the egg yolk. The spring pizza was just ok, I would definitely recommend sticking with the pasta dishes. There is a great wine selection and pricier cocktails to pair with your pastas. I normally always go with a server recommended pairing. \n\n[Desert]\nSecret menu gelato cart. Enough said. It is a complete show. A chef wheels out a humongous mound of gelato on a cart, where they then make a gelato sundae drizzled with chocolate sauce for you. \n\n[Decor/Service]\nGreat and attentive service, with attention to changing silverware between meals.

There was also the Lunar new year festival and Giants event that same day in the city so not surprising everywhere was pretty busy. \n\nHad the paparadelle which is one of my favorite pastas. It was decent but the only thing was the meat needed a little more seasoning like salt, slightly more bland but still good. We also tried the rabbit pasta dish I can't remember the name but almost like a ravioli. I was hesitant to try since it had rabbit and sometimes I don't feel that adventurous with eating new meat but I'm sure it was not much and I couldn't actually tell.\n\nAmbiance is more casual than I expected for a $$$ place. Good for group and family gatherings though as the tables can be moved and the place is pretty open.", "author": "Melissa L."}

It is now 11:15pm (2 hours!!) and we have had the appetizer and wine ONLY.  Needless to say we are starving still and what started as a great experience (delicious wine) has now turned pretty crappy. We are bit tipsy and starving = not a good combo. Overall, Cotogna you disappoint. I expected more, especially since this was an anniversary dinner.

I made a lunchtime reservation last week and was very excited to see the offering of PPP because it changes so frequently. \n\nAnyway, let the food reviewing begin. I ordered a few different things to share with a friend of mine and they were all fabulous. \n\n- Grilled Sardines - served with traditional/seasonal beans raisins, shallots and parsely. This dish was light and a great start to the meal. Nice to have a sardine served up without any red sauce so the true flavors of fish weren't masked. \n\n- Stricchetti con pesto Genovese - served with seasonal green beans and purple potatoes. The pasta was just under al dente but, the flavor of the pesto made up for that shortcoming. \n\n- Tagliatelle al ragout modenese - definitely the highlight of lunch. There were five different types of meat in this ragout (oxtail, pork, shank, etc.). Tremendous flavor and the tagliatelle was divine. \n\n- Dark chocolate torta, Marsala & caramel - well, if you want to serve me crack on a plate then I guess you succeeded.

It is hidden on a side street of North Beach among art galleries and some start-ups. Once you walk in, you realize this place means serious business. They got a fire oven for their pizza, fresh handmade pasta and slobs of steak ready to be grilled and served. \n\nWe started our dinner with some delicious Beets salad and it is not a big portion but hit the spot. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara while my husband got their famous jumbo ravioli stuffed with ricotta cheese. I loved the spaghetti because it was cooked to perfection and the sauce was rich and thick, just the way I like it. My husband's ravioli was very creamy and cheesy. He enjoyed it very much as well. I do think the portion is on the smaller side so he had to eat some of my pasta to feel more full. \n\nWe ended the dinner with their sticky toffee pudding. It was sweet and a bit sticky but perfect for sharing as a couple. \n\nOverall, the service was friendly and swift and ambiance is quite romantic and cozy. I would absolutely come back for more pasta!", "author": "Athena C."}

The restaurant is an easy walk from our hotel.  Its a trendy cafe with outdoor seating and an open kitchen, with flames flickering in the pizza oven and lots of copper pots hanging.\n\nThe menu is mostly in Italian, so we relied on the waiter's recommendations for the most part.  Overall we had two outstanding dishes, one good dish, and one dish that was a head scratcher.  Overall, 3 stars - quality-wise, some bright spots.  Pricey for the portion size, so I would recommend ordering more rather than less dishes for a better experience.\n\nSmoked Swordfish with Meyer lemon was excellent!  Soft, very flavorful swordfish chunks and tender potatoes.  5 stars.\n\nFocaccia was another winner - buttery, spicy (from chili), and incredibly warm, soft, and chewy!  5 stars.\n\nAgnolotti was a dish of little pillow-shaped pasta filled with ground meat (rabbit and pork I think) and sprinkled with parmesan.  Not bad, though a bit on the rich side. 3 stars.\n\nOur final dish was a vegetarian dish of roasted broccoli, parsnips, and artichokes with a milky sauce of more artichokes.  This was a tasty dish, but it was a relatively small dish (closer to a side dish) and was the most expensive dish we ordered at $21 (?!).  We were a bit befuddled since it we could not figure out how on earth a dish like this can fetch such a price...perhaps the veggies were hand-picked from some private garden or the like. \n\nAnyways, a good place for drinks and casual lunch - just be sure to come in a group to order more dishes.  Prices high for portion size, but again decent quality.", "author": "Daniel C."}

We had heard nothing but good things, but waited to try it out due to the higher end prices. We finally planned a night to knock it out, and I can tell you that we had no regrets. The food was exceptional and well worth the money. The seating was at a community style table which I'm usually not too fond of, but the atmosphere and the kind, helpful staff quickly helped to overlook that detail. Everything on the menu, and the few things that weren't, was explained to us, before ordering. We asked for their recommendations and which plates were favored amongst other visitors, and it did not disappoint. The food presentation was gorgeous, and it tasted even better. I dont consider myself a foodie, but my wife loves all the finer things when it comes to food. I absolutely loved my meal and my wife still rants about her meal and hopes to return sooner than later.

I knew I had to come when it was mentioned briefly in one of the Netflix series \"Mind of a Chef\" episodes that featured April Bloomfield. Top notch pasta all made in house? UMM YES PLEASE. I don't even care if Kim K or Kanye dined here.\n\nThankfully it's not egregious to score a reservation here! I've always been curious about this place.. an unassuming brick building on a corner in the quiet and desolate Jackson Square area.. not really a reason to come to this area unless you plan to venture out to North Beach afterwards - at least that means parking isn't horrendous.\n\nCame around 5:30 on a Sunday to a half-full restaurant (half an hour early for our reservation), and it filled up quick! Reservations recommended. The space was modern but rustic, I loved the wooden tables and benches. Lots of natural light from the huge windows. Gets a bit loud but I guess that kind goes with the Italian 'family-style' feel.\n\nI came here to celebrate an anniversary with my boyfriend and they customized the placemat which was thoughtful! Seems like a lot of people come here to celebrate events as the group next to us had a birthday, and the table next to us was also celebrating an anniversary. We received complementary champagne which was a nice touch. (If you want to keep the placement as a memento, feel free to ask the host for a clean copy as they print extras!)\nBoth the server and hostess congratulated us on our anniversary as we sat down, and I already knew we'd have great service throughout our meal.\n\nMost of the menu was in Italian (the pastas) which was intimidating but the server explained each item thoroughly.. I wanted to try everything! It seems like most of their menu is seasonal as well (guaranteeing the freshest of ingredients!) so that means I have to come back.. I don't mind :)\n\nWe got three pasta dishes, a salad, and cannoli for dessert. \n\nEverything was delicious but my favorite was hands down the raviolo di ricotta - served year round. This was definitely my favorite of the night as it's a huge ravioli with a soft cooked egg inside with melted cheese on the outside. Savory, creamy, buttery, rich.. TO DIE FORRR.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant, especially if you LOVE pasta. Their pastas aren't overpowered with sauces and cheese and simply brings out the best of the ingredients being used, all of which are seasonal. Their desserts don't disappoint either as the cannoli was amazing, and my coworker said that their sorbet was amazing (even when I asked. just.. sorbet?!) It wasn't on the menu when I was there but I'll have to try it when I see it as well!\n\nIt was on the pricier side but definitely paying for the quality and service! I thought pricing was quite fair for ~135 (pre-tip) for 2 cocktails, 3 pasta dishes, 1 salad, and dessert!\n\nDefinitely going to return to try their pizzas as well next time and looking forward to see what will be on their pasta list next time!", "author": "Emily C."}

The agnolotti had a unexpected sweet taste to it. For the pretty high price, I don't think this place was worth it, given the size and mediocre taste.

The place was about half full with people dressed in business suits finishing up their lunch. \n\nThey only had one table for two available outside at the time so my friend and I decided to sit at the bar. Took about 10 min for us to get acknowledged because the bartender was so busy making drinks the whole time. \n\nThe menu doesn't have a description for most of their items so I had to ask what each of the pasta dishes were. He had a pretty thick accent so i couldn't really understand. I ended up going with the \"taglierini con granchio\" which is pretty much linguine pasta with Dungeness crab bits and some lemon juice. Food took about 15 min to arrive and I finished that whole plate of pasta pretty quickly. I thought the portions were pretty small for the price. But flavor was superb.\n\nBoth my friend and I were still hungry after so we each ordered a dessert. I got the dark chocolate torta and he got the strawberry panna cotta. Both were 9 dollars each.

I highly recommend their pizza. I've had some good pizza in Boston and NYC, and this is right up there with the best. We were there at around 3pm on a Tuesday, so we got to see the servers get together trying various wine and make sure they understand what they're serving that night. We saw the kitchen staff hauling fresh veggies, not boxed veggies, but freshly picked veggies. If you walk past their kitchen to the bathroom, you'll see just how well organized and clean their kitchen is. Always a great sign of a good restaurant. Overall, this place is fantastic. \n\nMy one small nitpick: the menu is in Italian so you'll have to ask your server what each dish is.  I'm sure it's annoying for the servers because it can take some time to explain, so why not just have the menu in English? Again, I'm nitpicking.", "author": "Dave P."}

My partner and I found it through a general Google search of best restaurants to eat while visiting San Francisco and this place caught our attention. When we arrived, we were unaware that the restaurant goes by reservations. No problem though on the evening we went, as Stephanie the hostess was able to accommodate us even though the place was pretty packed. In seating us, she was extremely hospitable by inquiring where we were from, how we had heard about the place and provided some of her menu recommendations. \n\nThe appetizer items that we went with was the Tuna with Moro blood orange & tuna heart bottarga and Brokaw Farm avocado with kumquat & oxalis. I didn't care for the tuna appetizer too much, but the selection was something that my partner was interested in which is why we went with it. She absolutely loved it by the way. For the main course we shared two dishes: the Agnolotti del plin and the Black sea bass with spinach, beet & caper. Let me tell you, both were exquisite! The Agnolotti was al dente, with the meat and sauce complimenting each other perfectly. As for the Black sea bass, the best cooked fish I have ever had mixed with the spinach, beets and capers making each fork of food an experience for the taste buds. And finally, for dessert, we shared the Taggiasca olive oil panna cotta with honeycomb, where I went with a cappuccino and my partner a green tea. From top to bottom, Cotogna provided a great atmosphere, food and dining experience you could ask from a restaurateur!\n\nI know that some of the other reviews contained how it was a little pricey and deducted stars for that. My partner and I are non-drinkers and after the tip it came out to about $75 a person. Not bad at all considering the superior quality of the food and its preparation, the quaint romantic vibe and the location being in San Francisco.

Classic and derricious.  Next, the fig pizza was almost literally paper thin and charred to perfection towards the edges.  Destroyed in minutes and served as a great warm-up to the...\n\nPASTA!  That pumpkin cappelacci was so unique and out of this world - creamy pumpkin filling, but that searing (I think?) on the outside of each piece created flavors of toasted butterscotch, burnt caramel and even nutty notes that could make the dish work even for dessert.  The tagliatelle al ragout Modenese and pappardelle with suckling pig both had more hearty and familiar savory flavors done exceptionally well.  In fact, the latter's consistency rode the very fine line between al dente and fully cooked and stands as the only pasta my fiance and I mutually agreed on in that regard (I prefer them much more al dente than she does).\n\nFor wines, I loved the all-Italian list that consisted almost entirely of affordable bottles of both classic and more obscure varietals.

It was still fairly empty when I got there around noon, but the place was packed by the time we left around 1:30. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple. We got\n\nStrozzapreti cacio e pepe -- such a classic Italian dish.

The orecchiette was delicious, and the little mussels added some nice texture and contrast in flavor -- the sauce was a little on the more tart side, but I thought it was still delicious. Small cauliflower and broccoli florets were also inside the dish. I can't rave enough about how much I loved it\n\nFocaccia -- cause how can you have Italian food without focaccia?! Their focaccia looks a little different from what I'm used to -- it came out as a long strip of bread, but was still very light and delicoius.\n\nVerdure bianchi-- my friend wanted some vegetables with our lunch, so we got this secondi. It was delicious -- a bunch of root vegetables with a milk-based cream sauce that complemented the dish really nicely.\n\nOverall, I was SO impressed with the pasta here and the quality control. Flavors were thoughtful and well executed. The expeditor (I presume) came over and told us that our verdure bianchi was going to take a little longer because the first one wasn't cooked to standard, and tbh, not sure if I am food expert enough to tell the difference, but I really appreciated the transparency that they gave us about our dish. \n\nFinal price was a little over $80 for 2 people, which is definitely pricey for lunch. I found the two pasta and the focaccia to be enough for me, but my guy friend was still pretty hungry... so not sure what the perfect medium in terms of how much food to order is.

Some would call it cozy, I'd say it's crammed for max seating. The restaurant was half full and I could barely have a conversation with my dining companion because our neighbors were so close to us and had a lively conversation.\n\nOnto the food, we had the following courses:\n\n1) salad de nice, which came with some mushy/unidentifiable fish and anchovies, heirloom tomatoes, greens and an egg in a light vinaigrette. The table next to us was offered freshly ground pepper but we were not. Ding #1\n\n2) raviolo di ricotta - interesting pasta but super heavy. One ravioli filled with ricotta and a runny egg  and drenched in brown butter. If you haven't had this elsewhere, I'd recommend you order it; otherwise, skip it - I've had better renditions.\n\n3) corn and chive triangoli - better dish of the two pasta courses.

Instead, we waited for about five minutes and the manager came over explaining what happened. Never once was she apologetic and instead said there must have been \"confusion\" and she didn't know we wanted to pack it home.\n\nHonestly, I could have cared less and would have said, \"Don't worry about it. These things happen.\" However, there was never an apology of any sort so I proceeded with the conversation below:\n\nMe: \"Well, the server never asked if we wanted it packed home.\"\nManager: \"Well, we never ask.\"\n\nYou're an upscale casual restaurant and I literally paid $113 for lunch with a $5 mandate...I wouldn't think it's uncommon to ask for a restaurant of your caliber. I've been to plenty of restaurants...whether it's The French Laundry, Puccino or Delfina or what not, servers have always asked if we wanted to pack home anything. \n\nTo add insult to injury, she then proceeds with:\n\nManager: \"We still have some 'leftover chicken' and we'd love to make it up if you have the time.\"\n\nOkay, why in the world would I want your \"leftover chicken.\" This sounds terrible and not only that but saying that you never ask a customer if they want to take something home is a horrible excuse. Change your policy to avoid confusion! \n\nWe declined her atrocious offer and said don't worry about it and the manager walks away. By now, I'm angry and repulsed that she made such an offer. I signed the bill and we get up to leave.\n\nThe manager comes back...Jesus Christ! What now?! Have you not said enough?\n\nManager: \"We'd like to make it up to you by at least comping your drinks.\"\nMe: \"Don't worry about it.\"\nManager: \"Is there anything else we can do?\"\nMe: \"No.\"\n\nTerrible. Don't even bother asking. You should have offered the comp when we declined your offer to make us \"leftover chicken.\" This just seems like a half hearted attempt to somewhat apologize.\n\nLet me quote figures for you. My husband had some sort of Italian soda and I had a lemonade. Total is at most $12. Tuscan fried chicken was $24. Do the math.\n\nOptically, this is what it seems like, \"It's not entirely our fault so we'll comp you half the cost of the dish.\"\n\nNo thank you. It's not about the cost or the food but more about principle. SF has many restaurants that I don't feel the need to come back and succumb to okay food with horrible service from management. \n\nYou know what would have been a better thing to say in this situation? Let me educate you...\"I'm sorry for the confusion and I'd love to make it up to you by having the kitchen remake an order for you if you have the time.\" No need to use \"leftover chicken\" to make me feel like I'm not worthy of new chicken. This would have easily avoided the entire situation.", "author": "Remus L."}

So I thought, \"Yeah, okay, let's try some Italian tonight.\" We like to do spur of the moment restaurant picks and just walk in and hang our head in shame as we get on the waitlist - or walk like we own the place and get bar seats. We saw LOTS of open seats so we were very excited to walk in. Then, the hostess crushed our dreams by telling us the bar seats, chef's table seats, patio seats, and regular dining room seats all have waitlists on them. So we hung our heads and said we'll get on the waitlist. \n\n10 Minutes Later - Every seat we saw that was open when we walked in is. still. open.\n15 Minutes Later - Now one table is sat and the others are still open.\n20 Minutes Later - Saw a random couple walk in and get the patio seats we were eyeballing. I looked at my phone and they texted. Looks like they forgot who we were. I leaned on the fire hydrant right in front of the glass door so they can see that we're standing there waiting. Oh, and 3 tables that were open when we walked in are STILL OPEN.\n25 Minutes Later - Seated at the chef's table that was OPEN THE WHOLE TIME in front of the fire pit. We said we wanted the patio table clearing out right now. She said she's going to check on them.\n30 Minutes Later - Waiter comes by to drop off menus. We said we were just waiting on the hostess because this area is too warm for me. They said they were going to check with her.\n35 Minutes Later - LMFAO another waitress comes by and we repeated what we said.\n40 Minutes Later - My husband just up and asks the hostess because we were about to turn into brisket from the fire pit.\n45 Minutes Later - Phew! Seated on the patio.\n50 Minutes Later - Waitress comes back and asks what kind of water we'd like. We said tap and then asked for wine glasses because we brought a bottle of wine.\n55 Minutes Later - Nice waiter or possibly sommelier comes by with clean glasses and opened our wine.\n60 Minutes Later - Nothing happened. Because the waitress never came back. \n65 Minutes Later - LMAO. Still nothing. I can't.\n70 Minutes Later - We got our water! Hooray! And ordered everything because so help me if I have to wait even more.\n\nTwo hours later, we were finished. \n\nYou guys, my husband and I eat like we haven't been fed in 3 weeks.

We had told them the dinner was for a birthday so they modified the individual little paper mats to say Happy birthday! It was a cute little touch. Our waitress was great and gave us solid recommendations. We all throughly enjoyed our food. We got an appetizer, bread, two pasta dishes, and the lamb to share (3 people). The wait between the pasta and the meat was a little long so they provided a complimentary appetizer dish and even took the lamb off the check! We definitely weren't expecting that but it was very kind!! We finished off with two desserts, the lemon sherbet- so creamy- and the vanilla cart gelato. So good if you get a little of the lemon and a little of the vanilla on the spoon and eat it that way. The sherbet is sooo sweet that the vanilla balances it out.

Given that we basically just ate different varieties of wheat (noodles, bread) lightly seasoned with cheese, and had two drinks each, it came down to ~$75 per person. The profit margins on this restaurant must be... robust.\n\nBut you know what! They've crafted such an inviting, ideal tavern space and deserve to reap the rewards of it. Their pasta really are made with care. Service was always friendly, and they remembered a birthday request that I'd made. So thank you for a good night, Cotogna!", "author": "Ken H."}

The best part by far was the outstanding service we received and the antipasto. \n\nKelly our server and the manager Alexandra deserve a 5 star. The burrata and the smoked trout antipasto... woah. So good. The smoked salmon plate is like big, deconstructed caviar bite with the mascarpone and potatoes and Meyer lemon. Incredible and beautiful dish. Kelly recommended some great Italian whites we've never tried which tied everything together. \n\nWhen we had an issue with our two pastas, the amatriciana and the ricotta raviolo, Kelly let Alexandra know and they immediately took care of it like a 5 star restaurant should. They even gave us a couple of glasses of wine to make up for it. We couldn't ask for better or more appreciative service. \n\nThe amatriciana was too oily and the guanciale was overcooked to be way too crunchy. 2 star. The raviolo was blanketed with a thick coat of Parmesan and it detracted from the dish with the sharp cheese flavor. Ricotta raviolo is supposed to be a softer, sweeter flavor. 2 or 3 star. When we voiced our love of the other pastas they used to have on the menu like the cacio e Pepe or the tagliatelle, and mentioned how we love quince and have been coming for years, they immediately rectified everything. Couldn't ask for better service.", "author": "Matt C."}

We planned on another restaurant but I noticed 2 days prior Cotogna miraculously had an open reservation for 5:30.  You bet your ass that we took it!  I've been wanting to try them for years after hearing all the hype; and I know she loves this place, plus her bf usually doesn't care for pricey Italian places too much.  So win win for both of us.\n\nFirst glance at the menu, I said to her, how come in Rome and Florence I can get English menus but here everything's in Italian?!  She replied back, \"Authenticity here?\"  Needless to say, I had to have the waitress translate all the pasta dishes.  Despite being full from a dessert at work prior, I managed to share with her: the renowned ricotta crostini appetizer, the crab pasta (taglirini con granchio), and spit roasted pork.\n\nThe tables were very close to each other, and I had two bags with me plus my jacket.  Under the table hooks would have been great here.  However they did do a good job of spacing out the reservations.  When we got to our table, a woman was finishing up to the table to our left, and when we were finishing a woman at the table to our right had been just seated.\n\nThe warm ricotta in a stone pot was odd, but it worked.  The heat made the homemade ricotta even creamier and with the bit of honey drizzled on top (DIY) it was wonderful.  I don't think the fig leaf in the pot made any difference though.  I wish they had kept it with the mushrooms which everyone seemed to have pics of on here.  There was a bit of a wait until our pasta came out, but it was worth it.  The taglirini was perfectly al dente and coated in a light olive oil sauce with a hint of spiciness and garlic.  They also gave plenty of finely shredded crab meat.  Last but not least, we had to muster up the ability to finish the pork.  I was expecting the pork to be like a porchetta loin, instead it was more of a pork chop served with some peppers and sweet onions.  The meat was nice and juicy with some fat to keep it moist.  No crisp skin like I was craving though.  Wish they also gave a little more veggies than a garnish of radishes, peppers and onions.  Janice, got a drink, and I just stuck with water.  Our total for all of that, before tip, was about $86.  It's a little bit of a splurge, slightly smaller portions, but still not obscenly pricey and still very delicious.   \n\nSince the tables are close together and it gets pretty loud, I wouldn't recommend this place for a date night or at least a newer couple.  The Service was very attentive, however, I think our waitress was anxious to turn the table over, or just to help out, as she took away our ricotta even when there was still a little left.  And when I said we'd like to keep the pasta (while the pork was coming out next), she took it away, until another waitress stopped her from walking back to the kitchen.  All in all, Cotogna is worth the praise it gets, and I want to take hubby here sometime.  It's in the Jackson Square area (cusp of FiDi and North Beach, about a block away from Broadway); parking is tight so BART it and walk it or Lyft/Uber it is recommended.  They don't close in between lunch and dinner on weeknights, so if you don't have a rezzie, try stopping in at an off time.", "author": "Cat C."}

After talking to the manager, they made it work and got us a table after about 20 minutes.

Nice dish if your love 'shroms.\n\nTagliatelle al Ragout Modenese with Oxtail - a heartier pasta dish with an oxtail ragout.  So delicious!\n\nRavioli di Agnello - Not your typical shaped raviolis. These were tube shaped filled with lamb in a light sauce.\n\nSuckling Pig - slices of grilled pork with green onions and greens.  Pork was so tender and moist.  Just don't be put off by the name.\n\nHazelnut Torta - a light cake that was not overly sweet. Perfect ending to a delicious meal.\n\nThis was not your traditional Italian meal.

Trust me, you won't be disappointed.  After forwarding to an aunt, she took my uncle to try their duck confit one week in March and, unable to score anything more than a table for two, invited me to try the ensuing supper menu.  Parking is a breeze in the Financial District normally Sundays so we waited a few minutes for the restaurant to open around 5 pm.  Once seated, things really get simple.  The menu is your place mat, though there are some other regular menu items available.  Here's what we had for this four course meal:\n\n1.  English pea and mint croquettes (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=EPleyZ0eg3EiMlAzC1FcbA) - Think super sized tater tots with in season English peas and a subtle mint flavor.  Garnished with pickled in season green strawberry.\n\n2.  Tortelli di carbonara (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=kqHbe6KUf_uLUJH8IVOeiA) - My aunt touted this and have to say one of the best pasta pockets I've had in a rich carbonara sauce.\n\n3.  Watson Farm spring lamb, share plate  (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=kqHbe6KUf_uLUJH8IVOeiA) - A mix of tenderloin and sausages, aunt touted \"best lamb she's had\"!  Served family style with artichokes Alla Romana, Riverdog Farms purple carrots, and marjoram.  We couldn't finish so my uncle and cousin were able to enjoy this at home.\n\n4.  Lemon - extra virgin olive oil sorbetti (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=SQL) - Light ending to a rustic meal, nicely garnished Dirty Girl Farm strawberries and almond vanilla shortbread.  My host was a bit tipsy and sprinkled her grappa pairing on mine so can't really detail the flavors well.  \n\nWhen we finished, my eyes had a bit of a glazed look.  How such a 'simple' meal can be so amazing!  My thoughts repeated Vince Vaughn's words in \" The Internship\", Farm to table, F to T baby!\".  The dining room was pretty much full by the time we left. My host struck a conversation with three gentlemen at our neighboring table who hailed from Austria.  Obviously, someone did their homework in referring them to dine here.  Curious about the cooking of the lamb, we walked by the kitchen oven to peer at how it was cooked.  Though I've never been to Europe, this is exactly how I'd imagine dining there.

No? Well, that's my reason why it's taken me so long to come here for dinner. In any case, in checking out the newly released 7x7 The Big Eat List, Cotogna's still on there, so my husband and I decided to check out on a Tuesday night. For a Tuesday night, Cotogna is POPPIN. There were big groups, date nights, and walk-ins coming through while we were there and it's easy to see why.  In perusing over the menu, we decided to go with the following:\n\nAppetizers/Small Plates:\nWild mushrooms sformato & Montasio D.O.P.: I don't know if I've ever had a proper sformato before, but this was a fabulous way to try it. Not sure what a sformato is? It's basically a savoury custard. The wild mushrooms on this were absolutely delicious!\n\nPastas:\nRaviolo di ricotta: Yes it's one raviolo, but it's one GIANT and super rich raviolo.  The whole egg with the ricotta is absolutely delicious and the brown butter sauce that is in makes this a super rich dish all together.\nGnocchi con Castelmagno e nocciole: Just like everything else that's served up at Cotogna, this is gnocchi dish was definitely very rich where it was swimming in a delicious cream-based sauce.  The gnocchi were perfect little pillows of happiness and I would definitely go with this if you're a fan.\nAgnolotti del plin con sugo d'arrosto: Cotogna saves the best for last and this absolutely did not disappoint.  Having had agnolotti with a pork-based filling is something I know I've had at a number of places, but this was easily the best agnolotti dish I've had to date.  Greg proclaimed this the best thing he's had this year so far, which is a pretty bold statement since we've had some really great things. In any case, I hope this stays on the menu - it's worth coming back just for this!\n\nService wise, our server was nice, but food seemed to come out a little on the slow side.  Understanding that the place was packed, it just seemed like we were waiting a little too long for our food to come out.  That aside, what was lacking in service was made up in food.  I definitely will be back here to try out a few more items, especially the pizze and the roasted chicken (which takes an hour to cook!).", "author": "Lisa I."}

Broccoli instead of eggplant, Mozzarella instead of Grana Padano, etc).\n\nThe more basic items here, like pizza, are good, but not good enough for this price point.

It was oniony, cheesy and perfect. \n\nRaviolo di ricotta - OMG. So. Good. One of us we're going to order this as an entree but decided to share amongst 5 of us. That was the best idea bc there would be no way one person could eat this on their own. It is super rich and decadent. The ravioli was filled w ricotta and when you cut into it the egg oozed out. was topped with this amazing sharp parm - highly recommend ordering this!!! \n\nFocaccia for the table - was good to soak up ravioli sauce. \n\nThe Sunday supper pasta dish was a tagliette with a creamy lemon sauce and scallops/crab. Two of us ordered this and it was light and tasty. \n\nWe got the tagliette with ragu and the pappardelle with boar ragu - both tasted pretty similar in terms\nOf sauce. Both were amazing. \n\nPumpkin cappellacci - pretty tasty, a good seasonal pasta dish. I'd prop pick the other pastas over this one. \n\nDessert: we got the Meyer lemon budino & Bigne di San Giuseppe. The budino was ok, the bigne was like a giant cream puff/cannoli mix and was tasty. \n\nWine: I asked our waitress for a wine suggestion and I told her I wanted the smoothest red. She pointed out 2 of them and I choose the first one, trusting her judgment. Was definitely a very bold, full bodied wine and wasn't smooth. Regardless I still drank the wine. \n\nNow onto service....our waitress was not the friendliest/attentive. Not once did she come to our table to ask how our food was during the 2 hrs we dined. We saw her checking on the table sitting next to us though. When we got our pasta, we asked if we could get some bread, as we like to dip it into our sauce. She replied \"we don't have bread, just the focaccia appetizer\". We saw the table next to us ask for bread when they were eating salads and it was brought out to them and pointed that out to her. Her response was that it was crostini which was different than bread. We said we still wanted it and she literally looked SO angry that we would want to order it... took 10 minutes to come out, no exaggeration. Our pasta was getting cold as we were waiting for the bread to come out. When we saw our neighbors request it, it came to them within minutes. Also it took her a while to get cheese for our pasta and to order dessert towards the end. Pretty disappointed on awful service.", "author": "Samantha G."}

Immediately sat at the bar and ordered from the Sunday Night Dinner menu (basically you get more or less one choice of meal on Sundays). This was a four course dinner for $55: fava bean and fennel salad, tagliatelle pasta with Artichokes, Roast boned leg of Lamb Abruzzi style, and Cheesecake with ricotta, strawberries and blueberries.\n\nMade the mistake of ordering a glass of wine rather than the add on of $35 for the tasting wine that would go with the meal. Probably spent more on 3 glasses of wine than I would have if I had got the 4 with dinner (though maybe the pours are smaller with the dinner option?)\n\nService was excellent at the bar and I really liked the bartender.\n\nFava bean salad was nice though not extraordinary. Pasta was pretty tasty (housemade I believe) and a lot of it, maybe even a bit too much but I can't really complain about that. The lamb was plentiful and tasty.\n\nUnfortunately the service went downhill pretty quick after I finished off my lamb. Empty wine glass, empty water glass, no coffee or anything offered and the dessert came and went. It was tasty but I was thirsty (and actually the cheesecake crust was sort of hard as a rock). Main problem here was the bartender was making fancy drinks for the entire restaurant, messing with checks, taking orders and he was just too busy at this point to provide the level of service he had previously. However, I can't necessarily blame him but it made the end of a pretty good meal a bit of a bummer. Otherwise he was excellent.", "author": "Tommy G."}

The runaway favorites of the night were the Brussels sprouts au gratin (even the sprouts haters LOVED it!), tortelli with pumpkin and squash as well as the pine nut and pomegranate tart. I do recommend the focaccia over the country loaf, based on the intense and delicious flavor of the focaccia. \n\nOverall, a fabulous dinner made even better by the warm atmosphere and kindness of the staff.

A good Italian restaurant trying to pass itself off as a Michelin type restaurant. Sure the rustic atmosphere with warm wood-fired ovens and a lively bar set a great scene, but that ambiance is quickly tempered by the quality and quantity of the food.\n\nOur waitress was pleasant, the wine list abundant and reasonably priced ($50 each). Unlike every Italian restaurant I've ever been to, bread is not provided complimentary, but rather focaccia is available at a $4 charge. We shared a pizza among a table of 5 that served as an excellent appetizer. The combination of dates and goat cheese was delicate yet flavorful and the crust was perfectly cooked. \n\nMy biggest gripe with Cotogna was the portion sizes. All of the entrees were not suitably sized for a main course at an Italian restaurant. Despite the name, the paccheri with king crab was not fit for a king but rather only for a young prince. There were maybe a dozen pieces of pasta with a few shreds of crab. Overall, the dish lacked flavor in the sauce despite the menu's promise of spicy pepper. The sole was well-prepared but once again inadequately sized. The highlight of the main courses was the gnocchi which had an excellent, soft, fluffy texture and was served with a honey-based sauce. We did not order dessert since nothing on the menu jumped out at us. \n\nFor a party of five with wine the bill came to $265 with tip: a price worth paying for a higher quality restaurant or a place where you leave feeling full.

The theme ingredient of the weekend was 'rice' and the chef presented various iterations throughout the night.\n\nThe first course was a modern chirashi; black rice topped with red snapper sashimi and edible flowers.  The dish was refreshing, with a touch of acid to keep it bright.  The second dish was a classic risotto.  No complaints, it was creamy and flawlessly executed.  For the main dish, we opted for the duck served alongside pan jus.  Our server mentioned the elaborate curing process to reach the right balance of saltiness.   The breast meat was tender, but the real treat was the fall-off-the-bone leg meat (cooked to perfection via confit method).  It was probably one of the best duck dishes i've ever had.  \n\nThe meal ended with 2 arancinis drizzled with dulce de leche and plum.  The small beignet-like rice doughnuts were just enough to satisfy that sweet tooth at the end of the meal.  \n\nOverall, I was impressed by the creative execution of their theme, the freshly procured ingredients and the service provided by the staff.

While I appreciated the transparency, it didn't really excuse how long we waited (at this point it was another 30 minutes until we received our food) or that they didn't do anything to ease our wait. I'm not saying I need a hand out but if you're big enough to step up and say \"hey we screwed up\" you have to follow that up with some sort of gesture, and not just leave use hanging and hungry for 30 more minutes. \n\nOther than that the food was great.

It all started with the slowest service I've ever had (\"wonderful\"). On top of that we were lied to, yes lied to (\"wonderful\")!  It took 45 minutes to get our sliced prosciutto, then another 15 for the pasta course.

After mentioning to a passer by-er that the fish was over salted, I was offered a spicy sauce for my fried chicken. \"Sure, I would love some!\"  It was brought over in a FLASH and was a great homemade \"wing sauce\" in the cutest little mini bottle (\"wonderful\").  I immediately asked if I could purchase the mini bottle or get one for take away.  \"No, we don't give these away or sell them but I can get you a side.\"  hm, ok.

I walked in right after an older lady who didn't have reservations. The hostess told her it was probably better to go elsewhere since all the reservations were full and there were no spots at the bar for 2 people. The bar seemed full, but figured there was no harm in asking. The hostess asked another lady who had her bag and items on a chair if she was saving it for someone and she wasn't! I was able to be seated right away and had an amazing meal to follow. She also appeared to be a regular and was able to give me some good suggestions for next time. \n\nI started with Dorothy's Distraction (Rye, Pimms, Lemon, Grand Poppy, and Honey) which was so delicious. I love Pimms. Whenever I see it, I do try and get it; most of the time it's paired with items nice and sweet. I ordered the focaccia rolls. They were delicious little balls of carbs that I just wanted to eat all the time. So delicious, but I had a much more important dish to eat - the \"ravioli di ricotta\". It's this large single piece of ravioli with and soft egg yolk and tons of ricotta cheese and parmesan on top. Honestly, there was a little too much parmesan for me on top, but still, it was delicious. So good - I would go back just to have that dish again. \n\nOverall, great service, great food - what more can you really ask for? \n\nProtip: get there early to get bar seating or get lucky.

A little wetter, a little more rubbery, and a bit more tart. Not bad, but not nearly as enjoyable as burrata I've had in the past.\n\n* Agnolotti del plin con sugo d'arrosto - Mini ravioli, almost, filled with a mixture of ground pork and veal, if I remember correctly. Flavor wise, it wasn't bad, but the grittiness of the filling was a little offsetting, and making the dish a bit less enjoyable than it could have been.\n\n* Almond Tart - This was actually my lunch partner's choice, as I had been eying two other items on the menu instead. Enjoyable, and tasty even, if you enjoy drier, denser style cakes. Being a fan of quesadilla salvadore\u00f1a, I was a fan, but my lunch partner was not as much.\n\nNormally, I wouldn't try a place I'd given two stars another try, but seeing as a friend whose opinion on food I highly agree with give this place rave reviews, I'm inclined to give them a second chance, some time in the future, and this time, stick to one of their noodle based pastas.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - A pretty decently sized restaurant, with plenty of space between tables, so accessibility should be fine.

And if their list is not extensive enough, they will share with you Quinces' wine list from next door ( a 3 star Michelin restaurant). Dessert was Meyer lemon budino. Wonderful!

It wasn't bad since we just took a walk around North Beach and came back with empty stomaches, ready for a really satisfying meal. \n\nI ordered a glass of the Vittoria Frappato to start - it was a nice, light, semi-sweet red wine. To eat, we ordered the Black trumpet mushroom, raschera & kale pizza and the Raviolo di ricotta. The pizza came out first and it was a white pie with delicious flavors of mushrooms and kale in addition to the unique cheese which was a nice addition to the taste. We quickly finished the entire pizza, eagerly waiting for the raviolo. The raviolo was one giant piece of pasta filled with a farm fresh egg and cheese. I was very skeptical of this dish in the beginning, but taking one bite, I was immediately hooked. The texture of the pasta was cooked just right and the egg was not too runny to make a huge mess. It was so delicious and I would definitely be back to eat another one. Definitely recommend both these dishes! \n\nWe weren't done yet, we had to try one of their many desserts as well.

I believe Cotogna has shifted into auto-pilot.  Was there for Sunday Supper last night with wine pairing.  Tables along window less than 12\" apart - so close together that servers could not reach plates/glasses without literally bumping/brushing up against me as they served/cleared/refilled.  Party seated next to the entry asked to be moved - so did the table next to them.  Simply uncomfortable.  Plus we had a wobbly table.  (And it's so dim inside that literally every table had to use the flashlight app on their phone to read the menu - do you know how annoyingly bright those lights are when folks all around you are using them to read?).\n\nThe kitchen clearly had problems last night.  After our first course (bread soup), and while our bowls had not yet been cleared, we were brought ANOTHER serving before the confused help asked us if we had already been served our first course?!\n\nThen a 20+ minute delay before the second (pasta) course was served?!  And after being served course #2, we had literally within two minutes help circling like sharks checking every 30 seconds to see if we had finished the course.\n\nThen our main course came out and we sat around for several minutes waiting to be brought the wine pour to be 'paired' with that course.  Service failure.\n\nSame failure happened with dessert course.  Our server was incapable of pouring a glass of wine at about the same time as each course emerged from the kitchen.  Very poor form.\n\nAs for the food itself - it was hit and miss.  The soup and pasta courses were good.  Entree course of veal/pork meatballs was poor - cooked too long causing several of them to dry-out to the point several had an inedible half-inch thick hard crust.  Dessert (olive oil cake) was uninspired.\n\nBottom-line:  the place is now just a cash cow relying  on it's name and longevity.

Probably, the best thin gourmet pizza I have had in 5 years.\n\nAlaskan Halibut with Morels; the fish was cooked perfectly and had great flavor. \n\n$24 Set meal of Garlic Potato Soup, Lamb Pasta, Strawberry ice cream desert.\n\nThe Ambiance is very good with the restaurant full people enjoying the evening and their meals.\n\nWith one exception good food, great wine with great friend. \n\nThe not so positive:\n\nThe Lamb Pasta. The flavor was OK but the texture of the lamb was bad. The lamb was braised or however cooked into stringy strands and was in several blobs around the pasta. Then it was masked and covered in cheese. see pics. \n\ncorkage fee $25", "author": "George F."}

That's about it though.\n\nI sat at the chef's counter and was intrigued by the chop salads that weren't on the menu.  I asked for one and the server said \"Let me check.\"  Within earshot of me, the server asked the cook and manager in the back if I could have one.  They asked \"Is it for a red guest?\"  The server said I wasn't and the Cotogna team deemed me ineligible to receive the chop salad.  As I was leaving, I asked a different server if \"Red Guest\" meant VIP and they said it did.  I'm not important enough to get a salad here? As my meal progressed, I watched 3 more chop salads leave the kitchen.\n\nThis place must be an amazing experience if you're a \"Red Guest\" but for normal folks like me, not so much.

We started with an anchovy Caesar salad that I was a little afraid of as there were anchovies two inches long on my plate. All it took was one bite. This was one of the best Caesar salads I've ever had. \n\nWe shared two pastas: the gnocchi with lemon, thyme and mustard greens. And a lamb agnolotti that was a special. The gnocchi was perfect. Pillowy, soft, tender, simple and delicious. One of those beautiful dishes where each ingredient really shines through. \n\nThe lamb failed us. I knew it from the moment it arrived at the table. A lack of sauce and a gritty, grassy flavor made this hard to eat. I chose poorly, for my fate and the fate of the poor little lamb. \n\nWe shared a Wolf Ranch quail 'al mattone,' which means under a brick. This quail was moist and tender and fell apart with the touch of my fork. I wish it was a larger bird because I wanted more of it! \n\nSave for the lamb pasta, everything about this meal was spectacular. Service was friendly and helpful, wine was excellent and food really memorable. \n\nDefinitely a spot I will return to when in San Francisco!", "author": "Brittany F."}

The restaurant was loud and the tables close together - it may have been harder if there were more than two of us trying to make conversation. Based on recommendations from the waitress, we ordered a salad to start (avocado, beets, and quinoa), two pastas, and a meat course. \n\nThe salad was very good - we live on the east coast and the avocados here really do seem measurably better. We really liked the crunchy quinoa topping and how it contrasted with the other textures in the salad - we eat a lot of quinoa but have never used it like that. One of the pastas was a daily special - strichetti with pesto - that was good but not that notable. We have made pasta and make pesto all the time - I was a little bummed since the waitress seemed to suggest it was very special. The other pasta, however, was AMAZING - the agnolotti del plin con sugo d'arrosto. I would have eaten like 3 orders of it by myself if I could - savory and juicy and perfect. We also had the grilled lamb dish, which was also really wonderful - perfectly cooked, with delicious sauce and mushrooms.

It was a Sangiovese/ Cabernet and it was really really good. One of the better wines i've ever had at dinner.\n\nFood: The food was what made me disappointed. We started with the brussel sprouts appetizer which was delicious! (5/5). It was covered in a creamy sauce and perfectly browned. Then we got the bufalo mozarella with crostini which was a HUGE disappointment (1/5). It was $21 and nothing special at all. Very little flavor and very little food. If it had been amazing burrata it might have been worth it, but it was not. Then we got two pastas- I really liked the cacio e pepe (4/5). It was creamy and flavorful and I could tell the pasta was homemade. We also got the Agnolotti del plin con sugo d'arrosto which was a ravioli with rabbit, veal, and pork (or beef, I can't remember). I could tell that it was very fresh, but I really didn't like the combination of meats. I give it a (3/5) because I could tell that it was high quality, even though I didn't like the flavors. My boyfriend liked it though, but didn't think it was amazing.\n\nOverall: I would probably come back if someone else wanted to and try the pizza and get the brussel sprouts and cacio e pepe pasta again, but it was a very expensive meal for half of it being mediocre.", "author": "Jenna G."}

It's served as one narrow slice, served on a thin layer of olive oil, and topped with some spices.\n\n* Raviolo: The raviolo reminds me of the one at Seven Hills. It's so creamy, rich, and buttery. Although it was small, it was my favorite of the 2 pastas we ordered.\n\n* Agnolotti: Agnolotti is like a mini tortellini or pasta pouch filled with 3 kinds of meats. I ended up dipping my agnoloti's in the leftover raviolo brown butter sauce. Nom.\n\n* Proscuitto Arugula Pizza: A great neopolitan style pizza, chewy and crusty and I didn't find it overly soggy like some others complained. It's more similar to Cupola in style (thin crust and chewy), and they brush the crust with oil to get it crispy. The toppings were clearly top tier, I loved the proscuitto even though it was tad gamey.\n\n* Porchetta: The famed porchetta really does have an extremely crispy skin, it was so crispy I couldn't even cut it was a steak knife! The meat was juicy and flavorful, and includes a pretty substantial piece of pure fat, so for the price it wasn't worth but the leaner parts were perfect.\n\n* Brussels Sprouts: Skip, crusty on the outside but too cooked on the inside.

Everything we had was extremely tasty and delicately prepared. Only reason that I didn't give a 5-star was because there could have been more refinement.\n\nWe couldn't resist and got 2 appetizers to share: prosciutto with grilled apricot and the octopus appetizer we heard so much about. The prosciutto dish was simple - with just some arugula, olive oil, and the grilled apricot. I liked that there were plenty of big pieces of prosciutto. The apricot was unexpectedly tart. I wish it was a little less tart and more on the sweet side, which I think would go better with the salty prosciutto.\n\nThe octopus was marinated and then grilled to tenderness, served with some roasted haricot vert and baby carrots. The dish was extremely simple and did not have a complex flavor profile. The star was the octopus and it shined. It was cooked enough that it lost its normally chewy texture, but wasn't overcooked such that it fell apart. I wish it was a little more seasoned to bring all the ingredients together.\n\nWe got the papardelle with rabbit and the swordfish with caponata as entrees. Both were delicious, but lacked perfection. The papardelle was very savory and the rabbit flavor definitely came through. But there were olives in the sauce and they were extremely salty. That really overpowered everything else. The swordfish was a little on the tough side - indication that it was slightly overcooked. But the eggplant caponata was amazing - such good flavor and texture.\n\nLastly we ended the meal with the peach tart. Given how much we had eaten, we were glad the tart was on the small side. The peaches, like the apricots, were on the tart side, which I was a little disappointed by. Dessert should be sweet. I think it were sweeter, it would've gone better with the mascarpone ice cream.\n\nAll in all, it was a very satisfying meal.", "author": "Sherry L."}

I mean it is the sister restaurant of quince and a Michael tusk establishment how can you go wrong? The drinks were amazing and colorful. I mean we feast with our eyes first right haha. Every dish was definitely Instagram worthy plates lol. The presentation of each dish was impeccable. We were seated by the brick oven so we got a show and dinner. We were able to watch a lot of pizzas being tossed and certain preparations of what we had ordered. The staff was amazing I swear my glass of water was filled after every sip now that's what I call attentive. To be perfectly honest, this is one of those places where every dish is going to be spectacular. Just order everything haha!!! The quail and pizza were definitely the most memorable dishes of the night. It was cooked to perfection. The seasoning was on point, the quail was moist and tender. It was like it came out of food heaven haha. Then there was the buratta and ricotta dishes!!! Oh my goodness just thinking about it makes me wants to dine here again. I mean all I have to say is buratta and you know that dish is going to be bomb! The ricotta definitely gave the buratta dish a run for its money cause that was off the hook too lol.

So, everything was going well at our 2 seats at the pizza counter and our ravioli came out first, it was so glorious that and I took a picture of it. After a long while our other food didn't arrive so I looked at the time stamp on the ravioli photo, it was 6:11 pm when I took the first picture and I'd already finished my second glass of Rose. It was 6:45 and our other two dishes were nowhere in sight and other tables around us who were sat after were getting served dishes. I made eye contact with our server and she came over to us, I stated that it had been a while on the food and asked her to check. She came back and stated she was told it would be 4 minutes. The manager came over in the mean time and apologized and gave me another half glass of wine. After it had been almost ten minutes since the waitress checked on the food sovwe got up and asked to speak to the manager again because it is completely unacceptable to wait close to an hour for two small and simple pasta dishes. The manager, Alexandra, took full responsibility and only charged us for the wine and boxed up our dishes that were delivered to our empty seats as we stood at the hostess stand. We had high hopes for this restaurant and it was our first time there but I'm not so sure we will EVER be back since we were clearly forgotten about and the server obviously forgot to order our other dishes or at minimum, check to see why it was taking so long. The food was fantastic so if the service is normally good then I would recommend to try it.", "author": "Elizabeth B."}

Reminds me of the bread they have in Germany. I would just buy the bread if they sold it separately (perhaps they do, I need to find out!!!)\n\nNow the not so good: The menu. I speak decent restaurant Italian, but couldn't understand anything on the menu. The server rattled off a bunch of stuff that was difficult to understand. We ordered the \"Agnolotti del plin con sugo d'arrosto\" (see what I mean??? Agnolotti is a fancy word for Ravioli) and the Pizza: \"Ancho pepper, corn & fior di latte\" WTH is \"fior di latte\" you might ask. Well it's good old mozzarella from cows milk. But Mozzarella is apparently not a fancy enough word, so they go with \"fior di latte\"\n\nThe \"Agnolotti\" it's really tortellini if you ask me, tasted more like something that I may feed to my 7 year old Schnauzer, but even he might be skeptical.. It just didn't do it for me. The whole pretentious menu, the rather unusual dishes, me thinking I'm eating food that smells like what I give to Rusty... Perhaps I'm just not fancy enough, and perhaps this says more about me than about the restaurant. But it just didn't do it for me. And oh, the portions. The Ravioli were the tiniest portion of pasta I have had in my life (the kids portion at my usual Italian is about 3 times as big). Luckily they did have the super yummy bread....\n\nService was ok.

I love italian food and i've only heard the best things about this restaurant. I think our chef really did just make a mistake but didn't own up to it. I came here with my team of 9 and we sat at the chef's table and got the \"pre fixe family style menu.\" One of my foodie friends said the steak here is the \"best steak he's had in sf\" so of course we went with that as the main course. \n\nWe started off with some cocktails, wine and a salad appetizer. These were all great. I got the bartender's choice as my cocktail and they made one perfect for me based on my preferences! \n\nThe reason why I can't justify giving Cotogna a higher rating is because our steaks came out COMPLETELY UNSEASONED! We had to ask for salt and pepper and manually spray it on the steak ourselves! That completely ruined our dinner experience. Luckily the company more than made up for it, but I could tell the steak had a lot of potential had it been seasoned. \n\nWe told our waitress several times that the steak wasn't seasoned, but instead of taking it back ( although...we had already waited quite some time for these to come out so we were hungry enough to just eat what was in front of us) she gave us the salt and pepper... I guess that's just not what I expected. We asked her to tell the chef and no where in our dining experience did we get an apology for the mistake. =( \n\nFor the amount we paid for the meal I think Cotogna could've done so much more. I really hope this is a one-off case and I really hope we just got unlucky, but based on my experience here tonight. I think it really does fit a 2-star experience. \n\nso sad. i was so excited for the \"best steak in the city.\" I guess it's just not here at cotogna =(", "author": "Annie Z."}

Clever or weird, I haven't decided yet :) Part (all?) of the kitchen space is shared and you can look through to Quince on the way to the facilities in back.\n\nAll wines are a reasonable $40 a bottle (ok, they do have a reserve list if you're feeling spendy).\n\nWe split the Sea Urchin antipasti, Burrata with Grilled Bread, and Goat Cheese & Artichoke Pizza.\n\nThe Sea Urchin (w/ cauliflower, kumquat & golden cayenne $12 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=1uu9x2A3iDPAn_VOkJ1APw#1uu9x2A3iDPAn_VOkJ1APw) was great. The cauliflower was a puree under the sea urchin and the kumquat gave the bite a nice acidity. I didn't get much from the goldne cayenne, which I could see sprinkled on top.\n\nThe Burrata (w/ grilled bread & wild ramps $14 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=hgOA1snSpxlOS8EDCVfHaA#hgOA1snSpxlOS8EDCVfHaA) was good, but not amazing. I did like the pickled ramps and the cheese was good, but not as creamy and rich as some I've had (Riva Cucina).\n\nThe pizza was excellent. We got it 1/2 with the prosciutto and 1/2 without (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=92BKY9q7By-5IXLVT4444A#92BKY9q7By-5IXLVT4444A).

One bite had some kick to it (maybe stray hot pepper which was listed for the asparagus pizza?) which I liked.\n\nFor mains, two folks got the gnocchi, two got the ribs, and I got the lamb chops.\n\nHoping for porchetta, but got the Lamb Chops \"Scottaditto\" which I was told meant they were not \"Frenched\" so the meat and fat extended the length of the bone ($25 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=HsMxnKZS_6pkKE4O4ytn8w#HsMxnKZS_6pkKE4O4ytn8w). Three chops of varying thickness. I ordered these rare and, surprisingly, it was the thickest of the three that was the most cooked at more medium to medium-well. Still, I enjoyed the tender, juicy meat though I was jealous of serving size of the ribs compared to my 3 small chops.\n\nTuscan Pork Ribs (w/ cannellini beans & rosemary $20 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=Q4QafO-fEgov8dLuE_KUYg#Q4QafO-fEgov8dLuE_KUYg) were a full rack of 12 ribs. Well cooked and tender; they easily released from the bone. There was a sprig of rosemary on the serving board, but I found the spicing of the ribs to be lacking and not very \"Tuscan.\" Others liked them just fine.\n\nThe Gnocchi (w/ zucchini, burrata & squash blossoms $17 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=Hum5Ji6KdNFmoMIordFmMw#Hum5Ji6KdNFmoMIordFmMw) was delicious, but very low on squash blossoms.

Ideal reservations are so hard to come by, and i was so excited to finally dine here. I've had my fair share of dining at italian restaurants in SF (which includes Nopa & Flour + Water), which i believe tops cotogna. I agree with much of what other yelpers mention. I felt the food was a bit on the oily side, and i left full (but gross at the same time). And i usually never leave a \"finer\" restaurant feeling this way. \n\nThe menu is pretty limited, and the menu unless you can read italian, some of the items are hard to figure out. The waitress wasn't very friendly nor helpful. And i agree that the tables are too close to each other. You're practically dining with the people next to you and you can hear everyone's conversation. The clientele appears to by business and the \"rich & fancy\" from what I gather overhearing conversations in tables close by. But that may bc we had reservations at 5:45pm. \n\nWe ordered the crudo to begin, tasted bland...the grapefruit and radish had more flavor then the actual fish. The tagliolini tasted too \"al dente\" and the shrimp i felt was a bit fishy. Needless to say, i was disappointed. Next was the smoked trout and leek pizza. It was probably the best dish of the night, but still...the pizza was too doughy, it was hard to cut into. Lastly, came the oily deep fried soft shell crab. It was actually quite big portion (it came with 2 crabs). I didn't have the stomach for dessert. \n\nI should've ordered the $24 pre-fix menu that made it on the 7x7 big eat list 2012.

They change it every week according to what is in season, and they will send you an email with the updated Sunday menu each week if you sign up for their newsletter - it makes me hungry every time!  \n\nTonight's menu was:\n* Chilled Full Belly Farm Melon Soup with Persian cucumber, sea bean & mint (cool, super refreshing, loved the melon in combo with the mint, mmm) \n* Artichoke Triangoli Charred tomato, cranberry beans & opal basil (loved the light buttery sauce, mmm artichoke)\n*  Charcoal Grilled Young Chicken with Smoked eggplant, sweet corn & gypsy peppers (great flavoring, chicken was super tender, loved the smoked eggplant)\n* Robiola due Latti with Sheep & cow's milk cheese from Piedmont, Italy (an added course if you like for an extra $8, like small little bread crackers with soft, warm yummy cheese and tiny bunch of teeny grapes - niiiice)\n*  Black Mission Fig Crostata with Pinenut crunch & rosemary creama (definitely a hit at our table, yummmmmmmmmmm, nice combo with the pinenuts, mmmm)\n\nTheir Sunday menu is filling and proportioned just right.  We loved everything on the menu as it was well thought out and the flavors from each dish complimented the next.  Service was great and while we chatted, the courses would arrive in a timely manner that gave us just enough time to digest a little and ready for the next.\n\nI would highly recommend Cotogna's Sunday supper!  I love their normal menu too, but this menu is an extra treat because you don't have to think, all the choices are made for you, and it is all orchestrated so well (even with accompanied wine tastings if you like) to flow throughout your entire meal.

The burrata was just what burrata should taste like as well. I tried the pesto potato pizza too - FRESHLY ground pesto with strong bold flavored where you can still taste the pine nuts, garlic, cheese, and the basil. Full of flavor!

We had reservations for an early seating, so we didn't have to wait, however, we overheard the hosts tell the 2 ladies after us that without a reservation, a seat at the bar could be a 2 hour wait. \n\nWe first ordered drinks and the complimentary foccacia bread that other yelpers said to ask for. The Smoke and Mirrors drink was my absolute favorite cocktail during my whole trip to SFO. The smoky mezcal with a little grapefruit and chili to balance the flavors was divine! \n\nHere's a break down of what we ate.\n\nAppetizers:\n- Monterey Bay Squid - tender, but the flavor was not outstanding. \n\n- Prosciutto di Parma - excellent! and addicting.\n\nPastas:\n- The raviolo (singular for ravioli) di ricotta, really was delicious and creamy as the other yelpers have said. The farm egg inside the raviolo makes it fun to cut into. The orange yolk gushing out is quite the novelty. Everyone was amazed!\n\n- Agnolotti dal plin - delicious bites of meaty flavor in pinched pasta folds, for lack of a better way to describe agnolotti.\n\n- Saffron pappardelle with lamb and taggiasche olives was possibly my favorite, but it's hard to say for sure, since everything was so delicious. I liked the wide flat pasta, cooked al dente, with buttery lamb meat sauce. LAMB. I love lamb. \n\nDessert:\n- Butterscotch Budino - favorite! sweet, salty, creamy custard. Order this if it's still on the menu.\n\n- Pound cake with strawberries and vanilla cream - a little dry. not the best dessert out there. \n\n- We also had the Gianduja Bar and something else that I don't remember (one too many Smoke and Mirrors at this point), but I remember they were yummy. Better than the pound cake. :) Maybe someone can tell me what else I ordered from looking at my pictures. \n\nThe ambiance is nice. Small and intimate, with a good view of the fire oven and bar.

Dining seating is separated enough to give a private experience, and the ambiance here is something warm, out of Napa, with the patron facing wood fire, wood decor, and heath ceramic plating.\n\nBread, Pasta, Pizza, you can tell are all made with quality ingredients and meticulously rolled out and cared for. It's beautiful to see, and taste the quality of dough, when the kitchen cares for the food they put out. I would call this a Californian ingredient take, on old Italian recipes and everything we ordered was fresh and light, not heavy and overpowering, which is common with pasta.\n\nBurrata with pluot mostarda was a creamy, and buttery burrata with light toast and a pluot jam topped with sunflower seeds which gave the sweet jam a nutty base to tame it and blend into a bite of burrata. \nThe Agnolotti del plin con sugo d'arrosto was small and fluffy pasta filled with shredded veal and pork in a delicious light gravy, which kept me eating 1 after the other. Spaghetti di farro con vongole typically has clam shells and can be watery, but this had no clam shells and plenty of clam meat spread along the perfectly rolled pasta dressed with a white wine, garlic, lemon, and herb sauce, beautifully textured and topped with bread crumb. \n\nThe hostess was very friendly when I showed up without a reservation. She told me they were fully booked but worked hard and was able to find me seating at the chefs counter within an hour. The staff and kitchen is very friendly and professional, and I was able to chat with the grill and oven chef a bit during service. \n\nThere is an Italian list of wines all $12 by the glass which is a reasonable price to sample some quality Italian wine.

Well made Italian food in the quieter end of North Beach which is closer to FiDi area.  This restaurant gets crowded and there can be a bit of a wait. Good thing is there are a bunch of restaurants/bars nearby to hang out while you wait. We ended up walking to Naked Kitchen for a casual drink while we waited for them to call us. Ended up only having to wait 20 minutes! Restaurant is small, great minimal decor, dimly lit, and cozy seating with community tables and small amount of single tables. Sat at the bar overlooking the chefs, which made for a really fun and engaging dinner. Loved being able to watch our food and different entrees made throughout the night.\n\nAs a vegetarian, there weren't a TON of entree options to choose from because this place is very pork focused, which wasn't a huge surprise since it's Italian. We had the house focaccia and fig, almond, and arugula salad as starters. Arugula salad was *very* lightly dressed so the pepper flavor from the arugula over powered the other (small) elements of the salad. Thought the salad was overpriced. The focaccia was actually my favorite item menu..I could have had an entire loaf. My dad had the ancho pepper and corn pizza, which he thought was the best pizza he had in a while. Thin and flakey crust, light corn sauce, and very filling. I had the triangoli which was small but mighty and very fresh. The triangoli filling was slightly sweet and the overall plate was light in flavor versus an overpowering plate of pasta. \n\nOne star knocked off the rating for the just okay service given by our server. Wish our server could have provided more information about the dishes and offered suggestions after I mentioned that it was our first time. Also, since it's Italian, so many of the menu items are in Italian so I wish we should have been willing to spend time explaining parts of the menu. She didn't really check in on us at all, I'd say once and then for the check. Thought the other members of the staff, including one of the chefs, did an amazing job asking us about our meal, clearing plates, and really ensuring that we enjoyed our dinner. I wish our server would have done more of that from the beginning.

My mom ran out to find my lower lip hanging by a thread and blood everywhere. She rushed me to the emergency room where I cried while being stitched up.\n\nNot a great welcome to the world moment.\n\nMy first memory dining at Cotogna however has more than made up for my unfortunate incident. \n\nMy wife and I arrived without reservations on a Friday, but knew that if we arrived early the chances would be good that we could snag a couple of seats at the bar. We arrived at 5:45 and not only found two seats, but they had a few available at the counter where we could watch the cooks knock out pizza pies and serve up some amazing pasta and pork dishes. This would be useful in helping decide what to get. \n\nBut before food comes drink. The cocktail lists some creative libations and plenty of wines by the glass (all for $10). After a quick glance, my wife decided on the \"Crystal Beach\", served in a tall glass on the rocks it's a froofy drink with mint leaves. But this \"froofy\" drink is delicious and I would have no problem ordering it in the future. I went with my standard bourbon sidecar which was the perfect way to kickstart the weekend. \n\nWhile my wife and I sipped on our cocktails, we knew would have to make some decisions. And with our viewing angle of the open kitchen we were able to make what we thought were some great calls. We started out by sharing the Raviolo di ricotta with farm egg & brown butter. This dish is small but rich. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the egg on top helped round out one of the best starter dishes I have had in San Francisco in quite some time. \n\nFor our main we were all over the map. Literally every single dish we saw looked kicked ass delicious. The pizzas! Oh the Pizzas! I wanted you! But we went with the Spit roasted pork with roasted apples and red cabbage. This dish was a out of the park(pork) home run! A think slice of perfectly grilled pork loin, it reminded me of the juiciest prime rib you have ever tasted. A simply prepared dish with just a few ingredients, I would get it again in a heartbeat. \n\nWe finished off dinner by sharing a apple fritelle with bourbon toffee. It paired perfectly with the remaining bottle of '09 NEBBIOLO \"OCHETTI,\" RATTI. Speaking of wine, every bottle on the list is priced at $40. I loved this concept. This takes some of the awkwardness of ordering wine out the way. You know what I'm talking about. You are on a date and the wine list comes and it's loaded with $95-$200 bottles and there is like one $50 bottle  that you know nothing about and point to it on the menu asking your server if this bottle is \"any good\", or are there any like it that might be better. Cotogna does it right, just tell your server what kinds of wine you like and they will suggest the perfect bottle. \n\nThe dining room is rustic and much different than it's sister restaurant (Quince) next door. Cotogna is much more casual and even does a brisk \"take out\" business. This is the perfect place for a casual dinner with a group of friends or for an intimate night out with your significant other.", "author": "Rene C."}

They're generally fully booked at least a week in advance. Even on weekdays! That's how popular they are. \n\nWe were extremely lucky that strolling in at around 7:30pm on a Wednesday, they had a couple of seats just open up at the bar. I ordered the $25 prix fixe three-course and a glass of wine, which ended up being quite reasonably priced. It's nice that all the wines by the glass are $10, so you don't have to think about the prices, and you can just choose what you like! \n\nThe prix fixe for this season was a chilled tomato soup, eggplant tortelloni, and vanilla bean ice cream. We also ordered a few other dishes such as the squash blossom fritto, the gnocchi with nettle, and the swordfish with squid. The squash blossom fritto was not as crispy as I wouldn't liked, but that could have been because we waited a few minutes before we started eating. The best fritto misto I've had though was at Delfina!! All the dishes at Cotogna were quite good, but the only dish that did was the potato gnocchi -- it was fluffy and light, which is very difficult to achieve in gnocchi. The nettle was also baked to a crisp and reminded me of kale chips. I've never had them served in this style before, and I loved it! This could be my favorite way to prepare nettle now. Bravo on this classic (with a twist) dish! \n\nIt seems like this little corner restaurant is no secret anymore, as the restaurant always seems to be fully booked!

You can't fall down in a drunken stupor without landing in the doorway of one. Some are quite good and pricey, more are mediocre complete with half-off coupons, and then there are a handful that are honestly terrific. Bacco is one, Acquerello is another. Add Cotogna to that list. The food is that good. It's too bad it has been discovered by the city's most obnoxious denizens, the middle-aged couples in which henpecked husbands wear pairs of loud Bermuda shorts with their mandated sports coats and inebriated wives just won't shut up about anything. \n\nYes, one such couple was sitting right next to Jamie W. and myself last Friday evening. No matter. Nothing was preventing us from regaling in the culinary delights that chef Michael Tusk provides here in this comfortable, brick-lined eatery next door to his more status-conscious Quince. The $24 three-course Menu al Prezzo Frisso is the jewel in the crown. It started with the Wood Oven-Roasted \"Dirty Girl\" Farm Tomatoes with Zaatar & Burrata which came in a too-hot-to-touch, cast-iron pan on a wooden plank (see photo). It was a tasty twist on a caprese that was a hearty enough appetizer for two. \n\nThe entree was the Tagliatelle with Duck Ragu and Taggiasche Olives, freshly made pasta with succulent strands of duck breast sharpened by the salty brine of the olives (see photo). The dessert course was a fresh and light Panna Cotta with Champagne Grapes & Saba (see photo), the perfect ending free of the cloying sweetness of other Italian desserts. But before we got there, we shared a couple of other signature dishes. First up was the $16 Pappardelle with Lobster Mushrooms, Verjus & Tarragon (see photo), as luscious a pasta dish as I have ever tasted with the protein not at all missing. \n\nThe fungus simply melted into the noodles in a most luxuriant manner. We didn't even have room for the second dish, the $15 Pork Sausage, Nettle & Ricotta Pizze (see photo), a good sized, beautifully crisped pizza that would have made a nice appetizer or entree all by itself. Jamie and I both had a slice each and recognized we were tapped out for the night. We just couldn't help ourselves since everything on the menu was so tempting. Service was attentive but not overly so.

We just got back from touring Italy for two weeks so I set our expectations low... because how could anything be better than authentic Italian food in actual Italy right?  This place had some great dishes and the service was impeccable. The standard wine list was good... every bottle is $50 no matter what you order.  Or you can order wine from the cellar... most inexpensive was $60+.  \n\nWe ordered and shared:\nChicories, blood orange, pecorino & walnut\nBurrata Something (can't remember)\nCacio y Pepe - Delicious\nA seasonal butternut squash stuff pasta - yum\nBucatini all'amatriciana - yum\nDessert: limoncelo gelato and a chocolate mouse\n\nEverything was delicious.

Our server was nice, but I doubt her knowledge of the food/menu (which is mostly in Italian). Luckily, I had reviewed the menu in advance and had a good sense for each offering. Even so, our server didn't ask if we had any questions about the menu or make any suggestions. Basically, if you don't read Italian very well...do your homework! \n\nWe started with a pesto pizza topped with the most delicious little grape tomatoes...very tasty! My husband and I split the cucumber, tomato, and feta salad. The salty feta was so soft and silky. The salad was small for $14, but I assume the ingredients were high quality. My husband had the gnocchi with lamb sauce and said it had a flavor of alcohol that didn't seemed cooked out enough. However, the gnocchi themselves were perfect texture...soft and pillowy. I had the grilled lamb leg. The lamb was nicely cooked but extremely under seasoned. A little finishing salt goes a long way! I also wished it was more of a composed dish for the $$. It was basically meat on top of a smear of chestnut pur\u00e9e and few grilled figs. Good, but I'd choose something else. \n\nWe didn't stay for dessert, but it wasn't because we weren't tempted!", "author": "Kristin W."}

I came in thinking we'd get the raviolo di ricotta with farm egg and brown butter (I'd been stalking the menu - and the reviews - for months). But our server suggested the triangoli because it was a seasonal dish (the raviolo is always on the menu) and she suggested it'd be a better sharing dish for us.\n\nI'm so glad she steered us this way. We loved (LOVED!) the dish - it was far and away the stand out of our night. So enthusiastic were we about it that we had to pass the word on to the four top seated next to us. Whilst we ate dessert their triangoli arrived and they were just as smitten with the dish as we had been. \n\nAs far as our other orders go, I enjoyed the prosciutto and apricots and the egg, lardo, potato and rosemary pizza (but beware, the pizza is substantial so choose wisely if you're also picking pasta). Neither my girlfriend nor I liked the carrots with Greek yogurt. Our server suggested they'd be sweet (which roasted carrots often are) but these certainly weren't. Of everything we ordered, the carrots were the only things we left behind.\n\nCotogna is a great spot for a girls night out (and equally suitable for a date)!", "author": "Miriam W."}

But tonight, after really looking forward to a holiday (albeit Easter) meal and after a two week reservation, and working all day, I can't go back. \n\nThe New Jersey garage band music was awful and loud, and when we politely asked about it, the manager told us the Chef \"really likes to rock out!\" Did Michael and Lindsey sell the restaurant? Does anyone think awful white boy garage band music fits their distinct sense of food and wine in the dining room? I leaned over to the four people next to us, trying to have a conversation, and asked their opinion, as I was wondering, am I just being a crank? -- they confirmed...\"awful.  It's AWFUL!  \" they screamed back and added they could not wait to leave. \n\nOn top of the nightmare ambience, there were other disappointments.  I was looking forward to dinner all day. I stayed hungry. Of course the always wonderful focaccia was...wonderful. And my pea shoot gnocchi, (with the addition of some grated Parmesan, which I don't think the diner should have to specially request) was delicious -- light and airy. But I ordered the entree of quail -- tasted wonderful, but there was only one tiny quail. I checked with the waiter and yes, one quail was the entree serving. I asked two people to order another one -- I would have spent another $30.00 on one quail -- but I guess they assumed I was joking. I took a bite of my dining partners pasta with meat sauce...very nice fettuccine in butter and meat fats. Hmmmm....no protein there either,  I think. \n\nThe sweet waiter brought us a cannoli on the house -- very nice, but all the wrong timing, so we refuse it  -- I still wanted some kind of dinner.... not sugar ... so please, just the check.  Anyway, asked for the check again... and again. My dining partner now outside and I at the front of the restaurant to hopefully speed things up. Finally, the check, and then home to enjoy some leftover filet from a very enjoyable dinner out on Friday evening. Hundreds of dollars and weeks to book  -- a shitty music headache and I  end up with leftovers. Not what I planned for the great evening out. They must have sold the place.", "author": "Richard H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-04-22", "description": "We came here based on a recommendation by someone working at a restaurant we were at the night before. He gave us a list of new places, and hearing it was affiliated with Quince (which we really enjoyed), we decided to stop in for lunch on a Friday. We managed to get an early booking, and we went in to try it.\n\nFirst of all the dining room is really sparsely decorated. Which is fine. It's also completely crammed full of tables. Which brings on several problems. First, when the room is half full, there is so much noise that practically the only way to hear the person you're dining with is by shouting. Second, the tables are so close together in some places, it may as well be communal dining. There's nothing like dining at a restaurant where you have to shout at your dining companions PLUS being so close to the other tables that you can completely hear everything the people at the neighboring tables are talking about. I learned a lot about the next table's opinions on fine dining and how someone tried to make a home made ham twenty times, but he still isn't satisfied with how it turned out. \n\nSecondly, the service is strange. We were trying to figure out something to drink, and the server came up. We needed a bit more time, so she said she'd be back in a couple of minutes. Then my partner decided nothing on the wine list looked great, so we decided to try the homemade chili soda. Unfortunately, it was probably around ten minutes before anyone came back to our table to get our order. \n\nFoodwise, things are really good. We shared the artichoke salad to start. I had the raviolo with ricotta and an egg yolk and my partner ordered the sunchoke pasta. We were both really happy with it. At the beginning of the meal, I was thinking about trying the tiramisu, but given the server never being around and the din of the restaurant, we were just ready to get out and not deal with the horrible surroundings.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because I think more high end restaurants need to open up restaurants for when you don't want a fine dining experience. However, Cotogna went a bit too casual and tried to fit too many people in with terrible service, so I won't be back. The delicious food is just not enough to tempt me back.", "author": "Grant T."}

On my last several trips to San Fran I ended up in the Mission district, where there are a number of great places to choose from (Farina, Beretta, Flour+Water, Trick Dog, etc).  This time I wanted to stay in the North Beach/Financial district area and ended up at Cotogna. \n\nIt's a fairly lively and compact space that feels good as soon as you walk in.  They have two separate \"bar\" areas to sit at.  On the right is the actual bar and on the left is where the wood fired stove and open grill are.  The only stool left when I walked in was on the left.\n\nService was immediate and friendly.  She helped me decide on several food choices I had considered and took my drink order.  My Old Fashioned was excellent!   The charcuterie tray had some of the freshest meat I've ever tasted, with several condiments and some great bread.  I ordered a marguerite type pizza that had a spicy sauce (but not too spicy).  I watched the pizza dude prepare it right in front of me.  He gave every pizza he made his tender loving care, making sure to constantly check on it and pull it out of the wood burning pizza oven at exactly the right time (it only takes several minutes to cook).  It was delicious, with a nice charred crust and the freshest ingredients. \n\nA lady sitting next to me got a pasta type of dish that she said was one of the tastiest she's ever had.

So if you're looking for Italian food in a warm, chic setting that's more affordable, come here.\n\nDo note that reservations are a must. I made mine 2 weeks prior to coming here and there were patrons who were turned away without reservations because every table in the house was booked. For lunch. On a Wednesday!\n\nI can see why this is such a hotspot.

I haven't even gotten to the food yet.\n\nWhere should I start? the warm ricotta cheese pot with wild mushrooms served with crunchy crostinis have that perfect balance of textures. The PORK SHANK AGNOLOTTI in a hearty tomato sauce was outstanding. I could find no fault with the pillowy GNOCCHI in a drool-worthy cream sauce,fresh dungeness crab and sweet peas. What about the delicate steelhead crudo? we didn't order this, but we got transferred to another table, so this came our way compliments from the kitchen! I'd skip the pizza next time, even though the lamb sausage and nettles combo was delicious, the crust itself was too floppy to support the ingredients. \n\nI had an aperitif called Kitten's Whiskers -- mixture of sweet and dry vermouth and OJ. It was sip-worthy, but I don't think it should've cost me $9 for this. \n\nNevertheless, pricing is just right for the quality food you get.

However, upon first glance, Quince is much more upscale and polished compared to Cotogna which is more casual and rustic. \n\nAfter seeing Cotogna on the \"Hot on Yelp\" list for weeks in late January/early February and seeing they have Uni Pizza on the menu, it quickly rose to the top of my Yelp bookmark list. Unfortunately, it took one month to get a reservation for a party of 4 at a reasonable dinner time (there was nothing earlier than 8:45 PM).\n\nLast night, 3.8.11, my friends and I finally made it to Cotogna. We had 6 PM reservations and were promptly seated.\n\nD R I N K (S):\nIf you're a wine drinker, you'll be happy to know all glasses are $10 and all bottles are $40.\n\nI opted for my usual Hendrick's Tonic ($11) since I tend to KO with wine. My HT was perfectly balanced with just enough gin and crisp sparkling tonic without that overpowering alcohol taste. \n\nF O O D:\nThe menu changes regularly without notice and to our dismay, the Uni pizza was NOT on the menu. \n\nDo note that portion sizes are a bit on the smaller size, so starting off with an antipasti or sharing a pizza is highly recommended. \n\n*COMPLIMENTARY BREAD: OMG--SO GOOD! \nThe bread was like a hybrid of a focaccia and a croissant. The crust was crunchy and the center was rich, buttery and ultra fluffy. The sprinkle of sea salt gave a subtle burst of saltiness, just enough to tickle your taste buds. \n\n*PIZZA w/ Nettles, Lamb Sausage & Ricotta ($15 +$3 for an egg): MEH!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=pY0zUYoACINH7pNKRSMy6A\n\nWhat makes a pizza a \"pizza\" is the crust and Cotogna totally falls flat on this. The outer crust was crisp and chewy but the rest of the pie was just plain soggy. Although the lamb sausage and ricotta added a savory salty creaminess, it wasn't evenly distributed throughout the pizza so half the slices was just crust with a hint of tomato sauce. The egg was overcooked so there was very little runny yolk to add that additional layer of creamy decadence. The nettles (greens) had a subtle bitterness to help balance some of the richness of the pizza.\n\n*SPIT ROASTED PORK LOIN w/ Fennel and Hot Peppers ($22): YUMMY (but only for the first 2 first bites)!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=TqMLN2HhXvkK_MqEdfdyWQ\n\nThe pork loin was actually two thin slices of pork crowned with a spare rib. The pork had a surrounding layer of smoky crackling skin (similar to lechon) which gave it a rich crispiness and a juicy mouth feel to it. However, in the areas that lacked the rim of skin (80% of the pork), it was very dry and chewy. The spare rib was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside, but it was very difficult to cut with a butter knife. The pork was well-seasoned though and the fennel and peppers added just the right amount of licorice and heat without overpowering the natural taste of the pork. \n\nFyi, apparently I wasn't the only one that thought the pork was dry. The couple sitting next to us complained to the waiter that the pork was overcooked. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nAWESOME!!!\n\nOur waiter was super friendly and down-to-earth. He was more than happy to answer our questions about the menu and offer suggestions. Our pizza came out within 10 minutes and our entrees soon followed suit. He checked on us several times to make sure everything was ok and made sure our water glasses were always refilled. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nThe exposed brick walls, amber lighting and simple wooden furnishings created a casual and rustic atmosphere. The highlight of Cotogna is the open kitchen where you can see bank of flames from the wood burning oven and rotisserie grill spit which created a warmness to the restaurant.\n\nCotogna is very loud and it's very difficult to maintain a conversation without having to lightly shout across the table so I wouldn't not recommend it for an \"intimate\" date. \n\nP A R K I N G:\nStreet parking is easy to find right before 6 PM on weekdays. However, parking is difficult thereafter and on weekends.

The experience is \"lukewarm\" at best.  I would love to give them 4 or 5 stars because I am a HUGE fan of Quince, the high end sister restaurant.  Here goes...we had an early reservation on Saturday before 6 pm & was seated quickly. The restaurant was not even half full at that time. However, we sat and sat and sat & no menu & no wait staff even acknowledged or approached us.  Finally, the hostess came over to give us the menu, after 10 minutes. And then we sat AGAIN for another 10 minutes and the hostess again came up to explain the menu and she said she could take our order.  Asked her if there was a waitress for our table, she apologized and said she was the assistant manager.  I wanted to order the Porchette which was their signature dish and she said they were behind and that dish was not ready for another hour or more.  Anyhow, we finally ordered our entree and I made another selection since I could not have the porchette and my husband ordered a glass of wine too.\n\nAfter the wine was placed at our table, my husband lifted the glass to drink and the stem just snapped.  It was pretty funny cause it just snapped. One of the waitress came over and said since the break was so clean, there was probably a fracture at the stem.  They replaced it with another glass. \n\nOur food came in a timely manner and we had the Nettle custard and the focaccia bread for appetizer. It was good but not excellent.  My husband had the meat sauce pasta and I had the squid spaghetti.  Again, it was fine but nothing out of the ordinary.  The tables are close and the noise level is terrible at this time as more people came in.  A couple that came in later was seated next to us and when our entrees came, I saw that the couple next to me that came later was served the porchette! - which was the entree that the hostess/assistant manager told me was NOT available for another hour! I asked them if they called in the order before hand  and they said no! they just ordered it when they sat down....\n\nPerhaps it was their off night but I did not have the same experience with their service or their food as some of the other reviewers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-22", "description": "***Michael Tusk's Cotogna is more casual and price friendly than his fine dining establishment Quince, which is next door; Cotogna is popular and the food is good but not spectacular***\n\nCotogna is from chef Michael Tusk, who runs the very good fine dining Italian restaurant Quince next door.  Cotogna is much more casual with a comfortable and lively dining room as well as a more price friendly menu (Cotogna is also open for lunch).\n\nI really like Cotogna's decor.  There is a great use of blonde wood throughout the restaurant.  And though the restaurant is small, they do a good job of spacing out the tables and opening up the space with large windows to make the dining room feel less cramped.  All of the decoration is modern and distinct (I liked the use of the existing structure too--the brick wall and the metal angular beams on the walls, which are like Quince).  There is a bar that looks comfortable and inviting; there is also a counter seating area right over the pizza oven like LA's Pizzeria Mozza.\n\nThe lunch menu at Cotogna is a mix of Italian starters, pastas, sides, and entrees.  There are also a few pizzas.\n\nI started with the charred octopus salad, which consisted of chilled octopus, trevisio, celery, and olives.  The salad immediately reminded me of trevisio salads at Pizzeria Mozza and Pizzeria Ortica (Costa Mesa) because of the bitterness and the heavy use of vinaigrette.  Everything in the salad was fresh and crisp, but it was a little acidic.\n\nThere was a generous amount of octopus, but I would have preferred it warm.  Also, it was not as soft as octopus I have had at other Italian restaurants like Carnevino (Las Vegas) and Valentino (Santa Monica).\n\nI tried a few pastas next.  First was tortelli di zucca with brown butter and crispy sage.  This type of pasta can be found in a lot of Italian restaurants (though a lot of places use butternut squash instead of pumpkin).  The version at Cotogna was an exceptional pasta.  The pasta was nicely thick and the pumpkin puree was creamy and had a prominent pumpkin flavor.\n\nThe garnishes were good and I liked the sweet and very fragrant brown butter sauce.\n\nI also had the chestnut tagliatelle with poricini mushrooms, which was a much less flavorful pasta.  The tagliatelle was also nicely thick and had a good bounce to it, but I was expecting a richer flavor from the use of the mushrooms.  The dish was not bland, but it could have used another element like a sharp shaved cheese or bitter greens.\n\nThe chestnut tagliatelle here (and even the tortelli di zucca) felt very traditional and kind of unexciting.  The pasta creations at SPQR might be a little less true to their roots, but the pasta there feels new and lively.\n\nThey also served a good and soft herb crusted focaccia complimentary that probably goes well with the food here though both pastas I had were a little light on the sauce.\n\nFor dessert, I started with the cinnamon zeppole with bourbon cream.  The cinnamon zeppole were little donuts that were reminiscent of funnel cake in flavor.  The donuts were hot and good--crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  The flavor was lightly sweet, but the cinnamon flavor was not that prominent.  The bourbon cream was a good and very thin dipping sauce.\n\nNext came brioche wrapped poached pear.  Inside the brioche was also nuts and dates.  The brioche dessert was garnished with a light cream sauce.  This was very interesting, but I was not a big fan.  The brioche was slightly crisp and had a lightly sweet flavor that reminded me of brioche from Asian bakeries.\n\nThe pear center was good with a strong structure (not too soft), but I thought the overall flavor and textures were kind of boring and uninteresting, which made finishing this dessert a bit of a challenge since it was such a big dessert.\n\nService by Shayla was great.  She was very personable and attentive as well as polite and very knowledgeable about the menu.  The food came out at a quick pace.\n\nPrices are reasonable.  They use good quality ingredients throughout the menu and a lot of the menu items (with the exception of the entrees) are well below $20.  They also feature a reasonably priced 3-course lunch for $24.\n\nCotogna is reminiscent of Pizzeria Mozza and Pizzeria Ortica.  I prefer Pizzeria Mozza because the flavors are much stronger there.  I would probably give the edge to Cotogna over Pizzeria Ortica because Ortica seems to have a very unchanging menu.  Cotogna does feature good housemade pastas and their pizzas look great.  The atmosphere is great and the service is strong.  Though Cotogna does not serve my favorite Italian food, it is a good option for a nice and satisfying lunch.\n\nYou might be able to find metered parking on the street, but a lot of the spaces are 1-hr parking only; you can find parking meters with longer allowed times near the Ferry Building.", "author": "Anthony N."}

First course was the chick pea and farro soup with black cabbage crostone, followed by the main course of tagliatelle with ragu bolognese, and the creme fraiche panna cotta for dessert.

We booked a couple of weeks in advance- our only options were 530pm or 9pm, so we took the later time and were lucky enough to switch to 730pm the night before- maybe this is a super secret trick which I unlocked?\n\nAnyways, the restaurant is housed in a nice location next-door to Quince, and we arrived early, had a drink at Quince, and the bar staff alerted us when our table was ready next door- I liked the way this little mechanic worked out actually.\n\nThe Cotogna dining room is not very large, the tables are right on top of each other, every table was packed, and it is VERY loud.  We were waited on promptly- and we selected to split two pasta dishes- an egg-filled ravioli, and a gnocchi dish.  Both dishes were excellent, the ravioli was $12 I think and there was just one- maybe 1 bite each.  The gnocchi was more generous of a portion...By the way- the bread is listed as 'by request'- and I pity the fool who doesn't request it.  Their bread is a deliciously seasoned focaccia - loved it and maybe this was my favorite part of the meal?  Anyways- it perfect for sopping up the great sauces from the pasta.\n\nNext round we split a pancetta and brussel sprout pizza.  Sounds weird, but it worked.  The pizza was quite good- thin and crispy and much in the genre of those served at Flour+Water and A16- these two are clearly similar in style to Cotogna and direct competitors with similar menus from my perspective.  The pizza was tasty- a slight notch below those served at these other two restaurants.\n\nFinally, we finished with a special of the day- a very small portion of meat lasagna.  It was excellent, but really we each had two bites.  \n\nAll in all, our dinner tasted great- but when I think about the experience and complexity of getting the reservation coupled with very small portions for several of our dishes- I have to rate this a notch below A16 and Flour+Water- both of which I feel provide a better value and dining experience.  I will come back- and when I do I will try their porchetta which looked great- probably a mistake on my part to not have ordered it.  I will yelp it if / when I can get in again- but I wanted take a 9pm reservation now that I know what this place is about.\n\nOne last comment- the very next day I decided to purchase two of their 'brown bag' lunches which I saw advertised while we were there for dinner the night before.  That particular day there was a fried chicken sandwich served with a rice salad dish and a cookie- excellent tasting lunch and a decent value @ $12.  I will surely try this brown bag lunch option again if in the area...", "author": "Andy S."}

Casual yet classy, Cotogna is a satisfying and stress-free experience.\n\n- Sausage, Calabrian chili, arugula, caciocavallo pizza ($17): This sounds like a normal pizza, but the flavor profiles are a bit deviant from the usual sausage pizza fare. The sausage is tender and cooked to a medium, rather than well-done. The tomato sauce tastes exactly how a mashed up tomato would taste, which cuts through the other heavier flavors. Despite the \"chili,\" the pizza is not spicy at all.\n\n- Chicken, puntarelle, pine nut, squash agrodolce ($27): The plating of this chicken was absolutely gorgeous. This does take longer to cook (as our waitress warned us). I've never had puntarelle before, but the bitter taste and crisp texture was a good contrast to the sweet agrodolce. This comes with a leg and 3-4 slices of chicken, so it is a stab to the wallet, but hey, Cotogna is accurately labeled as $$$.\n\nI often see a healthy number of business lunches going on here, and it looks like a solid choice for a professional meeting.

While the staff was nice and helpful, I found it that the menu being completely in Italian was pretentious. We ordered the raviolo, the gnocchi, a vegetable entree and the foccacia. The raviolo was nice, but I felt it was a touch too rich with the butter and the cheese. The gnocchi was a big disappointment though. It came in what the server called a glaze, but it basically looked like a sauce of milk and cream. It was very unappetizing and we ate very little of that. The vegetable entree was good and the foccacia was very nice. For dessert, we got the hazelnut tart, but we thought it was a little dry by itself. With the little creme anglaise on the bottom, it was fine though. All in all, it was neither gourmet nor comfort food.", "author": "Manjesh N."}

Last time I came for an early dinner, and the menus didn't differ too much in that there is a ton of selection. You can still order appetizers, pizza, and pasta dishes for brunch, and there are a few choices in each section to choose from. Since my friend and I were going to the SF Chocolate Salon after, we only chose two dishes; however, it was very difficult to only choose two since everything sounded delicious! We settled on:\n\n-Carrot Sformato w/Spring Onion & Buttermilk ($12,http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cotogna-san-francisco?select=5o0KXJCQhrU16qyLNmrTUA#FbNGBFHwn4EwC2u15emz3A): AMAZING. I've had sformato before, but not like this! You could taste the sweetness of the carrots in the sformato and I loved the addition of the roasted carrots on top. The sformato was also smooth and creamy, and the flavors worked well together. A must order!\n-Fried Chicken, Buttermilk Biscuits & Honey-Butter ($15, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cotogna-san-francisco?select=5o0KXJCQhrU16qyLNmrTUA#5o0KXJCQhrU16qyLNmrTUA): Yum! This was a huge portion, and I'm glad we were sharing. The honey they drizzle on top of the biscuits is from the beehive on their rooftop, and it was delicious! I wish they gave you a small side of honey so that you could have more with your biscuit and chicken. The fried chicken was cooked perfectly, and it was nice and crispy. Recommended!\n\nMy only complaint is that service was really, really slow, even though we told them we were in a hurry! I only had a half an hour on the meter, and had to go back and put in another half hour of time, and even then barely made it back to the car in time. We came in at noon, and they were only half full. It was a nice day so we requested a table outside and were sat right away, but 5 minutes passed and there was no sign of our server or our waters. I finally had to go inside and ask the hostess about our server, and it still took them a few minutes before they came out to take our order. I mentioned we were in a bit of a hurry, which the person taking our order acknowledged (I believe they were covering for our actual server), but it took at least 15 minutes before our first dish came out. Luckily the second dish followed fairly quickly, and we asked for the check right away, but it took at least 10 minutes for that to come. We needed a box for our leftovers, but of course, no servers were available, so I had to go back inside and ask the hostess. She went to the back to ask about a box, and then came back out and said someone would bring it to my table. Five minutes later, someone (another server?) came out to take our plate so they could put it in a box, and five minutes after that we were finally able to leave.\n\nMoral of the story- don't come eat here if you're in a hurry, or dine inside, or order for take-out! However, the food here doesn't disappoint, and apparently brunch is a great time to go since they're always booked out for dinner. There was plenty of street parking available, but everything is metered. Don't forget to pay the meter on Sundays too, which apparently not a lot of people know about since we saw cars getting ticketed left and right.", "author": "Amy D."}

Cotogna not only ruined dinner, but possibly my whole life.\n\nMy family was in town for one night and we decided to walk from their hotel in search of a good restaurant. It was about 10:30 when we found Cotogna. At first glance, Cotogna looks like a very nice place, good design, nice lighting, and seemingly friendly staff. Then we ordered the food...\n\nI'll try and keep this short and to the point.\n\nEvery single dish was worse than the next. The pumpkin soup was bland. The fried green tomato and burrata appetizer was possibly not even human food. A shame to even include burrata in the title! \n\nThe ravioli tasted like school cafeteria food!

Everyone was pretty friendly...but...i feel like I had to flag down ppl for things. For example, I had to ask someone for water instead of someone offering me water (I know..being nit picky, but I'm on my lunch hour so I would rather not have to flag someone down for something so simple). Next was having our check returned...that took awhile as well. I mean..ok, we're splitting our cards but still....slow. \n\nOn to the food...\n\nIt was...ok..Not something I would completely crave. We ordered this sausage pizza (which was really skimpy on toppings but I guess that's a true Italian place because I know for pizzas, it's light on sauce and topping unlike what we're use to with American style pizza). What I liked about the pizza, is that I saw them tossing the crust which was ...of course made fresh! It was made to perfection and it was chewy. Only thing I didn't like about it was it was slightly burnt but I guess when you use a brick oven, that tends to happen?\n\nOn to my bowl of pasta. It was something Toscani. I wanted something with a tomato sauce so it'd be light and not heavy like a cream sauce. Lets start with the pasta itself...it was again, cooked to perfection. It was al dente but the sauce was VERY sour. My coworker I think didn't really like it but I did. My only gripe is is that at first taste, it kinda reminded me of Chef Boy R D?  Oh, another gripe was that the portion was sooooo dinky! For 18 dollars I would've expected something amazing. I had Italian for lunch I think last week (won't say where) but oh my gosh....it was dinky but it was so amazing that I'm still craving it now! But...this pasta was def. not worth it.\n\nI know you're an Italian restaurant but please, have SOME English on there to let us know what the items are. My coworker and I had to google everything to know what everything was. All in all....I don't think I will be coming back.

Or, we could sit at the bar. What? So we asked if we had arrived 15 min  earlier, would we still have to leave by 7 pm?  She rolled her eyes and gave us an annoyed look, as if we had wronged her in a previous life, and just repeated her initial statement. We should have just turned around and walked out at that point since there were several unoccupied tables and no reason for her to pressure us like that up front. \n\nWe sat at the table, and our server was great. The food was decent but nothing particularly special. Portions are ridiculously tiny considering the price, but our server cautioned us about that. $18 for one ravioli with an egg on top.  What a farce! Wines by the glass totally sucked. Seriously the wine was shit. \n\nThought about ordering more food after we shared a salad and two pasta dishes since we were still hungry but it was already 6:45 and we felt pressured to leave (not by our server as she didn't even know that Ashley had given us the time limit ultimatum), so we did.

Either hostile/unfriendly, or clueless. We are foodies from Las Vegas and spent a good deal of time on yelp and asking around. We decided on Cotogna (we only had one dinner opportunity).  After walking over a mile with a stroller to get here, we asked for a table for 2 adults and a child. Granted, we have a 2-year-old. Granted, we had a stroller.  Yes, I realize we are in a decent restaurant trying to bring a child in. \n\nIt was about 5:15 and not busy at all. Empty tables everywhere. The hostess said she had no table for us inside, but we could dine outside. We figure there must be 40 reservations, fine. So we attempt to sit outside, in the cold, windy San Francisco climate with our daughter. We get water and then the server doesn't come back for over 20 minutes. Finally, we decide that this is ridiculous, to put us out in the cold like that, just because we have a kid. We tell the server we are leaving and she just says, \"okay! Have a good night!\" Enthusiastically. Happy that we are leaving. \n\nSo basically we walked for a half hour to get somewhere that was highly acclaimed, to sit out in the cold for a half hour. The hostess never gave us another option. We would've been fine waiting longer for a table (though the place was empty).

The 'Gnocchi with Tomato Leaf Pesto' on their specials and the 'Devil's Gulch Rabbit Tre Modi' (3 ways) quickly caught our attention so we ordered just that.  As we waited for our dinner, we looked through their wine list and had no idea what we were looking at since we don't know much about Italian wines.  All wines by the glass for $12 makes it easier to try different ones without contemplating price vs what you might get.  Some laughs and a couple of sips later, our gnocchi and rabbit arrived.  That's when everything started to get \"Progressive\" on us.  \n\nFilled with excitement, we leaned in to smell the waft of fresh aroma of the tomato pesto and the savoriness of the tender rabbit.  Our noses started to wiggle as they tingled with joy.  We looked at each other and... found our noses had turned into bunny noses.  We took our forks and went straight for a piece of gnocchi.   With eyes closed to enhance our sense of taste, we savored every moment of that soft fluffy little piece of silky doughy dumpling that went perfectly well with the bright flavors of the tomatoes and pesto.  As we opened our eyes, our seats and table had turned into pillows while the walls of the dining room grew some vines.  At this point we gave each other the \"WTH\" look.  We then went in for a bite of the rabbit with our eyes closed.  What an incredibly moist rabbit with such an amazing combination of flavors from the greens, grapes, and Chanterelle mushrooms!  As we were still enjoying that first bite of rabbit, our server asked us how everything was so far.  Slowly opening our eyes from such a dreamy state of flavors and texture, we told our bunny... I mean server... no bunny... she was a bunny now for some reason... everything was perfectly delicious.  Heads down, we decided to really dig in to feed our anxious bellies.  A few more bites of the gnocchi and now the floors were made of silky soft fluffy pillows while servers were walking around with a pillow under one arm.  The ceilings and walls were now covered with fresh tomato vines.  Half way through the exquisitely prepped rabbit done 3 ways, all the servers turned into rabbits and bunnies in dress shirts and vests while tending to the guests.  We were feeling a slight sense of sorrow that our wonderful meal was coming to an end with our last pieces of that amazing gnocchi.  Our bunny came over with our check.  We paid it.  We got up.  We came to the realization that we were now also bunny rabbits!  With our tastebuds and bellies satisfied and happy, we gave our cute bunny server a bunny nose kiss as we frolicked through the fluffy pillows along those fresh tomato vines and made our way through that door, back into the fields of SF.\n\nWhat a weird night... \n\nBest gnocchi ever.

Holy moly, beet never tasted to sweet and dressing was nice and tart. The salami and cheese was a great combination. Next off the menu was two different types of pastas, grilled carrots and peppers.

The second pasta was a cream pasta with broccoli. This was a cream pasta. I think the cream pasta a bit too heavy. The grilled veggies were next, and they both had a good crunch, made the cream pasta a little easier to eat. \n\nThe sole with ragu was the last course. The fish is extremely light and buttery. It topped off our festive but filling lunch with a bam. The portions that came along our family style lunch were extremely big. We had a lot to bring home to our secretaries.

I recently went back and seems like the food and service have gone downhill.\n\nI would give the service 1 star, less if I had the option.  I had a 5:15pm reservation since that's all I could get.  The place was EMPTY.  The hostess went back and forth not sure where to seat us. Then, she sat us next to one of the few occupied tables....a family with kids.  I really should have asked for another table because it was the typically situation, kids are out of control (bumping into me the entire meal) and the parents are gulping down wine and zoning the kids out.  Next, we waited about 20+ minutes for our waitress to take our drink order.  Did I mention the place was EMPTY, think there was one waitress working until 6pm or something.\n\nWe had salads, pasta, dessert, and wine.  I had a glass of red wine and it tasted like vinegar.  Tasted like the bottle was opened a few days earlier.  I got a different glass of wine, it was drinkable.  I dine out a lot and this was one of rare occasions where I thought the wine sucked.\n\nFood, 3 stars.  Had the salad and pasta, during that time, the waitress never check on us a single time.  Someone dropped off our food and someone else cleared our plates when finished.  No one ever asked if everything was ok or if we needed anything.  The portion size of the pasta is painfully small.  Given the price, I would expect more in terms of flavor and/or volume.  After we finished our entree, my husband and I were still starving.  We would have ordered an additional course, maybe a pizza, but the waitress never checked in on us.  After our entree, she plopped down a dessert menu and left.\n\nThis will be my last time dining here.  Service sucked and the food was just ok.", "author": "Shelly W."}

Truly a bustling spot, rich in blond woods with every seat filled as suits discussed business over the popular prix-fixe, it was just after 12:30 when our full party finally sat and with time constraints duly noted our order was expeditious, though service was anything but as long delays left us picking at bread early on and literally 'wolfing down' the complimentary Wolfe Ranch Quail as the clock neared 3:00pm.  Fawned over by the Maitre d' due to my table-mate but not particularly benefitted by this save for the quail served with an apology for slow service it was largely with an eye on diversity that the rest of our meal progressed and flowing from lighter flavors to those more bold a common theme emerged, the perfect produce and light saucing far outperforming proteins I found to be generally overcooked and underportioned given the price - the tender tripe a lone exception, though still not on par with that at A16 or Delfina.  Focusing on the strengths of the meal it bears mention that the wood fired pizza deserves high praise for its seamless marriage of savory and sweet atop a smoky crust while Tusk's team again showed a deft hand with filled pastas in the silky Triangoli filled with what can best be described as cream corn veloute rife with butter and just a touch of aged cheese.  Certainly not a 'bad' meal by any means but one that could most certainly have been better both in food and service suffice it to say that I won't be rushing back to Cotagna given the high quality of the Bay Area's mid-range Italian scene but I'd also not dissuade others from giving it a chance, particularly those interested in focusing on pasta but not yet willing to go all-in at the dual Michelin starred spot next door.", "author": "Michael U."}

I will explain why below!\n\nMy sister and I have been eying this place for a while, and we finally decided to try it.\n\nAs we walked in, we saw an open-fire oven at the bar, and we decided that we wanted to sit there. The restaurant was pretty empty with at least 60-70% of tables empty on Saturday at 4 pm, yet they only took our order after 15 minutes, which was totally fine, since we weren't in a hurry.\n\nWe ended up ordering:\n\nBroccoli di ciccio sformato with anchovy & Calabrian chili: essentially a broccoli souffl\u00e9, which I loved.\n\nLittle gems with smoked trout & green almonds: one of the very few salads on the menu, which was also great.\n\nCrescenza, asparagus, prosciutto cotto & egg pizza (without the prosciutto).\n\nThe sformato and the salad came out in about 10 minutes and we took our time enjoying our food, chatting, and looking at the pizza station and some of the prep work that was done in front of us (the actual kitchen is inside). So reason #1 as to why it's so hard to get a reservation: their process is not planned out at all. We saw the kitchen staff just standing there a lot of the time, pretty much doing unnecessary labor or waiting for 2 pieces of bruschetta to cook in the open fire oven. Our hands were itching to jump into the process and organize it, since we are both trained in streamlining processes and system organization and development. For example, we watched how they were making the pizza dough:\nSomeone came out of the  kitchen, looked around, took out the scale, went back to the kitchen, brought a big container with flour, left. Came out with a bag of flour, left. Came back with a knife. Opened the bag, left. Came back with a pitcher, added some flour to the container, then took out some flour. Left. Came back with another container with water, repeated the process, then left. Then came back out and took away the flour and the water... Then another kitchen employee took out their safe box. Took out a knife from it, sharpened it, and left. Everything is done extremely slowly. All that, while a huge thing of pork was burning in the oven, seriously, it was black.\n\nAfter we were done with the two dishes, my sister was taking pictures of what we thought was our pizza in preparation. Turns out, it wasn't our pizza. Then we watch another two pizzas getting prepared, which also turned out to be not our pizzas. Finally, about an hour after we were seated, our pizza order was placed (so much for allowing 15 minutes for the pizza preparation)...\n\nAnd there it was, our pizza, just a foot away from use, looking perfect. A person came up to it, look at it, shook their head, then another person came up to it and shook their head, then it was taken inside, where I'm guessing another person shook their head, brought back out, where yet another person came up, shook their head and then the pizza was taken away.\n\nWe asked what was wrong with it. As it turns out, the pizza was cut the wrong way (the egg was broken), and it was thrown away.\nFor every 10 pizzas that they make, 3 (!!!!) are recalled because the pizza isn't circular enough (it's too oval), or the crust is too thin/thick, the bottom isn't brown enough, or the egg isn't centered properly, or there's too many burned edges.\n\nAfter an hour and a half after we were seated, we finally got our pizza! It was delicious (not as good as some other pizzas that I have tried, and a little too salty).\n\nThey also don't have diet coke, but they have regular coke? WHY?\n\nNo one ever stopped to take my sister's cocktail order, so she just gave up. We were also promised a \"little more foccacia\" while we waited, but that didn't come out either. Though our waters were almost always refilled.\n\nThere you go, now you know why it's so hard to get a reservation here. We will be back to try some of their other dishes :)", "author": "Anna P."}

Our meal consisted of:\n\nPrawns Baked on Sea Salt: fennel, pistachio, olive & cherry tomato.\nThe prawns were perfectly cooked. They were served in the shell so we had to get a bit messy. The flavors were pretty mild, but it was tasty. I don't know if ours had any pistachios in it though...I didn't spot or taste any.\n\nPolpo Affogato (supplement $15): octopus, escarole, beans & onions\nThe octopus was served on a bed of beans with a fennel. I can't really comment on the beans because I am not a bean fan. The octopus was wonderful though. The most tender octopus I've ever eaten. Highly recommended!\n\nRigatoni Alla Norma: eggplant cestino, smoked ricotta & hot pepper\nThis dish had typical italian flavors, very tasty but the portion was pretty huge. I kind of wish I didn't stuff myself on this so I could eat more of the fish and dessert courses.\n\nSpiedini Varie: swordfish, tuna, lemon leaves with broccoli & caper\nThe fish was cubed and served on kebab sticks. I really loved the swordfish. Both of the fishes were perfectly cooked.\n\nTiramisu\nThis was delicious although I couldn't eat more than a few bites after our huge meal\n\nWe also ordered the wine pairing. The wine selections were all a bit too acidic for my tastebuds, but I think they were paired well with the courses.\n\nOverall the food tasted very clean, light and fresh. No unique flavors though. As far as the ambiance, the atmosphere and decor is modern, yet comfortable and cozy. The tables along the window are a bit too squished together though.

It took several minutes to even make it into the restaurant because it was so busy. We made reservations about three weeks earlier and we're looking forward to an excellent dinner. When we finally made it to check in, we were told that we would likely be waiting 30 to 45 more minutes before a table would be ready. I explained that we traveled halfway across the country and made our reservation weeks earlier but that did not seem to matter to the hostess. There was no room to wait inside so we stood outside the restaurant and passed the time with other diners who were also waiting past their reservation times for this obviously overbooked restaurant. After about 15 minutes, the hostess came out and suggested that we might look for somewhere else to eat since they had overbooked their reservations that night. We declined, explaining that we made reservations weeks in advance to avoid this very issue. And so we continued to wait. Around 9:30, we were finally seated. The service was certainly lacking, probably due to the fact that there was not even standing room in the restaurant. The food was fair to good, but certainly not as great as we were expecting. I ordered the tagliatelle which was not bad, but again, nothing special. My wife ordered the quail special that was recommended by our server. It was good but we have had better. Overall, we were very underwhelmed with this restaurant and appalled at the poor reservation policy. Beware: just because you have a reservation here does not mean it will be honored.

The pizza was so greasy that it was, in fact, utterly inedible.  I couldn't eat very much of it and stupidly got talked into taking the rest of it home.  I deposited it in a garbage can halfway down the block afterwards.  The pork in the pasta was so burnt that it made the entire dish inedible (it wasn't \"overcooked\" -- it was BURNT . . . ).  Service was perfunctory (you could tell he was \"phoning it in\" -- this is just not what Cotogna has always been about -- what happened?).  I'm going to take my fun elsewhere.  Cotogna has clearly lost its way.", "author": "Thomas M."}

But if you haven't had Cotogna's Tuscan ribs, then you have not had great ribs. Why are they so great? Apparently, they're soaked in milk first, which breaks up the proteins and makes them tender. Not regular tender, but cut-them-apart-with-the-side-of-your-fork tender. Wow. One portion feeds two. \n\nOh, so, I suppose there was more than ribs here. I heard about this place from a friend. As a longtime Quince fan, I was keen to try it. It's connected to Quince -- you can get some bottles from Quince's wine list and you should take a stroll towards the bathroom to look through the massive kitchen corridor that joins the two restaurants. \n\nWe also had the sformata - creamy, salty, delicious - and a chilled lettuce soup that perfectly fit the hottest day in SF this year.\n\nGluten-free notes: Most stuff on the menu was gluten-free, and they were happy to leave croutons off dishes that had them.", "author": "Ellie P."}

We had a salad dish that was delicious and it's flavors blended together very well, but all the other dishes was above average. Like the pasta we had tasted just like a lighter creamy version of an Alfredo, and the duck was an interesting sweet and savory taste but nothing to be wow'ed at. \n\nMoments later, it seems that our small concerns about the dishes brought the attention of the manager. He was very generous and kind about offering us a complimentary cheese dish to make up for our lack of interest. The cheese dish was amazing tasty and I think was my favorite dish out of the other 4 dishes but a little tied to the salad. \n\nAfterwards, we got our dessert and the flavors was very interesting. For me, I think the dessert was good but was overall a bit too powerful since it's ginger and sweet cake and it was like the other dishes, above average. \n\n\nAt the end of our meal, we got our tab and saw that we were charged for sparkling water $6. I was surprised. I asked if there were any signs or warnings that I missed and the waitress said that there was a warning in the drinking menu. If I had recall, the waitress came up to us when we were sat down and asked if we wanted sparking or still before we even opened up our drinking menu. And so I had assumed that the sparkling water is for free. And also, we couldn't read the menu because it was %80-%90 in a different language. It was probably true that it's my fault for not reading carefully, but I guess I'm a bit upset that they assume that we won't miss this type of information if we open the drinking menu and that they assume that we have paid for sparkling water at restaurants before and so therefore we should know.\n\nOverall, we paid $185.77 including tax and tips. Both my boyfriend and I thought it was not worth it especially when we have gone to many other restaurants that costed less for a better taste. Maybe it's my ignorance but I would have appreciate the waitress showing that she feels a bit bad about my misinformation of the sparkling water, and not walk off like, \"it's not our fault cause you can't read.\"  our waitress was good but I just felt like even the host I talked through the phone was a bit rude. I had a complicated schedule and had to rearrange and she sounded like she was annoyed and was in a hurry. \n\nOverall, I think how the manager handled things was really great. Service was okay. The food was a 7 or a 8  out of 10. The interior design is 7 1/2 out of 10. Unfortunately, I don't think we're coming back but if you give me enough time, I'll probably try it again, just because my boyfriend is in search for the best gnocchi, but it won't be anytime soon.", "author": "Elaine N."}

It was a very good spread of food and it's much more casual than Quince which coincidentally I was at just a week before. The service is warm and attentive. The space has huge, beautiful windows looking into the bar area which showcases the wood burning oven and semi open kitchen. If you go to the restroom you can see the rest of the operations with cords of wood being layered throughout. Great for a casual meal with friends or a date with that lucky other person.

Eric said he would ask the owner. He came back a moment later and said the owner said not to seat anymore people even though they were open. The owner came over and was extremely rude. She said it would be too difficult for them to process our payment. Honestly, her attitude was unprofessional and unbecoming of a restaurant owner. Eric, the manager, told me while the owner was away that he personally understood why we were confused about the refusal to serve us. I told the owner that as a lawyer I would never tell a client I can't file their brief because the online system is down. Point is you do what it takes to make it work for a first time customer arriving during your open hours while you are serving other customers.

The decor seemed to fit the rustic italian vibe I believe they are going for, as well as the wood fire oven you see when you walk in the doors.  \n\nThe prices might make this place seem a bit upscale but don't let that scare you away. I split a lamb sausage pizza and an order of corn triangoli.  Hands down best meal I've had in a long time.  The pizza dough was in authentic Italian style.  The crust had just enough chew but still had a but of toastyness from the wood oven.  All the toppings were top notch too especially the cheese.  This may sound cheesy but it just tasted fresh to me.  \n\nThe star was the corn triangolis though.  I never would've thought that little raviolis would be so good but they were filled with this creamy corn mixture that might as well have been called umami bites.

My wife and I went to Cotogna after 9 months of rescheduling our OpenTable reservation.  For that, you have to be ready to make the reservation at least a month out.  We also have family that has gone to the restaurant many times for corporate events and raved about this famous spot.  \n\nIn a nutshell: my wife and I arrived at 7:00 for a 7:00 reservation.  We left our table at 9:40, two hours and 40 minutes later, after having 1 salad, 1 pizza, and split two pastas.  Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious, for the most part.  However, we waited 30 minutes to see the server for the first time and get water.  Then, we waited 20-25 minutes in between each of our 3 courses.  We got a bottle of wine and had that just about finished before the pastas even came to the table.\n\nThe manager did come over and apologize and offered to make it up to us, but at that point, we had been there for over two hours and just kind of wanted to go home.  So, he gave us a business card and said to give it to the hostess and he'd take care of it if we go back.\n\nOne other item: the efficiency of the front.  While we were there for 2:40, there was a 4-top that had a 2-top, a 2-top with a 3-top seated, and two 2-tops that sat empty for at least an hour.

This is my go-to spot: a cozy, casual ambiance and true, traditional, rustic Italian food.\n\nIf you don't mind something a little rich, the sformato is out of this world, especially if they serve it with their parmesan sauce (the flavor tends to change seasonally - the carrot and the artichoke are the best). The pastas are excellent, handmade in house, and are a must if you've never been. The meats and fish are also very good, well cooked and served with delicious accompaniments. Desserts are simple, but great - they have ones like a butterscotch chocolate budino or a delicious summer berry tart with vanilla whipped cream, and every once in a while they have a panna cotta that can only be described as fantastic. (Oh and they have wood-oven fired pizza too!)\n\nIt is ALWAYS busy in here, no matter what day, so book in advance. There are also walk-in dinner/lunch spots at their bar, but they don't take reservations for that or even wait list names over the phone, so you actually have to go into the restaurant to get a seat at the bar or put your name on the wait list.\n\nI have always found the service to be great, and the staff will happily explain anything on the menu. Once I was even comped a pasta dish when I went on my birthday. On occasion, if they are really busy, it can take a few minutes to be seated because the restaurant is fairly small.\n\nThe one thing I wish they would bring back (if anyone from Cotogna happens to read this!) is the baked ricotta with pickled mushrooms.

Only the specials change on a daily basis and per the time of service.  I love that their menu is dictated by the freshness and availability of their ingredients, and had been looking forward to trying a couple of dishes but it was those two items that weren't on the menu on the day of my visit!  No worries though, as I was able to try some other dishes and ended up loving them.\n\nWe were there for brunch and were joking around that it was too early for wine, but it was never too early to have Bloody Mary's!  It was good, but spicy!  It's not exactly your traditional Bloody Mary, but an modern interpretation.  The focaccia was amazing -  nice and crispy on the edges, seasoned perfectly with salt, pepper and red peppers for a hint of spice, and rich and moist on the inside.  You'll definitely want seconds, as we did.  After one bite there is no stopping until the check is paid.  \n\nTo start we shared the warm ricotta with wild mushrooms and grilled bread.  I've never had warm ricotta before (outside of a lasagne) and wasn't quite sure what to expect, but this dish was so good!  The combination of creamy, melted cheese with roasted mushrooms was heavenly on buttered, grilled bread.  \n\nFor my main course I chose the pappardelle with braised oxtail.  The pasta is handmade and went well with the braised oxtail.  The portion of pasta was perfect as a little goes a long way given the richness of the oxtail.  You better believe I sopped up the sauce with the focaccia!  I would highly recommend trying the pasta while dining here, as it's what they and Quince are known for.\n\nService was friendly, down to earth, unobtrusive and efficient.

We tried our luck and got seats in front of the pit grill once again - perfect.\n\nWatching the cooks at work is part of the joy or frustration this time around.  With the demand, the pizza making was getting more and more sloppy.  When the worst pizza was made - I made a comment to hubby, \"that better not be for us\" and luck would have it - it was ours.  It was bad - I didn't bother touching it.  They gave it another try - knowing it was a repeat and we are sitting right there watching - it was still sloppy work.  Keep the pizza - I don't need it.  The good from it - the attentiveness and graciousness of management and staff and they did not charge us for the pizza.

Yummy, fresh, perfectly al dente pasta FTW!\n\nAMBIANCE: Very cute, rustic-chic interior with exposed brick walls, hanging copper pots/pans, and a prime view of the \"open kitchen\" & wood-burning oven.  Lots of natural light during lunch hours, which I absolutely love.  For whatever reason, it was fairly empty on a Saturday at noon.  Is it always like this at lunchtime?  If it is... take advantage and EAT HERE.\n\nSERVICE: Friendly-ish, but seemed more aloof and less genuine than other places.  However, my water glass was ALWAYS filled promptly by the busboy, so thanks for that (even though they left a bottle of water on our table... I could've done it myself).\n\nFOOD: \n- Aglotti dal plin ($17): reminded me of Chinese dumplings.  I wasn't a huge fan of the butter \"sauce,\" but flavor was pretty good and the pasta itself tasted very fresh.\n- Garganelli with pork sausage & nepitella ($17): the better of the two pasta dishes IMHO.  Slightly spicy, oh so flavorful meaty sauce over al dente pasta; lip-smackingly good.\n- San Marzano tomato, pancetta, ricotta with fresh farm egg pizza ($17): YUM! Loved the crust and the generous cubes of pancetta.  The egg was nice and runny-- perfect for dipping into!\n\nAs others have mentioned, be sure to ask for the foccacia!  It is fresh and delicious-- soft pillowy innards surrounded by a nice and crip crust.  Lightly seasoned with salt and red pepper flakes... YUM!\n\nOVERALL: Extremely enjoyable, delicious lunch.  My only regret?  Not having enough room for dessert!  Next time, I'll be back to try other pastas and some mains (and of course dessert!).", "author": "Susanna W."}

I've been dying to try the fix price menu.  I came here on a monday at around 8:30 pm and was seated at the communal table.  I don't really understand how communal tables were ever popular.  Okay this is wasn't as bad as the 18 person table I was once seated at (this one was only for 8 people).  But nevertheless, 2 people at a 8 person table is still a bit odd.\n\nOn to the food.  The 3 course of meal of the night ($24) included fava bean salad, duck ragu pasta, and lemon torta.  The fava bean salad was pretty good.  I like the added edamame and shaved Parmesan, however the seasoning could have been mixed better as some parts felt bland and others over salted.  The ragu had a great flavor but the portion was on the smaller size.  Maybe even smaller than the salad.  The lemon torta was far too sweet, but the top had a thin layer of rice krispy and the toasted meringue reminded me of smores.\n\nThe main disappointment was actually the drinks.  We ordered 3 drinks: mojito, voodoo child, and the brazillionaire.  All of them tasted a bit rough.  Perhaps it was the south american rum?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-05-25", "description": "To tell the truth I was a little intimidated to come to Cotogna. Getting a reservation was on par with finally getting an invitation to this popular girl's birthday party when I was fourteen. Her dad was the mayor of a small Northern California town and the location on the invite said 'mayor's house'. Having secured a spot, anxieties pop up. What to wear, how to act, what to order, who to bring. Nothing changes, except her parties did not have farm egg raviolos. More on that to come.\n\nWhen you walk down Pacific you get the feeling that Michael Tusk is claiming this block as his own, doing a little Monopoly action with Boardwalk and Park Place, aka Quince and Cotogna. The night my friend and I went to Cotogna, he had just won the James Beard hours before. If he buys up the railroads and Marvin Gardens too, I will not be surprised. The man has talent.\n\nHaving my coveted reservation, we were promptly seated at a cozy and small table. There is a lot to take in once you arrive. The dining room is beautiful, but the kitchen is where the true beauty lies. The wood fire pizza oven is out strutting her stuff, and you can catch glimpses of the kitchen from the dining room. A walk to the restroom provides the perfect cover for being a pepping tom as you walk between the kitchens, able to see the action and the accouterments (hello, copper cookware) in all their glory.\n\nThe menu made me bemoan the fact that I'm human and have a threshold on how much food I can consume. There is a lot being offered; I hazard that upwards of three or four trips would be required to even get an complete sense of what Cotogna is offering. I can recommend everything that I ate, wholeheartedly.\n\n-Pizza with guanciale, ramps, pecorino romano and an egg. First thing we had, and the most involved pizza on the menu. Perfect charred bites made the pizza even better than the sum of the wonderful ingredients. \n\n-Green chickpea sformato with grana padano-rich savory custard perfect for sharing. Very delicate flavor.\n\n-Gnocchi with dungeness crab, lemon and peas-who doesn't like gnocchi? Not perfect but not a problem. The consistency of gnocchi is so hard to get right.\n\n-Farm egg raviolo with brown butter-this is going to become a hall of famer legendary dish. One farm egg, cooked in 180 degree water for a couple of minutes, mess on your plate, happiness in your body. That's all you need to know.\n\nAll wines by the glass are $10, bottles are $40, not sure what the corkage fee is. I can't recall which glasses I had, but between my oenophile dining companion and the server, I was recommended two appropriate and delicious wines. \n\nOh and the gelati? Much better than the mayor's daughter's ice cream cake. Huckleberry and green apple were a light finish to the decadent meal. \n\nThe only thing I'm anxious about now is when I can get another reservation to chisel away at the menu's other offerings. I better get to reserving now; Cotogna is one popular party!", "author": "Joanna M."}

A little early to eat, but I guess, we are considered lucky to get reservations within two days. Reservations for this restaurant is too hot...\n\nThis place is hot on the market probably because \n1.) Place is super cute.\n2.) Offers standard $40 wine bottles or $10 glasses\n3.) Offers three course $24 meal \n4.) Everything is fresh and affordable\n\nPlace is small and adorable. Clean and open fire oven with meat roasting over it. Whole place is so quaint. \n\nWINE: All wines are from Italy (all bottles are $40 each). I think that's clever pricing for the menu. We tried Mongrana Maremma Toscana 2008. It was a Sangiovese/Merlot Mix. Recommend by waitress, and thought it would be safe to go with a mix. Not memorable and needed to air out more. I would suggest trying something else.\n\nFOOD:\nBread is free, but you must request it. It is tasty, but sometimes, they seem a little heavy on the olive oil the bread sits on. But of course, it is fresh.\n\nVignarola (poached egg, artichokes, english peas, spring onions, and pecorino) (3 of 5) - Fresh spring vegetable flavors. Nice, but not a repeat dish for me.\n\nTagliatelle with Duck Ragu (4 of 5) - Fresh noodle and duck combo is sensational. The duck taste is so tasty mixed into the noodle. \n\nTagliolini with Dungeness Crab & Lemon (3 of 5) - Compared to the Duck, this is actually less tasty. The crab flavor didn't climb up to the same level as the duck. But I like how they added the lemon zest to the noodle. \n\nPizza with clam, smoked tomato & aioli (2 of 5)- I was not a fan. A lot of people ordered pizza, but this pizza was not a wow factor. Clam was a little sandy.\n\nFour Story Hill Farms Calves Liver \"Alla Veneziana\" (3 of 5) - Huge piece like 14 oz sirloin steak for $18. Bang for the buck. Wonderful charcoal grill marks and flavoring. I had to share this one. I don't think one person can eat all that liver.\n\nSpit roasted pork lion with wild fennel (4 of 5) - Delicious. Juicy. So much meat. Generous portion. The roasting technique was mastered so well. The skin became like a pork rind chip still stuck on the meat.  \n\nGnocchi with asparagus & morel mushroom cream (5 of 5) - Favorite. I expected them to taste like potatoe pillows. Instead, they tasted like cotton pillows and full of mushroom flavors. I always get full from gnocchi, but this dish, I can eat all of it and more. Light, full flavored, and delicious. I loved it.\n\nDESSERT:\nRicciarelli, Biscotti, & Carbone (2 of 5) - I felt like it was just a dish of cookies. I was not a fan. \n\nCreme fraiche panna cotta with strawberries (3 of 5) - Creamy.

The appetizer was decent - some kind of burrata and eggplant chip thing. Presentation was a bit juvenile and it was slightly under seasoned, but it really wasn't too bad. It was all downhill from there. The pasta course was served luke warm and incredibly bland. The duck course was also served luke warm (and bland). We debated sending it back, because it would certainly be better hot, but at this point we realized the chef clearly didn't believe in seasoning. We did, and the waitress was gracious and accommodating. The maitre d even apologized and bought us a cheese course. \n\nDesert was a Thai gelato that was delicious. But obviously not why we came.  \n\n$250 later we had consumed a crappy meal and were pretty unhappy. We will probably come back, but definitely not on a prix fixe night.", "author": "Mike F."}

In fact, I honestly don't even know if I have given other yelp reviews. But, I need to call this place out for what it is: overpriced food that, if given to me in a plain white room with no decorations and normal lighting, I'd answer \"Olive Garden\" to the question, \"where do you think this food is from?\" The food is NOT good. The \"bread\" is basically a hot dog bun with olive oil on it. The chopped salad is an abomination. Average romaine, cold cut grade salami and cheese, onion and olives. Chopped. That's it. The gnocchi is in a vat of oil, butter and cheese, where the only complex thing about the dish is mustering the ability to take another bite.

We were also told we could go next door to their sister restaurant, Quince for a drink, and they would get us when the table was ready. \n\nWe sat at the lovely bar next door for quite awhile....By the time we were notified our table was ready, it was about 45 minutes after the reservation. I don't mind waiting a few minutes for a reservation, BUT, not when I'm told they're running almost on time, and not when the wait is that long. What's the point of making a reservation? \n\nNot the ideal beginning to a meal. Although,  the server was very nice, and very knowledgeable about all the dishes. \n\nWe decided to split a margherita pizza, and we each got one small-ish pasta dish. I had the tagliolini with dungeness crab, and my guy had the farm egg raviolo. Both were delicious. \nWe then waited a VERY long time for our pizza, Although, i must admit, the crust might be the best I've ever had. The sauce could have used a bit more kick, and i prefer fresh mozzarella to the smoked they use here. The smokiness kind of overwhelmed all the other flavors. \n\nWe also shared the milk chocolate & almond milk budino, which was divine. \n\nAll in all, the meal was pretty good. Satisfying, without being overly heavy. \n\nAre there places that are a better value for similar food? Yes. Should the wait time have been better? Yes. \nThat being said, the chef here recently received a James Beard award. So, obviously he can charge more for his food than his competitors. \n\nI might go back in the future,after the buzz has died down a bit, and getting a table is easier.", "author": "Amanda G."}

That experience continues to influence the way I've ordered wine in every place since.  Glasses on, and finger underlining the specific line item on the list, I sound a little uh, slow, when I look my waitron directly in the eye and say \"I'll have the $45 bottle of....\" .  Let there never again be a \"mistake\" like that other time.  \n\nThankfully, at Cotogna, I can go back to my old, sloppy self when ordering.  Why?  Because every single bottle on their great list of Italian wines is simply priced at $40.  And every glass is simply priced at $10.  I LOVE this policy. \n\nI also love an awful lot about Cotogna.  It has an open cookfire going in the kitchen, high ceilings, a big, communal table, and a comfortable space.  The hostess and our waitress were friendly and unpretentious and seemed like real people.  (The waitress was even honest enough, when we asked her opinion about a certain dish, to say \"I don't care for it, but a lot of other people seem to like it\").  Wow!  Honest!  And positive; she helpfully pointed us at dishes she thought we'd prefer and picked for us our two bottles of wine (excellent job)!  And, since that wine was all $40 per, there was no potential for being steered towards something that would pad the bill.  \n\nFour of us got to try a lot of the menu and there's a lot that you'll want to try, so going with four friends who are willing to share is a good way to start.  I got the three course \"Menu al Prezzo Fisso\" which was a bargain at $24.  It included a starter of grilled asparagus with beets and smoked mozzarella, an entree of 2 giant grilled sardines which sat on some sort of beans and grilled greens.  The sardines were meaty, salty, and delicious.  This specal also included an apple crostata for dessert.  Someone at your table should get this special (whatever it is; at $24 for three courses, it's a great deal).  \n\nI also loved:  \n* Warm ricotta w/ artichokes and salt roasted onions ($10) - I would come back just for this.  It was perfect.\n* Bomboloni w/ ricotta, kumquat, and limoncello sauce ($7) - Little sugared donut holes with a dipping sauce.  Yummmmm...\n\nWhat else did we try?:\n\n* Grilled prawns with puntarella ($10)\n* Steelhead tartare with horseradish and lemon ($10)\n* Roasted carrots w/ honey & anise ($6)\n* Mixed lettuces with yogurt and avocado ($6)\n* Spaghetti w/ Mussels & spicy Rockfish ($16)\n* Chicken w/ Braised greens and Shallots ($20)\n* Skirt steak w/ creamed spinach and semlina fried onions ($22)\n* Affogato (warm espresso poured over vanilla gelato ($7)\n\nOur seating was at 8:30 and our waitress, refreshingly, did nothing (not even bring us our bill) to move us along at the end.  She seemed fine to let us sit and linger, adding to what had already been a pretty perfect night.  \n\nWith all of the good food, good wine, and good friends, I may have been viewing Cotogna through rose-colored glasses, but everywhere I looked, I saw stars, nothing but stars.  5 of 'em to be exact.

This is innovative and fresh Italian food / pasta with a rotating menu, so you don't have to worry about being bored on repeat visits.\n\nI've been here twice and have not been disappointed either time. They have a great prix fixe of an appetizer, pasta dish and dessert for $26, which is a great deal.\n\nTheir focaccia is great, so make sure you ask for it with your meal - they won't just bring it to your table. I am surprised it's not brought out with olive oil, but it's tasty on its own and great for soaking up extra pasta sauce.\n\nFor 4 people, we ordered one prix fixe, one appetizer, one pizza, two pastas, and one dessert and it was sufficient food. I'd recommend doing everything family style so that you get a chance to try everything.\n\nThe menu changes fairly frequently, so it's hard to recommend specific dishes. During my visit (Aug 2013), the best dish we had was the corn triangoli ($17), which is a ravioli with corn. It has fresh ricotta inside, lots of melted butter and corn. This was definitely everyone's favorite pasta dish.  I've had the pappardelle with lamb rag\u00f9 ($17), which is good, but not mind-blowing. The pasta noodles are fresh, but it just has shredded lamb and parmesan cheese - I wish there were other complementing flavors. I know everyone raves about the raviolo di ricotta with farm egg & brown butter, but to me, it was a tad bit salty and very difficult to share since it's one large ravioli. \n\nThe pizzas are a good size, the sauce and toppings are always fresh. I do prefer Una Pizza Neapolitana, Del Popolo, and Zero Zero over this pizza, but it's filling, and they rotate toppings frequently. I just find the crust to be a tad bit soggier than my other favorites.\n\nWe had a scallop appetizer with sea urchin which was delicious - breaded scallop patties with greens, sauce, and little bits of sea urchin on top. We had a vanilla semifreddo and plum tartine for dessert which were both great.\n\nThe drinks are phenomenal - my favorite being the Blackberry Fix which had gin, ginger beer, blackberries, and other delicious things. It just tasted like blackberry juice and ginger beer. It may be one of the best drinks I've had in SF. It didn't even taste like alcohol - dangerous!\n\nAll in all, you can't really go wrong here.

Kinda safe choice, thought nothing can go wrong there. The other meal was with Lamb. With a lot of thinking and considering ahead, the question was, as silly as it may sound \"will it taste too much like Lamb\". You know the kind of taste that has that grassy ending ;) Because then we would have said no. But we gave this good Lamb a fair chance. Unfortunately the Lamb turned out to be a real on...with this gras like taste. \nBut it was not his fault, it was just to good to be blamed at!\n\nAnd that is where the overall experience kicks in. Amazing was the white wine Ribolla Gialla, Ronchi di Cialla, Friuli 2011. The fruity intense taste was a perfect match to the meals we had. Our waiter recommended this one and gave us another choice to try before buying a bottle for the table. And that was just what we were aiming for. So we ended up having two bottles for the table, and this made everyone happy. \n\nThe service was excellent, patient and competent. \n\nThe food was prepared with style times two.

I could have made a better dish myself at home and I would have added a few more spices for sure.\n\nI ordered the Agnolotti dal plin which is supposed to be stuffed with veal and other things.

Pizza was a good size.\n\ni REALLY wanted to like this place and if it isn't for the wait I might even come back here for the pizza. I wasn't sure if it was just me that had these negative opinions about their pasta dishes but my date agreed with my opinions.

You can't go wrong with any of the pasta dishes, all the ones I tried were amazing.  The spit roasted meat on the menu is another good option, they have stacks and stacks of wood lined up in the hallway that they use to roast meat.  \n\nThe wine list consists of mostly Italian wines that go for $10 a glass or $40 a bottle.

Here is why:\n\nThis first point may be a bit unfair, but needs to be stated, dining at Quince was a wonderful experience, so I had high expectations. This made the following issues pretty intolerable.\n\nSecondly, the wait staff was horrible. We arrived and were sat quickly, but were not given water, menus, or met by someone from the wait staff until we were there for about 10 - 15 minutes. When our waitress finally arrived she gave me a glass of water with a chip on the rim--the shard was in my water! When I told her about it, she laughed and took it away, never bringing me another water. I have received glasses with chips and cracks at other restaurants, but have never had it dealt with so flippantly. Minor issue.\n\nThirdly, we were sat at the bar and saw one of the cooks pull a chicken from the rotisserie, cut it open to find it was very, very rare, put it back, then cut a done bird on the same surface and serve it. I am guessing from the other high reviews that people don't get food poisoning from the restaurant, but I can't bring myself to go back after seeing this.\n\nFinally, nothing we had was that impressive.

So we stayed for lamb with roasted kale and creamy polenta and an earthy gnocchi with land and pork sausage in a ragu that all felt like a warm blanket on a crisp night. Why wait for something special when you had it under your nose  the whole time?!", "author": "Chris M."}

But tonight's experience was totally unacceptable. 30-40 minutes after being seated, our first course had not arrived. There was no amuse bouche (in case anyone is wondering.) The second course was a pasta dish that was just okay, and then we waited for the last course, a simple Petrale Sole. First we were told the kitchen produced an unacceptable dish and were preparing another (apologies for the delay.)\n15-20 minutes later, someone whizzed by with a plate to allow us a glimpse of the fish while promising that he'd fillet it and be back in 5 minutes. 15 minutes later my husband and I commented that there was no way that fish was going to be warm when it made its way back to us. Indeed we were served a very cold fish. We sent it back and by then we had been at the restaurant for close to 2 hours and asked for the check. Everyone was apologetic and KINDLY informed us that they didn't charge us for the fish we didn't eat!! The restaurant had several tables with large groups. Apparently that had overwhelmed the kitchen. But why take on so many groups? If group dining is what Cotogna wants, then it will lose those of us who enjoyed good Italian cuisine in a casual and relaxed environment.", "author": "Jenan M."}

The ambiance is fairly romantic, reminiscent of neighborhood cafes in Italy. \n\nAfter selecting a beautiful cabernet, we were not rushed to place our orders. Instead we enjoyed our wine and conversation, periodically asking the waitress for descriptions of the menu items. \n\nWe began with the octopus with haricot vert and marcona almond. If we had not selected this dish ourselves, we would have thought it was scallop salad - the octopus were extremely tender! \n\nFrom the brick pizza oven, we selected the pea shoots, prosciutto, and egg pizza. Salty prosciutto, pea shoots and creamy egg yolk sitting atop a perfect thin crust pizza. Classic.\n\nThe Alaskan halibut with meyer lemon and pistachio was grilled perfectly. Buttery soft flakes of the fish broke off as we shared the dish. Combined with the micro greens, pistachio, and lemon, it was a tantalizing play on the tongue - slightly savory fish, tart lemon, and buttery pistachio.\n\nFor pasta, we selected the homemade chitarrini with sea urchin and fennel. The chitarrini was perfectly al dente and had absorbed the creamy sea urchin and fennel. This dish was slightly on the fishy side due to the nature of sea urchin, but the homemade chitarrini made the dish.\n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate budino with wildflower honeycomb since the lemon torta was exhausted. The chocolate budino was light as whipped cream yet had an intense chocolate flavor like ganache. My date suggested we lick the bowl as the diners next to us were doing when we were first seated. \n\nThe last but most special highlight of our meal was the Italian couple in their 70's seated next to us. They were visiting from Italy and this was their second visit to Cotogna because \"the hamburgers of America is just too heavy, and we really enjoyed Cotogna during our last visit so we had to come back.\" It was so precious to chat about food, wine, Italy, and love with such a loving couple. If Italians return to the US to dine at Cotogna, you know you have found a special place.", "author": "Grace G."}

We walked in at about 7pm and were greeted by 2 lovely and attentive hostesses. This is a big plus considering the day, time and location of this restaurant. We were able to be immediately seated at the bar and were greeted by John and Grant. Both bar tenders were friendly, engaging, knowledgeable and creative. John went out of his way to make me a special drink which I know most bar tenders aren't willing to do. But John amazed me with not only his willingness, but his offering to do so.\nI love the copper counters and they are very well kept. The modern, rustice atmosphere makes a welcoming presence. We had the burrata and the avocado appetizers. We also had the red pepper bread, mussels and clams and a pasta dish.

My fiance and I had our anniversary dinner here last week and overall it was a good experience. Nice ambiance, nice waitstaff. Our waiter brought out three different wines for me to try before I chose one, which was super nice. We had the burrata to start which was delicious. I thought pairing it with broccoli was different, but still good. Fiance had the agnolotti dal plin (good, but I thought the chicken-y filling wasn't as good as maybe a pork or beef) and I had an 's' shaped pasta with a braised short rib sauce. They had a bit of horseradish in there. I hate to say it, but my pasta might have been slightly overcooked. Slightly!  \n\nI liked the food, but to be honest, I wasn't as blown away as I thought I would be.

I have loved Cotogna for lunch - I had even put it in my top 3 places to dine in SF, but was never enough of a planner to secure a coveted dinner reservation. Well I am sorry that I did. It felt like a wasted evening of time and money. The food and cocktails continue to be good, but the place was so noisy that you could not have a conversation and the tables are so close together that all you hear are your neighbors talking loudly at one another. It got so comical that my husband and I just started cracking-up and making face and hand-signals at one another. To top it off the restaurant kept the music going at high volume which was just ridiculous on top of all the conversation noise. I mentioned this to the hostess and she said something about turning down the music, but she never did. Even talking to the wait staff was a chore with things having to be repeated numerous times back and forth.\n\nI had been looking forward to a romantic dinner and was not able to have a conversation or to feel like there was any privacy. We thought it couldn't get any worse and then a table of four sat down next to us after the previous couple left and the two women were literally screaming at each other and their dates - really obnoxiously. All the table around kept looking over at them, but no one from the management did anything about it. I will never go back here for dinner again and we are a young couple who like lively places. Who cares how good the food is or pretty the restaurant is, if you can't have a conversation and enjoy the company you are with?!", "author": "Choosy L."}

Our greeting could have been warmer, but the hostess was polite. I'm kind of abrupt myself, so I didn't think much of it. \n\nThe restaurant itself is lovely; beautifully lit, and elegant without any hoity-toity pretention. We ordered the After Midnight and the Derby Cocktail, both were good, not too sweet, and arrived within ten minutes. We then ordered a bottle of wine, the burrata/radicchio/beets, the farro and mushroom salad, the foccanini, the raviolo di ricotta, the strozzapreti cacio e pepe, and the porcini tagliatelle. The burrata and the farro salad were the first to arrive. The burrata was good, not fantastic, but the farro salad was great. After fifteen minutes, we were starting to wonder about the foccacini we had ordered, so we politely reminded our server that we had ordered bread. A few minutes later, it arrived with our raviolo. Both were delicious - perhaps the highlight of the meal. \n\nThis is where it gets weird. Thirty minutes pass, and our the tagliatelle and strozzapreti are nowhere to be found. Neither is our server. Mind you, it's 11 pm, and the restaurant isn't full. I understand many restaurants try to appropriately pace the meal, but this seemed excessive, especially after our first few dishes had appeared in relatively rapid succession. After a few minutes of trying to get our server's attention to no avail, my boyfriend caught the attention of another staff member. Shortly afterwards, the manager came to our table, and asked, somewhat defensively, \"Is everything okay?\" We smiled and assured her we were just waiting on our food. Our final dishes arrived, without explanation, ten minutes later. The strozzapreti was above average, and the tagliatelle was quite good.\n\nLook, both of us have worked in the service industry, and both of us know what it's like to get demanding, unreasonable customers. But service matters! Any sort of explanation - expediting is going slow tonight/I have a midterm tomorrow/my ex-boyfriend has that shirt - would have been welcome!\n\nAll in all, I would give Cotogna another chance.

I wrote it all down the night it occurred because I was going to send a letter to the restaurant general manager, but having not sent the letter, I'm instead copying and pasting the content in this review.\n\nPrimarily, this review is about one staff member's ill manners, and possible poor training on how to handle customers with serious food allergies.  My companion has a peanut allergy\n\nWhen we ordered food, my companion told the waiter that she had a life threatening peanut allergy, and she asked if that would be a problem.  The waiter dismissively said, \"yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.\"  Later, the food was delivered by a different person from our waiter, and this person did not say a word about whether the food was peanut-safe.  So, my partner waited to eat until she could get the waiter's attention and ask again about whether the meal was peanut-safe.  The waiter seemed irritated that she beckoned him for this, and stated \"yes, like I said, you're fine.\" [Emphasis on \"like I said.\"] His demeanor was rude and he had a scowl on his face...as if we'd insulted him by asking for assurance.  His attitude was so obviously inappropriate, that I got up from our table and stopped our waiter as he was traveling between other tables in order to ask him if he had a problem with my partner's question, and whether there was a problem with us ensuring the food was peanut-safe.  The situation devolved from there, my partner walked out crying, and we left without eating our meal.  Disaster.\n\nOn our way out the door, the manager said that in the future I should know that there restaurant was \"completely peanut free.\"  Assuming that this is true (Cotogna is peanut-safe), then why would the waiter have kept this a secret?  When we first told the waiter about her allergy, he should have said, \"don't worry, we have a no peanut policy and are completely peanut safe.\"  However, it seems like the management has the correct idea (eliminating peanuts to avoid allergy issues), but the staff isn't trained in customer-relations.  Instead of making my partner feel safe, the waiter made her feel like a nuisance who \"should\" be safe, i.e., she \"probably\" wouldn't eat peanuts and die.\n\nThis appears to be a training issue, unrelated to the quality of the food or management policies.  Hopefully, Cotogna has informed the staff that people with serious allergies shouldn't be made to feel like their annoying the staff when they double-check the ingredients.", "author": "Baron A."}

Our waitress was well versed in their wines and gave excellent recommendations based on our personal tastes.  After incorrectly assuming that certain appetizers were meant for all rather than some leaving the rest of us to wait hungrily for our entrees, she quickly had the kitchen whip up some exquisite samples to tide over us hungry vegetarians and had our dinner orders follow shortly thereafter.

It's located right in the Financial District and is super easy to get to, and parking around there shouldn't be too hard, I'd imagine. My group of friends and I had a brunch reservation for 6 that we made about a week in advance and we were promptly seated when we arrived there on Saturday.\n\nService is excellent and they're super helpful with telling us what kind of stuff to get. Oh, as a side note, this place has freshly squeezed orange juice incase you're interested in that - this is rare and was a great hangover beverage before we got the meal started. We also ordered 2 bottles of their rose wine, another excellent choice. They'll also serve you yummy complimentary bread, don't overdose on this because it's addicting!\n\nWe got a ton of stuff on the menu, and another thing to note is that you can totally be vegetarian if you need to. We started out with two appetizers: the summer squash and the buratta. Yum yum and yum. The crostini that comes with the burrata is amazing, and the summer squash is really fresh as well.\n\nFor pastas, we got the corn triangoli, gnocchi, and the lamb pappardelle (triangoli and gnocchi were for the veggies in the group), and all three were amazing. The corn triangoli was my personal favorite - so soft and flavorful, but most people liked the gnocchi best. I tried some of the lamb pasta, and the meat was great quality.\n\nWe also got both the pizzas on the menu and they were able to put the sausage on the side for us (non-veg people just added it to their pizzas), and wowza - both are a treat!! I personally liked the squash blossom one better. They're both very good quality and not to be missed. It's perfect because both the pizzas have 6 slices each, so everyone got to try one of each.\n\nTo end our meal, we got the chocolate dessert and the dirty girl farm strawberry dishes, and I liked the strawberry one better even though I'm more of a chocolate person! It's sooo yummy - totally recommend the strawberry one if anything!\n\nI don't have anything negative to say about Cotogna.

Couples, families, coworkers, and friends, dressed in nothing less than business casual, scattered the smooth, wooden dining tables inside while the smell of something delicious entertained our senses.  \n\nGreeted with a warm smile from Lindsay Tusk herself, we were humbled by the exceptional service and attention.  Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, their drinks, food, and company so no tables were available.  In the meantime, we sipped on refreshing cocktails beside the bar where I developed a new love for Asti Spumante.  Once we were seated (~20min), we knew exactly what we wanted to order:\n\n- Annabelle's chicories with pomegranate and burrata: It was a little too salty for a salad but I really liked where the flavors were going.  Crisp salad with crunchy, sweet pomegranates and salty, silky cheese.    \n- Carrots roasted with rooftop honey & anise: I wasn't a big fan of the sweetness...\n- Buttered fingerling potatoes: Soft and so delicious.  The herb butter was light but flavorful.  Wish we asked for bread to dip it in.\n- Lamb Pappardelle: The pappardelle was green!  The lamb was meaty and didn't taste game-y or like lamb, which I really liked.  \n- Tagliatelle Bolognese: Definitely all of our favorites.  The noodles were cooked perfectly to al dente, nice and chewy!  The meat sauce was rich in flavor.  \n- Cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche panna cotta with pinenut cookies: Smooth, creamy, and tasty.  I like panna cotta to be a little firmer but this was pretty darn good and a nice treat.\n\nOur waiter was well-informed and never missed a beat.  The food came out in no time on hot plates.  My total came out to alot more than I was planning but the experience overall was well worth it.  (With 2 drinks and all of the above split 3 ways, my total plus tax and tip came out to $48)  Portions were decent and I was stuffed by the end of the meal, however, others thought portions were small..\n\nWorthwhile.", "author": "Kat C."}

The clam pizza was awesome and I would LOVE to have the recipe for the cauliflower appetizer salad.  Our family also ordered gnocchi, fish special, quail and  the pork chop.  All very tasty.  It felt very farm to table.  Appreciated that a lot.\n\nThe three stars explanation:  \n\n - The timing was off in a major way.  And the management and wait staff continued to apologize throughout the evening.  We sat down at 8:30 and didn't end up ordering dessert because that point didn't come up until after 10:30.  We were exhausted from our journey earlier that day so we decided to throw in the towel at that point.  I'm sure it would have been delicious.  They comped one entree as a peace offering even though we didn't peep in complaint.  That was nice.\n\n - The tables are too close together.   The arguing couple three inches to our left underscored this drawback.  \n\n - Accoustics.  Wooden tables, wooden chairs, hard floors, brick walls.  It LOOKS gorgeous but it all added up to an uncomfortable din.  As mentioned we were a little tired so we didn't mind eating in amiable silence (because we couldn't hear each other without raising our voices and repeating things) but if visiting with your dining partner is desirable you may find it difficult.  \n\nIt seemed like a really fun place to go for a gang of young friends.", "author": "Urban Girl S."}

I figured I'd be yet another Yelper to repeat that in case you've been living under a rock and haven't read that already in numerous foodie news sources like Urban Daddy or Eater SF!!  As an added bonus, if the owners decide to open a Polish restaurant, they'd need to call it Pigwa!  Name games aside, this place has an amazing $24 weekly changing 3-course prix fixe.  The food is Quince quality and the atmosphere is nice enough to rival the rustic and inviting Kokkari.  Probably the best value-per-dollar in the neighborhood!\n\nHalibut Tartare: This has to be one of the largest portions of fish tartare I've ever had!  The halibut itself was delicate, super fresh and not fishy in any sort of bad way.  The spices were a little bland though, perhaps intentionally so not to outshine the seafood.  I really like the three freshly baked crackers it came with because they had that semi-soft inside you never get from store bought crackers.\n\nPappardelle of Lamb Cooked in Wood Oven:  So simple, yet so delicious!  Slow fire roasted lamb bits (shank I think) that practically fall apart on your fork.  Everything lamb should be, so tender and so savory.  The pappardelle was green and tender adding a nice chewy contrast to the melt away lamb.  Only a small amount of cheese was grated on top, perhaps out of respect not stealing the show from the meat.\n\nCauliflower Gratin: Ordered this side because my dining partner had a cauliflower prejudice and we wanted a true test of the kitchen's skills.  Well, when you cover it with cheese and crisp the top, even the skanky cauliflower can taste good.  The thing layer between between the iron skillet and gratin top was key, more might have been too much.\n\nB\u00f2net with Caramel & Amaretti Crumble:  Like a flan, but three times more delicate.  Rich caramel taste without the eggy undertone that plagues Mexican flan.  The crumble of cookie bits added a nice crunch to otherwise mushy dessert.", "author": "Adam B."}

Difficult to get a reservation so we ended up here at 10:15 on a Saturday night.  \n\nI was hoping to order the gnocchi with dungeness crab that so many reviewers mentioned, but it was not on the menu.  Instead, we went with the server's suggestion and ordered the gnocchi with cauliflower pur\u00e9e - the flavors were light and this was a distinctive, refined dish. (She was right, these are not entree size).  We also wanted to order the tagliatelle with ragu but they were out of that dish.  Next we ordered the pizza with spicy padrone peppers and sausage and this was excellent.  More doughy than zero zero; not overly cheesy; had a great spicy kick to it.  \n\nMy boyfriend also had the yellowtail with beans and he liked it, though he didn't think the beans went well with the taste.  The corn, tomato and pole bean succotash was really good, but it came so late we had finished everything else.  It was also rather salty, which was ironic because we had just noticed that it was nice that the other dishes weren't over salted (which is so common amongst fine dining chefs these days).  Overall a good meal, a solid 4 stars, and we would come back, but it didn't quite live up to the hype this particular night.", "author": "Vivian W."}

Did I personally select poorly from the menu, so maybe I'm rating a place lower than it deserves?\n\nI worry that might be the case of Cotogna - so many other five-star raves - but I just can't find my experience other there other than \"okay.\"  Now, let's be fair, the ambiance is 5-star, all the way; the exposed wood-fire they use for some of the cooking is an amazing and beautiful touch to the look of the restaurant, the background buzz is solid but not too loud, lighting just right, waitstaff properly attractive.  \n\nBut when it comes down to it, given its pedigree and reputation, this place should have astonishing food, and...it just has good food.  But really, with all your choices in SF, is \"good\" really going to cut it?  Neither myself nor my companion enjoyed our meal the way we were hoping to.  The dishes were all prepared with the professionalism and polish you'd expect, but nothing really jumped out.  Nothing made me stop for a moment, close my eyes, and just experience the dish with wonder, as things have at (just to pick a random SF example) A.Q.  For the pasta, we actually had to ask for salt - which is incredibly embarrassing in a restaurant like this.\n\nIt's hard to get a reservation here, and the place is jammed to the gills.  Given the choices you have in the Bay Area for incredible dining, and how this one stacked up - I'm going to guess that's more because of momentary popularity than because it's actually that much better than other local places.

I ordered Peroni beer which is always on the menu at Italian restaurants, but not at Cotogna. The desserts were unappetizing - my husband ordered the lime tart and I took a small bite.

We take the quick stroll down and are greeted as we walk in \"Mr. & Mrs. J\" right this way. Impressive.\nNow I'm feeling a bit underdressed in my polkadot top and skinny pants for this higher end establishment, my REI hubster laughs my silliness off \"no big deal\". Hey they have the nicest hand lotion in the bathroom for after you wash your hands...ooh makes you feel oh so special!\n\nOkay our table is now ready and Quince will walk my drinkie poo back to Cotogna for me. \nWe get a nice window table and start off with some Asparagus that was cooked perfect and just a little crisp, and I'm a little tipsy from my big girl drink (and starved from no lunch-my bad) so we polished that off along with some warm foccaccia. \nWe shared a pasta dish but I can't at the moment remember what it was (damn old age, will ask husband when he comes home and update).\nOur entrees were Salmon for me and my husband ordered a pork chop. Now I know he ordered a pork chop because they brought him a large sharp knife to cut the meat off the bone yes? So when our dinners arrived they served him Quail, which wouldn't it be silly to use a large carving knife? Of course we mentioned that wasn't correct and they immediately swept both dinners away and apologized. We had to wait maybe 15 minutes or so for them to make the pork and redo my salmon....booo and that second it was in front of me it looked so good! \nBut they made multiple trips to our table to apologize, and offer us another appetizer though I was already starting to feel full and wanted to save room for dinner and maybe a bite of dessert.\nWhen we did get our dinners they were really fantastic, I have to say my Salmon was cooked perfect and very moist. And my husband really enjoyed his Fred Flintstone size pork chop! Though that Quail did look mighty fine too. Oh we had also ordered a side of carrots and purple potatoes that were really buttery and delicious, but it was almost too much food with the app and pasta.\n\nWe shared the Dirty Girl Farm strawberry semi-freddo and practically licked the plate clean...did I say I was full? And because they felt bad about my husband dinner mess up AND..that they also took mine away too, they didn't charge us for either entree's....\nI KNOW!\nThe service was fantastic and the place has a nice cozy casual vibe, I would love to come back here again.

The rhythm of the meal is patient, even languid, as befitting a traditional Italian dinner. Seating is generally very close because once you're at a table, you're there as long as you'd like. Also, Cotogna holds tables for walk-in customers, making for an overall \"booked\" appearance on Open Table. I was surprised to see two groups of about 8 people here. Booking a table larger than 4 in a restaurant of this size would never occur to me. \n\nThe restaurant was lively but not too loud, beyond the people on either side who eavesdropped occasionally, including the guys who commented on my girlfriend's butt. No, I'm not kidding. So I went ahead and laughed with her about it while they were still sitting next to us.\n\nOn to the food, which was described by a foodie friend of Italian heritage as most reminiscent of her family's cooking. The burrata and spinach sfurmato were absolutely delicious. The chestnut pasta was interesting. We're glad we ordered it, and enjoyed it, but not enough to order it again. Cotogna has more dishes on the menu and we believe we'd go crazy over something else next time. The squash, nettle, and mozzarella pizza was great. The squab was as good as we've had - served with feet intact, though, so we didn't use our fingers despite being seasoned fried chicken eaters.\n\nPro Move: Book early if you want a decent reservation time. And don't be late, or you might well lose the table and have to wait for something else to open up. This apparently happened to the Italian friend I mentioned above.", "author": "Mike H."}

Great space for a date, special night or business meal. \n\nMy husband and I called ahead at 4pm on a Monday night - hoping for a reservation. No luck - BUT the hostess kindly suggested that early arrivals usually find seats at the bar. The restaurant has valet if you need to park quickly to grab that early seat. \n\nThe service: We sat at the bar, and I ordered a Campari spritz - which was the best I've ever tasted. Light, effervescent with a fragrant dose of orange rind. Perfect. My boyfriend ordered an excellent glass of Lambrusco for around $10. Jay, the bartender, seemed genuinely interested in our questions about the wine and cocktails list and menu (he even gave us tastes of two Amaros we weren't familiar with) and was simply a great server. \n\nPoint: I'm about to rave about the food. But here's the deal - I would have raved about the restaurant merely based on the quality of the food (it was that good). But it was the SERVICE we received that put our experience over the top. The good food/good service combo made this one of my all-time favorite dining experiences. And I'm married to a man who runs a very popular Italian wine bar AND takes me out to a lot of wonderful restaurants.. We didn't catch the name of the other bartender that night - but he was super friendly and attentive as well. Props to both Jay and his colleague for being completely awesome.  \n\nThe food: We asked for recommendations and started with the wood fired squid with fregola - beautifully cooked and light and bright with a hint of citrus and red pepper. Amazing. \n\nNext was fresh ricotta and roasted fig w/toast - a sort of do-it-yourself bruschetta that was warm, creamy, sweet and earthy. I could have ordered it for dessert. Heaven.\n\nNext we shared a pizza special - calabrese salumi with artichokes, tomatoes and pana gradano. The crust was incredible - thin and blistered and slightly charred - and it held its shape from middle to edge. I can still taste it.... \n\nWe wrapped things up with the pork loin with ember-roasted potatoes. It was a large enough portion to share - and easily enough for one hungry person. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Brilliant. \n\nOne side dish: Peppers from the wood oven. They tasted like smoked sugar and we fought over the final bite. \n\nAll these dishes - plus one $45 bottle of excellent Tenuta Rosato and two espressos - cost us $157.00. For such good quality and service, it was reasonable. \n\nWe found Cotogna comfortable, friendly, quality-oriented and delicious. We will absolutely return. And if we see Jay at the bar, we'll sit there again. Complementi!", "author": "Gigi G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-06-23", "description": "Oh Cotogna, where did we go so wrong? I thought you and I were going to be a great match. What with your sweet location on Pacific Avenue--your wood burning fire that was so warm and inviting on a foggy summer night. I had Googled you before so of course I was aware of what was on the menu. And you looked GOOD. So you can imagine my sadness when instead of a night of bliss, you turned things into the most awkward night ever.  \n\nWhere do I even begin? I had made a reservation for 8:00 p.m. and showed up on time. But you just weren't ready. You had other people your were still entertaining and so you sent me over to your wingman, Quince. Ouch. \n\nI mean, I know Quince. Don't get me wrong, it's fantastic. I just didn't want to go to Quince right then. I came to see you. But I went to Quince like you told me and had some obligatory drinks and waited. And waited. And waited some more until I had to bother a server to just please find out what was happening. After about an hour Quince guy escorted me back to you. It was awkward. Have you ever been followed down the street with your half drank glass of wine on a platter being carried by a pained Quince server? It was just weird, like I was being kicked out of a bar, but in the nicest way possible, and with onlookers. But I digress. Back to you, Cotogna. \n\nWhen you finally welcomed me in, you tried to make me comfortable at a table that happened to be right next to the door. A door that somehow wouldn't stop opening and letting in blasts of Arctic air and freezing me over despite the fact that you had to be beyond full capacity and had an actual open fire in the room. Impressive for all the wrong reasons. \n\nYou eventually understood my frustration about being put in a corner after having long waited my turn for a table. And after yet another \"short wait\" guided me to a new table which, although certainly warmer, was placed just next to/under the bar area. I was but mere millimeters away from/under people already eating at the bar (lucky them!) and only one giant shopping bag nearly toppled my bottle of sparkling water. You even brought over what you said you would be \"complimentary appetizers\" (which, by the way, eventually ended up on my bill anyway).\n\nWanting still somehow to impress you, I rescued that bottle from certain demise and showed some enthusiasm about your menu. You talked up the deliciousness of all the pastas. I believed you. However, I really missed a cue when a server recommended the utterly simple \"cacio e pepe\" because of \"how satisfying\" it was. She, being onto your ways, was just trying to say \"order this simple and outrageously overpriced pasta and you will not starve.\" But I didn't listen and ordered the tortellini with squash blossoms and waited some more. \n\nWhen dinner finally arrived over two hours past my original reservation time, you can imagine my surprise when I saw eight flattish, smallish, wan-looking tortellini arranged half-heartedly on a plate topped with a few drips of sauce. Out of sheer embarrassment, I had to absurdly slow down my eating process to avoid devouring everything in less than a minute. Eventually, dessert (required only because of my lingering starvation) was also comically tiny. Have you ever tried to share a thimble of pudding with a friend? I don't recommend it.   \n\nWas this all a joke Cotogna? Do you have a mini-food fetish? I could get onboard with that, I just wish you would have been more upfront with me. And there in lies the real problem, I think. You aren't upfront, Cotogna. You lie. When you say \"reservation\" you mean \"waiting start time.\" When you say \"complimentary\" you mean \"thank me now and pay me later\". When you say \"pasta dish\" what you should say is \"pasta tasting.\" When you say \"dessert\" you should also say \"just kidding.\"", "author": "Diane L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-04", "description": "Recently we went to the relatively new Cotogna for dinner, an offshoot of the popular Quince restaurant.  Cotogna has already received rave reviews from many locals already.  With relatively reasonable price points and amazing food it's easy to see why.\n\nWe started off with an antipasti dish of Warm ricotta with Artichokes and Salt Roasted Onions, served with crostini.  The warm ricotta was served from a cute little Staub cocotte with the artichokes and spring onions laid on top of the ricotta.  Mini crostini were served along side.  Spreading this decadent ricotta atop the crostini and topping it with the sweet, fresh artichoke providing a pleasing bite to introduce us to our meal.\n\nFor our next course we ordered a pasta dish from the Primi section, Gnocchi with Dungeness Crab and English Peas.  The gnocchi just melted in our mouth, and the Dungeness crab provided a light sweetness to the dish.  The peas also added a sweet crunch and nice color to the dish.\n\nFor our main coarse with ordered a dish from the grill Lamb Chops \"scottaditto\" with black olives and tiny potatoes.  Scottaditto means finger blistering and refers to the cooking of the lambs on a hot grill so they are too hot to hold with your hands.  The black olives complemented the rich, rosemary-seasoned lamb. To go with the lamb with ordered a side of Little Gem Lettuces with Yogurt and Dill.  The salad offered a refreshing lightness and crunch after the ricotta, gnocchi, and lamb dishes.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the Bomboloni with Ricotta, Kumquat and Limoncello Sauce and the Milk Chocolate and Almond Milk Budino.  The bomboloni, which are like tiny doughnuts, were filled with sweet ricotta, had extra ricotta for dipping, tangy candied kumquat's were sprinkled over the dish, and a sweet-tart limoncello sauce was drizzled over everything.  The bomboloni were warm, coated in sugar, and melted in the mouth.  The budino was a creamy, smooth, chocolaty pudding served in a cute, little glass.  We were expecting more of a cake, either flourless or molten lava type, both of which I've seen labeled as budino at other restaurants.  This was actually a nice, refreshing change and surprise.\n\nI can't wait to return to try a pizza and some more of Cotogna's delicious dishes.", "author": "Chad G."}

I came here with my roommate on a Saturday at 2pm.\n\nService was a little sub-par. I say that because I feel like I shouldn't have to ask to have my water glass refilled multiple times. \n\nWe started with the bambolini (donut holes) in limoncello sauce. The sauce was very good and I could taste the lemon when I tried it plain. However, once you dipped the donut hole into the sauce, I couldn't taste the lemon at all. The donut holes were a little dense and cake-y and I thought they could have been lighter and fluffier. \n\nMy roommate got the pasta dish with crab and we were both very disappointed. We had high hopes because Quince is known for their pastas. The pasta was lacking flavor, not enough crab, and also the portion was TINY for how much they charged.\n\nI ordered the pizza with lamb and broccoli and that was delicious. The pizza was similar to Pizzeria Delfina. \n\nThe real highlight of the meal was the creme fraiche panna cotta. It was light, smooth and just refreshing.

This place has been nearly impossible to book as they only take reservations a month in advance. Fortunately my birthday occurred on a Monday so we had a fighting chance. \n\nAs this is a very small restaurant with lots of demand, the management has decided to fit as many tables into the small space as possible. Depending on where you are seated, you may end up conversing with the table next to you and even getting a little ordering advice (we received it and gave it). If you are planning on discussing the results of your colonoscopy, you may want to chose another place but if you don't mind the fact that someone can hear every word you say, read on. \n\nTo start your dining experience, be sure and ask for bread. They won't volunteer it otherwise. It's delicious so you don't want to miss it. \n\nFor starters we shared a Asian pear, prosciutto & smoked almond salad plus the Ricotta della casa. Both excellent. For our entres, I enjoyed the lamb spezzatino while my wife went the pasta route and had the Chestnut tagliatelle. Much of the menu was Italian so don't be afraid to ask the waiter for an interpretation.  Or better yet, do as most of our neighbors did and politely ask the table next to them what they recommend. \n\nIf I had a bigger stomach, I'd have tried the pizza as it looked delicious.

Tri-tip with pickled onions and a lemon horseradish creme fraiche. It was so good, I almost got angry. The bread is a little substantial for a sandwich, but it's delicious bread. I just end up not eating all of it. The roasted pork, fried chicken and whatever else they have during the week are generally all also muy delicioso.\n\nThe sides: Could use a little help. The ingredients are always smart combinations, the mixing of mint and lemon in with vegetables, or a roasted potato with loads of tarragon and mustard seeds. However, after eating that whopper of a roll, the last thing I want is pasta salad or more potatoes. I'd be better if those sides were more often beans and vegetables, or just a straight up vegetable salad.\n\nThe cookies: always awesome.

I must say I love the ambiance and the service was great as well. The food was good, not great but good. \n\nWe started with the prosciutto, cheese and mortadella plate which was eh. Not bad but nothing spectacular. We then had the gnocci with crab & mussels which was awesome. It was served family style but I could've eaten the whole plate by myself. Little clouds of heaven mixed with fresh crab & mussels in a light butter sauce. Mmm mmm mmm. We then had the mixed meat (chicken & lamb) skewers that came on rosemary twigs and served with cioppolini onions and little potatoes. The lamb was tender and flavorful, the chicken was good but some pieces were overcooked. The potatoes were ok and the onions were grilled nicely with still a little crunch to it. The last course was the tiramisu. Being that I'm not a fan of the dessert, I can't give a fair assessment. I can say there was a strong expresso taste though. \n\nWhat knocks this place is the uneven dishes and the fact that I could see one of the chefs rubbing her nose and eyes then touching the food. She had a red nose and watery eyes. I really hope it was due to being in front of the hot pizza oven and rotisserie but something tells me she had the ickies. Really glad she didn't prepare our food.

Next up was \"raviolo,\" a single, perfectly-shaped pillow of ricotta with a soft egg inside.  The yolk ran into and mixed harmoniously with the luxurious brown butter surrounding the plate.

I am not sure what the big commotion is about this place, but I was soon to find out. \ni have to say, I HATE 'NICE' restaurant that over crowds the tables, I understand that you are 'busy,' but shoving too many tables so close together is super annoying. Basically I went on 2 first dates one my right, and another on my left. It seriously was super uncomfortable. I think I had better conversation with my neighbors than I did with my friend. SMH!\nWe started off with a couple of drinks, because I had to be buzzed for this experience. I had the halibut appetizer and she started with a pasta. It seriously was fish, HELLA olive oil, couple of orange with dashes of chili pepper. SERIOUSLY. I didn't even want to finish it, but my neighbors went into their 'how they like it in bed' talk conversation so I had to pretend I was busy 'eating.'\nI had the spaghetti for my main, and my friend had lamb chops, and for dessert she has the panna cotta that was watery and I had a apple something. There was absolutely nothing about the food that gave me the 'WOW' experience. I have to say, I won't be coming back there is nothing about to food, service, atmosphere that rocked my socks. Smashing elbows, smelling my neighbor breathe and hearing their convo is enough for me to X that for life.", "author": "Zane T."}

It did not disappoint.\n\nFirst of all, the service was great.  Our server helped us make the right selections for sharing.  We would have made the wrong choice otherwise. And, my water glass was never even close to empty.\n\nWe had the exceptional burrata.  My dining mates were a little skeptical, having never heard the word before, and they loved it! Our server even offered to bring over extra bread to help us finish off the burrata. It was definitely worth the hype.\n\nWe shared the sausage, pecorino, and wild ramp pizza, which was also great.  We also had two pastas, which were even better.\n\nThe tortelloni with fava beans & morel mushrooms was my favorite.  The filling was creamy and rich, but not too rich.  I don't even like mushrooms normally, but they added a lot to the dish.\n\nI had to wrestle the agnolotti away from the couple I was dining with.  We all enjoyed it, although I preferred the tortelloni. \n\nAn extra plus for me, considering I have to drive in from Marin is the valet parking.  I think I probably could have found parking after much circling around, but the valet was great.  And, they bring the car up for you right as you leave, taking you ticket when you pay.

I feel so drowsy I can not help but wonder if the Imperialist Army from china snuck into Cotogna and drizzled sleeping potions over all our food.\n\nThis is THE place to go for rustic, high end comfort Italian food. I thought the wooden tables, exposed brick and exposed wooden beams at the ceiling gave this place a warm ,cozy, look, that feels more like \"your rich best friends dining area\" rather than just being pretty but removed like many other places. \n\nBTW, for all you single dudes with no wife nor kids nor mistress may have to check out all the cute females servers and hostess here. Not only will your mouth water at the food, but your eyes will be feasting on some serious eye candy. \n\nThe pizza with farm egg, lardo and red onion was worth fighting for. Lardo is pork fat cut to resemble a side of meat or sausage. It is just fat..good and incredibly porky flavor that elevates the Pizza into the stratosphere. \n\nCoffee was good and stiff like ron jeremy on a porn set but word of caution..the  peeps here WILL charge for refills \n\nAlso had the polenta with panchetta (nicely cured ham) and that had me calling for an airstike on China if I can get more.  \n\nlastly, tried also the pasta with dungeness crab.

It used to be $74 for the 3 course menu; it's now $130. Cotogna seems to have followed suit in rip-off menus. I had the $55 sunday night prix fixe menu. We had a cold soup, 2-3 pieces of deep fried rabbitt and a small dessert. I was starving afterwards. The quantity of food was ridiculously small. I had a glass of wine for $12. With tax & tip: $90.  And I still need to go eat bread (which is not included i the $55, by the way) or pizza to be full.  I have been to Cotogna on a regular night, and it's much better, even though I don't believe it's worth the hype.  I actually think Zero zero has way better pizza & pasta than this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-12-31", "description": "I came here on a weekday evening a few days back expecting something pretty out of this world, judging from the reviews. My feeling here is that this restaurant was overhyped for me, so I ended up being disappointed. \n\nFirst the good points: The server was good and knew the answers to all my questions. Drinks were refilled promptly and the food came out quickly.  When I had a problem with one of the dishes, the problem was remedied quickly, without any comment but \"I hope this is more to your liking\", which I appreciated. \n\nNow the negative. I was seated at a table that was very close (about 3 inches) from the table next to me. I basically felt like I was having dinner with four other people, even though it was just me and my friend. It was way awkward.\n\nBut that I could deal with if the food was excellent. Unfortunately, it was mediocre--a bit boring. Started with the burrata, which was bland and unremarkable. Then moved to a salad--also bland and really a very tiny portion. I get that this is a high-end place, but I though it was supposed to be an unpretentious farm-to-table deal--and that's not what it seemed like.\n\nMy friend had the octopus, which he said was cooked very well. That was the bright point of the dinner. But the sides for the octopus--a bit of rice and one (yes, one) split fingerling potato, tasted like nothing. \n\nI had the quail, which was undercooked (pink in the breast). I was happy the kitchen was willing to remedy that for me, but it didn't improve the taste b/c the bird was, frankly, drenched in oil. It was all I could taste and ended up being quite an unpleasant dish as a result--very heavy and greasy.  \n\nFor desert, we had the lemon cake, which was supposed to be a pound cake, but tasted more like lemon flavored rock. It was extremely dry, which is the kiss of death for cake (unless you're talking about a dipping cake, which this was not.) \n\n My friend, meanwhile, got the butterscotch budino, which tasted overwhelmingly of raw milk--perhaps they used goat's milk? It overpowered the flavor of the butterscotch. My friend ate it, but only because he was starving after the tiny portion of octopus.  \n\nI gave this place 3 stars instead of 2 b/c the service really was good and I think we might have come there on an off night. Planning to give it another try one day, in the hopes that I have a better experience.", "author": "Sara S."}

We were charged a 20% gratuity (I understand our party was large), when the meal was truly family style--so we served ourselves. Further, our service forgot drink orders and was very slow to bring wine.\n\nWe traveled by limo and yet were charged a $12 valet fee.\n\nThe worst part to me; we were asked to leave because they needed our table. We spend over $1800--filled a table at 5pm and were asked to leave after subpar service and ridiculously priced food.\n\nWe had been at the Water Bar before we arrived exactly on time for our 5pm reservation. Water Bar was amazing, fantastic service and a quarter of the price.\n\nI would never give this place another chance. I have no problem paying \"a lot\" when the meal/service deserves it.

We ordered the brussel sprout gremolata (wood fire roasted brussel sprouts with creamy texture, cheese, breadcrumbs and lemon flavor) and Sformato (sunchoke custard -- perfectly soft yet maintained it's form topped with grana padano) which were both excellent. We tried their pizza special which was pecorino tartufo topped pizza (no sauce) with chanterelles and thinly slice apples. The crust was chewy and crisp and the toppings had a balance of salt and sweet with savory and chewy mushroom pieces. We got the Strozzapreti cacio e pepe, which had a tasty, peppery sauce but the pasta itself was a little too short and tough for our taste. We also got the Tortelli stuffed with squash served in a light butter sauce. This pasta dish was perfectly filled with a creamy, soft and smooth squash and served in a simple butter sauce; the pasta itself was cooked and then pan fried to give it a slight crisp to it, we think.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our experience (ambiance, service, and food) very much.

We were seated at the \"chef's counter\" (bar) after a long wait on a Wednesday.  We ordered the bistecca.  Our $100 steak was grilled right in front of us.  Our mouths watered.  We watched, and waited, and then, we watched as it was taken off the fire and left to \"rest\" for a bit.  And then.... it rested.  And... rested some more.  Some time later, we were served one very large steak that had been both undercooked and was cold from having been served to us so long after cooking.  We ate around the edges and whatever we could tolerate before someone came to check on us.  We sent the steak back to the kitchen.  After 5-10 minutes, it was returned us...exactly the same as it had been before. Like a marvelous steak that had been undercooked for dinner and you arrived to the dinner 20 minutes late.   We gave up and made plans to raid the fridge when we got home.  (Literally went home and ate microwaved tater tots after a $200 meal. Tear.)\n\nThe manager came over and said most of the right things (except an offer to cook us a new steak, and serve it to us hot, which would have made us happy).  Rather, after having earlier asked the waitress to be sure none of our main courses contained dairy, two dairy desserts were delivered to us on the house as recompense and two glasses of moscato.  It was a nice gesture which we appreciated, but unfortunately also missed the mark.\n\nOther impressions:  We loved the tuna appetizer although it was just too small (like a cartoon depiction of tiny food at a fancy restaurant).\n\nWe also struggled with the value of the meal relative to the dining experience.  In the end, with tip, we paid over $200 for one large steak (with beans and lettuce leaves), our tiny tuna appetizer, and two glasses of red wine.  \n\nThe stars awarded are because we felt the flavors had potential, the wine was excellent, the ambiance was charming, and management was well intentioned.", "author": "Laura K."}

So when said friend was having a landmark birthday and he wanted to go to Cotogna, I was in...even when I could only get reservations at 5PM or 9PM for the next three weeks.  9PM on a Wednesday...OK.  I steeled myself.\n\nAll the food I had was, in all honesty, pretty darned good.  I had shrimp and avocado bruschetta, which were lovely -- but a serving of two itty bitty pieces of bread?  Seriously?  I also ordered a half-chicken, which was tasty, and butterscotch pudding...also solid.  The staff were also cute when we told them it was a dinner for both our birthdays...they brought out candles on both desserts.  That was a good moment.\n\nBut I dunno.  First, there's the space.  I was aware in advance that the tables in the restaurant were all close together, and yes it was one of those not-very-satisfying experiences.  Why does anyone line up for a restaurant with no space?  Why do restaurants think this makes for success?  It's one of life's mysteries.\n\nThe wine list was a bit thin, and few wines were available by the glass.  It was also so dim in the restaurant, and the font on the menus so light and small, that just reading the selections took work.  I don't need reading glasses yet, and again -- just not fun.  There was no separate list for wines by the glass; instead they were marked by almost imperceptible little glass symbols on the single list.\n\nLastly, I had not finished my half chicken, and had it boxed.  But it was never brought back to the table, and since it was late already we just wanted to go.\n\nIf I could give 2.5 stars I would, but I'll give three for the quality of the food.

The raviolo was also very rich so it seemed like a good idea for everyone to have a bite and eat something else too.  All the food was pretty good, but there were a couple of things I particularly enjoyed:\n\nPici Tosca- noodles had just the right amount of firmness to them and the slightly sweet red sauce was pleasant.  \n\nHouse made fennel & Calabrian chili foccacini-  the rolls were slightly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a fennel flavor was prominent but not overwhelming.

It wasn't a huge amount-she probably spilled water on only one piece. She was very apologetic and we were also in turn understanding and made sure she knew it wasn't a problem. Our server saw the whole ordeal and the staff made us an entire new pizza for us to take home after the meal. Doesn't get much nicer than that! What they say is true here folks!

Went to another bar, a chic rooftop/basement joint in the TL, and another bartender also dissed the place.\n\nIn a reasonable fashion, with enough explanation to be believable.\n\nHmmm...\n\nWell, I can only do my own review, and here it is:\n\nIf I go back and have an experience in food and service that is similar to what I had today, I'd give this place five stars.\n\nThe Partner suggested the place as we set out;  describing it as \"the pizza place on the corner, that we saw walking through the financial district---people were sitting outside\".   \"Pizza place\" is not a selling point, to me, so I was resistant, and we ran through a list of places, and settled on Bottle Cap, Washington Square.\n\nAs it turns out, Bottle Cap is not open for lunch.  And, in a very bizarre turn of events, at noon, almost all the North Beach cafes along Columbus were still closed---in twenty years, I've never seen anything like it.\n\nSo, we ended up at Cotogna.  Wow.\n\nFrom appetizers to dessert, it was one of the very best meals I've had in a long time, and that includes last week's dinner at Universal Cafe, which I was very much impressed with.  This was better, still!\n\nAlong the way we ran into a friend who raved about the place and said to sit at the bar... so we did...\n\nI had the chicken liver pate, which came on slices of crusty bread ala bruschetta, which I tried to cut apart, portion by portion, but found to be so difficult to manage, I ended up biting off each segment.  I asked the bartender if the dish was meant to be finger food or not, and her response was not that helpful \"There aren't any rules, are there?\"  most of the staff wore brown Tshirts, so perhaps there weren't...  It was so good, though,  I wanted to ask for the recipe.  M had the Artichoke Sformato, which was shaped like a flan, but with a savory flavor; a gelled creme soup served vertical, solid, warm.   Impressive.\n\nBread is served by request, and I would heartily urge you to request bread.  And try not to over indulge. Oh My God...\n\nSadly, I can't remember the name of my entree, and it's not on the online menu, but, DAHLINK!  It was described as pasta stuffed with red wine braised beef, in a \"what kind of\" sauce (my words).....  I would describe it as little pasta boats of beef stew, packed with flavor, floating on a reduction of au jus...    I'm not one for stuffed pasta, but then it seems to come with cheese, most times, and this was well above the norm.  I've never had anything like it.\n\nM had the Tagliolini with dungeness crab and Meyer lemon.  I ate the latter part of it, being the fatter of the two of us.  This is a buttery dish with a delicate lemon flavor and nice big chunks of crab--and despite the rather conservative portions, which were still decent, the crab was most abundant.  Light but filling, and flavorful.\n\nWe finished with a tawny port and dessert, a meyer lemon torte with merengue (nice) and affogato. \n\nAn hour later, still walking about, looking for something to eat or drink next (we ended up at the House of Shields) we were sputtering \"My God, that was the best...\"  \"I can't believe how good that was...\"\n\n\nI read the low star reviews, and heard the arguments that the bartenders we encountered, made;  but our experience today was of a restaurant that was so good that I am at a loss to compare it to anything else we've experienced, recently.

The logic is so backwards!\n\nThe popularity of Cotogna and its sister restaurant Quince which I thoroughly enjoyed elevated my expectations quite a bit.  And the menu made me drool.  Everything looked interesting and delicious.  We made our waitress go through each item line by line to explain them in details. \n\nThree of us shared the homemade ricotta, which was baked and served with some fava beans and crispy toasts.  The ricotta is amazingly rich and tasty.  I felt as guilty as shoving butter straight down my throat, but it didn't prevent me from feeding myself one spoonful after another.  Fortunately we ordered the snow crab antipasti to balance it out.  The portion was what we expected: barely enough for three people to get a taste.  I wish I could eat a whole giant bowl all by myself: I love fresh crab with a hint of citrus flavor.\n\nYou have to request to have bread served.  Dipped in olive oil--a lazy man's dream, the focaccia was a bit too greasy for me.  It seemed excessive especially when you are already eating the ricotta antipasti. \n\nMy friend and I shared two pork and pasta plates.  One was the aglonotti stuffed with meat.  They are like delicate little dumplings.  The other was tagliatelle verdi with ragu which were broad noodles with meat sauce.  \n\nBoth were good.  Not mind blowing, but good.  Ever since I had the pasta with meat sauce at Seven Hill's, I haven't' stopped ordering pasta with meat sauce at every well reputed Italian restaurant looking for something parallel in quality.  I have yet to find one that's as good in texture and taste, unfortunately.\n\nWe opted out of dessert because we were stuffed as this point. \n\nPrices were reasonable.

Naturally, you want everything to go smoothly.  I confirmed the price of $45 as noted on their site and various sites that promoted their Sunday special.

Initially I thought it was just me however the rest of the group of 9 began commenting how it was just extremely salty for their taste.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-08", "description": "Cotogna. San Francisco's new hot spot. Situated on a beautiful block in the financial district, right next door to a little place called Quince. Rustic Italian cuisine brought to you by one of this city's most celebrated chefs, Michael Tusk.\n\nClearly, Cotogna has a lot going for it - and many people have noticed. This establishment has attracted a huge amount of attention, so much that on my first visit there was such a cloud of hype surrounding this restaurant that it was hard to even see the front door. Having dined at Quince several times, I had always left with the feeling that, while delicious, it never quite lived up to its widespread publicity. So, in all honesty, I walked into Cotogna with a bit of an attitude, entering with my chin held high as if to say, \"Okay hot shot. Impress me.\"\n\nAnd let me tell you...it did. As much as I wanted to be underwhelmed, everything about my three dining experiences amazed me. \n\nAlthough the menu may seem rustic and relaxed, the plates that come out of the kitchen are sophisticated. I was hooked as soon as I took my first bite of the starters: a Salad of Chicories with pomegranate, olio nuovo & burrata ($10), and a serving of Grilled Monterey Bay Squid with grapefruit & puntarella ($10). The salad, while uncomplicated, was perfectly balanced, refreshing, and not overly dressed; much can be said about a restaurant that serves impeccable salads. The calamari was perfectly executed - not rubbery at all and incredibly juicy.\n\nNext came the pastas, the most notable of which is the Farm Egg Raviolo with brown butter ($16) - also the most decadent dish of the meal. A beautiful, delicate farm egg is cooked in 180 degree water for 2-3 minutes, until the yolk is runny enough to spill slightly when cut, but firm enough to not run out over the entire plate. \n\nSkip the pizza. However, a side order of Ember Roasted Onions with fonduta & hazelnut ($6) left a lasting impression on my mouth (that's what she said...) Smothered in cream and layered with different textures, a simple onion became supple, rich, smoky, and outstanding.\n\nSPIT ROASTED PORK with wild fennel & hot pepper ($24) came as an entr\u00e9e, and absolutely blew me away. I usually don't adore simple, roasted meats, but this pork loin was so moist and so well-seasoned that for me it is one of the most stand-out dishes on the menu.\n\nFinally, but importantly, the desserts. After 1 bite of the Cr\u00e8me Fraiche Panna Cotta with pinenut cookies ($7), it's clear that this is not a place where you should skip dessert. \n\nDon't expect to walk in and be seated within 15 minutes; the wait at Cotogna, even on a weeknight, looks more like 60-90 minutes. It doesn't matter who you are, if you don't have a reservation you're going to wait. But the food is worth it. Luckily, there's a wonderful bar right next door in Quince to make that wait a little less painful.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

However, something has changed.  I haven't been back for some time, over a year actually, until tonight for a Sunday Supper prix fixe headlined by roast duck.  I was shocked at the mediocrity of the food.  The salad was bland, overly oiled, and quite small (come on, people, these ingredients are CHEAP).  The pasta with bay shrimp was just OK; the shrimp tasted fishy rather than fresh and sweet and the pasta a little overdone.  But the roast duck was an abysmal failure---tough tho medium rare and the Buddha's Hand flavored sauce was salty and not distinguished in the least.  Your typical Chinese roast duck in Oakland or Clement street is a far better dish.  Finally the tart for dessert was fine.  Service, too, has deteriorated.  It seemed as if there weren't enough waitstaff.  Out sick maybe?  At any rate, at a cost of 100/person incl gratuities, I expected much better.  I am willing to try this again perhaps for lunch sometime, but if things aren't back to 4*-5* levels, I am done.

You absolutely have to! it is AMAZING... sea salt and red pepper flakes. fresh out of the oven. mmm. SO GOOD. moist and buttery and melts in your mouth. Strange way to describe bread, but it was truly heavenly.\n\nWe shared:\n\n1. House made ricotta with 490 rooftop honey, apple/pear compote & crostini - the crostini was pretty much as delicious as the house bread.. But had the charcoal grill taste! Lovely. Ricotta was warm, interestingly. and yellow, apparently from the honey? Anyway, I loved the pear compote particularly. This appetizer was lick your fingers clean yummy!\n \n2. Cannelloni with chicken/mushroom in some cheesy creamy sauce - very rich and creamy.. Very decadent... But oh so good! I couldn't tell if I was eating mushrooms or chicken fat bits at some point though, it was certainly a bit strange. The sauce had spinach (?) bits in it, and was slightly salty.\n\n3. Pork loin/belly + brussel sprouts/potatoes - I forget the fancy name for this dish, but the pork was fork-tender. Very well done. Potatoes had a roasted flavor! Delicious.. I love brussel sprouts too so nothing else to be said.\n\n4. Cavalo nero ''alla parmigiana'' - very cheesy and creamy too.. cavalo nero reminded me somewhat of kale. We were trying to be healthy.\n\nAnyway, pity we had no room for dessert, am sure it would've been awesome too.. This was way more than enough food for two of us small Asian girls, thank goodness I anticipated that and desisted from ordering more.", "author": "Clarissa L."}

The mezzaluna was so light and delicate and the parpardelle was hearty and flavorful.\n\nThen we shared a pizza with pork sausage and cheese and some greens. Very nice but we were getting full at this point!\n\nhowever, I could not pass up dessert which was a chocolate caramel tart w/ some kind of ice cream. It was delicious but very small!

Quince has Cotogna. \n\nCotogna is every bit if not more popular than its parent restaurant next door. A walk by here and the brick walls are bouncin! The FinDi/Jackson Square after hours crowd and anyone with taste buds for Quince quality + the budget for something more affordable are making this casual rendition a winner.\n\nA reservation (call at least a week ahead if you want to eat earlier than 9pm!) will get you your own private table. But, if you happen to be in the area and don't mind waiting for 45 minutes to an hour, their communal table is an open free for all. Is it worth it? Does a complimentary glass of Prosecco ease one's irritability while waiting by a drafty door? With a slight buzz and a little warmth in the belly, I'd have to say YES!\n\nThe key to this place is sampling. Dishes range anywhere from $6-$24, all wine is $10 a glass and mixed drinks $9. Their inventive combinations of ingredients make it so hard to choose. However, the noise level is a bit high (great for a fun night out, but not for an intimate dinner), so forget about arguing over what to order, just order a bunch! My fave of the night: Gnocchi with dungeness crab & English peas. They were so soft, I'd lay my weary head down on those pillows any day!\n\nAt the end of the night, bellies full, a walk back up to Telegraph Hill made me think that valeting the car from 5 blocks away would have been lazy, but perhaps worth it!", "author": "Kira R."}

So here goes:\n\nWent on August 28th for the Cotogna Sunday Supper ($45 prix fixe).  Though we were there before our 6pm reservation, the room was already at least 2/3rd full.  We were seated immediately.\n\n-  The room is quite nice: lots of light, easy-relaxed decor, not too loud.\n\n-  Was troubled by the fact that we had to ask for bread (though others had some), and after finally getting the bread, having to actually ask for butter.  The waitstaff said \"I guess we have some somewhere\" and seemed quite perplexed that we'd need some.  After much consternation she finally brought a ramekin of some very nice olive oil.\n\n - The first course was shaved summer vegetable salad w/fried Monterey Bay anchovies.  From a plating, flavor and portion perspective this item was perfection.  Well-balanced and fresh.\n\n- Second course was artichoke cappelletti w/dry farmed Tomatero Farm tomato fresh marjoram and pecorino toscano.  The pasta was FABULOUS (nicely filled, just past al dente, luscious mouth feel) but there wasn't enough of the little fried artichoke garnish on top of mine.\n\n- The entree of spit roasted beef w/La Tercera Farm shelling beans and sweet peppers cooked to a textbook medium rare (and very juicy) but, I hate to say it, BORING.   The balance was off:  too much meat, in proportion to the shelling beans and the peppers.  Maybe the dish needed some acid -- it certainly needed a different texture (soft meat, soft peppers and soft beans do not thrill).   Though I thought it was OK, my dining partner found the sides so poorly cooked she couldn't finish it.\n\n- The dessert of millefoglio w/Knoll Farm Kadota figs, pastry cream and rooftop honey was the best dish of the night, by far.  Light, airy, full of flavor, with the crisp pastry layers playing off the soft yummy pastry cream wonderfully.  Wish I'd paired it with a cappucino --- that would have been smart.\n\nWould have to give it a \"B\".  I MUCH PREFER Quince, despite the much higher price point next door.\n\nMay try it again, but ala carte.", "author": "Lana C."}

Loved all the wood accents and open oven.  It'd be great to sit at the counter and watch the chefs in action, especially on a chilly night.  As we were being seated the manager noticed the Hookers Sweet Treats we'd brought our friend and commented.  The night off to a good start we thought...  \n\nWe began with cocktails.  The Voodoo Child:  Jamaican & Haitian Rums, Elderflower, Grapefruit, Chili Potion, very refreshing.  The Viceroy:  Reposado Tequila, Pineapple, Gentian, really nice flavor combination.  Our friend running late...we ordered 2 appetizers:  Warm ricotta with wild mushrooms & crostini.  Generous portion of spread and toasted crostini, yum!  Local halibut crudo with grapefruit & olives.  Really fresh, great combination with the fresh citrus.  The manager stopped by to inform us of later reservations as he was concerned about the time.  Our friend on the way, we ordered the grilled miyagi oysters with meyer lemon mignonette.  This was a great dish and the winning appetizer.  The mignonette was fresh and bright, the perfect complement to the briny oysters.  Could have had an order each!  The manager stopped by a second time to remind us of later reservations.  Huh?  The second reminder was annoying.  We're ordering food and cocktails...  Our friend just called to say he's parking...  We're ready to order main courses...  and look, here he is coming in the door.  \n\nNext we ordered thin crust pizza with House made pork sausage, rapini & hot pepper to share while our entrees were being fired.  The pizza was great, loved the chewy crust.  For entrees we ordered:  California sea bass with puntarelle, citrus & Tierra Farm cannellini beans.  Gnocchi with Calabrian sausage & broccoli, light and fluffy...no belly bombers here.  Sonoma lamb shank with farro & blue foot mushrooms with gremolata.  Generous portion of perfectly roasted lamb.  We all enjoyed the entrees, not a bite left on any ones' plate.  Since it was a celebration, we stayed for coffee and a sweet treat.  We shared two desserts recommended by our server Colette.

My friend and I, having been servers ourselves before, understand when things are busy that you can't go to your customers RIGHT away... However, it was ridiculous how long we had to wait.\n\nWhen we were able to order, I ordered the prix fixe and my friend ordered the Pappardelle with braised lamb. My first course from the prix fixe came--it was roasted tomato soup with croutons & basil. It was a pretty big size. I had never had tomato soup before, so I had to refer to my friend for her opinion. She said that it was a bit watered down, the color even looked watered down and it should have been thicker. However, the olive oil in the soup was pretty flavorful. I was surprised at how the croutons kept their crisp in the soup. Overall, it was okay. Also, it was lukewarm when it came out. I like my soup hot...\n\nThe free garlic with olive oil bread was pretty good with the soup, too. However, again, it wasn't warm... and I like my bread warm.\n\nThe second course wood oven roasted mussels with guanciale & fennel. I was out of luck on this prix fixe dinner, because I don't even like mussels. But, since it was on the 7x7 list, I had to order it. The mussels were alright--but I am biased since I don't like mussels. The mussel shells were surprisingly brittle though. They kept breaking. The broth that the mussels were in was pretty delicious, though. Great for dunking the crispy bread that came with the dish. I loved the bits of pork (bacon?) in the broth. \n\nMy friend's pasta dish was a bit salty, I felt. It was very small for something that was $15+. I liked the pappardelle pasta itself, though. It was clearly fresh- and home-made. \n\nLast was the dessert. For me, the prix fixe came with affogato ---- warm espresso poured over vanilla gelato. It sounded delicious.... The gelato was good, but the espresso was too bitter. It was really, really strong. If it were lighter, I think the dessert could have been better.\n\nMy friend had ordered Bomboloni with ricotta, blueberries & limoncello sauce, which was my favorite thing that night.

Simple but obvious they are using high quality ingredients\n\n- Pizza w/ uni, cauliflower, and jalapeno: probably the least favorite of the night. We were intrigued so we had to order it.  The pizza crust is really good, so I would recommend pizzas in general, but with different toppings.  Somehow it just didn't seem right to put the uni and cauliflower together, on a pizza no less.  Interesting concept...\n\n- Raviolo di ricotta w/ farm egg & brown butter: really rich so it was great for sharing. how they do this I don't know, but this dish is amazing\n\n- spit roasted pork - not as seasoned/flavorful as I had imagined, but still  juicy and the natural pork flavor was obvious.  a good dish\n\n- braised rabbit w/ capers, peppers, and polenta: my favorite of the evening!  Super tender rabbit and delicious polenta.  Everything was well-seasoned.  I typically have not liked rabbit in the past, but Cotogna's version was not very gamey, and almost like a cross between pork and chicken.  Very well executed.\n\n- Panna cotta with champagne grapes and saba: a very simple but elegant dessert.  The panna cotta was very smooth and creamy. Not too sweet and the grapes/saba were a great complement.\n\nAll these dishes and the bill came out to just under $90 before tip.

And when the friend I originally intended to take here for my birthday asked to postpone, I made another reservation but did NOT cancel this one!  Just called another friend to come along!\n\nI arrived early and ordered a glass of wine at the bar.  I think it was an Umbria Rosso.  Very tasty.   Love their wine prices too!  The bartenders were great keeping my water glass filled. \n\nMy friend arrived and  we were seated promptly.  Naturally we both had to order the Prix Fixe.  Afterall it was what drew me in.  \n\nThe 1st course was artichoke sformato with parmigiana fonduta.  For whatever reason, I didn't expect it to be warm.  A welcome surprise.  The smoothness and flavor were also top notch.\n\nI'd read the fine print from the bottom of the menu and remembered to ask for bread.  Heavenly focaccia with the bottom dipped in olive oil.  It was so good we asked nicely for a second round later in the meal.\n\nThe main course was tagliatelle with duck sugo.  Their pasta is pretty good.  Excellent texture and the duck had amazing flavors.\n\nWe also ordered fried pumpkin & sage and Brussels sprouts with gremolata.  Enjoyed both of them but especially the former as I hadn't had fried sage in quite a while.  Good memories.\n\nFor dessert, we were served a warm pink lady apple & almond crostata.  The honey drizzled on the plate was the right touch.  \n\nIt is a very comfortable restaurant.  The only problem was the volume in the restaurant.  But I'll be headed back towards the end of the month because, in the end, its really all about the food.", "author": "J. P."}

I have had some of the best pasta dishes in my life at Quince (and I have eaten my way through Italy a couple of times).  However, that place is very expensive and servings are small.  \nI use to walk past Cotogna on my way home from work, and the wood burning fire acted as a siren song.  \nAfter three trips, I have some advice.  Avoid the pizzas.  They are not that great.  You should be going to Cotogna for the pasta.  In fact, make it easy on yourself and just order every pasta on the menu.  The spit-fired pork is solid (I am a sucker for anything cook over wood), but if you are deciding bw the pork or another pasta dish, go with the pasta.", "author": "pablo e."}

The place has a nice vibe; the service was borderline horrendous.  After sitting, we ordered wine within maybe 15 minutes, but then were ignored for almost another 30 minutes before finally ordering food.  We ordered three courses (and spoke to the waitress to discuss what would come out when).  Our first course, the burrata, came fairly quickly.  It was good - but then again, it's pretty tough to mess up burrata.  Then approximately 45 (!!!) minutes passed and out came...the third course.  They had skipped our second dish, the raviolo.  Once we brought the mistake to their attention (I don't know that they would have realized it had we not mentioned it), our raviolo came out quickly.  So there we were, with three dishes on our tiny table - exactly what we didn't want to happen.  \n\nThe agnolotti was our favorite, and the filling was deliciously meaty.  I think it lacked a little something (more parm on top? a more interesting sauce?), but you can't deny the yumminess of that rabbit/veal/pork center.  The wine recommended by our waitress was also spot-on.  But those small victories don't make up for being completely ignore for long stretches of time (a meal for 2 should not last for 2 hours and 15 minutes...unless it's by design, and this was clearly not) and the letdown of the other dishes.  In particular, the raviolo, which always seems to get rave reviews, was just okay.  The ricotta was light and creamy and i enjoyed the runny egg, but the pasta part was a too chewy and the \"sauce\" was completely lacking, if it existed at all.  Maybe I've been spoiled by Seven Hill's version of the same dish, which comes in a brown butter sauce that I have been known to dream about on occasion.  \n\nWhen I crave delicious and inventive homemade pastas, I'll stick with SPQR, Zero Zero, F+W, or Seven Hills - Cotogna simply can't live up to any of them.", "author": "Katherine B."}

The fish didn't taste fishy to me and the grapefruit was very sweet.\n- Radicchio, burrata & pomegranate - Nice choice of colors in this salad.  Good, but a bit bitter for me, but the bf liked it.\n- PIZZE - Farm egg with pancetta & brussels sprouts - Flavorful - The brussels sprouts weren't bitter at all.\n- Tagliolini with dungeness crab, lime & hot pepper - The pasta was al dente and I liked the chewy texture of it.  You could really taste the crab flavor and lime in the dish.\n- Affogato ---- warm espresso poured over vanilla gelato - The ice cream was good, but the espresso was wayy too bitter for me.  As you can tell I don't really like bitter foods.  My bf really liked it though, comparable to Blue Bottle's version.\n- Valrhona chocolate tart & peanut brittle - Creamy chocolate and yummy peanut brittle.\n\nOverall, I really liked this place, probably almost as much as Flour + Water.

I know it's unfair when the bar has been set pretty high in what one is expecting, however, Cotogna was far from meeting the mark.  Recommended by former natives of San Francisco back home in Denver as well as reading highly regarded reviews, my girlfriend demanded that this restaurant must be included as a dinner spot on our recent trip.  \n\nWe strolled in between 4 and 5 hoping we could capitalize on some happy hour drinks and food to constitute as dinner.  Much to no avail, there was no happy hour.  Since the entr\u00e9e menu looked pretty scarce (4 items), we figured a bunch of appetizers would suffice.  Grabbing a seat at the bar, I must admit our drinks were pretty exceptional despite the arrogance and prickish demeanor of the bartender.  Inquiring about specific items on the menu, the bartender looked at us as if we were speaking another language.  He swiped the menus out of our hands midsentence when we asked about an item that apparently was on the lunch menu realizing he gave us the wrong menu.  The abrasive action was not even followed with a response to our inquiry or an explanation.  To cap off his far from approachable manner, we were witness to an argument between him and a server who requested a taste of a liqueur that made up a drink upon her customer's request.  He refused and belittled the server for requesting this on behalf of an actual customer, saying \"it's a liqueur...we don't give tastes of it\" to which the server mentioned to him to just make it and deduct her paycheck if the customer doesn't want it.  That is a testament that not all of the servers there are similar to the bartender which is an optimistic take of our dinner experience.\n\nOrdering four appetizers amongst the two of us, we were a bit annoyed that each item came out separately.  It would have been nice to mix and match between the apps, but now I'm just splitting hairs.  The burrata and farro was by far the highlight and the most substantial of all the four appetizers and probably the only one that constituted a $12 price tag.  The grilled \"gems\" was two measly spears of lettuce grilled with some Caesar dressing while the asparagus appetizer was similarly meager in nature.  After consuming our drinks and inadequately portioned appetizers for an exorbitant price tag of $90 , I ate as much bread as possible to sustain a walk back to our hotel which might I say was met with a snack break along the way.", "author": "Nick C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-22", "description": "Given Michael Tusk's recent award from the James Beard foundation for being the best chef in the Pacific region I decided to dine at Cotogna recently.  Despite the scathing review that my two chef friends had given the restaurant I was still very excited to dine there.  Unfortunately, my chef friends' assessment was spot on.  The food at Cotogna was just not that good . . . plain and simple.\n\nMy meal began with the heirloom tomatoes with local albacore tuna.  I am all for the slow food, farm to table movement, and allowing good ingredients to speak for themselves (i.e., you don't need to drown good ingredients with lots of sauces, spices, etc.).  That being said, the heirloom tomato & tuna salad needed some flavor help in a big way.  The dish was flat, rather bland, and completely forgettable.\n\nHoping that the heirloom tomato & tuna salad was just going to an aberration in an otherwise spectacular meal, I moved on to the Monterey Bay squid with chili & mint.  I am a huge fan of squid, especially our local variety, and thus was doubly disappointed by this dish.  The heat of the dish was good but it was poorly conceived.  The mint didn't work with other bitter greens which accompanied the squid and each bite of the mint overpowered any other flavor that was supposed to come through.  Particularly egregious was the fact that the dish was over salted.\n\nKeeping my optimism alive, I moved on with enthusiasm to the pork sausage, wild nettles & ricotta pizza.  This pizza was unlike any other wood oven pizza I've had . . . and not in a good way.  I don't know if Michael Tusk opted not to use the conventional \"00\" flour or what but the pizza's dough didn't have the right consistency of crispy on the outside/soft in the inside.  Further, given the sparse nature of the toppings, there wasn't much flavor to the pizza as most bites where just dough and it was rare to get a bite that actually had all three toppings in it.\n\nFor my fourth course, I had the pappardelle with braised lamb sugo.  When I took my first bite of this dish I knew that all the previous errors were not aberrations but rather part of a pattern indicative of poorly conceived (and in some cases poorly executed) dishes.  The pasta was bland.  All the flavor that really came through was the cheese the chef sprinkled on top (not by request).  I would not recommend this dish to any subsequent diner.\n\nCotogna wasn't all bad.  My server was quite good - and very attentive.  I also love the way they've constructed their wine list.  No matter what wine you order, a glass is $10 and a bottle is $40.  Plus, they are very accommodating in allowing you to try several of their wines before ultimately making your selection. \n\nI'm still optimistic that Michael Tusk is every bit the chef he is regarded as being.  I'll just have to taste the food at Quince to find out for sure.", "author": "Oski B."}

The decor was inviting and rustic, with an open wood burning oven. \n\n We started with the \"Warm Ricotta w/ wild Mushrooms & crostini. I loved it. The \"dip\" was perfect to spread on a fire toasted buttered crostini. They even gave us more crostini when they noticed we had devoured it all.  \n\nFor our entree, we shared the \"Raviolo de ricotta w/ farm egg & brown butter\" and \"Tagliolini w/ dungeness crab\". The first was one single large ravioli drowned in butter with a runny egg on top. They even included a long piece of focaccia bread, which was advised to use to mop up the extra brown butter sauce. I quickly obliged and followed their instructions. Buttery goodness. The tagliolini was lighter; pasta tossed in a light sauce sprinkled with crab meat. The pasta was delicate enough to allowed the essence of the crab to come through.\n\nOverall both dishes were rich, yet still pleasant to the palate without being too overpowering. However, I don't think I could not have eaten the ravioli on my own, as it would have been just too buttery even if my stomach disagreed and tried to convince  me to continue. I don't think my body could have handled all that richness in one meal. So I had to resist and take the rest of the Tagliolini to go. (it was still good reheated the next day!)\n\nOverall it was a delicious meal. I believe butter was the star of this lunch, so if you're a health nut, you may want to avoid the ravioli and focaccia bread combo. If you just want to bask in all the richness and glory of soulful food, then just dive right in and enjoy it.\n\nUnfortunately, I had to get back to work after lunch and was in a food coma for the rest of the afternoon.

I just did not feel like eating after 9:00PM. \n\nMy husband and I found street parking easily and were happy that they were able to seat us on time. Our menus came and I glanced at the wine list. Was surprised to find that all bottles on the list were $40 each and $10 for a glass of wine. I immediately spied a Niebbiolo by the glass and had to order it. Was not disappointed and quite happy to begin the evening with a glass of Niebbiolo. \n\nNext came the food selection. We started with Squash Blossoms filled with Ricotta and Zucchini. I was a little disappointed with this dish as it felt like it lacked salt or something and I am not someone who would usually add salt to my dishes. We also got the Grilled Melon with Roasted Peppers and Prosciutto. The melon was grilled to sweet perfection and I think this is one of those dishes that you cannot really mess up. \n\nNext came Pappardelle with Braised Wild Boar and both my husband and I thought the noodles were just too al dente for us. I think they could have cooked the noodles maybe another 1-2 minutes. We also shared the Gnocchetti with Cauliflower, Bottarga and Breadcrumbs. The Gnocchetti was light and fluffy and I have to say the texture was perfect. But, again the sauce lacked flavor. I think they were going for a clean summer taste but it just lacked that dimension in flavor. \n\nBy this time, we only had room to share the main course and ordered the Spit Roasted Becker Lane Pork Loin. The pork loin was absolutely delicious! The meat was so flavorful and tender, it made us forget about the previous dishes leading up to the main course. \n\nOh, we can't leave without trying dessert. We ordered the Panna Cotta and Chocolate Caramel Tart. The Panna Cotta was perfect but the Chocolate Caramel Tart was so good, I will always remember it.

It wasn't anything I was super excited about.  Since there was a problem on the Bay Bridge, I was stuck in gridlock traffic, so my friend called to let them know.  Their response was \"ok, but you need to be done by 730 because we have another reservation coming in.\"  Who does that?!  I understand that you have seating times, but is that really the best way to communicate it to your guests?  We were only 30 minutes late, and when we were seated, the hostess told us that our server was informed of our time \"constraint\".  When we first got there, the valet guy wasn't very helpful, then the hostess greeted us with \"can I help you?\"  Normally, one would say \"welcome, how are you this evening.\"  This place is lightyears away from Quince in every single aspect.\n\nWe were seated next to an older couple, and they were getting lots of extras from the staff.  I'm assuming he was the floor manager, but I wouldn't know since he never once introduced himself to us.  He did come to our table and ask if we had any questions.  We had one, he answered it, then he just stood there.  So I asked \"are you here to take our order\" and he replied with \"sure, I can do that\".  \n\nI don't know if I just had astronomical expectations (as one would when you know it's a Tusk restaurant), but I was completely underwhelmed, as was the couple next to us.  And they weren't anyone special or knew anyone at the restaurant (I asked).  They were also not impressed and felt no need to return.\n\nThe other thing that really bugged me was that the other table next to us (you're packed in there like sardines), has a late-comer as well (she was stuck in the same traffic), but the staff didn't rush them along.  I was really put off at the inconsistent service.  We're all paying the same amount for the same food, so why would I get treated any differently.\n\nGiven all of the service issues, the food needed to be out of this world in order for me to come back.  Again, it wasn't.  It was sort of lackluster and seemed mundane.  The only thing I had that I actually really liked, was the pork shoulder.  Other than that, my friend didn't like her crab pasta and we both thought the appetizers (squid salad and halibut tartare) were something you could get anywhere.\n\nThen, when we're leaving, we gave our valet ticket to our server and she said our car will be brought around.  We're standing outside, not quite sure where we should be waiting, so we asked the valet, where we should wait.  His response was \"your car's coming\", in a not very nice tone.  One - that wasn't my question, and two - I know it's coming.  After the dining experience we had, it was quite bad form.\n\nMaybe things are different at lunch, but I don't think I'll be going again to find out.

It is not as comfortable as it sounds.\n\n- The noise on weekends is so intense you will have to bring a megaphone to communicate with the friend/partner in crime sitting next/in front of you. Texting is another option you might consider. \n\n- Pizzas are ok, a bit on the soggy side, all overpriced and hyped to the ninth degree. \"Sea urchin, Cauliflower sauce pizza is very popular in Italy\" states with a -matter-of-fact tone the uber-waiter who has never been to Italy. \"Er, what? Since when?\" asks the Italian customer who has worked in a pizzeria and lived there for 20+ years. Nothing wrong about being intrepid with pizza recipes. But there's a difference between facts and fiction.\n\nBetter options: Beretta, Bar Bambino, Barbacco.\n\nPredictions: Cotogna will be passe' two months from now.", "author": "Matt B."}

The waitress had an awful attitude, complaining we were using too much glassware and just overall rude and slow.

The meal had some definitive highlights (duck ravioli, pistachio flan wow) but for being a special evening didn't really have too much of a personal touch. We were given our check and no instructions about where to get our signed cookbooks we paid for. Waiter was at least nice this time, just absent and impersonal.

ESQUIRE had sung its praises, and i was ready for something special.  In the end, I found it to be better than average, but certainly not worth the money.  \n\nFirst impression--boring to look at, but hopping, with a relatively young crowd and lots of people being turned away.  Waitress was very sweet and had memorized the menu, but she was very young, took 15 minutes to bring even water and only brought bread (after 40 minutes) when i asked if they had any (and the bread was one of the best things I experienced!).  The chef clearly controls everything (I ordered a standard type of gin and was told that they only carried one specific brand--same with my friend's requested brand of Scotch), which is sort of pompous, yet kind of what I'm paying for.  The wines by the glass are all $10, and both of the sommelier's selections were very good.\n\nThe food took a long time (I understand they were busy), but there was very little follow up, even when our drinks and appetizer plate sat empty.  The recommended appetizer was nothing but sliced cold cuts, and the main courses were good (lamb and steak), but were small in size and not particularly good cuts of meat.  Sides were very good, and the dessert was fine.\n\nOverall, Cotogna was good but not great, and for a tab of over $175 for two, I expect memorable.  I'm guessing if I'd had a different meal, I might have liked the restaurant more, but compared to other Italian places in the Bay Area and Napa, I can't say I'd ever give them a second chance.  The place is certainly popular, and I'm glad I gave it a shot, but for my money, there are many better places to go in a city filled with wonderful food.", "author": "michael r."}

Great food and friendly ambiance, which is important to me. In contrast, we were early for our Rez and stopped by Quince next door for a drink. I don't recall ever stepping into a restaurant with a less inviting vibe. It was staid and boring. Couldn't wait to leave and felt they too couldn't wait for us to leave.

The slices were charred outside augmented with rock salt yet inside was tender and juicy. \n- Wine: there were 3 glasses ordered at our table and we loved them all thanks to stellar suggestions from the staff.

But what I've never done is order it at a non-Japanese restaurant (and I'm not including the more-often-than-not disastrous fusion restaurants in this category). Until I dined at Cotogna.\n\nBeing an Italian restaurant, I was not expecting to see the Japanese staple on their menu. But it's there. On a PIZZA, no less. Always up for trying \"weird\" foods and combinations of food, I just had to order it. Now that I've tasted it, I wonder, why wasn't this done sooner? And I wish more pizzerias would include sea urchin as a topping choice. The bright yellow uni was fresh and tasted incredible - sweet, briny, and not fishy at all. The very crispy and very thin crust was a nice contrast to the creamy sea urchin, as was the chopped cauliflower. Absolutely divine!\n\nPart of me would've liked to make a meal out of sea urchin pizza alone, but I resisted the temptation. (Though I probably should have, since I ended up ordering way too much food for 2 people!) We started with the SPINACH SFORMATO WITH GRANA PADANO FONDUTA (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=1qWsXB4HJKeVoYmLzMF4mg). The creamy sformato had great spinach flavour and a lovely custardy texture. It paired well with the supertasty sharp grana pandano sauce--I mopped my plate clean with my bread! Next was the HALIBUT TARTARE WITH BLOOD ORANGE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=9nVVWunZoBDUGVn-SHdr1Q). The halibut was fresh and the blood orange provided good acidity. It was tasty but nothing that memorable.\n\nFrom the pasta selection we chose 4. Michael Tusk is definitely a master with pasta. The long ribbons of the TAGLIOLINI WITH DUNGENESS CRAB (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=Ze34agt4SfFDovy9Q8hq8g) were cooked to a perfect al dente and had a great chew to it that you would never get from boxed pasta. Dressed with a light cream sauce and loaded with chunks of fresh Dungeness crab, this seemingly simple dish hit all the right notes. I had some of the best gnocchi ever in the ROSEMARY GNOCCHI WITH BRAISED DUCK (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=LGzixYNay7u9apb1qvDyXw), so soft and fluffy it was like chewing on pillows--without getting feathers caught between your teeth! Along with the hearty and flavourful sauce this was the ultimate comfort food. The LAMB PAPPARDELLE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=9ce94fA9M8uMo9W6rBNQLQ) was another winner. The wide ribbons of pappardelle were perfectly al dente and slid over my tongue like silk. This was great with the rich sauce and tender chunks of lamb. However, the TROFIE DELLA CASA CON VONGOLE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=9T0KwoUT4zoN2xjbggmYCA) missed the mark for me. The squid ink pasta was too hard for my taste and wasn't very flavourful. It looked cool though.\n\nAfter devouring the marvelous PIZZA WITH SEA URCHIN, CAULIFLOWER & SICILIAN CHILI (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=5GsiRAwud8GiPP8STQbLwQ), I was persuaded to try another and I chose the PIZZA WITH WILD NETTLE, EGG & PECORINO (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=nNdgUXs5D4_YkxZFIgLlXw). This wasn't bad but it paled in comparison to the sea urchin pizza. The herbaceous and grassy wild nettle was good, as was the fried egg in the middle. I couldn't help but feel something was missing though; some form of acid would've better balanced the richness of the cheese and egg.\n\nWe also got 2 sides. The CARROTS & PARSNIP ROASTED WITH HONEY & ANISE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=0KVYYnbYeb_4YFkt3jIlEg) were very sweet, which I liked. I usually don't really like anise but it worked here. Though our server recommended the FRIED PUMPKIN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=c5EH7CJL_f8PnGrweBpXGg) I wasn't very impressed with it. The pumpkin was bland and undercooked. I also didn't like the thick breading.\n\nEven though we were stuffed at this point, what's a meal without dessert? The CR\u00c8ME FRAICHE PANNA COTTA WITH PINENUT COOKIES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=HgJ9n6JaDvuHkPg1V90k2A) was very, very rich. I loved the smooth and creamy consistency of the panna cotta but I wanted more tang from the cr\u00e8me fraiche (the pomegranate seeds helped a little). At least the pinenut cookies were very pinenutty. The BONET WITH CARAMEL & AMARETTI CRUMBLE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HVJdo4f_6MxkM_1aCAK3NA?select=jSL1NJICU3M3-4qgBdJ7hQ) was much better. Basically a cr\u00e8me caramel, the silky smooth custard was lighter than the panna cotta and so good with the caramel sauce.

I've heard rave reviews about this place, mostly by my good friend Cristofer P, but I have to say I was slightly disappointed.\n\nCame here with the girlfriend on a Saturday (with a reservation) and ordered the bread with fresh ricotta and jam, the mortadella, pappardelle with boar ragu, and the poached egg with prosciutto. \n\nThe bread with jam and ricotta was a great start to the meal, with some unique jams (huckleberry, strawberry and one other I can't remember), and a great, smooth ricotta with some honey drizzled over the top. The mortadella was equally delicious, though I agree with my girlfriend in that the fried pieces of dough would have been better swapped just for some nice toast points. \n\nThe poached egg with cheese fonduta, prosciutto and Brussels sprouts was great, with two perfectly poached eggs with delicious runny yolks. Was a great combination, and easy to share between two.\n\nAs for the pappardelle, it was a disaster. It came off as overly salty due to the reduced liquid in the ragu combining with the Parmesan cheese grated over the top. Worse than that was the fact that there was too much oil/fat in the ragu, and after eating it for maybe five minutes, a gross skin developed on the liquid at the bottom of the plate surrounding the otherwise well made pasta (as in the noodles, not pasta as in the entire dish). Not good eats, nor very appetizing. And you know that feeling when there's too much oil in your mouth...yea...yuck.\n\nI for one, will not be coming back anytime soon after the disaster of the pappardelle, baring some amazing turnaround. I know it seems silly to avoid a place because of one dish, but I mean if it's not good don't serve it! It reflects badly on the entire kitchen!\n\nPros: Delicious mortadella, great service, and for the most part good Italian food.\n\nCons: Salty, greasy pasta dish.

High ceilings, lots of glass, casual but refined atmosphere\n\nThe Cons: \n* Waiting 40 minutes for our table despite having a reservation. We were given complimentary prosecco to ease our wait (bonus!) but it was still a long wait. \n\nOverall: \nI'd come back but probably not for a little while. I'd like the hype to die down a tad so that I can secure a reservation more easily. :)", "author": "Madeline N."}

We started with chicories, radish, egg and bagna cauda, and the chicken liver crostini. Both were very good, and I have to say I loved the texture and flavor of the chicken liver. Then we had the sausage and caramelized fennel pizza which was awesome. It was cooked to perfection. I would say that I prefer the fennel sausage at Pizzeria Mozza in LA, but this one was definitely delish too. For dessert, I had the Valrhona hot chocolate with a vanilla marshmallow. I think it may have been a perfect dessert for the cold SF weather. Overall, the meal was good, and I really want to come for Sunday supper soon.", "author": "Sheeva G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-27", "description": "I've heard so much about Cotogna -- on Yelp, in magazines and newspapers, on food blogs, billboards, carrier pigeons, etc. -- and I've been waiting so long to try it.  Even once we were able to make reservations, our long wait still continued -- we weren't able to get a table until 10:00pm on a Saturday night.\n\nSince we couldn't get a table until 10, we assumed that the restaurant would be relatively small, but Cotogna was pretty decent-sized, and all the tables were full when we got there.  We got there about 10 minutes late -- parking around there sucked -- but it was no problem for the hostess.  We had to wait less than 5 minutes to be seated.  \n\nWhen we sat down, we really liked the warmth and feel of the place, and the lighting was just right for the restaurant (unlike the odd lighting at some restaurants, like Circa).  The menu was simple and the prices reasonable, but everything looked really good.  We also appreciated how all the wines on the wine list were $40 and wine by the glass was $10.  No need to worry about ruining a well-priced meal with WAY overpriced wine!  Nevertheless, we were both in a cocktail mood, so my wife (who has been obsessed with blood oranges for what seems like the last 5 years) had the Valentino and I (being Thai and loving all things spicy) had the Voodoo Chile.  Both cocktails were good -- the rum + grapefruit + elderflower combo in my drink were very good, although I would've liked a bit more spiciness in my drink.  \n\nSince it was on the 7x7 list, I had the $24 prix fixe menu, while my wife ordered the warm ricotta with artichokes and onions and the tagliatelle with the duck ragu.  My appetizer was a very nice asparagus soup, with croutons, pepper and olive oil, and it had a delicious taste of fresh, young asparagus.  The warm ricotta appetizer was a bit surprising, in a good way, because there were 4 nice crostinis, next to a warm pot of ricotta, onions, and artichokes.  The waitress told us that the ricotta was housemade, and it was delightful, with just the right amount of salt.  \n\nThe pasta we got were also great.  The pasta was cooked just right in both dishes, and the sauces both tasted like they had been cooking all day.  Mine was Pici with Lamb and Spigarello.  I'm a big fan of bucatini, and the Pici was right up my alley.  I am NOT a fan of broccoli, but I loved the sauce even though I guess Spigarello is related to broccoli!  The lamb was tender and there was plenty of sauce to dip my bread into!  The duck ragu was similarly tasty and plentiful.  I think we just both wished the servings were bigger!  \n\nLastly, we shared the chocolate and almond milk budino that came with my prix fixe meal.  The chocolate was rich, but not too sweet, and the firmness of the chocolate layer was a perfect contrast to the almond milk on top.  It was also served with these great crispy cookies that we could put eat the budino with, and we destroyed our dessert pretty quickly.\n\nOverall, we had a great experience at Cotogna.  In addition to the great food, the service was just right for most of the meal -- attentive but not intrusive at all -- until we had trouble tracking down our server to get the check at the end of the meal.  However, that may have been preferable to being rushed out a restaurant at the end of the night.  We can't wait to go back, but next time we'll try to plan ahead so we don't have to eat right before bedtime!", "author": "Pilan C."}

My assessment after all these visits - where I've eaten there alone, with friends at the bar, at the community table or in designated table; as a walk in or with a reservation, or showing up an hour early hoping to get in sooner than later, I have to say that I have never left Cotogna disappointed.

The menu was varied and interesting, so we decided to go tasting menu style in order to try a bunch of things.  We ordered:\n\nfarm eggs, proscuitto, reggiano parmigiana fonduta, brussel sprouts\nfarm egg raviolo in brown butter\npotato gnocchi in duck ragu\nPizza with fried egg, guanciale, brussel sprouts\n\nEverything was delicious.  Gnocchi was very light.  Bread dipped in the left over parmigiana and brown butter after consuming the raviolo was sinful.  However, the first egg dish and the pizza were the real stand outs.  The egg dish was unusual with the melted parmigiana drizzled on top of the proscuitto, egg and brussel sprouts - very decadent, creamy and rich with a nice contrast from the roasted brussel sprouts.   The pizza crust, i dare say, is one of the best I've had in the city.  At least as good, if not better than, delfina pizzeria, ragazza, gialina.  I know, bold statement. It was ridiculously good.\n\nTo top it all off, the cocktails were excellent.  I want another one of those blood orange mimosas NOW.  Who knew vermouth could elevate a mimosa like that?\n\nI will caveat that I think our experience exceeded the typical brunch experience partly because of the tasting menu style.  Regardless though, the food was fantastic.  We are jonesing to go back.  i've been replaying the meal in my head all weekend.\n\nOne knock  - the ambiance and decor is very nice, but they really need to get the window shades installed.

Wines were excellent, though the waitress seemed befuddled by our requests for wine recommendations.  I'll go back.\n\nThe overall experience, however, was tainted by our arrival.  Our bad: we arrived without a reservation at 7PM on a Friday night.  We heard the hostess tell the party in front of us that they were booked until 10PM but that the bar had a 45 minute wait.  She also told them that she would seat them at the only two empty seats at the bar if that party didn't arrive soon.  \n\nWe put our names on the bar wait list and went to Bix for a drink.  We returned 45 minutes later and saw the party who was in front of us when we checked in finishing their meal, and there were two empty seats next to them.   This would seem to suggest that we would be seated soon, but when we checked in again we were told that there was another party ahead of us.  Funny, I said, because those women who look to be almost done checked in right ahead of us.  At this point we got a lengthy story about how one of them was having a birthday and Quince had lost their reservation and so Cotogna had to seat them right away.  Do I believe this?  Maybe, I don't know.  \n\nNot willing to venture outside again, we stepped behind the hostess stand to wait.  A few minutes later the hostess told us that a table (a REAL table) was available, but that we would need to be done in one hour.  Having a time limit imposed on a $50/person meal doesn't generally sit well with me.  She asked if we could finish in an hour, to which I replied, \"you tell me\".

Servings are small, so order appetizers and sides if you are on the hungry side. \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and you might share a table with another party or accidentally overhear someone else's conversation because of the tight quarters, but the food more than makes up for that.\n\nAppetizers: \n- Fritto misto: basically, fried asparagus, spring onion, and fava beans with aioli. This was a great start to get us ready for our meal. \n- Shaved spring vegetables with green almonds: fresh, but forgettable. \n- Yellowtail crudo: I loved the lime flavor with the fresh fish! Not the best cuts of fish, but this isn't a sushi restaurant. \n\nPastas:\n- gnocchi: served with dungeness crab, this was by far my favorite dish of the night. I'm usually not a huge fan of gnocchi, but this was cooked to perfection and the sauce was pure bliss. I would definitely get this again next time.\n- squid ink pasta with squid: not very flavorful, and pasta was too al dente for my liking.\n- ground lamb/duck pasta? I don't remember exactly what the third pasta was, but it too lacked flavor and texture.\n\nPizzas:\n- margherita: I'm not a huge fan of cheese but I felt like this was missing something...tomatoes perhaps?\n- ramps, panchetta, egg: my favorite part was the egg! The crust seemed too thin to support all the toppings, and was a tad flavorless. \n\nSides: \n- grilled asparagus: grilled to perfection! I wish you got more than 5 spears per order..\n-marinated beets: I usually don't enjoy the earthy taste of beets or the creamy consistency of cheese, but the burrata made this dish okay for me.\n\nEntrees:\n- spit roasted pork loin: delicious. This was cooked perfectly and so full of flavor.\n- rabbit leg: It was good, but I was too distracted with trying to eat it without resorting to using my hands. The meat was a bit chewy and it did not want to leave the bone. \n\nMisc:\n- asparagus soup: this was my least favorite. It was a bit bitter, and the texture was odd and not enjoyable.\n- ham with crunchy things: I forget what this was called, but the meat was really tender and enjoyable. I have no idea what it was served on the side with, but I love anything deep fried and crunchy.\n- foccacia bread: delicious! You have to request this, but it's really worth it. \n\nThere are a few items I'm forgetting (I remember crostini, but I forgot what it was paired with) and we were too full for dessert, but I feel like after tasting almost the entire menu, I can conclude that you have to go here at least once in your lifetime.

Hmmmm\n\nFortunately they also have a vegetarian option and a fish option each night. At least that's what they told us. Odd that we saw a bit of unannounced poultry heading out to certain diners as we ate.\n\nOur courses:\n- Roasted corn on the cob. It was tasty and very well flavored, but the actual corn (from some name-brand farm) was pretty anemic. I'd have passed it by on the shelf had I seen it at Whole Foods.\n- Minestrone soup: Super-delicious. Solid veggies & beans and a nice pesto on top. Generous portion. As good as a proper vegetable soup can be. \n- Pork Ribs: a wee bit dry. Well-seasoned. Great accompaniments.\n- Alternative Entree - Eggplant Parmesan-like thing: Very tasty\n- Alternative Entree - swordfish on Eggplant/bean compote: Fish was good - maybe a bit overdone. \n- Dessert: Roasted summer peaches with zabaglione on top.

While the food has been good, but not great,  the service has ranged from unprofessional to terrible. This last time put the icing on the cake. I will not be going back. \n\n1. Our bottle of wine (that we had order upon arrival) was not delivered to the table until well after our appetizers had been delivered. This is a big no-no. \n\n2. We were sat under a ventilation fan, and it was freezing.  I asked the server if there was anyway to turn off the AC. She said she would check in with the manager about it. Fast forward 20 min. Still freezing, still blowing air. The manager comes to me and says that he's turned off the AC, but that the fan will remain on. He says that if I'm still cold in a little bit he can turn on the heat, but the fan will still blow on our table. He did not offer to move us despite that it was not busy, a Monday night and there were multiple tables open. I waited until we finished our appetizers and we were still freezing. I told the server and she said she would get the manager. We waited another 5 min. at which point the manager still hadn't materialized. By then the table next to ours had left and I simply asked another server if it was possible to move to that table. She said yes and had a bus-boy clean it and move us over. Why was this not offered to us in the first place? It was very clear that we were freezing with our coats and scarves on through most of dinner. A good server or manager would have immediately tried to move us. \n\n3. Our server kept trying to clear our plates despite the fact that my guest was not finished eating. It's just rude and poor form to remove a plate when one person at the table is still eating.\n\n4. Overall, the three times I've been, service has been either inattentive to the customer and/or too attentive to flipping the table to get more guests in. I hate being pressured to eat faster than 1.5 hours for a 2-top. \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be returning to Cotogna, nor will I recommend it.", "author": "Ma\u00efa Cybelle C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-03", "description": "Does not stay true to Italian flavors. Beyond that, the food just didn't taste good. For a fuller explanation, read below. \n\nI don't get the hype and now I know why Anthony Bourdain is so critical of the \"James Beard Award\" designation. Perhaps the lofty expectations set my experience up for failure. I didn't hate the food but probably would never choose to go back (given how difficult it is to secure a decent reservation).\n\nStarted off with the fried squash blossoms and pesto pizza. \n* The squash blossoms were fried in an unusually heavy, chewy crust and tasted quite bland (far different than any other fried squash blossom I've had in the past). \n*The pizza came out on a plate, allowing the crust to get extremely soggy and was overloaded with tomato sauce and mozzarella -- which was fine if this was the same pizza described in the menu. Unfortunately, it wasn't. And who wants soggy crust? \n* The wild boar parpadelle was watery and bland. The pasta did not strike me as homemade either.  \n* Finally, I tried my wife's pork tenderloin. To their credit, the pork was cooked perfectly but the sauce was bland and the overall flavor was overpowered by the presence of piquillo peppers (whose presence in the dish did not make any sense to me). \n\nThe other big miss was a result of the service. I'm usually not one to complain about \"service\" but this experience was a headscratcher. After taking our orders and serving our wine and appetizers, the waitress returned 30 minutes later (right before serving our entrees) to inform us that the veal chop that my wife ordered was no longer available. I understand that restaurants run out of items all of the time but my problem was more a result of the fact that it took them 30 minutes to notify us. I also had a bigger issue with the fact that the manager simply apologized for the confusion and clearly repeated that the ONLY thing they could do was offer to get us something else. There was no proactive offer to comp the appetizers or bottle of wine. Not until I told her that we probably would never return did she look to correct the problem.\n\nWhile I will acknowledge that they eventually recognized their mistake by comping my wife's entire order, I argue that the comp should have been the offer at the beginning. \n\nBuyer beware. Stick to the other side of Market Street for Italian (Delfina, Flour and Water, La Ciccia, etc.). Don't waste the effort or money unless they clean up their act...", "author": "Kenneth K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-11-10", "description": "Ooooooh this one is a toughy.  I so so so wanted to like this place. I've been to Quince and was very happy to have done so.  When I heard about Cotogna, I was ready to fall in love.  Hmmm, sort of like when you meet a super good looking person who is polite and sort of fun but ...nnnngg....there's something missing.  Still a very good meal. Place is lovely and comfortable. Service is stellar. \n\nFirstly, I was being treated to a great restaurant for an anniversary of sobriety. That being said, they have this really great waiter-ing system where EVERY waiter is your waiter. However, that meant we were asked no less than 4x by 4 different waiters if we wanted wine or drinks when we'd already explained why we were there. Oh well, no biggy, just awkward after the 3rd and 4th time. \nAsked for bread, and so happy we did, since it's a soft focaccia wonderfully flavored with the thinnest amount of oil, and ample salt. Really nice.\n\nStarted off with the rabbit; it's served cold with liver inside and the flavors are beautiful. That turned out to be our favorite.\n\nTajarin  of chicken livers was nice, but the pasta was juuust undercooked enought to be bothersome. Another few seconds and still firm but al dente would've been reached. More chicken livers (less over-cooked pieces) and more gravy would have pulled it together.  (I've had Flour&Water's version which was eyes rolling in the back of your head good.)\n\nPapardelle with braised short ribs was delicious. Yet, as above, the same issue with the pasta and the amount of gravy. The short ribs, however, were manna from melty heaven. Yum.  Add more short ribs!\n\nNow, I heard absolute raves about the spit roasted pork loin, and i now have no idea why. The crust was the best part. The pickled cabbage was yummy, but the actual pork meat was positively bland. 3 small slices on a huge plate. I have no aversion to subtle but I was left pining for a salt shaker.  Luckily the bread was salted, so I sopped up the juice popped a piece in my mouth to give it a little extra oomph. \n\nFor a veggie, we ordered the rapini with chili.  The first few bites were as bland as bland could be, then WHAM! Salt!  ouch. Tongue assault. Not well mixed, eh.  p.s. it came late and we only had a few bites of meal left and ended up finishing the veggie solo. \n\nLastly, for dessert we chose the dark chocolate tart with pistachio gelato. The pistachio gelato was nice, a scoop resting on crumbled chocolate cookie crumbs.  The tart was simply a 2 inch dense piece of fudge.  Not what I was expecting at all.    \n\nConclusion, very nice ambiance and great service. Food was still yummy but not as yummy as it could be for me. Try it out for yourself, you might like it.", "author": "B B."}

The pluses - relatively easy street parking, good food, attentive service.  First off, the pizza was really good - thin crust, chewy and yet, light and crispy. You could taste a hint of smokiness from the wood fired oven.  My sister had the pasta with clams and I had the tagliatelle with duck bolognese.  When I picture bolognese, I picture meat, with a mix of carrot, celery, onion with a touch of tomato concentrate.  Sadly, there wasn't any of these elements.  The pasta as well, was a little too chewy for my taste.  I guess I like my pasta to melt in my mouth.  \n\nAmbiance wise, the tables were a little too close for my comfort.  I mean, if I have to move the table to get out, then you know the tables are too close.  Well, I guess they're just trying to pack in as any diners as they can... \n\nService wise - top notch and very attentive. \n\nAll in it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.

The spinach mouse was so light and flavorful. \n\nAfter the 1st course we went on to corn meal pasta with leeks and the Gorgonzola tortellino - only improving our impression of the menu. \n\nThen the main course rabbit on skewers of rosemary - the best rabbit I have ever had. Along with the rabbit we also had the roast pork with braised fennel such a toss up as to which I would choose the next time. Actually probably the next time I think I would try their duck. \n\nThe service was great even on opening night.

I asked for some of the foccacia bread to accompany the gnocchi cream sauce and once it arrived the asst waiter had already taken the gnocchi dish away to make room for the pizza. Our waitress noticed that it had been removed. About 5 minutes later she brought over a side dish of that yummy cream sauce for dipping the bread.

The food was amazing, the service was pretty good, and the ambiance/atmosphere was very warm, clean and inviting. \n\nAs for food, we ordered the ricotta with onion appetizer, the pizza with ramps and an egg, the steak, the gnocchi with crab and peas, the summer tortellini, and the lamb pasta. We had sides of asparagus, carrots, and eggplant. All of the food was great. The highlights were the ricotta and onion dip, the pizza, the gnocchi and the tortellini. The asparagus were pretty basic but cooked to perfection. \n\nMy one complaint is that reservations were hard to come by (had to call almost a week in advance) and they did forget to bring one of our side dishes until after we had already finished out entrees.\n\nI would highly recommend Cotogna.

I've been dying to try this place for over a month now but hate making reservations so far in advance. When we arrived just before the 30 minute mark the hostess suggested going over to Quince to grab a glass of wine while we wait. It was slightly comical as we had not planned to go to dinner and were dressed extremely casual especially for Quince. We had our glass and waited at Quince for a good 40 minutes. By this time our wait had been over an hour and we were getting slightly irritated perpetuated by our hunger. We asked the hostess at Quince to call over and they said that our seats were finally available. \n\nWe sat at the counter near the grill and pizza oven. It was entertaining to watch the action going on while we dined. We started with the warm ricotta and artichoke hearts with crostini. It was delicious and a great start to the meal, I would definitely come back on a rainy night to order this alone. We ordered the squid ink pasta and the gnocchi with crab as our mains. The squid ink pasta was delicious, nice chewy consistency with a proportionate amount of squid, the bit of heat from the chilies. The gnocchi was disappointing as there was very little crab, not much flavor and the gnocchi's seemed slightly undercooked. We also order a side of the honey roasted carrots and the sunchokes. Both were so tasty and I'm planning on trying to replicate the carrots soon. \n\nWe left Cotogna around 10:30 and the place was still packed...guess reservations are almost a requirement for this spot.", "author": "Kacey H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-08-07", "description": "A. Maz. Ing!  I've been scarred by too many underwhelming dining experiences at \"top rated\" restaurants in SF but Cotogna blew me away.  I am glad that my dining partners and I weren't afraid to go all out because every single dish was spectacular.  The restaurant is intimate and dimly lit.  Valet parking is available but I found street parking after circling around about 10 times.  It feels fancy but not pretentious and you can certainly get away with wearing casual clothing.  Now onto the food:\n\n1. Burrata with charred tomato - Delicious, can't go wrong\n\n2. Paine Farm squab with black rice & ember roasted beets - One of my favorite dishes of the night.  Crispy skin on the outside, juicy meat on the inside\n\n3. Summer squash with gremolata - Ordered this because we realized we didn't order any vegetables.  So good.\n\n4. Raviolo di ricotta with farm egg - DECADANT.  Another top favorite.  Even though it only comes with one ravioli, it is best to split this dish amongst 3-4 people.  It is THAT rich.\n\n5. Pasta with nettles - I don't remember the official name but this was good too\n\n6. Gnocchi with wild mushrooms, stridoli &parmigiano reggiano fonduta - We were told that they used freshly picked potatoes.  There was definitely a significant difference from all of the gnocchi I've previously had.   The potato flavor was very strong - delicious!  And I normally don't care for gnocchi\n\n7. Bigoli neri with octopus, red wine & mint - WEIRD but the 3rd top contender of the night.  I always try squid ink pasta when I see it on the menu but have never liked it.  This was the first time I liked it.  Something about the combination with mint made it work\n\n8. \"Agnolotti dal plin\" - When I saw this plate, it made me think of mini purses made of pasta stuffed with rich meat.  So.  Good.\n\n9. squash blossom fritto - TOP CONTENDER OF THE NIGHT.  Lightly fried squash blossoms filled with cheese.  I thought that it would be too rich but it was surprisingly very light.  What a shame a plate only came with 4 blossoms.  I could have easily eaten 20 by myself.\n\n10. porchetta della casa - 2nd TOP CONTENDER OF THE NIGHT.  Very thick cut of porchetta with crispy pork skin (like a high quality version of pork rinds)\n\n11. Snap peas with spicy tomato sauce - Ordered because we needed vegetables.  Simple but so good!\n\n12. Chocolate semifreddo with chocolate nut crumble - Our stomachs were going to explode at this point but this was delicious as well\n\nOverall:  They do an amazing job of bringing out the natural flavors of the fresh ingredients without masking it with too much sauce and spices.  The portions are small and it's not cheap.  I recommend coming in a small group and ordering everything so that you can try all of the dishes.  Definitely coming back.", "author": "Justine L."}

But we had a party of 5 so I got to sample a variety of dishes.  I will say that the brussel sprouts - which came in a medium sized FULL bowl (I was prepared to see 4 or 5 - not atypical these days - high price, TINY portions) - were PERFECTION.  I would go back and order them and eat them all in one sitting every other day.  They were al dente - absolutely tasty and slightly crispy on the bottom. Even if you don't like brussel sprouts, you will like these.\n\nThe white grape gazpacho with almonds was very well received by 3 of the people at my table, and the other 2 were not that impressed. It's tasty - i will give it that.  But you have to really like the GRAPE flavor to appreciate this dish.  I didn't.\n\nI had a roasted chicken dish, on a bed of . . . . Chard I was told.  The chard - while tasty - was a gray-green clump of MUSH.  I am so used to restaurants really getting vegies RIGHT these days that I was shocked to see something so completely lifeless and overcooked.  The taste was DELICIOUS once I got past the presentation - but I would never order it again.  The chicken - which had a mouthwatering description - was really kind of a bore!  not that flavorful really.\n\nThe service was GREAT but slow - AND the 2 people footing the bill are regulars there - at least 2-3 times weekly.

Their cocktails are also $10 - try the Cydonia Fizz - so light, airy and with just the right amount of sweetness without being too sweet.  \n\nDinner:  You can order your own thing, but you'll have the most enjoyable time if you share.  We started with the Asparagus soup with poached egg.  I'm pretty much a sucker for anything with poached egg, but have never tried it with soup and this soup did not disappoint.  My friends and I agreed that it was the highlight of the meal.  \n\nNext were our two Primis:  Farm Fresh Egg Raviolo in a brown butter sauce and a Tagliatelle with Rabbit.  The raviolo was just one big ravioli in butter sauce.  It was good, but I felt like I was about to have a heart attack just eating a third of it.  The tagliatelle was flavorful, but the pasta was a little too \"al-dente\" for my taste.\n\nThe Lamb Sausage-Nettles-Ricotta came next and this tied for my favorite dish of the night.  The ricotta provided just the right amount of texture to the pizza without competing with the other two toppings.  Absolutely wonderful.\n\nFinally, we had the lamb from the grill.  It was flavorful and I appreciated that there were 3 large pieces (easy to split among the 3 of us), but I've had better.\n\nThe service was nice and attentive, though sometimes I think there was too much of a lag between courses.  \n\nAll in all, a very nice experience for a \"school night\"!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I tried the garganelli with rabbit and the pappardelle with lamb and neither had the execution and \"delicateness\" (not sure how to explain it) of Quince pasta dishes. \n\nAlso, I thought both dishes had a stingy amount of meat for the price ($16 each), though the meat in each was certainly flavorful. But the rabbit had either pieces of fine bone or really crispy skin...sort of like the texture of soft-shell crab.

I've been looking, looking and looking on OpenTable to see if I could get a reservation and the only one I could ever get was Sunday tables which didn't suit me.  Out of nowhere I decided to call and it turns out I could only make reservations one month in advance and it happened that I was free that day and it was a Saturday night.  Since we were watching the Giants play that night (I know I'm awesome since I'm a G-Men fan) we opted for a late dinner and invited our friends to come along which they quickly accepted.\n\nSo the night came and when we were circling we realized it's a block away from Bubble Lounge which I used to like hanging out at (I'm old and bed time is at 12 so no more out late at night).  The restaurant for those of you who don't know is situated next to Quince since it is their sister restaurant.  It's a beautiful restaurant; wooden tables,casual yet intimate setting, cozy and comfortable, the kind of restaurant where you feel like you're a bit in New York.  The reason why I say this is it was still bustling at 11pm.  Anyway we all ordered some dishes to share and then our own entrees.  We ordered the soft shell crab to share and man was it delicious.  I usually only find it good at Japanese restaurants but this soft shell crab was large in quantity and came with a tasty aioli.  I didn't get to try the asparagus but they said it was tasty.  For entree, I ordered the duck bolognese pasta which was very good.  My gf ordered the uni pasta which was a bit spicy and too oily and didn't have enough uni taste but it was decent.  Both pasta were a bit on the small side.  For dessert we ordered the trio of sorbet.  It's been a while since I sorbet has intrigued my palate but the trio of tangerine, kumquat and cucumber was a perfect way of finishing a meal light after the pasta.\n\nService was good.  Again I ordered a cocktail that I didn't like and they were nice enough to give me something else.  \n\nIt was a bit on the pricey side, $120 for two people but that's probably because we had a few drinks.

We're patient people and we would have understood, but she did nothing to assuage what objectively was shaping up to be a bad fine dining experience. It was if she had resigned herself to double-down on overall sucking. When it came time for another drink and possibly dessert, we cut our losses and asked for the check. \n\nAll in all, the food was great and the service was atrocious. I almost felt discriminated. I don't know on what basis, but we certainly felt self-conscious based on the mannerisms and overall behavior of our server, Shaila. Ultimately, the food doesn't transcend such bad service. I can get both at other restaurants in Cotogna's wheelhouse.", "author": "Uncle M."}

Wood fire burning open air kitchen makes it unique and gives the place a comforting vibe.\n\nDecided to go here at a whim last night and got reservations for 6:15pm. Wanted to try their $24 prefix but got there and it was mozzerella salad as a starter, swordfish, and some crumble dessert. Bleh!\n\nSo being the picky food eater that we are, my GF and I got the rabbit papardelle, fire roasted pork, warm ricotta and mushroom crostini starter, rappini with peppercini, and ended with the chocolate torte. Both entrees were recommendations of fellow yelpers.\n\nThe GF had high hopes that her papardelle would be just as good as the one she had in Italy (NOT!) so we were already off to a bad start...\n\nDespite it being homemade pastas, for me it was just a bit lacking in something. it was tasty, and the pasta was fresh and al dente, but teh rabit ragu was just missing something. overall a good dish but not mind blowing. Small portions too.\n\nThe highly recommended roasted pork- from the reviews i had imagined it to be crunchy on the outside, juicy on the inside. What we got was a tasty slab of REALLY fatty pork that was heavily seasoned,almost too salty really.\n\nThe thin slices of pork was really so fatty that there was hardly any meat! I didnt pay $24 for a slab of roasted fat but that was what i got =(.\n\nIt was so salty that we had to get a side of something- the rapini which was also salty too...\n\nThe warm ricotta with mushrooms was tasty, but again nothing mind blowing.\n\nEnding with the chocolate torte dessert- ok, warm, gooey, chocolatey but it was only chosen since none of the other dessert items seemed to suit our fancy. \n\nA cute restaurant with decent food, but not worth the $48 per peron price we paid!\n\nonto the next!\n\nAmy", "author": "Petri Y."}

Service has been terrific up until this last time, when it was truly lacking.  We sat at the counter this evening, as usual.  Got the Sunday evening prix fix.  Each of the four courses (soup, pasta, beef w/salad) was superb.  But, I felt the waiter was oddly unfriendly.  I asked if I could substitute the dessert course for cheese.  He said yes but there were be a supplemental charge.  I sat there obviously listening to hear how much that would be and he never said and just stared back at me for a moment and walked away.  I also paired the courses with wine, which were skimpy pours at best.  If I were looking for volume, I would've been much better off getting three glasses of wine for the same price as the wine pairings ($30).  To make matters worse, he didn't bring my pairing for the last course.  I didn't think about it until about halfway through and then asked about it.  He quickly brought the pairing, poured a couple sips into the glass and ran away.  No apology or explanation for his tardiness.  For an $80 prix fix plus wine paring, I expect a higher level of service.  Then, the wine tasted bad.  I asked my partner taste it and he agreed there was an effervescence to the wine.  I brought this to the waiters' attention and he said \"that happens sometimes\" and walked away.  We all looked puzzled.  I had consumed about half the wine poured and obviously didn't like it.  He didn't offer to change it or anything.\n\nOne other thing bothered me about the service, which is this: I watched how our waiter interacted with the other group at the counter.  He was much more involved, poured much more generously and even gave an extra pour when the husband finished his wine before his course was finished.  Cotogna only serves the prix fix on Sunday evenings and the husband next to us obviously had the wine pairings because the waiter poured the same exact wines for both of us.  Normally, I wouldn't even take notice, but I did this evening because I felt the service was lacking from the get go.\n\nI will absolutely go back to Cotogna.  Everyone there has been wonderful but for this one waiter.  As we were walking back to our car, we all said that we'll definitely go back but that he will never wait on us again.  No reason to spoil a wonderful meal with inadequate service.\n\nBTW for Cotogna's reference: we were the 3-top who sat at the oven counter on the right end (i.e. near the hall to the kitchen).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-12", "description": "Came during opening week of Quince's less formal offshoot.  Italian fare focused on the northern part of the country.\n\nWe split everything family style to get a taste of as many dishes as possible.\n\nHits:\n- Raviolo pasta: one large ravioli with cheese a poached egg inside.  Buttery and delicious.  We had three orders (the dish is pretty small)\n- Tajarin w/ chicken liver: personally, not a fan of liver in general but in this dish, the flavor of the meat blended well with the amazing al dente pasta\n- Side of different colored carrots with honey and anise: Love the touch of sweetness.  The anise added a nice balance.\n- Panna cotta with persimmon and pomegranate - AMAZING dessert.\n\nMisses: \n- Pizza with squash, caramelized onions and chanterelle mushrooms: bland and overly sweet\n- Side of cauliflower gratin: also quite tasteless, especially in comparison to the other sides (carrots and pickled beets)\n- Chicory and raddichio salad with burrata and pomegranate: while the cheese was stringy and delicious, the greens were so overpoweringly bitter.  \n\nOthers:\n- Tagliettelle with bolognese: pretty good but felt like I've taste this dish in many restaurants\n- Spit-roast pork with fennel and orange: heavy fat around the edges, not as tender as I would have preferred.  The orange and fennel were nice touches though.\n- Polpettone (meatballs) with fingerling potatoes: yummy\n- Pickled beets with horseradish: tasty but not as interesting as the carrots\n- Bonet with amaretto crumble: similar in texture to the panna cotta but pales in comparison.\n\nAll bottles of wine are priced at $40 so that patrons are encouraged to select one by preference of grapes and description.  We had two bottles of the 2008 Querciabella Mongrana Maremma Toscana (recommended as this is the only wine on the menu that had Cabernet Sauvignon grapes).  Heavier wine but not too overpowering.  Typically priced between $16-20 so a markup of around 2X.\n\nAs you might expect with brand new restaurants, service was spotty at times.  After our server brought our first bottle of wine, he literally disappeared for 20 minutes and the hostess had to track down a different server to take our order.\n\nLater on, when they brought our second order of the raviolo, a server  knocked over a full wine glass into the pasta.  Understandable mortified, she was, however, very professional and brought us another order and refilled the glass to the max.  Very considerate and a major plus.\n\nAll in all, a good night.  And for all the food and wine we had, it came to about $80/pp with tax and tip.  Yes, not cheap but oddly, you still got relative bang for your buck.", "author": "F. P."}

I had the pumpkin hazelnut tortelloni and the mushroom crostini. My companion had some crab-something; the meal itself was pretty forgettable. \nEverything tasted garden fresh, the way ingredients were paired was innovative, and the plating was lovely. The dishes were laughably small. Two pieces of bread-- the length and breadth of two fingers-- with spread for $12? Esquire, I think you need to reevaluate what \"wallet friendly\" means to the avg Joe. My $16 handful of pasta was okay, but bland. I honestly wouldn't mind the price/ quantity ratio if the food were even mildly impressive, but it's not. \nThe drinks are tasty, but served in these tiny, delicate martini glasses that make me feel like a giant.

Thursday at 9:30 pm is a popular time slot at Cotogna; we were seated 25 minutes past our reservation. The hostesses were apologetic & gave us frequent table status updates, though. \n\nI go out for pizza about three times a year & even less often for pasta & other Italian eats. When a sudden & unexplainable craving hit, a few little birdies whispered 'Cotogna' into my ear (thank you for the recommendation, Miss Janice C!) Even the BFF had fallen victim to Cotogna mania. And so, the decision was set in stone. \n\nMy apologies, I am completely Italian menu illiterate, so I'm forgetting our dishes' printed names, but here's a rough description of our order:\n--ricotta, arugula, roasted figs & bread: perfect appetizer. I'm slowly starting to enjoy (some) cheeses & the very spreadable ricotta delighted me! Can't go wrong with starting the night off with figs!\n-- pizza with pork sausage & ghost peppers: spicy without setting my mouth on fire. I didn't eat the sausage crumbles, so I can't comment but BFF seemed to enjoy them. Thin crust was a little soggy but I liked the light sprinkling of quality toppings. A light entree, at least as far as pizzas go. \n-- snapper for the BFF \n-- panna cotta w/ honey, brittle & strawberries: out of this world! Sweet & tart. \n-- cherry frangipane pie: so good, it started a two day pie hunt! Again, tart cherries mixed with the sweet almond paste & crisp crust was a flavor explosion! \n-- I took their cookie sampler home: marzipan (chewy, sweet...made me wanna do a happy dance!), chocolate olive oil (yummy!), and a biscotti one that I didn't particularly care for. \n\nOur server was good about explaining the words I didn't recognize on the menu (I am SO embarrassing to go out with!) He was frazzled from the dinner rush but didn't push us out the door at closing time. \n\nThe ambiance at Cotogna is dark & romantic, but that doesn't mean you can't have a pow wow with your friends at the bar or at the communal table.

The bartender was very friendly and attentive, helping us make wine and dinner selections.  The cool thing about the wine list here is that all glasses are $10 and all bottles are $40, so you don't feel any price pressure.  We went with the Mongrana, which was delicious and went perfectly with our meal.\n\nThe food, on the other hand, was a bit hit-or-miss.  For appetizers, the Halibut Tartare was pleasant but somewhat underwhelming, while the Chicory salad with Pomegranate seeds and burrata was unique, refreshing, and definitely worth getting again.  For entrees we both got pastas--the papardelle of lamb and the rosemary gnocchi with braised duck.  The lamb was excellent, despite the small portion, and the gnocchi was decent but could have used some salt.  \n\nTo end the meal, we got the panna cotta and the b\u00f2net with caramel & amaretti crumble.

A coveted 12:45 lunch reservation for 2 thankfully meant an actual 2-top and not the communal table. (is anyone else tired of that trend, btw?)\nFirst glass of wine = totally corked. Smarmy dude at the neighboring table decides to give his 2 cents and say Barolo is supposed to smell weird. Thanks, my friend - we're actually in the wine industry and are very sensitive to TCA. But thanks for the input - it looked like your date really appreciated the intervention as well! Not.\nANYWAY.\nReplacement glasses of wine came pretty quickly - my friend had a Montepulciano and I went for an old favorite: Cortese from Gavi's Villa Sparina. Both delicious.\nI had heard great things about the sformato in any variation so we went right for the wild nettle version on the menu that day. A quivering little custard of the prettiest spring green showed up with a savory Grana Padano cream. It was so amazingly good we had to order some bread to sop up the remaining cream. The focaccia came out on a long board that had a well of olive oil down the middle, so the bottom of the bread got pretty soaked in oil. Our other app was the duck pate with peach mostarda. This was presented on a board with 4 thin slabs of pate campagne-style (a little rougher)  that were accompanied by 2 bias-cut toasts, some fresh-dressed greens with pickled onions, and a little jar of admittedly delicious peach mostarda. If you got everything in one bite, it was really good!\nNaturally, we had to follow up with 2 pasta dishes - the crab tagliolini and the egg raviolo. These took a bit of a while to come to the table, so we started in our glasses of Rose - a crisp Rose of Canaiolo that was quite tasty. All was forgiven when the long-awaited pastas eventually made it. The crab dish came first, which was a beautiful twirl of bright yellow tagliolini with chunks of Dungeness crab and a light lemon cream. I kept wondering how it was possible to make a pasta sauce that light yet also so rich! Talk about rich, the raviolo came next... one large raviolo is filled with a perfectly-cooked farm egg, drenched with brown butter, and gently dusted with Parmesan. We cut into that bad boy and the brightest orange yolk I've ever seen slowly oozed onto the plate, commingled with the rich butter sauce, and made it to my mouth in record time. Let me tell you, it's a little awkward to try to lick a plate in such a crowded restaurant!\nI really wish we'd had room for pizza because there was one on the menu that I really wanted to try (guanciale? given!) but we only had room for dessert. And given the somewhat... leisurely pace of the meal, I really had to get back to the office! So we shared the affogato, which is espresso poured over vanilla gelato. I've traditionally only had it in a glass, but the gelato (2 scoops) was served in a metal chalice of sorts with the espresso poured over, accompanied by 2 hazelnut biscotti. I don't normally like biscotti but these were good and not too crunchy (read: dried out). The creme fraiche panna cotta served at another table looked very good as well - served with fresh strawberries and a crispy honeycomb crumble - so I'll definitely have to come back to try that. Fuck, I've gotta come back at least once every two weeks just so I can try one of everything! Well-played, Tusk, well-played.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

When I called to confirm they gave no apology, and acted as if I was trying to weasel my way in.  Be sure to confirm your reservation.\n\nThe second and even more disappointing experience was this evening.  We made a reservation for their \"Sunday Supper\", which we had been to before, and was described to us as a more casual family dinner compared to other nights of the week.  I noted on my reservation, which was at 5:30 pm, that we will have one child in need of a high chair.  When they called to confirm on Friday I restated the need for a high chair and they assured me it would not be a problem.  I even asked if it is ok to bring a child.  I said we understand she is not welcome and are ok canceling.  Again assured it would not be a problem.  Sunday evening we arrive at 5:30 and they hostess tells us they are sorry they only have one high chair and it is being used by another family.  Both of us had reservation so I do not see why this problem was not anticipated, as we would have been happy to bring a clip on chair from home.  She says she can offer us a regular chair for our 1 year old daughter, sorry that will not work.  The manager came over and gave a very insincere apology, while mentioning they rarely have children in the restaurant.  We decided to leave since we were not interested in having a $55 tasting menu with a squirming child on our lap.\n\nI completely understand that nice restaurants are not big fans of little ones dining.  I do not want to subject other customers trying to have a nice dinner to my children.  But when you describe \"sunday suppers\" as a casual family dinner and assure me over the phone that my daughter is welcome, don't change your tune when we show up that evening.  \n\nCotogna was once my favorite restaurant in the city that I always recommended to people.  It is unfortunate that their customer service is so subpar.", "author": "Katie D."}

This menu wasn't my favorite, actually most items were things I rarely would have ordered. Beets with arugula, fris\u00e9e, burrata and croutons, super oily and lacked some salt or acid. Tortellini more looking like ravioli filled with blue cheese topped with walnuts and radicchio and some shaved pecorino was again super oily and super heavy. It was good blue cheese but way too much. Next was game  hen, sauce was nice chicken I never order, this hen was a bit over. Persimmon cake, spiced Creme roasted chestnuts for dessert was dry and tough. Looked good though but so the contrary when we stabbed into it. Best thing was the sour apple sorbet that came from nowhere because we didn't order it but luckily we got it somehow.

It is however the fault of poor management, their lack of training, and the absence of oversight.\n\nSCENARIO: We had and 11:30 reservation on Saturday. I thought I left  my home with plenty of time to get to Cotogna but I ran into complications in the form of \"Fan Appreciation Day\" at Giants Stadium. \n\n(I know, I should have cross referenced the time and location of my reservation with local sporting news and all of this could have been avoided.)\n\nAt any rate I ran into about 10,000 orange and black clad lunatics wearing enormous sunglasses and fuzzy panda hats. All of whom, swarmed and stumbled aimlessly across the Embarcadero from Giants Stadium to the Ferry Building. \n\nTraffic was moving at a crawl.\n\nTo be courteous I called to let Cotogna know that I would be a little late.\n\nA hospitable response could have sounded something like this...\n\n\"Oh! I'm so sorry to hear that. Don't worry. Your table will be here for you when you arrive. Thank you so much for calling.\"\n\nInstead, this was Cotogna's response.\n\n\"OK... but just so you know there's a 1:00 o'clock reservation booked after you guys. Thanks.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: \"Look, I don't care about your predicament. My job is stressful enough without your tardiness screwing up my schedule and it would really help me if you rush through your lunch and get out in time for me to seat my next party. Thanks.\"\n\nOkay! So we arrive. Late? Yes... sorry. \n\nSo, Cotogna is a small room tastefully decorated and surrounded with large windows. During the day, some of the tables are drenched in gorgeous sunlight. Those tables can also be, unfortunately, unbearably hot. I could have fried an egg on the table we were offered so I asked if we could be seated at a nearby table of the same size that was nicely shaded.\n\nA hospitable response could have been... \"Certainly.\"\n\nThis was Cotogna's response.\n\n\"Oh... No. I'm sorry. I have that table set for five people coming in at one o'clock and you just won't have time to dine and be up in time to accommodate them.\"\n\nTRANSLATION: \"You're late... AND you have the gall to ask for a another table? Really? Let me get this straight... You want me to go out of my way, walk over there, get that chair I have shoved up against the shady table, move it over to this table of the same size where the egg is frying so that you can be more comfortable? Oh no...you sit where I tell you to sit. I've got a plan and I'm sticking to it\"\n\nOkay! So... I'm looking around for a manager. No sign... small room... is she the manager? Dunno. Anyway she did offer us the \"Family table\" a nice long table near the wood oven and rotisserie that comfortably seats eight and was only half baked in sun so it was an improvement and we sat there. I also realized through my own cognizance that I would be freeing up a reservation table by sitting at the communal table and therefore wouldn't be hassled with the nagging one o'clock deadline Cotogna kept reminding us of.  \n\nNow, the family table seating is a couple of large heavy benches. My girlfriends mother was struggling to climb over one to sit down but it was pushed too close for her to get in. Our \"hostess\" stood there with the menus lamely watching her struggle until I snapped out of my anger fog and lugged the bench out myself. We sat, the menus went down our hostess pleasantly smiled and said, ironically... \"enjoy your lunch!\"\n\nLunch. Small plates to start and share... pickled Monterey sardines, buratta with Chicory greens, a typically cured salmon plate, and another dish witch I've forgotten. We finished with some small appropriately portioned \"entrees\" which were all well made with High quality ingredients but consistently under seasoned. No wine... fizzy water which they filter and fizz themselves. When I asked I was told sincerely that... \"Yes... we filter the water ourselves and it is done in such a way as to make the water neutral so that it doesn't interfere any of the flavors.\" I almost sprayed  filtered fizzy everywhere laughing.\n\nTRANSLATION: \"Here at Cotogna we focus on the minutia at the detriment of hospitality and service.\"\n\nLook, restaurants serve food and drink but they THRIVE on providing great hospitality. When a guest patronizes Cotogna or any other expensive restaurant, he or she is not only expecting good food and drink but also great hospitality and excellent customer service. If any of these elements are out of place, then the VALUE of their experience is nullified. By the way, we paid almost $200 for lunch and were out by one o'clock.", "author": "Bob A."}

Sure, there were some definite breakfast items like pancakes, egg dishes, etc..., but these seemed secondary to the actual lunch dishes. However, the staff and place are still amazing.

Open kitchen.  Dark ambiance.\nOrdered:  Prix fixe menu: trumpet mushroom and potato soup, grilled mackerel and radicchio with kumquat, pink lady apple tostada, grilled garlic & rosemary pork shank for two, and trio of sorbets (huckleberry, lemon, and vanilla gelato).\nTotal incl gratuity: ~$86.00\n\nCotogna landed on the 7x7 and instantly became a place the bff wanted to try.  We booked resos a week in advance and was only able to get 9pm on Saturday night.  It was a rainy Saturday night, not the most ideal conditions to be out for dinner but the unexpected savory dishes made up for it.  It was a late dinner so we were pretty hungry.  The prix fixe menu was on the 7x7 so we had to do it. The pork shank sounded TDF so we opted for both.  Our server said it might be a little too much food but we went for it anyway.  We figured we could always take to go if anything.  Little did we know that we'd devour everything by nights end.\n\nTo be honest, I wasn't all that impressed with the prix fixe. Soup was so-so.  The mackerel was definitely the best part of the three courses.  It was extremely soft... melt in your mouth soft.  The citrus kumquat grinds and bitter grilled radicchio helped balance out the distinct assertive flavor of the fish.  The pork for two came out after the fish.  The garlic rosemary aroma was absolutely incredible.  Heads were turning from the aroma as the server brought the dish to our table.  When we took our first bite..our eyes rolled to the back of our heads in awe of the entrancing goodness.  WOW.  If anything, this pork should have been on the 7x7 list!  It was succulent and briny, just the way I like it.  I think if it were socially acceptable, the bff would have licked the plate clean.  We (or shall I say he) did a pretty awesome job devouring the entree.  When our server returned, she was in utter disbelief.  \n\nOur meal was extremely savory so it was good that we ended our meal with a light apple crostada and a nice tart sorbet.  It really helps to cleanse the palate.  Prices here are very reasonable - averaging less than $30 an entree. Good service and delicious food.

Frankly I was expecting a lot more from the highly touted restaurant, sister to Quince. We were celebrating my daughter's birthday. We all enjoy good food and were ready to experience Cotogna. We started with 3 apps including Squash Blossoms, Green Tomatoes, and Roasted Figs with Ricotta. The Fig/Ricotta dish was superior. The Green Tomatoes and Squash dishes were good however I have had better at several other well known star restaurants. We moved to 3 pastas all were good however not at the level I was expecting from a Bauer reviewed restaurant. The Tortelloni was a winner. We moved to Pizza Mushroom which was very good. The ingredients used were outstanding. Since we were somewhat full we all decided to share on entree.  My daughter ordered the Sea Bass. Everyone agreed it was very good however not over the top...Service was professional and friendly. We all know the competition in SF is at a high level.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-01", "description": "Okay, two comments.  1.  Hell yes; and 2.  When can I go back?\n\nReally a 4.5 star review, but these folks get the round-up to five.  Color me impressed.  We came in tonight with a party of six, of which one person did her own thing and five of us did family-style, so we got to try as much as possible of what Cotogna had to offer.\n\nAppetizer-wise, we started out with three offerings.  I wasn't expecting much from the ricotta della casa, since I'm not wild about ricotta, but this blew me away.  The ricotto was warmed with hazelnuts and 490 honey, which gave the dish a subtle sweet flavor.  The top/torched layer had a slightly burned, flavorful depth and sweetness.  Then we got to the grilled squid with romaine lettuce, green farro, and almonds.  WHOA.  Just whoa.  This was another dish I went along with my party in terms of ordering.  I'm not usually that into squid.  This was so good that I want to see if I can sneak in by myself at 5:30 PM some day and order a la carte, if they continue to offer it (right now, it's on the daily specials menu).  And our final appetizer was the halibut crudo with bergamot, pear, and avocado.  I was most looking forward to this, but I was the least struck by it.  I still enjoyed it, but it had very mild/subtle flavors and felt less memorable/creative than the other appetizers.  (The person who decided to order a la carte got the spinach sformato, and she really liked it.)\n\nWe then did a round of pastas.  This was the highlight of the evening. I was truly impressed by the duck pappardelle - the pasta was so fresh and flavorful and well-complemented by the duck (NB: there could have been a bit more duck.)  The raviolo di ricotta with farm egg and brown butter was extremely good but very rich.  And the gnocchi with dungeness crab and meyer lemon -- again the dish I was most looking forward to in this round -- while good, did not impress me as much as the other two.  The gnocchi itself was well-made and the dungeness crab was sweet and flavorful, but somehow, the dish didn't seem to hold together.  (This is where I know I'm an aspiring foodie, but not quite a foodie yet.  Only foodies and would-be foodies would talk about a dish \"holding together.\"  But I think a real foodie would be able to explain why the dish wasn't quite \"holding together,\" and I can't.)\n\nWe concluded the savory portion of our meal with a round of pizza and sides.  None of us were blown away by the pizza puttanesca (with anchovies and olives), which is the main reason for the drop from five to 4.5 stars.  Multiple people at the table commented that the crust was a bit soggy, and the anchovies overpowered the dish.  The sides, on the other hand, were solid.  The brussel sprouts were crisp on the outside and rich with flavor.  The roasted sunchokes also did not disappoint.\n\nOf the desserts, I would most recommend the apple-quince crostata with rum raisin ice cream.  I'm not generally into sweet desserts, but I'd order this one again.  \n\nCocktail-wise, everyone seemed pleased. For gin lovers, I'd recommend the drink named \"London [something]\" that came with lime - a flavorful, citrusy drink with a slightly bitter aftertaste.  Two people also ordered wine, and the waitress made an excellent chianti recommendation that matched the \"fruit forward without strong tannins\" request.\n\nService was both warm and accurate.  This is what I'm looking for in a restaurant.  I can't wait to go back.", "author": "B L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-26", "description": "The opening of Cotogna, Quince's more casual off-shoot, has been much anticipated. As I stepped into the dimly-lit dining room, my eye was immediately drawn to the rotisserie and wood-burning oven. Although the wood tables, stone floors, and exposed brick add up to a lot of hard surfaces, the ovens offer warmth and soften the room. The tables were mostly empty when I arrived but had already been reserved (they offer 4 tables up for reservations and the rest are for walk-ins, plus a communal table). We managed to find two seats at the copper-topped bar for as the dining room filled up (impressive on a Monday night on a holiday week). \n\nAfter tasting most of the whites available on the prix-fixe wine list (all glasses $10, all bottles $40), my lovely date and I settled on the Prosecco. Although I would prefer a range of wines at different price points, there's something to be said for being able to order by the glass and pay the bottle price. \n\nFor dinner we started with the salt cod fritelle ($10) served with roasted beets, aioli, and strands of pickled shallots. I was surprised to find that the fried, breadcrumb-crusted fritters were filled with shredded salt cod that was not combined with mashed potatoes or any other binders. The shredded cod resembled crab in texture. For pasta, we went with the house-made garganelli with rabbit and chanterelles ($16). Garganelli are like small squares of pasta folded over rods to form tubes, a labor-intensive process. This dish would be a good entry level dish for those that are hesitant to eat rabbit, it was very approachable and not at all gamey. Unfortunately, the pizza with raw and cooked porcinis ($15) was a major miss. For a pizza coming from the minds behind Quince and out of a wood oven in SF (where you are practically tripping over good pizzas left and right), this pizza was puzzlingly bad. The crust was bland, blond, and puffy. It's hard to go wrong with melting cheese and wild mushrooms, but the toppings were bland too, in need of salt or an acidic element. Our bartender noticed that the pizza sat untouched after we had our first taste and removed it from our bill. \n\nThe Tierra Farm shelling beans with olio nuovo ($6) were also puzzling. As SF was in the midst of a record cold spell and the ovens burned warmly, the beans arrived cold! Cold, and a little too al dente for our tastes! I had so been looking forward to creamy, braised, soft, and comforting beans napped with copious amounts of olive oil so the cold somewhat crunchy beans were disappointing. That being said, they were well seasoned and the olio nuovo was delicious. \n\nThe redeeming dish of the night was definitely the spit roasted pork served with a wild fennel and celery root puree and oranges ($20). One rib and two large slices of pork were fully tender and flavorful, but the best part was the crunchy bark on the edges of the meat. The fennel was almost undetectable in the dish and we both felt that the satsumas called out on the menu were more likely oranges, albeit small oranges. \n\nAlthough our bartender took good care of us, it was clear that he did not know the details of the menu. Overall, the meal had some high highs (the pork) and some low lows (the pizza). When they handed us our leftovers, there must have been a mistake, as I ended up with our beans and two pieces of the mushroom pizza (that we said we didn't want boxed up) and no rabbit garganelli! We had almost an entire pizza that we didn't want, so I'm guessing that this was someone else's pizza. It seems like the kitchen and staff are still settling in and working out the kinks. It will be interesting to see how Cotogna fits in the scheme of other pedigreed casual off-shoots (SPQR, Barbacco, etc) around town.", "author": "Candice L."}

However, Cotogna is not one of them as it was mediocre.  There were five of us for lunch so we were able to try various dishes.  First, of all, the waitress had NO personality at all and couldn't really recommend anything as she said it depended on your taste.  Well, duh, but it would be nice to have an opinion.  So we ordered some appetizers to start; the pizza was delicious, the squid was ok, and the Ciccoli and Lardo was a little bland.  The service up to this point was good as they came and cleared everything away and gave fresh silverware.\n\nThe entrees were really small.  The Taglioni with crab was a joke.  There was hardly any crab, the pasta was really dry and overall it was really fishy tasting. One of my friends told the waitress it was not good and they did take it off the bill and asked if she wanted something else.  It took quite awhile between the appetizers and entrees to get our food so my friend declined.  I will give the potato gnocchi a little credit as it was tasty but not memorable.  My other friend got some fish that was deep fried and came with three sauces on another plate.  My friend didn't know they were for her fish as the waitress never told her what they were.\n\nAfter more then half an hour of finishing our entrees, our dirty plates sat on our table.  I finally had to ask the hostess if she could get someone to bus our table even though she and all the staff had walked past our table numerous times since we were right in front.  \n\nThe bonet and chocolate torta were pretty good but you can get decent desserts anywhere.  \n\nI will not be back to this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-01-19", "description": "This restaurant is deserving of 5 stars because of the prowess of its chefs, the principles of its management, and the execution by its servers.  What a mind-blowing experience!!!\n\nCotogna's pizzas feature the best crust in the city.  This is a serious achievement, considering the competition, which includes A16, Tommaso's, Zero Zero, Flour + Water, & others, all of which have, at various times, taken the top honor.  When a restaurant absolutely nails something as fundamental, but as temperamental, as pizza crust, you know the cooks know their stuff...\n\nBut enough about the pizza.  Cotogna is the smaller, younger, much sexier sibling to Quince, the now famous, top-rated Italian restaurant in San Francisco... and I'd venture to say Cotogna beats Quince in a pinch.  The owners of both restaurants, which are next-door neighbors and appear to share restrooms (and perhaps some corridors), definitely understand how to attract and keep clientele.  An example of this is manifest in the fact that both restaurants serve a pasta dish that is truly exceptional (the raviolo with egg and brown butter); the way I see it, if it can be done, and if everybody would be appreciative if it were done, it should be done... hence, Cotogna serves a dish for which Quince has gained the highest esteem.  Too many restaurateurs believe that such a decision might diminish one brand; I think it was a deft touch to include the raviolo on both menus.  It shows that the owners care more about the satisfaction of their guests than about theoretical concepts of marketing.  Well done!\n\nService at Cotogna is exceptional.  My dinner companion is a long-time food professional, currently operating events for several high-profile museums in San Francisco.  We have been friends for a decade, and having not seen each other in ages, we were eager to catch up, explore the menu together, and engage with our server on our own terms; we made this quite evident, and the server obliged, not only with her sweet and sincere approach, but also by allowing us the time and space to order according to our own taste, and at our own pace.  Had the restaurant been empty, this might have seemed commonplace, but in a hotspot that was recently awarded 3.5 stars by Michael Bauer, in a hotspot that had NO OTHER seats open at any point during our dinner, I felt as though my patronage was not only appreciated, but actually highly valued...", "author": "Tudor J."}

The restaurant has a great atmosphere and general vibe.  We were seated at the table closest to the door and it was very nice.    The biggest problem I had with the Cotogna was the menu.  It's a very odd order of things and you aren't sure what is appetizer, main course, salad, etc.  We had to ask our waitress to go through every single item we were considering because most of the food descriptions are in Italian ( which doesn't really help us make a food choice since we couldn't understand the menu and it was very loud to hear the waitress try to give us a description of each and every item).  A description in English below would be immensely helpful.   As it was, what we ordered and what the waitress described were 2 very different things.   We ordered a farro arugula appetizer and while it was good, there wasn't a bit of arugula in the dish.  We also had the fresh mozzarella appetizer and it was not good......more like a plate of yogurt.   I had gnocchi and it was ok........ and we had 2 orders of bread which was outstanding.  Portions of everything are very small.   The other issue was the entire wine list is from Italy........they did offer to go to the restaurant next-door and get us a good Napa Valley Cabernet, but it took 25 minutes for her to bring a $125 bottle back.   Unfortunately, the whole evening felt very disjointed.  I might go back for a glass of wine and bread but that's about it.", "author": "Melonie S."}

If you want a table, make sure to make reservations - we walked in at around 8 and were told that we would need to wait until 10:30 for a table. However, I highly recommend that you sit at the bar as you are able to see the chefs at work and it is amazing.  \n\nWe ordered:\nWarm ricotta with fava beans & red onions.  \nThis was really good.  The onions are caramelized in skillet placed in an brick oven, and this brings out a unique flavor.  It is served with sliced toasted bread, and they go very well together\n\nTagliolini with dungeness crab & lemon\nThis was very average.  Bland flavor, only 2 or 3 pieces of crab.  Really nothing special to it - I would recommend that you pass on this one.  \n\nSpit roasted pork loin with wild fennel\nThis is some of the best pork I ever had.  The portion is small - don't expect Nopa sized portions.  However, there is an excellent balance between the texture and saltiness of the prok, the spiciness of the fennel, and the sweetness of the onion.\n\nPizza with ramps, guanciale, egg & pecorino Romano\nTHIS was the highlight of the meal.  We were able to watch this being made sitting at the bar, and it is amazing.  The cook described the ramps as \"bacon x10\", which is appropriate.  The pizza crust is thin, light, fluffy and has great texture, the mozzarella cheese is not heavy at all but has great flavor.  This is probably one of the top 3 pizzas in the city\n\nArborio rice pudding with pistachio & dried cherry\nVery disappointing.  Pudding was very salty.  There's just a few pistachios and cherry raisins sprinkled on top.  Pass on this one\n\nAmbience is very lively and casual - which is good.  Service was friendly and good.", "author": "Terry K."}

We ordered tons and tons and tons of food, which I've had a hard time doing since giving up meat, and I enjoyed every bite. For the meat eaters there is a entire section devoted to the grill but for those of you who would like something lighter, there are plenty of options.\n\nThe staff was lovely and attentive and Collette filled wine glasses frequently (but remembered that I was a designated driver).

For food, my friends and I shared the roasted carrots - amazing!  It tasted like Chinese braised beef, probably because of the anise in it.  I got the spring onion and asparagus pizza.

We asked for a second bottle of wine when our entrees arrived, but the wine didn't appear until they were clearing our dishes. oops. \n\nTerrific wine list with many Italian wines to educate your palate. \n\nNo one mentioned parking so when we walked back to the valet station at Quince next door, \"oh, go back and pay in the restaurant\". Back to the restaurant and no one at the host station and a couple waiting for some attention. Five minutes and $12 later I got my valet ticket punched.

But it's only when you actually taste food like this that you fully realize the difference between an average restaurant and an excellent one.\n\nEverything was delicious. After cocktails (Cydonia Fizz and Hudson), we started with yellowtail crudo with espelette pepper & lime. I'm not sure I've ever had sashimi in a Japanese restaurant that would top this. Next was suckling pig terrine served with citrus salad - we later decided this was the best dish of the night. For our pasta course we had gnocchi with dungeness crab & peas, and then farm egg raviolo with brown butter. Both very, very good, although the raviolo does swim in the brown butter, and was probably the least interesting dish we had. For our main course we split a spit-roasted pork loin with wild fennel - perfectly cooked, and well-matched to both her glass of Barbera d'Alba Boroli 2007 and my Mongrana Querciabella 2008. We were pretty full at this point, but there was no way we were going to pass on desserts such as Pink Lady apple crostata and a Napoleon of dates, walnuts & mandarins. Do NOT skip dessert at Cotogna!\n\nI'm tempted to give Cotogna 5 stars, but I did feel that the tables were a bit small and crowded together, the music ill-suited to the food, and the noise level a bit higher than acceptable.

We arrived 10 minutes early for our 7:15 reservation. We were encouraged to walk down the block to Quince's bar to wait. We had an enjoyable cocktail there but wait we did. We were not summoned back to Cotogna until 7:35 (20 minutes after our reservation) without any apology or thanks for waiting. The food was beautifully plated and presented and the fried squash blossom was greaseless but lukewarm and the cheese filling was no revelation. On the pasta front, the suckling pig cappellacci (a house-made sombrero-shaped filled pasta) were tasty but there were only 4 in the $17 serving. The pieces of crusty chili flakes were not palatable and did not add much value. They could be removed before serving. My companion's flounder with squid (actually baby octopus) over fregola was totally uninteresting and the ingredients seemed haphazardly flung together and did not bond in any kind of meaningful way. The romano beans that the server recommended were nothing special and the tomato sauce seemed like an afterthought. The nice thing was the servers did not seem to rush us at all - we were able to enjoy a leisurely conversational meal. However, it would have been nice had they come to check to see if everything was to our liking. I am glad I had the Cotogna experience but I am in no rush to come back.

I honestly don't see what all the hype is about. \n\nWe had the burrata with beets which honestly needed more salt and pepper. Plus they serve it with 2 tiny pieces of toast. How in the world is someone supposed to eat a lump of cheese the size of a baseball with only 2 measley pieces of toast? We tried it with their foccacia (which is only brought on request) but it was not a good combo. In fact, the foccacia did not taste good at all to be honest. \n\nNext we split the bolognese pasta. This was very good - not too big a serving, not too much sauce, pasta cooked just right. Lovely. But alone it's not running back for. \n\nFor a third course I had the broccoli pizza. The sauce was nice with a slight bite, the cheese rich and the crust smokey. It was all in all a fine pizza especially by SF standards (read: low bar). That said, I would brave Gialina or Pizzeria Delfina first before coming back here just for the pizza. My dinner companion had the snapper. It looked fine if not a little skimpy. \n\nDessert was the ricotta beignets. Very tasty. I'm not sure about the kumquats though. Limoncello sauce was lovely. Again, not worth trekking back for. \n\nService was really spotty. Our waitress was either very attentive on something or completely absent minded about others (our drink order... requests for water... bread... etc.). That was disappointing. \n\nIt can also be mind numbingly LOUD in there which is only made worse by the music in the background. \n\nQuite a raging cougar scene going on at the bar though so if you are into that you should check it out. \n\nAll in all: I'd go back if someone else picked it and was picking up the tab (work, etc.) but not my choice as a go to.", "author": "AceGirl .."}

Great ambiance, top quality food, reasonable prices, attentive service. For my first (and only) visit  I chose the three course menu (24$). An excellent  halibut tartare inaugurated the meal: the gently marinated and knife chopped raw fish was truly melting in the mouth, the accompanying flat bread was crunchy and delicious.  Housemade spinach pappardelle with wood roasted lamb were another culinary jewel: perfectly al dente egg pasta, extremely tender meat and a final touch of parmigiano cheese.  The bonet (or actually \"bunet\", as it is called in Turin) showed an example of well executed pudding, but the taste of chocolate+amaretto was a bit too weak if compared to a traditional Italian version, which, by the way, is probably my favourite dessert.  This little imperfection doesn't prevent me to give a full score, also considering the extremely favourable ratio quality/price and the perfect service. Moreover, my dinner was light fast: I walked-in (alone) on a busy Saturday night at 8.30PM, get a seat at the bar immediately,  get all courses in less than an hour, despite the crowd. \nOh yes, a really great spot!", "author": "Andrea L."}

Which at Cotogna was great and I'll describe later. Service and ambience are less important but in this case it did affect our dining experience.\n\nLike Kurt F below, we sat right next to the door and were cold all night. To me this was inexcusable. We called and made reservations a few weeks in advance assuming that it would be hard to get a table over the holidays (which judging by the crowd was a good call). Every couple of minutes I had to get up and close the door. Supposedly they had a heater but was broken. They should have put a little more thought into this oversight, i.e. should have put a two seater next to the door for walk-ins, have a couple of heaters on hand, put up some sort of barrier to block the cold air...etc.\n\nOk, enough complaining, let's get on with the food. \n\nApps: \n- Halibut tartare w/ blood orange and crisp flatbread: Very fresh fish, wish it had a bit more citrus (blood orange) to balance it out. if you like crudo or sashimi, good choice.\n- Annabelle's chicories w/ pomegranates and burrata: really nice fresh salad. The burrata was well made.\n\nSides:\n- Ember roasted onions w/ fonduta&hazlenut: one of the big hits of the night. This went well w/ the roasted lamb and veal stew we ordered.\n- Cauliflower gratin: good, but pretty basic. Nice crust on top. A bit too rich for us along w/ the fonduta. \n\nMain courses:\n- Lamb pappardelle: looks can be deceiving. Looks like a small amount but definitely satisfying. A nice hearty winter pasta dish.\n- Roasted leg of lamb w/ potatoes: does not come out on the bone but in slices, slightly disappointed in that :) It was tasty though. If you're not a lamb lover, would not recommend as the leg meat tends to be a bit rich/gamey.\n- Roasted chicken and potatoes: this was a special and I do not have the exact description but it was the best dish of the night. Chicken breast may not seem like a sexy dish but when it's made well (too many places overcook it), that's a good sign.  nice crust from the grill and the black cabbage underneath was a nice touch.\n- Braised veal stew: also a special and I do not have the exact description. Great winter dish. Tons of flavor, veal was cooked just right. The sauce really coated the meat and with the onion side dish was a great bite.\n\nWe'll be going back sometime to try the other dishes (the pizzas and the roasted pork looked amazing). Hopefully we'll be able to sit in a better spot.", "author": "Eugene P."}

Cotogna is a beautiful and rustic restaurant where you can opt to sit at your individual table, a communal table, at the bar, or in front of the wood oven where the chefs prepare the evening's food. Cotogna is located in one of my favorite spots in SF, Jackson Square. The service here is excellent and spot on. During my first visit, we ordered a couple appetizers, pastas and pizza which were frankly not memorable. During my second visit, I came with a girlfriend on a Sunday where the restaurant offers a $50 prix fixe menu. We also were recommended great bottle of Montepulciano for $40 (all the bottles are $40). The theme of the menu was pork and fruit/veggies featured from Frog Hallow and Knoll Farm. All items were so delicious, hearty, and innovative. First course, we had wood fired chicken liver and chicken liver mousse on a toasted slice of bread. The dish featured Frog Hallow Farm aprium (a hybrid of an apricot and a plum?) The pairing was brilliant! I never imagined I would enjoy chicken liver but this stuff was good! Next up we had smoked trout gnocchi.  It had sorrel and horseradish leaves in it. So so tasty and delicious. One of the best gnocchi I've had.  For our main, we had spit roasted heritage pork.  I am not a fan of pork tenderloin but I am now a true believer. Maybe I have been eating subpar prepared tenderloin. This dish also came with sausage and a nice fatty slice of pork belly. Sides were green garlic, fava beans, pea shoots, and carrots. One of the chefs slid my friend an extra cut of pork belly! Seconds? Yes, please! For dessert, we had cherry clafoutis (french country pancake/pudding dessert) with lemon verbena ice cream.  I loved how the dessert blended with the theme of the menu and the rustic ambiance of the restaurant. Towards the end of the meal, the farmer from Frog Hollow gave us a box of free rainier cherries. I will be back here for the Sunday prix fix as well as the service and charm of the restaurant. Love this place!", "author": "Annie Y."}

Given that it was quite cold outside, and very drafty and cold each time the door would open we immediately asked for another table. We were told that was all there was. We were freezing from the start! In my mind, that was absolutely inexcusable. \n\nThat table should never have been a table reserved days or weeks ahead, unless there was a space heater or a curtain separating the door from the tables. Had the restaurant kept that table and offered it to walk-ins to accept or not, that would have been one thing, but to give it to diners who planned ahead only to be freezing- what a shame! If I had been alone with my husband, we would have walked out; we probably should have, but I tried not to make too much of a scene.\n\nThe manager apologized; I'd expect no less, however he knew full well that we might be  (would most likely be) very uncomfortable. Oh, he offered me hot tea, as if I'd normally drink hot tea with my dinner. The manager did pay for 2 of our drinks- but I didn't want compensation, I wanted a comfortable and pleasant dining experience.

Heard about Chef Tusk and Quince which is right next door. Fine dining there and business casual here.  We ended up sitting at the bar since we had no reservations. Great ambience albeit a bit loud. Limited menu. Ordered a wood fired pizza. It was okay but not great. Surrounding crust was good but limp and soggy in the middle. Servers are not attentive and conversant. I tried to chat it up but couldn't get a decent conversation with anyone of the servers. Disappointing since my wife and I have been in customer service for years and we love the interaction. Will come back next visit and give it another try.", "author": "Adam W."}

Maybe not the best show out there, but my partner kept it in mind when I mentioned that I really wanted to see them and got us tickets.  After the show, we were trying to decide on where to have dinner later on.  A few places were discussed but when my partner suggested Cotogna, all the other places paled in comparison.  You see, I have wanted to eat here since they opened but had not been able to book a table for the times that we wanted.  So, this time, we just thought we'd walk by and see if we'd get lucky, assuming they're even open on Sundays.  As we were approaching, we saw the fire in the oven from their glass door and knew they're in business!   When we got to the door, the host unlocked the door and told us they were just opening and welcomed us to their first Sunday Supper!  Who knew?!  The menu is a prix fixed 4-course meal, starting with flat bread sandwich with prosciutto, minestra soup with a shrimp ball, porchetta with roasted peaches and haricot verts and finally, a strawberry dessert described to us as the Italian version of English trifle.  Of the 4 dishes, hands down my favorite was the main course, the pork roast.  It had the most delectably crispy skin with such moist, full flavored meat!!  But since it was the 3rd course, I was getting full and was not able to partake as much as I wanted to.  My 2nd favorite dish was the dessert, a creamy, boozy cake that was almost gone before I knew it!  My partner had to talk me out of finishing it for my own good, and I was grateful...  The first 2 courses were fine, but somewhat bland.  In particular, the soup, a puree, was as neutral tasting as it looked.  We both thought that a salad would have been a better option.  But, hey, I can't really complain.  It was just a great Sunday!", "author": "Yvette F."}

Every dish was over-salted.\n\nMaybe we just ordered the wrong things or perhaps caught them on an \"off\" night. \nThe meal for four including tax and 4% SF healthy tax (??)  came out to $100pp - at those prices you would expect the food to be flawless.  I can say out of the 10 various dishes we shared, only two of the pasta dishes were any good.  \n\nBread - upon request and very very oily.  served cold btw.\nRib Eye steak - 70% was inedible because of fat. The three or four bites of meat that were edible were very tasty though.  At $34, that's about $8-$10/bite.  \nRaviolo - served in a pool of burnt butter which is all you really taste.  A single raviolo about 2\" diameter.  not recommended.\nGnocchi - actually one of the dishes i liked.  we shared four ways which came out to about 3-4 gnocchi each.\nTortelloni - also good.  perhaps pasta is the way to go here. again, maybe 3-4 pcs pp.\nTuna - a bit dry and unimpressive\nRadicchio salad - unimpressive and the very large glob of ricotta on top did little to enhance the bed of greens.  \nBrussel sprouts - Extremely salty.  I happened to like the smoky burnt taste but perhaps not for everyone.\nCornish Hen - I was told good but salty.\nRapini - So unimpressive I don't even recall eating it.\nWarm espresso over vanilla gelato - exactly as described.  i was expecting perhaps a liquor as a secret ingredient but nope, just a small thimble of espresso that they dump right over the gelato at the table.  We left most of it uneaten.\n\nAlso, the staff was quite rude.  About 5 minutes after we were seated and before we had even ordered our drinks, we were told that they were expecting a party of 8 in less than 2 hours that would be needing our seats.    I think my mouth must have dropped open.  this may have been their subtle way of reprimanding us since because of a mix up, we showed up about 20 minutes late.  If I was not with clients and if we had not waited 2 months for the reservation, i would have just got up and left.", "author": "Jayel L."}

I personally would have given this place an overall 5 stars, but I'm writing SF reviews on behalf of family consensus, which when put to a vote was a 4. We all agreed the beverage menu was all star. Broad choices in the Wines by the glass category- everyone found a favorite. The barata app was a family favorite, along with the leak soup. My brother in law felt the bolognese needed more meat and tomatoes. It wasn't as hearty as he was use to eating. We came to consensus on the lamb pasta dish. It was excellent. Mixed reviews on the pizza. No one, except me, liked the black truffle mushrooms on the mushroom pizza. They were woodsy. I like woodsy. When pushed everyone agreed that they liked the pizza crust, just not the choice of topping that we had ordered. One of my favorite restaurants in SF.", "author": "Kari J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-30", "description": "I hate to give Cotogna 3 stars.....but I'm not really sure if they deserve more. It's overpriced (understatement) for what you get. I, like a few others, was completely underwhelmed by the majority of the meal. I suppose I was expecting more? We went for lunch on a Friday, as there were no dinner reservations to be had for at least another week out. The focaccia is good, kind of wanted more but I didn't want to fill up on bread. We ordered the gnocchetti and egg ravioli with brown butter sauce to start. To be completely honest the gnocchetti tasted like chef boyardee - straight from the can - not a good thing. It began to taste slightly better as I stirred it around, but overall this dish gets a negative 5. The ravioli is one giant ravioli, with a poached egg and ricotta inside. Flavor wise, this was the best dish, but I did want more bread as the overall consistency is very gooey. Nice balance of savory and sweet. Then we both got the cod. This was bland and over cooked. Bummer. The cranberry beans that accompanied the fish tasted great, but really, am I paying $30 for a dish of cranberry beans? The wine definitely helped me wash it down. \nSpeaking of wine - the sommelier is amazing! The wine I had ordered was out of stock, and she came over with other choices from the same region and helped us feel confident picking another choice that wasn't initially on our minds. Thank you! Also, $10 a glass and $40 per bottle set pricing doesn't hurt.\nThen dessert....I had the lavender infused chocolate tart with caramel. I would definitely get this again. Keep in mind, this is a very small portion, so if you want to try dessert but think it will be overwhelming, this is like the size of a truffle. Rich chocolate with just the right amount of lavender shining through. \nOverall, I wish we had maybe ordered less because most of the dishes were bland...sad to say. If the fish hadn't been overcooked, I could've said it was just a delicate dish with mild seasoning....but it just tasted rubbery and almost like I wanted to spit out any bites that didn't have a bean already on the fork. So I think I have to say, if you go, choose your dishes sparingly because you might be faced with consuming more bland food than you're really up to.....for the price, I mean....", "author": "Beluga W."}

Was looking forward to the menu--spit-roasted duck, tortellini di Castelmagno, brussel sprouts & apple tart dessert. Duck was overcooked with little flavor. Brussel sprouts were burned & unimaginative. Tortelloni di Castelmagno were flavorful & authentic, but the quantity (5 or 6) was ridiculously small. Apple tart was ok but nothing special. Had seen lots of diners at this place in the past, had read the restaurant's website touting its celebrity chefs & had read glowing reviews on Yelp. Thought I couldn't go wrong but, unfortunately, I was mistaken. Not only was the food unimaginative, but it also was poorly prepared & unauthentic, except for the tortellini. The atmosphere didn't appeal to me either. Noise level was very loud & was amplified by the restaurant's small size & poor acoustics (brick walls). Crowd seemed to be predominantly business groups & tourists. Very unromantic & unsuitable for couples & families looking for a calm, quiet dining experience. On the other hand, if rowdy, heavy-drinking diners are your thing, you probably would like this place. Bottom line--worst $124 (2 dinners, not including tip) I have ever spent. My advice--for Italian food in SF, steer clear of Cotogna & instead go to Palio d'Asti, 640 Sacramento St, SF, where each dish is prepared imaginatively, flavorfully & carefully. Another much better choice for Italian food--Lillian's in Santa Cruz.", "author": "David S."}

And it was definitely a nice surprise.  The photos on Yelp don't really do the place justice, but it has a lovely ambiance.  What I really wasn't expecting, was the place to be fully booked on a Thursday night (geez!).  But luckily for us, we were there early enough to grab two seats at the bar.  We started the meal with the Halibut Tartare with blood oranges.  This is really a must try.  Not because it is the most amazing dish ever, but because it is a delightfully surprising dish.  It has is a very subtle and unique flavor combination.  We then continued dinner with the nettles, lamb sausage, and ricotta Pizza and the Gnocchi and duck ragu.  The pizza has this wonderful thin and chewy crust.  It really is one of the better thin crusts that I've had.  The gnocchi was delicate and melts in your mouth.  We also ordered two cocktails: the Hudson and the Valentino.  The Hudson is nothing like an Old Fashion, even though it sounds like it. LOL.. be warned, it's a good, but strong drink. The Valentino was deliciously light and lovely.  A great \"girly\" drink that isn't too weak.", "author": "Joanne K."}

Once being seated ordered pizza, ravioli and porchetta. The pizza came out before our drinks and had to ask twice for bread. The table next to us was getting their food twice as fast as us as we overheard them say they use to work there. I ordered a bottle of Sangiovese to go with our main course, the food and wine came at the same time. After two sips of wine,I realized I had two deep cuts in my lip from a glass that is chipped in 2 place needless to say dinner now is over without starting. Upon notifying the staff of what had happened I was told that they had looked at the glass and did not see anything wrong with it I guess ignoring the blood that was on it but not to worry it was destroyed.  I asked for the bill only to find there are no deductions   All that was provided was some extra napkins and gauze. We paid in full told the manager are frustration of what happened and he tried to give e 100 cash back. Ruining a family dinner is beyond monetary resolve.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-09-23", "description": "I was quite excited this morning when I was told by my partner that Cotogna, a highly touted restaurant three blocks from our apartment on Telegraph Hill, offered \"sack lunches.\"   I had been used to buying a sack lunch about once a week from the former inhabitants of this location...Myth Cafe.  Their chef, Ryan Scott...infamously bounced from the Top Chef reality show for not knowing how to prepare picatta... rarely dissappointed  me with his daily offerings.   One complaint  of chef Scott would have been his overuse of black olives...when a few capers could have worked better...and would have taken him at least part of the way in the picatta challenge.    With Myth Cafe being my benchmark, I walked into a very nice looking dining room and was greeted by two extremely friendly staff members.   I was told that today's sack lunch was a fried chicken sandwich with side salad and a cookie.   I love chicken...and really enjoy fried chicken.   I took the meal home...unwrapped the sandwich....took a bite...and began to chew.....and chew....and chew.    On that first bite I encounted fat and gristle with a hint of chicken meat.    I removed that first bite from my mouth...placing it on a napkin.    I was hoping that I had just hit a bad patch...and that moving forward things would improve.    Unfortunately the patch proved to be what the great plains are to the American continent....more vast and more of the same.    When I did find a portion that I could chew and swallow.... I was underwhelmed.    The chicken meat was rubbery with little flavor....the coating was beige with no flavor....and the mayonnaise-like spread did little to enhance the flavor profile.   I took the liberty of removing the shredded cabbage from the ensemble.....it appeared off-pink and runny...not wanting to provoke my brass section later in the day.   The high point of the sandwich was the sliced bun.   It was medium brown in color...with an unoffensive flavor that was being sabotaged by the rest of the ingredients.    Halfway through the sandwich I opened the salad container.  What I encountered was a pasta and  greens combination.   It was pleasant enough visually, but as I inhaled, I experienced no aroma yet I dug in.   The spiral pasta was perfectly cooked....the greens were perfectly sauteed....yet it was missing a note that could have produced a tasty salad.  I prodded both ingredients with my fork hoping to get them to sing...what I got was one verse from William Hung's last holiday album.    On the other hand....the desert cookie was not bad.    I was quite dissappointed with my lunch experience.    There are some who would say \"Well...if you visit a major museum in Italy and only go to view the postcards in the gift shop...you will have missed the experience.\"    I would counter by saying Da Vinci did not produce the postcards....unlike Cotogna's chef who IS responsible for everything that leaves his kitchen, including the sack lunch.   This experience made me long for the return of the Myth Cafe whose offering was about half the price of the twelve dollars I was charged for the chicken.   I WILL give Cotogna another chance as I have heard nothing but great things about this restaurant, but not on fried chicken Friday.  \n\nMark W.", "author": "Mark W."}

I couldn't tell between starters and main coarses due to all the heading in Italian. If they are going to do that, they should put the translation in parentheses or something. It made it too confusing to navigate the menu. 2) The Service: it was a busy night granted, but servers need to learn to not act SO rushed in front of guests. While I was asking questions about what dish does what, my server acted flustered and all over the place probably trying to get to another table. Servers should learn to move Efficiently..not HELTER SKELTER. There is a difference, I used to wait tables trust me..I GET IT.  So that area I think needs a bit of polishing up. 3) The Food: Started with the wild mushroom and ricotta with crostini. Was a very good starter and no complaints here. Main Course. I had the Spit roasted pork which was delicious. It was very flavorful and nice and juicy. To top it all off, it was very mouth watering to watch it cooked in front of me. My friend ordered the lobster spaghetti and that was really good also. My only complaint is the side dishes they offer: chard, a nice side, onions(which in my mind were overly sweetened and gross covered in a milky substance), some steamed veggies, brussel sprouts, etc. They don't have a POTATO dish as a side. This really bothered my because for a vegetable side, they should definitely provide some type of roasted potato. It would have been the perfect complement to my pork dish. Dessert: was amazing: chocolate tort, bananas, and some nuts I believe with some hazelnut mousse. I thought it was superb. All in all, I would go back and give it another shot because I do believe everyone there tried hard however the game needs to be stepped up just a bit.", "author": "Shaz D."}

The entire experience here was unprecedented in terms of food quality, ambience and attentive service.  You yokels that complain about the noise should buy a deli sanwich and go sit in the park. The vibe at the bar with such interesting conversation with other \"foodies\"'was an added delight.", "author": "Rich M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-22", "description": "Two of us had a nice lunch at Cotogna today. We split a salad with warm mushroom over lettuce to start. I had  Taglioni with dungeness crab and my friend had a tortelloni dish with beet and chard. The flavors were very good and the pasta was amazing. There my enthusiasm ends. Tiny and expensive portions mean you walk out hungry. Not a bad place but it feels more like a money making operation than a labor of love. I would definitely go back, if you were paying. I prefer Perbaco for atmosphere and because it has a much more interesting menu, and i didn't walk out hungry.", "author": "Steve P."}

Dishes weren't exactly quick in coming out but considering the quality of the meal and my experiences in Italy I'd say it's meant to be that way. Only reason I didn't give five stars was because the server was less than sincere.", "author": "Heather P."}

I liked the food so much that I scheduled a thank you dinner for a Doctor who has mentored our three Medical School children over the years.  A very, very special person to our family.  She, the Doctor, was brining her 11 year old daughter to join us at Cotogna.  I called to make a reservation three weeks before the dinner.  Last evening we arrived for this special dinner...and were told that they did not have our reservation.  I was rapidly working through how this could have happened...and what was our fallback...as the very pleasant hostess tried to figure out what she could do to help.  Then...this short, huffy, New York-type manager person arrives...to announce...\"We can't do anything here!  Did you call to confirm your reservation?   Who was the person you talked to?  Why don't you try some other place?\"   We are not ones to break lines...or to make stuff up when we have called for a reservation.  While the hostess was really trying to make something work...recognizing that the restaurant likely had a processing problem...the haughty, tackless, 'I'm tough' manager broke the spell!   So, while I'll not be frequenting this establishment again, may I recommend that if you make a reservation...just in the event that you run into Ms. 'I'm really important!'....make note of the time and date of you reservation call, and the name of the person taking the reservation, ask for a return email to confirm the reservation, confirm the reservation two days and one day in advance...and be sure to make a back up reservation nearby.", "author": "Robert S."}

That's fine, but we were rushed from the start, not a good beginning. We were directed to a table for two, laid for three people, one chair squeezed between a bar area and a computer where the wait staff put in their orders. I asked for the next one over. The waiter said it was the same.  I said no it was not, because we would have wait staff brushing by to put in their orders the whole time. Before we even sat down, I was asked what type of water we wanted. We were asked what wine and then what food before we had a good chance to look at the menus. I ordered the squid ink pasta, which was a small portion with two strips of squid and a few tiny clams. It was okay. Delicious pizza with burrata, etc. Sea bass declared to be good. The roasted peaches for dessert were very good. We paid, tipped well, and within a few minutes the waiter took away the bill, totally unprofessional. Then he took the water away! What a rude hint. When the next table was moved nearer, we checked our watches and noticed that we were ten minutes over. Getting up to leave, my friend who was sitting in the banquette, couldn't get up because the gap was closed. This was getting ludicrous. Two nearby waiters including ours finally moved the table so that my friend could escape. We left, but once outside realized just how poorly we had been treated.  I went back in and asked a man at the entry if I could speak to the manager and he said \"Yes.\"  Nothing more. I asked him, \"Are you the manager?\"  \"Yes,\" he said.  I told him about our experience above, noting that I thought the service was utterly unprofessional and that more training was required.  That, I believe, would have to come from the owner, as the manager needed it too. We were three San Francisco high school friends from another age, a nicer one. We were treated in a condescending manner and I can't account for this brand of rudeness. We paid $139.92 for three drinks, one starter, three mains, and three desserts. We left a $30 tip, taking into consideration the $4.96 for \"Healthy-SF4%.\" I didn't mind paying that, as someone needs help here.", "author": "Maria D."}

As often as I eat out, I have never seen that at a restaurant before and I love the concept.  I was super excited to eat here and was only had one free night when I was in town to go.  I sat at the bar by myself and felt completely comfortable doing so.  Unfortunately , I ordered completely wrong.  I asked the bartender for some suggestions and he whiffed.  I started with the Burrata with ramps and breadcrumbs.  The burrata was fine but the other flavors on the plate were slightly bitter.  Then I had the tagliatelle with rock shrimp.  I was so disappointed.  It was had no flavor at all.  The sauce was less exciting than Ragu. I don't believe it had one single herb in it.   The reason I have given this restaurant 4 stars is because I know every other pasta, pizza and meat dish on the menu is about 100x better.  What can I say, I fudged up.  I am looking forward to returning to SF and coming here and ordering anything other than what I had because I know it will be great.  BTW, I love the rustic Italian atmosphere but I cannot imagine coming for lunch or before sunset.  It just would be a bit of a downer to come in here on a beautiful sunny day.  Much more of an evening happy place.", "author": "Jackie S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-15", "description": "If this place didn't have so much hype, this would probably be a 3 star review. I made a reservation for a Sunday night because that was all I could get reserving 30 days in advance. My bad, but I didn't know about the Sunday prix fixed menu & the woman who called to confirm my reservation did not mention it. I've eaten at other restaurants on nights they only offer a prix fixed menu & they always mention it when confirming reservations. Nonetheless, I was excited to try the 4 courses & I got the wine pairings. I felt the wine was decently paired, but the pours were very inconsistent & quite reserved. The only standout dish was the gnocchi, which I thought was very good. But the squid salad & spit roasted pork were very uninspired & just okay. The dessert was also just okay, a bit dry (though it was a brioche). All in all, I was very disappointed after hearing all the great things about this place. There are too many good restaurants in SF, I don't feel the need to try Cotogna again. It was also very loud & my bf and I had a very difficult time hearing each other without including the table next to us in our conversation.", "author": "Shannon S."}

Like most of the reviewers, I have to agree that the pastas are the stars at this small warm restaurant. I am not a gnocchi fan but theirs is so light and airy and perfect with the refreshing crab and peas that I may not be a convert, but will order it again here! The romaine salad with the bay shrimp is a perfect size for two to split. The yellowtail crudo is delicious but of course like most yellowtail dishes - you are left wanting more! I have tried 4 of the pasta dishes here and all were stellar. I also tried the pork loin and I am not a fan of this dish. The portion is way too small and it was really nothing special. One thing that I must stress is to order their housemade bread - it is sinful!!! If you do not like butter though - do not order it. It is dripping with its deliciousness! We ordered the Bomboloni for dessert both times and I really do like them. Perfectly light little donuts. We had a wonderful server both times I was there. Very attentive and warm without being intrusive. Love that. Will definitely be back for more!", "author": "M S."}
