My favorite part of their sandwiches is the freshly baked bread. They toast it, so it has a perfect crunch to the outside with a soft, chewy inside. I had the Turkey Royal Sandwich, which came with bacon (which I usually don't eat, but did anyway), Swiss cheese, and avocado. Even though these are ingredients that are commonly offered at other sandwich places, I think Good Eats puts their own spin on it and it's worth eating again...and then again. \n\nI didn't dine in, but they do have some tables. If the line goes out the door, a few tables may feel a bit crowded, but I've noticed this is just how it is at popular lunch spots are in SF.", "author": "Lori C."}

I'm always looking for a new place to grub, especially when trying to eat healthy-ish (Mixt Greens, The Plant) all great but can get repetitive. Thanks to MealPass (the ClassPass for lunch in SF) this was a new place added as of last week and decided to reserve the \"Chicken Pesto Sandwich & Salad.\" It's right on Pine St. in the midst of FiDi, so accessible by many. The cafe itself is super cute, family owned vibe. Very warm service and they immediately baked the sandwich that I had reserved. \n\nI have to say it was AWESOME and not overwhelming in a I can't walk now vibe, but super filling and delicious, with a hint of healthy still there. The bread was fresh baked and the melt of the cheese and pesto was so so yummy. My friend even tried and loved it. They provided a green salad and some cookies, which was a nice touch. Outside of MealPass, I believe that they charge around $9 for such a meal, which is REALLY good in the area.

I decided to ask a woman at the register if she would recommend something. She said: \"It depends what you like. Everything is popular\". Oh common, I'm asking for maybe go-to must haves! Anyway, I ordered the spicy chicken with eggplant wrap with a side of Caesar salad. Salad was meh, and the panini (wrap) was below 3/5. The chicken in the wrap had a very weird texture, like it was undercooked (rubbery, but not tough), but it didn't look undercooked- so I'm not sure what it was but I took all the chicken out of the sandwich and just ate the bread and the eggplant.

But Fayala always has a line and has delicious smells wafting from its doors, and after a year of being in the neighborhood I have yet to visit.\n\nToday I resolved to get a sandwich at Good Eats, despite very mediocre reviews from my fellow Yelp friends. The sandwich was traditional but tasty, decently priced, smaller than Miss Tomato/Cafe Algiers, and felt lighter. I'd recommend to those who are looking for more unique combinations (they have wasabi chicken flavor!), and prefer a less carb-heavy sandwich (their fresh bread is light and fluffy).\n\n* PASTRAMI ROYALE SANDWICH ($8.70) - 4 STARS: \nPastrami, sauteed mushrooms, carmalized onion, swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes on toasted rye (swapped with the French Roll), add complimentary Caesar Salad. There was a good amount of sliced pastrami, which paired well with the airy bread and bacon - filling and satisfying without weighing you down. They added mayo which overpowered it even though I asked for it \"light\". Side salad was tiny but a refreshing compliment to the sandwich.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty traditional, small, but satisfying sandwich which stands out because of their homemade fresh-baked bread. I prefer a heavier, carbier sandwich (a la Algiers and Tomato) but would definitely return to mix up the routine.

Not that I don't think the owners are hard-working and proud of their business, but there's just something that always feels a little tired the few times I've come to get a sandwich.

It's a more modest shop serving just sandwiches, salads and wraps, all of which can be found in any number of shops in this part of the FiDi (photo: http://bit.ly/1ftCNuU).

The falafel themselves were crisp on the outside and moist in the middle.  The vegetables in the wrap were fresh.  The only real disappointment was the white sauce - terribly bland.

So A++ for the score.  \n\nThe owner is super nice and great customer service everytime! \n\nAs for lunch, I don't think I can find a place that beats their freshly-baked French bread on their sandwiches.  The bread is simply awesome!  My personal favorite is their wasabi trio, which comes with their special wasabi sauce.  The sandwich is of substantial size, which comes with a side salad, all for $9 bucks.

It was on my second or third visit that I told him I wanted to sing his praises all over Yelp.\n\nI think the first thing I tried was the Greek Wrap (Med wrap? I forget its name) - the wrap itself thin, not so thin as to fall apart, but also not so thick you feel like you're filling up on dough. There's a great balance of delicious contents, the kalamata olives are a-plenty  and the homemade hummus is creamy and flavorful. This is my go-to lunch pick, only when I'm super hungry though, considering it's size is close to that of a large burrito. \n\nThere sandwiches are also pretty spectacular, I've tried quite a few and they're all stuffed to capacity with meats and amazing homemade sauces (I think everything is homemade, I know the bread absolutely is!). Anytime I get a sandwich for lunch I end up with half of it leftover for the next day, this is likely because I eat super slowly and because it comes with a side salad as well. \n\nBreakfast? Breakfast here is so tasty I had to stop going in as much as I was. Their sesame seed bagels and blueberry muffins are so moist and flavorful I would eat one every single day if my metabolism was much faster and more respectful of all the bread-y goodness I'd like to indulge in. The breakfast burritos are magical, let me tell you. The eggs are fluffy, the cheese is cheesy, and that sauce explodes deliciousness in your moth - WARNING - may also explode on your keyboard, use caution and many napkins.\n\nThe owner is friendly and always remembers how I like my coffee. Please visit this place, considering the neighborhood prices are low and quality is high. I can get a bagel and cream cheese with coffee for about 4 bucks - you know that's unusual for the area!

I've eaten there half a dozen times and tried a different sandwich every time (with the exception of pumpernickel bread, I can't defy it!) seeing if there is a hole in their game.  There isn't.  I might as well call Good Eats \"church\" because I always leave fed.  Amen!  \n\nThe service is always nice no matter who is taking care of you.  The prices are cheap especially considering the volume you're returned.  Your sandwich never takes more than a matter of minutes.  The produce is always cool, fresh, and crisp; a wonderful contrast to the warm, soft, just baked bread.  From pastrami and swiss to chipotle chicken, these sandwiches are hefty for your money and hearty to your appetite.  The little side salad is a nice touch.  It makes you feel like you didn't pay solely for a sandwich.  On nearly every occasion I have ended up saving the other half of my sandwich for the following day.

It's nestled between the uninspired Subway and the overly-hyped Chez Fayala. \n\nYes, I said it, overly-hyped Chez Fayala.", "author": "Amberjae F."}

It had the right amount of spice and bite! Plus the roll is delicious! The second time I went there, I had the California BLT, which is a regular BLT with avocado! With that, the bacon is thick cut applewood bacon, who wouldn't love that! Will come here when I want to treat myself to a great lunch!", "author": "Linda L."}

But Good Eats is the notable exception, and thank goodness for that. Not only is the home-made bread fantastic, but the sandwich meat is fresh and excellent as well. And you get a good-sized salad for no additional charge. Bottom line is that you can get a fresh, excellent meal for less than eight bucks at Good Eats. And that is a rarity downtown.", "author": "Chris D."}

The hummus lavash with cucumbers and tomatoes is very fresh (they make their own hummus from scratch, so the owner told me). The fresh roasted turkey is on the spot, heaped high with quality turkey breast, thinly sliced.  Also good is the hot chicken pesto. I love supporting the new guy on the block, and this place does not disappoint. There's not a huge menu, but what they do have they do right. For the FiDi, the prices are also quite reasonable. \n\nGood Eats, indeed!", "author": "Jen M."}

Delicious, filling, mouth-watering breakfast wraps. My favorite is the Roasted Red Bell Pepper with Pesto. \n\nSince breakfast was so good, I decided to come here for lunch a few days later. Their sandwiches are pretty bomb. They also come with a choice of spring or ceasar salad. I've had about 3 different sandiches from them (forgot which ones), but each one was great and filling. \n\nIt's a good place, decent prices, and usually the Baklava is $1 IF you order it with one of the lunch specials. \n\nThe people that work there are also really nice and give great service. \n\nIt's a cute place, with good music, good food, and good service. I wish this place was by my home too.", "author": "Katia T."}

It is consistently good and offers a great variety of sandwiches for lunch.  In fact, the sandwiches are amazing -- they bake their own sandwich rolls daily whic makes all the difference.  For breakfast or to satisfy a sweet tooth, the scones are melt in your mouth delicious.  The owner always has a smile on his face and the service is fast.  What more does a person need from a great breakfast/lunch spot?  Our office even had a breakfast meeting catered from this delightful place.", "author": "James S."}

I got a roasted turkey sandwich and it was delicious.\n\nFirst, they bake their own fresh bread every day. It was very soft and delicious, with a nice crispy crust.\n\nThe turkey and toppings (mmm cranberry) were yummy and plentiful.\n\nThird, the price was very reasonable. $6.50 for a good size sandwich. Plenty for lunch. Also only slightly more than Subway, but taste-wise, a much better deal.\n\nI can't wait to go back and try other sandwiches (pesto chicken, maybe the hummus sandwich). They also had some good looking coffee drinks and Mighty Leaf tea. The pastry case by the register proved to be very tempting as well. All in all, a great FiDi lunch spot!", "author": "Bea G."}

I was lured in by the chalkboard special.. chicken salad with rosemary and cranberries or something like that. It was delicious!
