Oren's Hummus sounded promising and a nice change from what we usually eat.\n\nThere's a takeout section and a sit down portion. We decided to eat our dinner there. Our waiter was awesome and made the meal even more enjoyable. He went for the Beef Skewer entree with Oren's Eggplant dip and Falafels. I had the Hummus Beef. Both meals were served with hot fluffy pita bread (you can choose white, wheat, or gluten free pita options). I've had hummus many times before but this was the best tasting hummus I can remember. It also didn't hurt that it was served with spiced ground beef. His Oren's Eggplant was also super delicious and I could've eaten more of that.\n\nIt was more food than I had expected.

The menu is large, and everything is healthy. You truly can't lose here. I decided to order the rice bowl, and WOW, was I glad I did! This bowl came loaded with turmeric-spiced basmati rice, simmered tomatoes, garlic, onions, mint, and parsley, and was topped with chicken. It was so fresh and the flavor was fantastic.

When it popped up as a weekly office lunch option, I figured it was my chance. Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, October 12th around 12:15pm.\n\n*Chicken Schnitzel: Breaded and fried chicken breast with hummus, tomato, cucumber, and pickles, White Pita ($13.95)\n*Quick Fried Cauliflower Florets: With pesto labane ($7)\n*Hummus: Served with Whole Wheat Pita, Small (8 oz.): Includes 1 pita ($6)\n*Bourekas: Cheese ($1.95), Mushrooms ($1.95)\n\nThe best dish out of the three was the cauliflower. Great texture and flavor. Everyone in the office enjoyed it. And it was a huge serving. The schnitzel was okay. Not much filling to pita ratio. I found it too bready. I got the side of hummus and bourekas. The hummus was a good amount. And it was dense. But I found the hummus to be too thick. And I didn't know it was going to be plain, so it didn't have much flavor. It was fine when I added some oil based salad dressing I had at work, but by itself, I didn't really care for it. I did eat some with the bourekas which wasn't too bad. Out of the two pastries, I liked the mushroom one more. It had more flavor with the earthiness of the mushrooms. The cheese one was bland. Not much cheese and too much dough. I kinda ate the inside and discarded the rest.\n\nMaybe I ordered the wrong things, but this just wasn't up my alley. Everything was rather tasteless. If it ever pops up again, I'll give it another go (and probably order something meat centric), but based on everything I ordered, I wasn't impressed. I would have rated them 2 or 2.5 stars, but the cauliflower bumped them up to 3. It saved my meal.", "author": "Elena N."}

I'm pretty picky about Middle Eastern food because essentials like falafel and pita are more often than not disappointing. Nearly everything I tried at Oren's exceeded my expectations! There are several SOMA/FiDi falafel spots I just can't justify returning to after experiencing Oren's.\n\nTwo of us shared 2 dips/sides combos of 3/$12.50 (so 6 total), which was plenty of food and a great deal. It came with 3 pita (we were supposed to get 4, but whatever, it was enough). The run down:\n\n- Whole wheat pita: Warm, fluffy, thick, and wonderful. Competes with James Beard nominee pita I've had, which was mind-blowing.\n- Small hummus: This was the disappointment of the bunch and tasted pretty average without any particularly special flavor. Perhaps that's why they have all the fancier hummus options to up-sell you.\n- Babaganoush: Our favorite! Wonderful flavor and texture.\n- Labane: quite reminiscent of plain cream cheese; I would have liked more za'atar.\n- Falafel: Great crunchy outside without being oily, soft inside, and nice flavor from the tahini drizzle. \n- Carrots: yum!\n- Traditional Tabule: This won me over. Usually I'm not a tabouli fan because the parsley is heavy-handed but this dish showed restraint.\n\nWhile we were content and full, we decide to try the Turkish coffee (definitely had that trademark sludge at the bottom) and chocolate babka, which had wonderful warm gooey chocolate and was a little crunchier than I expected.\n\nService made a couple flubs but was still pleasant. The interior decor is quite elevated for a fast casual spot.

In fact, I could not more highly recommend this dining establishment as a great place for a quick bite or for an extended lunch for those who love traditional Mediterranean food from around the entire area like Hummus, Tabula, Babaganoush, Shakshuka, and Fatush.\n\nWe came on early on a Friday evening for an early dinner because we had just experienced a great exhibition at the nearby SFMOMA and my dining mate and I were famished. Thankfully, they do have a give you a bowl of pickled cabbage and carrots in a vinegar sauce for you to nosh on. The menu is quite extensive with a variety of their signature hummus bowls, a majority of which were served with a side dish such as cauliflower and mushrooms. We were intrigued by the proteins on the menu that accompanied the hummus's including the lamb, chicken and beef. Also intriguing to the both of us were the beef skewers served with all natural ground beef and lamb with blended herbs and garlic, drizzled with tahini. With that dish we got to select two sides which are separated into two categories: dips and sides. We went with the Babaganoush Eggplant which was fire roasted eggplant mashed with tahini, garlic and herbs and the Marinated Beets which were steamed beets in apple cider cilantro vinaigrette. The beef skewers were four huge meatball pieces that were slightly overcooked on the grill which made them drier than they could have been, but were seasoned nicely and to add a little heat they give you the option of two sauces on every table: red hot chili pepper which were spicy in flavor and jalapeno serrano pepper which was more savory and cool in flavor. Beware the chili pepper was very spicy to your tongue so much so I had to drink multiple glasses of water to cool my taste buds.  \n\nAs for the hummus, a friend who had previously been, suggested the Hummus Lamb which was the Classic Hummus topped with pomegranate braised lamb shoulder with fresh mint. The Hummus Bowls come with two pita breads of your choice, while the grilled entrees like the skewers come with just one. We went with the traditional white pita bread and with three full circular pieces that was more than enough. In fact my best suggestion is to pace yourself and to stick with what you get with your meal and then you can order additional pita breads as it cost an additional eighty cents and can get pretty filling.\n\nWe loved our time at Oren's, the interior is a bit of a mix match with a grand chandelier in the center of the dining room with menu images along the interior wall that felt more at home at a fast casual restaurant like Panera Bread rather than a fining dining establishment they are trying to set up. There was a minor rush as we were sat along with three other tables and my dining mate was famish so she was disappointed when our server was a little overwhelmed with the service. But the food is the real star here. Overall everything tasted great, well seasoned and interesting. I've never had hummus with a protein like lamb and it tasted great. The surprise was the Babaganoush which I had never had with eggplant and had a real kick to it. I can wait to go back and sample more of their dishes. It sounds cliche, but Oren's is bringing authentic Mediterranean to the masses in a contemporary setting at affordable prices.

Well, they fill the menu out with kabobs and sandwiches, but otherwise, it's hummus time (photo: http://bit.ly/2voNC2p). I don't mind as I love hummus and keep pretending it's a low-calorie protein option despite the exorbitant amount of tahini and olive oil that goes into it. I came in really early for supper, around 4:30PM, so there were barely any customers. It's a cavernous space, much bigger than the one in Palo Alto.\n\nWhat struck me was the number of staff running around since most of them appeared to be in training.

Very creamy and packed with pur\u00e9ed chickpeas though carrying more olive oil than I was hoping. It came with a pita bread and I went for the Whole Wheat - fluffy, tasty, and probably more carbs than I deserved.\n\nThe second side was the Chunky Eggplant which they turned almost into a ratatouille with tomatoes and garlic (photo: http://bit.ly/2O0dDfR). Chunky was right and delicious, too. It also came with pita bread, but I rejected it because I didn't want to OD on starches. In fact, my third dish responded to my gluttony with freshness, the Small Israeli Salad, which consisted of chunks of cucumber and tomato with parsley, lemon juice, and of course, olive oil (photo: http://bit.ly/2At90ZT).

At first I was a bit skeptical of eating hummus with meat but it totally works! The lamb was tender and full of flavor, a bit sweet from the pomegranate molasses. The hummus was so creamy and smooth and it's nutty and not super sour like a bunch of the other hummuses. I basically licked my plate. I will be coming here often to get my fix :).", "author": "Alice W."}

We went here around 1:30 p.m and it was pretty busy.  It took a few minutes, but we got a table.  I sat and absorbed the menu because there was so much to choose from! I decided to go for a more traditional Israeli dish. I got the Hummus with the cauliflower and it doesn't seem like it is going to be filling because it's not huge, but it is!  I was full for hours.  We also shared one of the eggplant sides which was also delicious.  Oh I almost forgot, the pita bread!!!!  By far the best I've had.  I got the whole wheat and my fiance had the regular.  The pieces are big and fluffy and warm!! Can't wait to go back for more.\n\nThis place is beautifully decorated and very classy, which is why I was a bit confused about the brown \"paper cloths\" on each table.  I don't understand why they have them.  The tables must be easy to clean and the tables are very nice to begin with.  To me it made it look cheap and it is wasteful. Another thing was and this may be nit picky, but for such a nice place I felt like the shirts the waiters wore looked like a fast food joint and I was confused it this place was supposed to more formal or not.  At any rate, lovely place with very original and yummy food.  Another nice gesture was one of the owners came out to greet us and that was very sweet and thoughtful.  They also have a take out window that I will use in the future!  I will definitely be back!", "author": "Megan M."}

The fluffy and light pita that accompanied it was exquisite and I would go back just for that. It's a little pricey, but one serving provides enough for one person. \n\nI also ordered the Shakshuka which is one of my favorite egg dishes of all time.

With an extremely hummus (and adjacent dips) centric menu, it's quite apparent what you need to order.  I opted for the main entree plate of hummus since it seemed more novel than a sandwich or a dip.  The main entree plate is indeed a great way to break hummus stereotypes.\n\nPickled Cabbage: Comes for free at the table.  Was hoping this would either taste like kimchi or like sauerkraut.  Unfortunately, it tasted like wilted coleslaw.  Not a huge fan, though it was useful to cleanse the tahini off the palate between hummus bites.\n\nHummus Lamb: This was simply delicious.  I'm not a huge fan of refrigerator-cold hummus, which is all too common in the U.S.  Something about this warm fluffy hummus just rocked my world.  The lamb chunks were tender and full of flavor, a perfect complement to the mellow pureed chickpeas.  Even better when scooped on some pita bread and topped with green harissa.\n\nPitas: These are definitely *not* those sorry pita frisbees you get from a bag.  They were super fluffy, but you can still split them in the middle.  Nice and sturdy for getting a lot of hummus on to each torn off piece.\n\nFalafels: Tiny, yet delicious.  Perfectly crunchy exterior with soft and grainy inside.  Why not eat chickpeas with your chickpeas?\n\nLemonade: Probably the only truly disappointing item I paid for.  It was overly tart with way too much ice.  Felt like the drink was gone after only a few sips.  Could use more sugar and less ice.", "author": "Adam B."}

But a few weeks ago a coworker of mine was eating hummus for lunch and insisted I try it. It was the best I'd ever had and the bread was so soft and delicious -- I needed to know where this delicious hummus was from, and she said Oren's.\n\nLuckily that wasn't too long before Oren's finally opened in San Francisco, so I didn't have much of a wait before I got to have some of that hummus again. Oren's is both a sit down and take out restaurant, so you can either walk into the side entrance to grab some food to-go or head into the main entrance to eat at the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant was pretty packed on a Thursday night after 6 but we were seated right away. Our waiter was extremely friendly and took the time to explain how the menu worked and recommended a couple of dishes. We went with the classic hummus ($8.95), chicken pita sandwich ($12.95), fries ($4.95), and babaganoush.\n\nService was pretty slow. The servers seemed to be focusing the majority of their attention on a large party in the middle of the restaurant, which was putting a strain on their ability to serve everyone else. But because they'd only been open a couple weeks when I was there, a manager was walking around and asking every table how their evening was going, to get a feel for any service kinks that needed to be ironed out.\n\nWhen the food finally came I was wowed by the portion sizes but even more so by how delicious everything was. I already knew the classic hummus was great but there's nothing like having it with fresh-from-the-oven pita bread. (Every extra piece is .80 cents but each \"piece\" is a whole pita.) The chicken pita sandwich was the highlight of the meal for me: grilled chicken, hummus, cucumber, tomatoes, pickles, and tahini. Everything came together in an amazing mix of flavors, the pita was stuffed, and even though I shared the sandwich with my boyfriend I secretly wanted to eat the whole thing myself because it was so good. The fries were really good, steak cut, and served in a very generous portion. I'm not a babaganoush fan but my boyfriend loved it.\n\nWe were left with some hearty leftovers after the meal and figured that the next time we go, we'd be good just ordering the classic hummus and one other dish, rather than the sides we also ordered. Other than the slow service, all of the food here was delicious, portions were large, and the servers were all very friendly. Will definitely be back.", "author": "Angela M."}

The babaganoush had a garlicky taste that went really well with the eggplant, and served as a nice counterbalance to the hummus.\n\nThe rest of the food though was quite disappointing. The beef kebabs were really dry, and kind of hard in places. It no longer had that nice juicy taste I usually expect from the kebabs, it was just dry.

We then ordered a couple things to share family style. \n\nWe ordered 6 bourekas: 3 mushroom and 3 potatoes. These were small pastries with some filling inside. The pastry itself was perfect -- quite flaky and buttery. The mushroom filling was quite unique and interesting, and the potato one provided a good hearty taste.\n\nNext for the hummus, we ordered a side of babaganoush eggplant hummus, as well as the lamb hummus bowl. This came with some pita bread for the table. The pita was incredibly fresh, warm, and huge, so you can just dip whatever you want on it. I personally didn't like the baganoush eggplant that much -- had a strange peculiar taste that I wasn't used to. The lamb hummus was OK, though I wish there was a bit more meat for the dish.\n\nWe also got the shakshuka, which was quite underwhelming and not worth it for the price, as it was basically tomato sauce and eggs. It also didn't seem to go that well with pita, in my opinion. \n\nWe got the rice bowl as well with falafels, which was definitely the highlight. The basmatic rice was very flavorful and falafels were perfect.\n\nBecause we were lacking meat, we also got an ala carte beef skewer to share.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-27", "description": "I would give this Oren's location in San Francisco zero stars if I could. While I have never stepped foot inside the physical restaurant, I have ordered from them through Caviar six times. On all but one occasion, they have made major mistakes when completing my order. \n\nToday was the absolute last straw, as it was the most unprofessional and unacceptable delivery experience I have ever had by far. \n\nHere's what I ordered: two orders of hummus, two orders of falafel, and four red sauces on the side. Here's what I received: ONE order of falafel, ONE order of hummus, and ZERO red sauces. The missing items alone were bad enough, especially because it's a recurring theme with them, but that wasn't even close to the worst part.\n\nThe real issue was this: The hummus they delivered was PACKAGED, as in, the way you would buy it from a supermarket. AND IT HAD AN EXPIRATION DATE STICKER LISTING TOMORROW'S DATE (see attached image). It legitimately appears as if an employee decided that it was a good idea to send a paying delivery customer their oldest, expiring, packaged hummus because they didn't want to have to throw it away. Never in my life have I experienced a more wretched example of \"food service.\"\n\nAnd like I said initially, they've royally screwed up all but one of my six orders. On July 21, I only received one order of hummus when I ordered two. On July 22, the order took over two hours to be delivered and the $7 sweet potato fries \"with red pepper mayo\" that I ordered didn't come with red pepper mayo. On July 29, I only received one order of falafel when I ordered two. On August 24, the $7 sweet potato fries \"with red pepper mayo\" didn't come with any red pepper mayo again, and there was only one red sauce when I explicitly requested four. (On August 10, by some miracle it seems, they actually got my order right.)\n\nI have tried to give this restaurant a fair shake. I have been a loyal Oren's customer since they opened their doors in downtown Palo Alto many years ago. That location, in person and through Caviar, has always served me well and never let me down. \n\nI never write bad reviews on Yelp. I never call restaurants to complain. But my experience with this Oren's location in San Francisco has been so atrocious that I felt it my duty to do both. The employee and manager I spoke to on the phone were nice enough, but it's too late for apologies. I will never order from them again, and I suggest you avoid them as well.\n\nOren's is pretty tasty, but it is absolutely not worth the headache if ordering delivery from the San Francisco location. They have permanently lost my business and I will be telling anyone who will listen not to go there or order from them.\n\nExtra note: I just remembered that about four of the six times I ordered from here, the falafel was cold and tasted stale.", "author": "Ben K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-17", "description": "While the food never disappoints, 4/6 of my last visits have had some mix of food delivery issues (order mixed up, 15 m. late delivery on an order placed 24 hours in advance, 1 hour dine-in time from order to food). Manager Gaetano (apologies if I butchered that) was very gracious and receptive to feedback, and I'm optimistic about service improvements soon (still optimistic as of 8/20, last issue).\n\nFOOD:\nOren's is the Bay Area champ of hummus--it's rich-tasting without overwhelming the palate, incomparably smooth, and Oren's signage would suggest it's lower in Calories than standard hummus as well (idk and idc, really). I don't love that sugar is added to nearly every non-hummus dish (perhaps the hummus too)\n\nBe warned--green hot sauce is HOT. Red is milder (~Israeli chipotle pepper?) and for those with medium+ spice tolerance can be generously poured over any entree.\n\n- Pita is generally fluffy (2x it was slightly stale on 1/4 of the border) and always warm--I love the feeling of ripping apart a pita here! It's a lovely balance of dense (filling!) and soft with beautifully sized yeast bubbles.\n\n- Hummus cauliflower: Hummus base topped with cauliflower and golden raisins--a tad sweet for my tastes, but a fun and tasty combo\n\n- Hummus eggplant: Hummus base topped with roasted eggplant, cauliflower, and garlic. MY FAVORITE! Again, the roasted eggplant is a tad sweet\n\n- Veggie skewer: Be warned that veggies are a little greasy from the grill, so if you were ordering the veggies for \"clean eating,\" this is not the answer. That said, it's nice to have some vitamins in there and have the choice of two sides (whoo!). Only sad part for me is the single pita included (v. two with the hummus bowls)\n\n- Marinated beets: Beet are chopped finely and tossed in a vinaigrette--a bit too sour for me when I'm looking to experience the natural sweetness of beetness :)\n\n- Hummus lamb: the pomegranate marinade was a bit overwhelming and drowned out the more subtle flavors of the lamb. Enjoyable still, but I wouldn't order again\n\n- Flash-fried cauliflower--expectedly greasy, but as clean as it gets with flash-fried (Shishito level grease). Fun!\n\n- Classic Shakshouka--this was overwhelmingly sweet and neither of us wanted to finish it--would recommend toning down the sweetness or switching tomatoes (if canned) to let more of the tomatoes' natural flavors sing in the dish. \n\nSERVICE: For to go orders, online ordering makes it easy! Service is exceedingly friendly, but I've had issues 3/5 visits here (forgotten or swapped items in to go orders)--do a quick check before you leave the store. \n\nIn store, there was a \"computer issue\" during opening week that resulted in us sitting without food for 1.5 hours. While this was a pretty unacceptable situation, all staff were incredibly apologetic. \n\nAMBIANCE: Separate dine-in and to-go storefronts (connected within though) preserve the charm of the dine-in area. Great for a quick weekday lunch or a languorous Sunday brunch :). \n\nDine-in: while it's a casual eatery, I appreciate the small touches that make this feel more upscale--booths, reasonably spaced tables (for SF), and decor make it a place I'd enjoy going on a date (given how excellent the food is :)). Rich in succulents and shiny objects (mirrors, large & slightly gaudy chandelier), inside there's plenty to look at if eye contact isn't what you're looking for :). Dine-in menu includes more meat and special entrees, as well as \"Israeli favorites\" (e.g., shakshouka). SF is the only location with breakfast, so give it a try if you're in town!\n\nTo go: Order ahead online from Oren's site or walk in for some grab and go options! Within the store or online, one can order all the sandwich, hummus bowl, skewer, and salad options. Given past order issues with 1-20 items, I would suggest you count everything before you leave lest you have to return. \n\nThere's a cold case on the right with pre-packaged sides you can grab if in a hurry or for a group meal in a pinch. Buy 3 sides, get one free! I don't think you can go wrong with anything in the case :).", "author": "Helen W."}

I noticed that instead of charging for $38.10 which was our bill, they charged me two different amount on my credit card. They charged $19.05 (the amount that I divided with my friend since we used two credit cards to pay) and $31.56 ( the lady bills) on my credit card. I am so upset right now since I have to call my bank and notified them. This is really annoying since it's wasting my time. I would not want to come back here again.

Just as good as the hummus at the other locations and still better than most hummus I try elsewhere.    The spicy red and green sauces were delicious too.\n\nPitas are thick - rip them to tiny pieces to scoop up the hummus.\n\nI took mine to go and was a little worried when I saw some of the first reviews indicating a little than longer wait time.  But the counter-person told me up front that it would be a little longer and the reason why (the eggplant takes a little longer to prepare).  As long as I know the length of the wait and the why, that's good.

Unfortunately the quality of the food just isn't the same. The pita bread isn't as good as it is at the other locations and one of the pita was so drenched in olive oil and still raw, I couldn't eat it.

I had the lamb hummus, as did my husband, and our friend had the beef kabobs. The lamb was a lot sweeter than I expected it to be. Maybe a little too sweet. The hummus itself and the pita bread were good. Our friend seemed to enjoy the beef kabobs, too.

The woman's response (she was conducting the meeting) - \"oh that must've affected the experience.\" After I picked up my jaw, I alerted our waiter. His response was barely an acknowledgment and then he brought our bill. I can only gather by their nonchalant responses that this must happen a lot?! Perhaps they should include \"shells\" as an ingredient?\n\nAlthough there was no concern from them, I did feel it my duty to provide this PSA for future patrons - eat slowly as there might be an extra, unexpected crunch.\n\nAs for me, I will stick to Trader Joe's hummus hereafter.", "author": "Jeanette L."}

I don't think a week has gone by yet since it's opened that I haven't heard someone or another saying they're going to eat here or pick up food from their fast food side. The food is tasty and filling and comes fairly quickly. I've been here a few times now, and I haven't been disappointed by the food (I usually order a hummus bowl, but a different one each time - for my most recent visit, I had the hummus sabich). The owner/manager (not sure which) has also come by multiple times to check on the table and make any corrections if needed. I feel inclined to mention the corrections because while the food is good and the service is friendly, they have messed up my order three times already (during different visits). Every time there was an issue, they didn't bring to the table the expected number of pita (based on the number of bowls at the table), and one time the order itself was wrong (I was brought a sandwich instead of a bowl, but that was quickly remedied and, of course, I wasn't charged for the mistake entree). Based on other reviews, it looks like these aren't isolated cases which is pretty disappointing. Since it's convenient for my office, I'd like to continue coming here regularly, but I would be hesitant to continue if these mistakes keep happening.", "author": "Bianca C."}
