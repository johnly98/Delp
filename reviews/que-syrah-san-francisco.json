I was impressed that this teeny tiny wine bar was able to accommodate our party of 14. We were about 20 minutes late (running on Chinese time) but we did not get any type of attitude thrown at us at all. We had plenty of wine from 8:30 PM  - closing time and our bill came out more than reasonable.

I was surprised, then, at how much I loved it when I returned three years later (in the evening, in better company). \n\nQue Syrah has an extensive wine selection and the ambiance is warm and cozy. What really made our experience, however, was the owner (?)/ sommelier. I had asked a question about a wine I decided not to try, and when he brought over the glass I did order, he also brought along a taste of the wine I inquired about. He then brought us two more complimentary tastes, saying that because they were closed the following day, we might as well finish some of the inventory. \n\nThis will be the new stop after pizza at Paradise Pizza and Pasta.

She's very pushy, highly recommending (forcing me to visit) this comfy and intimate wine bar with a relatively nondescript fa\u00e7ade; I told her, \"whatever will be will be.\"  Thus, I found myself at 'Que Syrah'.\n\nMy friends and I walked in after a large dinner, at around 6ish, and were immediately relaxed (the itis/food coma played a factor) by the soothing lighting and intimate, comfortable atmosphere.  We came on a great night; or what would have been a great night if we hadn't stuffed our faces earlier. \n\nIt was tapas night.  There was an incredibly large menu of tapas, including 'lech\u00f3n kawali', which I believe is (or should be) Tagalog for amazing.  It had all the mouthwatering elements of crunchy, tender, savory, and pork-y.  This tapas menu offered the wonderful creations of a local caterer.  I think his name was Val.  We even tried his exceptionally roasted, sweet and slightly spicy Marcona Almonds, that paired well with my glass of  'Hocus Pocus Syrah'.\n\nThe extra-generous pour into our full-bodied adventure at 'Que Syrah' was the extremely helpful and welcoming staff - they were attentive and helpful without being pushy and condescending.  I am quite an amateur when it comes to drinking wine - much less at a niche wine bar - and their consideration, and wonderful tapas, supplied me and my friends with an experience worthy of five stars.\n\nI will say thought that because it's a small space, seating is limited.  I, however, like to stand; I believe it to be a more engaging experience that way.  I know that most would disagree.  Oh well, like they say (or should say), \"Que syrah, syrah.\"\n\nPositives:\n- Friendly, Intimate and Comfortable Atmosphere\n- Helpful and Attentive Staff\n- Friendly Customers\n- Delicious Tapas\n- Great Wine\n- Generous Pouring\n\nNegatives:\n- Prices Steeply Escalate with each Glass & Tapas\n- Limited Seating", "author": "Phillip W."}

I don't live close by at all - no fault of the establishment\n2. You can't bring a baby here - now this is somewhat of a blurry area for me. While I understand that a wine bar cannot have babies or anyone under 21, I was under the impression that any place that had food, you COULD have babies. I've been to multiple wine bars that people were able to bring their babies or kids. I was at a private party and two people I knew were not allowed to bring their baby, so I am sure that the baby factor wasn't because it would disturb other customers.\n\nAnyways, if you live in the neighborhood and you like wine, this is not a bad place to spend time with a few close friends.

However, there was the tasting menu which was a Cabernet Sauvignon flight - 3 wines from S. Africa, Sonoma, and  El Dorado. Made my decision easy! For $12 to taste 3 wines, not bad. And they were generous in pouring too!\n\nThey have a happy hour special on Tuesdays between 4 and 8pm. I believe it's a $1 off a glass. If you're interested, give them a call for specifics.", "author": "Lynn F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-05", "description": "A friend suggested we head to a wine bar in West Portal.  Although I found the name, \"Que Syrah\" catchy, I was filled with the usual dread at the thought of entering yet another pretentious wine bar where if you don't know what you want, and more importantly can't sum up your first mouthful with at least 7 obscure adjectives, you will feel hopelessly out of place.\n\nThankfully this intimate wine bar tucked away beside a hair boutique and jewelers in West Portal eroded past experiences and shattered stereotypes.\n\nThe guy who served us was relaxed, unpushy and informed us of the wine flight of the week (three Grenache servings for $11).  He gave us time and we felt unrushed in our choice making.  I get easily baffled by all the intriguing names and grape classifications, a lack of confidence from lack of knowledge.  On ordering I tried to give a rough indication of what I liked using very boring words like \"red\" and \"heavy\". The guy was very helpful, made some suggestions and voila!... I had ordered and not felt at all like a loser! My friend had the Gregory Graham 2006 Grenache, Red Hills, Crimson Hill Vine Yard, Lake County ($11) and I tried the Genuine Risk, 2005 Cabernet Sauvignon, Santa Ynez Valley ($11.5) Wow! I was so blown away with it, we ordered the 3 Cheeses with Chorizo ($15).  Again the guy suggested which cheeses would best accompany the wine and we went with:  Seal Bay, Tasmanian Red Square (both Australian, cows milk) and Zamorano (Spanish, sheep's milk).  They were served with ample bread, chorizo & salami and garnished with dried blueberries and apricots. All were delicious but the really rich buttery-ness and hint of nut in the Seal Bay did it for me!\n\nWe opted for another glass and reached out to try something different, choosing Graff Family 2006 \"Consensus\" Syrah Chalone ($9) and Gregory Graham 2006 Zinfandel, Red Hills, Crimson Hill Vine Yard, Lake County ($11) Our \"consensus\" was definitely the most intensive of all the wines, and my favorite of the evening was my original choice Genuine Risk, which had turned out to be a genuine gem.\n\nWe indulged with some Chocolate Truffles: raspberry, hazelnut, earl grey, dark chocolate.  Surprisingly for me, the Earl Grey shone through.\n\nThere's a refreshing ambience to this place. A mellow mixture of World Electronic and Latin Salsa played whilst we sipped on the pressed grapes, quiet enough to carry on a conversation but not low enough to be insipid and irrelevant. The wooden floors and lack of clutter gave it a clean, freshness while the wall tea lights and limited roof spotlights maintained the intimacy.\n\nThe mirrors of varying sizes help elongate the space consisting of two comfy sofas (ideal for a group), four tables each with three chairs.  At the bar there are a further eight seats where you can chat away to the owners. Their service was ideal: not someone in your face every five minutes, but a raise of your eyes and someone is coming to your table instantly.  Prices were reasonable and the staff ready to share their expertise in a friendly, non-superior manner.\n\nWhether you have a small or vast understanding of wines, if you are ever in the West Portal area, please stop by Que Syrah.\n\nWhat will be, will be and you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Angela D."}

I got home to my beloved and the only thing I wanted was a really nice bottle of red wine, over-sized glasses, and a dark, mellow room --and maybe a cheese plate.\n\nI live in the O.M.I.  We don't exactly have wine bars in my hood.  So I suggested, \"that cute little place in West Portal,\" Que Syrah, which was the closest wine bar I could think of.\n\nWe found immediate parking and a locked door in front of a bar full of people.  The sign on the door said, \"CLOSED\".  The posted hours were closed at 10:30 and last call was 10pm.  It was 9:45.  WTF?\n\n I could probably give them some slack for closing early if they were slow, but the place was packed.  I knocked on the door and was blatantly ignored.\n\nIt must be good to have so much business that you don't need to take people's money.  Or maybe it was just a couple snot-nosed college kids running the place who wanted to go home early.  Whatever the reason, next time, I'll take my business downtown --where they stay open until reasonable hours and understand that they have competition.", "author": "Amy A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-03", "description": "Arguably one of the best places in the city to get a glass (or three, or a bottle) of wine.  Here's why:\n\n1) Atmosphere.  Small, neighborhoody place.  It's a no-frills wine bar, meaning that it is not at all pretentious.  You can choose to sit at the bar (my preference), a table, or the couch and coffee table.  Also, they have some good jazz playing.  Kind of like being in a buddy's living room.\n\n2) The service.  The owners (Keith and Stephanie) know their wine.  What's more, they taste every bottle that they open to insure quality.  And it doesn't hurt matters that they are very friendly.\n\n3) The wine.  Let's get down to brass tacks - it's all about the product.  The specialty here is small, passionate producers of quality wine.  It is not uncommon to see a winemaker come in to have them taste some wines for possible inclusion on the list.  The selection is ample and well-balanced, with a weekly flight offering.  And if you have a glass of something you really like, you can buy a bottle to take home at the retail price.\n\nGreat place to get a pre/post-dinner/movie glass.  And they are the only wine bar that I'm aware of that opens before 5pm (3pm here), which has caused me to leave work early a couple of times.", "author": "mcmalaprop .."}

I live 5 minutes from there, and had no idea it existed until I read about it on Yelp (hi, Suzanne B.!)\r\n\r\nI was there during an odd hour - 6pm on a Sunday evening.  So we were the only patrons in the place which makes it hard to judge the vibe. The coffee table and microsuede couches, low lighting, jazz in the background made for a cozy, if somewhat sterile, atmosphere - a bit like dining in a Pottery Barn display (take that as you wish).  There are various tables and a bar for other seating options.\r\n\r\nIt's a little puzzling to decide what to have, as there is not a huge selection of wine by the glass, and I was unfamiliar with most of them.  My brother and his girlfriend ordered a Malbec, which I have to admit was not my favorite (and I adore Malbecs).  I ordered the featured Italian wine flight which was quite good.\r\n\r\nWe had a the cheese plate, which featured a Petit Basque, a Spanish cheese with a paprika rind, and a third cheese which I have forgotten by now.  Portions were ample, but I would not say generous.\r\n\r\nMy experience was nice, but I can't say that it stood out as extraordinary.  However, I am so pleased to have a wine bar in my neighborhood that I will definitely go back.  Service was friendly and the prices were reasonable - also pluses.\r\n\r\nMy next venture will be to check out Happy Hour Tuesdays (4pm-8pm), with $1 off of wines by the glass.   Stay tuned.", "author": "Liz S."}

Not by what was offered in terms of wine (which was excellent!), but by the fact that only about half of the listed wines were offered by the glass.   I tend to prefer lists with more extensive glass offerings.\n\nThe service, however, was impeccable.  I am assuming the gentleman who helped our group is one of the owners - owner or not, he knew his stuff.  He helped each of us select just the right wine for our mood and current taste - and let me tell you, that is a talent, people.  Not everyone can listen to you (especially me since I was half falling asleep from tiredness and too much food and was vaguely incoherent) and determine the keys to your personal taste.  Each of us ended up with a different wine and each was perfectly happy with the choice.\n\nI also liked the atmosphere - though the tall  white walls struck me as a bit too sterile and generic for the rest of the look.  Comfy couches, small round tables, lights around the window, the narrowness of the space - all contribute to a comfortable vibe that invites you to relax and enjoy.", "author": "Suzanne B."}

But a wine bar seems like just the thing West Portal needs.  If only it was right next to Roti, you'd have some major synergy going on.  \n\nI must have walked by here 10 times without noticing it, and in fact I even walked by when I was looking for it.  It's a tiny little nook of a place, with a little bar, a few tables, and a pair of couches with a coffee table.  At 10:00 on a Saturday there was only one other group here, so my guess is it's more of an 8:00 scene.  It's too bad, because I think the experience would have benefited from a little more hustle and bustle.\n\nAs the other reviewers note, they don't have very many wines by the glass, so I just went with the wine flight, which at $12 is a pretty good deal--you get at least 1.5 to 2 glasses worth.  They had a Zin from Amador, a blend from Lodi, and a Petite Syrah from Santa Cruz (my pick of the bunch).  Truthfully, I was kind of caught up in conversation the whole time so I didn't spend too much time judging the wines, but they were definitely solid.\n\nOverall, the atmosphere leans towards the romantic, so this would be a great place to bring a date after dinner, or also to hobnob with a mixed company of oenophile friends.  If you're looking for more of a refined, leather-chair and scotch place to wax philosophical with your man-friends, though, Que Syrah is probably not what you want.", "author": "Wes M."}

This is a totally down to earth wine bar, cozy, comfy, a great place to sit a have conversation with friends or a date. The day we visited we were interested in the Portuguese wine selection (which we were not familiar with), the owner came over and described the wines (which were true to his description) he was so welcoming, it was a great learning experience  :)", "author": "maria a."}

The wine list isn't that extensive or adventurous, but still has plenty to offer and shows knowledge and care.\n\nLimited snack menu; I enjoyed my cheeses.\n\nService is good. She remembered me several months later after only a single visit.", "author": "Nicole A."}

On a warm, lethargic Saturday evening, I stumbled upon Que Syrah with a friend and ended up spending over two hours enjoying a cheese plate, flight of wine (three wonderful European blends), and a not too sweet glass of white wine.  Prices were reasonable, the owners friendly and knowledgeable, and there wasn't this feeling of being rushed.  I'd definitely go back, especially since the couches looked very comfortable.", "author": "A K."}

Stephanie and Keith are always incredibly nice and helpful and it is the only wine bar where I don't feel bad wearing sweats (nice sweats of course).  \n\nThe flights are usually a good choice and a pretty good deal and the almonds are yummy too!", "author": "Katie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-10-10", "description": "I came here when this place had only been opened about 6 months and it is owned by Keith & Stephanie, two really cool people who have turned me into quite a wine snob these days, as well as my friend Kimmers from Burly, Cali.  Onward, they always feature weekly flights like zins, shiraz, merlot's,etc. The hors d' vors trays are stupendous also. They feature cheeses from France, Norway, Denmark, Switzerland, and the US. The duck pate' spread on water crackers, served with seasonal grapes, and finished off with a \"Cannahan Family\" Shiraz 04',  with only about 160 cases per harvest, will knock your little snooty block off. Pleeze visit this place as the service is pleasant and the atmosphere at night is very dim and relaxing. You'll soon be schooled by an exceptional wine bar in S.F. yet as Keith & Stephanie are on the front lines in Napa weekly to test everything that goes into your snappy little gullet..!!!

This establishment is generally manned by one of the two owners who both know their wine. I have been in here four times so far and have enjoyed every glass. Since none of the restaurants in West Portal have waiting rooms, I anticipate that I will be spending a bit more time ;-) in here and I am lookign forward to every sip!", "author": "Frankly G."}

Not only is it a fun place to visit, they do off-sale and can help you choose wines for parties or dinners you have planned which is really helpful.  A friend had a client appreciation party there, and it was fantastic.  The tasting flights they offer have to be the best deal in the city.  Can't recommend it enough.", "author": "Maureen H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-16", "description": "I literally fell upon Que Syrah last night after work and was pleasantly surprised. The owner was very kind, attentive and really knew her wine. I was interested to learn that Que Syrah had been open for 3 years since I have never heard about it. After spending some time tasting various wines with my best friend and enjoying a cheese plate, I realized that this location could be better served by a little creative marketing and a visual make over. Don't get me wrong, it looks fine, but with very little money, it could look even better. The wine list is so great that I think the \"homey\" atmosphere could be upgraded to fit the seriousness of the offerings and the service. Such as real tea lights, not the battery operated variety, in addition to live plants over the bar, not the plastic kind.  And their web page could easily be turned into a full functioning web site that would serve this establishment better. Over all I was pleased and will return, I just see untapped potential at Que Syrah and hope that the owners will add some visual style to a space that has so much potential and get some marketing assistance because they have a great opportunity.", "author": "Michael R."}
