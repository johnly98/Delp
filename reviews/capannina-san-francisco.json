The ambiance inside the restaurant and the service we received was so lovely! \n\nMost of us ordered the prix fixed menu. I chose the caesar salad with super fresh crab (and plenty of it!), and the pappardelle with mushroom and ragu, which was creamy and delicious. My husband ordered the short rib ravioli. I ate a ton of bread with olive oil before our entrees arrived. My favorite course was definitely dessert! Out of the creme brulee, pear tart, and the pannacotta, the pannacott was hands down my favorite. We really enjoyed our entire dinner and this is the perfect place for celebrating birthdays and anniversaries.", "author": "Lizzy L."}

It's hard to get a table for 2 that's not in that area. I find it hard to carry on a conversation, and am constantly distracted by close-by patrons.\n\nOf course, the prices have also gone up a lot in the last number of years since we first started eating there. Us patrons are, of course, having to help pay for the high SF rents. But sometimes it doesn't seem justified, especially for pasta. That said, it's generally standard pricing for the area. Especially for the veal scaloppine which has always been my favorite dish there. And there's a prix fixe menu which is also for a fair price, and generally always good.\n\nThat said, I'm not going to eat there until they stop blocking a loading/unloading spot out front for certain patrons. It's a regular metered space that, at 5PM, becomes a white curb drop off spot. The very reason we have white curbs is to prevent double-parking (rampant on Union Street). Blocking the spot is not legal, and we've asked them to stop. Many times. They keep at it. It is of course not their personal parking space. MTA says they will now be paying close attention to any vehicle parked there after 5PM in the loading/unloading white zone, and will appropriately ticket any there longer than the allotted 5 minutes.

It's a small place with a \"hands on\" owner, who is trying to make sure you have a good experience.\n\nThe Food:  SOLID.  We got the grilled octopus appetizer.  It was nice, especially since it is the most tender octopus you've ever tasted.  But, with the trendy avocado....meh.  I REALLY want to like this, but 3 lonely, tender pieces of tentacle does not an $18 appetizer make.   I'm glad I tried it, but I won't get it again.\n\nThe branzanio (fish) and ravs were quite good, not great but good.  Desserts were top notch!  I especially liked the panna cotta with mango goo.  Yum!\n\nThe place is small, and you're VERY CLOSE to your neighbors.  Meaning, you could take your fork and eat off their plates if you wanted to.  It wasn't bad, but don't expect any privacy and the place is a bit loud for conversation.\n\nWe went early, so parking wasn't that bad...but otherwise I've heard parking is tough (like in lots of areas of SF).\n\nBottom line:  If I'm in the neighborhood, I'm looking forward to trying more stuff.

First of all the bread was tasty with the what I think is pesto oil.  We ordered the squid ink risotto, the potatoes, octopus, truffle beef carpaccio, truffle tagliatelle, and the sea bass.  The waiter recommended the white truffles over the black truffles, but we ended up liking the black truffles more because it seemed more flavorful.  My favorite was the tagliatelle and my husband couldn't stop raving about the octopus.  It was the most tender octopus we have ever eaten.  For dessert we ordered the pear tart with vanilla gelato which was interesting.  The only thing we didn't really care for and thought was overly sweet were the profiteroles.

When you walk by you immediately admire the charm and ambiance that the place exudes. It says, \"Come on in\".\nAs soon as you enter it becomes clear that it's usually packed and it's tight. And it's loud. \n\nThe service is professional and fast moving. You're not going to hear glasses tinkling in here. But if you're young and out for a good time this is your place. The food is authentic although not really cheap (neither are the rents on Union Street), but if you don't mind paying for quality, you won't be disappointed. They have a great selection of wines by the glass, both Italian and California along with a pretty extensive list for a small restaurant. \n\nWhen you see the owner/manager bussing tables, you know management is hands on...and that's reassuring.

The restaurant called to confirm my reservation, and the waiter/owner on the phone was kind of harsh, telling us we had to all be there by 6 because they had a bunch of other reservations after us so we couldn't be running late. We got there at 6 and the restaurant was only half full, and when we left at 7:30, I didn't see groups waiting for us sooo, not sure what the aggression was about.\n\nFood was DELICIOUS though. We started with the squid ink risotto which was amazing (5/5), and the dungenous crab caesar salad (also 5/5). I would get both of those again. The bread, however, is kind of gross. Nothing special, even though the garlic sauce was really good.\n\nFor the main dish, my boyfriend and I split the Tono with risotto and the parpadelle with wild boar ragu. The tono with risotto was AMAZING. Perfectly seared tuna, and the risotto was so delicous. 5/5 for sure. The parpadelle was okay, but I wouldn't oder it again. A lot of sauce and not as much pasta. I had really wanted something simple like a pesto pasta but they didn't have that. I'd give that a 3/5.\n\nDessert- My dad got the tiramusi which was good, and the rest of us split the chocolate cake, which was really good and creamy. It came with hazelnut ice cream. 5/5 dessert.\n\nOverall- It was really good, but super pricey. It was $230 for dinner for 5 people with no drinks. We brought our own bottle of wine and our waiter was super nice and did not charge us a corkage fee (normally $30). I would still come here again, for a fancy date night.", "author": "Jenna G."}

What was absolutely unacceptable was  we always felt that we were rushed to make decisions from the menu selection, then we were rushed to finish our food, and check was brought very fast. We decided to treat one of the member of our party and asked her to pay less plus we will leave the cash tips. When the Italian guy saw her not leaving the tips he almost questioned that but we outpaced him on the spot and explained. You dont ask for tips period.

So we ordered the burrata instead, and it was delicious. We also split an order of the short rib ravioli, and it was over-the-top wonderful. Cooked perfectly with a filling that was rich and meaty, and that sauce... that sauce you could maybe just have as a soup it was that good.\n\nWe finished with profiteroles that were just fine. The caramel and chocolate sauces they came with were tasty, but the pastry was tough and the custard filling was nearly flavorless. \n\nBottom line, I wanted to love this place, but I just didn't. They are not especially expensive, especially for San Francisco, but it still cost us nearly $100 by the time we finished with a glass of wine each.

Her hubby also got the cutlet.\n\nWe all started with the Caesar salad with shredded Dungeness crab meat.  The romaine was fresh.  \n\nWhen we went to order our desserts, he literally took my friend's menu out of her hands as she was verbalizing her selection to him.

I have had so many great memories here it is hard to recount: first date with my wife, birthdays, friends' birthdays, work celebrations, and now my kids ask to go to Capannina for their birthdays! Michele, the owner is a class act. He is so warm and welcoming that it sets the tone from the moment you enter the restaurant. And the wait staff follows suit, offering attentive, yet not overly fussy, warm service.  The food is amazing. In my opinion the best Italian in SF. \n\nFavorites:\n\nAppetizers; the Grilled Octopus, Squid Ink Risotto, Ceasar Salad, Beef Carpaccio, and Burrata. \n\nMain dishes; Tortelloni filled with Short Ribs, Ravioli, Chicken, and the Short Ribs. \n\nDesserts (if you still have room left!); Profiteroles, Tiramisu, and Gelato.\n\nI highly recommend the Italian wines as they go better with the food. Even if you're not sure how to navigate an Italian wine list ask the waiter for their recommendations based on your dishes of choice. \n\nOverall a truly amazing and authentic Italian neighborhood restaurant experience that is sure to leave you wanting to come back again and again!", "author": "David G."}

Taking off one star for service: we felt rushed by our waiter - our appetizer plates were removed although some of us were still finishing up. Our request for a bread refill seemed to be a burden for the waiter. . . now on to the good stuff:\n\nThe complimentary bread and pesto was a delicious start to the meal. I kind of wish that the bread had been served warm, but it was still delightfully chewy and buttery. \nWe split two appetizers between four people: the squid-ink risotto and the lobster salad. Portions were excellent. The squid ink risotto was rich and complemented perfectly by the lobster bisque and sweet scallops. The lobster salad came with a whole lobster tail. Some of the best lobster I've had. It was paired with avocado, prosciutto, and a bed of arugula. Usually, I'm not such a huge fan of arugula, but the dressing was so delightful that I didn't mind it. \n\nI got the homemade prime rib tortellini - hands down, mouth open, 5 stars. Served with a delicious marsala sauce; I would have mopped it all up with the bread if I had had room at the end. Very generous portion, which was great because I could not get enough of the chewy pasta with the cheesy meat filling. The fried garlic pieces were a great touch. Best tortellini I've ever had. \n\nI also tried the gnocchi with crab meat. Served in a wonderful cream sauce, although the dish was not as dynamic as the tortellini. Did not try the ravioli, but I did observe that there were only four pieces. The cioppino was also good. Flavorful broth. It seemed to be heavy on the calamari and lacking on the lobster and fancier fish. Overall, I wish the food had been served a bit warmer. Still a fantastic dinner - highly recommended!", "author": "Melissa G."}

Got to squeeze into those seats.  So wear tight clothes.  \n\nOverall I think the restaurant has a good vibe but the food is not that great.  The 4 dishes I had was a little disappointing.  Even with simple ingredients,  chefs can make some amazing tasting dishes.  But not here.  Simple ingredients.  Mediocre taste and high prices.  \n\nSERVICE: EXCELLENT!! this is what service should be like attentive but not overwhelming. They knew I wasn't happy with the food and was still very attentive and tried to make it right, but it's not their fault that the food isn't right. Our waiter even asked if I wanted to pack the ragu I sent back, which was so nice that he didn't want food to be wasted. I declined since I really don't like soggy pasta, but its nice that he offered. \n\nFOOD\n\n(Squid Ink Risotto)- good.  The risotto is creamy but the squid ink flavor wasn't there.  The scallop on top cooked just right,  Seared on the outside and still fleshy inside. But perhaps the scallop was not that fresh and  maybe frozen, because I didn't taste the fresh umami flavor of the seafood. \n\n(Wild Boar Ragu) - I had to send it back.  The pasta was hand made but there was no bite to it.  It is overcooked and just stuck together in a pile.  The pasta broke when I tried picking it up with the fork.  The ragu was eh,  not special in anyway. Tasted like red sauce from a can with a gamey meat. There was no other garlic or herbs to add dimension to the dish.. \n\n(Rack of Lamb) delicious... Cooked to medium rare, the tender meat was so pleasing to the mouth and the sauce really made the lamb shine out. But there was nothing on the plate but a few chop and a few cuts of asparagus for $32 \n\n(Veal with Risotto and lemon caper cream sauce) normally I would love this sauce but it was too lemony and was overpowering to the delicate taste of the veal. The flavors didn't come together and the three things on the plate didn't speak to me at all. The veal was served in 4 thin slices 1 cm thick, 2 inch in diameter. Not much to eat there. The risotto was bland with nothing but cream. The spinach sadly was the only thing that lived up to expectation. I thought this was the worst dish. And for $26 I don't think so!", "author": "Helen L."}

We called in on a Saturday and they were very full, but they said if it was outdoor seating and we could make it in a half-hour they could get us a table. So we made our way over. Surprisingly, the outdoor seating was not very cold and we sat next to this adorable older couple who told us they'd been coming here for years and they recommended the Veal Scallopine. We ended up ordering: \n\n- The Squid-ink Risotto with scallops and lobster bisque. \n- Veal Scallopine\n- Rack of Lamb\n- Gnocchi al gorgonzola \n\nIt was all amazing and authentic too. The Italian owner came out a few times to check on the tables and make sure everything was alright: An A+ Dining experience. \n\nBut then... the second time I went there was for Mother's Day. I wanted to take my family there, so I called to make a reservation 3-4 weeks in advance. They called me to confirm my reservation a couple of hours in advance on the same day!!! They scared me when they left a message on my voicemail. But that ended up being okay. We arrive at the restaurant, and we get this awkward middle table. I mean, yeah... it's still a table, but it's in a weird spot and the waiters kept having to dive in and out of the walkway to serve us. Very uncomfortable, but that's okay, I know everything here is good! \n\nSo we're browsing the wine list and I'm not sure what to get, but I know my mom likes Chianti with Italian food. So I ask the waiter for a recommendation. I specifically say, \"I'm wondering if you have any suggestions for a Chianti.\" And he proceeds to say, \"This Sangiovese is amazing. Great flavor, good price. You won't regret it. Try it. If you don't like it we'll change it.\" So we get the wine, my mom doesn't like it. But it isn't like it's not really drinkable and we feel bad, so we keep it. \n\nThen for the food, we pretty much order the same things as the time before, I ordered the rack of lamb cooked medium-rare. Once again, not sure if the waiter is really listening...\n\nGuess what came out? Rack of Lamb, well-done. Noooooooo! I usually don't like complaining at restaurants. But I had to send it back. It was not what I ordered. It took another 25 minutes or so to get the new rack of lamb. It was beautifully pink on the inside and every bit as delicious as before. But I can't say the second dining experience was as good. At the end of our meal, the waiter brought us a free Tiramisu (I think he felt bad). \n\nI just hope that next time I go there I get a different waiter. I don't think this guy and I work well together.\n\nLong story short: Food, gooooood. This one particular waiter, nope. The end.", "author": "Manami K."}

I long for the day that I can buy a truck and then use it to carry lumber for the cabin I am building with my bare hands deep in the mountains, where the only music that can heard for miles around is the wind whipping through the tops of the mighty oaks with which I am surrounded, trusting nothing but my instincts and the hammer that hangs lazily from my toolbelt, and spending the nights staring directly into the heart of the fire that nurtures my body and my soul, coming to terms my own insignificance in the face of the gaping, craven maw of an uncaring universe.  \n\nI am, for all intents and purposes, a meathead.  \n\nSo when I take  a date to an upscale, authentic Italian restaurant like this, I'm pretending that I'm something I'm not.

Admittedly, we've had some very subpar experiences with a couple other Marina Italian restaurants with four stars, so I think this was on the back of our radar.  We decided on a whim last night to try it out, and this was right up there as probably the best strictly traditional Italian meal we've had in the city.\n\nTo start with, we had the squid ink risotto with scallop.  The scallop was seasoned and cooked perfectly, I am not usually a scallop fan but this is a can't miss.  The risotto was immensely flavorful and it was really a perfect dish for us.\n\nWe each had our own pasta.  My wife had the gnocchi with crab and lobster, which had a cheese based sauce with truffle salt.  I am not huge on truffle flavor so it wasn't my favorite, but based on the general flavor profile alone.  My wife devoured it and was in heaven the entire time.  If you like truffle, this is a must get.\n\nI, on the other hand, had the pappardelle with wild boar ragu.  This was insane.  The depth of flavor was phenomenal, and I enjoyed every bite.\n\nWe finished with the warm chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream, which was absolutely sublime.  We also had a very reasonable and very excellent $20 half bottle of Zinfandel, and we found their half bottle options to be well priced and a great range.\n\nTo make things better, from 5:00-6:00 they have a fantastic prix fixe deal that includes the majority of what we ordered, if not all of it (I know for a fact both pastas and the dessert) for TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS.

He was attentive without being annoying or intrusive, provided a small-but-not-obnoxious joke every time he came to check on us, and our courses were spaced out perfectly. We started with the arugula, prosciutto and mozzarella antipasti, which was delicious, then shared a lobster ravioli and linguine carbonara (with black truffle shavings) for our main course, and finished off with a tiramisu. We savored every bite and loved every moment. We also shared a moderately priced bottle of wine, and weren't rushed in the slightest, allowed to enjoy our romantic evening together.\n\nI don't write many reviews, and I feel that a lot of people are only compelled to leave feedback when they've had a bad experience, but we had such a perfect evening at Capannina that I had to recommend it to others. Please patronize this lovely little restaurant if you're craving Italian!", "author": "Chris R."}

The service was nice and the server we had was Italian so his accent gave made it cool I guess :) The restaurant itself is small but offers a very intimate setting. I ordered the Buffalo Mozzarella with Prosciutto, Roasted Red Peppers and Arugola Insalata to start my meal and it was delicious. So simple, yet so good! For my main course, I chose the risotto (cliche i know) and I was disappointed. This is why I am giving this place 3 stars. The risotto was boring and bland. I could barely taste all the flavors, it was just a big plate of salty rice and mushrooms. The dessert I shared with my friend that night was the Profiteroles with a vanilla cream filling and caramel and chocolat sauce. Basically it was some pate a choux, very well done and very well presented. Once again, simple but delicious. \n\nI would still recommend this place but be ready to walk a few blocks (San Franciso hills) because it is quite tough to find parking close to the restaurant.", "author": "Dina A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-30", "description": "Went here with a group of 7 for the boyfriend's birthday. We were looking to find a place with a prix fixe menu, but unfortunately, the one here was only for about an hour. Perhaps we'll come back some other time to see how that goes!\n\nFor a Thursday night, it was really, really loud, and quite crowded. Thankfully, we had phoned in for a reservation so we were seated right away. Unfortunately, our seat was right in the window, and the person at the corner of the table (which was me, of course, since I was the smallest and was the only one who could sit there without too much chance of getting hit, except I was nudged and tripped on a lot) was precarious in that there was barely any space for waiters to go through with their hot plates of food. Needless to say, I was in a difficult position. And also one in which I could not remove my coat, since every time the door was opened, I got the full blast of cold from outside. Not pleasant.\n\nThat aside, the food we ordered was quite fantastic. I love pasta, but not as much as the boyfriend. Italian food is the only thing he can actually say that I can't pronounce correctly. Our waiter was someone with a really fancy Italian accent, which was awesome. On our end of the table, the boyfriend and his best friend shared a plate of carpaccio. I'm not a fan of it, so I didn't eat it. The chorus of \"mmm's\" around the table made it seem excellent, though.\n\nTo be fair, all I wanted was dessert. I ordered gnocchi to start me off, which was okay. (Boyfriend said that it was a very well-made gnocchi. Since he is half-Italian, I am inclined to believe him.) What I really enjoyed was snagging some of his pasta, which was the stuff in wild boar ragu. Oh man, that was delicious. I really should have ordered what he had. Our friend also ordered tortelloni, and it was on that night that I learned that tortelloni is different from tortellini in that it is basically a more giant version of tortellini, and thus, a giant version of deliciousness. It's nice getting a small plate of food. This means you get to try a bit of everyone else's and realize, \"Damn, I should have gotten that.\"\n\nI waited impatiently for everyone to finish their meal. Finally, we got the dessert menus! Yes! This is what I was waiting for! The first three at my end of the table ordered five desserts. For the three of us. The waiter thought we were done. We were not. The next two ordered two more desserts. Again, the waiter thought we were done. We were not. And the last two ordered two more desserts. Yes. We had a total of eight desserts that covered our entire table. It was a glorious sight. It was so fantastic that the owner came by and looked thoroughly impressed. The waiter came back to check on us and kept saying, \"That's what I like to see...this is a dessert table. Yes.\" Oh yes. Yes it was, sir.\n\nDessert time was in full swing. We had two tiramisus, two chocolate cakes, two cannolis, profiteroles, a panna cotta, and a pistachio flan-like thing. Tiramisu? Excellent. Chocolate cakes? Oh my God. If I weren't allergic to raw egg, I would have inhaled it. I did have a bite and it was delicious and worth the mild pain. Cannolis? I had never had them before, and I wasn't fond of them, so I withhold judgment. Profiteroles? They were okay. Panna cotta? Never had this before either, but oh, it was lovely and light compared to the chocolate overload. The pistachio thing was something I figured I couldn't have since it looked too much like flan, but I did eat the gelato from it, which was delicious.\n\nAll in all, pretty dang delicious. I would go back for some desserts and coffee, and for the prix fixe. I'd just ask for a table that isn't totally in the way of the wait staff to avoid potential danger.", "author": "Robbin A."}

After we were seated, the waiter asked us if we wanted anything to drink other than water. I said none for me, and he grabbed our glasses, and walked away. Welp, my friend then had to order her glass of wine with her dinner, since she didn't get a chance to with drinks. Also, our waiter brought out bottled water, and I figured it was tap water, but when I saw two $7 charges on our bill for water, I realized it was bottled still water that they had charged us for, without mentioning it. \n\nSo we ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto for an appetizer - pretty good, roasted red peppers were a nice touch. We ate all the bread, and they brought us another without asking, which was nice because who wants to be the one to admit they want more bread?? The runners and bussers were very helpful and attentive. When we ordered our mains, our waiter was looking around the restaurant, not listening or even looking at us, and was very short in talking to us. I ordered the seared ahi tuna over prawn risotto, and the taste of the dish just did not come together for me. The tuna was okay, but the sloppy risotto tasted like instant risotto with overcooked tiny shrimps peppered in it. Friends got dungenouss caesar and short rib tortolloni - I didn't hear any raving reviews but I assume they were okay.\n\nOne friend got warm chocolate cake dessert - had a bite and it was tasty. When we got the check, we were getting our CCs out and the waiter grabbed immediately it while one friend was obviously still fishing hers out, like 10 seconds after he had dropped the check off. And when it came back and we wrote in our tip and got up to leave, the waiter came by, gave us a quick thanks, and grabbed the checks before we had walked away.

Even though there are plenty of good eats in the Marina, I believe this place is one of the better.  I mean, you could go to little Italy just around the way, but if you've already eaten your way through North Beach or want something with edge, this is a good pick.\n\nSCENE\nI like that the inside is intimate, but there is an outside dining option with heaters.  I also like that they ask about food allergies, especially when I was dining with a friend who is severely allergic to shellfish and almost forgot to mention it... easy to do when you don't plan to order shellfish.  On the other-hand, I love shellfish, and like that there is plenty of it throughout the menu.  \n\nWINE\nMy Chianti was delish and modestly priced, but the wine list was pretty sexy.\n\nFOOD\nWe wanted the caprese with the roasted peppers, but they ran out.  So we opted for the tri colore salad with pear, candied walnuts, gorgonzola and radicchio - good runner up and large enough to spit.\n\nSea Bass: generous slab served on-top of the best gnocchi I've had in SF.  Really, I don't love gnocchi, but I like it.  Here, I love the gnocchi, mostly because the texture is slightly firm, crispy, and buttery - but still very classic.  \n\nSalmon beurr blanc with artichoke - I liked the Sea Bass better, but this was also yummy. My friend really liked the artichoke side.\n\nDESSERT\nCreme Caramel w/ pistachio - I didn't really like this, because I don't generally like flan's texture.  However, the lace cookie and chocolate gelato were on point.  The biscotti was also fantastic.  In retrospect, I should have tried their panna cotta with a side of biscotti next time, because the biscotti was that good.  \n\nOverall, I was impressed with the menu because I felt it was authentic but contemporary - I liked the twists on old classics.  Also, I really liked that the scene wasn't so stuffy that I felt like I was on a date; but, I could come here for good food and have a romantic date.  \n\nNote: menu differed from that on the website.", "author": "Rayna A."}

I made a reservation for a Friday night, and it was PACKED.  We still had to wait 15 minutes for our table since they were cleaning it off.\n\n(You should all know that I'm so unbelievably stuffed right now as I'm writing this that I'm half lying on the couch with my eyes struggling to stay open)\n\nWe started off with the squid ink risotto, which is seriously probably the best thing I've eaten in a long, long time.  Savory, creamy, great risotto texture due to it being cooked to perfection.  Last damn meal on earth.  It was surrounded by a red sauce which tasted sort of like pizza sauce, and I didn't find that it was necessary for the risotto.\n\nI ordered the papardelle with mushroom and wild boar ragu.   Wide strips of pasta were coated with a chunky tomato sauce, and there were pieces of meat interspersed.  It was almost like a new take on meat sauce, which is pretty much the only type of sauce I'll eat with pasta.\n\nMy cousin decided on the black truffle linguini, and my aunt had the sand dab and truffles, both of which were on their seasonal truffle special menu.  The sand dabs were also freaking amazing; the fish was super delicate and tender, and the sauce wasn't overpowering or too thick.  I stayed away from my cousin's linguini, as it was in what looked like a creamy sauce, and I didn't want my lactardness to act up.\n\nThis place packs in a ton of tables, so if you're looking for somewhere to have an intimate conversation on a weekend evening, this probably isn't it.  It's loud.  And busy.  However, if you want major quality for dinner, along with attentive service, this is a completely solid pick.\n\nUnfortunately we were too full to want to glimpse at the dessert menu, but the good news is (at least for me), I live a few blocks away.

Then there was the guy behind the bar (only three stools, but you can also eat there).  \n\nBetween the two of us, we shared the special appetizer of the day, which was a soft-spun mozzarella over warm broccoli rabe, with chili flakes and garlic oil.  Unbelievable.  \n\nI moved onto the beet salad with almond-crusted goat cheese.  It was SO good.  Both gold and red beet medallions, and the plate decorated lightly with a yummy drizzle, smaller beet chunks, and almond slivers.  \n\nI finished with the seafood cioppino, probably the best I've ever had, which is saying alot for San Francisco.  The broth was thick, not like broth at all.  It was presented with a lobster on top, and when you removed his husk to get to the meat, there was ALL this other fish and shellfish waiting.  I just enjoyed the leftovers for breakfast, which has temporarily soothed my aching throat.\n\nThis place is fantastic.  And in such a wanna-be shi-shi neighborhood, it's unpretentious-ness is welcome and surprising.", "author": "Tamar D."}

It's a new item on their menu and JJ proclaimed it might be one of the best things he's eaten all year. The tortellini skin is sooo delicate and the short rib is mind blowingly flavorful. I don't want to overhype it... but lets just say with our party of 6, we ALL had buyer's remorse after we tasted JJ's dish. \n\nI had the wild boar parpadelle that everyone recommended, and it was delicious too, but paled in comparison to the tortellini. Appetizers were good, but I would say save room for the main dishes and dessert. The squid ink risotto is worth a try. \n\nSince we had a few sweet toothed folk to feed we had the luxury of sampling 4 different desserts. The tiramisu is pretty standard, pistacchio gelee was unique, and the custard profiteroles came with tasty dipping sauces. The star of the night was the hazelnut ice cream that came with the warm chocolate cake. Super delicious if you are a hazelnut fan!\n\nThe restaurant is quite small, and we had to wait about 20 min before our table was ready, but overall service was decent, and the owner even came out to say hi to us.", "author": "Christina T."}

My wife was able to locate this restaurant based on great reviews on yelp. This place is one of the nicest small Italian restaurants we have ever visited. It is compact and cozy and it helps if you can order quickly. However, we never did really feel rushed and the service was very pleasant. We split a Caesar salad and also enjoyed six oysters. Caesar salad came with fresh Dungeness crab was delicious. Our entr\u00e9es included a mixed seafood Grill with spinach risotto, and cioppino. Both were terrific and as good as we have ever had. The seafood in the cioppino was perfectly cooked and fresh, moist, far different from the leftover seafood that we have had at some other locations. There are some very nice wines available by the glass, mostly at a cost of $10 per glass, which we found unusually reasonable in San Francisco. In fact the pricing of this restaurant is a good deal compared to many of the premier restaurants whose food is not any better and whose prices are twice as high. Bravo!", "author": "Michael H."}

Friend #1 ordered Caesar Salad with Crab, Grilled Salmon, Tiramisu. Friend #2 ordered Zuppa del Giorno (asparagus soup), Pappardelle with Mushrooms & Wild Boar Ragu, Sorbetto.

It was near dinner time, and my folks told us not to worry, they'll take care of the kids, while we head out for dinner. \n\nCapannina has been on my list of bookmarks ever since I saw it featured in an episode of \"Check, Bay Area Please\" a few years back. We didn't have any reservations, but we figured may be able to be seated for if we arrived right when it opened. As we walked through the door, the waiter warmly greeted us, and let us choose where we wanted to be seated. It's a relatively, small, intimate restaurant, but still very comfortable. \n\nBetween 5-6PM, a 3 course prix fixe menu is offered with a choice of 3 starters, a choice of 4 main courses, and a choice of dessert from the menu. All for $25. \n\nMy wife chose to go with the prix fixe menu, but I chose to order off the menu. There were some items on the menu that wanted to try that wasn't on the prix fixe menu. \n\nHere's what we ordered (low light, pictures didn't come out as well): \n\n-Caesar Salad with Crab & Croutons (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HWWXRD3KWJRB-WBuXX9RKQ?select=W3QQjOgPHm1x5RlIuVT1xA): This was on the prix fixe menu. We were expecting a small-size salad with bits of crab. We were quite surprised when this arrived. A very nice sized salad, with topped with a generous amount of Dungeness crab. \n\n-Risotto Nero Con Capesante alla Venziana (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HWWXRD3KWJRB-WBuXX9RKQ?select=3gsJPPe-v5Ge7o8D7M9lHQ): Black Ink Risotto with Seared Scallops & Lobster Bisque. When I saw this on the menu, I had to order it. I love the bright colors of this dish contrasted with the blackness of the risotto. The scallops were nicely seared on the outside, and soft on the inside. The risotto was al dente, creamy, yet with a slight crunch with each bite. The taste was buttery, yet with a slight citrusy, tart taste. \n\n-Pesto Crusted Salmon with risotto and calamari (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HWWXRD3KWJRB-WBuXX9RKQ?select=-RQ2H6hPoauIPkBg18r0TQ): Also from the prix fixe menu. Again, a very generous serving. Salmon was cooked just right. \n\n-Puntine di Manzo Brasate al Vino Rosso (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HWWXRD3KWJRB-WBuXX9RKQ?select=_1QfwjnhVZDR342H9IfjxA): Braised Short Ribs with Mashed Potatoes in a Red Wine Sauce. A nice, thick cut of short ribs. Although a steak knife was given to me with this dish, I really didn't need it. The meat just fell off the bone, and can be cut with a fork. I liked the wine sauce. It was rich, and did not overwhelm the meat. \n\n-Warm Chocolate Cake, Hazelnut Ice Cream, and rum sauce (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HWWXRD3KWJRB-WBuXX9RKQ?select=2DRQ88uyLvWCOWHSXgyI_A): The warm chocolate in the middle of the cake oozes out as you cut it open. Perfect with the cool hazelnut ice cream and rum sauce. Got a lot of envious stares from the table next to us! \n\n-Cheese Course (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HWWXRD3KWJRB-WBuXX9RKQ?select=6EZnausDXggg9QwdPHrqbw) Single servings of 5 different cheeses: Robiola (goat's milk), Capretta (goat's milk), Blu Del Moncenisio (blue cheese, cow's milk), Pecorino Lucano (Sheep's milk), Scimudin (cow's milk). Accompanied by two slices of toasted bread, candied walnuts, caramel pistachios, and honey-soaked hazelnuts. \n\nAlthough there was only one main waiter, and two assistants/bussers, they were able to handle all the tables efficiently. The main waiter was very warm and friendly. He recognized and greeted the regular customers, without ignoring the new customers like us. \n\nWe had a nice time dining here, and chatting with the other diners next to us. \n\nWe'll will be back!", "author": "Steve L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-12", "description": "This was my first time at Capannina and let me just say that I was very excited about trying this place - not only have I heard wonderful things, but the menu looked fantastic and I'm always ready to eat my bodyweight in Italian food. With that being said, what a disappointment...\n\nAfter making a super reservation via opentable, about 30 minutes prior to our reservation, we were seated with ease...the owner (I'm presuming) handed us our menus and then walked off...good start so far. Scouring the menu, everything looked fantastic. They had a specialty menu with White and Black Truffle options being served - my favorite and I was super excited...so then we wait...and wait...and wait a little bit more. Our waiter finally comes over after about 10-15 minutes and bluntly asks \"did you decide what you want?\"\n\n\"...uhhh, ummm, nice to meet you too - what a great introduction you just made - sure we'll have a two glasses of pinot noir and 6...\"\n\n\"Oysters, got it\" - swiftly grabs our wine glasses and walks away. I exchange glances with my date like \"what just happened?\" \n\nMoving right along, we are served our wine and oysters - which were both fantastic. The champagne sauce for the oysters was light and the oysters were fresh. The wine complimented perfectly (I know - we didn't order white, but what can you do?). We finish our oysters and are waiting for the waiter to come back...and continue waiting....again...noticing a pattern with the service yet?\n\n\"Are you having entrees tonight?\"\n\n\"uhh yes, I'll have the cioppino...\"\n\n\"Cioppino, got it.\"\n\n\"and I'll have the linguine car...\"\n\n\"black or white truffle?\"\n\nAfter my response, swiftly grabs our menus and briskly walks off. At this point, the service is just so outright rude. We're both looking at each other like really? Are we about to spend $50 each to be treated like we're at an Olive Garden? \n\nThe food arrives in time and it looks fantastic. The cioppino has half a lobster sitting on it, which was gorgeous, tons of mixed seafood and is perfectly seasoned - not too spicy, but nice and hardy. As for the Linguine Carbonara with Black Truffle...fantastic! The sauce is just perfect and the truffle is not completely overpowering the plate. We are both enjoying our meals, but I also like a bit of spice so I wanted some red pepper flakes...so we waited....waited....waited for our server to stop by. Again, waiting. Yay! He finally showed up, we asked for red pepper flakes, and he shouts to the food runner to grab some....um okay, that was kinda weird.\n\nWe both finish our meals, thoroughly satisfied with the fantastic food that was served to us. As we're finishing up our meal, an older couple sits down to our left with their daughter...this is when the real kicker regarding the service comes into play. They are immediately greeted by the waiter, given a complete run-down of the wine menu - offering options best suited for certain dishes. After this, they are given an in depth explanation of the Specialty Menu, going into great detail about the Truffle being used...after placing their drink order - the waiter comes back to the table to serve up their drinks, also bringing the fancy jar that is currently storing the Truffle that was flown in from Italy to make up this Specialty Menu.  \n\nSee any service comparisons here? \n\nWhen this happened, I was extremely irritated - a wonderful meal was totally stained because of horrible service, which seemed to be rather specific to our table of two. Where was our in-depth explanation of your specials for the evening? Where was our explanation of your extensive wine list? How come we were not shown the specialty truffle encased in a fancy vase before making our ordering decision?\n\nIn this day and age, it's become obvious where certain restaurants excel and others fall short...SERVICE. \n\nThe food at Capannina is 5-star quality, but the service here completely takes away from the food and left a rancid taste in my mouth...\n\nCheers.", "author": "Sean R."}

It's located in a very cute area; we went around just before Christmas time and the whole street had lights strung up, so it was nice to walk down. \n\nI really liked the bread that was provided, along with the olive oil. For an appetizer, we had the black ink risotto with the seared scallops; it was a little sweet for my taste, but had a decent amount of scallops, which were cooked nicely. I had the seared ahi tuna over the spicy prawn risotto and my boyfriend had the mixed seafood grill. Both were good sized dishes for the price and yummy; the presentation was also very nice. For dessert we ordered the cannoli and the creme brulee. We personally did not like the cannoli very much; it was bland and the texture didn't seem right. The creme brulee was also so-so. \n\nFour stars because the service started off a little spotty. We had a reservation, but still had to wait about 15 minutes for our table. Once we were inside, we had to ask two separate waiters for water before we finally got some. However, they were quite busy, so I can forgive them for that because the service afterwards was great. The couple at the table next to us had ordered a bottle of wine, but only drank half of it. The waiter noticed my boyfriend eying it after they left, so he offered it to us free of charge since they couldn't re-serve it anyway (don't worry, we had also ordered our own glasses of wine beforehand!). The service was very attentive during our meal and the waiters very friendly and warm. \n\nThe place has the atmosphere of a cozy, cute Italian restaurant and comes with good portioned, delicious dishes. I would highly recommend it for someone is a little more patient and forgiving about the service when it is a little more crowded.

Perhaps slightly more 'classical' in style than A-16 or Flour & Water (but comparable in price and quality), and more focused on the southern Italian cuisine with lots of Seafood.  I have visited this restaurant a number of times over the years (its just a 10 minute walk from my apartment) and I have had only great experiences. \n\nOn our most recent visit, my friends and I started with salads (go for the mixed greens with goat cheese and walnuts) and then dined on several items from their summer truffle menu- including a carpaccio with shaved truffles, and a veal scaloppine with risotto and shaved truffles.  Truffle in the English language of course means = $$$, so this kicked the average meal price up a bit from what I usually encounter here, but it was well worth it and everything was superb as always.  Service was great, and we finished off with some delicious desserts, including their molten chocolate cake (like a French-style chocolate fondant cake).\n\nIt was Friday night, and the place was packed and patrons were bubbling around waiting to be seated.  We had a leisurely meal, consumed a couple of bottles of wine, but I could tell the staff was ready to re-use our table promptly.  Off the top of my head, I can only think of two Italian restaurants that I can say are truly 'better' than Capannina in SF- one is the original Delfina (NOT the pizza places!) and the other is Acquerello, which I may just label as my 'top' restaurant in SF (right there at or above Gary Danko).

The inside is really nice too. It's got a great ambiance.

It was amazingly delicious. The risotto wasn't really spicy, but the sauce was good and the flavor was great. The Seared Tuna was peppered and it was SO good. My boyfriend ordered the salmon which was cooked really well. His parents got the Clam Linguini and loved it.

There was no host, and it seemed unclear as to who exactly was in charge. Eventually, I was able to get the attention of someone but was told we would have to wait 20 minutes. I completely understand this, but there was absolutely no need for them to be rude about it and sneering.\n\nOverall, I found the food to be decent, but it was not spectacular. The half bottle of wine we ordered was also very reasonable. However, considering the prices, I was hoping for better. \n\nNot to rant again, but the service at our table was also very iffy at best. The server was around for our appetizers, but suddenly vanished in the middle of our meal and only came back at the very end with the cheque. In between, one of the other servers ended up taking our dessert order. \n\nCapannina seems like a reasonable restaurant and perhaps we just picked an off night. However, from my experience here, they need to do a lot to improve their customer service. The customers should always come first, and I felt that they really dropped the ball on what I consider to be the most important aspect of eating at a restaurant.", "author": "Hikaru N."}

Listed as veal scallopini, it was closer to veal piccata.  Four pieces of veal with spinach and a creamy parmesan risotto, I would recommend it.  Two others had rack of lamb.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, but one dish contained three pieces the other had four.  The waiter said it was because the three slices were thicker than the four pieces.  Weird but true explanation but why wouldn't the presentation be consistent to the same table?\n\nWe had Caesar salads with crab, the only way the Caesar was offered.  There wasn't enough crab or salad for the $16.00 price, they should get rid of the crab and provide a better priced salad.\n\nThe service was uneven.  If a waiter with an Italian accent excites you then you'd like our waiter.  But he didn't provide good service, nearby tables that were occupied after we were seated had drink and food orders taken before ours.  We had to flag him down to place our orders.  Once orders were placed the service was good and he became more congenial.  But, at the end of the meal our desserts were brought to us and finished before we got coffee, and we had to ask twice for the coffee after we ordered it.\n\nBut the real annoyance was the noise.  Sort of like trying to have an intimate dinner at AT&T park with thousands of people around you.  We really had to raise our voice to have a conversation with our table mates.  Seemed like they just crammed too many tables in the room which resulted in excessive noise.  Sound insulation on the walls and ceiling would help.\n\nBottom line is the food was very good, but take your chances with rest of your dining experience.", "author": "Jay B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-31", "description": "Rating was rounded up to adjust for a few factors outside of their control: we were in a rush and asked for our food quickly and our obnoxious neighboring table.\n\nThis restaurant is a \"fancy food\" place for special occasions.  Parking was a challenge on a Saturday evening, but we did luck out and get a street spot a few blocks away.  We had reservations, but still needed to wait about 15 minutes.  But we were a few minutes late because we were searching for parking.\n\nThe place is small, loud, and crowded with special occasion diners.  People celebrating birthdays, dinner before the prom, etc.  The group next to us was drunk and rowdy.  One table brought their lap dog with them.  It was well behaved, though.  Interesting.\n\nOkay, onto the food.  I believe the appetizer was Carpaccio di Tonno, a tuna carpaccio.  This was fabulous!  Fish was fresh and the capers were a nice touch.  We also were given a container of bread with an olive tapenade, but the bread was COLD.  Argh!  I'm a bread fanatic and was kind of (to say the least) disgruntled by this.  My favorite fancy food restaurant bakes bread fresh twice a day!\n\nWe got the famous Pappardelle with Mushrooms & Wild Boar Ragu.  They served it to us in two separate plates, which was a very nice touch.  The fresh pasta was the right texture and cooked perfectly.  It stayed warm until the bottom.  I think they heated their plates too, which is awesome.  Temperature makes such a difference when eating pasta!  The sauce was delicious, but not jaw-droppingly spectacular.  We couldn't tell the tiny pieces of ground meat were boar...is there a supposed to be a difference in flavor?  We couldn't detect it.  It could have been lean ground beef.\n\nWe also got one of their specials: veal shank (ossobuco).  It was plated with polenta.  Pretty good, but it could have been more tender.  I'm being very nit picky here!  The thicker areas didn't seem to have absorbed the flavor of the broth.  It might have been rushed, since they were so busy and we had a time constraint.  BF was unhappy that there wasn't any marrow.  The pieces we got had rather narrow bones.  My palate isn't used to those earthy flavors, so I was cool with that!\n\nDesserts looks marvelous, but we didn't get any because we were in a rush.  Service was friendly and efficient, despite the crowd.  I'd say it was about average.  Portion sizes are typical of \"fancy food\" places - don't be expectin' no Olive Garden here!  If you're a large guy, eat beforehand!\n\nWould I go back here?  Maybe I'd try a weeknight evening for better service, ambiance, and slow-cooked food.", "author": "Kari C."}

I usually try to avoid the Marina/Cow Hollow area due to the crowds and high priced restaurants, but I must say Capannina is a must try! My husband easily made a reservation for 4 on a weeknight and we got seated right away. The menu has a great selection of seasonal options. The prices are not cheap, but definitely reasonable.\n\nI had the seared rare ahi tuna over spicy prawn risotto. This dish was amazing. The ahi and prawns were super fresh. The flavors are so fanstastic on this dish that it's making me dream about it as I write this. I actually debated over getting the braised short rib tortellini which sounded yummy, but decided on the ahi tuna instead. One of our guests had the ravioli and the other the mixed seafood meal which they both gave thumbs up. Our dishes were completely wiped clean.\n\nI am not sure why there are so many reviews on the service, maybe it was an off day or maybe people went on an extremely busy night, but our service was great. The waitstaff was attentive in refilling our water glasses and checked in on us frequently. The owner was super friendly and you can tell he takes pride in his restaurant.

The owner really started the night off right for us - when we couldn't find parking, he removed his a-frame sign from the spot in front of the restaurant and let us park there. \n\nWe started the night off with the Carlene Malvolti Prosecco, which I would recommend under any circumstances. It's a little bit sweeter and a little less dry than most proseccos, but we loved it. When we finished the prosecco, the owner was able to recommend another great bottle of red to go with our main courses. \n\nFrom the mussels to the risotto to the steak and everything in between, everything that we ordered was excellent. The menu items were thoughtfully created, and everything was just completely delicious and satisfying. \n\nGiven the excellent service throughout and how wonderful all of the food was, I would recommend this restaurant again in a heartbeat. Great for a date or a night out with a small group of friends, but I wouldn't bring a large group here just because it's so small.

Prior to this week, I'd eaten in the Marina a total of ONE time.  In my 24 years.  And this experience was by no means a bad one.  I am surprised every week by you, SF. \n\nAnyway, I saw that there was a $25 prix fixe option daily from 5-6pm, and you know how I am with the cheap dealios.  I AM ALL OVER THAT!  \n\nSo, on Saturday at 5:50pm, Lindsay M. and I hit up Capaninna for a nice, long, lazy dinner, with a perfect outdoor table on Union Street, both of us drenched in evening sunlight, rays splashing all over our faces, table, and food, bottle of chardonnay for extra warmth, feeling wonderful and lovely. \n\nI ordered a baby greens salad, the salmon, and finished with the sorbet and gelato.  My baby greens salad was simple, with some parmesan shavings and tasteless walnuts. Overall, it was on the bland side, and the vinaigrette was VERY light.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you're in a light food mood, which I was on that particular night.  The salmon was also quite bland and a bit overcooked.  This, I also would not recommend.  Thank goodness for dessert, which saved the meal and ended it on a very high note.  My trio of gelato and sorbet - vanilla, chocolate, and raspberry - was amazing.  The portion was generous, and each scoop came in these cute edible cookie-thins-baskets (sorry, I don't know what else to call them).  Rich and delicious.   \n\nMinus one star because:\n\n1) They were very direct about asking us to leave after we'd finished our dinner.  I'm not the kind of person who really cares THAT much about service, but I think it's kind of rude when restaurants overtly rush you like that.  \n\n2) We brought our own bottle of chardonnay and they charged $20 for corkage.  Knowing this, if you do decide to bring your own bottle, you should bring an expensive-ass bottle of wine to make the corkage worth it. \n\nSo, overall, the food was average, save for dessert.  However, what makes me round this review up to four stars is the fantastic ambiance.  You can dress up or dress down; it's cozy and casual, yet classy.  On a sunny evening, it's quaint, relaxing, and gives you that \"Oh man, life is sweeeet\" feeling.  Oh, and $25 is pretty damn sweet too.", "author": "Vivian C."}

The decor inside was warm and inviting.  The food felt pretty authentic.  Service was attentive... and complete with Italian accent.\n\nRisotto Nero - flavors were complex... with the squid ink, the nicely seared scallop and the rich lobster bisque.  The rice had a good texture.  I could eat this all day long.\n\nSince I was on a seafood kick, I decided to have the seared tuna with spicy prawn risotto (yes, double-downed on the risotto ).  This risotto was also great, and the dish was tasty.  The tuna was very lightly seared, just how I like it.  One small complaint was the dish did started to get boring after the around the fifth slice of tuna because every bite felt like it was just more of the same - though still tasty!  \n\nFor dessert, we were already full, but decided to have the tiramisu and the canoli with espresso cream.  I particularly liked the canoli because the shell was very crispy and the cream was rich but light.

Tonight however was a huge disappointment. The regular gnocchi on the menu was $18 and involved crab and lobster however because i remember their gorgonzola sauce being so good, I requested it with gorgonzola and asparagus.  The plate was delivered to my table w/out an offer for parmesan cheese or fresh ground pepper and the gnocchi was too firm (not melt in your mouth texture like I remember it to be) and the gorgonzola sauce was liquid. Not creamy sauce with chunks of gorgonzola like I remember it yo be long ago.  The dessert was a caramel pistachio custard-like dish that was heavy on the artificial pistachio flavoring. (Kind of tastes like amaretto actually).

My husband had the winning main, the Seafood Grill. That was really yummy! However, my Pappardelle with Wild Boar Ragu was boring. The pasta was cooked for too long, and was very mushy.

Finally, when we were seated, we were left alone again for another long period of time. They were busy, true, but the number of staff should be scheduled in such as way as to provide good service to everyone on popular nights. Our waiter spoke about 3 words to us the entire evening.

We had the braised short ribs and a chicken dish and it was to die for. The ribs melted in your mouth and the chicken was very moist.\n\nDessert was so so. We ordered the warm chocolate cake and our entire experience would've been amazing if not for what we discovered a few days after.\n\nMy boyfriend, being so savvy with his finances was doing his routine check of his accounts. Shockingly, we noticed that the waiters added on more money to the tip that we left! Our bill was around $65 and change and he left them a tip of around $15 making the total bill around $80 and change. When he looked at his CC statement, the total came to a rounded $100 making the tip around $35 -- almost 50% of our bill! OUTRAGEOUS.  We knew that we definitely did not leave that much of a tip because we never calculate so that the total bill would be an even rounded out amount. \n\nLuckily, Amex deals with that sort of shit because we did not want to have anything to do with such a dishonest establishment.

After calling about 8 places that were totally booked, we ended up snagging a 9pm reservation at Capannina- booked by the most jovial and uh-mazing Italian man ever. (I would make a reservation again, JUST so I could talk to him!)\n\nI had a great feeling about this place from the get-go, and was pleasantly surprised that it lived up to my high expectations.  We did have to wait for a good 20-25 minutes once we got there since the place was completely packed (and looked like it had been quite overbooked), hence the 4, not 5-star rating.\n\nTo START:\n- I had the black ink risotto with a seared scallop- the risotto was cooked perfectly, not too hard, not too soft, creamy, rich and delicious. \n\n- My bf's dad had the buffalo mozz- which was melt in your mouth scrumptious \n\n- The BF had mussels in pepperoncini sauce + his stepmom had it in pesto sauce - the plate was overflowing with mussels and if I had to choose, I'd go with the pesto since the pepperoncini had a slight metallic flavor to it.\n\nENTREES:\n- Seared Tuna over prawn risotto - this place knows how to make a great risotto!!  The tuna was perfectly cooked and had a great peppery/spicy crust on it.\n\n- Veal Scallopini- it was good, but nothing special.. and in comparison to the other dishes, seemed a little small.\n\n- Seared Sea bass over cauliflower puree w/ truffle peas - Oh. Em. Gee. nuff said.\n\nDESSERT:\n- Panna cotta - very tasty, great consistency + great to share\n- Mini cannoli's - the filling was broken and I prefer the ones I get from Whole Foods... not worth it (but the sauce I could have eaten like soup)\n\nOverall, can't wait to go back, but wish it was a little bigger :)", "author": "Alyssa S."}

Don't think pastas, tomato sauces, and dishes with no meat.. NO.  Capannina is not this place.  This place will satisfy even the biggest of carnivores.  MUST HAVE: Braised Short Ribs.  This dish is a massive slab of the most tender, fall-off-the-bone, juiciest, flavorful piece of meat you'll ever have. Hands down.  I know.. it's not the most Italian of dishes, but trust me on this one.\n\nThe atmosphere is intimate.  It's not a big place, so you're sitting pretty close to the people around you.  The service is bar none!!  Everyone has that authentic Italian accent which just adds to your experience.  And they're all extremely attentive.  They were so nice that they even offered to have our friends (arriving late) park right in front of the restaurant where valet parks.\n\nThere were 8 people in our group.  We brought  our own bottles of wine which they will uncork for $20 a bottle.  Might sound pricey, but the bottles they offer are roughly around the same price (some more).\n\nApps:\n-Squid ink risotto with scallop: YUM\n-Carpaccio: YUM (we got 2 orders)\n-Mussels: Excellent\n-Calamari: Not the crispy/fried kinds... YUM\n-Oysters: Double YUM\n-Buffalo Mozzarella: YUM\n\nEntrees:\n-Braised Short Ribs: EXTREME YUM!!\n-Squid Ink pasta: Excellent\n-Seared Ahi Tuna: Pretty Good\n-Bacon Wrapped Scallops with Lobster Ravioli: Didn't get to try, but it was my second choice.\n-Gniocchi: Highly recommend\n-Lobster and Risotto: Big portion with big YUM\n\nTake it from me.. i'm not the biggest fan of Italian cuisine, but again, this place has definitely turned me into a big believer.", "author": "Richie C."}

We were seated rather promptly and had a very friendly waiter who was Italian charm to the max. \n\nWe ordered a half bottle of Chianti, 2 different pappardelle (the wild boar, of course, and the squid ink with crab meat), the special sea bream and the rack of lamb. \n\nIf you are a diligent Yelp reader, you would know that the wild boar pappardelle is a must try here. The ragout was hearty and well balanced with the pappardelle. The squid ink was good, but needed a little more sauce to counterbalance the pappardelle's texture. When you had a bite with a little more crabmeat, then it was heavenly. \n\nOnto the mains: The sea bream was served with roasted potatoes and asparagus but my friend who doesn't eat any greens opted out of the asparagus (sigh). The fish was perfectly cooked and all the bones had been removed. The flavor was delicate and the texture was perfect. If there is a gold standard of cooking fish, this would be it. The rack of lamb was a generous portion of 6 racks. The garlic and rosemary were present but not overpowering. I was craving rack of lamb and it satisfied. But the Truffled Mashed Potatoes! I'm not a mashed potatoes fan. Years of boarding school mashed potatoes have scared me away from the dish but I may become a believer after the truffled mashed potatoes from Capannina. Smooth and fluffy pillows of potatoes with hints of truffle here and there, it would be every potato's dream to be included in this dish. \n\nI took one star off because the restaurant was so loud I could barely hear myself think, let alone my dining companion. If you are looking for intimate and romantic, I would not go hear because sweet nothings are not so sweet when you have to shout it over everyone in the restaurant.", "author": "Karen K."}

My wine and water glasses were never empty. \n\nThe food was perfect. Not one person in our party was disappointed. Personally, I had the fried squash blossoms stuffed with fresh mozzarella.

They were tender and delicious. I ate a little bit off of everyone's plate and all of the dishes were incredible. Especially the Sand Dabs with black truffles. YUM.\n\nNow, don't hold back on dessert because their molten chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream had most of my party agreeing it was the best they had ever had.

There must have been some kind of drug in the pesto because I couldn't stop eating it!  Our meal only got better after our entrees arrived.

Because I went with my family, I got to taste a lot of dishes, as we did appetizers, salads,mains, and dessert so we got a great sampling. Holy shit- the short rib tortellinis were a revelation. I don't know if I will ever order anything other than this when I return-  it was so incredible. Deep, meaty, tender, rich filling, so light and perfectly al dente outside, topped with a lick your plate clean kind of sauce.... Wow. Also the octopus appetizer was divine.  The food was so good- my only negative comment is they had a seasonal menu with truffles and I ordered paperdelle with black truffles. I thought it would be simple, elegant, and perfect... But it was just really bland. Underseasoned. Gummy. Not good. I made everyone else taste it and we all agreed it was, at best, \"meh\" . It was a bummer to pay an additional $35 for shaved truffles to have  such lackluster pasta -- especially since everyone else's plates were out of this world delicious.  (Short ribs, ahi tuna, Squid ink risotto, lobster salad....) My husband told the waiter I didn't like it (I was too embarrassed!) and our polite, professional waiter told me to select a new dish and whisked away the offending plate without raising an eyebrow. (Or charging a penny). Within minutes I had the substituted short rib tortellini in front of me and I could care less about the original misstep.

We were pleasantly surprised with the quiet and inviting dining room.  In looking over the menu I found that there was a very complete menu of Italian food with very decent prices, especially for San Francisco.  The dinner salad was $8 and the main courses ranged $20 - $30.  Desserts were also $8.\n\nThe prix fixe menu caught our eye and we both ended up ordering it.  It included a Caesar salad with crab.  That salad was delicious with a large amount of shredded Parmesan and a generous amount of crab.  I have never had a Caesar with crab before and was very pleased with that combination of flavors.\n\nWe both ordered the salmon main course.  It came with a small amount of broccoli and a piece of salmon that was cooked perfectly.  It was done through but unusually tender and had some sauces drizzled on the plate.  I'm not sure what they were but they certainly enhanced the flavor of the salmon.\n\nFor dessert my wife ordered the Tiramisu and I ordered the warm chocolate cake.  The Tiramisu was very good and came with thin pieces of white chocolate on each side.  The cake had a warm chocolate  sauce poured over it and came with some ice cream served in a pastry shell.  I highly recommend that cake for chocolate lovers.\n\nThe presentation of all three courses was excellent.  Surprisingly, that prix fixe menu only cost $25 but is available only between 5 and 6 PM.  Our business in the city that day caused us to miss lunch and ended on Union St about 5:30 so we were in a mood for an early dinner and happy enough to delay our drive home until after the evening commute. \n\nThe waiter was very attentive without being intrusive.  His demeanor was upbeat and enthusiastic.  He seemed to be pleased to see us pleased.  He made us feel very welcome and cared for.  In all, I would say that Capannina is a gem to be enjoyed any day for dinner and I am looking forward to going back and sampling some of their other dishes.

I don't spend much time in this neighborhood and hadn't heard much about it, but was excited to try a new Italian place. My friend adores Capannina, and it didn't disappoint.\n\nWe dined at 6 p.m. on a Sunday and just barely missed the \"early bird special\" which is really just their fixed price special that runs from 5-6 p.m. Quite a steal - $25 for three courses, though you have a limited number of choices for the starters and main courses.\n\nWe started with the warm beet salad (with goat cheese crostini), the stuffed calamari and the crab cake. My favorite was the crab cake which isn't a traditional, flat crab cake that I'm used to eating; this crab cake was taller, bigger and more like a cake. The crab cake was yummy and went well with the lobster sauce that it came on. Even though I'm not a big fan of calamari, the stuffed calamari were also tasty; the potato and crab stuffing was great, and the bread on the bottom of the plate complemented the calamari well. \n\nChoosing a main dish was challenging because so many of them were appealing, but I finally decided on the pappardelle with mushrooms and wild boar ragu. So delicious and perfect proportion of ragu to pasta, and the ragu didn't seem to heavy or rich.\n\nThe restaurant is pretty small - only about 12-15 tables with a few seats at the bar. It's on the quiet side, so it's a great place to catch up with a couple of friends.

Very busy and completely full on a Saturday night, we were early for our reservation and since there was no waiting room to speak of in the restaurant, wandered the street  (I think this is why Starbucks was invented, for there to be a place for people to loiter while they wait for a table) for a few minutes until they could seat our party of 4.\n\nThe space is small, intimate bordering on jampacked with waiters scrambling every which way at breakneck speed. As busy as it was, our waiter was still pleasant as punch (his accent was delightful, hope it wasn't just for show) and accommodating when we needed a few minutes to peruse our options. \n\nEnded up with the burrata with broccoli and squid ink risotto for starters. I am usually not much of a risotto person, find it too wet, too much like oatmeal but this was totally different, less wet and formed into a tight mound just oozing squid ink yumminess. The burrata and broccoli was just as amazing, incredibly fresh cheese and broccoli not the least bit bitter. \n\nFor dinner I had penne all' aribiatta (my standard in Italian joints) and it was too die for, perfectly spicy, perfectly garlicky, perfectly tomatoey everything just living together in harmony in my mouth. Honestly can't recall what the rest of the table ordered, was too busy with my own food.\n\nAfter such outstanding first and second courses, I had to get dessert even though I was nearly comatose from gluttony. The magic word: profiteroles. These weren't just any profiteroles, they were magic and served alongside a dark, warm chocolate sauce and a gooey clearly homemade caramel sauce -- foodgasm!", "author": "Christine K."}

Meal starts off with bread and a delicious pesto dipping sauce.  My friend and I shared 3 dishes: mista salad, gnocchi, and the cioppino.  Mista salad was simple and standard.  The gnocchi needed a little more flavor so we added a little parm cheese and it punched it up. And the cioppino had plenty of seafood to share with great dipping sauce for our bread.  The service was attentive and they split our dishes for us without having to ask.

They got the outdoor / indoor seating just like if it was on Columbus Street and the same uber Italian waiters with accents. I have to say dining here is definitely a little more intimate because of how the tables are set up so closely. It is almost like a giant family.\n\nThe food they have is good but not great. We got the carpaccio and wild boar ragu. The first is pretty standard with the usual flavors of capers, Parmesan,  arugula and lemon juice.  The latter was a little disappointing, meat seemed like it could have been any ground meat. However, the sauce and pasta were well done.

Hubby picked it out this place based on the great reviews from Check Please, Bay Area.  Parking on Union St is a bit atrocious, but it's kind of expected for that area.  We were able to find a space 3 streets up (steep climb!), but it's ok.  Good to get some exercise.  Anyway, we were seated promptly when we got there about 5 minutes early.  Waiter was attentive and prompt.  We shared the octopus with polenta cake.  OMG...it was so delicious!  The octopus was very tender and flavorful.  Then my husband ordered the mushroom risotto with prawns and i ordered the lobster gnocchi.  Both were delicious and the portions were generous.  Were pretty stuffed.  The good thing about these dishes was that they weren't too salty.  Just right amount of flavor.  Then we ordered the pork cutlet to share.  That was delicious as well.  For dessert, i had the hot chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato and hubby got a cappuccino.  Overall, it was a memorable dining experience.  I really liked it.  Nice and efficient, no fluff, and the place wasn't stuffy.  \n\nI did overheard from the diners at the next table they felt rushed.  I kind of understood that because they did clear our plates quite quickly and there wasn't a  lot of waiting time in-between courses.  But I'm used to eating fast, so it wasn't a real issue for me.  But if you want to savor every bite and take your time, then it might feel like you're being rushed.  Overall, 5 stars!!!  Will go back again.", "author": "Mary C."}

Well that's Capannina for you, and I'd probably take it over all the pasta (almost) in North Beach.\n\nYou can feel the authenticity here, not just in the ingredients and subtle flavors, but with the waitstaff as well. You get the sense the staff knows their regular clientele, but also makes newcomers feel part of the family.\n\nWhen eating Italian, I use the Mozzarella di Bufala as a standard test, and Capannina's came up fresh and soft, creamy but with just the right bitterness. All the pasta dishes sounded good but our waiter convinced me of the merits of the Veal Scaloppine, and it was a revelation. Again on our waiter's suggestion, we paired the meal with an excellent Nero D'Avola that reminded me that, even with Napa and Sonoma to our north, sometimes the old masters know how to crush some grapes.\n\nIn a way I'm glad this place is not within walking distance of my abode; I'd probably eat here at least once a week otherwise.", "author": "Nish N."}

There was just nothing of interest there either.  Everything tasted one-dimmensional and a bit bland. \n\nGiven the reviews, I expected a lot more from this place. I was genuinely disappointed.  I do see why Campannina is popular given its nice ambience and the friendly service, but I just cannot recommend this place to fellow ChowHounds, Egulleters, and Zagateers.

Seafood?  Italian?  I mean, with & by REAL Italians?...What's not to love?\n\nEven at 10pm, the place was packed, both inside and out--good sign.  The space is \"cozy-modern\" and doesn't waste a square inch, so waiting room is limited to 2-4 people max...quarters are tight, but don't hamper the staff from running a well-oiled machine.\n\nThere are a handful of sidewalk tables that would be pretty sweet on a warm summer night for people-watching on Union Street (heat lamps keep it nice and cozy even on a January night).  We were seated inside within 10 minutes of arriving and got down to business.\n\nPrompt, knowledgeable, and attentive service all-around...waters & drinks appeared immediately, followed by bread (not the crusty rustic bread I prefer, but oh well) and a pesto-type spread (arugula maybe...?).  After comparing item prices, the BF and I opted to skip the 4-course prix fixe special ($85 ea) and went \u00e0 la carte instead.  I got the Crab Ravioli w/Black Truffle Sauce: light texture, rich flavor, fresh house-made ravioli perfectly al dente.  Would have liked some greens (mmm, antioxidants :P), but still satisfying & delish!  BF got the Mixed Seafood Grill w/Lemon Caper Sauce and Spinach: sea bass, salmon + 2 gigantic prawns over a bed of saut\u00e9ed spinach...appropriate portioning (not supersized, but definitely filling).  The fish was succulent and flavorful, and the prawns were killer.....great smokiness without the cancerous overcharring.\n\nGet the Warm Chocolate Cake!!  No kidding around....Ooey-gooey, velvety smooth, semi-sweet rather than cloyingly sugary, melt-in-your-mouth goodness!!  And the gelato....!!  Hazelnut heaven!!  Will have to try their cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e next time around......yum!\n\nCan't say enough about the staff; good-natured, cheeky, prompt, amiable.....Around 11:15, fun New Year's hats were passed out to patrons...the owner was circulating the floor all night, greeting guests and stopping to chat to regulars....very mom-n-pop vibe AND classy.\n\n\nOther joints should take a lesson in impeccable service....before ordering dessert, one of the waitstaff very graciously and sheepishly asked if we minded moving to a smaller, \"more romantic\" booth tucked in a nook to accommodate a larger party waiting to be seated (we were at a 4-seater).  The owner also chimed in, apologizing and thanking us as we shifted to our new hideaway.  Since we were in between courses, wasn't a bit disruptive, and when you're asked so nicely, perch\u00e9 no?\n\nThe damage?  No worries....that piggybank is safe!  All told, ~$84 for 2 entr\u00e9es, 2 glasses of wine + dessert (tax & tip included)....of course, it helped that the dessert was comped for the seat shuffle, but even so, very reasonable value for the quality of service + food.  Will definitely be back, especially to take advantage of the insane $25 3-course prix fixe deal from 5-6pm.....can't wait to try that cioppino!!\n\nBring dates!  Bring family!  Bring friends!  You won't be disappointed!", "author": "Amy K."}

I mean...the BEST service I've had at a restaurant. Our waiter was warm, checked up on us often, had WONDERFUL wine recommendations, and most importantly, he didn't rush us out of there. They had reservations up the wazoo, and they acted like we could have stayed there until kingdom come. You really felt taken care of there. I would say 5 stars on service!\n\nNow on to the food! The food was...ok. We started off with the crab bruschetta, which was quite delicious and a nice refreshing start to the meal. For the main meal, I got a risotto with half lobster, and it was filling, but the flavors were not amazing. I was underwhelmed with the dish. However, I feel like I got one of the weaker dishes. Another person at my table got the cioppino, which I tried, and it was delicious! We got tiramisu and a chocolate cake for dessert, which were both good as well.  So, I'm a little disappointed in my dinner choice, but I would still come back here to give it a second try and find a dish there that really makes me swoon.

Salmon was super super dry. One person in our group ordered linguini with clams, tried to ask for Alfredo-type cream sauce, they kept bringing a wine-butter type sauce, and all of the clams were just the shells. The only wonderful thing was that they brought a little bowl of clams out when she mentioned something about it. The wild boar ragout, I thought, was awful.

They didn't even take our drink order until I finally asked if we could order drinks when the waiter started to try to take our food order!!! And when two of us had empty wine glasses he didn't ask if we wanted another. He never stayed at the table long enough for us to ask for anything more than the one food order. And they cleared our plates when some of us still had food left! Good thing we didn't want desert because it wasn't offered to us.

Next we had the black-ink risotto and the risotto with langoustine - both were simply amazing, and the portions were generous.  We finished the meal with seabass and seared ahi.  The seabass was cooked perfectly; soft and moist and flaky in all the right ways.  My ahi had a perfect sear to it without being too crusted in pepper.

Being Italian and having my grandmother cook authentic Italian meals growing up, I can often be a bit picky when it comes to eating out at Italian restaurants.   That was definitely not a worry here.\n\nAtmosphere:  Capannina is nice cozy restaurant on Union.  They had a few tables for outside seating (with heaters) which we would have loved to try, but it was a little too cold the night we went.  We made reservations here on Yelp (thank you OpenTable) and didn't have to wait at all.  We were seated right away in a nice 2-person table right by the window, which was perfect for people watching and not having to eat right next to another table.  The restaurant isn't big, and space is a little tight, but it's very nice.\n\nWine:  They have some good options for wine, including half bottles, which I love to get.  They had both Italian and Californian varietals by the glass, half bottle, and bottle.  Prices were pretty good, around 9-12 for glass and 21-25 for half bottle. \n\nFood:  The food was great.  We just started off with some bread and their basil/pesto olive oil, very tasty (although our bread was cold, if it was warm, this would have been amazing!)  My fianc\u00e9e got the Penne Abbarita with shrimp (but replaced the penne with linguine at the server's recommendation) and I got the ravioli with buffalo mozzarella with prosciutto.  The sauces were very good and we both cleaned our plates.  Portions were also generous, nothing to skimpy.  We don't usually order desserts, but we saw the warm chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato at the table next to us and couldn't resist.  It was incredible!  If you come here, try this dessert, you wont be disappointed.  \n\nService:  The service was excellent.  Our wine glasses were always filled for us and the water was replenished the entire night.

They have a 3-course $25 pre fixe 5-6pm, which sounds like a great deal. \n\nIt is not your usual Americano Italiano restaurant, or Californiano Italiano restaurant (A16?)...and I totally made the words up. It's a classy looking Italian restaurant that serves AUTHENTIC, simple and clean tasting food that Italians would actually eat in Italy. \n\nFirst time there was a while ago with a girlfriend, late at night, got a table immediately, great service with charming italian accent. We got the steamed mussels with white wine and saffron broth, PERFETTO!! It just hit the spot, and the broth is so good with the bread. I actually \"drank\" the broth with a spoon, just couldn't let a drop go. The other thing I remembered was the meatball spaghetti my girl friend ordered, which I thought was going to be boring. But the meatballs were incredibly juicy and flavorful, and the spaghetti was cooked just right with a little hard cores. Don't remember anything else from the dinner, but thought it was great.\n\nSecond time was a couple nights ago. We went in feeling not so hungry at all, so we ordered the squid ink risotto with seared scallop from the appetizer menu, and clams/mussels linguine with white wine sauce from the primi. The linguine was very tasty, simple, clean to taste, yet flavorful. The risotto was AMAZING. HUGE portion as an appetizer, just the right amount of creaminess, packed with flavors, and perfectly seared scallop on top. I finished EVERY SINGLE piece of rice on my plate, and that says a lot since I HATE rice.\n\nSeeing and hearing the waiter trying very hard to explain everything with heavy italian accent just melts my heart and brings me back to the good summers when i lived in Italy.\n\nDefinitely a great, low key, excellent place in Marina/Cow Hollow. The atmosphere is great for dates, parents in town, or with close friends who appreciate the food and company. But I found talking about serious business and talking aggressively like people next to our table pretty, damn, annoying.", "author": "Yuchi C."}

I used to lived nearby and would have gone there more frequently, but my first experience there really soured me.  It seemed that nearly everything I asked for got rejected (I have some dietary restrictions and am a picky eater).  I can handle when some requests can't be honored... but not ALL of them.  And the part that really got me is the way in which my waiter seemed to sneer at me when I requested any change to a menu item.  Eventually I told him we would have to leave because none of our preferences could be honored, and he just moved the table for us to leave immediately without saying a word.

We were greeted by a pleasant Italian man who, when we responded in Italian, spoke with us in Italian and showed us immediately to our 9:00 pm table for six. From our vantage point we could see a steady stream of beautifully plated, generously portioned dishes coming from the kitchen. We were dining while they featured black truffle specialties and decided to partake. We love truffles and the generous portions on the risotto and linguine didn't disappoint. The pasta was perfectly al dente and well sauced. The truffle risotto and spinach risottos were a tad over coked but flavorful. The squid ink risotto was perfectly al dente likely indicating that it, unlike the others, is cooked to order. We had meltingly tender, well seasoned, short ribs, mixed seafood grill, and grilled tuna steak cooked perfectly rare for our entrees and a round of mixed and caprese salads that were all delicious. For dessert we had warm chocolate cake, and tiramisu, both well made and traditional. The Pinot noir we had with diner was one of the better wines I have had recently and was recommended by our waiter based on our food orders. It was a great evening out.

You know you are off to a good start when the waiter nods and gives you that 'you did good' smile.  The beet salad was beautifully presented and a lovely starter - perfectly roasted red and gold beets served with goat cheese, toasted walnuts and a handful of perfectly dressed greens.  The wild boar ragu.. yum!  The papperdelle was the perfect al dente accompaniment for the amazingly rich yet earthy amazing ragu.  \n\nI did not personally review the wine list, but the selections we enjoyed were fantastic - a prosecco, a lovely crisp white (a Sicilian wine I believe), and a bold, chewy red (super Tuscan?).  (Finished off with a lovely after dinner bubbly that magically appeared on our table.)  Dessert samplers also magically appeared.  (Love that - can have a taste, but save the real sugar allotment for the drinks!)\n\nI hope someone else orders the pappardelle on my next visit so I can taste it again, but I can make my way through some of the other scrumptious options!

Having tried so many cioppinos throughout the city, I was a little skeptical but had to try it.  I was impressed.  I think the key to a good cioppino is a great broth (since the seafood in SF tends to be pretty fresh at any good restaurant) and Capannina's cioppino had a great broth.  the seafood was delicious and plentiful.  The lobster was also a nice touch- i think this is the first time i had lobster in my cioppino but it went will with the meal.

While the rest of the menu looks awesome and I'm sure you'd be happy ordering off of it, the prix fixe menu is only available from 5-6 pm and if you have the chance to try it, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.\n\nI had the PORK CUTLET MILANESE with TRICOLORE SALAD. I love weinerschnitzel but I'd have to say this was the best pork cutlet that I've ever had. The panko beading was light, crispy, and had a hint of a buttery taste (but not greasy at all.) Squirt on some fresh lemon and mmmmmmm..... \n\nBut I should talk about my first course. I had a ZUCCHINI SOUP WITH LUMP CRAB and it was excellent. I added salt to really bring out the taste, but I almost always do that with soups. The portion of crab was not only generous but it was of very good quality. My girlfriend really like it, too. She had a salad for her first course and she liked it very much.\n\nMy girlfriend got the PAPPARADELLE AND WILD BOAR RAGU, and she loved it. She primarily eats vegetarian but when a vegetarian selection is hard to find, she'll resort to eating meat. There wasn't a vegetarian selection on the prix fixe menu so she went with the wild boar.

She's really good about that!)\n\nThe other two entrees on the prix fixe menu were PESTO CRUSTED SALMON and BRICK PRESSED CHICKEN WITH SWISS CHARD. Both of these entrees looked good when they came out for other patrons.\n\nWe had four choices of dessert on the prix fixe menu. I got the cannoli as it's not something that I often see and enjoy eating. It was fair, but it was our least favorite part of the evening. My girlfriend, on the other hand, got the hot chocolate cake and hazelnut ice cream and it was excellent.\n\nThe waiter was great. Authentic Italian, very nice, very knowledgeable, very attentive. The atmosphere was very nice; I wouldn't change a thing.\n\nThis was a great Italian restaurant in a city noted for great dining.

The restaurant is a small and intimate one with a nice feel to it. It isn't over done or trendy, just pleasant. We were greeted at the door and sat immediately. Our waiter was appropriately friendly and helpful with the menu and wine selection. We split the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer and the gnocchi as a first course. The mozzarella dish was very nice. All the dish layers were fresh and made for a wonderful dish. The gnocchi was in a Gorgonzola cream sauce with asparagus and was delicious!  I could have eaten the whole thing myself. I expected it to be a somewhat heavy dish but the gnocchi were light and so was the cream sauce. I had the seared ahi on spicy shrimp risotto. The risotto was amazing!  The ahi was great too (slightly too salty), but I really enjoyed the risotto. My husband had the beef short rib. He really liked it (although I thought mine was better). Although quite full by this time, we decided we should try the tiramisu. I always get worried about tiramisu because it has been so over done and, having lived in Italy for a year, I'm snobby about it. This tiramisu was fabulous. It reminded me of the ones I ate in Italy. That is the best compliment I can give it. The restaurant is in a neat area of lots of cool shops and other bars and restaurants.

It's tough to have two fabulous Italian restaurants next door to one another, especially when they look so similar.  Tough in a good way, since I love Italian food.\n\nWhile Pane et Vino is cozy, Capannina is a bit more exquisite, but still simple and flavorful.  I like eating outside under the heat lamps.  The atmosphere is quaint, yet elegant, and some of the pasta is homemade.  My table ordered a lot of Prosecco last time we were here, so this review will have to be short.

He was super friendly, very funny and he knew the menu and the wines like the back of his hand. \n\nThere were so many things on the menu that I wanted to try, but I didn't want to be overly wasteful so we just kept the ordering to a minimum. \n\nFor appetizer we had the beef carpaccio. This was your standard carpaccio dish and it was very, very good. \n\nFor 1st plate we had the pappardelle cinghiale which is pappardella  with wild boar ragu. This was definitely my absolute favorite part of the meal. The pasta was perfectly al dente and the sauce was one of the best ragu styles that I've ever had inside a restaurant.\n\nFor my entree, I went with rack of lamb with black truffle mashed potatoes and steamed greens. I wasn't liking my lamb very much. It just wasn't cooked the way I wanted. It was good, but still, just not what I was wanting to eat. So I asked my date if he'd trade with me. \n\nFor his entree, he went with brick pressed roasted chicken with steamed greens and baked potato wedges. He wasn't too impressed with his entree. So we switched. He really liked mine and I really liked his. Yay! Problem solved. The highlight of both of those entrees was the black truffle mashed potatoes. I couldn't stop eating them. I kept stealing them off of his plate after we had switched entrees. At one point, he went to the restroom and I was eating his truffle mashed potatoes. When he came back, our funny waiter leaned over and told him \"She was stealing your potatoes! I saw her!!\" hahah... \n\nAnd for dessert we had the vanilla bean panna cotta with a pear cooked in red wine and raspberry sorbet with a sugar crisp cookie. THIS WAS AMAZING!!! The panna cotta was just delightful. The pear interesting and yummy. The raspberry sorbet. Wow. That was so good. And the presentation was amazing as well. *pics to come soon*\n\nAnd to wash all that down, we had a super Tuscan Tassinaia and at the end, each a glass of Prosecco. \n\nThis meal was simply fantastic.

The Gorgonzola sauce was flavorful, but not too overpowering of the delicate spears of asparagus that added a nice texture and flavor to the overall dish. \n\nOur Italian waiter was a little off-putting at first with his extremely loud voice and arrogant \"I know everything about wine\" attitude. However, he gave us a suggestion for a bottle of Barbera that turned out to be an excellent accompaniment to our meal. \n\nI've never included a bathroom review because I believe it's more about the food than the facility, but in the case of Capannina, I have to say something about the squalor they call a bathroom. \n\nFirst of all, there's only one bathroom and it's used by all. And when I say by all, I mean the front of the house and kitchen staff as well as patrons. I went in before our meal was served and was greeted by a huge puddle of urine around the base of the toilet. It resembled a bar restroom. OK, no biggie, my legs are strong and can squat and avoid the puddle at my feet. \n\nMy second trip to the bathroom at the end of the meal proved to be even more disturbing than the first. In the hour and a half since my last visit, the bathroom had been rode hard and put away wet. \n\nAs I was searching for a place to hang up my purse so it didn't sit on the disgustingly dirty floor, I heard a gurgling sound coming from the sink. I turned around to find water, chunks of food and hair coming up from the drain. The dishwasher drain backed up and had nowhere to go but in the sink drain? I dunno, but it was a truly gross sight and not a good way to end a nice meal. \n\nBeware of that bathroom. Things may come up from the drain and bite you!", "author": "Lee H."}

An 04' Rosso  was a little bit much for the peaches and flowers so I opted for the local bubbly, a traditional nv prosecco which sliced the bacon and married the peaches. \n\nFor the primi, the rich and delicious pappardelle with wild boar and mushroom ragu was outstanding. The pappardelle (from pappare, which not coincidentally in Italian means to gobble up) was a perfect date for an 04 Il Poggione Rosso. \n\nFor the secondi, the mixed seafood grill, a lobster, salmon and halibut that although it reminded me of Italy, did not remind me of what I loved in Italy. Italy, especially inland, is not known for it's seafood naturally. In hindsight I would have gone with the lamb which looked like a huge dish but would have been a better bet. \n\nFor dessert, the Tiramisu, a very sweet recommendation that met expectations.

I think you see where I am going with this - the restaurant itself is very forgettable.\n\nOn weekdays between 5-6 pm, Capannina offers a $25 prix fixe menu.  Yes, I know what you're thinking - early bird special, right?  Well, you're right.  Heck, we're old and cheap; why not take advantage of the great deal?  We showed up at 5:45 pm, and we were the first ones there.  No one else in the whole restaurant!\n\nOur waiter was really nice and very Italian, which made the whole experience even more comical.  He was almost too Italian; if he were playing a role of an Italian waiter, you'd think he was overacting.  He was very polite and considerate, however.  No complaints there.\n\nIf you opted for a prix fixe menu, you were presented with a few choices.  There were 3 appetizer options (two salads and a soup), 4 entrees (chicken, pork, salmon and something vegetarian) and 8 desserts.  \n\n{For those of you mathematically inclined, here's a question for you: How many different meals can you create, if you can select from 3 appetizers, 4 entrees and 8 desserts, assuming you can only have one of each?  Scroll to the end of the review to find out the answer}.\n\nMy 3 course meal consisted of vegetable puree soup with goat cheese, salmon with cauliflower and tiramisu.  \n\nMy soup tasted like it was made Progresso - that's Italian, right?  It wasn't nearly thick enough, and all I could taste was chicken broth and indiscernible boiled vegetables.   If it hadn't been for bread crusted goat cheese and sparsely sprinkled basil, I could swear the soup came out of a microwave.\n\nThe salmon was very juicy and cooked just right.  I wish I could say the same for the bed--and I use this term lightly--of steamed vegetables.  My cauliflower was overcooked, and even the broccoli, which was an unpleasant surprise not mentioned in the menu, looked like it barely survived a nuclear holocaust.  The vegetables looked sad, kind of like their best years were behind them and they accepted their fate far too early.\n\nTiramisu was served with pieces of white chocolate.  The white chocolate was deeee-licious, while the tiramisu itself tasted like it was recently thawed out.  It was watery and overpowered by its own cocoa sprinkles.\n\nI'd say, it's not a bad value for $25, but if I had to pay full prices, I would be pretty PO'd.\n\nA: 3 x 4 x 8 = 96 different dinner combinations", "author": "Yan G."}

We had heard great things from fellow yelpers and they were right! The restaurant was bustling when we showed up but we had a reservation and were seated right away. \n\nAs soon as I looked at the menu, I instantly wanted to come back already. The menu had so many delicious things to choose from. It was hard making the decision on what to eat. We started off with the beet salad which was very good. For the next course, we got the papardelle with wild boar ragu and as my friend would say, \"We could have eaten the papardelle for days!\"  For entrees we shared the beef tenderloin which cut like butter and the ahi tuna which was perfectly seared. It came with a rock shrimp risotto which was absolutely divine. We were so full so we had to pass on dessert. \n\nThe wine list was quite extensive with a variety of wines by the glass, half bottles, domestic and of course, Italian wines. \n\nDefinitely want to go back already with a larger group and try more things!", "author": "Josephine H."}

The waitstaff was attentive during the entire meal - our primary waiter was charismatic and extremely friendly.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere -- it was not so loud that I had to strain to hear my friend or yell across the table. \r\n\r\nMy friend ordered the risotto.  He said it ranked among the top risotto experiences he's had.  I ordered the gnocchi with artichoke and wild boar ragu -- the gnocchi was so delicate, they were like little pillows of heaven -- not at all like the gnocchi I normally have to stomach -- dense potato rock balls slathered in cream sauce.  My friend and I started with the Caesar Salad with Crab Meat.  Although it did not taste like the authentic egg/anchovy caesar salad, I was still very impressed -- the crab meat portion was quite generous and the dressing was light.  For dessert, I had the panna cotta and my friend had the tiramisu and a capuccino.  My friend commented that the tiramisu was pretty forgettable.  The panna cotta had a distinct flavor -- creamy with a hint of lemon and a berry sauce kicker.\r\n\r\nAccording to my friend, the capuccino was one of the most amazing capuccinos he's had in the states.  He was completely enamored and raving about it.  He said he felt like he was in Rome again -- he really savored his capuccino.  He actually wants to come back to the restaurant just to get another cup!  I liked the little heart design they created on the crema/foam.  ha ha!  Be sure to order the capuccino!", "author": "Karen K."}

I am just shy of being one of those always cold chicks, and I was downright toasty. The wine soothed my aching heart.  Then came the food....\n\nThe beet salad and mixed seafood grill morphed my heartbroken nibble only appetite into a voracious lust for delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-12", "description": "Basically very bland throughout. We were there recently for a company dinner, about 12 of us. The service was lackluster. We weren't served very promptly and we had to continually flag the servers over for water refills, bread, clearing plates, etc. If this place is going to make any kind of dent in a city that already has way too many excellent trattorias, then service will have to improve.\n\nOn a quiet night, with few other customers, we certainly made the place busier. But the appetizers and entrees were just so so. The asparagus puree for the soup was underseasoned. The salads came with some wilted lettuce leaves --though it was well dressed. Then the entrees. I had the breaded pork cutlet, the cottoleta. It was enormous, in the wienerschnitzel league in terms of size. It might well have been German-inspired because it was heavily breaded, seasoned well with lemon and served with a cranberry compote that actually went well. The tricolore salad, however, did nothing to complement the dish. The three \"colors\" were represented by some beets, some cabbage (no color) and another underseasoned root vegetable. I guess some kind of light pasta like some angel hair or farfalle would have been too much to ask.\n\nI also sampled some other entrees --from fellow diners--: the grilled salmon did not taste fresh, and was lacking some kind depth in the sauce. It was also cold. The risotto was OK, but certainly nothing to write home about. The cod seemed slippery. The rabbit, which was the evening's special, was dark and too gamey ---odd because rabbit is usually not gamey at all. It really does --or should--taste like chicken.\n\nOn to the desserts, where the restaurant just cannot turn out a decent tiramisu. Too wet. Too old. Not fresh tasting. Those were some of the comments, and I have to agree. Some argue that this is one true test of a fine Italian restaurant, and they may be right. But what I wonder is this: you would think that a place like this would have perfected this by now! That said, the un-Italian profiteroles were magnificent --the tender petit choux that we dipped in the awesome chocolate AND caramel sauce, were divine. But this is a French dish, not an Italian one. The gelati and sorbettos were just OK, but not as good as the Ciao Bella ones or even Gelato Clasico. Finally, the coffee was pretty soothing.", "author": "Alfonso L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-07-21", "description": "I really want to give Capannina 5 stars, but I can't help but dream about the Italian food back east in Chambersburg (\"The Burg\" for you other Central Jersey vixens).  As far as Italian food goes, coming from a Jersey boy in a town where everyone is Italian, I have yet to taste anything west of the \"tri state area\" that comes even close.  For California Italian though, this place is my absolute new favorite, much better than anything in North Beach.  \n\nFirst off, the owner is the cat's meow, he makes sure to both welcome you to the restaurant and check in with you during dinner to make sure your dining experience is perfect--exactly what you should expect from a good Italian restaurant.  The first time I ate there, I was running late and he went out of his way to open up the spot in front of the restaurant for me to park in (there was a white chair reserving the spot) . . . how's that for service.\n\nSecondarily, the menu is solid on all counts, homemade pastas, fresh seafood, different meats, etc.  Of note, the menu is not your standard Italian fare of Chicken Picatta, Linguine w/Clams, and Spaghetti w/Meatballs.  This is classy, Mediteranean-Italian with California flare.    For appies, I've had the crab salad which did not skimp on the crab, the tuna tartare which was ruby red and for entrees, the seared tuna over cous cous, the halibut over shrimp risotto, and the special a couple weeks back which was a half-lobster in a spicy marinara sauce.  All dishes have been cooked perfectly and were plated so nicely with sauces that provided the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and vibrant color.\n\nLastly, the only downside I can think of for this place is that they do not have a full bar.  Given their extensive wine list, probably not an issue for most folks, but for me, a crisp, chilled vodka straight up is the way I like to start my dinners when I am out.", "author": "Rick V."}

I have passed by this place not realizing that it was Capannina but thinking that it looked like a nice little restaurant.   It's a quaint little restaurant that has a nice and cozy decor.  \n\nWe started with the Caesar salad with fresh dungeness crab and the crab cake with lobster vodka sauce.  The salad was very delicious, not over burdened with a heavy dressing but rather a light and flavorful dressing that allows you to taste the delicious crab that goes with the salad.  The crab cake was equally as good ( my dinner mate didn't quite like it as much as I did though).  I just loved the lobster vodka sauce.   \n\nNext we had the ravioli con mozzarella di bufala e prosciutto which looked greasy but was pretty delicious.  What made it for me were the garlic chips which added a nice smoky touch.  We also ordered the carbonara with black truffles.  Nice dish, truffles flavors were just enough without being too overbearing.  The sauce was a little rich but the more I ate, the more I liked it.\n\nLast savory dish we ordered was seared rare ahi tuna over spicy prawn risotto.  The ahi was just so-so but the risotto delicious!\n\nFor dessert we got the tiramisu and the custard filled profiteroles with chocolate & caramel dipping sauce.  The tiramisu was memorable but in a bad way.  Tasted watered down and bland like it was frozen.  The profiteroles were quite delicious on the other hand.  \n\nLast I like to mention the great service we got.  Wait staff was attentive and perfect on their timing.\n\nI am a fan of this place.  I would have given this place 5 star but there were a few things like the ahi, tiramisu, and coffee (not very good) that made me take a star away.", "author": "Gordon S."}

From what I've read here and watched on CPBA, I expected lively greetings, a happy \"thank you so much for coming\", and to be quickly whisked to our seats.  I guess that they didn't get the memo...or maybe I didn't.\n\nRound One\n\nThe menu was quite impressive.  I love that they don't have a million options to choose from, but rather, quality, interesting dishes that are just asing to be ordered.  I had the Gamberi Piccanti Con Polenta (Spicy Prawns with Crisp Polenta Cake and Basil Aioli), and hubby had the Calamari Ripieni Con Granchio (Fresh Monterey Calamari Staffed with Crab and Potato).  I must say, I was in love with my dish the moment it came out.  There were two beautiful prawns, seasoned perfectly, each sitting atop a yummy little crunchy polenta cake.  I don't know how they seasoned the prawns, but all I wanted to do was order seconds and thirds...maybe next time.  \n\nHubby's calamari was good too, but in round 1, the prawns won.\n\nRound Two\n\nI ordered the Pappardelle con Funghi e Sugo di Cinghiale (Pappardelle with Mushrooms and Wild Boar Ragu), and hubby ordered the Ravioli con Mozzarella di Bufala e Prosciutto (Buffalo Mozzarella & Prosciutto Ravioli in Tomato Sauce with Garlic Chips).  Now, I normally wouldn't have ordered what I did because I try to stay away from mushrooms (it's an aversion with fungus directly atttributed to Mr. Hill's 9th grade biology class), but I couldn't turn away from trying wild boar.  The dish was definitely delicious...the boar had a nice texture to it and a slightly different flavor from what I am used to.  Hubby's ravioli didn't interest me as much because I felt like it was a bit too cheesy/saucy, which just isn't my thing.  But he certainly loved it - bufalo mozzarella and prosciutto is like heaven to him.\n\nI think that Round 2 was a draw.\n\nRound Three\n\nI'm not even going to try to compare these dishes.

We went with a big party to celebrate a friend's birthday. At first the waiters seemed happy and excited to see us, but since we had a couple of guests who were a little late, they got slightly annoyed. I guess that's understandable, but it made it tougher to judge the service. Perhaps not the best for groups in that case?\n\nBut my pasta dish was absolutely incredible! I had the spaghetti di spinaci and it was the freshest, most flavorful pasta I've had in a long while. Very authentic (at least it seemed- what does a flyrish know about authentic Italian food?). They had one vegan pasta dish (artichoke ravioli) that my man enjoyed but didn't rave about. My friends loved their meat and seafood entrees. And I got to sample a bit of the mouthwatering zucchini blossoms with ricotta. The Italian wine was a perfect compliment to the food as well. \n\nI would definitely go back to sample more of their menu and to see if they indeed deserve five stars.

We started with some perfect oysters and deliciously creamy squid-ink risotto with truffled scallops. The 5 of us split the rest of our meal family-style: pillowy, slightly spicy olive gnocchi with rock shrimp cut into gnocchi-size bites, pretty standard veal with lemon sauce, swordfish (usually not my favorite fish but quite tender and tasty), and perfectly prepared lamb chops with creamy polenta. Dessert was pretty typical -- the tiramisu and creme brulee were about what you'd expect. The total, including two bottles of wine: about $60/head.\n\nThe decor was bright, with lots of open space, metal, glass, and marble -- it would be a good date place, though not a particularly \"cozy\" one (c.f. Luisa's or Ristorante Milano).\n\nInterestingly, our waiter seemed to have a tic where every ten seconds or so he'd spray out a heavily accented random Italian phrase.

I always trust their recommendations - food and wine. \n\nThe atmosphere is so cozy, warm and happy colors, beautiful flowers. The marble bar to seat four. It's classy and elegant, while remaining down to earth and warm. I've gone in alone, on dates, with friends, and even a Christmas party - table for 12. It's always a nice experience.\n\nI have tried most everything and it's all wonderful, but my favorites that I keep coming back for: Veal Scallopini on a bed of spinach with lemon risotto - the best Veal Scallopini I've ever had. When I'm going for a smaller dish, I get the Black Ink Risotto - it's on the appetizer menu, but for one person, it's a meal. Seasonal, and oh so delicious: the asparagus with prawns. And I don't know where the pasta with the spicy sausage went, but it's became another favorite. Maybe i'll see it again soon!\n\nWine list is fantastic... and they always have a nice glass of Prosecco when I'm waiting (which usually is not a long wait at all). Another added benefit - half bottle selection!\n\nDessert - hands down the warm chocolate cake. I can't even put into words how decadent. Hazelnut gelato, it all melts together.  Be sure and get a Cappuccino - Alex makes a damn good Cappuccino and sometimes a little heart out of the foam! \n\nOutdoor seating is another great perk - heat lamps of course.\n\nIn regards to the negative review I saw regarding the bathroom - I've never had an issue - I never have to wait more than a few minutes. And it always has pretty flowers and a fun chalkboard with notes written - just be careful to not brush up against it when you are wearing black!\n\nI'm so very very pleased with everything about this restaurant, every single time I go.", "author": "Lindsey C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-18", "description": "A solid four stars, perhaps even working toward 4 and a half stars.\n\nThis is a nice little Italian restaurant.  Not terribly stuffy or formal, but the wait staff is very attentive.  The waiters are dressed formally and all speak Italian.  The owner circulates constantly about the room in his cocktail shirt with the top two buttons undone, checking on patrons and shaking hands.   Honestly from the demeanor of the staff, I feel like I'm in Italy.\n\nThe restaurant has a fairly small to moderate single room but the booth in the back corner is quite romantic.  They use all the appropriate flatware and have correct wine glasses.\n\nThw wine list is pretty good and reasonably priced for what you get.  The focus is on above average to excellent Italian wines, so the average price of a bottle is a bit high (about $50-70) but the mark-up is not exorbitant.  Even their wines by the glass are decent.\n\nThe food is very good.  Excellent, really.  The menu is creative and shows that the chef is constantly experimenting.  Unfortunately, this experimentation is a bit risky in terms of flavor and texture pairings.  Don't get me wrong, because the food is fantastic -- the gnocchi are the best I have ever had (as good as my homemade gnocchi) -- pillow soft and delicate.  The short ribs and the sea bass, the pasta, the antipasti, in fact all the dishes I have had there were perfecty cooked.  Very impressive.  \n\nSo if I am being critical, it is because when I think about giving a rating of five stars, the food must be transcendent of its genre.  Here, it is very, very good, but it neither illuminates not surprises.  For about $200 for two people for dinner, I expect the food to be sublime and the service spectacular.  \n\nSo really what we have here is a little neighborhood restaurant with a touch of Italian formality that serves up extremely good if traditional fare (as opposed to noveau Italian cuisine).  Probably the best Italian restaurant in San Francisco for traditional Italian food, but is it worth the price?  Hard to say.\n\nFor a slight decrease in quality, you can save a lot of money at several good Italian restaurants in town.  If money is no object, or you really want the best traditional Italian food, okay, eat here.", "author": "Adrian B."}

I had the mozzarella and prosciutto ravioli which had just the right amount of cheese, sauce, and tomatoes. My bf had the penne salsiccia with spinach and goat cheese which tasted just a good. The champagne we ordered went well with our meal as well. Since we only wanted pasta this particular evening, I would consider going back to try some of the seafood dishes mentioned in other yelp reviews. However, based on the service, which is why I am only giving 3 stars, I am not sure if I will return.\n\nService:\nI really don't want to downgrade the review based on service, especially as it seemed like there were very few servers working the evening we dined here. However, it took quite some time before we were able to place our drink order, and even more time for water to be brought to our table. In fact, we did not receive bread at our table until after we placed our meal order. When our champagne was initially brought out and poured, the staff person left the bottle right on the table. Eventually someone else brought an ice bucket out for the champagne. \n\nAtmosphere: \nThe restaurant is cute and small inside, and there are a couple tables just outside the restaurant as well. \n\nValue: \nThe total wasn't bad for two people and the quality of the food. \n\nOverall, if the service was a little better I would be more inclined to recommend this place.", "author": "Cynthia D."}

It's not the best Italian on the planet, but it's definitely good enough. I probably won't come back here, however, because I just don't think it's that much of a wow factor. \n\nI ordered filet mignon ($38) and it was absolutely one of the best filets I've ever had. HOWEVER, it was served, and I kid you not, with what seemed to be breakfast-style potatoes. I mean, the menu description claimed it was served over \"roasted red potatoes\"...so to me, that translates to real roasted red potatoes. Well, when my dish arrived, I seriously thought they potatoes had come out of a Tyson bag and were shaken in an MSG rub...they were good...but really not the type of thing you serve with filet mignon.\n\nThere's really not a lot of room to have larger parties (more than 4) here. There were five of us in my party and we were kinda squished into a table that would comfortably serve 2-3 and at most, four. Allow me to add that we ate a VERY early dinner (5:15 reservations on a Saturday night) and requested to move to a larger table. The owner/host wasn't able to move us (even though we and one other couple were literally the only people in the restaurant) so...that kinda rubbed us all the wrong way.\n\nNeedless to say, it was definitely good food. But, it wasn't anything unique that I couldn't make at home with the right ingredients.

SO GOOD. The risotto was cooked perfectly and the scallops on top were flavorful and seared perfectly. Yum yum yum.\n\nMy girlfriend got the calamari stuffed with crab and, Mary Mother of God, that too was amazing. My mom started with the crab cake and said it was the second-best crab cake she's ever eaten. About three decades ago, she had some crab cake in Knoxville, TN, of all places, that was the most amazing crab cake she's ever had. She's been chasing that white rabbit ever since and said this was the closest she's come to catching it. \n\nMy gf and I split the wild boar ragu, and it was really the only misstep of the evening (and why it's only getting four stars instead of five). It was uninspiring. At any other place, I'm sure it would have been fine, but because everything else up to that point had been so amazing, we were disappointed. \n\nMy mom ordered the gnocchi with gorgonzola, pine nuts, and asparagus. When she ordered it, I thought \"Why is she ordering such a bland-sounding thing when there's all this excellent seafood on the menu?\" I mean, I love the shit outta some gnocchi. Half the time, it's what I'll order in an Italian restaurant. It's just that everything else sounded more inspired. \n\nThis was HANDS DOWN the best gnocchi I've eaten in my life, and that includes the 90 pounds or so of it I ate as I ate my way through Italy a few years back. The pillows of dough were like little pillows of butter that melted as soon as you put them on your tongue. This dish was so good that it will make me venture into the Marina--a place that always makes me feel like a Stranger in a Strange Land with it's botoxed women walking their small dogs--just so I can shovel summat gnocchi into my face again. I will return and return for that doughy bliss. \n\nWe would have stayed for dessert except there was some Marina douchebag sitting next to us who was telling the table on the other side of him all about his trip to Rome. Loudly. He was so Bob the Boorish American that we decided to flee back into the Mission and get some ice cream at Bi Rite Creamery instead. \n\nAnyway, this place rocks.

The reviews were good and the menu looked delicious so we made a reservation off of their website and off we went!\n\nAppearance: The outside of the restaurant is lovely. There were beautiful white lights strung outside the restaurant and brick lined the entranceway. Once you walk inside, the \"host/hostess\" is surrounded by white curtains and separates your form the main restaurant. The entrance way is quite small and there isn't much standing room but we since we had reservations we didn't' t wait more than a few minutes for a table .There is outside seating with heat lamps but it was pretty chilly that night so we opted to sit inside. We had, in my opinion, the best seat in the house. It was a cozy table right by the window that had a chair on one side and booth on the other(the whole restaurant is lined with long booth seating along the wall and then inner part of the restaurant are square tables that can easily be pushed together for larger parties).  The brick walls are beautiful inside the restaurant and the dim lighting just really creates a romantic mood. It's a wonderful date night place to go.\n\nSERVICE: We were immediately served water and bread with a yummy basil pesto dipping sauce. The only downside was the bread was cold but it still tasted great. We perused the wine list and saw that they served half bottle of wine(around $20) and we had about 1  1/2 to 2 small glasses each. I had a hard time decided between two pasta dishes and so I asked the server for his opinion. He gave me an honest opinion about my first choice and recommended a different pasta dish and also suggested I change the type of pasta that was used. I love that he gave me another option as well and his opinion on my original choice for dinner. \n\nFOOD: They menu is had so many options (enough so that we want to go back but not too many that we couldn't decided) but we each got a pasta dish.  My fianc\u00e9 had ravioli with mozzarella and prosciutto and I had the abarrita pasta with shrimp and substituted the penne for linguine at the suggestion of the server. The portions are huge but it was so tasty we both cleaned our plates. We never get desserts at restaurants but we saw another couple get a warm molten chocolate cake with hazelnut gelato and raspberry coulee and couldn't resist. It was delicious and I would highly recommend getting it.\nBottom line: Our water was always replenished, our wine glasses were always full, the food was delicious, the service was great and the ambiance was wonderful.", "author": "Whitney S."}

Reservation was for 7pm, but we made it there early so asked if there was a table available.  They were very nice and gave us an intimate corner booth.  The restaurant's ambiance was nice.  I'm a fan of low lighting, which makes for a great date spot.  The overall service was also excellent.\n\nWe ordered the calamari stuffed with potato and crab appetizer.  I wasn't in love with it.  The sauce was on the salty side and every time I went to cut into my calamari the stuffing squirted out.  Yum.\n\nFor entrees, I ordered the ravioli and the boy ordered the seared ahi tuna over risotto.  My dish was too salty.  I LOVE salty food, but this was a bit much for me.  I think the Buffalo Mozzarella and Prosciutto combo made it extra salty, which is too bad.  Raviolis, cheese, prosciutto - what's not to love right?!  \n\nHis ahi tuna, on the other hand, was fantastic.  Loved, loved, loved it!  It had a lovely black peppered crust and the risotto was delicious.  I hate when someone else scores a better dish than mine.  It makes me cry inside with envy.

The owner was working the door and was very accommodating. My timing could not have been better as I noticed people filing in for their reservations while I enjoyed a glass of wine. \n\nI started with the Caesar with fresh Dungeness crab - excellent flavor. I recall a light, lemon dressing that wasn't too heavy (like a typical Caesar dressing). I followed this up with Gnocchi con Gorgonzola e Pinoli - magnificent. I was so pleased with this dish. I find gnocchi can go either way - tough and chewy or light and delicate. These bad boys melted in my mouth and reminded me of the gnocchi at Pellegrino's in NYC.

I mean I guess??\n\n2-  We had empty water glasses for about 30 minutes of our 2 hour dinner\n\n3-  We were at the place for 2 and a half hours (waiting and waiting)\n\n4-  We were almost run over by the numerous waiters and bussers.  I felt like it was a race or something.\n\nSo in conclusion, the service was horrible.  The staff was nice/friendly, but the service was just horrible.  I can't emphasize it enough.\n\nThe food, however, was good.  That is what saved this place.  We split a Caesar salad with crab.  It was fabulous.  The bread was OK but the pesto olive oil dip was delicious.  I had the farfalle pasta with crab and asparagus.  This was a tad salty but pretty good.  We all split the chocolate cake with hazelnut ice cream.  This was also delicious (but it wasn't warm, unfortunately).\n\nAlso, they have a great wine selection and quite a few for under 40 bucks.  We had a bottle of Petite Syrah from Russian River Valley.  It was pretty darn good for $34.\n\nSo, I would NOT go back here on a Friday/Saturday night.  I do, however, want to go back here for their pre-fix meals.  It's on the menu and is $25 for your choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  The catch 5-6pm only.

My boss takes us 4 of his employees out for dinner every month and it was my turn to pick. In search of a great seafood place I decided to take into consideration yelpers' reviews. Boy, do I regret it.\n\nFor one, the service was below average. They are very warm when you walk in, but then it goes downhill. We were seated right in the middle of the restaurant and our waiter bumped into my 3 times without an excuse me. We got there at 6:30pm and it wasn't that crowded. I counted 7 other parties and the waiter did not have to rush so much to the point where he couldn't say excuse me or sorry. He did not come by once to ask how things were going. Maybe we didn't get the service I wanted because we weren't business professionals or old people. Either way, I was greatly dissatisfied. \n\nNow onto the food. \n\n-One thing I didn't like was that the prefix meal is only available from 5-6pm, according to their menu.\n\n-The four of us ordered the oysters and a shrimp appetizer (I don't remember what it was called, my boss ordered it). The oysters were average. I was dissatisfied with what they put out though. A couple of the oysters were pretty much just shells. The other appetizer was OVERLY salted to the point where I had to spit it out. \n\nI had a taste of my bosses scallapini, and that was the only thing I enjoyed on the menu. Very well cooked and just enough acid, a little too much salt.\n\nAfter hearing the waiter tell us the specials, I decided to go along and got the halibut. Very bland. No taste at all. I would figure there would be a little....ANYTHING. But there was no seasoning at all. \n\nOne of my other co-workers ordered the short ribs and they were ok. Very tender but there was not that much flavor. Maybe because I didn't dip in any sauce though. \n\nThe night ended with the Tiramisu, and well, disappointed again.

The calamari tubes stuffed with a crab and potato filling were also excellent. The stuffing was a light-as-air puree of potato with rich, sweet crab, and the dish was served with a rustic and deeply flavorful tomato sauce that nevertheless did not overwhelm the delicate seafood.\n\nFinally, I had the sand dabs, a classic San Francisco dish.

I have had sand dabs in several restaurants in this city, and none were better than these.\n\nI remember splitting some desserts with my dinner companions, but  nothing memorable.

The olive oil they serve when you arrive has some odd green something inside. It doesn't taste very good and kills the olive oil taste. The bread isn't so great either and the portions were small. \nThe dish was portioned perfect for me BUT I'm a very small eater. The person I had dinner with has more of a normal appetite and he was hungry when we left. We enjoyed the bread better than the food. The waiter wasn't so great either.

The waiter was friendly; he made a lot of quirky comments and jokes. He went around the table and took our orders without writing anything down. He got all of our orders right. He was helpful in selecting an Italian white wine that would be appropriate for our meals. We ordered 2 appetizers: mussels and calamari.  The mussels were smaller in size but the sauce was good for dipping bread. The birthday girl and I both enjoyed our usual linguine with clams in a white wine sauce. I liked how the pasta was prepared and they didn't skimp on the clams in my entr\u00e9e. I had a taste of the short ribs and the meat was so juicy and tender that it slid right off the bone. \n\nThe restaurant felt smaller because there were so many tables crammed into the space. The tables were placed right next to each other and you can hear your neighbor's conversation. It was a romantic setting with white linen tablecloths, silverware, and wine glasses. There was a bar stocked full of wines located in the inner corner of the restaurant. Stacey C. was nice enough to share with the rest of us her little tiramisu cake with white chocolate slices on the side.

The asparagus was absolutely perfect, but the gnocchi was a bit heavy, and was a bit oily for my personal taste.  The tortellini was good, but overall, the portions were larger than was necessary, and while very functional, the dishes lacked finesse.  For dessert, we split the creme brulee with lemon and blueberries as well as the warm chocolate cake with hazlenut ice cream. The dessert portions were enormous, and while each dish was distinctly recognizable, the taste was simply adequate.  Nothing spectacular.

Every bite we had was incredible, but the highlight was her black cod - *perfectly* cooked. Hot, moist, and just barely falling apart. She wasn't about to offer me a bite. I consoled myself with a venison carpaccio and a filet crusted with a little Gorgonzola.\n\nI lived near Philadelphia for a few years, on both sides of the river, and I was so spoiled by the Italian food there. The usual $20 a plate crap here is just soul sucking. But the food at Capannina, *outstanding*. My God, I might have been in Cherry Hill. The only odd thing was, where's the grappa? Apparently they do not have a full bar!\n\nThe list of Italian wines is extensive, and they are sanely priced. Good Italian restaurants want you to be able to drink some decent wine without breaking the bank.\n\nA few notes regarding the other posts.\n\nThe crowd is older, but there are some 30-ish and maybe late 20-ish diners. If you're going to a quiet Italian restaurant you shouldn't expect to see a bunch of 20 year olds dressed in black. Not sure what to say about that. You won't feel out of place if you look like a grown-up.\n\nWe arrived fairly late in the evening (9PM) and service was pretty brisk, which I thought was a feature (I really didn't want to get home after 11), but some people think otherwise. I was incredibly impressed that our order came out quickly and *perfectly done*. I could wait a little longer but I don't like thinking, where's our food anyway? In any event, the staff here clearly wants to run the restaurant like a business and turn over two seatings a night, *and* go home at a reasonable hour; if you're not into that, come early on a slow night I guess.\n\nIt's a small place, and if you bring a large party, bring it on time. Please don't expect that they will be filled with sympathy if you come an hour late and half their restaurant sits empty in the meantime, and then as you are still jawing over dessert, people with later reservations (many of them regulars) start to wait at the door. A restaurant with solid regular customers doesn't care that much about a party of one-timers that doesn't have its act together, screwing up the reservation book.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-26", "description": "I've been slow to try the host of Italian restaurants on Union Street.  It's a mostly unexplainable phenomenon, too.  I live nearby and I have a pasta fetish.  When Vivian C. proposed Capannina for a fun night of girly gossip, I was eager to accept the invite.  $25 pre-fixe?  Let's just say that all of my co-workers have moved this place way up on their \"must try\" list.\n\nTo extract the most value from pre-fixe menus, I make appetizer and entree decisions based in part on the individual price of the items on the dinner menu.  This translated into the crab caesar salad (regularly $14) to begin and the roasted chicken with kale as a main course (regularly $20).  We brought a St. Supery chardonnay and loved the desserts.  I chose the tiramisu (amazing) but should have ended with the sorbet/gelato trio (superb and refreshing).\n\nThe highlight of dinner was definitely the crab caesar salad.  I've given up caesar salads, mostly on account of them turning out to be nothing more than old romaine lettuce blanketed in full-fat dressing with nasty chunks of cheese.\n\nNot this caesar salad.  It never occurred to me that a light, sweet meat like crab could really class up an ordinary salad so much.  The portion was generous and I'd definitely consider returning to Capannina explicitly for the salad!  The sprinkle of fresh grated black pepper provided an excellent spicy bite to complement the salt parmeggiano reggiano.\n\nThe roasted chicken was huge.  I'm still eating leftovers, two days later.  I ate about half of it.  The roasted potatoes were perfectly salted and very good.  The kale was hearty and perfectly sauteed.  There was nothing exceptional about this dish but the amount of food for the price was very generous.\n\nAssuming the weather is conducive, an open-air table is great.  Just don't linger too long after dinner, or they might come over and ask you to leave because the table is reserved.

We were greeted immediately at the door by our waiter and seated.  Our waiter was so attentive and very helpful.  He gave us lots of detail on the specials and each of the dishes that we asked about, and gave us great wine advice.  My boyfriend got the penne all'arrabbiata with prawns and I got the ravioli with mozzarella and proscuitto - both were incredible.  The waiter came around at least five times to fill our wine glasses and check on our food.

Made a reservation on Open Table and were promptly seated as soon as we arrived. Sadly, I wasn't that hungry so I just got the mushroom soup that was on the specials list. That may not sound like a terribly exciting dinner, but let me tell you -- this soup was TO DIE FOR. My friend had ordered the salmon but after trying my soup, she ordered her own bowl. The waiter was very nice about the fact that I was just ordering soup on a busy Friday night (which I felt bad about). I tried a bite of my friend's salmon and didn't think it was amazing so I am hesitant to give the 5 star rating.. but I will definitely be going back to check out more of their food.

The tuna carpaccio was absolutely exquisite but my major complaint was the service. I don't know if our waiter was having a bad day but he was truly awful! We came in late Saturday for a nice relaxing meal and right off the bat treated like we were lower class. We hadn't dressed up but there is nothing about our appearance or mannerisms that would make anyone believe we are unable to pay for a meal.  It took the waiter 30 minutes to finally acknowledge us , we order wine, an appetizer and dinner entrees.  The entrees came and albeit they were delicious, they were luke warm and looked as though they had sat under a lamp for a while. I am not one to complain at restaurants due to my history of waitressing and common courtesy but I should have. He never smiled at us and honestly treated us like we were common trash, we had to set our credit card on the table while he spoke with waiters in the kitchen for him to realize we had finished eating 25 minutes prior. I will go back one more time, if the service is bad again I will speak up and probably not return because it honestly can ruin your entire experience. All and all it was great food but awful service, lesson to that waiter don't judge a book by its cover or you get tipped 15%.  I served all through college you always get 20% or more with me, fail!", "author": "Katie A."}

I had the black truffle risotto with scallops and lobster bisque. absolutely phenom. Really perfect consistency el dente. And the scallops were seared to perfection, seasoned nicely.  I then had the prociutto ravioli with mozzarella and garlic chips. it was also absolutely delicious. The garlic chips added such a perfect mix of texture and flavor the ravioli tasted very homemade and the sauce was one of those light savory perfectly seasoned tomatoes sauces that has you using bread to get the last drops. The only thing was I couldn't find one bit of procuitto in the ravioli. But I wasn't bothered bc it was so tasty. Gets crowded I would recommend a reservation. I walked in right when they opened (first person there) but in 45 minutes the restaurant was packed (5:45). Service was amazing. Waiter was perfectly attentive even when it got busy, and charmingly italian. Enhanced the experience --he was really so nice. Slightly pricey meal for one was apx. $35.00 but I wasn't worried about price I got what I wanted, so if you shared and went for cheaper things you can make it affordable.

Worth the higher price range if you want a guaranteed fine Italian experience. The staff is friendly and authentic and VERY professional. My first time I had the mixed seafood grill which included perfect portions of both salmon and a white fish and two HUGE prawns- very tasty and not overcooked, which I worry about when multiple seafood items are in a dish. My second visit included the clam linguini, which had a good amount of clams in it and perfectly cooked pasta. The appetizers are all amazing, but small, so if you have more than two people who probably need a few. The tuna and beef carpaccio were both savory and accompanied by sauces that really complemented them without being overwhelming. Extensive wine selection. I've sampled the chocolate cake, tiramisu, creme brulee, gelati and sorbets, and profiteroles - we had a large table ;) - and they were all good.

My wife and I are from Connecticut and were visiting my daughter this past weekend. We had our last meal together at Capannina Sunday for dinner. I only wish we had all our dinners there for everything we had there was delicious, well presented and quite bountiful in its' portions. We arrived there a little before 6:00pm and my wife & I were thus able to order from the price fixed 3 course specials that are available from 5:00-6:00pm. We both ordered the salmon dish along with Caesar salads with crabmeat. For desert we had our pick of every desert on the menu. We additionally ordered their black squid ink risotto with scallops as an appetizer for each of us. My daughter ordered the veal scallopini. We all tasted everyone's dishes & deserts and all were \"sublime\". This is truly a superior restaurant with very reasonable pricing and a very comfortable atmosphere with very professional staff. I felt that all the other restaurants we dined at were nowhere  as good as this particular gem. Even though they were crowded with diners, they were overpriced and their cuisine wasn't close to Capannina. I can't wait till we're in San Francisco once more so I can try their Cioppino which a diner next to our table had ordered. It looked magnificent and the diner said it was delicious too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-27", "description": "So I was in the Marina pretending to shop at BCBG when my friend and I grew hungry. The shops and restaurants were pretty dead for a Thursday evening except for this place which was conveniently close by. That was a good sign. The restaurant itself had a clean modern look, good dim lighting and a well coiffed clientele. Another good sign. So we gave it a shot and I've been reminiscing about the food ever since.\n\nI love it when I stumble onto a restaurant and leave beaming with sheer food joy. This is when the food, wine and ambiance come together so well, that each bite must be followed by a modified happy dance. \n\nFirst off, the service was a little awkward. There is something about Italian service that I still haven't quite gotten. It lacks any sort of intuitiveness.  After waiting for 15 minutes (and it wasn't busy at all) the server asks if we want various kinds of water and we were thinking, um, we would like water, wine, and the entrees we've decided on.  So we asked if we could order. Who needs to do that? Weird. Not only that but i knew that once we got our food, he would probably not come again for another hour at least .\n\nBut Sergio prevailed! He was an older, more formal server but after asking him for his recommendations and embarrassing myself by butchering the Italian language, he was actually quite friendly and attentive. His wine recommendations were excellent. I haven't had such a pleasure drinking wine by the glass in ages. The Montepulciano and Campania wines worked wonders on my taste buds. \n\nThe food courses came slowly, but this is typical of real Italian establishments. The mussels in saffron sauce was sadly over salted. I think they messed up. The mussels were cook well, but the broth tasted as if 3 cooks added salt to the broth not knowing it had already been seasoned. But when my entree arrived, all was forgiven. \n\nI ordered the sea bass with crab ravioli. It is the best entree I've had in years. This is where I did my modified dance of joy where I shimmy my booty in my seat and stab the air with my fork. I do this after each bite. I'm that weird but i was so ecstatic! The sea bass was cooked to perfect. Succulent, moist, clean, and fresh tasting with minimal seasoning. The skin was so crispy and savory, that I was reminded of bacon. Sea Bass bacon! if there ever were such a thing, I had it. Under the sea bass sat the crab ravioli. This is not your average ravioli. This was one thinly wrapped pocket of moist, flaky, sweet crab meat. It was amazing  and so beautiful to look at. I ate it slowly to savor each bite and I never eat slowly. There was a spicy tomato broth layered around the plate accented by baby manila clams, otherwise, there was nothing to compromise the clean flavors of the fresh crab and sea bass. I can't tell you how good this dish was. I would go there just for the entree time and time again. I want the recipe!", "author": "TaDao V."}

It really felt crammed in there, but it was more of a quaint, family feeling.  That's good because I came with my hungry run club family.  The waiter was really entertaining and suggested a wine for us and also took our order without writing anything down.  I can't even remember what I was wearing and he memorized 10 dishes!  \n\nOur table had some good-looking and tasty food.  I stuck to my predictable dish - linguine alle vongole - my favorite.  I get it in every italian restaurant.  I should really branch out, but it's my fave!  Apparently, it's Candace F's favorite too because she ordered the same thing.  We couldn't stop making yummy noises when we were eating it.  Others tried short ribs, ahi tuna, salmon, and veal.  The dishes were really good, but the tuna was supposed to be seared and was a little overcooked.  We also ordered mussels and calamari appetizers.  It wasn't the normal fried calamari a lot of restaurants have.  It was about 6 pieces of cooked large stuffed calamari on top of one giant slice of bread.  If you have a large party, I don't know if I would recommend eating this.  It's good, but with only a few pieces, you need to split it somehow.  Overall, really good food.  Even the bread with pesto was good.  We all stuffed ourselves on the pesto bread first.  \n\nWe opted to skip dessert here to try Yogurt Bar around the corner.  But since it was my birthday, suddenly the owner and our waiter came out singing Happy Birthday in Italian and surprised me with a tiramisu.  Did I mention how nice the staff is here?  They make your meal a delight and makes me want to come back.  But the tiramisu... mmm... some kind of wonderful.  It was so moist and had white chocolate slices surrounding it.

This is a great place to try some dishes you can't find easily in SF.

Capannina had promised to take care of us despite the large group, it was a case of overpromising and underdelivering overall. Yes I understand that the tables are income and need to be turned over ASAP...in any case, Capannina is prob not a place for larger than 4 people to dine in my humble opinion.\n\nFood is great there, especially for Italian in the city.  HOWEVER the service leaves a lot to be desired.  Granted we went there in a large group (20+), made sure we were there for an early reservation, and we were rushed the whole time to the point that we were served a cake that was brought by a friend and asked to box up the cake and take home instead of actually eating it at the restaurant.

I don't usually care for gnochhi, but ordered it anyway because it sounded interesting, and found it to be the best gnochhi I have ever had - very soft with a great texture.  The owner is very friendly without being overly intrusive, and brings everyone a limoncello at the end of their meal (at least he did last night - I don't know if that's a regular thing or not).

That said, they could probably hire one more server and spread the load a little. Their web site is not useful and as a vegetarian, I'm loathe to try a place without reading its menu on-line first. But it's Italian so I assumed there would be at least one meatless dish, and it has great reviews on Yelp - so off we went. \n\nHad a terrific wine: 2003 Valpolicella Ripassa Zenato, a little jammy but not cherry-ish (and I am by no means a wine expert).  Started with one of the basic salads with a lemon vinaigrette. For the main dish, I had the gnocchi with mushroom sauce  and asked to put the wild boar meatballs on the side for my fiancee (who is not veggie).  The gnocchi itself was cooked perfectly - not too soft or firm. The sauce had a wonderful earthy flavor. It was a little salty, however, because they didn't account for the meatballs being excluded. My fiancee had the buffala mozzarella ravioli with pancetta.  The buffala mozzarella gave it a rich and creamy texture without being heavy; the pancetta was understated (though she raved about the wild boar meatballs from my dish). Overall, she enjoyed it.  For dessert, we ordered the homemade tiramisu. Easily one of the best, if not best, tiramisu I've had in the Bay area. \n\nParking, btw, is tough to find in this area.

I reccommend it to everyone who is looking for authentic italian in the Cow Hollow Marina area.  The food is excellent, the Crab Caesar is a smart twist on a classic, and the Buffalo Mozzarela, which is paired with Roasted Red Peppers and Proscuitto, melts in your mouth.  The Sandabs are incredible, and the risotto served with the Veal Scaloppine will have you be craving it well after you leave.  Finally, if you love dessert like I do, you HAVE to try the Custard filled Profiteroles, there are something like 6 of them, enough for a whole table to share, and they come with chocolate & caramel dipping sauces. Trust me on this one.", "author": "Sara Ann S."}

It would have gotten five stars, but as they were (at the time) getting their beer and wine license renewed, we had to make a side trip to the liquor store to pick up a bottle of wine....  what was i talking about??? oh yeah, the food.  It was great.  I had the sea bass that was perfectly seared and still so moist and flavorful.  It had a couple of great sauces and some israeli cous cous to complement it...  honestly, i was not expecting the meal that i got.

The food was wonderful!\n\nYou get your standard pesto and bread at the table as your waiting for the rest of the food to arrive, the pesto was fine, nothing special though, and I don't understand why nice restaurants insist on serving their bread cold? it would have been so much mor enjoyable toasted a bit. Luckily, the rest of the meal was better.\n\n We had the stuffed calamari (my favorite thing all night!) to start, this deserves 5 stars! It was filled with potato and crab, it was creamy and the spicy marinara with it added the perfect amount of bite to the mellow creaminess of the stuffing. It was followed by the squid ink risotto topped with scallops, I thought it would taste more exotic given the ink, but it tasted like a typical risotto, actually I like my risotto not so stiff, it was tasty but not over the top. For the main course my husband and I split the salmon over zuchini and olives. The salmon was cooked very well, perfectly flaky and moist.  The saltiness from the olives added a lot of flavor, but there was'n't enough olive to fish ratio so the fish without the olives lacked salt. For desert we had the warm fruit tart with vanilla gelato, the presentation was beautiful (i wish i had taken a picture!), the tart was a pear and apple mix and a decorative caramel sugar arch on top (it added good texture). Tasted like a upscale apple pie a la mode, YUM!\n\nI had a good time, the wait staff was attentive, and the venue was warm. Although it was very LOUD, a few groups had come and were obviously having a good time, but it kind of detracted from trying to have an intimate dinner.", "author": "Aliya Y."}

The fennel salad did not have any greens and so it fell short for me.  The apple slices were delicious but it would have served better as a topping or fixings of a green salad and not alone.  The Pappardelle with Mushrooms and Wild Boar Ragu was excellent. The main course was a sea bass in a delicious saffron sauce. Although it was delicious, I've had comparable for a lot less money.  The dessert, Warm Chocolate Cake,Hazelnut Ice Cream &  Sauce was fantastic.  The two winners were the pappardelle and dessert.  I'd go back just for the pappardelle and their pasta next time.

I'm always looking for places to try ciopinno and this restaurant has one of the better ciopinnos around. I went here a few months ago and now as I write this review, I think its time that I go back again for dinner.\n\nThings I enjoyed:\n- Service : the waiters here are SO friendly.  The first time I went here, I thought the waiter was faking his accent to make the place sound more authentic...but no, the accent is real. The hubby and I were in Italy a few years ago and the waiter was chatting us up about places in Italy he's enjoyed and other places we should try. He could have totally been making things up b/c we just did the touristy things there, but hey, it sounded authentic.\n- Atmosphere : the vibe here was fun and relaxing. It was a nice noisy buzz, but not too obnoxiously loud where you can't hear your dinner companions. \n- Food: loved the ciopinno and rack of lamb. Lots of flavor and perfectly cooked. The ciopinno sauce was great for dipping the bread in too. This dishes were a good portion/size too. \n\nOverall, I'm definitely coming back here again.

The dining room was small but cozy, and the decor was soft with clean lines.  We had hoped to try the calamari stuffed with crab, but unfortunately, the patrons who were seated right before us ordered the last ones! We tried the crab cakes in a marinara sauce and the the squid ink risotto with scallops instead. Both appetizers were excellent. The crab cakes had plenty of crab in them, and the scallops were perfectly cooked. The risotto was also prepared well and not overly mushy. For our entrees, we ordered \nthe veal scallopini and the halibut with crab ravioli. The veal was very tender and the lemon caper sauce was refreshing but not overly tart. Our halibut was very fresh and delicate. I thought that the crab ravioli was especially good. It consisted of crab folded within a thin\npasta without (thank goodness) a heavy sauce to overwhelm the subtle sweetness of the crab meat. At $21 and $24, our entrees were reasonably priced and generously portioned, especially given the freshness of ingredients and quality of preparation. Despite already being full after two courses, we forged ahead with dessert. We ordered the classic italian tiramisu as well as the panacotta with poached pear and raspberry sorbet. The tiramisu was very good--light and creamy with a nice espresso flavor. My favorite, though, was the raspberry sorbet, which was the perfect balance of sweet and tart, and a refreshing complement to the rich and creamy panacotta. Overall, we had an extremely enjoyable experience at Capannina. Even though we had read many of the positive comments posted on Yelp and had high expectations for this restaurant, we were not \ndisappointed! We were extremely impressed by how even the quality of the dishes were across the menu and would gladly recommend this place to friends and family as one of the best italian restaurants around!", "author": "Yb W."}

That said, it did not feel like something we could not make at home.  \n\nPasta with wild boar was interesting (recommended by waiter), but reminded me too much of eating pasta with meat sauce, except this was more greasy.  It was tasty, but very little to \"wow\" us.\n\nBeef Medallion with Gorgonzola - again, a suggestion from the waiter, and while it was not bad, and we both felt that the meat was a bit mealy.\n\nService - was great, everyone was friendly and helpful.  Perhaps the best part of the restaurant. \n\nIn summary: an enjoyable experience all in all, but when we spend $60-70 per person (with wine) for a night out, we want to walk away thinking it was special enough to want to return.\n\nSo far for our money, Delphina is still the place to beat.", "author": "michael d."}

You first see its awning, then the bright, cheery lime-colored room.  The host is fidgeting here and there, making sure that everything is just so.  My server is at attention, poised, ready.  \n\nFirst comes a large portion of not too good bread.  With all of the first-class bakers in the bay area, this is a bad omen.  A crab cake is served with micro greens in a lobster vodka sauce.  The greens are just a few sprigs atop the crab cake, but fresh and tasty.  The lobster vodka sauce is assertive and together with the fried breading somewhat overpowers the crab.  The filling itself is fresh, and if somewhat overwhelmed, tasty.  Pappardelle with mushrooms and wild boar ragu is piping hot, and properly al dente.  Here there is a matter of one's taste.  For me the sauce seemed too acidic, overwhelming everything else on the plate.  For you perhaps the dish might seem assertive.  My main course  is veal scaloppine with lemon-caper sauce, spinach and parmesan risotto.  The veal is the real thing, crisped here and there but the lemon-caper sauce overpowers.  The spinach is nice, studded here and there with pine nuts and raisins. The risotto is overdone, watery, and seems like a side of rice with delusions of grandeur.  \n\nThey try and care here.  A bit of restraint in the kitchen and ... well you know.  I leave thinking back to my first visit to San Francisco some thirty years ago.  To Vanessi's on Broadway.  What they did with veal.

Yes, I know you want to turn the tables faster, but it provides a schizoid personality to your restaurant:  elegant food and service vs frantic service.\n\nDinner for two, with appetizer, main course, dessert and a glass of wine:  $100 plus tip.

My review is long overdue and I can't believe I haven't yelped it yet.  My girlfriends and I shared a number of fabulous dishes that were really tasty.  We started with the broccoli rabe and burata cheese--the rabe was perfectly cooked and the cheese was really amazing, oozy goodness.  Then we had the ravioli with white truffles (they currently have a special truffle menu--worth the indulgence!) which was also very yummy with the earthy truffles.  We followed that with the carpaccio--again with white truffles!  The regular carpaccio is so good I've had it at Capannina a number of times, but the special truffle version is a nice change.  I think we followed that course with the linguini carbonara with white truffles.  I'm a carbonara fan and this version was spectacular.  Perfectly creamy and the scent of the shaved truffles was heaven!  Then came the veal scallopini (my favorite--I've had it at least 3 times) which is served with risotto and spinach--don't you love it when all the sides are good?  Although we were stuffled (we did share all of those apps and entrees), we shared the pear tart and the profiteroles.  Both were excellent desserts, as always.  The service there is always attentive and we enjoyed the wine selections as well.  Thank you Capannina!", "author": "C. Ann B."}

Many dishes are creative and different or have a slightly different twist; during a recent visit I enjoyed a Caesar salad studded with freshly cooked seasonal Dungeness crab, and pan-roasted sand dabs topped with a sauce featuring shaved truffles. My guest had the cioppino, which comes with a grilled half small lobster and a savory broth. As a starter, the calamari was excellent, sauteed to tenderness and served with a tomato-based sauce and a green pesto. The wine list has good representation for every region of Italy. Arriving on a Friday night at 7:30 PM and finding no parking nearby, we asked the owner if a valet was available (they don't have one) and he responded by pulling their sandwich sign out of an on-street parking space right in front of the restaurant, which we then used. We enjoyed speaking Italian to our Neapolitan server, who was attentive and friendly. The house was packed from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, so reservations are essential, and customers tend to linger.

The service is wonderful. We were going to be 30 minutes late for our reservation, so I called, very reluctantly, to cancel and they offered to move it instead, no problem. The servers were incredibly friendly and funny. We had the peach salad and burrata to start. The burrata melted in my mouth, almost eclipsing the sweet tenderness of the fresh tomato it was served on. The plates were also beautifully arranged, something I rarely notice as I inhale food, but was impossible to miss at Capannina. My buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto ravioli was like I had created the recipe in a dreamworld: incredibly tasty and perfectly cooked, combining all the Italian ingredients I like. Finally, the proffiteroles. Nothing can really be bad when it comes with fudge and caramel dipping sauce, but these were perfectly portioned pockets of sweetness. Two appetizers, three entrees, one dessert and a bottle of wine for $150, tip included.

I now have two dining experiences under my belt and I must say, the food is fantastic!  It's not cheap, I'll tell ya that right now, but you have to go for the food.  The first time I came, I'd made reservations, the other two times, I've braved it as a walk-in.  If you don't have reservations, it can be very frustrating.  First of all, it usually takes them awhile to acknowledge your existence, even though they're constantly pushing their way past you to serve other tables.  When the host finally does get to you, he will probably say, sorry we're all full tonight...meaning what?  Not a single table will be opening up for the rest of the night?  I can't put my name on a wait list and come back in an hour?  What about the bar?  Do you not allow for the occasional walk-in?  Anyways, because of this response, I left the second time frustrated and fighting off my Capannina craving.  The third time, I was a bit more adamant.  He finally said, well, I can seat you outside (brrr!) or at the bar (perfect!).  We had a wonderful experience at the bar!  In fact, I would probably prefer to sit at the bar from now on.  We were waited on by a gentleman named Alejandro who was extremely friendly and attentive.  I first ordered a glass of wine and he asked me if I'd like to taste it before pouring a full glass.  Thank goodness I did because I actually wasn't a fan and he happily recommended something else which I was much more pleased with.  We then ordered a salad that I mentioned we would split.  When it arrived, he had already split it up for us!  It was a simple baby greens salad with goat cheese and walnuts and it was fabulous.  Next, I ordered the black ink risotto w/ scallops.  I'd had this before so I already knew it was a winner.  This dish is to die for and the reason I keep coming back!  The portions are on the smaller side but that's actually a positive thing for me, as I feel most restaurants serve waaaaay too much food.

The olive pesto offered with bread is, as others have mentioned, delicious.  We then got a range of starters -- the special soup of the day, white corn with crab, had a subtle smokiness from the roasted corn that was absolutely delicious.  The two salads we tried -- mixed greens with goat cheese and walnuts and caesar with crab -- were also excellent.  The entrees were similarly solid -- my salmon with pesto/crab crust was meltingly tender and the saffron sauce was a lovely touch.  My friend really enjoyed his papardelle with wild mushrooms and boar, and a side of grilled asparagus ordered by another member of the party was perfectly done, with a delicious caramelized exterior and a just-tender center.  The desserts were even better -- their tiramisu was among the best I've had, and the chocolate cake/hazelnut gelato combo and peach/blueberry cobbler with vanilla gelato that I sampled were also very well done. \n\nWhat really raises Capannina to 5-star status, though, is its incredible service!  Ask for Sergio if you go -- he's amazing.  One of the members in our party has multiple food allergies and is a very tough customer about all aspects of restaurant dining.  We were a little concerned about finding a restaurant that would be able to please him, but Capannina really went above and beyond our expectations!  Sergio was gracious, accommodating, and ultra-conscientious about all of our requests.  He made multiple trips to the kitchen to inquire about the ingredients in each of the prix fixe dishes, to ensure that there would be no allergic incidents, and was very flexible about substitutions to various components of the dishes.  When it turned out that none of the prix fixe entrees were suitable, our guest ended up ordering a veal scallopine from the main menu, with still more substitutions being suggested and cross-checked by Sergio for their suitability.  Upon the veal being served, our guest found it too tough for his taste -- without hesitation, Sergio offered to have it re-made to his satisfaction.  The kicker came at the end, when we found that even with all of the trouble that had already been incurred, the restaurant had been generous enough to count the alternative menu entree as a prix fixe, even though we had expected it to be counted a la carte!  Normally, prix fixe menus are kept very inflexible (understandably so -- that's the whole point), so we were really surprised by their generosity.  \n\nCapannina is a gem!", "author": "Claire O."}

The Veal Scaloppini (being served to the table next to us) looked and smelled fabulous.  We live on the Peninsula and will be back, guaranteed.  Absolutely recommend any one who enjoys romantic ambience, excellent service and good Italian food!", "author": "Michael S."}

When I read these things and someone gives everything four and five stars, I think to myself, yeah right, but this is the real deal.  Great service, great food, not all traditional, but done to the point of wanting more but too full to try.  The wine list is more or less all Italian, but the staff has a grasp on it and can help u out if you are lacking in knowledge.", "author": "AJ L."}

I made a reservation via Open Table, but it turns out had babysitter issues for that night so my boyfriend decided to make a reservation for Friday night instead. I called to cancel my reservation for the 14th  on Friday afternoon (the 13th) and the hostess was very rude. He claims he's left me messages (he left a message earlier that day) and that I needed to call back asap and confirm my reseravation. Started to give me a lecture! Little did he know we had reservations for Friday night instead!  I had my boyfriend cancel our existing reservation and we ate somewhere else.  I haven't even tried their food, but their service was lousy and disappointing over the phone, I could only imagine what kind of service they offer in-house!  If the hostess was nice, I would have kept my reservation and probably would have good reviews. Too bad -- in the restaurant business, first impression is everything.  That hostess could sure use an attitude adjustment.", "author": "Rose V."}

The service, the food and the atmosphere were all excellent.  I had the capallalini which had the best tomato sauce I have ever had - and I used to live in Florence, so I have my fair share of sauces!  I highly recommend it!   Its a great place to take friends or family members.", "author": "kay g."}

The food was pretty good, not spectacular, but it could have been that we just didn't order the \"right stuff.\"  The service however was not so good.  We asked for water and the guy with a pitcher of water in his hand told us to ask our waiter.  We ordered and then had to ask the waiter if there were any specials.  Atmosphere is cool, and some of the appetizers that other people ordered around us looked good, but other than it was a good dinner, but that was about it.  Maybe it will be better next time.", "author": "Marc G."}

Excellent, thanks for a great evening. Only reason for 4, not 5 stars is that they pulled the good old trick of serving a different vintage of my Jordan Cabernet than was listed on the menu. I understand that they may run out, but just say so when we order the wine. Or at least check the year before serving just like you smell the cork.", "author": "Peter J."}

There are so many restaurants to try in the city but we love to come back here alone AND with visitors to the city to show off!  Capannina is a great way to do it.  Very personal and extremely attentive service (very flexible too if they can - they moved our reservation by 45 minutes because of a flight delay with no problem!)  If you know authentic Italian, this is it.  Haven't found a single item on the menu that was sub-par.  It is an intimate storefront size but very comfortable.  One night we didn't make a reservation and sat at the tiny 4 stool bar - the bartender/server was so extremely knowledgeable on wines and their menu.   And... despite having a ridiculous amount of orders to fill at the bar, he was still attentive and even entertaining as he took care of us as if we were family!  Of course the nights we had a table it was 5-star service as well.  Hats off to great service, great food, and a perfect atmosphere in Cow Hollow!", "author": "Ken A."}

We went out for an early dinner arriving around 5:30.  Between 5 and 6 they offer a Prix Fixe choice for $25.  All of three of us picked this and it was a bargain.  A choice of 3 starters, 4 entrees, and any dessert on the menu were available.  I ordered a Caesar salad with crab which was excellent, my wife and son ordered their mixed green salad which they raved about.  Among the greens and vegetables were homemade potato chips which were delicious.  For dinner my son and I both ordered Pappardelle (sp) with a lamb ragout and corn--delicious and a very good size portion.  My wife ordered Salmon with a Potato/mushroom Gratin that she loved.  For dessert we each ordered something different and passed them around.  I had the warm chocolate cake with a sorbet, my son ordered the Tiramisu, and my wife ordered a Creme Brulee with blueberries.  We thoroughly enjoyed all three.  We had a nice bottle of wine and the total bill was $120.  The waiter was very friendly and everything was timed very well.  Overall a very good experience that I would strongly recommend to anyone looking for Italian food.", "author": "Wayne E."}

We called an hour ahead for an early seating.  The restaurant was busy (though not full), but was absolutely bustling by mid-meal.  Some noise, but clearly fine for pleasant conversation at the close tables.  I thoroughly enjoyed my gorgonzola medallion of beef.  I requested medium to medium rare, so the waiter suggested medium.  When it arrived, it was nice, but I might have preferred a bit more pink.  However, it was delicious!  My sister chose the  short ribs on mashed potatoes, and was very pleased -- reminiscent of our mother's Sunday chuck roasts of long ago.  We shared a bottle of Mondavi cabernet, which was passable.  I would have preferred a longer list of half-bottles from which to choose, but this was fine and went well with the beef dishes.  All-in-all, a very nice experience (and we found street parking on Union)!", "author": "Mary W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-04", "description": "We promised to take our friend from Indiana out to a great Italian dinner in SF and Capannina did not disappoint.  Between three people we ordered 1 antipasti, 2 primi, and 3 secundi and we didn't get close to finishing the secundi.  But we still ordered dessert.  The ceasar with crab is amazing and I would order it every time, the dressing is light and not overwhelming and the crab and cheese seem to meld together.  The bread was delicious and the pesto was fine, but not garlicy enough for my taste.  I added salt to it and liked it better that way.   The Penne con Salsiccia e Spinaci was good but not anything special, but I loved the shrimp risotto with saffron.  I think the online menu has some different dishes than what were actually on the menu when we went because the online description of the risotto is not exactly what we had.  I could have just eaten that for my entire meal.  For our entrees we had Sogliola con Carciofi, Scaloppine al Limone, Puntine di Manzo Brasate al Vino Rosso.  The short ribs were good but I think my favorite was the veal, which is strange because I don't generally care for veal.  Our guest was amazed by his fish and it was delicious.  We agreed to share the  Creme Brulee with Blueberry & Lemon and were quite pleased with it.  Also, all of the meal presentations were lovely and the wine list relied heavily on imported italian wines.  The waitstaff was great, the meal came quickly but we never felt rushed.  Many of the nearby restaurants were empty and this place was full by the time we left.  My husband is from New Jersey and he thought the meal was almost as good as what he could get at home.  If I ever need a special place to take people, I will keep this restaurant on my short list.", "author": "Jennifer C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-09-11", "description": "I went there last weekend and overall not very impressed.  I just moved to marina area and is in the process of exploring good restaurants and saw this one quite close by and gave it a try.  We had a reservation and when we arrived, we were arranged sitting at a table very close to the entry.  We ordered some appetizer to share, fig with prosciutto was not that memorable although the presentation was nice, crab cake is quite good.  Two main dishes are quite disappointing, i had pasta with tuna and caper which is the special of that night and overall i think it is not tasty at all, the spicy tomato sauce overpowered the dish could not get a feeling of the aroma of the seafood  & pasta.  my hubby was having a wide pasta noodle with shrimp and that one was slightly better than mine but still lack the punch of a good plate of pasta, it is OK, but not worth the $$.   Compare to the next door restaurant, i love Luisa 's food a little better.  It is more authentic.", "author": "Josephine J."}
