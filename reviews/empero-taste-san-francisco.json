There are BIG tables there where it seems families and large groups come together for events like birthday parties, events, etc.  A fourth of their menu is even devoted to serving groups of people.  I was only 1 person and there weren't any 1-person tables, only 4-person or more tables, so you should definitely BOOKMARK Empero for LARGE groups like Family/Relatives if you want a bargain in SF for large groups!!  However, they also have lunch specials for individuals.\n\nI only ordered the French pork spare ribs($10.98)[reviewers Jason C on December 20, 2017 and Cathy W on April 7, 2012 have good pics of French pork spareribs]  with white rice(after seeing the great reviews on this entr\u00e9e, I was eager to taste it!).  !  After reading the reviews about how much food they gave, I also didn't want to order too much that I couldn't eat.  Not everything's on the menu like iced water, drinks & desserts, so you should ask them if you want those items.  They also have a $10 minimum for using your CC.\n\nAt the start, they also gave me a pot of green tea and a small cup of soup which tasted very nourishing with small scraps of potatoes, carrots, and meat which reminded me of my mom's soups which wasn't just hot water with a few tossed scraps tossed in like most Asian restaurants.  Instead, it tasted like it had been cooked slowly for a long time and the small bits of vegetables & meat were so tender, truly a real nourishing tasty broth-like soup.  I usually hate soups since they're just hot water that fill me up too much before the entrees, but this was one \"soup\" I finished with relish!  This reminds me of what the classic Chinese restaurants were about, not just what was on the menu but a whole dining experience which may have included a pot of tea, mini appetizers, mini soups, mini salads, etc. before your actual entr\u00e9e dishes came.\n\nLet me get on my rickety soapbox about fried rice in most Asian restaurant menus.  I am ASTOUNDED by seeing $8 to over $10 for fried rice in most Asian restaurants.  Fried rice originally as all Asians know is supposed to be about saving last night's leftover rice for the purpose of eating it the next day. Asians are frugal with food and don't believe in just throwing away food.   Well, to \"revive\" or make leftover cold hard rice more appetizing to eat, Asians had to reheat it in the frypan (usually a high walled wok pan to keep the rice from spilling out) with cheap or free ingredients added from yesterday's leftover chicken, meat, etc along with any chopped veggies you saw in your refridge .  If there were no leftovers, you added spam or scrambled eggs, bacon, etc.  And you added butter, msg, salt & pepper and whatever spice you wanted for seasonings.  All of this was made at home for the price of basically NEAR $0 since the WHOLE PURPOSE was to NOT THROW AWAY LEFTOVERS.\n\nBut now at Asian restaurants, you're paying $10 or more for fried rice??!!  OK, I get that they use a lot of animal protein and their rice is fresh steamed (not leftovers), but they should divide the fried rice into 2 groups with one being LIGHT SIDE DISH fried rice which should be just mainly cheap vegetables & seasoning & tiny amounts of meat or just eggs(maybe call it house fried rice) and so the cost should be $5 or lower!!  The other group of fried rice should be ENTR\u00c9E fried rice for people who want all that animal protein & premium ingredients and want it more as a MAIN MEAL, rather than as a side(even though there's already lots of meat in the entr\u00e9e dishes) and THAT'S what should cost over $10!!  To me, it just doesn't make sense paying over $5 for a side that's supposed to be a leftover!!  To me, it's like eating something you could make cheaply & easily at home especially when you have leftover rice in abundance!! :)-  It's like people have lost the desire to cook simple foods and have surrendered their cents & senses(yes, pun) to restaurants & corporations.  I LAUGH and WALK ON BY the supermarket's PF CHANG'S frozen fried rice for near $10!!  LOL  Yeah, like I'm willing to hand over real money just to get FROZEN fried rice with a SMALL SMATTERING of chicken or shrimp!!  \n\n............Back to our regular scheduled program............\n\nThe servers were nice and prompt.  Their French pork spare ribs is very different from the usual Chinese ribs.  The French pork spare ribs has more meat than bone, but the meat is sliced thin to easily eat & cook tender, although you have to make sure to not swallow the small bone part.  .  The texture is slightly crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, sweet but with tangy spices along with the sweetness. And they give you A LOT!!  This was served on a bed of lettuce, a couple of sliced tomatoes & cucumbers.  Even if you only had a light lunch, 1 entr\u00e9e will be more than enough for 1 person!!  There's lots of street parking.", "author": "Frugal C."}

When we make reservation, we expect the two tables to be ready at 7 when we come. But it was not. We prolly didn't get seated at the tables until 7:30!\n\nAside from the disorganization, the food was pretty decent. My family and I order a lot of stuff separately.  The lobster noodle was the best in my opinion! I also love the sizzling rice soup! I recommend ordering the food separately and not the family plan set meal!

Next came the garlic pea sprouts and some stir fried bean sprouts with beef cubes. The pea sprouts were a little older (tougher) but still had a nice crispness to them. As for the stir fry, the bean sprouts were crunchy and the beef was tender - I'd recommend this dish.\n\nFollowing this came our dishes of three mushrooms and tofu and dried bean curd with rock cod filets. Both were good in my opinion, but definitely way too much gravy for both. Following this came our order of mushu chicken. The wrappers were absolutely abysmal in my opinion - stuck together and oversteamed/dry. But where the wraps failed, the stir fried filling was done nicely. This dish was also very hefty for just 6 wrappers. We didn't hesitate to take home the leftovers and simply combined it with noodles for a \"new\" dish.\n\nFor rice, we had dried scallop and egg white fried rice. I found it too true to the name, it only had dried scallops and egg white. Typically, it would also include scallions and the ends of gai lan, which adds a nice fragrance and crunch to the dish. Oh well.\n\nDessert was complementary and it was taro dessert with clear tapioca. YUM. One of my favorites!", "author": "Elaine Y."}

If you're used to \"American\" Chinese food, do not expect a meal at all similar to that. My group came in for lunch and we were seated immediately. Our table ordered family style and the locals with us chose all the dishes. It all tasted very fresh and well seasoned. I think our spread could have used a little (lot) more seafood after noticing all that they serve while checking on here, but I suppose not everyone loves seafood as much as me. My table consisted of people literally from all over the world/country and everyone loved it. All is served on a rotating platform on the table, so make sure your friend across the table is done getting the food on their plate before you start spinning it! Or this could be a very useful tactic in keeping as much of the Cantonese goodness for yourself. Whoever can spin the spinner fastest wins, and everyone else leaves hungry.

Everyone was already here when I arrived on May 16th around 6:30pm. Not sure if we had a reservation, but we were a party of 12 people.\n\n$238 for 10:\n*Fish Maw & Seafood Soup\n*Prawns & Chicken with Green\n*Abalone with Green\n*Clams in Black Bean Sauce\n*Spicy Salted Prawns with Shell\n*Lobster E-Fu Noodle\n*Steamed Queen Empress Chicken\n*Salt & Pepper Spareribs\n*Steamed Live Black Bass\n*Yan Chow Fried Rice\n\nWe got the menu above, but I think we got the French Style Pork Spareribs instead of the salt & pepper and a Whole Fried Fish instead of the steamed one. I actually didn't care for our replacements as I found the french spareribs too sweet. I adore the steamed prep of fish, so I was bummed we didn't get it. It's actually one of my favorite dishes. Out of the rest of the dishes, my favs were the chicken, abalone, and rice. The chicken was moist and silky. The abalone had a nice chew. I also enjoyed the broccoli that came with it. I'm normally not a big rice person, but the yang chow chao fan was fried nicely and had a good amount of shrimp, pork, etc. The salt and pepper prawns were also fried nicely with good savory spicy notes. The lobster was good, but the yi mein was way too soggy. Very mushy. The soup and shrimp/chicken dish were average. The soup could have used some more seasoning.\n\n*Chicken Soup with Cordyceps Flower\n*Ginger and Green Onion Crab\n*Salt and Pepper Fried Crab\n*Chinese Bacon and Preserved Green\n\nSince I come from a family of gluttons, we also added the items above. Both crabs were a good size. I'm a fan of the ginger scallion prep, so I enjoyed that one more. The salt & pepper one was pretty good too. Came with a good amount of fried bits of meat and peppers. I'm not big on the soup or the pork dishes above, so I found both to be okay. The soup was a bit too sweet for me. I'm not into stewed meats, so I found the bacon mushy. To finish our meal, we also got a green bean dessert. Standard for all chinese dinners.\n\nWe bought a bottle of wine to accompany dinner (I believe for $12) and a few bowls of rice, so overall, I think our bill totaled $349.22. Not bad for all the dishes we ordered. Great place for good quality cheap eats.", "author": "Elena N."}

The ingredients are not of the best quality, but the skill and attention to detail shines through. For example the oil used to fry the noodles made the noodles itself very tasty. The noodles are also spread out onto the plate with the meat and veggies in the middle. Instead of a regular dish, it's served in a large plate so the gravy drains towards the middle. What ends up happening is that you get crispy noodles through out the meal as the gravy stays in the middle keeping the noodles crispy. Just this simple technique and plate made this chow mein more enjoyable than places cost 2 to 3 more!\n\nAnother standout was the French style spare ribs. It was a cross between your typical sweet and sour spare ribs and the salt and pepper spare ribs. It's sweet savory and deeply garlicky. \n\nWe also got the clay pot tofu seafood and pork belly with preserve veggies. Both were also prepared well. The fresh lettuce gave the pork belly a contrasting crunch. \n\nIt's awesome to find an excellent inexpensive Chinese place done well. Chef's ability trump all.

It's difficult some times to find parking because of the residential neighborhood. Can we talk about the Engrish of the name though...\"empero\" clearly someone forgot a \"r\" at the end \n\nThe food here is good, and it it a hit or miss depending on what you order. Can't vouch for the entire menu, but will say what we did order: \n\nFried flounder: great! Lightly battered and not oily. Some other establishments you can tell the oil is not fresh due to the color on the item. Here, was not a problem. \n\nGiant clams with noodles: love this dish! It's about $10+ for each giant clam and it's split in half. My mom can make this at home too, but access to the giant clam is not a guarantee. Love that the cellophane noodles soak up all the sauce. \n\nFrench styles pork chops: AMAZING! I definitely recommend this, particularly since I haven't seen it at any other menus. The fragrant taste is attributable to the fried basil.

On special days and the day prior this place gets busy. So busy they service decreases dramatically. We had a party of 30 (three tables), one table never received water like throughout the whole dinner. The only table did not get one of the orders (choy). We ordered three of everything for each table. Of the 7 items we ordered for the three tables, most did not come out the same time so we ended up sharing plates across the able rather than have one table wait for their order. Some took 20 minutes longer than others. Basically, coming here when it's busy mean lot more patience is required. The food is good. The hot plate plate beef, ribs and catfish were the best. The stuffed chicken with sticky rice is very filling and one order could've feed all three tables.

I remembered that the place was empty and my youngest daughter and I went there.  However, the staff just ignored us and we finally walked out.  Now that it is called Empero Taste, we thought it might be different.\n\nAn associate raved about this place and provided her favorites.  We arrived on a Tuesday evening (5 PM) when there were only one set of customers.  The restaurant is clean and well lit.  We tried to order chow fun, but the waitress said they were sold out.  How can you sell out of chow fun this early in the evening ?  It is like being out of rice and chow fun is a staple.\n\nFinally we ordered some comparison foods -  sizzling rice soup ($6.99), mongolian beef ($7,95), house special chow mein ($6.99), honey sesame chicken ($7.50).  Before we had an opportunity to have much soup, the staff brought out all the dishes.  It seems like they should have waited, but they just dumped it on the table.\n\nThe soup had a nice flavor, but really was devoid of anything that would resemble a quality sizzling rice soup, though it did have lots of green onions.  At first they brought the soup, but forgot the rice.  They then brought out 4 squares of deep fried rice and place it into the soup to make it sizzle.  As the waiter ladled the soup, he didn't bother to take the soup spoons out of the bowl.\n\nThe mongolian beef lack any sort of \"hotness\" that you would expect from a dish like this.  Maybe it was made too much for \"western taste buds\".  It did have nice chunks of yellow and green onions.\n\nThe honey chicken consisted of bits of deep fried chicken heavily battered and covered with honey and sesame.  It reminded me of those chicken poppers at fast food restaurants.  As I said, it was mostly batter with only small pieces of chicken.\n\nThe house special chow mein was nothing special.  It consisted of mainly noodles with a sprinkling of calamari, red and green onions, chicken and ham pieces and \"one\" shrimp.\n\nThe service is only so-so and they never came back to ask about the food.  Again, this is a series of inadequate Cantonese places that we have tried, regardless of the good intentions of associate recommendations.  Would we come here again?  Probably not, as their are plenty of middling and inadequate Chinese restaurants to chose from.", "author": "Robert J."}

When an old high school friend invited me to lunch at one of her favorites, how could I refuse?  We were looking for Best Panda, but what we got was worst tasting Empero.  Upon walking up, I noticed something peculiar about the sign.  First of all, it seemed to be missing an 'R' to spell \"Emperor\", but second, the \"M\" in the sign was mounted backwards!  This was just a prelude to the dumpy dumplings we were about to sit down to.\n\nEmpero Taste was having a grand opening special where each of the small, medium, and large plates cost only $1.80, so we decided to order a variety of things to taste.  The problem was that all of my old favorites weren't included in the promotion and cost full price, which was pretty expensive for dim sum.  One of my favorite dishes is the rice crepes with fresh shrimp, which we ordered at full price.  After the first bite into the shrimp, I noticed something fishy, literally.  These were definitely not fresh shrimp and tasted of it.  All of the other dishes, including the chicken feet, spare ribs in black bean sauce, xiaolongbao, har gow, and siu mai were all a bit dry and none of the dishes seemed very fresh or well seasoned.\n\nAll in all, I was extremely unimpressed by the food and service of this restaurant.  Even the baiting by the $1.80 promotion is not enough to bring me back.  When I go to dim sum, I like to gorge myself with all of the great dim sum flavors and great selection, but sadly, neither of those could be found and enjoyed at Empero Taste.

(I don't see the pork belly or the pork chops on the menu online at menupages.com but that's what we had.)  Everything was outstanding.  Seriously, the best Chinese food I've ever had.  This is significant because I'm normally sort of take it or leave it with Chinese food.  If I lived here we would go regularly.  All of it was delicious but my favorite was the pork chops.", "author": "Angell V."}

I go for lunch with my gramps pretty regularly, and he loves the beef brisket with won ton soup. There are tons of variations of won ton soup, chock full of goodies. Also lots of good rice plates to choose from.\n\nCame for dinner here once and got the $78 meal (6 people). I love when I get the chance to order this \"meal\" because you get a bit of everything. Off the top of my head, it comes with house soup (seafood and tofu), black bean clams, fried chicken with shrimp chips, peking spareribs, salt & pepper prawns, Chinese bacon and cabbage, mustard greens, fried flounder and ginger-green onion crab. It was so tasty, the crab was sweet and tender. They gave tons of clams and the clams were very meaty. They were also nice about substitutions; we traded some of the deep fried dishes out. Plus they changed our plates out twice (because it was banquet, plus tons of shells from the crab).\n\nI should mention that for being a Chinese seafood hole-in-the-wall type restaurant, the ambiance is rather clean (kinda cold, if you get cold easily bring a jacket) and the service is pretty good. I would absolutely take guests here for a cheap, authentic Chinese meal.", "author": "Kris Q."}

One thing was for sure, most restaurants were going to be full. \n\nFor this reason, our extended families decided to hold their CNY dinners weeks after the actual CNY date. However, we still brought the kids to see their grandparents the day before CNY. We were pretty full from eating dim sum earlier in the day, and my in-laws were also full from having a buffet for lunch.  We weren't thinking of having dinner.\n\nThe kids, however, were hungry. We thought most places would be full that evening, but my mother in law called this place (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ufEYEDMaaoiFAxw81IlBAw?select=7MZ2pC86Vv0INIm5aEr5rw). Lo and behold, they said a table would be freeing up in 10 minutes, and to get our butts over there to claim it. \n\nAfter scoring a good parking spot, we entered the restaurant, which was packed. One of the servers showed to a small round table that was perfect for the six of us. \n\nThe adults weren't really hungry, so we didn't order anything special or fancy for the kids. (The lobster noodles the other tables ordered, however, looked very good!) \n\nOur order: \n-Braised beef tendon with turnips in a clay pot (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ufEYEDMaaoiFAxw81IlBAw?select=VxW1I-yXONml627FMDsxLg): arrived at the table bubbling. Nice sauce that was perfect with rice. There was more definitely more tendon than meat, but was OK.\n\n-Steamed Chinese Broccoli with braised chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ufEYEDMaaoiFAxw81IlBAw?select=Yh82bmcddnoa-PrjIgYaiA):  The broccoli was good, with no bitter taste.\n\n-Soft tofu stir-fried with beef and snap peas:  This was ordered at the request of my youngest.  A generously sized dish, lots of cubed tofu, and more importantly for my daughter, very saucy to eat with rice.\n\n-Sweet and Sour Spareribs (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ufEYEDMaaoiFAxw81IlBAw?select=L92NZHSqXGs-ilaQSwdZeA):  Stir-fried with pineapple and onions.

The seasoning is just salty enough to cause immediate anticipation for the next bite, but not overly rich to perpetuate an endless search for water refills.

Order Dried Beef Chow Fun, they said probably hor fun all sold out and went to kitchen and came back a minute later and it wasn't and did the Mandarin/Peking Spare Ribs. Both were good, Empero Taste calls the Spare Ribs actually baked. Lots of meat, and the pork chops were meaty. the house soup came in two large containers. Ordered another Mandarin/Peking Spare Ribs as takeout for the Toastmasters club party the next night. One thing strange with their Peking Spare Ribs is that at the restaurant, it's fall off the bone but the leftovers at home does not taste as good as the other leftovers. Even the one at the party wasn't as good as the restaurant. Two waitresses even pack the leftovers for us and bagged it with the takeout order, unseen at any chinese restaurant. We had to wait for a table as it was very busy.\n\nFebruary 21, 2015 which was basically the 3rd day of Chinese New Year. It was busy with lots of take outs, had to wait for table. When we finally got the table, no one cleaned the table even after 20 minutes. So the customer in the next table who knew them helped clean and setup the table and brought us menus. Cannot even find someone to take the order after 20 minutes so basically write the numbers of the items wanted and handed it to the front desk. House soup which was hair sized seaweed, dried oysters, water chestnuts came in another 15 minutes. Then came the House Jeen Mein, the gravy was watery so all the eating plates were flooded so basically the jeen mean became a chow mein again with all that water making the noodles soggy. The fookin fried rice was okay but not much flavor. The Mandarin/Spare Ribs was basically meat with lots of bone and did not taste anything like the one from December 14, 2014. and finally the honey walnut prawns were okay. We took the rice home but they only gave us the box without the free bag. \n\nSo on the Friday night of March 20, 2015, decided to give them another chance thinking it must be them being too busy Chinese new year. Arrived at 7:00PM and the restaurant was all empty except for small tables were full. They told us to sit anywhere and gave us the 10 person table and the other ones were still empty. Same waitress as the first time. Ordered Beef Hor Chow Fun but they said hor fun all sold out, so either take chow mein or jeen mein. I said chow mein and they asked thin or thick noodles, I said thin and asked them for the price as there is no beef chow mein on the menu and they said same price as beef hor chow fun. and then ordered Salt & Pepper Pork Chops instead just to try it. Chow mein came, it did not have much meat and lacks flavor. Then came the Salt & Pepper Pork Chops, there was only the Jalapeno peppers sliced but you cannot find any red pepper flakes or salt crystals. The pork chops had no flavor at all, not spicy nor even a hint of salt. and just like the February event, the meat is full of bones, unlike the December event. So something tells me that either they changed the chef's or they changed both the chef's and the owner. I was checking yelp earlier today but the reviews are still good, probably because the people ordered stuff like shrimp sauce and pork belly, I don't know how anyone can mess that up Oh, I forgot to mention the house soup came in a big bowl, it was water cress except the water cress was rough as other than the leaves, it was stiff and you can't even eat it. We took the pork chops hope and they only provided a box without a bag and said they would bring the dessert sweet soup. The soup never came even after 30 minutes so we just left and no employee was even in the dining room(s). The restaurant was pretty empty on this friday night and they had less people working than in December 2014.  Seems like Yan Yan Seafood Restaurant is better if you exclude the December 2014 visit as that one was more good and bigger than Yan Yan's.", "author": "Vincent P."}

The restaurant deserved the attention as it served high quality, tasty Cantonese cuisine in a pretty quiet residential setting next to the ocean as the beautiful sea breeze and fog rolled in. The chilly nights were magical as you stepped out after eating a killer meal, full, satisfied and happy. Well the original spirit of Best Panda lives and continues on intact in Empero Taste, which is basically the remodeled, updated, Best Panda, with a new name reflecting the passing of ownership from father to son in the same family. (So I was told by one of the wait staff. ) The food is just as good, cooked as well, and with many of Beat Panda's signature cooking styles and best dishes. In fact, some of the dishes are arguably even better than they ever were. I'm also happy to report that Empero Taste also maintains the reasonable price structure that always existed, including the lunch specials. Killer food, great taste. Good prices. What more could you ask for? If you come for dinner, try the three specials plus soup and rice for $20 and make sure that one of your choices is the \"Fried half chicken\". It's wicked delicious and after you eat it, you'll say to yourself, \"dang that dude on yelp really knows how to eat. \" (and if you don't say that, then YOU don't know how to eat!

I've always tagged along for the company, but I hated Best Panda because it was always cheap food that tasted cheap inside a dirty restaurant.\n\nAfter spending a Saturday morning cutting down ivy and blackberry vines from the big trees around North Lake one of our team leaders suggested that we return to that spot on 42nd Avenue and Balboa Street for lunch.  We were all quite surprised that the space is now Empero Taste.  One of the guys peered into the window; the restaurant was pretty busy at the time.  We decided to go in and give it a try.\n\nOur group of 15 broke apart to take two separate round tables as half of our group wanted to dine family style while the other half wanted to just order individual plates.  The big dining room is partitioned into two parts and we had a room all to ourselves.  I sat down with the group ordering individually mostly because I was one of the last people in, and I didn't know what was going on.\n\nThe service started out pretty bad.  We had two big tables and the waiter left us with only one regular menu and one dim sum menu for each table.  It took the waiter over fifteen minutes after we were seated before he brought us three more menus.  A waitress showed up to take our orders a short time later.  The thick large format menu is about six pages big.  The dim sum menu is very extensive too printed on a one-sided sheet of paper.  You simply check off the quantities of your selections and submit the sheet of paper to the waitstaff.  I wanted chow fun, but the waitress said they were already out of fun.  It was only 1:30 PM, and out of fun already?!  I selected the Seafood Pan Fried Noodles instead.\n\nThe service began to pick up also.  While we waited for our food the waiters and waitresses kept our tea pots full and refilled our glasses of ice water quickly.  The foods came out of the kitchen at a hurried pace starting first with the dim sum orders, then the rice plates and finally the chow mein orders.  With the exception of the dim sum every selection was large portioned.  I knew our group worked up an appetite because everyone dug into their food.  My selection was one of the last plates out of the kitchen and it was very good.\n\nThe Seafood Pan Fried Noodles had firm medium-sized shrimps, tender calamari and huge scallops along with a bit of carrot, a few straw mushrooms and some very tender stalks of bok choy in a light gravy served over a huge bed of thin crispy fried noodles that surprisingly had very little oily residue.\n\nI'd like to return next time and sample some of their dim sum along with a few other items.

This place has pretty decent food.  Not bad but not great either. \n\nMy family wanted to take my uncles/aunts with our respective families to have dinner for Chinese new years.  We called in to get 2 big tables to fit everyone so they know we would be eating a lot.  We got our tables but we were short 5 chairs.  Uhhh how are we going to eat?  Servers told us to wait and stand because they didn't have enough chairs.  How can you not have enough chairs?!?!?!  Ok that started off not being a good exp but hey they were a bit busy so I can let that one slide.  \n\nThroughout dinner service, they never once check on us to get us more tea.  When you pound down greasy food, you need tea to wash it down.  We had 10 at each of the 2 tables so those little tea pots aren't going to be enough tea for everyone. \n\nGrr so now end of dinner comes and they said sorry no desert.  WHAT?!?!? ok so maybe no red bean soup at the end .. how about some oranges?  None.  Ok well how about some fortune cookies? NONE!!! omfg and then they add insult by slapping an auto gratuity?!?!?!? Yeah at that point I was pretty pissed.  My dad was just going to pay it but I walked up and had a talk with them.  They decided to let US decide on the tip.  My dad ended up tipping them anyways but honestly I felt they deserved nothing for a tip.  I get that Chinese restaurants usually have bad service but this was unbelievable.  \n\nNeedless to say, I'll never be back here.

We sat near the door, which sucked because it was pretty packed that night.  There were about 2 tables open, but of course they were near the door of the restaurant.  So, every time someone came through those doors, a big gush of wind would go right through those doors.  We couldn't stand the cold so we didn't bother to eat there because for some reason the owner didn't bother to turn on their heat that night. So, we decided to go to another restaurant to patrionize them because Empero taste didn't have eat.  Everyone dining in that restaurant looked like they were eskimos cause it was freezing and they had layers of clothes on!\n\nWe were hear once again for dim sum today.  It was a bit on the cold side, but not as cold as it was a few weeks ago for dinner.  Once again they didn't turn on the heat.  My bf and I looked at the ceiling to check out the central heating and guess what?!?!?

Two dining areas (large flat screen in one of them), pretty good service, okay tasting food. Went here for a large banquet of 40 people. We had salt & pepper crab (overcooked), steamed chicken, steamed rock cod, honey walnut prawns, etc.   Food was mediocre and the portions decent, but there was nothing setting this place apart from other Chinese restaurants. \n\nAs another Yelper has mentioned, the whole restaurant was cold with no heat. They had plastic panels and cellophane on top of their emergency exit doors (which were chained and slide bar locked, against the fire code?) where a glass pane window should have been. It was a really poor make-shift job of trying to block the outside air from coming in, so the cold wind was blowing in all night.   Not a comfortable way to eat, eating in 45 degree temperature with your jacket on. No matter how good the food is, they need to correct that issue soon. \n\nThere were no dishes that I remember as being outstanding and above average.  I would go here again if I was in the area, but it's not a place where we would say \"we have to go again\" and go out-of-our-way to eat there.

This can easily be a 5 star restaurant if you ordered the right things. It's a new dim sum restaurant that just opened up. Heard from Jennifer H that this place was cheap and good. Since I work close by, I decided to come here today with a few of my workers. Brought 5 big guys so that we can sample everything.  There were plenty of seats available and there was plenty of parking spaces outside.  I guess because it is a weekday.\n\nSalt and pepper calamari.........probably one of the best in the city \nXO chow fun............couldn't Taste the XO but the dish was great \nsticky rice in lotus leaf was good \nchicken feet was not good \nhar gow was not good \nbeef roll the noodle was too thick \nshrimp roll the noodle was too thick \npan fried taro was good \nfried taro with xo sauce was good.........had better\nfried tofu was good \nXLB was ok \n2 vegetable dishes \nblack bean sauce spare ribs ok \n\nSo the overall experience was a three star. Adding one star because of the price. You can add another star if you didn't order the har gow, the beef roll, chicken feet. \n\nThe place is very clean because it just opened up.  \n\n1.80 for s m l plates on weekdays only.

They were accommodating -- when we came here the first time with no reservations, they gave us a table anyway. A huge plus in my book. \n\nFood: The steak cube dish IS AMAZING. I'm addicted to it. They don't have anything like that at 8 Immortals.  The clay pot dishes are super good too, and pack a lot of flavor. I usually have to restrain myself from eating a lot here or I'll gain weight.

According to my Asian friends the real name used to be \"good soup\" or some derivation of that and the truth was it was good soup, very good soup. This is a no frills kind of restaurant, or was, it's a bit \"nicer\" now as they painted it, removed the scent of raw ingredients that wafted freely out of the kitchen, and looks like they bought some new plates and what not. Happily the menu remains mostly the same:\n\nDong Po Pork - otherwise known as pork and preserved mustard greens - AKA Chinese Bacon! I ordered this once and the waiter looked at me side long and said \"very fat\" thanks, I know I'm a little chunky, I thought to myself, and then paused to appreciate this guy's concern for my arterial flow. Yeah I know its fatty and I want it, and I'll eat it all right here right now! The pork is out of this world, and its very fatty and the preserved mustard greens on which the swine rests is out of this world.\n\nThe surf clam is a madman, ginger, scallion, little corn starch sauce, garly and slipper bits of clam that are served on an abalone shell.\n\nAll the vegetables on the menu are always well done but especially wonderful are the \"su-choy\" and \"an-choy\" and naturally the pea sprouts which are always bloody pricey but more than flavorful. \n\nThe deep fried sand dab with soy sauce is great. It's a whole plate o' fishy fried goodness that comes straight out of the frier. Very tasty and fun for the kiddies to pick apart.\n\nSalt & Pepper shrimp/spare ribs - oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah... \n\nAll parties are in agreement that the Mu-Shu Pork is orgasmic. It's so good you don't need the plum sauce or the wrappers. I love to eat it just as it comes, by the bloody table spoon full. I'm glad the chop sticks are there to limit the gluttony, it slows me down just enough to keep from choking and allows me to breathe.\n\nIts probably a good thing that I don't live 1 block away from this place as I'd have surely wound up on a gurney or had a stroke from the salt, but this is by far my favorite place for a well cooked Chinese meal that is ridiculously cheap, generous in terms of portions has a mostly friendly staff that understands just barely enough English so that you only have to repeat yourself twice.", "author": "Len S."}

We had the deep fried sanddab (a little dry for my taste), sauteed green beans (getting better) and black pepper steak cubes with scallops (truly magnificent - oh so tender!). \n\nThe restaurant has a clean look and its decor uses expensive materials. There are acres of space here, plus many banquet tables. One con is the service. I found a curly hair in my rice bowl, and asked the waitress to bring me another bowl. Seconds later, my Dad found a hair in his rice! He threw a fit. The waitress rushed over and swiped the hair. She placed it in the palm of the manager, who happened to be walking by. Mr. Manager shrugged and walked away. Yes, this is that kind of restaurant -- if you're not in a group of 8 or you're not a pushy Occidental you'll have to resign yourself to picking hair out of your food.\n\nFinally, the prices are a tad steep.

There's a more friendlier waiting staff and the food is good for another visit! Point to note: it might feel a little tight in some parts of the restaurant.\n\nIf you know what to order for Chinese food, good for you! I'm just going to point out the dishes that are worth mentioning and skip the rest, which aren't bad at all.\n\nThe dish to get is the Bay Fung Tong crab. The crab is chopped up into pieces, coated with a seasoned batter and fried till there's a lovely light crunch! There are bits of minced beef topped over it, but the crab is a winner. There's plenty of crab meat in each piece and the shell is cracked enough to seal the flavor and yet easy to take apart. The batter gives an extra flavor that isn't overpowering to the crab. I don't know if that is their specialty, but it sure is worth talking about! \n\nI mentioned this earlier regarding another Chinese restaurant and it's best to mention it again.

My Aunt and Uncle were feeling extra lavish and doubled ordered for both tables ahead of time, basically 4 group orders, we love food.  AND THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT:  all 10 courses came out within the first 15 minutes!!!!   \n\n     Let's break this down, 40 plates came out before even one plate of food was finished!  Not a joke.  I had then sat in my seat no more than 10 minutes from entering the restaurant and our lazy susan was full, no time to chat or visit with fellow guests.  For those of you who don't know how large a lazy susan is, 20 plates will not fit, I'd say maximum 8 medium size plates.  Yes we double ordered, so adjust, give us a slower plate progression, pretty simple idea.  Don't punish us.  So our waiters stacked our dishes as best they could and what did they do with the rest of the backed up food, they let them sit on an adjacent empty table until there was room.  Who likes cold food?  Not for me.  Not for anyone.  Besides, usually plates come out every 3-5 minutes, everyone ooo's and aahhh's at it, add's a little comment like \"Oh that's my favorite.\"  Nope.  Not this time.  So we munched and munched trying to clear dishes as fast as we could so that those poor lonely dishes on the side table could eventually join the party and hopefully keep a flash of warmth.  They brought out large fish and duck dishes (usually the high points of a banquet meal), saw they could not fit on the susan, and chopped up good looking food and dumped it  on smaller plates to make due.   Spent most of the night quickly chewing our food while playing the most complicated game of Chinese Banquet Lazy Susan Plate Management (not sold in stores) i have ever played.\n\n     Still venting here.  So imagine this scene: we sit, a frenzy of waiters march out an entire ready made feast before we could swallow a single bite, my elder asian relatives attempt to convey their fears and shock, then poof; the servers disappear.  Well easy night for the waiters huh, got that party taken care of, now on to other more important customers with fatter wallets.  \n\n     About the food.  Better than average Chinese food I eat when we go out banquet style.  Walnut shrimp and deep fried pork dishes best, duck little too fatty, fish and veggie dishes bit overcooked, still overall good food.  Main concerns: more salt than I'm used to and later dishes cold for the above mentioned reasons.\n\n     Paranoid, dangerous, politically incorrect thought following:  we have a happa family, most of the White side showed up first.  Could they have noticed this and assumed they could pull this blatantly bad service on us and White people couldn't read the situation?  Boy were they in for an earful when the rest of the Asians showed up.  My family has been dining out banquet style since the Ming Dynasty, never been treated like this.  \n\n     Closing thought: this place could have served the best food ever but if you have the feeling that you are not wanted and are a burden and nuisance to the establishment, you are not going to have a good time.

Now one of my top favorites at this restaurant.  \n\nEverything else is good to very good including pea sprouts that aren't too oily and tasty stews.  \n\nBottom line is if you are in the mood for some solid chinese, none of this fried rice, chow mein, sweet and sour chicken bullshit but real Bay Area chinese, definitely head out to Empero Taste!", "author": "Micah W."}

We were cracking jokes, talking loud, laughing at one of the male relatives that went into the women's bathroom (and didn't care).  When the food came out though, you could hear a pin drop for at least 20 minutes b/c we were stuffing the food down our faces.  We ordered a 6 person dinner and added a few dishes for the eight of us.  Dishes included some of my all time Chinese favs: black bean clams, lobster, salt and pepper fried porkchops, dried beef chow fun, etc.  The only thing left was of course, the veggies lol.  We love this place so much that we will return for the pooled birthday celebrations soon!  On a positive note, this place is fairly clean for being really affordable/cheap Chinese food.  Don't let the price fool you, the taste is not compromised.  I can't wait to tear it up next visit!!", "author": "Steph W."}

There's a lot of staff but they seem to do much of nothing.  The food took forever.  I mean, I go to a restaurant to eat.  Not to sit there twirling my thumbs downing cups of tea for lack of any food to eat. \n\nThey sat us down immediately, but it took them 10 minutes to come take our order.  We had to wave the waiter down to do that.    After our order was taken we were ignored pretty much for the entire time.   35 minutes later and still nothing on the table.  Ridiculous.  No explanation.  I almost thought they forgot about us.  They were busy, but I'm not going to make excuses for other people's incompetencies.\n\nI liked this place.  I really did.  I don't know what the hell happened.  Left a bitter sweet taste in my mouth b/c I enjoyed the food, but the slow paced service is enough to make me never want to return.

Even though we ordered a lot they still joked with us (and not stared disgustingly like I half expected, although I'm sure they're gonna gossip now that we're not there LOL!). It wasn't very awkward, and I have a feeling that if we didn't order so much the service would have been just as good. \nThe food was really good, the one thing I didn't notice in their food was the all too common overpowering taste of salt. Unfortunately the majority of the 'good' dim sum places in San Francisco are pressured into adding salt to their dishes because the 'American' pallet doesn't like anything without salt in it, but OH GOD if you put MSG in it.

Tonight I was finally happy.  The place is still nothing fancy but if you are looking for an authentic Cantonese seafood restaurant for family style eating, this is not a bad place.  The food is tasty and the price is very reasonable.  Most customers are Chinese and many of the special items on the menu are printed in Chinese only.  But the waiting staff and the captain speak English and they seem eager to provide good service.  They have the usual American-Chinese items but if you are adventurous, you can try their goose intestines and sea cucumbers, etc.  In the back of the menu, they also have the prix fix dinner for three, four, six and eight people.  I had their dinner for four tonight which comes with soup, sweet and sour pork, steamed razor clams, seafood stir fry and deep fried squab plus dessert (for $38 !!!).  Since we don't eat beef, we ask them to change their beef egg flower soup to sizzling rice soup with shrimp, and there was no problem.  This is not a place for everyone.
