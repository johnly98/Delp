The food is solid, and the dinner set menus are perfect for group gatherings.\n\nThe variety of Korean dishes are all done quite well. The meats are cooked well and there are a solid variety of side dishes. There are good options for individual order items as well. I enjoy their bibimbab, soft tofu stew, and the braised beef short ribs.\n\nIt's a great choice for lunch specials as well - fairly reasonable portions at a solid price.

My group of 6 arrived at 6:30 as a walk-in to put our name down and we immediately regretted it. The wait was about 1.5 hours + for the grill. We put our names down and just waited outside. After 45 mins passed, we checked  back in to find out that the wait for a grill was STILL 45-60 mins. Turns out the empty big tables with grills that we were all staring at for the longest time were taken by reservations. \n\nAfter an hour wait and still 7-9 parties away, we changed to table ordering with no grill. Within 10 minutes, we were seated.

So much to choose from and so much Ban Chan, that I thought I would not be hungry after the appetizers.  No way though, after I ordered the seafood mix of rice and all types of ocean dwellers cut into bite size pieces.  It was both hot and spicy, just the way I like my food and everything else that matters in life.  The others went for the Bulgogi and Chop Chae which was developed during the Korean war.

Soondobu (Korean Soft Tofu Soup) came to mind and Han II Kwan has been on my radar for some time and endorsed by Yelp. Located in a quiet residential neighborhood in Outer Richmond, parking can be daunting. You may need lots of karma like I did when a car pulled out just in time in front of a busload of Korean tourists. Boy! Did I luck out finding a space and a heads up that Han was jammed with Koreans!\n \nThe meal started off with the traditional array of banchan. Han surpassed most others in variety, all 9 of them, which were mostly flavorful. I've had better kimchi, but the savory anchovies and scrumptious fish cakes were fantastic! The sesame oil marinated bean sprouts and the spicy pickled daikon weren't too shabby either. (4/5) The lunch came with a complimentary bowl of homemade Steamed Eggs (3/5) just like mom's although hers was not the Korean version! Very hearty with rice!\n\nThe main event was Soondobu ($12), which fell a little short. It seemed like the soup needed to cook a little longer for optimum flavor. While a tad bland, (maybe sans MSG), it did hit the spot and warmed me up! Soondobu was a soft silken tofu stew cooked with other vegs (or seafood if you prefer), served in a small cauldron, that infused deep, robust flavors. It was missing a cracked egg where the yolk gave it a bubbling volcanic effect while enhancing the overall flavor. (3/5)\n\nThe next dish was both good and interesting but I was somewhat intrigued by the difficult to pronounce name. Daeji Bulgogi ($23) was a hot plate of thinly sliced pork loin that was blended with soy and gochujang (a well-known, well-loved Korean chili paste) and pan cooked. It was served with a side of lettuce, which was used to wrap the cooked meat. The pork was well marinated, tender, slightly sweet and garlicky. The lettuce added a crunchy texture to the meat and helped tone down its saltiness and spiciness. I thought this was just simply finger licking good! (4/5)\n \nWe finished the meal with something chewy, sweet and slightly slippery! No, nothing from the ocean! It is one of Korea's best-loved dishes.....Japchae noodles ($12)! The noodles were made from sweet potato starch and stir-fried in multi color veggies. It also emanated terrific wok hay, had an addictive sesame oil flavor with just the right amount of garlic. The Japchae noodles had a lovely springy texture and chewy strips of beef.  Who says Koreans are not into noodles like the Chinese? Maybe only just not as much! (4/5)\n\nWe encountered a team of super helpful and cheerful servers.  I would single out Jin as the lady with the sweet, perpetual smiley face.  She was very patient to answer our questions and describe any banchan dishes we were not familiar. The interior was simple and no frills and devoid of any kitschy artifacts. It was old school and designed like an open-air courtyard with pretty blue tiles.  And for the Korean tourists, the food would cure any homesickness and pep them up for the next leg of their tour.", "author": "Geoff G."}

Came here for linner (late dinner) on New Years Day and waited 30 min until we could sit down at 4pm.\n\nVenue / service: restaurant is a bit on the smaller side given how crowded it was that day, with around an equal number of bbq vs. regular tables.  They do have more tables in a more private room, but they didn't use them too much when we came.  It was a bit annoying when they would sit people rather inefficiently (i.e. one person taking up a whole table meant for 4-6); wish they would have used table dividers like they do at some other restaurants.  Service was a bit on the slower side, but I can forgive them since there were fewer servers that day and they were going at a pretty good pace for so few workers on a busy day.\n\nFood: smelled authentic when I came in, tasted pretty good to me!  Meal comes with banchan that you can ask for refills on when you finish them.\n-- Tteok-guk (rice cake soup)($13) - ordered this in honor of the New Year.  Unfortunately, it was a slight disappointment, since the broth itself was quite flavorless.  Everything was cooked well; it just needed a LOT of salt or more anchovy / beef broth flavor.  Weakest dish of the meal.\n\n-- Galbi-jjim (braised short ribs with potatoes and carrots)($27) - super flavorful to somewhat make up for the tteok-guk!  Sauce was rich in flavor and thankfully not too thick, and the galbi was very tender; enough to come off the bone but without being mushy.  Potatoes and carrots were very tender and had soaked up all the juices- I highly recommend dumping the sauce on your rice and eating it!  This one takes a bit longer so you should order other dishes while you wait for it.\n\n-- Bindaetteok (mung bean pancake)($11) - one of my favorite dishes of all time and they didn't disappoint!  My date had it for the first time and simple as it looks, it turned out to be his favorite!  Chewy but still has texture and great mung bean flavor!  These patties are quite big and they give you 6-8 to definitely worth sharing.  \n\n-- Steamed Egg custard (free with meal) - you have a choice between this or sundubu jjigae as a free side.  Very tasty and not overcooked- as simple as it gets.\n\nWith makgeolli ($15), the meal came out to little over $30 / person, which I'm happy with given the size of the dishes and how tasty they were!  This is at the top of favorite traditional Korean restaurants in SF; pity it's a bit far out to get to. T.T", "author": "Audrey H."}

During dinner hours, this place can get chaotic and really busy, so I suggest getting here as early as possible or making reservations. The menu is standard for a Korean BBQ place. There's bibimbap (vegetarian options included), bulgogi, kim-chi fried rice, soju choices, soups, noddles, seafood pancakes, and dolsots of course. The food quality in general was really good and fresh. Prices range from $11-$30, so it's moderately priced. For a group of four we ended up spending about $120. \n\nI must say that one major thing is that their service was terrible! I mean horrible service is pretty standard for most places in SF, so it doesn't really bother me. Just remember do not expect them to cater to your every need. We ran into an issue where the guy calling out the names on the wait list skipped over our name and we had to wait 25 more minutes on top of the hour we already waited on. In addition, one lady should be given an Oscar for her acting performance of passing out just to get a table ahead of everyone else. So be as patient as possible, it is worth it afterwards.\n\nAll in all, food quality is what matters! And this Korean Spot is definitely one of the best and tastiest ones in SF.\n\nTip 1: Only street parking is available, so the parking is bad here! Just uber or carpool with someone else. We took about 25 minutes just to find parking. \n\nTip 2: This place is awesome for groups of 3 or more. The atmosphere, the price, and for the amount of food you're getting, the experience is better shared with a group of people.", "author": "Oliver B."}

I'll commend the service first because our waiter was pretty efficient and checked in on us frequently (questionable friendliness but not so much that it bothered anyone). However, the food was just ok..and for the price, I expect it to be outstanding. The bulgolgi ($27 for a normal size dish!!!) lacked in flavor and was extra oily. The tofu hot pot didn't come with the freshly cracked egg that most places do and again, lacked in flavor. The seafood bibibap ($17 I believe) wasn't awful, but was, again, on the oiler side, and felt like it was missing flavor. The one plus was that it was pretty loaded with seafood so I didn't feel too jipped there. The bonchon (side dishes) are not bad, pretty standard (although they don't include japchae!), favorite was the marinated bean curd slices. They're good about giving refills as well.

We didn't have to wait at all, and were able to be seat immediately.\n\nOnce we ordered we received the (banchan) small plates fairly quickly and started snacking on them, each place was delicious.  We tried several different dishes and each was better than the next.  We had an Oxtail marinated stew, bulgogi, Tofu soup, bibimbap and seafood pancake.  I really enjoyed the tofu soup with the white rice, I normally don't eat white rice but with the tofu mixed with the rice it was like a porridge and mixing in some bonchan bean paste it had the right amount of spicy and salty. \n\nMy brother wanted to order the oxtail stew right away because it can take about 20-30 minutes to make so he place the order right away. So we were able to get the ox tail at the same time with everything else.  Everything was very delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-20", "description": "This is probably one of the best and most authentic Korean restaurants in San Francisco! Been coming here ever since we discovered it upon moving back to SF in 2016.  Previously back in the day, my place was always one of the Brothers restaurants but when we moved back I found that the quality of the food is no longer as good as it once was.  After a few more times, we decided it was time to find somewhere new.\n\nHan Il Kwan is off the beaten path in a quiet residential part of the outer(ish) Richmond.  There is often a wait but during the week, you can usually find a table with a short wait time, maybes 5-15 minutes.  God help you on the weekends.  We've waited an hr before.  There are no decent bars nearby.  Not even good dive bars so waiting around here sucks.  The restaurant gives you the option of both cooking at the table and having them cook it for you in the kitchen.  But if you aren't familiar with K-food, give cooking at the table a try.  They'll help you too.  Note the funny receipt when you cook yourself: \"Cook at table.............$0\".  Lots of LOLZ for this. \n\nThe ladies who work here are great.  From the older waitresses, just the right amount of \"sternness\" you would deserve from the Korean aunties you never had (or do have!).  They don't have time to wait around for you to go the through the menu asking questions.  Peruse, then ask.  Korean BBQ dining is not for chatting or having a laugh with the waitresses unless they know you or you are a regular.    I have found the younger waitresses are more patient, \"nicer\" and speak clearer English (for those of you who have trouble with accents).  Not to say that the aunties are not nice, just stern.  Maybe you need to be past your mid-forties to graduate to a finger-wagging aunty. That said, the aunty waitresses are super efficient and will basically just take over if they see you cooking incorrectly or if you appear to be out of your depth.  One time I took my Dad and he prematurely tried to turn over some Kalbi before it was ready and the waitress [lovingly] smacked his hand with a stern \"not yet\". LOVE THIS PLACE.\n\nI have read that they can accommodate people with allergies which is great, but I would heed my previous advice and try to be as prepared with your questions as possible.  I personally feel that people with self-diagnosed restrictions such as \"gluten-intolerance\" should just expect gluten to appear in most places like this- unless of course they have celiac disease.....or something else that's REAL. I feel most good Asian restaurants in general, unless they are new wave, fusion, trendy or expensive, will not be gluten free or accommodate allergies. So that this place WILL is a wonderful! I've got a friend who self diagnoses herself as gluten intolerant, has to go over each item on the menu WITH the waiter, is particularly picky about \"cross-contamination\" and has to have tamari soy sauce, not normal soy sauce.  I won't be taking her here. \n\nThe food here is excellent.  Admittedly I am no longer adventurous with Korean BBQ bc I KNOWS WHAT I LIKES. I'm just a creature of habit.  The banchan (small side dishes) are just great here and I tend to \"graze\" on those all night long.  They don't give you as many options as some other Korean restaurants, but the kimchi and other various pickles here are legit. Plus they are generous on the refills! They also give you a choice of steamed egg custard \"Gyeran jjim\" or a spicy tofu \"Jjigae\" stew.  You can specify, so if you have a pref, ask.\n\nWe always get a Pajeon \"seafood pancake\" but if you don't eat seafood they have other versions.  I personally love Kimchi Jeon too! I also find it compulsory to order Jap Chae, a \"low calorie\" noodle dish, most aptly compared to eating heaven.  It is not questioned when Jap Chae is order at our table.  \n\nMost importantly, meat-wise: if you are not adventurous or are set-in-your-ways like me, I would recommend the beef kalbi, the daeji bulgogi and perhaps the pork belly if you are particularly hungry.  These 3 choices of meat combined with the other dishes I mentioned is more than enough for 4 hungry people, especially if they are drinking Beer or Soju with dinner.  \n\nLast time we ordered this \"basic\", there were 4 of us and we went home with lots of leftovers.  Keep in mind, we destroy the banchan, ask for refills and wrap out meat in the provided lettuce leafs.   This best way about eating like this is that you get the gristly richness of the meat,  the fresh crunchiness of the lettuce and pickles and the simple steamed rice, which makes for a very balanced combination of flavors.  Of course you have the other dishes as well which gives you some excellent additional varieties of flavours and textures!\n\nHappy eating, you won't be disappointed with this place!", "author": "Adrian C."}

Nor is it the puzzling enigma that is their name (is it Han 2 Kwan or Han 'ill' Kwan?). No, the most conspicuous thing about Han Il Kwan is the gigantic tour bus that is always waiting by its door.\n\nPrincess Carewee and I walk by Han Il Kwan quite often, and witnessing a hoard of tourists being ushered into the restaurant has become quite a regular sight. As #blessed as I have made my life look on the gram, I have actually had some unfortunate experiences in traveling with a tour group. And from these pitiful experiences, I know very well for a fact that these tour groups bring you to the crappiest restaurants in town. Thus, that humongous tour bus always appeared to me as a \"DO NOT COME HERE\" sign.

When we were seated by the booth, we were given the option of having cooked dishes, or doing KBBQ.\n\n\"KBBQ!\" I blurted. \n\nMama ain't raised no fool. There's not a lot for the restaurant to mess up on if the meats are uncooked. The quality may be shotty, but at least I can somewhat control the flavors.\n\nWithin 10 minutes of the Korean small dishes, the meats arrived. The chicken looked tender and soft. And the pork belly, well, that was a marbled-marvel. Colin M. must have saw the surprised look in my eye, so he grabbed my attention.\n\n\"Looks good, huh? Give me 2 to 3 minutes to fix you something amazing.\"\n\nColin placed 2 pieces of the pork belly on to the grill. It sizzled at the touch. The fat oozed out bubbles of oil, releasing an aroma that made my mouth water. After a brief period, he turned it over with the tongs, revealing a side of perfectly charcoaled belly fat. It was a sight to behold.\n\nWhen the meat was finished, Colin placed it on a green leaf of lettuce. He sprinkled some rice, added a dab of kimchi, and wrapped it all up. He handed it to me, along with a shot of Soju.\n\n\"Here. Eat this in one bite. The pork belly carries very heavy flavors, so the Soju serves as a perfect complement to the after taste. I call this, The Lettuce Shot.\"\n\nI put the Lettuce Shot into my mouth. The flavors from the pork belly exploded through the lettuce. The rice blended with the flavor, but offered itself as another texture in the experience. The kimchi splashed in a taste of pickled spice, completing the package. I threw down the Soju shot immediately after. The subtle flavors in Soju is accentuated amidst the saltiness of the Pork Belly after taste, leaving a pleasant sweet sensation. The burn of the alcohol all but disappeared from all the oil of that one bite. It was awesome. The Lettuce Shot was awesome.\n\nSo Colin M. and I spent that afternoon doing Lettuce Shots in Han Il Kwan. It was one of the more enjoyable lunches in recent memory. After the meal, the waitress served us this small cup of sweet soup, which was an ideal ending to such a heavy lunch. I was wrong, so wrong. Han Il Kwan (definitely \"ill\") was great.\n\nI learned an important lesson that day. In addition to never judging a book by its cover (which I do), you should also never judge a restaurant by the giant tour bus parked outside (which I don't anymore).", "author": "Ringo M."}

Thankfully my sister and I occupied ourselves with some beer as the turnover at each table felt excruciatingly slow. The space here is relatively large for SF with a back room to accommodate larger parties. Even such, our tummies rumbled and we just kept sipping on more beer until dinner time.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nSeafood bibimbap: pretty standard but the flavors were robust. The combo of crispy stone burned rice, sweet and hot red sauce, egg, and bits of seafood always wins.\n\nDok boki: simple and ideal as comfort food. The rice cakes were shaped like tubes (as opposed to flattened slices) and incredibly moist and chewy. The sauce was also sweet and spicy, but a thicker consistency to dress the rice cakes.\n\nSeolleongtang: I get bamboozled every time I get this. What looks to be a clear, and perhaps \"lighter\" soup is a flavorful bone broth with large beef chunks, complete w bones. The meat itself could use a longer cooking time as it wasn't quite \"fall off the bone\" just yet, but the taste was there.\n\nBanchan: The darn spread was beautiful.

The staff was definitely pretty busy given how lit this restaurant was, so it took a bit of extra work to flag them down for service. They will cut the meat and get the process started for you (if you do self cook). \n\nWe really, really enjoyed the meat, which was the highlight (and the most expensive!) part of the meal. The kalbi marinade was absolutely on point, and the spicy pork was thin and delicious. They gave alot of fresh, yummy small plates with lots of variety. The seafood pancake was also another favorite: it's much thicker than alot of other Korean pancakes I've had (and not charred at all!). I think the sundubu soup (listed under hotpot!) was pretty small, and the meaty flavor really came through, but maybe it lacked some kimchi? It wasn't the best.  We also got a naengmyeon (cold noodle), but we all thought it was pretty bland, which might just be the nature of Korean cold noodles. \n\nOverall, I'd say the meat was definitely worth it, 100%.

And if you have a large party, ordering here gets you just as full for about the same amount of money as the AYCE places. Han Il Kwan gets their ban chan right. There are so many different little dishes that you can fill up on these alone. And they're all good! My favorite has to be the kimchi with squid, scallions and raw onions. It's drenched in pepper paste so I used it to flavor my ssam creations.  \n\nBut let's rewind and begin with the appetizers. Spicy rice cake good. Seafood pancake good. Japchae good because they added beef and it came out pretty hot still! Usually other places give you the cold version which feels like they bought it at the local market.  Now for the mains! Galbi good. Spicy pork bulgogi good. Pork belly good. Chicken good. Even the chicken was good and I normally refuse to eat chicken at Korean BBQ places out of my sheer pride to only eat beasts with four legs. \n\nThey do let you cook if you have a large party and are ordering a good amount; otherwise they will cook in the kitchen and bring to you on a cast iron skillet.

I never got around to trying it out until just last week. I'm honestly surprised at how late I got around to trying it, as Korean food is one of my favorites. \n\nMy friend and I got to the restaurant around 6pm on Thursday and there were a lot of open tables, however within 30 minutes there was a line waiting outside, which definitely says a lot about a place. We were given the choice to either be seated at a table with a grill or a regular table. We decided to sit a regular table because we weren't in the mood to make our own food and we just wanted to order straight from the menu. \n\nWe ordered the following items:\n\n1. Bulgogi ---Hands down some of the most tender and juicy bulgogi that I've had in my life. The flavor definitely did not disappoint, but I do have to say, for the portion that's given, it's not worth the $24.00. \n2. Soft Tofu Soup (Not spicy) --- We asked to have the soup non spicy which turned out great. The tofu was super soft and every sip was truly enjoyable. \n3. Hot Stone Pot Bi-Bim Bab --- The bi-bim bap was also superb. The stone pot kept the rice and veggies hot for about an hour and continued cooking the rice to crispness at the bottom. It formed the most delicious golden crust and made the dish even more tasty.\n4. Pan Fried Tofu--- I would totally recommend this dish to those who love spicy tofu because the entire top is covered with spicy sauce and spices. The tofu itself was low on flavorful and not really what I wanted, but this may have been because I'm a harsh tofu critic. \n\nIn addition to all the items that we ordered, each table gets little plates called Banchan. These little side plates are all different and fun to try because they're very different than your typical American side dishes. Not all of these mini plates were my favorite, but some of them, such as the Kimchi and marinated cucumbers were AMAZING! The restaurant was also kind enough to bring us the steamed egg dish on the house, which was very nice of them. \n\nI would've given this restaurant a full five stars, however, after we finished our meal and put down both of our credit cards, we received the credit card receipts back for signing purposes and realized that the restaurant had charged each of us the full price... From my perspective this was quite a silly mistake to make, but it felt as if they were testing my friend and I to see if we would just let it slide. Little did they know that we check the bill prior to leaving. \n\nOverall, the food was very good, the service was on point, but that last part (wrong charge on our cards) just threw me off and made me feel somewhat uncomfortable.

Only wished there was more leftover to take home! \n- The japchae that we ordered at my boyfriend's request was a pleasant surprise as well. It's a simple dish that you can get at most if not all Korean restaurants, but honestly not a lot of other places in SF get it to be as good or as flavorful as it's meant to be.

We got there around 5 pm, the restaurant was half empty. After we indicated we wanted to be seated for two. The host who was a tall Korean shushed us to the side, so he can welcome the group of people behind us. I was stunned by how rude he was and did not know how to react. He then told me there will be a 30 minutes wait, he then just ignore us completely and start to bowing to the group that came after us. Never had I seen such servant syndrome and condensate behavior well mix. At this point I left the restaurant and almost feeling embarrassed about being an Asian.", "author": "Jared M."}

The main room was packed and fully seated, but luckily they opened up the next room for us to use. So, yes... we were seated instantly! Woohoo, no wait.\n\nUpon sitting down, our server instantly greeted us and brought us some delicious tea. I don't know what it was about the tea, but everyone enjoyed it. We had to keep asking for refills because it was very nice. \n\nI recently came back from Korea after studying abroad for four months, and being surrounded with Korean food once again brought back great memories. The servers all spoke Korean and English which was a plus because I was able to describe how I wanted my dish cooked with no problem. Our server was very joyful and friendly. She made sure we were comfortable with the menu and introduced some of my friends who are fairly new to Korean food to some of her favorite dishes/popular dishes amongst the guests.\n\nWe decided to order the bulgogi which was very flavorful (serving is enough for two to share). My friend ordered the Seolleongtang which is an ox bone soup. We ordered two Soondoobu (soft tofu soup), one non-spicy, or \"white\", due to my request and the other being normal. My other friend ordered their bibimbap which he throughly enjoyed. Portions were very generous.\n\nTheir side dishes here known has \"banchan\" comes in a variety, varying from kimchi, kkadugi (cubed radish kimchi), myulchi bokkeum (stir-fried dried anchovies), sukjunamul (marinated mung bean sprouts), gaeranjim (steamed egg), etc...  Sangchu(lettuce) was also available. This made the experience the most exciting because not many Korean restaurants serve these type of side dishes. Usually it would just be the simple kimchi and marinated bean sprouts. It brought back the whole Korea feel once again.", "author": "Marc C."}

Head towards Geary for more parking options since more ppl will be coming in and out!\n\nWaited about 30mins(?) for a table of 2. Gotta appreciate their hustle. There's about two main ladies working the front on rotation to get ppl seated as quickly as possible. I didn't particularly mind waiting this time bc I wasn't so hungry, but be prepared to wait if you don't have reservations. \n\nWas craving the soondubu, but theirs has beef broth in it. And no seafood option. So FYI for that. Instead, went with the octopus veggie stir fry, steamed egg, and seafood pancake to share. Their bonchans are SUPER legit here. They come a plenty! \n\nFood was great! Steamed egg dish was massive. Twice as big as I was expecting, and well made. The octopus veggie stir fry was also flavorful and fresh. The veggies were lacking though, but that's korean veggies for you. And the seafood pancake was humongous. Couldn't even get through a third of it! Thicker than most korean pancakes, but again, great flavors - and didn't get soggy in the middle. \n\nStaff came by time and time again to check in. As busy as they were, they always filled up the waters and refilled the bonchans. So why 4 stars?

There were also nine different banchan to pick at while I waited for my food. \n\nThe seafood pancake was so good! I enjoyed it a lot.

Parking was easy to find on the streets. According to many of the yelp reviews I've read, during the lunch hours are the best times to go but I went during the night lol. The prices for dinner was a bit higher I think when I compared the prices to the lunch menu I saw. My friend and I waited maybe 5 minutes or so before we got seated. We sat the table with grill and ordered the marinated gal bi and the pork belly! Both was delicious. Everything was marinated and they also give you tons of side dishes also! It's nice that the waitresses also grill the meat for you or you can grill them yourself. (For me, I'm lazy so I was glad they were there to grill the meat for me). All the food you order comes with the side dishes so you don't gotta worry about having to order those. We also ordered the Japchae (clear noodles) with veggies and beef. The japchae was alright, nothing special. I've ate japchae before at many Korean places but this place is A-ok when it comes to this dish. Our food came pretty quick. Service is quick and the servers are nice. The price is a bit too high in my opinion. You can eat AYCE korean bbq somewhere else and pay less than individual meats that they Han II Kwan has.  \n\nNext time, I'll try coming during the lunch hours. Oh, I forgot to mention, this place is known to have tour buses bring the tourists here so you may run into a big crowd of people.

After looking at the kbbq places around San Francisco, I saw this place had the most reviews and a good amount of stars compared to the other kbbq places. I've been coming here every Monday for three weeks straight. The first two times I came here, the wait was around 15-20 minutes. The outer booths are for kbbq and most of the middle seating is for ordering cooked dishes. Their grill is the best compared to the other kbbq places I tried. Their side dishes weren't full of my favorites but they were fresh and the meat was perfect. Their kbbq meat is pretty pricey, and you have to order a minimum of two of their kbbq meats to self-cook. I ordered their marinated beef short ribs ($29.95) the first time I came but didn't like it. My favorite is their brisket and pork belly. I'm also in love with the sauce you dip the meat in; I believe it's sesame oil mixed with salt and pepper. It comes with rice and a complimentary spicy tofu soup (1) and tea. The kbbq meat also includes complimentary lettuce wraps and sauce. \nHowever, the third time my friend and I came here, we waited for 55 minutes to get a seat. It was my idea to keep coming back since I really enjoyed their food the first two times, so I didn't mind waiting. The waitress in charge of seating people didn't acknowledge us and let us know the wait time. I saw her go around to several other people waiting and talk to them about their possible wait time. When we were finally seated, some of their sides didn't look fresh but I was surprised they brought out my favorite fish cake sides; it didn't taste as good as I hoped. So I looked forward to eating their brisket and pork belly. But when it arrived, I noticed the amount and size of the meat decreased compared to what we got last time. \nThe freshness of their side dishes can be a hit or miss. I also felt like it wasn't worth the money the third time we came here. Coming here every Monday for three weeks straight, it's too much sesame oil, salt, pepper and meat.

I enjoyed it immensely, and here are some key points that come into eating here.\n\nLocation: 5/5\nThe restaurant is located on 19th and Balboa, in a small corner shop of the street. The place looks quaint and small, but the inside has a large area with two huge cooking tables and other any tables surrounding it, plus a back area with more tables. When you go in, you sign into a paper to get seated and it goes quick. Me and my family came in quickly during the lunch rush hour and got seated within 5 minutes. Parking for cars may get a bit hard as the streets are very packed, so make sure to keep searching!\n\nFood/Pricing: 5/5\nOkay, okay. This food is incredible. They give you free banchan, rice, AND choice of tofu soup or steamed egg. I have never been to a place that gives out free tofu soup, but they gave our table two free soups and it was really good. I usually don't enjoy soup, but this one wasn't overly spicy, still flavorful, and the tofu was really soft. The star of the banchan was the kimchi. My god, the radishes were fresh and cold, really snapped in my mouth and were refreshing, while the cabbage had the sour taste that made your mouth reminisce of past kimchi experiences, but better in that it was stronger in taste and the cabbage was fresh. We also ordered dwaegi-bulgolgi (spicy pork), seafood pancake, and japchae (glass noodles). The spicy pork was really good, also not as spicy but tasty meat. The seafood pancake we got was huge, with 8 pieces filled with vegetables and squid that made me extremely satisfied. The japchae was the most normal out do the bunch, not too bad but also not that good. Everything else made up for it, however. They also give you a little bit of rice water at the end, to clear your mouth which was awesome. I had that done in a restaurant only once in the past. The pricing was typical of a Korean a-la-carte place, mid-range around $25 for meat and $15 for other food, but nothing that broke the bank too much.\n\nService: 4/5\nThe service here was quick paced and nice. The ladies that served us were rapid and to the point, but also courteous as they allowed us to order while we discussed what we should still order. It did, however, take us three times to get our drinks after receiving our food, and when we wanted to get to-go boxes, one lady looked past us TWICE and didn't come to our tables. Our main server, however, was nice and she made it up to us. \n\nIn conclusion, if you're ever in the Richmond District or the Bay Area and want some good Korean food, this place is the best.

You have the option of grilling the meat yourself or having them cook it for you in the kitchen.\n\nThe side dish game is spot on - standouts are the kimchi, bean sprouts and seaweed salad. For the meats, we ordered the marinated beef short ribs, marinated beef rib eye, and marinated chicken. We had them cook it in the kitchen - they cooked it perfectly and the wait time was short. The meat was delicious, fresh and flavorful, especially the marinated chicken - this was the first Korean BBQ place I've been to where the chicken was a standout (in my experience, the chicken at other places usually comes out dry and lacking in flavor). In addition, the japchae here was one of the best I've had - perfect proportion of noodle, vegetables and beef without too much grease. They also give you free soup!\n\nWe happened to be in the Golden Gate Bridge / Presidio area the next day and decided to come back here for dinner since it was so good.

Great banchan and the ladies here are so nice...though be prepared to wait if you don't have a reservation!\n\nWhat to order:\n- Kalbi - marinated beef short-rib. Even though beef is BAD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, I still can't help drooling over kbbq kalbi. The meat is cooked and cut to the right proportions..so you know exactly why you're dishing out $30 for it. Nice and fatty - I'd take this over bulgogi any day!\n\n- Kimchi Jigae - Kimchi Stew! This is comfort food for me! I can eat this all the time and for any occasion! Definitely do it right here :)\n\n- Steamed Egg - It's like a savory egg souffl\u00e9.. really good texture and serve in a giant bowl for sharing!\n\n- Japchae - Glass-noodle dish with veggies. I love it here cuz it's not too sweet and they add a lot of it..not just a bunch of noodles. Yum!\n\n- Bibimbop - The stone pot bibimbop is all about the same here as it is elsewhere. Not too outstanding here, but sometimes you just crave it.\n\nAnytime we're in the area, this is where we inevitably end up eating! Highly recommend!", "author": "Jennifer S."}

Parking can be a pain in the ass here though so either Uber/Lyft or prepare to spend at least 30 mins circling around for parking. \n\nI'm really amazed at how they handle big crowds here. When we were there this past weekend, they had two big tour buses (it's a regular thing here) coming for dinner and they were able to serve them in and out within 1.5 hour. \n\nMy favorite dish here is the Galbi Jjim. The portion is huge, enough for 2-3 people to share and the meat is marinated so well and tender.

The kalbi just melts in your mouth and the stewed flavors is a nice medley of savory and sweet. The Kalbi Jjim comes with a generous heaping of potatoes and carrots and even the stew alone is delish served with rice. If I'm only allowed a single dish, this would be my pick.\n\nNAENG MYEON\nThis is a cold, buckwheat noodle in a icy broth served with cucumber shavings, half a hard boiled egg, and slices of pork. This is the standard meal for sweaty hot days but since San Francisco doesn't really have those, I guess a nice sunny day can calls for naeng myeon too. It's not too special but for the sake of nostalgia, I got this. I was dining with my family and they weren't a big fan but I'd still suggest people to try it.\n\nSEAFOOD PANCAKE\nTheir seafood pancake is loaded with lots of various seafood. I recall generous portions of shrimp, leek, and squid. You really can't go wrong with this.\n\nTTEOKBOKKI\nThe tteok are the long cylinder rice cakes and they are the perfect amount of chewy drenched in a spicy chili sauce.

There were maybe 5 sides and at a normal restaurant there's at least double that.\n\nThey have these cool big \"pitchers\" of Hite beer that are $15 and we all shared that.  Ended up getting two for 4 people.\n\nWhen ordering meat there's a limit of 3 per order to avoid wasting food which was fair.  The best thing we got was the miso pork belly.

Usually a lot of restaurants don't serve as much variety in Korean cuisine. The menu you here, although very pricey, lists an extensive number of choices. Came here with a few friends on a Friday night around 7pm, and the wait wasn't too long. Something to be aware of, the dinner was particularly special for us because we all studied abroad in Korea together and decided to meet up that night. The fact that we've experienced Korean cuisine from the motherland might be factored into my critique.\n\nSERVICE: Great service! They came by very often to check in to see if we're ready to order and also to grill the meat for us. They even provided complimentary 1 bowl of tofu soup with our meal and sweet rice drinks afterwards.\n\nFOOD:\nBanchan: (5/5) 9 plates of kimchi, bean sprouts, radish, acorn jelly, dried anchovies, tofu skins, and a few others. All of it tasted good.\n\nChamisul Soju: Normally I don't feel the need to comment on soju, since it's all the same anyways. But no, they also gave us this vial of \"Red Knights\" to add a few drops to our soju shots, which is something none of us have ever heard of before. I tried looking it up, and it apparently it's some sort of hangover cocktail vinegar base. I guess it made the soju a bit smoother?\n\nGalbi, Bulgogi, Spicy Pork, and Pork Belly: (5/5) Okay, so this restaurant was slightly different due to the service provided. The servers would actually come by every now and then to ensure our meat was cooked properly, which I really appreciated. We didn't have to do much grilling ourselves as we reminisced about the good ole days back in Seoul. As we went through each plate of meat, I thought everything tasted great. I have nothing bad to say about any of our selections except for the prices. They would also provide a small basket of lettuce for wraps as well.\n\nSeafood Pancake: (5/5) What I loved about this dish is that they fill the thick pancake with whole pieces of scallop inside along with pieces of other seafood.\n\nA very nice place for Korean food.", "author": "Kevin S."}

There was no wait, but only because it was 3 pm. Surprisingly, the restaurant had a good amount of people inside though!\n\nWe ordered the japchae ($15) and the bulgogi ($24) to share. The prices may seem a bit steep, but once you factor in the endless supply of delicious banchan (side dishes), the huge portions, and the free tofu soup or steamed egg (yes, FREE!!), the prices will look fair. The banchan came out first and they were all amazing--my favorites were the fish cake, the pickled daikon, the broccoli, the bean sprouts, the pickled cucumber, and the little dried fish. Also rather noteworthy is the tea, which is the traditional roasted barley tea! \n\nThe entrees came out pretty fast afterwards. The japchae portion was huuuge, had a great texture and sauce, and had the perfect ratio of noodles, veggies, and meat! Not that we needed any more meat... Because the bulgogi portion was even bigger! Meat was cooked well and the marinade was very yummy! Between the two of us, we probably only finished around 2/3 of each entree. We both took home takeout boxes full of japchae, bulgogi, and side dishes.\n\nAt the end, they will give you a super sweet rice drink. It sort of just tastes like rice water with little bits of rice at the bottom haha. Interesting!\n\nFor the total we both paid around $25 each. Not bad for a full tummy and a bunch of leftovers!

Many places in the city cut corners by cutting down on the selection/quantity/quality of ban-chan (the free little side dishes you get at most Korean restaurants), or not spending the time to cook their broth for dishes like sunndubu or yukgaejang. You won't find any of that BS here. IMO, Han Il Kwan serves the most authentic Korean food in SF at a very reasonable price range.\n\nThey also have Korean BBQ, which is awesome. The service is attentive, and often times they would throw in a dish or two on the house, which is nice.\n\nI've been to Han Il Kwan multiple times and for several years.

WITH THAT SAID! Here is my review.\n\nI made reservations via the San Francisco Urban Adventure Club 2 weeks ago for 8 people and I'm glad I did. I got there 30 mins early (6:30pm) an there were a ton of tables open, as soon as it hit 6:45pm there were people waiting for a table and writing their names down looking to get seated.\n\nStaff was so friendly without over doing it. Whenever my table (of 6, not 8) and I would ask for something there was no attitude, they just got whatever we needed. We didn't feel like we were bothering them BUT we also didn't bug them lol.\n\nWe ordered Dinner - A for 6 people.This dinner option was huge! It fed all 6 of us and we are all foodies who at the moment happen to be very hangry. This dinner option is great for tables who have both a meat eater and vegetarians. There was a ton of meats, a ton of seafood, a ton of vegetables. The quality of the food was really good and the service again was impeccable.The only item on the menu that didn't wow the group was the spicy tofu stew. I didn't have any but everyone else said it was just \"ok\" compared to everything else we had. But everything else was fantastic! They also didn't get cheap with the food, there was a lot.\n\nThe ambience was great too. Everything about this please felt authentic. They even had alcohol options that I haven't seen in most places.\n\nI look forward to eating here again. If you can bring six people and have dinner a then you will save a lot of money. Also, this menu option comes with bibimbap and small bowls of rice. If you don't want so much rice just tell them you dont want a small bowl.", "author": "Rani C."}

My grandparents live a couple blocks away so I have always seen Korean tour buses double parked in front of the restaurant and thought it was a tourist trap. Boy was I wrong! \n\nAll table orders either come with the tofu soup with beef or the steamed egg. We got the tofu soup and it seemed like they added a little bit too much chili flakes in it but wasn't too spicy overall. I ordered the bimbambap in the stone pot and it was delicious. My only wish was that my stone pot was a little bit hotter as my friend got the seafood stone pot and hers was way hotter than mine.

Compared to the incredible Korean BBQ in L.A., I've got to give this place a one star rating. On top of there being no parking nearby, the quality of the meat is just not good. I was slightly hopeful when the price of the meats were a little bit higher ($25-$30) but nope, they were just overpriced. \n\nWe opted for a table for where we wouldn't cook it ourselves. At legit Korean BBQs, the servers come to the table and cook it for you anyway, so to save ourselves time on the wait list, we decided to get seated at whatever table opened up first. \n\nThe Non-marinated Beef Short Ribs came out way overcooked as did the Marinated Beef Rib Eye. Normally at Korean BBQ, I'll make sure that all the meat is eaten so it doesn't go to waste. Here, I just couldn't bring myself to finish all this dry and burnt meat. What a shame. \n\nThe banchan was a letdown as well. You have to choose between the tofu soup and the steamed egg. You can't have both unless you pay more. You also can't get seconds on these items either. (I'll give props to the tofu soup. If they allowed free seconds on it, I'd maybe consider raising this review to two stars.)\n\nI've had better Korean BBQ at food courts at a fraction of the price.

I was having second thoughts of coming here for food, because I called and they said the wait was 45 minutes. Time passed by quickly as we went to do some shopping nearby.\n\nAs many would tell you, Korean food in San Francisco is nowhere near as good as Los Angeles. I would venture to say Orange County Koren food is even better than the bay area. And Atlanta for that matter. Having said that, Han II Kwan is very good. It's popular because, I think, this is one of the only ethnic restaurants around the neighborhood, plus the Korean tour buses stop there. Their banchans are good and plenty. They have decent selection. One time they gave us tofu pot, pancakes AND steamed egg. This time we only got the usual plus the steamed egg. I grew up on that steamed egg dish. It's my go to comfort food. Did I mention that I'm 9% Korean? Ah, it's in my blood to appreciate the banchans. I asked for seconds. They bring them out immediately. \n\nI think the soup is very good. I tend to get the fish roe soup here. The beef short ribs seems to be a huge portion for one person. A lot more than what you'd get in other Korean places. They have cold Korean beer. It's a lager and very light, it reminds of me of the beer I consumed as a young girl in northeastern China. \n\nThe best part about this restaurant is its location. A bit quieter than the Inner Richmond area's Korean restaurants on Geary. I recall being much younger and going to Brother's BBQ on Geary every Thursday with some young male consultant types, the gathering was more about drinking and dating fest than eating Korean food.

You think I'd explode from a 1-hour wait for dinner, but for Han Il Kwan there is no arguing that every bite was worth every minute.\n\nThe deliciousness begins with the colorful variety of banchan, consisting mostly of pickled veggies so you don't feel quite so guilty with all the carnivorous entrees to come. And they do not skimp--no odd non-Korean side dishes (I've seen mayo fruit salad and canned corn at other places). They even serve the small dried fish which is a rare banchan nowadays (probably due to its considerably higher cost in comparison to alternatives like canned corn).\n\nI usually don't care much for beef short ribs, but the kalbi jjim is heavenly. While most kalbi seems dry and a bit tough in texture (not to mention the extra time and efforts needed to dissect out the bones), the kalbi jjim is more like beef stew, with surprisingly moist and tender chunks of beef that melt in your mouth like slow-cooked pork--props to pro cooking technique rather than relying on extra fattiness for that melty goodness that is on par with pork belly. Just a hint of spice is added, placing the emphasis on the rich beef flavors. The vegetable condiments are good as well, but unfortunately there is no space in my stomach for potatoes when it comes to dinner at Han Il Kwan.\n\nThe memorable kalbi jjim was definitely the highlight, especially because it's a dish you can't get at most Korean places. We also got the beef bulgogi and spicy pork for kBBQ, bean paste soup, and japchae, all of which were good as well. I especially liked the japchae, which wasn't too greasy and had a lot of veggies and beef. The only potential problem is that the spicy pork was marinated in orange-red sauce, so it was hard to be sure that it was cooked.\n\nThe meal finished off with a sweet rice drink. Although it's listed as a recommended item on Yelp, I found it interesting but thought it was too sweet. (Maybe I'm too used to 30% sugar from all my boba orders)\n\nThe damage was $20/person total--not bad for all the amazing Korean specialties and endless kBBQ. Worth it despite the 1-hour wait and my extra work volunteering as tribute to do the kBBQ cooking.\n\nSide note: They have better ventilation than YakiniQ, so you actually don't come home smelling like you sat in a sauna of kBBQ smoke.", "author": "Edna C."}

I already anticipated a wait which I didn't mind at all. Added ourselves on the wait list for two people and waited. The lady approached us a couple of times to check if we still wanted the BBQ option and we said yes. 30 minutes pass by, then 45 minutes pass by and we are watching all these groups getting seated. She finally came up to us again and realized that she had totally skipped us on the list. We were close to the top of the first page and she had crossed out all the names before and after and had seated a bunch of people on the second page already. Those who were seated when we got there were already leaving. She apologized quietly with her face turned away and told us that we will get the next BBQ table. Great, we waited this long, might as well stick through it (even though we were getting hella hungry and irritated already). Soon after, we saw a table leave and figured YES, FINALLY. However, the lady went ahead and seated this other couple who were standing in front of us. At this point I was so pissed.

Han Il Kwan seemed like one of the more promising options, however. On Labor Day, we stopped by at 1:15pm for lunch and had to wait about 20 minutes before we were seated.\n\nThe decor is cute with some booths and Korean style roofs inside. When we were finally seated, we both ordered the dolsot bibimbap lunch special. Dolsot bibimbap is one of my favorite Korean dishes and this version was average at best. I did like that the rice got a great crisp. I didn't like that the egg was cracked unevenly so half of it was scrambled and half of it was uncooked sunny-side up. I also do not appreciate cheap chewy bulgogi in my bibimbap; I'd prefer to pay more for galbi.\n\nThe banchan were alright but since japchae is sold as an entree, it did not come as part of the banchan spread.

It is true tho - loooooong waits, probably due to huge Korean tour buses that unload into the restaurant at an alarming frequency. There's a new group every hour!! They really hustle those groups. But they tend to block off all the back room tables for them, so at least you don't have to eat in the middle of them. It just means a lot fewer tables for the rest of us :( and there a lot of us non-tour-group people. My group of 8 got pretty lucky. We arrived around 5:30pm on a Sunday night and I put our name down (maybe 8th in line). I heard a group of 4 complaining that they had arrived at 4:30 and were still waiting!! That. Sucks. Anyhow, we actually managed to be seated around 6, not too long after that group of 4. We must have come at the end of the first wave of the dinner crowd so they all finished eating around the same time and a bunch of tables opened up at once. Whew! I'm glad we didn't have to wait too long because we probably would have gone elsewhere and missed out on the AMAZING FOOD!!\n\nAlso, bring a Korean friend with you. The servers were definitely ignoring me blatantly when I was trying to get an estimate on the wait time -.- I've also just noticed that they tend to be a lot nicer and attentive on waiting your table when there are Koreans haha \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\n\nOnto the food! We got the set dinner for 8ppl ($180) and it was plenty of food with leftovers! It came with a ton of entrees and a large bibimbap bowl and tofu soup. The bibimbap was reaaaaally good, I definitely want to come back and just order one of them as my meal. The japchae was also delicious as well as the pork bulgogi and kalbi that we ordered (you get to choose two meats from a selection). The meat came with lettuce wraps and fermented bean paste which was yummy. Everyone gets a bowl of rice as well - overall a very well-rounded meal with tons of variety! I would def recommend the set menu if you have a group of 6 or larger. \n\nOther pluses were the delicious hot barley tea and also the sweet for rice drink they bring at the end of your meal!\n\nOh almost forgot... pro-tip: they take reservations but NOT same-day res (we tried that first) so make a reservation at least a day in advance to hopefully skip out on the long lines!!", "author": "Grace D."}

Parking is relatively easy to find, and the wait time is not too long.

I wish  there were more seats to sit on when waiting, but that's also fine. The view through the windows are nice, but there could be ventilation to help clear up the heavy smell of fat and oil.

I asked if portions were enough to share.. she said.. .NO ONE PER PERSON.  OK so we proceeded to order accordingly. When food arrived it was like a buffet for 10 people. We were 4. I also ordered after discussing with waitress what I thought was korean beer that turned out to be a large green bottle with a high alcohol sake like concoction. Not suitable as a meal drink.  FOOD REVIEW; Not impressed.  Meats:  spicy pork was ok but mushy,  and flavors not balanced.. marinated beef was bland.  These meats were chopped and seemed to be boiled .as they were on the wet side and no grill marks.. so much for korean bbq. Portions were large but at almost $30 each,  ..we could have ordered 1 meat.  The bimbap bowls similar story.. wer ordered two.. again.. way too much food. The seafood bimbap was yukio, overly fishy flavor,  octopus was tough as a rock.. the other one was regular bimbap with white rice, egg,  protein etc.. waitress had recommended as one of favorites.  It was just OK, Low on flavor.  There's a Cuban restaurant in Miami, FINKA, that that does a much better bimbap. Anyhow.. overall disappointed.. the general theme here was that waitress cannot communicate and is guiding food amount choices incorrectly.

Kal-bi: Marinated beef short ribs ($22.95)\n15. Soft tofu soup with chopped vegetables in beef broth ($9.95)\n44. Chap-chae: Stir-fried vermicelli with vegetables and beef ($13.95)\n68. Whole king fish ($14.95)\n\nYou can bbq here too, but I typically have the restaurant prepare the meats. I love kalbi, so I always order that. Han il kwan's version is flavorful and has a great sear. I love my soondubu spicy and they make it just right here. The tofu is silky and the broth delicious! The japchae has a nice chew and a good amount of veggies and beef. And the fish is nicely grilled.\n\nThe roommate and I have been exploring other places lately for Korean bbq cuz I've been on a new restaurant kick. But we always come back to Han il kwan. The only drawback to the place is parking can be a little difficult at times. Good thing the roommate has a motorcycle for occasions like these. Easy parking with that. Leftovers however, can be challenging. But we've managed to make it work. That's how much we love Han il kwan!", "author": "Elena N."}

It's more than most Korean places in the City and its pretty darn good!  They also offer tofu soup and mini egg pancakes as part of the sides...if i can do the emoji face with the heart as eyes...it is exactly how i feel about this place and the ban chan....SIGHHHHH \n\nThe spicy bulgogi was very sweet, more sweet than I would like, but it wasn't bad.  We wanted to do it ourselves, but maybe they were closing soon so it came cooked (no biggies, we didnt wanna smell like BBQ)  Portion size is alright, good enough for 2\n\nDaboki...very saucy!! i love it!! i wish they add just some garnish to it - it was just sauce and rice cake.  Eventually the gluten got into the sauce...making it thick.  This too was a bit too sweet\n\nJapchae - it was loaded!  had a lot of veggies - i feel like theres more veggies than there was noodles and hardly any meat =(...it wasnt bad but maybe the taste of bell peppers kinda ruined it for me.\n\nAlso...free dessert drink...*drools*\n\nFor 2 people....we TOTALLY over ordered...but I will for sure come again", "author": "Laurie W."}

We ordered a soup, a pancake and bibimbab for four people. The restaurant gave us an extra tofu soup on top of our order. We are very satisfied with the taste and portion. The bill comes out to be only 45$. Fantastic deal for a Korean restaurant that you can not get elsewhere for four people meal. Of course, the BBQ dishes are a bit more expensive if you have a table of meat lovers, but you do get a big portion as well.

I hadn't made a reservation and I called at 11AM on the Tuesday I planned to visit to make a reservation for 5 at 7PM. Expecting there to be no reservation slots left, they said it was totally fine. My group arrived slightly early around 6:50 PM. We were seated immediately. I also saw two tables that were empty. For 7PM, I was expecting a large crowd and was pleasantly surprised not to find any.\n\nWe got a booth with a grill in the middle. We ordered spicy bulgogi and spicy pork to share. Each table comes with either gyeran or soondooboo. We opted for the soondooboo. The kimchi was super fresh and tasted slightly spicier than your average kimchi. The banchan was very plentiful and included kongnamul, gamja jorim, myulchi, and fishcake jorim. The bulgogi and spicy pork tasted better than other places I've been to (hint: yakiniq) because the meat was not super fatty. We also ordered pajeon and it was some of the thickest pajeon I've seen. Some places make it very thin and flat but this one was stuffed with lots of veggies. I also loved the oksu cha. Some restaurants use tea bags. This restaurant made it from scratch with the actual kernels. The tea was full of flavor and not diluted or weak like some tea that is served at other restaurants. \n\nAt the end of the meal, the waitress gave everyone complimentary sikhye. That is really nice service. I've never been to a Korean restaurant with free sikhye at the end. \n\nAll in all it was a very pleasant experience.

IT WAS SO MUCH FOOD. Not including side dishes (which they gave a plentiful amount - see pictures!) we had: 1) two plates of pork, 2) two plates of spicy pork, 3) bimbimbap, 4) grilled fish, 5) kimchi/tofu/beef soup/stew, 5) gamja guksu, 6) spicy octopus/seafood, 7) mini seafood pancakes, 8) deep fried seafood and veggies. Hope I didn't leave anything out. But yeah. It was so much food....definitely enough for 10 of us! \n\nSo I am from LA and have been spoiled with the all-you-can-eat KBBQ. I have a pretty high standard for Korean BBQ, and I would say this one can be on the same playing field as the ones in SoCal. The meat was well marinated, especially the spicy pork. The gamja was also very tasty. The service was very nice and the waitress/waiters helped us (occasionally) to cook the meat. Since it was Halloween, they also gave us chocolates (how sweet!!!).\n\nBut yeah. Definitely come with an empty stomach and clothes that you don't mind getting greasy smells in!

So it came down to either My Tofu House or Han Il Kwan, which were both open by 11am. The deal breaker between choosing the two was that My Tofu House didn't serve soju haha so Han Il Kwan it is. We came for lunch and there were many open tables so we sat right away with no wait.\n\nThis was my second visit here, but I still have yet to use the bbq grill where you cook your own meat. Last time I got a bbq beef bibimbab in the hot stone pot because I like my rice crispy. The egg the serve is always a perfect sunny side up to crack and mix all into the bowl, but it was a little skimp on the meat.\n\nThis time around my bf and I decided to get spicy pork and bulgolgi, which they cook for you if you opt out of grilling it yourself. The meats are the same price no matter which option you choose, but the bbq grill requires a minimum of 2 meats. It is on the pricier side for about ~$22 a plate, but from what I remember that's at least cheaper than Brother's on Geary.\n\nThe meat plates come with banchan, rice and their house egg soup but I decided to order tofu soup also. Before we even placed our order, the waiter dropped off their potato pancakes on the house which came with 2 mini ones. The spicy pork plate came out quickly after and once we were a few shots of soju in (no fruity soju cocktails here), we were grubbing and realized that we already had so much food at our table.\n\nThe spicy pork was piled with so much meat that we started to think if they brought out the bulgolgi, it'd be too much food. I checked in with one of the waiters and she looked confused as if they never even put in an order for the bulgolgi. Good thing we felt that our order on the table was enough so I just told her to cancel it. It was most likely a miscommunication because we had multiple servers taking our order, checking on us and bringing out the food so they must have had a misunderstanding.\n\nBesides the little mishap, everything was very enjoyable and tasty. The pork was well marinated and thoroughly cooked. The tofu soup could have been a little spicier, but the tofu, beef and mushrooms in the soup were all soft and comforting to eat. It is worth making the drive into the Richmond when craving kbbq! But I will try to limit my visits for only lunch hours as I hear it gets really packed for dinner.", "author": "Georgina G."}

Service wasn't the best on our most recent visit due to how busy it was, but it's understandable. We had to be pretty persistent in calling staff over to get more banchan or tea.

I must admit though,I'm really picky because I have Korean food quite often.\n\nThe place is not that big but it's pretty and clean. They'll ask you right away if you want to do Korean bbq or regular food. I opted for the Korean bbq. It was a Monday night but it was full. Parking in the area is a pain though and there were definitely police officers writing tickets.\n\nI tried the kalbi, bulgogi, seafood pancake, and spicy rice cake. The kalbi was cut down differently than the kalbi I normally have. Normally it's sliced thinly across the bones, so you end up with a strip of meat with a couple pieces of bone. Imagine baby back ribs but cut perpendicular against the bone. Theirs is more like an English rib with the layers of meat fileted and a giant bone for the end piece. \n\nThe reason why I'm bothering to mention this is because I think the cut impacts the marinating and flavoring. Thinner cuts usually need less time to marinate for maximum flavor. Their meats altogether was just bland. \n\nThe rice cake was ok. It was just rice cake - no fish or egg or even scallion added. Yet another bland dish. The sea food pancake was probably the best dish and had a lot of filling. They did give you a lot of side dishes and some tofu soup though.\n\nAll in all, I would come back if I don't feel like making my own Korean food but in such a big city, I feel like there must be more options.

(She's not working there anymore.) The services would be excellent if she was. Lol\nAnyways, owners have changed but the food still remains pretty close to home cooked, authentic korean cuisines. My favs are the Ahl chigae, (fish egg stew.) Yook geh jang, (spicy, shredded beef soup with japchae noodles.) I'll ask for extra spicy for that soup but its got pretty good heat as is. Everything that is spicy....u can get it milder or stronger.  The Ojing ah bokkem.(spicy squid with vegetables stir fry.) The bbq is good but I really believe the soups, stews and seafoods are the things that make me crave for the things that taste like home. \nI've learned that its easier and less, ( price wise,) to do lunch or lunch takeout. I've tried many other korean places in SF and this is by far the best. Especially if you like a lot of variety with banchans. \nIf you're looking to take a party with more than 5 people. The set menu for dinner is the best bang for your buck.  That's probably the only times where I'll dine in-house. Other than that, 20 mins. for takeout. No hunting for parking.

Interesting.\n\nWe ordered way too much food for 3 people: short ribs, spicy pork, beef vermicelli noodles, and seafood tofu soup. In addition, they provided tons of appetizers along with a fluffy egg thing in a pot. 3 people came out to $93! Each plate of meat (order at least 2 and you can bbq it on the table) was about $30. Very pricey but the quality of the meat was good. The spicy pork was flavorful and delicious. A plate comes with enough pork to feed a few people. The kim chi and spicy salted anchovies were my favorite appetizers; it was spiced and it tasted just right. \n\nOverall, although our meal was expensive, we would've been fine if we ordered one less dish. I would recommend this place if you're in the area, but if you're located quite a far drive from this place, there are other great Korean spots that provides the same quality foods at different parts of the Bay.", "author": "Rita K."}

Went here 2 years ago, but never got the chance to try again until now!\n\nBeing Asian, and being a college kid, PRICE, PRICE, PRICE matters! My friends and I headed to the restaurant at 3:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon and we did the craziest FAST AND FURIOUS drive to pick up 2 other people and try to make it for their lunch special ending at 4pm. ***ALL DRIVING WAS LEGAL, (somewhat safe-ish, but still legal) DONT REPORT US*** We were so desperate, every minute made us sweat. We weren't about to pay full price for the dishes! haha. We literally got there at 3:57 and PRAYED TO BUDDAH that we could still do the lunch special.

We had the Tofu soup which was good but not great, two types of beef including the Galbi which was excellent, and a hot stone pot with beef and egg which wasn't bad.  I would give the food overall 4 stars and think it is one of the better places in bay area to grab Korean food (not saying much since the bay area isn't nearly as good with Korean food as Southern California).  \n\nNow we get to the bad part.  The waitress we had was downright mean.  We asked for recommendations and she acted like she was giving up her left lung to help us.   Not only was she mean, she gave off a vibe of just not wanting to be bothered by anything.   The fact that this restaurant gets 4 stars despite the horrible way it treats its customers shows how good the food can be.  \n\nI won't say I wouldn't come back for lunch for the food if I'm in the area and bring my headphones to block out the bad service but Han II Kwan isn't a place I would just drive to on its own for a pleasurable dining experience", "author": "Steven S."}

Honestly, I would have given this place 4 stars but when I factored in the service and the cleanliness, I felt I had to take off a star. I've been to this restaurant maybe twice before and I was always impressed with the food. But it's not just the food that I'm writing this review for. It's the overall quality of the restaurant.\n\nWhen we walked into the restaurant, there was a sign near the door that says for us to wait to be seated. We waited for about a minute before someone noticed us and seated us with menus. I love the menu. There were tons of colored photos so that we can see what we are ordering. My sister, my cousin, and I decided to order three items: the beef short ribs ($11.95), spicy pork ($8.50), and kimchi pancakes ($14.95).   \n\nWe waited, and waited, and waited for awhile before the server returned to take our orders. Maybe we were a little cranky because we were hungry (again). But it felt like it took forever before they noticed that we were ready to order. When the server brought us our utensils, I noticed that my spoon had rice dried onto the back of it. There was also a wasp that flew around our table, which scared us half to death since we didn't want to be stung. And there was a fruit fly hovering over our food once our food arrived. \n\nThe food itself was wonderful. I have never seen so many side dishes offered before. They even offered a complimentary tofu soup! Side dishes included seasoned bean sprouts, kimchi, fish cake, spicy yellow radishes (the ones found in sushi rolls), spicy white radish, some sort of white jello thing in spicy soy sauce, and spicy cucumbers. All were delicious and very filling. I think those dishes in itself could have been a meal.\n\nI didn't try the beef short ribs since I don't eat beef. But the spicy pork was delicious. It was the right level of spiciness and the meat was tender and flavorful. The kimchi pancakes were pretty good too. I loved the pancake batter because it was crispy on the edges. I'm on the edge about the kimchi inside the pancakes. Only because every once in awhile I feel like it was too sour. But over all, I thought they were pretty good.\n\nI also loved that as dessert, they gave us a complimentary rice drink with our bill. It was sweet and there were some soft rice at the bottom.\n\nIn the end, I was a little annoyed that they took awhile to give us our bill too. The servers came in and out a lot and by then, there weren't that many tables left so I couldn't understand why they didn't see us waving at them. In general, I felt that the service was slow even though there weren't too many customers.\n\nI really liked this place from my previous visits so I'm just going to assume that it was an off day for them. But I hope that in the future, the service isn't going to be as slow as it was today.", "author": "Andrea G."}

It's one of those things - like extra warm weather or more places to buy yoga pants and froyo - that people who love Los Angeles always tout as a benefit over living in San Francisco.\n\nHan II Kwan is about the best I think you can do in the city. Generous with the little dishes they serve at the beginning, and a good selection of well apportioned entrees.\n\nMy tips for you:\n\n-Don't order the \"recommended\" family style menu. You can do better (economically) and also selection-wise ordering for yourself\n\n-Cook your own food tables are extremely limited. If you want that you could be waiting a lot of extra time\n\n-This place is a whole lot bigger than it looks from the outside.

I'm so stoked to have found Han Il Kwan, no longer do I need to fly down to SoCal, NoVa, or Sunnyvale to eat an authentic Korean food. \n\nWe've tried Galbi, Seafood Casserole, Mul Naengmyun, and everything tastes on the same par as the really good places in SoCal, NoVa and Flushing. Well, except for the Naengmyun, maybe this was an off day for Naengmyun.\n\nThe panchans were great but the steamed egg souffle (on the house) was a bit bland but I'm a fan of the generous portion of the ShikHae after our meal. The price is reasonable, service is adequate but it's always a full house at dinner time here so at least we were served and refilled with everything requested. Yey!", "author": "Taffany H."}

I guess that should be expected since it's a Saturday? \n\nAnyway, after over an hour wait, we finally got our round table. (We were a party of 5). We almost left the place if not because of the time we spent looking for parking. We spent a good amount of time looking and didn't want it to go to waste.  \n\nThey have a menu for a large group, which was perfect for us. We ordered Dinner A for a party of six for $140. We got to choose two kinds of meat, and it comes with tofu soup, squid with veggies, bibimbap, broiled fish, stir fried vermicelli, pan fried shrimps and veggies, steamed eggs. Yup definitely had a lot of left overs.\n\nHonestly, I think the food was okay but kinda pricey. I really like the rice juice they gave out at the end though. It was sweet and refreshing. I recommend to try it. I would prob go back here if I'm around the area only... because really, parking is hard to find.\n\nThe customer service was not that great so just be prepared. We were only given three servings of rice and when I asked for the other two, the lady came back with one rice. So I asked her later again and she seemed irritated. She answered \"I gave you one already!\" \n\nWell duh? I know that, but I asked for two! I needed one more that's why I asked her. It didn't occur to her I guess? Maybe didn't hear my \"two\". She didn't seem too happy and since they were busy I felt like I was bothering her. I understand that they were busy and I didn't really care about that missing rice.  I just didn't like they way she had to raise her voice at me. I was only asking for a rice and she yelled at me in front of my friends.=/ Anyway, she didn't come back with the other one.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-22", "description": "So far, my favorite Korean barbecue in SF, and the only one that matches my memories of Koreatown in New York -- though unlike those, this one is more of a daytime, orderly, family-friendly sit down meal than the late night clubbing experience that goes on in New York.\n\nIt's all about the food. We had soft tofu soup, seafood dolsat bibimbap, and saut\u00e9ed squid. The tofu soup was rich, flavorful, and just right. The bibimbap was perfect too, perfectly crisped rice on the outside, flavorful inside, good balance, a fresh and generous assortment of seafood (both somewhat unusual among SF Korean restaurants) though understandably using lots of smaller shrimp and scallops instead of centerpieces. My favorite was the squid, large slices of big squids, vegetables, perfectly toothy yet tender. All of these dishes had a nice balance of flavor that was both fresh and clear, but also multilayered and full of umami, thanks I think to a chili sauce (that also came in a squirt bottle on the table) that had a miso-like taste in addition to its heat and chili flavor. They also brought out a steamed egg custard on the house (delicious, delicate), and the customary sweet rice dessert in the little plastic cups (nice). The banchan was a standout, unusually bright tasting and fresh despite many items being fermented. The real test, the kimche, was some of the best in town, but even the minimally processed cucumber slices were just right.\n\nPrices were about average. If you barbecue at the table be ready to pay $23+ per person, plus drinks, tax, tip, and any side orders so it adds up. If you order the regular items on the menu, it's a deal -- we got twice as much food as two people could reasonably eat for lunch for about $45 plus tip, and like most garlic and chili bombs this food gets better after a day in the fridge.\n\nService was moderately attentive and prompt, formal if a little gruff and curt at first, but grew warmer and outright kind after we told them how much we were enjoying the food. So I think the waitstaff and food runners take pride in their business. \n\nDecor was fairly basic but nice, and pretty clean for a moderately priced Asian restaurant in the Richmond District -- it's made to look like the courtyard of an old style Korean village with tile roofs, dark and atmospheric even in the foggy lunchtime daylight.\n\nI'm definitely going back, this is a new go-to spot, this and My Tofu House. The main drawback, unfortunately, is parking. This is a very, very hard neighborhood to find a parking space anytime of the week. The mini business district is mostly surrounded by unmetered residential streets, so the local residents leave their vehicles in the same place for hours and days at a time. It's not near a major public transportation line. So just use your parking karma, or be prepared to park a few blocks away and walk. Or take a Lyft.", "author": "Gil S."}

Heads up: This dish's sauce is on the sweet sauce so I'd eat it with the rice.\n\nThe Seafood Pancake was crispy and had really long scallion pieces so it made eating a little more of a hassle.

The pancake also had a good mix of seafood in it so they weren't stingy on the ingredients.\n\nThe Spicy Rice Cake was good, but for someone who could barely handle Sriracha, it was too spicy for me (it was a medium spicy as well). I could only eat a few pieces. =(\n\nAt the end of your meal you also get a sweet rice dessert drink.

I would highly recommend this place, though keep in mind, parking my be hard in the area. Korean Tour buses also stop here a lot, so the line might be longer than expected. Their hot pots are also delicious, and some may take longer, but it's worth the wait!", "author": "Denise D."}

Presented on an iron platter, the meat was not caramelized, and the onions remained raw-looking. did they forget to heat the iron platter? strange.\n\nBanchan was fresh. Not the best or most flavorful that I've tried, but appreciated just how fresh. The selection and number they give here is bit less than say....Jong Ga on other side of the bay. Seafood pajeon: too thick. needed to be bit more crispy, and the coarse cut of the ingredients.. didn't care for.\n\nLucky for us, we made reservations for a large table, and the Friday night was not crazy, affording us the ability to non-yell our conversations.

From the guy who was actively ignoring me while I tried to put my name down to wait, to the waitress who I requested the steamed egg as part of my banchan and forgot and gave me the tofu soup instead and when I told her I ordered the steamed egg she basically was like tough luck, next time kid. But I have to admit, the kalbi here is pretty good. Sigh. It's got a lovely marinade and is beautifully charred and that charcoal flavor is the only thing that would bring me back. The dokbokgi is the simplest I've ever seen served, just the rice cakes and sauce for $10which is not worth it to me. Again, the kalbi was the only thing I'd come back for.

First score, the base price is several dollars cheaper than some other places and includes decent sundubujjigae (tofu soup) for the table and a sweet rice drink dessert in addition to the usual panchan. They serve you lettuce leaves if you want them to eat your BBQ along with a rather small portion of gochugang (but I'm sure I could have got more if I'd asked).\n\nThe seafood I wouldn't order again; it was about 80% vegetables and 20% seafood. Other than that, really no complaints. Well, one maybe: the lighting sure is bright.

We were seated right away regardless.  I like that.  For some reason I hate it when a restaurant tells me I have to wait until my entire party is present before we are seated.  \n\nThe restaurant was *empty* at 6 when we arrived.  When we left close to 8 it was packed without a free table.  A TOUR BUS dropped off lots of people and things got REAL up in there.  \n\n*  Establishment\n-  Encouraging\n\nCool looking place.  Seems very clean.  Interesting decor.  Felt very nice.   \n\n*  Service\n-  Discouraging (kinda)\n\nThe guy who seated us and took our order was a joy.  He seemed very nice and led us through some questions gladly.  Then he was off to do other things while the food was brought by a very no-nonsense lady in a ponytail.  \n\nI keep getting told that there's some \"cultural\" reason why the service is tense and sparse.  Like that just acceptable elsewhere in the world.  (I ain't never been nowheres else so maybe that's true) but I don't get it.  \n\nAn establishment like this could look at \"stopping at a patrons table\" like an unnecessary nuisance.  It felt like this place did look at it that way.  I get that stopping to ask of anyone needs anything - well - gets people telling you what they need - and that means you have to do more stuff.  I can see why people hate doing more stuff.  Like, I would have loved another single-serve bowl of rice.  No way.  \n\nBut there's also a few upsides to the establishment, no?  For much of the meal myself and others wanted a soda.  If this was a more accessible thing, we could have got what we needed, and the establishment would recognize a bit of profit too, no?  Six canned sodas at $2 each adds up.  Then there's the \"higher tip for good service\" benefit to the establishment too.  \n\nThis place wanted neither the reputation, better tip or profitable ring.  They just wanted to never do more stuff my going near our table.  I call that bad service, but for some reason, it seems to be expected here.  \n\nSo - lower your expectations - like I was told to - and enjoy the food. \n\n*  Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation\n-  Outstanding \n\nThe food was spectacular.  Bright, fresh, vibrant and flavorful.  My sister ordered for the table, and I have NO CLUE what I was eating, but it was dynamite.  \n\nI do remember the kimchee pancakes (incredible) and the pork (wow!)\n\nThe rest of the food was indeed memorable but I wouldn't have a clue what to call it.  \n\n*  What I'll remember\n\nDat pork!  And kimchee pancakes!  Wow!\n\n*  What I can't wait to forget\n\nWondering if they were mad at us because of their scowls and avoidance of eye contact or table maintenance.", "author": "Peter L."}

We're not the only ones who think this - a couple sitting behind us was from Europe, and the sizable round table beside us was having a birthday party.\n\nI sang along a little bit during the cake song, but I don't remember if I clapped after the candle blowout. I was honestly too consumed by the food to focus on much else. I was taken from the get-go when muk came out among our banchan. I didn't have to ask for it or anything - it's standard, as further evidenced by its photo in the menu with a factoid bubble explaining what banchan is.\n\nOn top of that, pajeon was one of the other banchan. My friend pointed out that, where applicable, the side dishes were generously chunky. Namely, the fish cake, spicy radish, and marinated cucumber were cut a little bigger than at other places. It was like way back when Campbell's introduced their \"Chunky\" range, enlarging everything about the soups I'd always eaten before.\n\nThe theme of bigger pieces carried over to my entree as well. The al (roe) clusters in my aljjigae were mostly heftier than in other renditions I've had. It's been so long since I've seen hot oxtail soup that I can't say how the cuts in my friend's bowl compared to those at other places.\n\nOther goodies were on the menu, such as intestine, crab soup, beef bone soup, and pork belly, at least one of which will doubtlessly be on our table during a future visit.\n\nThe beverage selection included items not at other restaurants, such as Daepo, Maechuisun, and what might've been the pomegranate wine I've seen at some Korean groceries. This third one I don't know for certain because we didn't get it - I just briefly saw it through the refrigerated glass case and thought I recognized the bottle shape.\n\nI'd say the only hiccup in our service was that, by the time we'd received everything else and made headway into eating our food, our appetizer was still absent. We caught one of our three servers to ask about the modeudwigim we'd ordered.\n\nServer: \"What?\"\nMe: \"Modeudwigim.\"\nServer: \"I'm sorry?\"\nMe: \"Mo deu dwi gim?\"\n\nI wasn't succeeding, so I gestured for a menu so I could flip to the page.\n\nMe: \"Ah, modeumdwigim.\"\nServer: \"ModeumTWIgim.\"\n\nDaaaaaanng, I can't get some slack around here? Truthfully speaking, I'm glad people are looking out for my pronunciation. (But was it that much of a stretch to infer what I wanted?)\n\nMaybe it had been waiting; not but a minute or two afterward, the plate was at hand. The pieces of battered and fried vegetables + shrimp were oversized too, even more so than the banchan and entree. The zucchini(?) and potatoes were big blocks that nearly defied chopsticks, and even the shrimp surprised us.\n\nToward the end of the meal, we were one of three, then two, pairs in the restaurant still eating. Around then, our three servers sat down two tables away for their own dinner. Glancing in their direction, who did I see but a grandma strutting out of the kitchen. Breaking the attire guidelines of the other workers, she had on a bright sea green shirt and an orange multicolored apron. A second grandma appeared shortly with a more earthen but nonetheless hodgepodge look.\n\nMaybe it's they who make the food.

It's easy for a bibimbap to taste bland, but this one had tons of flavor, and I especially loved the beef in it.\n\nTofu soup:  So this tasted good, but it was so much smaller than the bibimbap?!  When it came out, my boyfriend thought it was a complementary tofu soup rather than the one he ordered.  I didn't expect it to be so small!\n\nAll in all, Han Il Kwan is a solid Korean gem.

I like their jap chae too (again, one of the best in SF), but the only thing that's lacking I've found is their bibimbap. It isn't really much to write home about.\n\nSo yeah, if you're looking for a nice KBBQ night out with your friends, HIK is the place to go. It might be worth it to call in advance, as they will inevitably fill up (especially when those Korean tour groups come!) We were so stuffed with KBBQ once that I got on the Balboa bus shortly thereafter, and literally passed out cold until the bus was close to Embarcadero. \n\nDinner is about $25-30 pp, depending on what you get. When you have a big enough of a group they won't make everyone get an entree. \n\nLUNCH\n\nI actually think HIK is the best for lunch, because they have AMAZING lunch specials at a ridiculous price. For LESS THAN 10 DOLLARS (pre-tx/tip), you get all of their dinner KBBQ mainstays (kalbi, spicy pork, chicken) or bibimbap complete with:\n\n-6 or 7 _generous_ portions of banchans (usually 7)\n-a small slice of korean pancake (this is actually not much to write home about)\n-your OWN soondobu soup\n-rice\n-a tea kettle full of hot steamy barley tea\n-sweet rice drink aftewards\n\nI actually eat a lot, but this is a lot of food even for me. The key is that HIK's banchan portions are huge, and they really fill you up. This, plus a bowl of rice, a bowl of soondobu soup, AND a good serving of grilled meat...tell me how you're still hungry. It's so much food that when I worked at the VA, I would come here only once a week because it was such a rich lunch...but I loved it nonetheless :)\n\nA note about their banchan: my absolute favorite here is their marinated cucumbers. It really seems all they do is brine the cucumbers, then toss it in sesame oil, but it's incredibly tasty here. The cucumbers are always juicy and at the right level of sweetness, to a level that I haven't seen emulated by Korean restaurants elsewhere. Their radish kimchi is also quite excellent, and their fish cakes as well depending on the day.\n\nI honestly think HIK is better than 90% of restaurants in NYC K-town, and I haven't really seen anything that compares in Manhattan proper without getting to Queens. I only hope to be living close to a place like this someday :)", "author": "Chris S."}

The reason I am giving it a 3 instead of a 4 is because I think the food was just okay. It's probably more of a 3.5. \n\nSo we were seated quickly once we entered. We didn't sit at a table with a grill because we didn't feel like doing the BBQ.\n\nSo I ordered a tofu soup and my friend ordered the bibimbap. I think my tofu soup was okay, no egg came with it. I like the bibimbap overall. I think I prefer that over my soup. \n\nI came on a weekend night, so I felt like it was busy. They were quick with the service and served us in a timely manner. We asked for bunch of refills on the side dishes, I feel like I can eat it all day.\n\nAt the end of the meal, they gave us some dessert drink I didn't care for.

The portions were huge and they give plenty of side dishes that can be a meal in itself. This restaurant gives out \"on the house\" items - such as seafood pancake, japchae, or a bowl of eggs.\n\nI got the short ribs, jap chae, pot stickers and rice. Doesn't sound like too much but it does when you stack on about 8-9 side dishes. No BBQ because it tastes better when they cook! It gets a little busy around dinner time and the meat plates can run up to $30 a dish. Although the price is a little steep, they do a good job offsetting it with a lot of food as their portions are quite large and can fill anyone up. I'm a guy with a large appetite and I ended up having to take the food home.\n\nIf you're ever in the Richmond district, I recommend giving this place a try.

My family and I were extremely tired from moving in my brother all day and all we wanted was some comfort food. Han Il Kwan provided that for us and it might be the most authentic Korean restaurant in the city. There is a parking spot only for tour buses. That's how popular this restaurant is. When we got there, we had to wait a good 45 minutes also but once we got seated, the service was very good. Food took forever to come out though and totally out of order. \n\nTheir banchan service is phenomenal. We never had to ask for refills because they constantly refilled it for us. We ordered short ribs stew, yukaejang (spicy beef soup), an order of galbi (marinated short ribs) and soontofu (tofu soup). Things came out one at a time which was very annoying but they were swamped beyond belief. I never order galbi at restaurants because they're too sweet but it was pretty good here. Tasty with some rice. I didn't care too much for their soontofu. It was good  but I've had better soontofu elsewhere. Their yukaejang was delicious. Filled with beef and vegetables and so delicious. The dish that we were most anticipating was their short ribs stew but this really took way too long to come out. We were ready to cancel and go when it came out. The restaurant gave us a free steamed egg to compensate for the time but by that time we were already full. The stew was loaded with perfectly cooked potatoes and vegetables. The only thing that was wrong with it was the sweet factor. Over the top sweet. They really need to cut back on the sugar there. \n\nOverall, for Korean food in the city, it really isn't bad. It doesn't compare to the food in LA, but I would be back if I was in the city.

We got the Kalbi, Burgolgi, Seafood Pancake, Bibimbap, Seafood Tofu Soup, and the Beef Short Rib Stew. The Kalbi and Burgolgi was very tender and was well marinated, we were also able to grill it at the table on our own. The Beef Short Rib Stew was the best out of the entire meal, as it was very flavorful and tender. The Seafood Pancake had a bit too much green onions. The Seafood Tofu Soup and Bibimbap was standard. The service here was also very quick, as they brought out our orders very quick and our tea was also refilled frequently. They also helped us grill the first round of Kalbi and Burgolgi which was nice. It really feels like you are eating at someones house when the waiters serve you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-10-22", "description": "I really wanted to love this place because of all the good reviews from my Yelp friends, but I couldn't cause of the service I got :( \n\nI love Korean BBQ! ..but my bf isn't a huge fan of it. After eating AYCE on Wednesday, I still wanted more! He finally agreed to eat with me and we both wanted to try some place new! So, we stumbled upon Han il Kwan on Yelp. We arrived half an hour before closing and lets say they hated us the moment we walked in. \n\nOkay, I guess it was my bad for coming in half an hour before closing (with the restaurant already have 4-5 parties), but it doesn't mean you should treat us with an attitude. When we stepped in, the guy already told us that they were about to close, but we still agreed to stay. \n\nHe sat us in the corner which is a kinda awkward seating location but kinda cool at the same time, because for parties of 2-5, there are booths available. In the corner behind the booths, there's only a table and 4 chairs - pretty secluded. For bigger parties, there are tables in the middle that you can be seated in, and they include a grill if you like to cook your own food! Before he gave us our menus, he asked us if we knew what we wanted. Since it was our first time here, obviously we didn't. When he did hand it to us, he stood by our table, kinda giving us this impression that we should hurry up and order what we want. Reading the menu was confusing cause I think they put the dishes into categories (i.e. Lunch, Grilling, etc. but when you look at the dinner menu, they don't have Bulgogi or Galbi on there because it's in the grilling section.. Ask your waiter if you're confused on how it works!) My bf and I ordered from the grilling section but it was cooked in the kitchen, cause we weren't seated with a grill. There was no 'cook in kitchen' surcharge for us, cause I think we came super late, so you should make sure if you don't want a surprise! \n\nAfter we placed our orders, our banchans came out and this consisted of bean sprouts, fish cakes, broccoli/carrots, and more (about 8-9 banchan - there's also tofu soup). The fish cake here was a little different as the color was lighter than usual, but it tasted about the same. During our meal, they gave us 2 mini pancakes but it wasn't all that great, and when one of the ladies working there gave us our tofu soup, she kinda spilled it and didn't even care or apologize. Yep, they definitely hated us. \n\nFood!\n*Before I start, I will say that the two dishes my bf & I ordered were both DRY (overcooked), and lacked presentation to it. Looked as if it was just thrown on there. Canned soda beverages are $1.50. \n\nBeef Rib-Eye aka Bulgogi - $22\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/han-il-kwan-san-francisco?select=r7wzh4g-x7RowxRlF91UZg#KGBTo1_zbmEgaknBFr9p4Q\nThough our dishes tasted dry, the good part to it was that it was marinated and definitely had flavor. The overcooked-ness didn't make the dish taste as good, but I'm hoping to try it again next time .. and hopefully it'll be better! \n\nSpicy Pork - $20 \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/han-il-kwan-san-francisco?select=r7wzh4g-x7RowxRlF91UZg#oGX-nGMG35vw52_2NkhZkg\nI love spicy pork! This dish was actually pretty spicy, and I couldn't finish it. Again, I think it would've been better if the dish wasn't overcooked and dry. I would recommend ordering this and Bulgogi! \n\nEven though we pretty much received crappy service just because we came in late, some of the waiters were a little nice and still checked in on us. I think part of the reason why they rushed us was because so they can start eating dinner at the restaurant. I think I will give this place another chance .. but probably not anytime soon, and make sure to come earlier. \n\nFor what we had, our bill came out to be about $50 for two people, excluding tip.", "author": "Mandy G."}

Service, quality of food, and price make it a spot that I will definitely continue to return to on a regular basis.\n\nAt first, when you look at the menu prices they will seem daunting. However, keep in mind, that most of the BBQ meats are portioned for 6-8 people per plate. Often times, large groups benefit from ordering from their set group menu since you get the widest selection of their menu. The Chap-Chae is absolutely delicious fresh out from the kitchen. The sizzling spicy pork and bulgogi waft into your nose and make you hunger for more. The bibimbap - yum! I have eaten here eaten here a few times, and I still haven't had everything on the menu. I look forwarding to eating it all.\n\nService is top notch for any restaurant. Servers are all very friendly, knowledgeable, and approachable.\n\nLocation is what you would expect for quiet little Richmond - very little parking, but accessible by bus, and tucked away among the apartments. and homes of the locals. My suggestion if you are driving out there is parking at Geary and 19th or Anza and 19th - you will have better luck. Also, it might help to walk off some of the calories gained from eating all the delicious food.\n\nFinally, the restaurant itself is quite large as it sports the main dining room with several booths + large tables, and a back room with some more tables.

This was very very refreshing!!!\n\nTip: Don't wear anything you don't want to smell in, it is a BBQ place so you will come out smelling like what you eat.", "author": "Ian C."}

The place was about half full at 1:00 p.m., it seems like they were a little understaffed, but the two of us were seated in just a couple of minutes.  \n\nWe were ready to order soon after but it took about 15 minutes for anyone to come by our table again.  When we did order, the food came out rather quickly.  \n\nSide dishes (free): bean sprouts, kim chi, cucumbers, tofu, something starchy/crunchy, pancake.  the sides were okay, nothing was spectacular though.  The pancake was probably my favorite item.\n\nBeef rib eye ($10.50): the beef itself was a little bit dry and not that flavorful.  It wasn't bad, but not as good as I was hoping.  The portion is very fair though.  It came with a bowl of rice and a tofu soup too.  It is plenty of food for one person.\n\nSeafood stone pot ($9.95): bits of seafood, and a fried egg, with rice.  You can add your own hot sauce and mix as desired.  I have never actually ordered this, but it was my friend's suggestion.  It was good and very filling.  The bits of crisped rice are the best.\n\nDessert (free): sugary-watery-rice.  It is served in a plastic cup and unlike anything I have ever had before, but I guess this is common with korean food.  It was a bit sweet for me, but my friend liked it.\n\nOverall, the price is very fair and you get plenty of food (at least for lunch).  It's a decent option; but beware that the service can be a bit slow at lunch.  It took about 20 minutes to get the bill after we were done eating.

It's located on Balboa and 19th Ave and is very unassuming as it's located in the middle of the more residential part of the Inner Richmond.  You can find street parking around the area, as there's not much going on commercially around the restaurant.\n\nWe stopped by in the middle of the dinner rush (around 8 pm) and had a to wait only a short while before we were seated.  There's surprisingly a lot of space and it can fit large parties (we had a group of 6).  However, after we sat down, it seemed that we had to a wait a while to get any service (taking our order, receiving our food, getting our side dishes).  Pretty understandable giving the crowded dining time.\n\nI had a combination of the Soft Tofu soup and  Stone Pot Bibimbap.  Both were very excellent and provided a nice complement to one another.  For the soft tofu soup, it came out piping hot, so be aware of cooling it off a little before guzzling it down.  It was just the right amount of kick, but still very flavorful.  The Bibimbap was very standard and you could add as much hot sauce as you would like.  I suggest also adding in some kim chee or the other sides to add to the dish.  As for my friends, they thoroughly enjoyed their meals ranging from the squid stir fry, to a noodle dish, to kalbi.  We also had a side of hot sake which really helped to let the good time role.\n\nAs with all Korean BBQ places, be ready for your entire body and clothes to absorb the korean food smell for the rest of your day/night.  However, it's always worth it to satisfy your taste buds!", "author": "Robert T."}

Service is okay and forgetful so constantly remind them that you are there and you need stuff.  We ordered the cook-it-yourself beef and chicken, seafood pancake, seafood spicy soup for a total of over $100.  Mind you the beef itself is $29,99 an order.  They do overload you with condiments such as the sprouts, kim chee, pancake, tofu and several others.  You might be pleased with that. They had good unique tea and the ice water was fresh.  Cooking the beef was simple but the chicken takes a while.  Korean is very expensive and very filling especially the pancakes.  Suggestion:  I would skip the pancake overall at this place.  I went to Soju tonight and their pancake was light and greasy but here at Han Il Kwan the pancakes are very heavy.  If you do order the pancakes, save it for last and get your fill on all the protein and veggies first or else you won't eat anything else.  The spicy soup was overloaded with scallops and octopus.  It also had shrimp, mussels and fish i think.  Very good.  Although it is like $18 but if you love seafood, this is a good item to purchase because you kind of get your $$$'s worth.  A very good friend mentioned that this place is expensive and indeed it is.  I'm sure there are other reasonable Korean joints out there, we just have to find them.  Enjoy!!!", "author": "Chris S."}

This is my summary of this restaurant: that restaurant that tour buses stop by just because they have contracts with Korean tourist agencies. Nothing more. I am Korean, I love Korean food, and I have eaten at many different Korean places around the world. This place is a solid 2-star restaurant. We got 10 banchans (side dishes), which is relatively generous around the Bay Area. However, that was the end of anything good about this place. \nWe had four people in the party, and each person's food arrived at different times with an average of 10 minute intervals. So by the time I  done with my Naeng Mying, my husband was still waiting for his Galbee tang. \nSo was the food at least good? No. Galbee tang was so bland that we had to ask for salt. Naengmyung arrived without vinegar and mustard, and I had to ask for it twice before I got them. \nBanchans refill is an essential part of Korean dining. We asked for the refills precisely 5 times over 45 min period, and we finally got our banchans refilled. The only thing is that we were all done by the time banchans arrived. We could have stayed for dinner to finish the banchans, but we were finished with this place by then.\n\nI guess the serving ladies have super sensors for customer disappointment (or this is always expected?). We were given a freebie dish. But sorry, that didn't up the stars.", "author": "Jane M."}

Even down in So Cal I never really go out to eat at Korean restaurants just because I don't see the point in paying money for food I can eat for free at home where the quality of ingredients surpasses any restaurant in LA and is made with extra love from mom.  ;] \n\nHowever, for some reason before I went on my last trip to SF I had the biggest craving for dolsot bibimbap (mixed rice with veggies, meat, egg and spicy chili paste cooked in a stone bowl).  I tried to ignore my craving, hoping it would subside after a few days, but no... I had to surrender.  \n\nTo be honest I was a little wary of going to eat Korean in SF as competition isn't that high amongst Korean restaurants as it is in LA so one might think that their A game is equivalent to LA's B game in regards to Korean food.  I did however, take note that Han Il Kwan has an impressive rating on Yelp that made me a little more comfortable of trying it out.  \n\nService was okay to good.  The older lady was alright and got the job done when it came to waitressing... the younger male was really cool & friendly towards my friend and I without giving us a stink face when we asked for extra banchan.\n\nSo here's the low down on the show down...\n\nDolsot Bibimbap - lunch portion was a huge portion... came with all the usual suspects of assorted veggies, pieces of beef, rice, fried egg and a squirt bottle of Korean chili paste.  I asked for a little side of sesame oil as I couldn't taste any when I took my first bite.  Overall it was a standard bowl of dolsot bibimbap, tasting better after I added the oil in combination with my heavy load of chili paste.  Not out of this world and not unsatisfying as if definitely satiated my craving.\n\nKalbi - It was okay... I don't know if it's because I've been spoiled with my mom's own need to make kalbi every time she sees that short ribs are on sale at the market or if because my tastebuds have become jaded living in LA.  Not disgusting, not amazeballs... more like a..\"these shall do\" kind of reaction.\n\nTofu soup - (Not soon tofu, but a spicy soup with veggies & tofu) Comes free with your lunch meal, I was pleasantly surprised with this soup.  Usually I don't really like soups like these so I didn't really taste my portion till later on in my meal.  It was quite tasty with the chunks of zucchinis I really enjoyed and a perfect side to go with my bibimbap.\n\nNokdoboochim (pancake) - It's always a plus for me when a restaurant gives any type of Korean style pancake as a complimentary appetizer.  These were the kind made out of grounded beans, they might have been free but they tasted like they were worth paying for. \n\nBanchan - Typical side dishes you'd get at any Korean spot...acorn jelly with seasoned soy sauce, kimchi, saut\u00e9ed oden, bean sprouts/soy beans sprouts, pickled veggies, and I forget what others.  None of them really stood out for me, but then again I was more focused on attacking my entree which was seriously a big portion.  \n\nAfter meal dessert drink (shikhye) - For real, super brownie points after giving the BEST Korean drink -better than soju, makgoli, bekseju, mekju, etc.  Sweet malted rice drink...the Korean's version of horchata perhaps???  BOMB.  No better way to end a Korean feast.  \n\nI don't know if I'll come back just because I still don't know how I feel about eating Korean in SF when I can just drive over to Ktown in LA where each restaurant is competing with the restaurant next door specializing in the same damn thing as them.    My meal, overall was standard, nothing blew me out of the water...okay maybe the dessert beverage did, but hey that should just be the icing on the cake right?  I suppose if I were to be randomly craving Korean in SF again this would be my first pick because service was good and the food didn't disappoint.", "author": "Priscilla C."}

But last night was the last time i will be dining there... Through out the years we have been coming here to dine and I refered so many people, tourists, friends to this restaurant, but from now on, i will just tell them NOT WORTH IT.\n*Last couple times, no matter what time you come, they ALWAYS have tour buses. And no, its not just 1... I remember arriving at 5, 6, 7, and i wait for 1+ hour minimum each time. At least 3 tour buses rolling in each time, 20 mins for each bus, cleaning, 20 mins, cleaning and another 20 mins... They dont seat anyone during this time, maybe couple tables... But they seat tourist all around restaurant and it just seems like a Sunday Farmers market, while we all scrumble and stand around the door, trying to all fit and not be in the way...\n*Yesterday night we arrived at 7 pm. Due to tour bus and parking, 4 people of our party of 6 went in to put the name down, i circled 5-6 times, which is at least 15 mins to find a parking. Parked, went in, i wanted to ask how long is the wait. So i asked the owner, he was like i dont even know, we have buses, people waiting and some reservations! So i dont know. Ok... He was like well, at LEAST 45 mins... OK. I looked at the waitlist, we were maybe the 5-7th in the row. And behind us were at Least 5-7 parties. So like middle of the line. It was so crowded inside, the tour bus was wrappling up, they will start seating reservations and people, so we were outside. It was an exceptional HOT day in SF, over 80, almost 85 all the way, and suddenly it started cooling off. We did have jackets and stuff, but it was coming down to 60, a bit windy. We kept going in every 5-10 mins to check on the line. Even we left the phone number, i dont recall them ever calling. At 8 pm, its been an hour, we asked again how much more, the owner says, like i told you around 7:30, 45 mins, its gonna be 15 more mins... I understand, but he didnt know we put our names way 30 mins before that! So 1 hour in, he says another 15 mins. Ok. We went inside to wait, because the party of 5 after us on the list are standing right at the counter and pushing and trying to get seated before. \nOver 20 mins passed, he seats us at this BIG round table. Which fits 10-12 people. We asked for a BBQ table. So i kindly walk to owner and ask him can u get us any of those 2 side tables, the ones by the window, the cooking ones, there were 2 empty, they are cleaning them. So I explain to him our party of 6 includes 2 kids, 1 is 3, another is 7, its gonna be really hard for them to reach anything! We want to long narrow table, so it would be easier for parents and for kids. Plus, it was windy, and they keep the door wide open! And our table was right by the door, the kids were sick last couple weeks, adjusting to SF weather, can we get the table by the windows, so it doesnt blow on your back! 5 mins debate, he was rude and kept saying no! And excuse was those tables are reserved. Specificaly those. Can u give ours to them? No. Because they only have 3 people, but we have kids, can you please understand its to hard for them to reach any salad plates. No no and no. Which is ok. We seat down. But wait for it...! The party of 5 after us got seated at the non cooking table... After 5 mins, he seats them to that reserved table! Are you kidding me!?!? This is absolutely RUDE!!! Of course we were mad! So we call a server and tell her, this is not fair, why they got moved there, if you say it was not available, make it off limits to everyone! At this point, the server tells another server in Korean, then they go talk to owner... And guess what he did?! HE WAIVED HIS HAND AT US LIKE I DONT GIVE A SH***!!! And the server who came back was the one served us many many times, really nice lady, she says apology, but they had reservation... Hm...No.. They were there the whole time! Excuse me, but purple/blue plaid shirt is kinda noticeble, who is just at the counter each time i check the list! So she says, oh, i dont know, sorry for this... Honestly, at that point of couse we didnt say anything, since the owner was so big on customer service, what if he kick us out, if we didnt have my uncle's family of 4 with us, we would of left! But the kids were so tired and hungry after the day visit in SF, they wanted to try this amazing korean bbq and go back. We ordered, eat, dissapointed, still leave a decent tip, even i feel like i would tip for than 10% for this bullshit, and said GOODBYE to this place. \n*Food was so blend and flavorless. We ordered Kalbi, Marinated Rib Eye, Pork belly, a fried fish, fried noodles, hot stone bi bim bap, kimchee jiigae, Yukgaejang. Meat were fine. Fish was not chewy, not good at all. Bi bim bap wasnt tasty at all. Kimchee was not spicy at all, and my favorite yukgaejang was so flavorless. \nHey, if you cant handle people, reservation and tour bus, dont do them all!!

Best part is the tour bus parking out front so no customers can park. For the huge tour buses of tourists arriving at their door ferreted into a back room so they can make more money. Horrendous restaurant.", "author": "Sebastian C."}

The same lady brought us our menus and then left. For the next 15 minutes, she completely ignored my bf and I as she walked from table to table checking on all of the other Asian-occupied tables. She even took the order of customers that (were Asian) arrived after us. At that point my bf was done and ready to leave, as he felt a lack of respect. But I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, and waited for her to come to our table. However after she took the order of the people that came after us, she started walking away and then another lady waved her down and told her to come to our table. However, she walked right past our table and then when I tried to get her attention she put her hand up to keep me from speaking because she was helping the people next to us. I was finally ready to leave at that point. I stood up to leave and the lady finally asked me what I wanted and I just told her we were leaving. Never coming to this place again.

I wish I got the name of my server, he was such a sweetheart!\n\nwe ordered 3 things - mom had classic bibimbap (w beef), shared the seafood pancake, and i had the combination seafood tofu soup.\n\nbibimbap - came stone hot (yes, HOT and not cold in this case)! I've tasted my share of bibimbaps and you know how sometimes the rice would be SUPER mushy, especially after mixing the veggies/egg/sauce? well this was super bomb, not mushy at all and the crispy rice at the bottom was, well, crispy .. and not just super chewy. \n\nseafood pancake - about 2 pieces of this really will fill you up. this came in 8-10 pieces, are pretty heavy and served with this tasty dipping sauce. Pieces of octopus were sprinkled within along with long pieces of green onions. so good!!\n\ncombo seafood tofu soup - wasn't listed on the menu so I asked and I received! BEST TOFU SOUP EVER. PERIOD. you have to wait like, 10 minutes to eat it though cause it comes smokin hot! I advise using the little plates they give you to help cool your soup. otherwise you'd never leave the place. in the soup were bits and pieces of octopus, clam whole 2-3 pieces of shrimp and duh, tofu. in every bite I had the perfect melody of seafood and tofu. never wished once that there was more of one or the other. oh, and i don't recall it being super spicy either, which is good on my end cause I'm not a huge fan of spicy. however if you are, I'm sure they'd be more than happy to accommodate. \n\nso uh, first time here, we obviously didn't know how much food this would be!!! long story short we barely made a dent in our plates and packed the rest! I had enough lunch for another dinner and 2 lunches!!\n\nto top off this great experience, they serve this home made sweet rice drink. ok, it was weird at first. I know there are rice puddings and rice desserts out there but this was like, white rice which my palate associates w savory. I drank the water part of it - no joke about the sweet!

I was very happy to find Han Il Kwan though!  \n\nMy first time was with a group of 4 and we came at an odd lunch hour, so it wasn't crowded at all.  We ordered the seafood pancake, spicy hot beef soup, kimchee tofu soup, and clay pot bibimbop.  I'm not sure if it's because we were super hungry, but we were really satisfied and happy with most of the food!  I ordered the tofu soup, which was subpar, to myself but had buyer's remorse when I saw my friend's spicy hot beef soup.  Everything was a huge portion though so we were plenty full and had lots of leftovers at the end.\n\nSecond time was recently when I went with a bigger group for dinner, so reservations had to be made.  This time I made sure to order the spicy beef soup and shared the bibimbop with a friend.  It might've been the fact that it get super packed for dinner, but the soup wasn't as good as I remembered.  Bibimbop, in general, never really stands out to me but I couldn't complain about Han Il Kwan's version.  \n\nThe reason my review is mostly neutral but I'm giving it 4 stars though is because of it's banchan.  You could get full off of just that if you wanted because they give you SO MUCH!  I love the variety and it's because of Han Il Kwan that I can eat kimchee by itself now (always had to have it with something else before).  I start drooling just thinking of their banchan.

Plus you don't *completely* smell like Korean BBQ when you leave.\n\nI still don't quite understand why Korean tourists would travel to California and then, as a group, patronize a Korean restaurant (I eat McDonalds only when Im alone and cant read the menus) - but that's none of my business. A great place for Korean food in SF.", "author": "Super F."}

If I can I usually come here with my friends during the lunch special, because the items are really cheap. They will even serve you a FREE dish of tofu soup and a variety of side dishes.\n\nWhen I go at night I usually go for the Kal Bi Chim and it is absolutely DELICIOUS. I've ordered it every time I've been there and still have not gotten sick of it.\n\nDuring the night, parking may be harder to find in the area though. Also Friday and Saturday nights are usually the packed nights, and you should expect a wait that MAY range to 40 mins :\\ So I suggest going different times for days. The service is known for its slowness, but regardless, I'll give it a 5 stars for the food and will be going back.\n\nAnd to the people complaining about the stone bibimbap, that is HOW IT IS. It hot in the bottom for the purpose of creating the crispy rice. My friends have ALWAYS enjoyed it for that reason. So don't complain about something you don't know how it's prepared.", "author": "Harriet W."}

We waited for the bus to leave so we could park in front of the restaurant after trying to find parking for 30 mins. But wait, some guy from the restaurant runs up and says this public curb is now reserved parking for (preferred) customers. To which I said, where does it say it's reserved? He mumbled something this and that and we just drove away to park elsewhere. \n\nWe walked in and my family was already seated waiting for me and my gf. We had about 10 people and started with 3 plates of bbq (chicken, spicy pork, beef), a tofu soup, and sea food pancake. The waiter goes: you have 10 people you have to order 10 items. we told him we will add more later if we need to. He mumbles something something about not giving 10 bowls of rice and just said you have to order 10 dishes. At this point I've started to raise my voice and basically told him to fck off and put the order in. \n\nThis guy waiter was really something else. We asked him to bring bottles of Hite beers and he brings us warm ones from somewhere instead of the cold ones in the fridge. Knowing how incapable he is, I went to the fridge to change it to the cold ones myself. \n\nThe food was your typical korean bbq. I mean, you can't really screw that up since customers cook their own food right? In the end we added another soup and another beef. But seriously wtf bro waiter, don't tell your customers how to order their food. I'll just stick to the other kbbq places on geary.", "author": "Roger N."}

We had a party of five on a Saturday night, so this needs to be prefaced by saying we went at a fairly busy peak hour. However, the service was pathetic and the worst I have ever received dining out. \n\nWe had a member of our party begin waiting in line around 7. The rest of us had come in separate cars so we had to find parking, which was difficult. By the time we had arrived, it was about 7:45 and we were still waiting to be seated. About fifteen minutes later we were seated in the back room at a large table split for two groups. This was just about 8 o'clock. From there we read the menus and settled on what we wanted. \n\nHere's where the fun begins. Trying to track down a waiter to take our order is like hunting for Nessie in Ireland. We politely requested our order be taken by two separate waiters--one we asked twice--along with the host. Each replied more rudely in return, going so far as to wave us of and yell, \"YEAH! YEAH! HOLD ON!!\" While we waited for our order to be taken, the waiters brought out food to the tables around us and made MANY trips back and forth to the kitchen. This boggled me; why couldn't they take our orders back with them on one of the many trips back to the kitchen? Our table as well as the table next to ours was right on their route.\n\nTo top it all off, about ten minutes after we were seated, another party of three was seated. They were waited on, served and had their food BEFORE we were even given a chance to place our order. They came in AFTER us. \n\nThis restaurant has the WORST customer service I have ever seen. And when my friends and I eat in a group, we are generally more forgiving about wait times. However, we were not going to sit around for over half an hour, be ignored and tip them on top of the already pricey dishes. We ended up leaving at 8:30 to stares and gossip from the waiters. \n\nVerdict: The staff avoided us like North Korea avoids democracy. They've put me the wrong way. Never again!", "author": "Larry Y."}

This Richmond-hidden Korean Lunch Special really blew me away. Forget the life story, I'm just gonna get straight to the point. \n\nMy girlfriend and I came here at 3PM, in hopes that we could get some affordable Korean eats (cause we all know Korean food don't come cheap), and to our surprise, they were still serving their lunch specials (till 4PM!). Also, keep in mind that we ONLY ordered 2 items (which would be the meat entrees).\n\nKorean Pancake: [http://s3yelp2-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/00Cq0CwvXCRgPDrvDFW8oQ/l.jpg] \nWhen they placed this on our table, we thought they mixed up our order, but in fact, it was \"fer freeeee!\" (I'm assuming this was part of the incoming Banchan) Anyways, it was good -- a corn like cake which required the dipping sauce for taste. \n\nSpicy Tofu Soup: [http://s3yelp3-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/hpF8fUdNI-NRJtIRBU1FAA/l.jpg]\nThis is one of two complimentary choices you'll receive from the lunch special (steamed egg is the second choice). It was a very authentic and hearty AND SPICY kimchi flavored tofu soup. Really warmed me up on a foggy Richmond afternoon.\n\nBanchan : [http://s3yelp4-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/lFXmHqcQPjuXlMKZ_1jWlQ/l.jpg]\n7 Banchans in total and all of them were fresh. However, I was a little disappointed on their take of kimchi because I like mine DRENCHED in kimchi chili sauce. I can't complain because at this point, I was already getting full..\n\nMarinated Rib Eye Beef: $9.95 [http://s3yelp1-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/K3Nk2M5TbXJ2xxhM2qlEcg/l.jpg]\nThis was a lot of meat (and there was still another plate coming). However, quantity doesn't mean quality. The beef was good, but was slightly overcooked, which also means that it's dry.. Will be sure to ask for medium rare next time.\n\nSpicy Pork BBQ: $7.95 [http://s3yelp1-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/1t0pu15-WBZi-OipQ4N5EQ/l.jpg]\nThis was my favorite dish. It was the first thing that caught my eye on the menu and I'm glad I ordered it. The pork was very nicely seasoned, SPICY as intended, and very soft and tender. And again, large portions for just a lunch special. Even though I was stuffed, I HAD to finish it ALL!\n\nWhat's a Korean meal without everybody's favorite rice drink for dessert? [http://s3yelp3-a.akamaihd.net/bphoto/NnVCOlBF8V4PzQWMeEV2tg/l.jpg]\n\n\nOverall, the service was amazingly fast! We walked in, picked a window seat, ordered within 5 minutes, and within minutes, one by one, the food kept coming in! The employees were also very nice and courtesy. We even asked for hot sauce and, instead of a small dipping place of sauce, they gave us the whole damn bottom! Furthermore, the food was great, with the small misses.\n\nBest part yet -- a huge Korean feast for two; totaled to ONLY $19.42!!

On the other hand, I've never received SUCH shitty service at a KBBQ restaurant. It was straight up terrible. More on that later.\n\nMy boyfriend and I came hungry as hell and so stoked to have some great KBBQ in SF (a rarity!) - we ordered the marinated short ribs and the pork belly, our two favorite things to order at KBBQ joints. The pork belly was thick and juicy; it hit my craving soooo nicely! My boyfriend loved the kalbi as well. It's not quite as good as some places we like in LA but it's the big bone kind which is delicious. They give you a wide array of tasty banchans, lettuce, rice, and soft tofu soup with your order. No shortage of food, to say the least.\n\nWhat really killed the whole experience for me was the awful service. They were so cold and borderline rude, as if they just wanted us to eat and get out. We had to wave excessively to get anyone's attention and when we did they would ignore us. When they did manage to do things, they did it with attitude. We tried to be friendly and nice and they really didn't reciprocate any warmth, acting like we were a huge nuisance to be eating at their restaurant. Maybe it was just an off day, but I'm used to KBBQ places being super friendly and cheery, not like they want you to get out.. When they changed the grill there was still soap on it, and when we wiped it off, the napkin was almost completely blackened with the dirt. Also wouldn't let us take food home. What? I paid for a set amount and didn't get to enjoy all of it.\n\nAnywho. 4 stars for food, 2 for service, so 3 overall. It was pricey - after tax and tip I paid $63 for kalbi and pork belly.

Yummy banchan and spicy tofu soup that are complimentary (Can't understand why any restaurant would charge for that!) and I found that they had one of my favorites: yook hwae bibimbap (raw beef). Food is pretty good and I like that the service was fast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-09", "description": "This place Han Il Kwan is an OK little place. I would have given it more stars but the service here is really crap. The wait staff are generally rude and preoccupied with God knows what. It may also be a Korean thing..I don't know. I'm not for certain if Korea culture is one that treats others in a rude manner..but that's what this place seems to do. \n\nThe food at Han Il Kwan is decent. They give good portions and if you are fan of Korean food, I think it's pretty good. Not great, just good. I've been to a few other Korean places in the Bay Area and I found one in Oakland to be better. Only problem is it's in Oakland..and we all know what goes down in Oakland. Not a good idea folks. \n\nHan Il Kwan menu is quite extensive as most Korean places go, I like the short ribs and the chicken, I wouldn't do the sea food because quite honestly, I don't trust it. I've seen it, but I don't trust it. They also serve this wild and spicy tofu soup. It's good for a few sips but don't get too involved. \n\nThe other day I sat next to an older white American man, looking about 65 years old with white hair and fat gut. He was complaining that they gave him too much food. Go figure huh? I would think a guy like that would be complaining of the opposite. In any case, the fat guy told the waitress to take his spicy tofu soup back into the kitchen because he didn't want it. The waitress waits a few minutes and brings out a spicy tofu soup to my table. I get the idea that she gave me the fat guy's soup. As a precaution I don't take any sips, I leave it on the table and don't touch it. It's really hard for me to trust Asian places when it comes to stuff like this. Honestly, I love Asian food, but these people aren't known for their hygienics. \n\n(I once saw a roach crawling around in a Vietnamese restaurant on Balboa Street..it was right next to my table---absolutely disgusting!!) \n\nAnyways, Han Il Kwan is a decent place. The food is good, the service is horrible. The wait staff could take a lesson in manners and learning how to tend to customers...but you know, I realized at these Asian places that they actually thrive on being rude. They love to yell and spit and give people dour faces. It may work to your advantage if you're rude and mean. Just be pushy and throw things around the table, act like you own the place and be very demanding. I'm assuming that's the Asian way. \n\nI think I'll try that..see how it goes. Just don't spit in my food.", "author": "Tiffany R."}

I've heard Han Il Kwan was supposed to be really good, if not one of the best places in the city, but I really didn't think it was anything worthy of mention!\n\nThere were a combination of aggravating factors that led to my 2-star review.\n\n1. Location. Sure, I get that good food is often a trek but this place was not worth it! Either you have to sit on a bus (or two) for over an hour, or drive and spend 15-20 minutes finding parking. Not fun.\n\n2. Service. The wait staff were perfectly courteous but they were severely understaffed! It was hard to get their attention after our initial round of food came. We wanted to get more tea/water, order more banchan, and check on the status of the rest of our order. It took forever! Also, at most Korean places that let you bbq at your table, the wait staff usually takes care of the meat for us. Either it wasn't Han Il Kwan's protocol or they were too busy. Either way, I feel like the price of the food should include that part of the service, even if we were perfectly capable of cooking the meat ourselves. I also didn't like the fact that they didn't come to change our grill plate.\n\n3. Banchan. Nothing to write home about. I've definitely had better quality and quantity at other places! We chose the soondoobu and it was not good. It wasn't even hot.\n\n4. Meat. Quality was not good. Our kalbi was thin and the lean meat to fat ratio was lopsided and unevenly distributed. When it was grilled, it didn't turn an appetizing color (and that's my proxy for how  fresh the meat is). The portion was pretty small too. The bulgogi was okay. Spicy pork was definitely spicy, but the marinade wasn't evenly distributed. There were slices that didn't get much marinade at all.\n\n5. Everything else. This is just me being nitpicky but as nothing else was that good, this only worsened the situation. The napkin was really thin and Korean food can get messy. The cups for tea and water were really small - you take two sips and your cup is empty! Gotta refill it... oh but wait, there's no tea in the teapot and they're not around to refill it. The door never seems to close so half of me was getting blasted by the cold outside air and the other half scalded by the heat from the grill.\n\nI definitely wouldn't trek out to the Richmond for this place again. I'd rather pay 50% more for expensive but really good food in NY.", "author": "Sherry L."}

Just know that the waiter made all of us feel as if we were supposed to accommodate him (and his \"I don't want to be here serving you\" attitude). \n\nIn terms of the food, it's nothing special. The banchan selection was scarce and it wasn't as yummy as other places (Oh and the waiter wouldn't bring out the only banchan that tasted good) and the kalbi was on the too sweet side, more so that other bay area Korean restaurants which are usually sweet because they typically don't cater to Koreans.  Also, their grill set up is horrible for kalbi since it's not a mesh type of grill so the kalbi marinade burns much faster and have to constantly change the grill (which the waiter wasn't too trilled about!!)\n\nIn summary, I will never return to this establishment.", "author": "Chris S."}

I absolutely love Korean food, and being one of San Francisco's best Korean BBQ restaurants, I decided to try it. There were large groups of Korean tourists coming out of buses, and this caused us to stand waiting for about 10 minutes. The whole restaurant was literally just Koreans, and my family were the only white people there. Now this is a GREAT sign. No white tourists = GREAT authentic cuisine. \n\nWe were seated by a kind waitress with a BBQ table. I immediately ordered the Kalbi (my favorite). My parents ordered the Seafood BBQ plate. My little sister ordered the Bulgogi. \n\nWhen our food came, I was ready to dig in. The Kalbi was amazing, and same for the Bulgogi. The Seafood was average Seafood. The Banchan here was very tasty, and had a wide variety compared to other Korean BBQ places I have been to in San Francisco. \n\nAfter we were done eating, I noticed I had the BIGGEST food baby.

We came here on a Saturday night and the place was packed. I liked how they put some thought into the design, making it look somewhat like a temple. Luckily our wait wasn't too long and we were seated by one of the booths.\nTo me, the banchan (side dishes) are just as important as the main dishes, and the banchan at Han II Kwan was excellent. It was fresh and they had a lot of variety. Also, this is the only restaurant I've been to where the tofu soup is on the house. We sampled most of the meat, including Kalbi, bulgogi, chicken and pork. The meat was marinated perfectly and tasted delicious, very similar to some of the meals I have had in the LA k-town. \nThey have a parking spot for tour buses right outside the restaurant. During the middle of our meal, half the customers in the restaurant started leaving. We were a little confused until we realized they were all from the same Korean tour group. \nThe bill was around $160 for a group of six people. We left the restaurant with our stomach full, our clothes and hair smelling like Korean BBQ, and some bones for my dogs to chew on.

Prices are a bit high, but that's usually the case with most Korean restaurants. Meals start with plenty of banchan which you can refill. Tofu stew is provided too. However, if you're in a group, it usually isn't enough for everyone to get more than a few spoonfuls. When I have eaten here alone, they give you your own individual bowl which is a lot better.\n\nI almost always get the kalbi. Most pieces are pretty good, but I usually have trouble with the single bone piece they include since the meat is difficult to chew. I've also tried the chicken once, which was really good, but it takes far too long to cook so I would rather just stick to other items. Stone pot bibimbap was really good here too.\n\nThey usually include enough miniature (bite-size) pancakes on the house for everyone near the end of the meal. I wasn't a big fan of these pancakes like I usually am at other Korean restaurants though, to be honest.\n\nAnother thing - parking is horrible around here, so you may have to walk a few blocks.\n\nOverall, a pretty good place to get Korean food for lunch.

The smell of Korean BBQ was obvious even a block away! \n\nI like how the restaurant gives you the option of BBQ-ing your own meat or getting it served to you already cooked. Since it was my friend's first time BBQing his own meat, we decided to choose that method. However, because it is so time consuming, I probably wouldn't do it again next time. I mean, there is something to be said about having someone else cook your meat for you, no? \n\nIf you want to BBQ your own meat, there is a 2-plate minimum for each table. It was a bit too much food for the both of us, to be honest. We ordered the Kalbi and the Bulgogi (spicy). The Kalbi was really good - I would definitely order that again. The spicy bulgogi was ok... I've had better. It was a bit too spicy for me - perhaps next time I'll order the regular bulgogi. The tofu soup was watery and not too flavorful - my favorite is still the spicy tofu soup at Sahn Maru in Oakland. \n\nService was ok.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-08", "description": "I came here with a coworker after work last week. We arrived around 5:40 and were told we'd have to wait about 30 minutes for a table. My coworker had been here before and said it was worth the wait, so we sat down and made ourselves comfortable, reading the menu as we waited. I noticed there were several empty tables that looked like they were set for people to eat at, but nobody was there. Then, almost suddenly, a tour bus pulled in and about 50 Korean passengers piled out and marched into the restaurant. They sat down at these tables and began eating furiously. In about 15 more minutes, a second bus pulled in, and more people came flooding into the restaurant. The first group was done eating in about half an hour. I'd say that there were about 4 or 5 tour busses that dropped off passengers and picked them up during the time we waited for a table! We ended up waiting about 45 minutes for our table, but my coworker assured me it would be worth it.\n\nWe made our way to our table through the last of the Korean tour bus groups and sat down. We'd already been looking at the menu and were now REALLY hungry, since we'd waited for a long time. We had agreed to purposely order more than we knew we could eat, just so we could have more types of food. We ended up ordering the dol sot bi bim bap, kimchi pancake, seafood pancake, and kalbi.\n\nThe bi bim bap was SO GOOD. The rice was nice and crispy at the bottom and there was a really good ratio of vegetables/meat to the rice. In fact, we each only ate a little bit of it (since we ordered so much other food), and, by the time we were done eating about two hours later, the pot was still hot and everything was just as good!\n\nBoth the kimchi pancake and seafood pancake were absolutely scrumptious. I'm personally more a fan of the seafood pancake and didn't like the kimchi one quite as much, but both were delicious.\n\nNow, the kalbi, oh man - this is not just the regular thinly sliced beef-rib-meat. It had the whole bone (I think it was actually the cut of meat that wraps around the bone at Korean barbecue places...not sure what it's called). They cooked it for us since we only ordered one meat, but the plate that came out was piled high with meat and the bones were included! This may have been my favorite part of the meal!\n\nLet me just say that this place was certainly more than worth the wait. Sure, we ended up spending quite a bit of money, but this meal ended up lasting us at least 3-4 more meals! (I love to have leftovers, so that's always a good thing for me.)

This place is still pretty good though.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nWe made a reservation for sat night at 7:45. I get there at 7:30 and tell him we are here. He says it'll be an extra 20 minute wait. I'm thinking, really?? I told him we had reservations and he said he can't do anything. Anyways, we get seated 30 minutes after our reservations.  \n\nThe waiter, bald head guy, made a snippy remark to my younger cousin about paying for a drink. That def. did not start the meal off on the right foot. But after I ordered a very simple dish called Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap (hot stone pot bi bim bap), I coudn't put my finger on WHY it wasn't tasting right. I added more chan geerum (sesame oil) and more gochujang (hot paste) and still it wasn't right. After about 20 minutes I figured it was the place did NOT add any beef AND no sheegum chee (cooked spinach in sesame oil and salt).  I'm like, how the heck do you not have sheegum chee?!?! I could go back there and make it. The texture and the taste completes bibim bap and I've never had Bi Bim Bap without sheegum chee EVER or ANYWHERE.\n\nHonestly, I'm sick of korean places in the bay area. Way overpriced and par food at best. Def. never going to Wooden BBQ on Geary and will probably not frequent here as much anymore.

The short ribs were tender and quite yummy. The dumpling was okay as well.  However, the spicy pork was too soft as if it was not BBQ because I can still taste the marination and the tofu soup was bland. We had reservation but still had to wait a bit due to everyone from the Korean tour bus. Overall, the food was average. The only thing nice was the sweet rice drink at the end.

My favorites are probably the bulgogi and kalbi dish. The seafood bimbibab is pretty decent as well! They also have tables with grills if you prefer to cook your meat yourself. It is pretty pricey, but it is San Francisco.  They start you off with 6-7 side dishes! I was really sad they do not have fish cakes or seaweed. They also give you a free tofu soup on the house! Service, however, was terrible. My party and I had a hard time deciding what to get and the waitress came to our table every 5 minutes to ask if we were ready and she sounded quite impatient. But their food is good so I can care less. What was ridiculous was- they did not give us our change after we paid and took it. We sat there waiting for 20 minutes and saw no sign of the workers returning our tab so we had to go ask them for it. Did they really think we are giving 30% tip for such horrible services? If you're looking for great and attentive service, skip this place. If you don't really care much about service and only want good Korean food then this is your place to go. Definitely make sure you get your change back though!", "author": "Shanna C."}

I mean it is convenient; we walked there from their house so parking was mitigated. We were lucky to get seating for 8 right before the next busload of tourists came in. Technically, since we've been out of the city for so long, that makes us tourist too I guess. Alot of the places that we used to remember in the Richmond are gone. This place has been here for awhile but I never came here until now. \n\nMy bro-in-law ordered a bunch of stuff and we ate community style so I don't know exactly what everything was; it's not like I was very familiar with Korean cuisine to begin with, I usually defer to someone else to order anyway. I do like Kalbi ribs though and I've had some pretty good stuff in the past. So I was pretty disappointed with the paltry serving that came out... not only was there not enough to go around (we ordered two of everything..) the meat was chewy and so tough that you would have to spit it out to keep from choking, you couldn't chew through it. Everything else was kind of ordinary and uninspiring... I don't even remember anything really noteworthy. \n\nThe service was quick, but emotionless, even rude.... they practically threw all the dishes down at us... Such a dine and dash mentality...

With that said, Han Il Kwan is truly a hidden gem in the residential part of Richmond district.\n\nI came here yesterday with my dad and grandma, and we ordered the lunch specials beef bulgogi, bibimbap, and japchae. Overall food quality and quantity were amazing! Loved the banchan too, especially the radish, tofu, and kimchi! They give ~8 dishes, and they're not stingy with the portions either. Bulgogi was very tender, juicy, and flavorful. It first appears dry and boring, but most of the juices are all underneath the meat, at the bottom of the plate. I always love the presentation of bibimbap, and it came in a huge, sizzling stone pot with lots of fresh vegetables and a container of gochujang (Korean red pepper paste). Japchae was oily but had a heaping load of beef and vegetables (shredded carrot, onion, scallion, shiitake mushroom, and that common mushroom). Complimentary tofu soup had a little spiciness and lots of chunks of tofu, a few chunks of meat, and some scallions. And to top this feast off, your not-so-typical dessert, sikhye, a sweet rice water drink. I just wish they served more and in a larger cup!\n\nThe overall service was very friendly, but slow in the beginning. Clean little restaurant with cute outer and interior decor. Will definitely be back, especially for the weekday lunch specials! (Served Monday through Friday, until 4PM, except on major holidays, ie: New Years, Christmas, Thanksgiving.)

We get in and see two groups ahead of us, yet the restaurant had all these empty tables that needed to be cleared.  That gave me a bad first impression (why not clean the tables and let the people sit).  No one came up to us to ask how many in our party or anything.  So I started getting skeptical.  Within 5 minutes of getting to the restaurant, a string of korean people come in... non-stop.  A korean tour bus had just come.  So then it made sense, all the workers were busy setting up the table for this large group.  Once the group got seated in the back room, I see all these workers cleaning tables and that's when someone came to greet us.  Yes, not the most friendly of greetings, but cordial and fine.  \n\nThe food was good (but my mom's is better).  I think the kimchi at 90% of korean restaurants suck, this one was good/pretty good.  We ordered (the prices are what I think it was, don't quote me):\n\ngalbi chim (beef rib stew, sort of) ~$24: large potatoes, large carrots, good sauce, tender. very yum.  You can't really go wrong with galbi chim, but this one was like home cooking, not typical restaurant style\n\nDaenjangjigae (bean paste stew) ~$11: it was good.  tofu, jalapenos, not too strong smelling (I wanted my non-korean friend to try it)\n\nDukbokki (spicy rice cake) $~12 : this was really good.  It's not as spicy as most places (which is good and bad).  But still had enough heat at the end.  b/c it wasn't as spicy, you could taste more flavors. I brought some home to my mom, and she said it was pretty good dukbokki.\n\nKimchi jun (kimchi pancake) ~$14: I really liked this. It is pretty thick, but fully cooked.  Sometimes when juns are thick, they are not fully cooked all the way through and I hate that.  This was good stuff.  \n\nI thought the service was fine, but we weren't demanding diners (and we didn't do BBQ.  I was catching up with an old friend and didn't want to waste time cooking my own food).  I think some of the waiters don't speak english well, so that may be why people say the servers aren't so friendly.  I asked a random server what kind of soju they had.  He looked around the room (i think looking for the other english speaking waiter), and said in a terse manner \"only have one.\"  So I realized he doesn't speak english well, so I respond back in korea \"could we have one bottle please.\"  Then he loosened up and said apologized that they didn't have options (all in korean).    Yes, service was a little slow, but we didn't really take notice b/c we were catching up (and the banchan/side dishes came out fast so we had something to munch on.", "author": "Minah L."}

Finally, the man in the blue sweater came by and said \"You can't wave your hands like this, it\u00a0is\u00a0rude and what do you want?\" We told him we were sorry, and we just want some water and he left.

When my husband was eating the pancake, he found a rubber band inside of it. The rubber band was fried right inside the pancake and he almost ingested!  How disgusting is that? To have a rubber band show up in your food is intolerable. Someone should call the health department and report this place!  When I called them to let them know about it, the woman on the phone just said, \"oh I'm sorry.\"  No offer of a refund. When I asked for a refund , she told me to come right away and bring all the food back with me!  Well, most of the food was already eaten. The rubber band wasn't discovered until the meal was almost over. So no, why should I be inconvenienced to drive all the way back to this restaurant at 7:15PM in order to get a refund? I offered to email/text a pic of the rubber band pancake, but the woman on the phone said she doesn't want a picture of it. So I'm posting the picture on Yelp.  Do not eat here. I never will again.

The restaurant provides either tofu soup or steamed egg with your meal (I'd suggest the tofo soup although they sometimes throw in the steamed egg anyway).\n\nThe service wasn't great.  It's not that they were rude, but they didn't have enough staff on hand.

It was regular Korean food and we had some nice memories so I came back on a recent Sunday for lunch with just one friend.  \n\nWarning:\n- They have two kinds of tables.

You need to know this fact before going in or you might be treated like a tard for not knowing...like I was.\n- As far as I could tell from the menu...the meat dishes are what you'll cook and they are at least $20 each.  So lunch at the cooking tables will cost you at least $40.\n\nI suggest only sitting at the cooking tables if you're a group of 3-4 so you can do two meats and some other thing.

There was no saltiness, sweetness, soy flavor, spices, nothing.  The beef was very plain.  It tasted like what a school kid in home economics class would cook.  We added soy sauce to the beef and it only added saltiness.  The beef remained tasteless.  We left half the beef on the plate.\n\nThe rib soup was like plain water.  The good Korean restaurants I liked had flavorful soup apparently made from hours of simmering the beef and bones.  This restaurant's soup was flavorless, like it was hastily slapped together after I ordered it.

I can't really handle spicy but this was good.\ntofu soup- pretty good\n2 bim bam bop- best I have had but I am not a huge Korean expert \nkorean beef- it was extremely chewy! take your time eating this or you'll choke!\nseafood pancake- not bad if u dip it in the soy sauce they provide. i think it would be disgusting if you eat it when its cold\nbbq chicken- absolutely nothing special about this at all. just regular bbq chicken\n\nthey have a lot of side dishes to offer and tasty! They provide lettuce for you make your own wraps with the meat and the side dishes. YUM!\n\nComplementary egg thing at the beginning yum. Complementary water egg. Goes well with the soy sauce. You get a bowl of rice for every item you order without rice in it. \n\nWe didn't bbq our own meat but it was cool. I don't want my hair to smell.\n\nOne bathroom for women and one bathroom for men. One stall for the female while other ladies can wash their hands and check themselves out in the mirror while waiting. The stall is cramped and don't have hangers. \n\nOverall best Korean experience I have had. BUT I have only been to 3 other \"authentic\" Korean places.", "author": "Sarah C."}

They unload about 40-50 people into the restaurant at a time. Once they've finished, the next bus pulls up and they switch out. Pretty efficient. They must make a lot of money. But you know what?

But just nicely answer our  question, giving everybody how long to wait is fine. \n\nEven more, one thing makes me mad is that they say the name on the list is not correct, everybody waiting in the store at the time seems arrive same time.. Ok, then we say WHAT!!!! By the time, we have waited for 45+mins, is 6:43 something.... Even though there are people say we are the first, they still give the table to someone who personally say they have reserves.. (Apparently they have 8 people and we have 3.. You know what is going on..) \n\nThe end is that, we leave... This is just one time waiting, next time, need to wait, we will leave...\n\nI have been there for more than 10 times... Not one time make me satisfied... Always like waiting, not only for table, also for food, especially  services... You want some water, need to wait, guys... \n\nSad, really disappointed.. \nJust one word... There are still some good korean restaurant, if need to wait, don't go this one, nothing special...", "author": "Q C."}

I usually pay around $20 during dinner, which is a little high for me, but the quality of their food and service make it well worth the price. \n\nFirst, the banchan. I love how they rotate the banchan...you never know what your going to get. And I can never get over how there's so many choices and how we can get as many servings as we like. This time around my favorites were the fish cake (always a favorite) and the chilled cucumbers. The fish cake here is a little spicy, but it's not overwhelming at all. The cucumbers were nice to eat whenever I needed a break from our some of our spicy entrees.\n\nDuring my last trip, my friends and I shared the rice cakes in red sauce, an order of kalbi, and # 30. Can't remember the name right now, but it was these different types of seafood with rice and an egg on top...kind of like bibimbap but without the vegetables. The latter was my favorite dish of the night. It's great for seafood lovers, and while it was spicy, I still could taste all the other flavors. Plus the crunchy rice at the bottom of the bowl is always a plus! Kalbi was standard- the meat was a little too chewy at times, but I liked how the marinade wasn't too sweet. Spicy rice cakes were some of the hottest I've ever had, but I managed to endure and really enjoyed them. The rice cakes were perfectly cooked.\n\nService here is really nice and helpful, and the restaurant is pretty spacious so I never feel crammed in. Parking can be hard to come by in this neighborhood, but don't let that hinder you from eating here. I still haven't had lunch here, but their lunch specials seem like a really great deal! Definitely will stop by here for lunch next time!", "author": "Amanda K."}

The dishes are just so-so.  The ba-chans (little plates) that everyone is raving about are no better than any typical Korean restaurants.  Seriously.\n\nWe made reservations for 7pm fo 11 people and didn't get seated until maybe 7:30 because some tour group was late coming from Vancouver so we had to wait until they finish.  The owner did comp us free 1st round of drinks, including beer.  When we finally got seated, you would think that because of the wait, they would tend on our table immediately. But nope - as most people say, if you get seated inside those \"private\" rooms, be prepared to wait.  We waited and tried to wave someone down.  We even walked outside of the room to get the waiter's attention. He acknowledged us and said he'll be coming, but nope. Another 10 mins passed.  We were all starving.  It's about 8pm already - 1hr after our initial 7pm reservation.  We finally ate around 8:15.  It's ridiculous.\n\nThe food, once again, was mediocre.  We ordered the Dinner B special for $145, and I don't think it's worth it at all.  We ordered a chop-jae and a seafood pancake on the side.  Do not order the seafood pancake.  It sucks.  \n\nI would not come back to this place again.  I would rather go to Shin Toe Bu Yi on Taraval.\n\nReview #129", "author": "Jannie Q."}

Before this place I found Korean food to be quite dull, but this place easily changed my mind. The workers are always so kind and will gladly give you a little more kimchi if you ask. I never do the grilling because the times I go here it's for small celebrations. Don't get scared of the prices though. The dishes, plus free kimchi, plus the rice tea, will definitely give you food coma. Practically everything I've tried here is well-seasoned and I always fall in love with Korean food more and more when I order different things on their menu.\n\nNow lemme also say that I spent one month in South Korea last summer, yknow taking in the sights and eating the variety of food and stocking up on some kpop merch. I compared this place to the food I ate in South Korea. Equally delicious (but Han Il Kwan does not have a certain noodle dish I loved very much in Korea). And what surprised me was that my friend (who went to Korea with me) and I compared the Kalbi from Han Il Kwan to the Kalbi we had in Korea. We both agreed that Han Il Kwan's kalbi was much more flavorful and more tender. So trying this place's kalbi is A MUST!\n For you spicy lovers, order their marinated pork. I'm a huge lover of spicy foods and their marinated pork has become my favorite dish here. But if you're feeling particularly lazy, get the Bi Bim Bop. Most of their food is delicious.\n\nNote: Certain tourist seasons, this place is PACKED! Beware of Han Il Kwan being too crowded.

I got my answer when a Korean tour bus pulled up and unloaded the passengers into the restaurant.

The meat was very tasty and not chewy like some other places.  The dumplings were good, but they would have been better if they were a bit more crispy on the outside.  The seafood pancake was meh.

Luckily this lady couldn't fit her large suv in this tight parallel parking spot and we got a spot in less than 5 minutes. When we went into the restaurant, this Korean lady patron told us \"you are very very lucky it is hard to find a spot here\". Her husband didn't get into the restaurant until 10-15 minutes later (who knows how long she came before us) \n\n2) wear your dingiest clothes, no clothes that need dry cleaning, not your favorite sweater. after you eat here, you will smell and it is not an aphrodisiac. \n\nThat said, the restaurant is an all around Korean restaurant serving many noodle, rice, soup dishes but also table side kbq meat grilling for those who want that experience. \n\nEverything on the menu looked really good.

Keep in mind, not only did I say kimchi jeon (kimchi pancake) in Korean, I made sure to repeat it in english and point at the menu, because who enjoys getting their orders misunderstood?  (She heard kimchi jeongol, how she managed to hear an extra syllable is beyond me). The people I was with can all confirm that they heard me order it in both Korean and English. My mistake that she didn't follow my finger to the menu, or pay attention long enough to hear me repeat the item in English. To top it off, when another one of the waitresses was placing the ban chan (side dishes) on the table, one of the guests I was with was moving things down in anticipation of the many items we ordered and the waitress snaps at her, asking her not to touch them because she was placing them specifically for color. Excuse me, but none of us really care if you create a rainbow of side dishes on our table; it wasn't our first time at a Korean restaurant and we all have our preferences for which dishes we like to eat, and we're only trying to be considerate when they came with the main courses and would eventually need to move the side dishes to make room anyway. I swore never to return to their restaurant, but today I was asked to place a reservation for 8 people here to which a woman who kept cutting me off mid sentence to chit chat with another woman in the background informed me they didn't have tables for 8 people. I've been here enough times to know they can accommodate large parties. I don't know what happened over the years for all the ladies who work here to become so bitter, nasty, and especially rude. I know my review won't keep people from coming here, and this isn't to say ALL the ladies are rude, but a few of them are very snappy and short tempered and if they hated interacting with people, God knows why they became waitresses. Good luck for those who still wish to dine here, I know I won't.", "author": "Eunice K."}

So fam din din was at Han Il Kwan.  I called in for reservation a week ahead of time.  Some of the relatives arrived there early, and servers said we didn't have a reservation.  After double-checking the calendar, there was my name, but it was not transferred to the waiting list.  O well, I wasn't too worried.  However, some of my relatives are way more temperamental, particularly since they said it would be 45 min. (prior to finding out we had a reservation).  They then changed it to 15-20, but let the next available table go to someone else.  So, after assertive negotiation (from relative), we got a table.  Again, I wasn't too upset b/c the server came by and apologized and offered 30% off our entire order!  \n\nWe ordered Dinner A  even though we had 7 people, it says \"up to 6 people...\" Server said it was plenty of food.  We added another plate of kalbi at the end.  Dinner A included Jap chae, boiled egg, tofu soup, spicy squid, tempura zucchini, oysters, shrimp, pancake, and for meat we chose kalbi and spicy pork.  All were enjoyable.  The best dishes were the jap chae (a lot of flavor), kalbi, and boiled egg (soft and fluffy).  We ended up saving $46 when receiving the bill...not bad for waiting (I must say).

With a pleasant smile, our waiter Tina took our order.  \n\nA few minutes latter, a vibrant fleet of side dishes call \"ban chan\" excites the appetite.  Notable ban chans include pillowy mung bean cake, steamed egg custard, and kimchi - with a combination of sweet and spicy tones.  \n\nIn Korea, there are many varieties of kimchi and each taste is unique to its region.  Because of it proximity to the ocean, the kimchi in the northwest of Korea is seasoned with fish and oyster.  While low in calories but high in dietary fiber, one serving of kimchi can provide a high amount of Vitamin C and Carotene.  \n\nOther healthy ingredients often used in kimchi recipes include chili and garlic. Before the times of refrigeration, many types of kimchi were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground using large kitchen pots.\n\nArriving in a small stone pot, the hot tofu ($8.95) features a dark red soup simmering with silky tofu.  The spicy flavors from the chilli stimulated my appetite further more.  \n\nTopped with a golden sunny side egg, the dol sop beem bi beem bap ($11.95) served in a large clay pot displayed multiple flavors.  With a few squeeze of their house sweet chilli sauce, the medley of vegetables combined with the creminess from the eggs and savory bbq beef pieces created a good comfort food dish.  The highlights were the nutty flavors from over cooked rice sizzling from the heated clay pot.  \n\nRiding along the flavor train, Jap Cha (saut\u00e9ed vegetables with beef and vermicelli-$11.95) is a great peppery noodle dish that compliments the bowl of rice.  \n\nSkip the cold noodle served with beef and raddish ($10.95).  The addition of mustard and chili paste did not rescue the cold soup base from its lack of character and flavor.  Quickly, I reached for cubes of raddish marinated in chilli sauce to thrill my palate.  \n\nKorean food is unique from other Asian cuisines in that it gives the diner control in terms of flavor, temperature and texture instantly.  If a dinner's palate has been over infused with spicy flavors, a quick nibble from cooling cucumbers or sprout amongst the pan chan army does the trick.      \n\nFor a table of four, the total was $60 including tips.", "author": "Rayfil W."}

The food here is definitely pretty good!\n\nThe first experience was pretty amazing. The food was great, if not a bit pricey, but I came with one other person and they were extremely generous! Lots of stuff on the house: steamed egg, chap chae... I think there were at least 4-5 things that we didn't order that came for free (not counting the ban-chan of course). \n\nThe second time I went there with two other people. Portions were pretty good (not the best I've had, especially for what they give you), but it was still good fun. This time we used the special cooking table for the BBQ meats, which was a blast with a good group of people. Service was considerably less satisfactory this time around... our ban-chan was never refilled, tea/water never replenished... our group was pretty much ignored the whole time we were there, despite having ordered quite a bit of food... which was very disappointing. It was a bit busy though, so I figured they just didn't have enough help...\n\nThe third time is what puts me on the fence about this place. We had reservations for a table (for 5 people), but when we got there, it still took them 15-20 minutes to seat us. It seemed as if they had forgotten about us for a bit, and we were left waiting around. Even after we were seated, ordering was difficult (took forever to get a waiter's attention). We ordered quite a bit of food this time around (oddly enough, when we tried to order just the fried tofu... the waiter gave us a funny look and told us it was not a good dish... so we avoided that one):\n\n1. Chap Chae - pretty tasty; one of my favorite dishes to get here\n2. Tofu Soup - decent... probably wouldn't order again\n3. Mackerel - first time I've had it, very crispy and flavorful\n4. Seafood Pancake - average, have had better, it was a bit thick... and there were very little ingredients\n5. Dak Gul - definitely would order again, marinated perfectly, juicy and oh so tasty :)\n\nThere were 9 ban-chan dishes (I think the most I've ever had at a Korean place): fishcake, cucumber (yummy), kimchi, eggplant, beef something (pretty good), beansprouts, the gelatin stuff, radish, and pickled something. The ban-chan was definitely awesome... the service was not... The entire time we were there, we didn't get a single refill of tea/water, getting any service whatsoever was difficult, even when it was just to get the check! To top it off, the place was maybe only half full at the time...\n\nSo in conclusion... pretty great food (some of the best Korean I've had, ever)... but if you're looking for service... look waaaaaaaaay elsewhere :/", "author": "Denise C."}

(I will explain towards the end....)\n\nSecond, this restaurant is expensive $$$ including myself, I went with a party of 5. I understood that we had to order two dishes to be seated at the table with the grill. When we walked in, the waiter guy just sat us at the regular table without asking us where we wanted to be seated. To be in the service industry, hun, you have to have decent english abilities (or whatever the dominant language is in.) We constant had to repeat what we were saying twice, and when the waiter spoke back he had to repeat twice as well because we could not understand his english.\nOkay back to the point of their EXPENSIVENESS, so we ordered two of the grilling ourselves dishes which were ~$20 each. The waiter tells us that we have to order one dish per person at least. So we order three lunch specials which were ~$10 each. \n\nThirdly, the food was OKAY. The dishes we cooked ourselves were good but the other lunch specials were dry. \n\nSo this is where the real shit happened. We get the bill and the bolded price is with an 18% tip already calculated into the tab. The ACTUAL TOTAL was  ~$16 per person (tip not included) in our group of 5. We flag him down and waited for him to bring us back our change, so then we'll give the tip. The waiter never came back. We saw him around and we were tired of waiting (we were also waiting for the rice drink at the end of the meal, which never came) so we left the tip on the table. Admittedly, our tip was not much. We left a 5% tip... \n\nAs we were walking down the block, the waiter runs after us and gives us back our tip and says \"IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD THE FOOD NEXT TIME, JUST GET TAKE-OUT\" and something about a not big enough tip....\n\nOf course I'm defensive. It's not like we skipped out on the bill and a tip is something we think of their service. \n\nSo bottom line, do NOT come here if you don't plan to spend some BIG DOLLARS on MEDIOCRE FOOD.

Since this place has a two plate minimum for bbq, we decided to order the Kalbi and Marinated Spicy Pork which came out to be almost $50. \n\nThe chubby waitress with short hair took our order and gave us extreme attitude because we only wanted to order two entrees for four people. I asked her if there was a minimum to order at the restaurant and she said \"no, but you have four people\". First off, we were not really hungry and just wanted a snack so why would we order more if we know we can't finish everything, not to mention the side dishes. So she decided to yell at me and gave me attitude by asking how much rice I wanted. I said we don't need much and before I finished, she said you get two rice bowls only and walked away. She didn't even ask us if we wanted the complimentary soup or steamed egg but whatever. Then, after our food was served, I saw the same waitress glare at our table and start gossiping to her coworker while pointing fingers at me. I stared back at them and she looked away. \n\nOur bbq grill was also defected. Flames flared up on our grill at random times and it came up to the level of our faces. When we told the waiter about the issue, he claimed that the fire went off because we put \"too much meat on top\" (there was only six small pieces of meat). He came back a second time to check on the grill and realized the flame was still off with two pieces of meat. He decided to just light up the grill and walked away and never came back. Our flame never came back on and they didn't bother to change our burnt bbq top. Next, I noticed the same chubby waitress was gossiping about us again but this time with a female coworker. They were both blatantly staring at us. When we called that female coworker over, she straight up threw the \"no\" hand signal at us and made a #2 hand signal (stereotype Chinese sign) to her other coworker while laughing. All we wanted was the check too. \n\nThis is by far the WORST KOREAN PLACE EVER!!! I love trying new places and this is definitely a place I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND. TRUST ME, I eat out a lot and will definitely spread the word about my negative experience here. If you want good Korean food, I promise MY TOFU HOUSE IS 10X BETTER THAN THIS PLACE!!! MY TOFU HOUSE HAS WAY BETTER SERVICE, DELICOUS MEAT (not plain like Han II Kwan), AND QUALITY FOOD! For self-serve BBQ, go to BROTHERS ON GEARY OR JP for all you can eat. This place is NOT WORTH THE MONEY! ZERO STARS IF IT WAS POSSIBLE ON YELP! Also, before I forget, the Korean workers were truly discriminating against other races, not only because of the RACIST hand sign, but because they ONLY SERVED KOREANS with immediate service and ignored everyone else.", "author": "Monica C."}

We went for a late lunch so the restaurant was nearly empty.  That being said, parking was still absolutely beyond frustration!!!  But the wonderful meal that awaited us soon made us forget fifteen minutes of circling the local neighborhood beforehand.\n\nHan Il Kwan was impeccably clean and service was excellent as one would expect with only two groups of diners.  We were amazed at the large spread of banchan arrayed before us - about ten dishes, and an excellent soup.  We shared bulgogi and chap chae and a mixed seafood dish that was absolutely spectacular with calamari, mussels, shrimp, scallops and other tidbits.  Outstanding!!", "author": "Carmen H."}

We parked about two blocks away and it wasn't even busy here.\n\nThe biggest turnoff was that we we had to wait 15 minutes for a table when the place was only half full. It was probably because all the smaller tables were full, but we didn't even get offered a seat at the larger tables. I guess it's reserved for large groups but still, it's just not right to make us wait when there's about 8 open larger tables available. \n\nI don't know if someone called out sick or what, but they just had one guy doing all the front end work, so we had to wait even longer for menus and service. \n\nSummary: Even though it was filling and tasted good, I will probably not go back. Hard to find parking and unnecessarily making us wait was a turn off. Add in insufficient staffing and I'm no longer interested.", "author": "Johnny D."}

This place is NOT a tofu house -- I ordered what she said was tofu soup with vegetables and meat, the bibambap and bf had the seafood udon noodle soup.\n\nFirst of all, we took a cab from SoMa for this!! It was like $15 to get here since we didn't feel like driving because we knew parking was a pain. When we got there, we were worried about our way back -- no cab in sight. This little restaurant was tucked away in a neighborhood area.\n\nThe cute thing was, there was a Korean Tour Bus in front of it -- looks like this place was legit!! So we got a nice booth, equipped with a grill in the middle and a fan above to suck of all the smoke -- too bad we were not going to grill.\n\nOne of the great things about this place is all the freebies/side dishes that you get!! They initially gave us a little pancake with a vinegar sauce. I liked it a lot! Then out came out the side dishes: kimchi, cucumbers with sesame seeds, pickled daikon, picked sliced radish, seaweed, little anchovies, bean sprouts and this tapioca square thingie. Quite honestly, I've tried better side dishes than this place.\n\nThen our food came out. The bibambap was good, probably my favorite one. A nice hot clay pot of yummy gooeyness when mixed with their spicy sauce -- yummy!! But, the tofu soup had no flavor, barely any meat and was very thin. Not my favorite. My bf had the seafood udon noodle soup which came with this egg soup too. They put a lot of squid in the udon soup!! Just alright tasting food for above average prices. Not good.\n\nThe service was quick and efficient but they didn't come over to ask us if the food was okay. Maybe there was a language barrier? At the end, when she gave us the check, she gave us these little glasses of some sort of rice dessert. I was not particularly fond of it but my bf loved it. Took them both like shots of alcohol!!\n\nI think this place is probably best for their grilling entrees, not tofu soups (or lackthereof). I'll probably be back to try it...\n\nPS.

Really good Korean food, lots of panchan (even 2 special panchan on the house), friendly service, and nice atmosphere inside.\n\nThe dolsot bi bim bap (in hot stone pot) was some of the best we've had. It came with a generous portion and the stone pot was so hot that the rice was still sizzling, creating an awesome rice crust for us to enjoy. Other places don't serve dolsot bbm with as hot of a pot and there isn't as much of a crust. And the red hot sauce I added was so good as I love a spicy Korean sauce.  The other dish we ordered - a tofu and veggie one - was also perfectly hot and spicy. \n\nWe got all the panchan mentioned by others (and shown in the picture) as well as two extra hot side dishes that they gave us totally complimentary on the house - one was a small plate with two yummy Korean egg pancake-like things with ingredients mixed in it and the other was a mini-pot of tasty and fluffy steamed egg. That was super cool and definitely earned them some brownie points.\n\nWhat was also impressive is their service efficiency. When we first approached this place, we were so worried about the wait given the 2 huge tour buses that stopped right in front and unloaded at least 90 people into the restaurant right as we were walking down the block toward the restaurant. I thought we would have to wait at least an hour with the madhouse of people. But I guess they handle large tour groups all the time and these 90 people sat down, were served their set menu, ate, were done, and out the door in about 45 minutes. So impressive. And we still received decent service at the same time. \n\nOnly minor thing I didn't like was that you couldn't just order 1 portion of bulgogi (korean marinated grilled beef) - you had to order at minimum the portion for 2 for something like $40 that you bbq at your table. Also parking sucks since this is more of a residential neighborhood - we had to circle around 6 times around the surrounding blocks to find a spot.\n\nBottom line: Really good Korean with efficient service and good side dishes (and extra complimentary ones if you've been nice).

While other places on Yelp said they closed at 9:30 or not open on Sundays, a phone call to this place confirmed that it closed at 10 on Sundays. Although it was several miles away through local traffic along winding and roller coaster-like roads, I decided to depend on the 4 stars average (which this restaurant brags about via sign near the exit!) produced by Yelp's real people.\n\nHan Il Kwan was on the corner of Balboa and 19th almost camouflaged among residential houses (which all look the same in San Francisco) were it not for the shining beacon that was the sign for the restaurant. Parking was difficult to find that late, but I did not have to walk more than a block.\n\nGood thing it opens that late because there were two other groups eating with us, also seated along the window for the world to see how great the place was. The servers seemed quite attentive: I made eye contact with one, and she took our order. They regularly came by to check on us, and I was able to get more banchan and napkins without having to ask. They also seemed well versed in both Korean and English.\n\nThe banchan came in three waves (without counting the steamed egg \"on the house\"). Good Lord, I should not have ordered three items for two people. But I felt like I might as well be baller after driving a grueling 7 miles in the city, damn. Banchan was delicious, food was delicious, and even the egg was delicious (I usually do not like egg). By the way I ordered the \"thick beef soup\" (sullung tang), \"pan fried pollack\" and \"fried meat dumplings.\" I kept the receipt in my pocket for 3 days solely to report to the Yelp community. Please make me an elite one day. \n\nOne thing I would noted was the relatively steep price on certain items. Others were decently priced for the area. The exit also smelled like newspaper drenched in urine.\n\nI would like to return here for the lunch special, but I forget if it is available during weekends. I would not call myself a fan, but I am giving it 4 stars for its excellent food and especially excellent service (these are the people who actually deserve tips).\n\nGood night diary,\nBrian\n\nUpdate: I can consider myself a fan or at least a supporter because I find often myself referring to this place when I talk about Korean food.", "author": "Brian H."}

Their \"four\" rooms are all divided by your old school accordion room dividers and can open up to seat larger parties such as 20 or more.  \n\nThis is by far one of the better Korean restaurants in SF AND very comparable to the Korean food in K-town in LA.

OMG the Kimichi Pancake was the BEST I've ever had.  It was so flavorful and you could actually taste the Kimchi.  Most places I've had it always made it too bland and you couldn't really taste the Kimchi.  The Short Ribs were marinated just right and the flavor really came through after being barbecued.  The Bi Bi Pap is pretty much like your typical Bi Bi Pap...hot. LOL.  Make sure you eat this slowly as the dish is kept warm by the hot stone pot it is served in.  The best part of the meal is the FREE little appetizers they give you to go with your meal.  They're mostly cold vegetable dishes to help balance the meat and hot dishes you're about eat. Also as a freebie, they give you Spicy Soft Tofu Soup, which tasted AMAZING.  There was an extra kick that is left in your mouth after slurping this magnificent soup. Then finally for dessert, they give you a malted sweet rice drink that was DE-LISH. I kept asking for more =D. \n\nThis is my new go to Korean place when I'm in the mood for Korean.

Han Il Kwan has great ventilation, so none of those things were really necessary. (but we did them anyway)\n\nAs for the food, if you have never had Korean in SoCal, it's pretty good. I'd say about as good as some of the better places in NYC or Queens. Of the 5 meats we ordered (seasoned and unseasoned Kalbi , Bulgogi, Spicy Pork, Pork Belly), I'd say the meat and marinade quality were average, but they are definitely not stingy with quantity. Don't expect much from the service, you'll be cutting and grilling all your own meat, but thats all part of the fun right? While their Soondooboo Jigae was totally bland and watery, the banchan was pretty good and they had a decent number (8 or so). However, if you are expecting SoCal level Korean, just stay home, there is no point.\n\nOne thing though, this place is in a totally sleepy residential part of town.

That was fine (even though the restaurant was half empty) but his attitude was not. My cousin asked politely if we could be seated a bit sooner as we had 3 older family members with us but he curtly said no and walked away.

After some back and forth and him telling me to \"calm down\" and rolling his eyes at my cousin, we finally left and found a place nearby that was able to seat is right away.

They must do a lot of business with several Korean tour groups.\n\nAnyway, this place is a bit of fresh air for not having much to choose from in terms of decent Korean food in the city.  Oddly enough, I discovered this place when I was applying for my current residence because my property management office is located right next door.   The restaurant is  located in a mostly residential neighborhood so it is a bit strange to see this place here.  Parking is possible (it being away from downtown and other high-traffic areas) but Balboa St./Inner Richmond can be challenging some times.\n\nFood- This is four-star worthy for sure for SF.  I've been here many times and have had pretty much the staple dishes. They don't specialize in anything particular, but if you stick to the popular dishes (grills/barbeque,  chigaes), you're good. I did order galbi-chim once and was disappointed that the beef didn't fall off the bone (it tasted like they boiled the beef and then put it in the stew instead of having it slow-cooked).

My craving for Korean BBQ is somewhat rare and typically satisfied by a trip to Brothers on Geary.   \n\nThe timing was right on Friday night when MCM and I were sipping homemade pineapple martinis and contemplating the spaghetti dinner we'd planned to make when the smell of BBQ wafted in the window.  We had one of those \"Are you thinking what I am thinking?\" moments and made for the door  in hopes of getting a table in between the bus loads of tourists.  (I kid you not there are at least 3-4 bus loads of Korean tourists there a day - they even have special bus parking in front.)\n\nWe got a table right away (thanks to good timing) and had the most delicious meal.  We grilled thin slices of spicy rib eye and marinated chicken at our table and had fun pairing bites of meat with the many side dishes.  MCM didn't much like the sizzling tofu soup but I thought it was fabulous.  We had enough food leftover to have a sizable lunch next day.  We're going back again for sure but with a bigger group so we can sample an even larger variety of dishes. \n\nThis place is worth the search for parking.

That's Korean for, \"damn, that tastes good.\" And everything I've ever had at Han Il Kwan tastes good. Granted, I'm a vegetarian, so I'm sure I'm missing out on the finest they have to offer. My brood swears by the bulgogi and kalbi. They can't bring it out fast enough, and they offer the option of letting them cook it, or grilling it at the table. But what's truly amazing is that, in this environment, my kids will eat all manner of ban chan without batting an eye. \n\nThe dishes are prepared by two ahjumahs that never leave the kitchen. These women are for serious. Service is mostly great, especially when someone in your group speaks Korean. In fact, this will almost guarantee you some free kim chi chiggae or pan dhuk. They lose a star, however, because of their occasional inability to seat customers AT ALL EVER due to a massive influx of Korean tourists. This spot is a routine dinner destination for the Big White Korean Tourbus circuit. I have seen three buses pull up, disengorge hungry passengers, and swamp the place. So be sure to call ahead to make sure no tours are scheduled, or to confirm some availability despite them. \n\nI generally order the be bim bap (vegetarian) or the kim chee dul sot (also vegetarian.) The latter is one of the most flavorful, savory, and irresistible things I have ever eaten. It comes in a scalding clay pot with a raw egg cracked over the top, that cooks as you stir the pot. While you eat, the bottom layer of rice forms into a crisp, creating a worthy reward for members of the Clean Your Plate club.  \n\nPair this with an ice-cold Hite, and we're in business. As is typical of Korean restaurants, there is no dessert to speak of, though they do bring the sweet rice drink that is a traditional closure to the meal. \n\nOh, one other thing...Han Il Kwan will donate 20% of your dining tab to my sons' PUBLIC school. That's right, PUBLIC school. San Francisco offers one of only two Korean Immersion Public school programs in the United States, and this restaurant supports the program with these donations, which we need now more than ever. It costs you nothing.

I had gone for the first time back in November of 2010 and enjoyed it.  This time around, my friends and I ordered a set dinner instead of picking individual dishes since there was a large number of us.  \n\nOverall, the meal was quite good.  While I don't remember every individual dish we had (there was egg, soup, plenty of meat), everyone had a great time.   It was better than the usual choice of Chinese or Sushi. \n\nIf there is a negative, the wait was longer than expected even though we had a reservation.  Apparently, there was large parties there so we had to wait until they cleared out and that took about 45 minutes.  \n\nHowever, I do recommend this place if you want some good Korean food.", "author": "Donald L."}

We put our names on the list and were told the wait would be 45 mins or so. During our wait, we saw groups of Korean tourists coming in the restaurant out of tourist buses. It was clear that the tourist groups have some business relationship with the restaurant so they were seated immediately after they came in. At first place, we felt this might not have to do with our wait and we just ignored it. Then the worst part happened after we waited there for 1 hour at 630pm or so. We went to a lady looking like store manager and asked why the waiting list was not moving and how long would we have to wait any longer. She replied it would be another hour wait. We were like this is insane. What she replied was even crazier. You guys can order now and wait so you don't have to order when you are seated. Of course we left immediately. This manager kept letting the people coming in with no wait and let us stand there for one good hour and did not give us any heads-up? It seems they cherish the tourist groups which I think very likely they have a very strong business relationship more than the local bay area residents like us who might come here every week. Surely I will never go back there wasting my time and felt frustrated with this kind of treatment.", "author": "David K."}

My wife and I prefer the non-marinated beef especially with the sesame oil and salt.  We love it when they provide for different kinds of beef and you really get a chance to experience a good meat taste and texture.  You never really get good quality beef when it is marinated in our experience.\n\nWe ordered the kalbi and rib eye...  mediocre beef.  Only good thing is that they provide good size portions.  We ordered the raw beef.  It's the largest raw beef dish I've ever had but doesn't do any good when the meet is still frozen.  Bim bim bab...  very bland.  Only the sweet hot sauce saved it.  The kimchee pancake was the only acceptable dish.\n\nService was also mediocre.  Once we started the burner, it started dripping water under the table.  We asked the waiter and his response was, \"oh don't worry, it'll stop\".  We put a couple of paper towels so that the dripping wouldn't splatter so much.  Thank goodness we did as the water was grayish black.\n\nAfter this experience, there's no need to try Korean bbq in San Francisco.

Kind of weird but very pleasant at the same time.\n\nA big plus for me is the after dinner mints they have there. They look like peppermint candy but they are the softer, buttery mints.

However, I finally found my way over for lunch and it was somewhat good timing.  From experience, lunch is usually a good time to eat especially when the restaurant is consistently popular and busy during dinner.\n\nMy experience however, was a little bit different.  While we beat the bus loads of Korean tourists, we had to wait a huge long time during.  There were only about 3-4 tables of two to four people...and only 1 waiter.  *Sigh*\n\nThe thing that I LOVE and HATE about Korean restaurants is the Ban Chan (Side dishes).  Great especially when you are super hungry, but not so when you only have one waiter slowly having to take orders, get drinks, preparing and serving all the ban chan,  bring out entee's and bussing tables full of small plates and hot iron plates.  All this while checking up on the tables making sure everything is well, and cashing out, and doing credit card transactions. This ONE poor waiter was rushing  to get everything done.  \n\nLoved the 8+ side dishes--great variety...but by the time they arrived, so had our entree's. \n\nAnd this I believe is the disadvantage of coming to eat at less busy hours: the lack of sufficient staffing!  \n\nAside from the extremely slow service from the poor waiter who I completely sympathize with, the food was good.  Ordered the lunch Bul Go Gi, meat was tender, and flavorfully sweet. Also ordered Jap Chae...*Eh*  Huge portion and very flavorful, but the noodles were thicker and chewier that I expected--became hard to chew at certain times, definitely wasn't soft and slippery as I enjoy.  \n\nOverall, food was good.

Pretty good if you're up for noodles.\n\n[[ Cold Noodle w/ Beef & Veggies ]] Yes, cold noodles. If you want to try something out of the ordinary, try this. It's noodles in cold broth. (Owner said Koreans eat this on hot days to cool down.) Doesn't hurt to try. It's kind of interesting and...cold. ^^\n\nThis place is a MUST TRY. *thumbs up*", "author": "Janice M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-13", "description": "I found this place on Yelp when I decided to research Korean BBQ restaurants.  I wanted to find an alternative to Brothers.  Now, I do love me some Brothers #1 on Geary, but you always, ALWAYS end up smelling like you spent the entire day standing in a pit oven.  \n\nThe food at Han was comparable to Brothers.  Some of the ban chan dishes were better, like the steamed scrambled egg thing that reminded me of chawanmushi.  Damn, that was good.  On par with most Korean restaurants, we got the free pot of tofu soup and the sweet rice drink at the end of the meal.  We ordered the Kalbi and Bulgogi to bbq at the table and also ordered the battered zucchini.  The meat was ok, not the best I've ever had.  The zucchini was good and lived up to my expectations.  Nothing will ever compare to homemade korean food so it's difficult for me not to be overly picky.  Service was also comparable to Brothers, a bit spotty and abrupt.  Yes, parking really is a bitch as every other review has mentioned.\n\nWhat really made Han II Kwan stand out for me was the cleanliness and the super efficient ventilation system.  The table was clean, the plates and silverware were sparkling, and even while we were cooking our kalbi and bulgogi at the table, there wasn't much smoke.  Granted, they use gas fire here instead of charcoal so that helps.   \n\nIn short, the food, service, and atmosphere earns this place an easy 3 stars from me.  But they get another additional star simply because my clothes and hair passed the smell test!  I got home and I don't smell like smoke AT ALL.  I could eat here on a date!  You will walk out of here without smelling like a slab of barbecued marinated beef!  That, my darlings, is the best reason ever to include this place high in your list of Korean dining options.", "author": "Courtney Y."}

I strongly recommend trying to avoid their tour bus hours. Not only is it immensely difficult to get seats, their quality of service deteriorates significantly as they tend to prioritize their tour bus customers over their walk-ins. \n\nThey seem to have a contract with a Korean touring company and if you happen to come by during those hours, you'll see endless mobs of tourists coming in and out of the fairly small restaurant.", "author": "Aaron H."}

Most people I know are pretty unfamiliar with real Korean food past kimchi, so this is a great place to take them for their first experience of it -- they are invariably impressed.\n\nThe key to eating here is understanding that you should order one dish -- usually just meat; I recommend the marinated ribs, the pork belly a close second -- per two people. No matter what you order you will get literally a dozen small appetizers with it, plus rice and soup, which are enough to fill up an ordinary person all by themselves. There is no chance you will leave here anything but stuffed.\n\nThey will also do the cook-at-your-table system here. This is a lot of fun (fire!) but actually less tasty, since the chefs are professionals at cooking this stuff and you, as an amateur, will tend to get it wrong and burn stuff. So I recommend letting them cook it for you.\n\nOn to the rating! My in-no-way-patented 5-star system:\n\nLocation: the Richmond. OMG, far away. You have to drive, and then there's no parking. NONE. No star.\nAtmosphere: clean, bright, friendly, not too loud, and full of Koreans. 1 star.\nService: rapid, attentive, friendly, generous, perfect. 1 star.\nFood: DELICIOUS.

Must be good if the Koreans are eating there so my husband and I decided to try it one day.\n\nThis place was pretty good. I got the dol sot bi bim bap and my husband got the tofu soup. While we waited they gave us some onion pancake like thing to try - it was ok but kinda greasy for my taste. Then came the banchan - the stuff that I especially love about Korean food. Came with a lot of the stuff I love - pickled bean sprouts, cucumber, kimchi, radishes, fish cake, and a few others. Sadly, they didn't have the chap chae (my favorite) or the potatoes (my husband's favorite). \nBut they were nice to refill our banchan when we were low so I am happy. \n\nMy bi bim bap came out sizzling and smelling wonderful. I enjoyed my dish and it's so filling, I couldn't even finish it. I had a taste of my husband's tofu soup and it's a little different from the ones we usually get but it was still delicious. Although, I got the beef bi bim bap, there wasn't that much beef in it so next time, I would rather get the veggie bi bim bap and save some money. Not that prices here are expensive and unreasonable. It's actually pretty cheap for bi bim bap - I've had ones where they cost much more and were not as good. \n\nSince we live near-by, we were able to walk.

Everyday, around 2-6, tour buses park right in front and unload a horde of Korean tourists.  This could mean one of three things: 1.  Han Il Kwan sponsors these Korean tour buses 2.  This place is that damn good or 3.  Han Il Kwan is a training camp for Korean militants...North or South, of this I am unsure.\n\nPlanning a most glorious forth of july evening for kvu that included no plan, we walked from my compound to 28th, turned around and back all the way to arguello to pick a random restaurant.  Unfortunately, everything was closed; I was disappointed because behind the veil of spontaneity, I really wanted to go to Sanmi.  However, we did have a delightful chinwag that she could not enjoy properly due to a wounded food.  Finally, we decided on Han Il Kwan because we were so close to my house.  It was pretty late when we arrived, about 9 yet the restaurant was still bustling.  There seemed to be a native Korean client base which means that the food was authentic, too authentic for casual eaters and non Koreans.  I was a little worried that I could not handle this.  We were asked what our preference was, bbq table or regular table.  I picked the table with the bbq just because it was a booth and looked more comfortable.  When we opened the menu, we learned that upon sitting here, you had to order 2 bbq items which were priced at about 20 bucks each.  As a result, I called my new roommate from Minnesota who galloped over in 30 seconds time and we ordered bulgogi, spicy pork and some jup chai? (sesame noodles) .  The bulgogi was tasty, however, for 20 bucks, the portions were not that generous.  We should have opted for them to cook it for us as my chef skills left some of the meat charred.  As a result, I put it on my roommate's plate.  The spicy pork was okay.  It was a bit spicy for me however, I won't use my shameful taste buds as an excuse to lower the rating.  I felt that the spice wasn't marinated as well as it should be.  It was a coating on the exterior of the pork, however, did not have time to meld with the meat.  I don't know if they marinated it on the spot or what.  The jup chai? was probably the best item out of those three.  It was sesame noodles with assorted vegetables and beef.\n\nIf Han Il Kwan is super authentic, then I guess I am not a fan.  All I really want when I eat Korean food is some cheese corn, tofu soup and unlimited bulgogi.  I am impartial to kalbi...i hate removing the bones.  As a result, I think I am more suited for AYCE aka Bob Sang.  Their ban chan was pretty exotic, highlighted by these jelly blocks.  All I ate was the pickled cucumbers.  My girlfriend had a higher opinion of the food than I did, echoing my sentiment for the sesame noodles.  The food was pretty expensive given the amount they gave you.  As a result, I have concluded that the \"tourists\" that come here aren't here for the food.  This place is a top-secret militant training camp.", "author": "Brian V."}

Most Korean restaurants give you a tiny teacup; then you have to depend on them to refill it. We can actually drink our fill!  They started us with a little pancake.  The bibampap was good.  The Jap Chee had lots of mushrooms and spinach.  We even got a little tofu soup.  Aw, our tummies were filled!  On major holidays, no lunch specials.  I just have to play hooky one day from work and go there for their lunch specials.  There's at least 7 options to choose from.

You know that means it's good.  Downside is that you can have a wait and the service felt lackluster.  We were a bunch of suburban moms coming in for a meal, and perhaps that doesn't get the wait staff excited.  Little did they know we had a sleeper agent with us; one of the group had a Korean boyfriend in college and therefore speaks fluent Korean.  So, when she busted out some Korean, the wait staff paid attention and our service improved.  Anyway, all the food was excellent, and my only beef (beyond the complaint about the initial service) was that one of the wait staff picked up raw chicken to put on the grill and lifted it over some lettuce & other sides, dripping raw chicken juice along the way.

When I arrived, I told him we changed our mind and we would also barbecue at the table. Once we got seated, he tried to MAKE US MOVE TO A NON BARBECUE TABLE because some customer who CAME IN AFTER US complained about it.  Apparently, he had promised them the barbecue table. Instead of telling them that the customers who came in BEFORE THEM had changed their minds and had the barbecue table, he had the BALLS to try to make me change tables.

Otherwise, she didn't stop BY ONCE to see if we needed more bahnchan, water, or anything else.  And she didn't change our grill even once, a pretty standard procedure in Korean restaurants that know what they're doing.\n\nWhy is it so difficult to find a decent Korean restaurant in SF???  If you want decent Korean food, I'd suggest going to Ohgane in Oakland. Worth the extra 10 minute drive.\n\nAvoid this place like the plague.

Maybe it's the generous use of egg in everything (dig that batter on the pan-fried shrimp).

I don't have a good frame of reference when it comes to Korean food, but pretty much everything I ate was delicious.  \n\nDespite being completely overwhelmed and defeated by the inordinate amount of food we received , the waiting staff must have felt we had not suffered enough because they also brought out a complimentary steamed egg dish and a shot of sweet rice milk(?) for dessert.

The flavor showed it.  Not good.  I also prefer real charcoal grills, which Han Il Kwan did not have.  But if you are going to use gas grills at least have a real grill on top.  We were given a perforated round metal plate that was way too thin and thus caused the beef to burn too easily (no, it wasn't a So Duuk Gong grill top....not shaped right, too thin, and a real So Duuk Gong doesn't have perforations).\n\nThe only saving grace was Sam Gyup Sal which was cut thick the way I like it.  But heck, that wasn't really the skills of the restaurant showing was it?  And we had to cook it ourselves....so no mercy points there.\n\nAnyway, my faith in things religious has been put into question for many a years now.

We love coming here for lunch to take advantage of their incredible deals!  To be fair, I have eaten my share of Korean foods and have definitely developed my own personal taste, but it's not anywhere near what the authentic standard should be. \n\nThey recently changed their prices abit, but it's still great.  We normally go for 2 of the meats: bulgogi ($8.95), kalbi (9.95), pork bulgogi and chicken ($7.50).  And sometimes either bimbimbap or japchae as well.  With each entree, it comes with rice, tofu soup or steamed egg, and some dessert sweet water.  They also have a good variety of appetizers.  The meat is on par with other good restaurants in my opinion.  \n\nThe service and staff is always very nice and generous about giving the extra stuff.

Looking for parking took so much longer than the actual wait time for a table! There were a lot of open tables still by the time we walked into the restaurant. The friends had all been here in the past and claimed it was delicious, it was my first time here. \n\nTheir menu offered your usual choice of Korean dishes- we went with jap chae, spare ribs, chicken, and bulgogi. They offer free tofu soup with the dishes so that was something different that you do not find often in other Korean restaurants. Their side dishes were pretty typical, bean sprouts, anchovies, kim chee, etc. The star of the side dishes i must say were these delicious fish cakes that had me asking for more one after another! I couldn't get enough of them! As a dessert for when you are done with your meal they serve the sweet rice drink that you can ask for refills on!\n\nThe reason this place is getting only 3 stars is because their service is just horridly slow. It definitely was not a busy night but the waiter/ess just did not seem to want to move!! We had a party of 7 and they gave us only one pair of tongs to cook all our meat. We had asked them for another pair and the nice man said \"okay\", but he just walked away and completely forgot about us. We asked again but with someone different this time, and the nice lady said \"okay\", but she too seemed to have forgotten. Finally my friend got up herself and went to the back to grab us some tongs. Same thing happened when we asked for a refill of the side dishes and tea. You have to ask multiple times over and over till you sound like a broken record till you actually get what you are asking for. Again it was NOT a busy night so we didn't understand why the service was so bad and slow. We never got our tea refilled btw, because they either just simply forgot or didn't want to refill it. \n\nOverall the food was tasty and the jap chae was one of the better ones I've had, but the service was not that great.", "author": "Virginia L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-14", "description": "I came here for lunch on a weekday.\n\nThe food:\n\nPros: I loved the wide variety of authentic korean dishes offered on the menu compared to other korean establishments in the city. Food included bbq, tofu soup, chop chae, seafood pancakes etc etc. We ordered a tofu soup and bbq beef short rib (kal bi). The tofu soup was just average compared My Tofu House on Geary. There was only one type of tofu soup offered and it was lacking the hot spice and overall flavor i was accustomed to in most tofu soups. On the BRIGHTER side, however, i must say that the kal-bi was excellent. It was perfectly cooked, consisted of the right portion of meat and fattiness, and very very flavorful. I could not stop eating the kal-bi. Furthermore, like most korean restaurants, han il kwan offered a number of small dish appetizers (ban chan). They offered an extended variety of appetizer dishes in larger portions when compared to My Tofu House. They offered fried pancakes w/ dipping sauce, steamed egg custard, kim chee, cucumber, etc etc. \n\nThe service + price:\n\nI think price-wise, it is comparable to most korean restaurants, maybe slightly cheaper for some items. The service was eh. The waiter seemed a little too strict with certain rules and acted like he didn't want to be bothered. For example, i witnessed a party of 6 come in for lunch and they approached the big round tables (there was no one but us in this restaurant). Before they seated themselves, the waiter quickly added that round tables were only for \"big parties.\" The party of 6 reiterated that they had 6 people, yet the waiter didn't want to hear anymore of it and simply gestured them to a smaller table and put the menus down. Those big round tables only had 8 chairs, two more than their party size. This, in addition to the glaring fact that there were no other people in this restaurant, reflects very poorly on the staff and management of the restaurant. \n\nOverall, i liked the food, variety, and price of this korean restaurant. The service was so-so and has potential for being worse than that, though i have not personally experienced anything unbearable just yet. Would i go here again? Probably and really only because there are few korean cuisine choices in the city and I would like some variety in my korean choices.", "author": "Nathan T."}

Well, 25 minutes has pass and the waiter just keep walking pass us as if we don't even exist.  Finally, he gave us a table that was empty in the very beginning. Then he gave us our menu, took him another 15 minutes to come back and take our order.  This will be my first and last time going there. \n\nFYI , don't even bother going inside if you see tourist bus parked outside.

I've been in this city for less than a year, so I realize my options are still pretty vast, and I've tried a few, but none of them even remotely resembled my experience at this place. \n\nUnder normal circumstances, I prefer chicken over beef 7 days of the week. However, when the lunch menu here didn't include any chicken options, I went ahead and reluctantly ordered the beef bibimbop. My routine would probably involve taking a bite or two of the beef to try it before pushing the rest of it off to the side of the bowl so I could focus my attention on the vegetables instead. Yeah, not a huge beef fan I guess.\n\nAs is customary with most Korean BBQ experiences, a sampling of great Korean starters appeared before us including soup, kim chee, bean sprouts, tofu, broccoli, and more. All of it was pretty decent. \n\nThen the bibimbop came a sizzling down before me. The rice was the perfect golden crunchy brown on the bottom and fluffy on top, the vegetables, flavorful.\n\n I ate every piece of juicy, perfectly-marinated beef in my bowl. In fact, while I did really enjoy everything else in my bibimbop, they could have served me a dish of just the beef and I would have left satisfied.\n\nAt the end of our meal, the waitress brought us some kind of sweet rice water and I dipped my fingers in it while my boyfriend fearfully took a sip.

The yummy food tastes clean and fresh. There was definitely love poured into making every dish scrum-dilly-yum-tious. \n\nThe place is great for large groups as they have several private back rooms and large circular family style dining tables. The wait staff is very attentive and never gives attitude to non-Korean folk. Although there is not much of a wait, the parking in the residential neighborhood alone is a time sucker in itself. The trick is to pull up front right when the tour bus parking expires around 9PM. Yeah, they have a tour bus permitted parking spot to bus Korean tourists here for some authentic dishes. Koreans from the homeland vouching for this Korean restaurant. Take that!", "author": "Cathy H."}

You even get a sampling of the Korean pancake, which is a nice surprise.\n\nThe tofu soup did seem a bit bland, but we think it was a matter of taste preference.  After all, every other dish was spectacular.\n\nParking in the Richmond is still frustrating, so we recommend that you either walk to carpool.

Han II Kwan serves either soft tofu soup or steam egg, bowl of a rice, and ban chan with the meals that is marked as such. Both our marinated chicken and bibimbop was marked under the category but we were only given one bowl of rice and a small stonepot of soup to share. MINUS ONE. I looked around and noticed other customers also sharing one rice bowl and soup too :( Our food came out and I soon forgot about it, plus there's rice in the bibimbop! We enjoyed our food, the bibimbop was perfectly cooked and the rice was crispy on the bottom just as I like it. The chicken was good too, with lots of meat. Both lunch specials were about $8. The owner then came out with a complimentary pancake, PLUS AGAIN! \n\nThe food was overall tasty and price was on point! We filled up our tummies and left with a doggy bag too.

Nonetheless the ban chan was good. \n\nOur orders finally came and it came out sizzling, how I like it! For the $20 I'd say it wasn't worth the tiny plate we got, but regardless the meat was well seasoned and NOT over cooked. Also the vermicelli was amazingly delicious!

The decor ain't pretty, and Korean food ain't cheap, but fir gut splitting joy, n lip smacking BBQ, I do believe Han II Kwan is the reasonable choice.   \n\nWe ordered half the menu, all the BBQ meat items (our party was 11 large so we had the cooks grill it, instead of grilling at the table ourselves), the tofu soup, the bi bim bop, meat dumplings, sea food cakes and clear noodles were all delicious!\n\nFYI - loads of families come here, so for an intimate first date experience, try somewhere else romantic.  As I waited for our table, a hoard of 6 children bum rushed me- squealing about some other kid who had \"cooties.\"  \n\nFYI II - if you have a big party, I noticed 2 private rooms in the back that looked accommodating, sadly we didn't get it, but maybe you can (request it).", "author": "Carolyn H."}

After 20 mintues of endlessly circling blocks and cursing the gods above, we finally found a parking spot mere steps away from the restaurant. Victory was ours, and it was sweet!\n\nSweeter still was the food. We shared a spicy cold noodle dish (bibim naeng myun), a spicy octopus stiry-fry, and a spicy rice cake dish (duk boki). The cold noodles were bouncy to the bite; the octopus was tender and tasty; and the rice cake was chewy enough to earn it a place in my heart and tummy. All three dishes were delicious, if a bit spicier than expected for our non-Korean (but nonetheless Asian) tastebuds. The portions were so large we ended up taking home roughly half of it. \n\nThe wait staff were all helpful and friendly. As indicated in previous reviews, they give you a few appetizer samples for free. We got 2 small green onion pancakes and a steamed egg custard type dish. The only slight downside to the meal was that they were understaffed, so it was difficult to get the server's attention for water/tea refills. \n\nAll in all, this place was well worth the hassle of parking!", "author": "Lillian L."}

You know they *should know good Korean food, and you know that this bus came all the way to Outer Richmond to get here. Yes, it was gonna be so GOOD. And we were not disappointed! I don't think the busloads of people were either. The restaurant, which had been mostly empty at that time in the day, filled up to the brim with large round tables of piping hot food. I know how they get so much business now!\n\nI came here the very first time as part of a large birthday group. I think perhaps the super large group was so distracting that I didn't properly enjoy the food. Since it's not far from home, I started coming more and more. I mean, you just know.. when it's good. I'm from LA and the K-town there, though incomparable, at least gave me some point of reference. This. is. good. Korean. food.\n\nI've had their kalbi, bulgogi, bi bim bap, kalbi tang, gom tang, etc etc. Flavorful soups, juicy and well marinated meat, fresh ingredients are all things that come to mind. Also, I love their side dishes - the best I've had in any SF Korean restaurant. Fairly larger plates than other places and they will gladly refill them for you. Good service.

Three (yes, 3!) busloads of Korean tourists came and went, giving the staff way too much to worry about. A lot of the non-tourists relegated to the booths were often forgotten.

Needless to say we got the general things like kalbi, everything was great. \n\nThen last night i stopped by to pick up some mandukk gukk because the last time i had some was a year ago. \n\nIt's this soup with chewy rice cakes that is to die for. for 8.95$ it comes with the usual sides which is one of the reasons i love korean food, accompanied with a box of rice. I'd say it's pretty darn worth it. Not to mention the waitress is pretty cute. This place is a must go if you're looking for some good korean food, oh and they do have a couple tables that they can cook the kalbi, or chicken right on your table or DIY if you perfer that way.", "author": "Terry S."}

You can't go wrong with any of the dishes here. It's almost like home cooked food. Their galbee (korean bbq short ribs) is great (the marinade is not too sweet or too salty).  My other favorite here is the tofu stew. \n\nService is really good here too. The owner is very attentive to your needs.

Even better than Sa Rit Gol in LA (which I think closed), and San Soo Gab San in Chicago.  The bulgogi is ok, but the KALBI is where it's at.  Man that stuff is good.  I'm having a food orgasm just thinking about it.  My other favorite dish is Jap Chae, which is fantastic here.  The stone bowl Bi Bim Bap is great, and the seafood and scallion pancakes here are yummy.  There seems to be only one guy that takes orders, and the Korean tour buses keep him occupied.  Like most Asian restaurants you have to be kind of pushy to get his attention, and it's best to know what you want to order right away unless you speak Korean and can get his attention.\n\nWe don't BBQ ourselves so that we don't smell for days.\n\nThis is one of the cleanest Korean restaurants I've been to.\n\nParking isn't fun in the Richmond, bring your smallest car.\n\nDid I mention the KALBI?!", "author": "J.

Although we had made reservations in advance for 6:30 PM, there was still a 20-minute wait because the restaurant was filled with 2 bus loads of tourists. When we finally got sat down at our table, the host had a very snappy, rude attitude. One of my friends was on the phone and wasn't listening when our group name was called, so the host bluntly lectured her that she should get off the phone and pay attention because he didn't have time to chase people around. Wow! This was appalling because the rest of us were paying attention--she was the only one trailing behind, but once she had realized, she immediately put her phone away. Nonetheless, the host's snappy attitude continued throughout the night. He was very impatient in taking our orders, spotty when it came to refilling our tea/water, and quick to deny our request for any banchan refills. He told us that if we wanted banchan refills, we would have to order more food. What?! Why should we have to order more food when we hadn't even finished grilling our BBQ meats or eating our other dishes yet? To be exact, we had ordered 4 BBQ meats and 3 other dishes. Plus, we had a group of 6, but he had only provided only a single serving of each banchan. Of all the Korean restaurants I have eaten at, I have never had the experience of being denied banchan refills until here. It was shocking! Perhaps the host had a stressful night, but nonetheless, his poor attitude was unacceptable. 1 star for the food; otherwise, negative 5 million stars for terrible service.", "author": "Emily C."}

Uh oh, are we in for a crowd? Nope! Luckily, the bus started its engine as we were entering the door. We were glad to see the group of satisfied Korean tourists piling into the bus.\n\nThey weren't able to seat us at a bbq table, but we were fine with that, since it was our first time and it was just the two of us.

We usually go to Korean Village (on Geary), but A said there was this place on Balboa that is pretty good and Korean tourists go there all the time, so it MUST be good.  He was telling me all about how tour buses are always stopped there and the people are, like, straight from Korea.\n\nSo we drive over there and circle around for about 5-10 minutes looking for parking.  We find a spot less than a block and a half away and walk to the restaurant.  There's only one other booth filled, so we were greeted and seated immediately.\n\nWe decided to get the kalbi and the octopus.  We have a tendency to over-order and, hence, overeat.  They brought out some mung bean pancakes on the house and their spicy soft tofu soup as well as the assortment of banchan.  I like the mung bean pancakes, but I never order them because each order always has like twelve pancakes in them and I can't finish them all.  So this was good.  The tofu soup was good - not too spicy - and good flavor.  I like the assortment of banchan.  There was one dish which was like pickled, shredded potatoes.  Definitely my favorite, hands down.  I love potatoes.  I polished that whole dish off pretty much by myself.  They do offer refills of the banchan, but, as other Yelpers have mentioned, once a tour group comes in, it's pretty impossible to get any attention from the wait staff.  And wouldn't you know it, not only did three additional parties come in to fill the booths, but a busload of Korean tourists came in too.  It's all about timing.  If you make it there before tourists arrive or after they leave, it's an awesome place service-wise.\n\nAs for food, the kalbi was pretty good.  I've had better, but it's definitely good here.  The spicy octopus with vegetables was good, but the octopus was super chewy.  I like octopus and they are chewy.  It was just still a little difficult for me to chew after the teeth extractions.

WIth the 5 of us, me plus 4 really hungry guys, we ordered 2 orders of kalbi, 1 order of spicy pork bulgogi, green onion pancakes, and soondubu.\n\nYou have to wait longer for a BBQ table (we waited 45 minutes). The spicy pork bulgogi is awesome here because of all the marinated flavor, and in my opinion, better than the kalbi. One factor could have been that we had to grill everything on our own, and maybe that affected the outcome of the meat.\n\nThe soondubu had no flavor, so I probably wouldn't go back to get that again. Green onion pancakes are thick and huge, and it comes with a lot.\n\nWith the free appetizers, they also brought a huge bowl of the egg, which was ginormous and the biggest bowl I've seen served at any Korean restaurant.\n\nTotal bill was only $89 for the 5 of us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-17", "description": "This is my first ever Yelp review.  The service was so horrendous here, I had to write about it.  We were seated at 7pm on a Saturday night for a table of 6 in the main dining room.  It was pretty busy, but not incredibly busy, as many tables were finishing up with their meals.  For the next 35 minutes, absolutely no one came to our table.  All we had were our menus and a couple failed attempts to flag down a waiter to order.  We finally got someone to take our order of Set Menu A and an additional chicken dish.  They immediately set down 2 pots of tea.  Finally, some service!  Not really.  We sat there for another 30 minutes after ordering with absolutely no one coming by our table again.  Not even the side dishes came.  I started looking around the restaurant and people who had sat down after us were already in the middle of their meals and even people who had sat down after we ordered were being served their meals!  After a few thoughts of just getting up and leaving, we flag down a waiter and he says our food is coming.  Finally, they start serving some side dishes and main dishes.  Everything comes out except for the additional chicken order.  We notify the waiter of this in the middle of our meal and he goes to the kitchen.  Just when we were about done eating, 20 minutes later, the chicken actually shows up.\n\nThey also don't even bother refilling tea pots.  Teapot lids on our table were open for most of the night, but of course the waiters just walked by them.  At one point, I actually held both tea pots in my hand and waved it toward a waiter across the room and pointed at the tea pots.  He gave me an acknowledgment as if he was going to come over in a minute.  Of course, he never came over.  At all.  I gave up.  \n\nYou would think that after not taking the order for so long and then not bringing our food out for so long, they'd try to do something to make up for things.  Nope.  Nothing.  The service was consistently horrible, at least for us, for the entire night.  From my observation, it seemed like we were the only ones at the restaurant getting bad service though, since everyone else was getting their food ahead of us.\n\nFood was decent, but I definitely won't be stepping foot through those doors again.", "author": "D T."}

Mainly because of a communication error that the restaurant made, and also because other places have better food than Han Il Kwan.  If you want to read the whole story then it's below.\n\nIt all started when I called at noon to see if they could accomodate a group of 10.  Person on the phone said yes and asked whether I wanted a regular table or a bbq table.  I told her the bbq table and she confirmed.  Later that evening, I called again to tell the restaurant that our party of 10 for the bbq table would be 20 minutes late.  The person who I spoke with told me it was okay.  Alright so when we arrived we were seated quite promtly.  They brought us in the back room and let us order.  I told them I was getting a couple orders of meat to bbq (here's where it starts going wrong) and the waiter told me that bbq was not available in the room because the air duct was not in service.  I told him I confirmed a bbq table for 10 and he told me that I called in and told them a party of 7 and later called in (when I called in to tell them we'd be late) and changed it to a party of 10...so they could do 7 outside to bbq but not 10.\n\nI was pretty angry then because of the error the restaurant made.  A couple of people haven't tried table bbq before and the main purpose was to let them try it.  At this time I was thinking \"Shit, I should've went to Brothers, why the hell did I choose this place\"  So okay...it's a hassle to leave now, so I just order.  I get 3 meat dishes and ask if tha't enough meat for everyone then the wait says, oh you need to order 10 things minimum in the room.  I'm thinking what the hell....first you trick me into thinking you could accommodate a party of 10 for bbq, then you stick me in a room where you can't bbq,now you tell me because I was forcefully stuck in the room that I have to order 10 things minimum. I went ahead and ordered and the waiter cut me a break with the 10 item minimum and probably saved me from having an aneurysm on the spot.\n\nNeedless to say, the dinner wasn't anything impressive.  The side dishes were at most just okay, everyone thought the bulgoki and the chicken was too dry and the portions of the kimchee pancake was too small.  I should have just went to brothers or wooden bbq.  I would have even drove to Choi's Family if I knew what was going to happen.", "author": "LittleBird 8."}

Nice!!\n\nFor dessert we had what I called sink water rice and sugar...not pretty, but good!!\n\nThe waitresses are very friendly and polite. Parking is not that great though.

It was only a Monday and at 6pm!!!  I walked in, asked for a table for 3, looked around to see many many tables available....the waiter was about to seat me but another person said something in Korean, the waiter then told me they are fully booked with reservations.  2nd, I tried calling today for a reservation for lunch time, 1pm...\"sorry, we have a big group coming in and we will be very very busy\"...OMFG...seriously, a table for 2 people would be too busy,  what's the point when I cant even call in ahead of time to get a table for 2 people??? they mind as well close off this restaurant and make it for TOURIST ONLY!  he said you can try to come in at 1 and see if we have any tables available...if you only have an hour lunch, why would you wanna do that?? I asked him, can I call a bit before 1pm to see if you have any tables? \"No, we can't do that\", oh and i forgot to mention, he said this to me at the end \"we don't make same day reservations\".....ridiculous...this place is not even an high end korean fancy ass rest....\n\nUpdate....so I finally got a table today by walking in! Yay, did I hit the jackpot? Anyway, my friend and I came here for lunch today, friend walked in first and this waiter totally ignored her while another waiter greeted her and sat her to a corner table. I honestly have to say that the food here is not bad. I'll give it 2 more stars just for the food...so a total of 3 stars for food. Service was AWFULL!!!!!!!

THIS place is the shit.. at first their hosting kinda because we were kind of ignored even though the server saw us.. also, I saw one of the customers just seat themselves after waiting for what seemed like about 6 to 7 minutes.. (mind you, there were plenty seats) anyways... I normally consume about 3 to 4000 calories... EASY in any given restaurant.. but these guys had so much food, that I was so stuffed.... it made me so happy.. I finally found a restaurant that filled me up so much to the point I did not want to move.. I still finished it.. I ordered the casserole soup and pork bulgogi.. and a complimentary steamed egg.. and like about 10 side dishes.. the casserole was amazing.. bulgogi,.. i'll say about 8 out of 10.. the price.. was very similar to other korean restaurants.. but there was so much food compared to other places.. that I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to anyone.. MInd you, I am korean.. and I've had pretty  good korean foods throughout my life.. this place definetely did its justice.. and It was also lovely because while there wasnt much parking, there werent many cars roaming around so No pressure trying to parallel park while 5 million people are waiting behind you!!!!!..

We asked her if there was a minimum based on the amount of people seated and she said no. So, we didn't order more (we ordered $50 worth of food already) and we later saw her gossiping about us with her coworkers. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL! They even had the nerve to point and glare at us! In addition to this, the flame on our grill kept going out and they ignored us as we tried to get their attention.When they finally came, they made it seem like it was a hassle to come over. They didn't even come to refill our tea or side dishes once. The cooking surface was covered in debris and they were too lazy to brush it off. The flame never came back on. We were so irritated that we boxed up the still rare meat, deciding to just cook it at home. Keep in mind, we only ordered two small plates of meat.

I'm from Korea, and I always thought that to get good Korean food you have to go down to South Bay if you live in SF. But this place proved me wrong. My friends and I could smell the BBQ of this place on the way to here on a hungry Saturday night. I'm pretty sure we'll head back there again sometime very, very soon.\n\nPros:\n-Lots of menu options, so you can bring your vegetarian friends too. They eagerly left out the meat gladly when we asked for it.\n-BBQ meat were large in portion than I thought - enough for two people per order. Unless you're a meat lover and decided to fill yourself up with pounds and pounds of meat.\n-Few special side dishes were on the house. Maybe because we filled a big table with a pretty big order for 5 people. \n-Other regular side dishes were tasty too. Kimchi was on the more anchovy-side (Kimchi is usually made and seasoned with anchovy paste for saltiness and flavor), which I like, but some of my non-Korean friends weren't a fan. We didn't need to ask for refills because we ordered so much food we barely finished the main items. But I have no doubt that they will be more than eager to do so.\n-When asked for the grill plate change, it was done promptly. Again, this could be because the place wasn't that crowded at 10pm on Saturday. (FYI: if you get any kind of meat with thick marinade, such as spicy beef or pork, it'll probably char up the grill quickly. Koreans usually grill the meat separately on different parts of the grill, or grill lightly marinated meat first and then move on to thick marinade.)\n-Complimentary shot of Korean dessert drink, Shik Hae (Sheek-Hey). Used to be my favorite traditional dessert when I was growing up. It's cream-colored, sugary, and has traces of rice grains in it. Think of white beer with some natural sediments, only white instead of yellow.\n\nCons:\n-Sort of secluded from other restaurants and stores in the area, although I don't know if it's a real con.\n-Some servers might appear more clumsy and less attentive and friendly.

When we arrived, there were indeed a couple of tour buses but one of them was leaving. Luckily, we only had to wait 20 minutes before we got our table.

I really enjoyed the rice cake when it was hot and fresh because the sauce was so good along with the soft bland tubes of rice cake.  It's a very good combination.  In addition, the kimchi pancakes were very flavorful and we can taste the kimchi.  It's slightly crunchy on the outside and soft of the inside.  If you let it sit a little then it becomes soft. Overall, the experience was very good and the food is very good.", "author": "Anh W."}

First, the decor: it's got the outside inside thing going on, with little sloped Japanese style roof tiles and beams slanting in, and little red lanterns hanging down. The booths are spacious, and the center is filled with smaller tables (no grills), and there are also two or three big party rooms in the back. Yes, we had to wait for about 40 minutes, but I think that's a sign of a good restaurant. Once we sat, we didn't wait long for our food, and I was thrilled that they brought out about 15 little dishes of Korean appetizers to try while we waited (complimentary with every meal), tiny fried fish, kim chee, bean curd, and lots and lots of veggies, prepared in different ways: YUM. Then they brought the meat- we ordered marinated chicken and beef and cooked it right there at the table (it smelled sooooo good!) We wrapped it up with rice in the large lettuce leaves they brought us. They also brought us some spicy tofu soup that was really good, and apparently complimentary. I don't know if it was extra or what, but it was nice that it landed on our table. At the end they bring you little rice dessert drinks, which were also delicious but I could barely get down because I was so stuffed. Note: they make you order two BBQ items if you sit at a table with a grill, which is a LOT of food for two. When they served us I immediately understood why everyone we watched eat before us had so many take home containers.", "author": "Sara B."}

Then your doctor snakes a camera up your nether region and pumps your colon full of gas, giving you the worst gas cramps ever, then you spend the next 6 hours farting it all out.\nBut there is a silver lining - after enduring this whole horrible ordeal, you can go binge yourself at Han Il Kwan and eat all the kalbi and bulgogi you want because lets face it, you've got alot of empty space in your stomach to fill.  Deliciously marinated meats and a plethora of side dishes can be enjoyed in a bright, non-smokey dining room.

So while I was eating I saw a old guy was writing down all the license plate numbers parked at the tour bus zone, not wanting to have a parking ticket I went outside and asked him what was the problem and he turns out to the guy live next to the restaurant and said well you guys are not supposed to park here it is a tour bus zone and you need to move. Pissed off at him but I got no choice what if he calls the DPT and they came give me a ticket so I moved my car which is about 3 blocks away (I ended up order one more meat), anyway back to the review the food is great, I especially liked their BBQ meat which tastes much better than Brothers and other Korean restaurants I have been to so far. But ther side dishes are lack of varieties. Their seafood pancake (number 40 on their menu) is below average and their kimchi chege is the worst, maybe it is because the restaurant was full at the time and there were only two people working at the front.

We were thinking Thai, but then another friend already had Thai that day, so we decided on Korean since we haven't had it in a while.  This place had a great menu.  Not many items on the menu was vegetarian, but they do have vegetarian stuff.  We got the tofu soup, kim chee pancakes, and crispy rice pot thing.  They brought out a lot of side dishes and gave us everything including the non vegetarian items.  This is good cause only two of us at the table was vegetarian.  The food was good.  They gave us a lot of \"on the house\" items, which is a big plus and an extra star.  At first we got some other pancake thing and thought, that's it for $12, three pieces?  It was one of the many items they provided on the house turns out.  I won't say no to that (unless it was non veg of course).  Everything is all and well, but afterward, I did get hella thirsty.  The food probably had a lot of sodium or yikes, MSG?  I hope not.  It didn't bug me like MSG would, so I think it's probably just a lot of sodium.

The waiter went out of his way to avoid eye contact when I wanted to ask for a couple more napkins. It was more important for him to set up a back room than to take one minute to stop by ours.  I understand not to expect much in the way of customer service in Korean restaurants, but this was ridiculous. When the waiter brought one of the entrees, I asked for more  of a couple of the ban chan, and was told it would \"cost more\"  First time that has ever happened to me when paying dinner prices somewhere.  Speaking of the ban chan, it was underwhelming.  The fish cake was under seasoned.  Three of the 9 dishes were a variation on cucumber. No fresh cabbage. Nothing with much spice or heat.  The seafood stew was pretty good.  Kalbi was also pretty good,  higher quality meat than some. I couldn't understand why the kalbi was served almost 15 minutes after stew. The place was nearly empty.  Overall fair to good food, but the extremely poor, actually rude service will keep us from returning.", "author": "Steve N."}

One either has the best tofu soup but not so good (or enough) sides, or their bibimbaps are everything that I've dreamed of but their bbq is only meh. That being said, Han Il Kwan is one of my favorite places to get Korean BBQ. I LOVE their pork marinated in the spicy house sauce and they always give you additional dishes that are \"on the house!\". I've only ever bbq'd and eaten tofu soup here so I can't speak for their other dishes but all the meat that I've ordered here were of good quality, except for the fact it's poorly sliced sometimes and you end up having to hack at huge pieces w/ a pair of scissors before you can put it on the grill...  I also thought that it was kind of strange that they asked if we wanted the meat cooked for us. Why would I go to a bbq joint and not cook it myself? It's a part of the fun! I guess some people aren't as into it... The smell of bbq tends to seep into your fingers, hair, clothes, everything - it's unavoidable even though their ventilation system here is excellent. Just be careful how you bbq though b/c my friend and I got yelled for not doing it \"right\". I still don't understand. We put the meat on grill, the meat was cooked thoroughly, and then we ate it. What did we do wrong? WHAT?", "author": "Queenie C."}

We go for lunch quite often and there is only one guy who does everything! He seats people, takes orders, brings out the food, buses the tables and is the cashier as well. More than one occasion he told us to wait 10 minutes or sometimes 20 minutes in the waiting area, that only has one chair, before he can seat us even though there are tables available. Its ridiculous!! They need more people working on the lunch shift.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-21", "description": "I just tried Han Il Kwan for the first time and decided to post my initial impressions, though there will be more to come.\n\nToday I tried the Oxtail soup (ggori gom tang), but I must state up front that this isn't exactly a fair review because they neglected to give me any salt (I ordered to go), but then again that itself is something consider.  \n\nNaturally the soup was very bland, but aside from being unseasoned, the broth was not very rich and the meat was not nearly tender enough -- it was stuck to the bones.  This makes it obvious that they did not give it the time and love that a good oxtail soup requires.  They also cut the sections of oxtail into slices, bone and all, which is neither bad nor good, I suppose.  What is not good, however, is it appears that they may trim away the ligament surrounding the caps of the oxtail, stripping it of much that delicious gelatinous collagen that you suck away from the bone.  Either they trim it or just don't procure very good product.  That was quite disappointing.  The oxtail soup is fresh; I'll give them that much.\n\nI have better things to say about the banchan; it was pretty nice.  With my take-out order they included a large 4-section piece of very good plastic-ware filled with pickled cucumber, bean sprouts, seaweed salad, a small piece of mung bean cake, and both radish and cabbage kimchee.  The cucumbers were fresh and still crisp with a nice refreshing sweet vinegary flavor that wasn't overbearing.  The bean sprouts were a little under-seasoned and I would have liked more sesame oil flavor, but they were fine.  The seaweed salad had a similar but sweeter/stronger flavor than the cucumber that was appropriate for the pungency of the seaweed.  The cabbage kimchee was pretty good and \"fresh\" (i.e. not from a supermarket jar or even worse, bag) but could have had a deeper, more rounded flavor (I get spoiled by my mom's); it was slightly on the milder side of fermented, but not spicy enough for a Korean.  The mungbean cake was so-so but needed some kimchee or meat because it was pretty darn plain, though I don't expect much from banchan bindae duk.  The kkakdugi radish kimchee was the best of the bunch.  Big and chunky with just the right amount of crunchiness and fermentation with the flavors running straight through to the middle of each piece --- would have been perfect for the soup if the soup had some salt!\n\nIn conclusion, my first experience here was promising enough to warrant a return visit, considering the poor competition in the Bay Area.  At $13 after all was said and done, it's not a great value, but probably par for the course in SF.\n\nI'll have to bring some friends and eat in next time to dig into some interesting stuff.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-02-09", "description": "Not to be a jerk, but this place really doesn't deserve 4 stars. Sorry. Read on for why.\n\nSome 15-20 years ago, Han Il Kwan was under different ownership and had delicious Korean food. The owners moved on and, I believe, opened up Koryo Wood Charcoal in Oakland, which is a far, far superior restaurant in every possible way (except price if you're pinching pennies).\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a condescending, arrogant snob (sorry), I can only assume that the high review scores given to this restaurant are coming from folks who are not familiar with authentic Korean food (told you I'd come off like a snob). Being Korean myself, and having frequented much better restaurants (Brothers in San Francisco, Koryo in Oakland), I can say that this place is competent, and the best thing about it is the prices, which are a bit on the low side. Some of the cheaper soup/stew dishes, for instance, clock in at just around or under $10.\n\nThe \"new\" Han Il Kwan's cooking and preparation are competent and the food is definitely palatable, but nothing will set your soul afire. Also, and unfortunately, if you happen to have a taste for genuinely spicy Korean food, nothing here will set your tongue on fire either, since the spicier dishes, such as the yookyejang (spicy boiled beef stew) and kimchichigae (boiled-\"kimchi\"-spicy-cabbage stew) aren't really all that spicy at all. Please keep in mind, however, that this review is being written by a Korean fellow who has prefers his food SPICY, so if you have trouble handling spicy stuff, you may want to avoid the spicier dishes altogether and go with something milder like gomtang (non-spicy boiled beef stew), naengmyun (cold buckwheat noodles in cold broth--NOT bibimnaengmyun, which are cold buckwheat noodles in spicy sauce), or mandugook. And yes, with that last sentence...there's that pompous snob coming out again.\n\nHan Il Kwan apparently has some sort of deal with various Korean travel agencies; it's not uncommon to see one or more tour buses parked out in front of the restaurant around dinnertime on the weekends as Korean tourists pour out and pile into the restaurant. This is probably one of the more devious marketing maneuvers I've seen in a while, and weekend attendees at this restaurant may find themselves to be very impressed at the great number of REAL LIVE KOREAN PEOPLE who are patronizing this restaurant (much the same way that I'm patronizing anyone reading this review). Unfortunately, they're not here for the food; they're here because this is where the tour bus happened to stop. Brothers Restaurant on 6th and Geary otherwise has this place beat with fresher ingredients and flat-out tastier food. Presumably, it'd be harder to get a tour bus deal in the middle of Geary, which is, of course, the Richmond district's worst road in terms of traffic snarls.\n\nCons: Non-amazing food, non-amazing banchan, non-amazing spice level for soups and stews. Parking is also a serious pain in this neighborhood because it's residential, and parking spots in the Richmond district in general are laid out in a stupid manner that's extremely unfriendly to large cars. You may just want to take the 31 Balboa bus here if that's an option. It stops right in front of the restaurant.\n\nPros: Again, the 31 Balboa stops right in front of the restaurant, if that means anything to you. The restaurant also gives complimentary mini-bindaeduck (fried mung bean pancakes) with the purchase of every sit-down meal, and gives \"banchan\" side dishes that are plentiful, though they aren't amazingly fresh or flavorful. This place can also be a bit easier on your wallet, and the service is quite good, which is why I gave it the benefit of the doubt and 3 stars, rather than 2.\n\nIf you're looking for Korean food on the cheap and live nearby, Han Il Kwan is worth it for a quick, inexpensive meal with friends or family you know fairly well and don't need to impress. I realize that last part is a pretty backhanded compliment at best, but let's face it: I'm a pretty backhanded guy.", "author": "A P."}

On one random occasion, my family and I decided to check the restaurant out. Like any other Korean restaurant they serve you with the many small appetizers. The sardines and that fish cake was mm mm good. I've tried almost everything there except for the stuff you cook at your table. I'm not a fan of that stuff because it makes your clothes smell. On a cold night, I recommend the tofu soup because it just has the right amount of spice. Sometimes the tofu soup is on the house..I guess it depends on how much you order. If you decide to drink soju there, then try the one with a white label with gold letters. I don't know what the brand name is but the soju was good enough to not get you hammered. And make sure you save some room for the dessert they serve you in a cup.\nThe service for here is superb.

I figure that if tour bus operators bring authentic Koreans to this place, then the food must also be authentic. So one day I acted on my curiosity and got me and my family a table. We ordered bul go gi and short ribs. I thought at first that I must have inadvertently ordered too much food, but I realized that this place give a bountiful of portions. We love the food and the service is just right. In fact, on one of our visits, I asked the name of the tea they serve, and the waitress gave me a handful that I can brew at home. That was very kind of her, and I think it shows the kind of place this is. I believe it's a family run restaurant. It has a nice low key family atmosphere.
