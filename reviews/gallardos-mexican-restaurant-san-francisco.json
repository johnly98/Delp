We went for lunch with a group of 10+ people. The fact that they accept reservations makes it very effortless and convenient. A few minutes into us sitting down at our table, baskets of chips and bowls of salsa & guac were placed onto our table for us to snack on. Shortly after, we noticed we might have some additional colleagues joining us so we asked for if we could add another table to the end. The staff was extremely accommodating and understanding. Two of the colleagues got the pozole which looked absolutely mouthwatering. I'm definitely trying that next time. Many of us got the combination plates with the many different options, such as two enchiladas or one enchilada with a tostada, etc. The food is delicious and the portions are huge. Most of us struggled to finish the combination plate. \n\nWe were celebrating two birthdays and the restaurant staffs were so kind to celebrate with us. They surprised our table with a plate of fried plantains and flans! It also happened to be the first day of Autumn for their culture so they decorated the dessert plate with a lot of fall colors and topped it with two candles. \n\nIt's hard to believe that the bill only came out to $170 with tax and tips included for a table of 12! It's so hard to find good food at a decent price in the City nowadays, so I'm so happy that Gallardos offers the best of both worlds!", "author": "Linda H."}

I came here sick because I was craving some pozole and this place blew my mother effing mind and overdelivered on flavor.\n\n*Food*\nI got the pozole and a horchata- internally asking myself if it would be worth getting a cold drink since all I could taste was my own snot. They started me off with some crisp, perfectly oiled, housemade tortilla chips and salsa served from a plastic container for you to spoon on to your chips, not for dip. The salsa is spicy, leaving me drinking 3/4 of my horchata before even getting my pozole - but tasty enough for me to finish my basket of chips with the fresh squishy blocks of tomato from the salsa. The horchata tasted housemade, not too sweet, and with the nice grit you expect from OG-non-artificial horchata. \n\nShortly before my pozole arrived, my server stopped by my table to give me 3 stacked wooded plates. On top were limes, under that oregano, and under that some hot looking spice that I assume was Achiote. Please correct me as I am a pozole amateur. They were also substantial amounts of spices that I definitely was not going to use for my soup. But she didn't stop there, she handed me a plate with shaved cabbage, radishes, sour cream, and tostadas. AND THEN, a container for 3 hot and fresh tortillas.\n\nTHEN my pozole arrived which was a hot, warm, steamy, good for the soul soup. In my heart I immediately thought, DAMN I'm going to be full af after all this food and VALUE MEAL. Feel free to split this meal with 1-2 other people. \n\nI spiced my soup to taste, I like it extra tart so I squished all the lime wedges, enough to make a baby's face pucker up. A little BAM of the oregano and a little BAM of the achiote. Nobody looked at me and thought I was weird because this in San Francisco for crying out loud. \n\nAnd then I took a heaping spoonful of the soup, put it in my mouth, and I was sent all the way back to Mexico City. Life was compelte and in that moment I felt that all of my illness was gone. Praise be. The meat in the soup came off the bone and on the bone, suggesting you to place it on top of the crisp tostada, dabbing it with some sourcream goodness and the light and fresh cabbage. Crunch after crunch, sip after sip my soup disappeared until I saw an empty bowl with red and green specs of spice. And in that moment my heart sank only to realize that it was all over. \n\nI looked up to realize that the entire restaurant had turned over. What a roller coaster of emotions. \n\nCome eat here if you want your hear, soul, and belly nourished.", "author": "Geronimo Carlo R."}

There were charred meat scraps on the quesadilla - not an issue for me, but could be for someone with food restrictions. Prices listed on menu were incorrect. Cash only, though this was not apparent, and a $30 bill seems a bit much for cash only. Service was pleasant but not particularly attentive, especially given that there were not many other diners. Styrofoam take-out containers.

Being from San Diego and having visited some of the best Mexican food in the USA, I was very disappointed in Gallardo's.\n\nI ordered the carne asada plate, which to me is the sign of a good Mexican restaurant if done right.  It was brought to me completely well done to the point of being tough.  There was no sear, which told me it was either boiled or pan fried in its own juice.  It was absolutely bland with NO salt added whatsoever.  I kept trying to pair each piece with other things on the plate just to get some salt.  Nothing helped.  Also, the beans were cold and the rice was clumpy.  A fresh plate from the kitchen shouldn't have food that's cold if it's not meant to be.\n\nMy husband ordered the enchiladas and the corn tortillas were chewy and dry as if they had been sitting out all day.  There was little salt and flavor in his dish as well.  There was a minuscule amount of enchilada sauce as well and you'd expect them to be drowning in it.\n\nThe biggest issue was lack of salt and seasoning of any kind.  I shouldn't have to pile other things onto the carne asada just to make it taste better; it should stand on its own.", "author": "Jake B."}

What I am about to address may have been an honest mistake, but should not go un-noted. As avid restaurant-goers should know, restaurants add gratuity on the bill for big parties. I am completely okay with that, except that the bill they gave us wasn't a conventional bill, but just an empty paper with only a dollar amount. There were no line items of the dishes we ordered or mentioning of gratuity being added as part of the bill. If this is their everyday practice, I have no doubt in my mind that some big parties unknowingly pay extra tip on their bill. This is a typical way for servers to make extra tip money as I have seen this being done before. They did apologize, but still PLEASE BE AWARE WHEN GOING TO THIS RESTAURANT WITH A BIG PARTY.

Since I only have a half hour lunch and have to eat at work, I always get my food to go. The restaurant is lovely, though and the wait staff are really friendly, so I'm really looking forward to \"eating in\" some time.\n\nMy favorite item is caldo de pollo (or chicken soup to us gringos.) The large is very big and comes with TWO WHOLE LEGS. A great broth and nice veggies, make this a wonderful soup for a cold day, OR when you're fighting a cold. With the garnish of lots of cilantro, limes, chopped onions, along with plenty of corn tortillas, it is a great meal all by itself.", "author": "Mike D."}

From the minute you walk up to this place and see its wonderful sidewalk garden you know that this isn't a run-of-the-mill burrito shack.  Inside it is gorgeously decorated with beautiful stars of the silver screen all over the walls.  It is a very warm, colorful, and inviting atmosphere.  \n\nA great place for large group dinners to celebrate since they have lots of seating and a great atmosphere for that.  The food is wonderful and the chef's are high-quality and seem to enjoy their work.  This place reminds me of how a business should be and can be run.\n\nWith lots of unappealing, overcrowded whip-cracking mexican food places around the Mission, Gallardos stands out as a real breath of fresh air (figuratively and literally).  I feel good about supporting them and the business they run.  \n\nand let's not forget the food is high-quality with very decent portions and an excellent amount of variety in the menu.

It's kind of like off of Mission and 18th between Shotwell. It's kind of in a not safe area kind of ghetto place, but it's good to go during the day they have a lot of pictures. The food is semi good. I give it 2 star on the service because they only speak Spanish and the tables were dirty and it took us 10 minutes to try to get someone to clean it they speak broken English which was hard to communicate.\n\nSo, hopefully when you go here, someone is fluent in Spanish & English. They have broken English, and they could understand, and you just point to the menu lol and hopefully they get it right. I've had better food but this is a little bit home cooking I guess. \nAnd we all enjoyed it, it was good it held us until we ate that night.\n The one thing that looks really good and tasted homemade were the corn tortillas that reminded me when I was little when when my mother used to make them.\nNow those were good and the homemade salsa that was on fire it's not hot at first, but then all of sudden your mouth is burning. I give that a three star\nThanks for Reading! ~ Liz~  :)", "author": "Lizzie G."}

The plate was complete with salad, crema and guacamole though it did not say so.  A slice of tomato had the green pit still in it (Yuck). Served with large, thick corn tortillas and that was good.

We were accommodated at a larger table with enough eating room for all of us. My younger siblings ordered quesadillas, which they seemed to enjoy. The grown ups got the Menudo dish. Let me tell you, their Menudo is seriously authentic and delicious. If you're a Menudo fan, you've gotta try Gallardo's (but don't tell your friends because I want this place to be my little secret!) \n\nAs we were leaving my cousin started talking to the owner, who seemed genuinely interested in his customers satisfaction.

I even tried to practice my Spanish and the lovely servers, las mujeres, obliged. I sat outside and had huevos con chorizo, which I didn't care for, because the eggs virtually disappeared into the chorizo mix. But, this might be my fault as I think the server asked how I like my eggs in Spanish, but I didn't catch her super speedy drift.

A plethora of fixings - chopped cilantro, diced onion, quartered lime, sliced cabbage, cubed radish, red pepper flakes, sour cream, and Mexican oregano - accompanied the savory, rich, meaty broth of the pozole.

I entered huevos rancheros into the search box and Gallardos was the first place that popped up - for good reason.\n\nI'm not from Mexico, so take for it what you will when I call this place authentic, but it sure does feel like it to me. Fresh, homemade corn tortillas, spicy salsa, the scent of fresh food cooking wafting through the room. What else could you want? I, of course, got the huevos rancheros with a \"side\" of their birria, their weekend special. \n\nNow birria and I have a very long relationship - the first time I tried it I was down in Rosarito, Mexico on a spontaneous weekend road trip down to Mexico. The circumstances of why our group thought it would be a good idea to drive from San Francisco to Mexico on a whim, I am unsure. However, what I am sure of is the fact that it was on that trip when I discovered what birria was and fell in love. For those of you who don't know, birria a Mexican soup, usually cooked with lamb (this is also the way Gallardos serves it), and it is amazing. It's exactly your answer to a Saturday/ Sunday morning hangover and the best comfort food. Now, I am not lamb's biggest fan, and I was hesitant to try the birria here for fear if it being too gamy. Gamy it was, but in a good way. I could eat it and the spices - chiles, etc., did a good job of easing the intensity of the gamy flavor. Gallardos serves the birria with their thick tortillas and those alone are to die for.\n\nWe walked in and got a table immediately, but as we were eating, a short line formed out the door. Also of note is that this place is cash only, so don't forget to grab some before you come. I'll definitely be coming back here next weekend.", "author": "Patricia K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-29", "description": "One of the many benefits of working in the Mission District is the abundance of Mexican restaurants and taquerias to choose from on a daily basis. While my co-worker and I Yelp'd our way to find a new place to try, he brought up Gallardos, a Mexican restaurant that he had visited a few weeks prior and couldn't help but recommend. I'm not one to ever turn down a new Mexican spot and we made our way down to their 18th Street address.\n\nGiven that this was a Monday, I can safely say that 1 of the 2 of us were hungover, and I was already salivating over the pictures fellow Yelpers have uploaded. We were both surprised by how busy the restaurant was until we realized it was a Martin Luther King Jr. day and a holiday for most people. Luckily since we were a small party, we were quickly seated without having to wait.\n\nThe cute waitress brought over some menus and took our drink order and brought us some chips and salsa. The menu is rather long and has plenty of options with many entrees around the $10 mark, with only a select few costing in the $15 range. After looking over the extensive menu, I settled on combination plate #3, enchiladas rojas. The plate includes two enchiladas with your choice of chicken, steak or pork, covered in red sauce and served with rice and beans. I chose to go with chicken and as far as beans, you have pinto, black, and refried to choose from.\n\nUnfortunately this is where service began to deteriorate. I understand that the restaurant was busy but it didn't seem slammed and even receiving our two drinks felt too long. Once we did receive our drinks, we were out of chips and that took just as long. As for our food, it took longer than we expected but luckily for us, we weren't on a time crunch. I will admit that once the food hit the table, it looked mouth-watering delicious. Also, I did appreciate that both plates were delivered together and not staggered.\n\nA few bites and I will say that everything tasted A-OK, it was by no means earth shattering but it was better than your standard taqueria fare. The ingredients felt fresh, the pinto beans were done right, and the enchiladas were stuffed with shredded chicken, and topped off with plenty of salsa roja and smothered in melted gooeyness. It was definitely the right choice for a hangover Monday, not to mention the side of rice and guacamole included on the plate. My co-worker was equally pleased with his plate and once everything was said and done, we were both stuffed.\n\nHowever as far as service, it was pretty much nonexistent after our food was served. It was difficult to try and get refills on water and some extra napkins. It seemed rather odd considering that the rush was dying down but for whatever reason, we seemed to be forgotten. Even getting the bill was difficult and took a few minutes, but nonetheless, I'm open to give Gallardos a second chance. The food felt homemade, fresh, and was reasonably priced given the sit down service and portion size. I hope to have a better experience, service wise the second time around.\n\nAmbiance/Decor: 3/5\nFood: 3/5 \nService: 2/5\nPrice: $$\nOverall: 3/5\n\nPros:\n+ Large menu with most prices around $10 with a high of $15\n+ Food tastes authentic and fresh\n+ Sit down, restaurant service \n+ Nice atmosphere and decor\n+ Reasonably priced\n+ Beer and wine available\n+ Credit cards accepted\n\nCons:\n- Slow service", "author": "Alexander E."}

It was first rate.  We had the same dish at the nearby San Jalisco a few weeks back and it is difficult to pick between the two.  The SJ dish had more bones, which I like, although Gallardo's version made for easier wrapping in the tortilla.  SJ came with beans and rice while the Gallardo's version did not include any sides.

Not because your fly is down or you have a protruding camel toe but because they're probably wondering WTF you're doing there. Blame it on Yelp.\n\nWe walked into Gallardos in search of authentic Mexican comfort food and were welcome with stares from all the native patrons. No hipsters in sight. We were definitely in the RIGHT place. \n\nA family owned and operated restaurant, Gallardos seems to be popular among families as we saw many Mexican families partaking in Sunday brunch. They have a fairly large dining area split into 2 sections so it's good for groups. Gallardos has on overwhelming menu: Mexican breakfast items, American breakfast items, omelettes, salads, soups,  tacos, quesadillas, burritos, sandwiches, tortas, burgers, seafood plates, meat plates, and combination plates BUT the thing to order is their sopas (soups). They'll soon be moving to 18th street so do call ahead of time to see if they're still open at their current location across from Foods Co.\n\nCash only on the weekends.\n\nThey were out of Birria, their specialty so I ordered a large bowl of Menudo (weekends only - $9) and Mr. NSS ordered a large bowl of Caldo de Res ($9). While we waited for our order, we received a complimentary basket of chips and salsa: http://bit.ly/16cQtua. The warm chips were thin and crunchy with just the right sprinkle of salt. Like crack, it was purely addicting. We also ordered Guacamole ($5.50) which as you can see should have never been served in the first place: http://bit.ly/12UFrqs. \n\nMy eyes glistened as our two steaming bowls of soup arrived. Comfort in a bowl, the menudo was chock-full of tenderly soft honey comb tripe in a robust crimson mild chili broth: http://bit.ly/ZfTiTZ. There was also a huge pig's feet and knuckle that was a gelatinous sensation in the mouth. I know pig's feet may sound gross to many but it's truly a delicious delicacy that should be tried at least once. Menudo is my ultimate Mexican comfort food and this was by far the BEST bowl of menudo I've had.\n\nThe Caldo de Res is meat and potatoes in a bowl: http://bit.ly/11QCA0I. With large beef shanks, potatoes, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini and corn in a homey broth, the Caldo de Res is served with rice and beans, making it one hearty dish.\n\nAside from the no bueno Guacamole, everything was 5 star worthy. The sopas were amazingly comforting while the service was very warm. The owner even came up to our table and started speaking in Spanish to me (apparently she wanted me to try her desserts). \n\nSorry Ms. Owner Lady, despite having taken Spanish in high school, the extent of my espanol is \"Donde esta el bano\" and \"Yo quiero corona y patron\". \n\nThe two most important things to know when traveling in Mexico right?", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

(photo: http://bit.ly/12OPLQT) Well, that's what I get for waiting so long to try Gallardo's which is a nice, hearty stroll from my home in its current location across from Foods Co. After all, it's been around for only 53 years, clearly a fly-by-night operation. Jamie W. and I came here quite by accident when we were buying our 72-packs of toilet paper at Costco. After we started getting peckish waiting in the ridiculous line there, we walked over to the SoMa Streat Food Park just a little too early since none of the trailers were open. That's when I remembered Gallardo's as a place to get some morning menudo. The place is bustling on Saturday morning with a steady stream of regulars coming in and out of the two-room dining area (photo: http://bit.ly/15OdRhB).\n\nFor lack of options, we were seated at the largest round table in the middle of the floor. The desayunos (breakfast) menu is robust and comprehensive, much like it is at SanJalisco on South Van Ness and 20th (photo: http://bit.ly/11Mnxnx). But instead of colorful Mexican folk art decorating the walls, Gallardos offers what appears to be enlarged movie stills from Mexican cinema. I like it, just a bit of glam to go with your super-burrito. Jamie ordered the $8.25 Machaca Con Huevo, a very full plate of scrambled eggs mixed with shredded beef, onions, tomatoes and bell pepper with rice, refried beans and warm tortillas on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/12OPjls). Hearty eating and diner-ifically good. It's Saturday, so of course, it was the $9 grande bowl of Menudo for me.\n\nThe rich red broth came from a mix of roasted tomatoes pureed with dried chiles (photo: http://bit.ly/Z2hbOI), and there was a generous amounts of tripe and beef bones swimming inside. I sprinkled the cilantro, diced onion and dried oregano, and the result was definitely one of the better bowls of menudos in town (photo: http://bit.ly/183aUJk). Along with the warm tortillas, that should have been a complete meal, but I was so seduced by the lure of the $3 Puerco (Pork) Taco that I ordered one. What arrived was a meal in itself, a corn tortilla piled high with shredded carnitas, queso fresco, tomatoes and avocado slices (photo: http://bit.ly/11rw1zT). Whoa, that was a lot of food but the perfect way to laze on a weekend. Besides we had 72 rolls of toilet paper in the trunk, so we were good.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...great bowl of menudo, satisfying huevos make for hearty eats on the Mission/SoMa border\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...love the Mexican cinema photos all over the walls\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very kind and attentive as they buzz around the tables\nTOTAL - 4 stars...I'll follow them to 18th Street, I'm sure", "author": "Ed U."}

Never heard of it before but the reviews looked promising. My husband had the menudo and I had the birria. Both of which are only served on weekends. As a Mexican, I am picky when it comes to Mexican food. Also, I always compare it to my mom's and grandma's cooking. Unfair, I know. But I digress. Both soups came with cilantro, onions and limes. As well as oregano and pepper flakes for the menudo. The tortillas were handmade and were delicious. I had the birria al horno, which is just the meat and broth separate. The first spoonful of the broth was like heaven. It was hot and spicy and so full of flavor. I made a taco with the meat, added the onions and cilantro and dipped it in the broth before each bite. Man, was it yummy! I also tried the menudo and it was quite flavorful. The tripe was soft and easy to chew. I was bummed that it didn't have hominy though. I tried the orange-carrot fresh squeezed juice and it was really good. Interesting combo but it worked. My husband had a Mexican bottle coke which was room temp, so that was a bummer. \n\nThe service was bad though. It took a while for our waiter to take our order and only saw him once after he dropped off the food. Had to go up to the counter and ask for a to-go container and the check. I suppose if we had been in a rush I would have been more bothered but we weren't so it didn't matter that much. The line was out the door from the minute we got there to the time we left, so they must be doing something right. \n\nI will add though that I asked for more broth to go and the waitress was very happy to do so.

Sause wasn't spicy nor sweet :) our server was making my orange&carrot juice right before my eyes, which was so delicious. My bf had huevos rancheros, like the real thing tho. He usually eats slowly, but surprisingly he was done before me both of the times we been here. Service was right on point, coffee refills offered and not pushy on sales.

This place is overall amazing and now at the new location it made it even better! A modern twist with all the same fabulous familiar pictures covering the walls. It definitely attracts all types of cultures now too. Not just Latinos. ONLY reason why its still at a four  is b/c of the wait to get your bill at the end. It still only accepts cash too.

I was excited to stop in, not least because it stands where once was Chavas, a true powerhouse of soulful, family-style mexican food, and a restaurant to which the owner is connected.\n\nThe clientele is still bustling (long lines on the weekend), and the owner has done a nice job of cleaning up the appearance of the restaurant. \n\nSadly, neither I nor my lunch companions could find anything to recommend the actual dining experience:\n\nService, awkward. \nFood, bland. \nMeat, tough. \nIngredient quality, poor.\nPrices, astronomical. \n\nThis was not only disappointing, but a little surprising, given the high bar established by restaurants along the 18th Street corridor, and healthy competition for Mexican food even in the immediate vicinity. \n\nConsider these options:\n\nAt the same price point, there is Regalito Rosticeria a few blocks down 18th. Well-considered, authentic dishes with a modern touch and wonderful flavors, and warm efficient service.\n\nFor a quick, tasty meal, El Tepa has been doing a brisk trade for years on the same block as Gallardos.\n\nAnd for family-style, \"keeping-it-real\" food, there's San Jalisco and Los Yaquis a few blocks in either direction on S. Van Ness.\n\nI realize the restaurant is still working things out, and I will definitely give them a second chance in a few months, but so far the decisions I've witnessed look like a recipe for disaster (no pun intended). On the other hand, look at those lines...\n\nNote: The 140+ ratings you see are not for this location.", "author": "Jay B."}

It was a huge portion but I can't say that it was something I would keep getting. I did notice that they added a chile verde on top of it which contained pork. For those who care whether they are eating pork, it is risky for them to do that without warning you first.

My friends from Guadalajara say that this is the real thing.  Could serve the best breakfast in the city too.\n\nBeautiful new remodeled location.  Super clean and airy compared to the old dark location.  Old place was dingy, but this place is sparkling new.\n\nService is great.  If some fool complains that it is slow, it is because the place is so busy.  Today the place was so packed you had to wait for a seat, but I still got my food in less than 7 or 8 minutes.  Juan Gallardo gets to know his customers, super nice guy.  It is so obvious that he doesn't just see the place as a money making business, but he takes real pride in the product...the best Mexican food in San Francisco.  If there is a single thing wrong about your meal, he wants to hear about it.\n\nService quick, food served quick, huge menu, steaks, seafood, all the standard Mexican fare (but better), and Mexican stews and soups like Birria, Pozole, Menudo. If you like lamb, this birria is thick with it and delicious.\n\n\nBest omelettes in San Francisco too.  Sometimes I think they put four eggs in them.   The average breakfast there is so huge is is good for two (as are most of their dishes).  Great big glasses of fresh squeezed orange and carrot juice...delicious.  Can't beat the home made tortillas.\n\nGo.  Problem is, if you go there too often, you are gonna get fat.", "author": "Joe S."}

Gallardos was just around the corner from my mom's office and she swears by it and insisted on going there (even though all I wanted was some congee, so asian, I know). \n\nSo we went in, it was around 1 or 2 pm, so not a lot of people. The place is nice and clean, although I'm sure there are no street parking available during peak hours. Anyway once we sat down, we got complimentary tortilla chips together with some super hot salsa. It was good salsa but it's too hot for my taste, I wish they have a milder version. It wasnt so busy but it was very hard to get the attention of the waiters. I literally had to flag her down so that she can get our order. My mom had the pozole, I had the seafood enchiladas, my sister had the chicken enchilada, and my dad had the steak plate something (I forgot). Orders came in really fast (faster than our waitress getting our orders, heh!). The plates are big and everything was delicious. Since the food was so good, I decided to order dessert (it was my birthday after all). I ordered the flan.

Everything looked so delicious on the tables around me it was so difficult to decide. I ordered the pozole which they ended up running out of by the time we left at about 1 pm which goes to show you how popular it is! My husband could tell when we were eating that the owners were from the same town as him in Guadalajara, Mexico.  The food was identical to that which he grew up eating. Everything was wonderfully delicious. The pozole was flavorful and had accoutrements galore- fresh made tostadas, shredded cabbage, onions, cilantro, fresh juicy lime halves, chile flakes, and a large spoonful of crema on the side, my husband says you're suppose to spread that on the tostada. All of the other soups besides the pozole came with a little side plate of rice and guac, the rice was luscious, some of the best ever. My husband got chilaquiles and everything from the homemade tortillas to the silky yummy beans were fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better meal, my husband also got a mexican hot chocolate which was soo perfectly made. What was the icing on the cake though was the five star service.

The restaurant exudes a friendly and unpretentious ambiance, as most Mexican restaurants do, displaying an open prep area on the right hand side. Thought it strange that they sat the two of us at a table capable of sitting eight, all alone despite the line out the door--in fact, felt uncomfortable enough that when a party of five asked to move to a larger table near them I asked if we could relocate to their vacated table. This was an early indicator that the management suffers a few organizational obstacles in the running of their restaurant. The wait staff looked run off their feet, bringing me a Diet Coke instead of the coffee I ordered (huh?), and then taking a good while to remember the coffee. \n\nTHAT SAID: The food is very tasty. Fluffy tortillas tasted fresh. The flautas I ordered were crispy and not at all greasy, topped with a dollop or two of sour cream and queso and garnished with crispy lettuce. My girlfriend's dish was a standout, the caldo de pollo (chicken soup). Came with two meaty drumsticks, large chunks of carrot, zucchini, and a side dish of cilantro, onion and peppers to add in. Coffee was so-so. \n\nThat the restaurant is cash only (a fact I hadn't comprehended), was a small unpleasant surprise.

Since we were in \"The Mission\" I figured I would ask if this place was cash only. I thought it may not be since it is actually a sit-down kind of restaurant. The lady told me that Monday - Fridays they take credit and debit cards but on the weekends they usually try to keep it cash only. They were willing to make an exception for us but I went across the street to the grocery store to get some cash just in case. \n\nI really liked the feel of this restaurant.

In the meantime they brought us complementary guacamoWe were a little sad to find out that they didn't have \"aguas frescas\". They did have a nice selection of Jarritos, so the kids were happy. I ordered a michelada. They have a good selection of Mexican type beers. I asked for Negra Modelo in mine. Two of the kids ordered cheeseburgers, my sister and oldest nephew had the super carne asada burrito and I had the vegetarian burrito. In case you don't know (I didn't know until I was here and asked), making the burrito super means that you are adding guacamole and sour cream. \n\nThe burgers came with French fries just as they should at any respectable mexican restaurant. The kids loved it. They're still easy to please.\n\nThe burritos were HUGE. The beans had a good flavor, but it threw me off that they put lettuce all up in my tortilla. is that normal?my sister and nephew liked their carne asada burritos, those carnivores that they are. \n\nSo everything was good and the prices are really low considering it is a sit-down place. My burrito was about $5 and the carne asada burritos were like $6.50. \n\nBefore we left, my sister ordered fresh squeezed orange juice to go. so yeah, they don't have aguas frescas but they can make fresh squeezed orange juice. \n\ni think next time i would like to try the pozole or something else, although I probably won't be back unless I need to go to best buy and find myself in this part of town.", "author": "Daisy S."}

Yeah, that's a lot for one person, but I made it last for five meals. And all of this food cost about $36 with tax. Seriously, an incredible value. \n\nParking in that area isn't always easy but don't let that stop you. The food and the service are worth a visit, to eat in or to go. The server who helped me was really nice and she was quite efficient, covering half a dozen tables, the phone, and the cash register. Many more tables were open at 11am on a Tuesday but when they get busy, having that much room is probably very helpful for a lot of hungry people.\n\nAlthough some of the other items have gotten more hype, the nopalitos were the best of the group. The breakfast dish of eggs, prickly pear cactus, and peppers really hit the spot for me, and contained a more robust and tangy flavor than I anticipated. If this is what a weekday breakfast item tastes like then who knows how good the weekend specials would be.\n\nThe pozole was as excellent as described. Huge portions - the larger size is a quart - with huge chunks of tender pork. \n\nThe carne asada was higher quality than I'd expected, in that two small steaks were served whole with 7/8th cuts in them. Definitely tender enough to break apart easily and eat with the veggies provided with a tortilla.\n\nThe hamburguesa con queso was ground and hand formed with plenty of cheese. It was a fair to good burger but the value is very high. Given the number of cheeseburgers I've eaten in SF, this truly was an excellent value. I recall a price of $4 but that seems low. Even at $6 it would be a great deal, because an order of fries is included.", "author": "Mike H."}

The portions are huge and the entrees are cheap. Also, I recommend the guacamole to start - delicious!

Although I really wanted some breakfast tacos, a quick scan of the Gallardos menu told me that napalitos con huevos (cactus with eggs) would satisfy my appetite.  The cactus here is marinated in vinegar and has a supple texture without being too soft (like one finds at most places that serve cactus).  Tomatoes used here have a slightly sour taste that complements the vinegar from the cactus.  Served with a generous portion of eggs, sauteed onions, a satisfying spicy salsa, and homemade tortillas, this meal makes for a hearty quick breakfast.  Be sure not to miss the freshly squeezed orange juice; you know its fresh because there is a huge pile of oranges behind the glass wall and you can watch the staff make your juice.

I work very near Nopalito, and their $12 pozole tastes like dishwater in comparison to Gallardos'.     The albondigas is outstanding as well. \nThe egg dishes I've had have all been pleasing as well.   The odd little portion of chile verde on the side of your eggs is an odd but not undesirable touch.  \nThey give so many tortillas with your meal it is insane.  Easily 2 pounds of fresh tortillas for 2 people.   Take them home and put some butter and salt, or butter and cinnamon and sugar.   They will give you butter at the restaurant if you want some that way there.  \n\nTo the Roach lady.  Just stay home.  You are never 100% free of roaches in city restaurants.  It's a city.  These are old buildings.  And don't ever travel to south east asia if you think you saw a big cockroach at Gallardos you'll be in for a treat. \n\nTo the \"taco truck taco\" guy.   WTF?  a 1 star review because you didn't like the item you made up that wasn't on their menu?    It's not hard to figure out what's popular at this place.  You can read recommendations here, or you can just look at every other table.  Notice there is soup on EVERY table?  \n\nHunger is making me grumpy.  i wish there was something even close to Gallardos in the sunset/richmond.", "author": "howard t."}

I was looking for a taqueria on a hung over Sunday morning (ok... it was more like Sunday afternoon) I stumbled upon this place.   Being only a few blocks away from my place, my girlfriend and I decided to check it out.  I was at first surprised that this wasnt a take out Mexican place like I've been accustomed to in the Mission.  This is a sit down restaurant that families tend to come to have lunch.  We decided to try it out anyway and were blown away.  The quality of the food, portion size, and price were just really outstanding.   We've been back since and everything I've tried has been fantastic.  The carnitas are really fantastic, as is the chile verde plate.  For around $9 you get a huge plate of meat, rice, veggies, and possibly the best refried beans I've ever had.  On top of all that you get a grilled pepper to top off the dish.    \n\nIf you're looking for a change from the normal taqueria or just a sit down Mexican place for lunch, you really have to try this place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-01-05", "description": "This place is fantastic. It really is cheap and they prepare very tasty food that sure seems authentic to me. When I was in there today, for the first time, my friend and I were the only gringas in the place, the only people not speaking Spanish so I guess some Latinos in the area think it is tasty and, maybe, authentic-tasting Mexican food.  That seems to speak well of the place -- at least to me. \n\nI 'just' got huevos rancheros.  IMHO, the simple dish of huevos rancheros reveals how well the chef understands eggs, frijoles, rice and tortillas. I often order this item as my first time in a Mexican restaurant. Testing such a simple 'classic' is a good test, at least I think so.\n\nWe split a side order of chorizo with scrambled eggs cause they don't sell just the chorizo/sausage but the waitress had the kitchen hold back the additional rice & beans and talked us out of ordering two orders of chorizo -- which we really wanted to do, imagining we would get sausage links but, nope, they only sell diced chorizos scrambled perfectly and sublimely. And the waitress insisted we not order two 'sides' of chorizo, she said with our two orders of huevos rancheros, it would just be way too much food.  I balked, tried to insist we were up for lots of chorizo and she insisted we just get the one order and see what it looked like. She was right. I had so much food that I was unable to eat all of it.\n\nWith two entrees, coffee and that side order of chorizo scrambled with eggs, the bill came to $22.75. The huevos rancheros -- sublimely perfect -- are $6.75. \n\nMy idea of good huevos rancheros:  runny, creamy, frijoles -- not beans but mushed up twice cooked gooey frijoles, a good tortilla under the two sunny-side-up eggs. Then mix the runny egg yolks with the perfect frijoles, scoop & dip with the stack of very good side tortillas.  It's an awesome comfort food, IMHO. Soothing, simple and awesomely delicious. We also mushed in the chorizo & scrambled eggs, but left about half the chorizo/egg on the plate. We could not eat everything we had.  \n\nI'll be back, even tho I don't have a car and it is a longish walk from 16th St BART", "author": "Shaniqua A."}

Several of my favorites have closed--I still mourn Casa Agilas way out in the Sunset.  So for a couple of years I've been looking for a new place and this may be it.  It's awfully inconspicuous--hard to spot even, as you drive down Folsom.  And when you approach the door, the impression is of a small dumpy place.  But the inside will amaze you--it's quite large and pleasant.\n\nThe usual chips and salsa offered to start are good--the salsa had some serious heat.  I had a combo plate with a chile relleno and a pork enchillada.  The menu seems to indicate if you order 2 pork enchilladas by themselves, they will come with green sauce, but mine (with the chile relleno) had a red sauce, a slight disappointment.  I'm sure if I had though to request green they woud have happily provided it.  Anyway,  the enchilada was very tasty,  The chile was also but regretably they covered it up with a pile of chopped iceberg lettuce I had to push aside.  I really wish Mexican places would abandon this habit of putting piles of undressed lettuce and maybe a tomato slice on the plate--who ever eats it?\n\nI asked for iced tea but what came was raspberry flavored tea--not what I expected but very tasty (I drank 2 glasses).  Finally, I was seriously thinking about some desert and hoping they had flan, but my very sweet waitress didn't ask about desert--she just brought my check and I abandoned the idea.\n\nAll in all, very satisfying.  A few quirks to get used to, but satisfying and a good place to know about.  On this Saturday evening they were practically empty, though--just one other occupied table while I was there--so I hope more people try it and keep them in business.", "author": "B. T."}

Sure, there are plenty of good taco trucks, but for other traditional fare? I am often disappointed by lackluster meals which utilize cheese as its main component. While I still haven't discovered the best home style Mexican restaurant in my hood, at least I can say that I've found one in SF. \n\nGallardos comes amazingly correct with its food, especially the soups, and specifically the posole. Right after my best friend's mom's home cooked version, this is the best. The pork is tender and immense in flavor, elevating the soup to the next level. Even as I got full, I just could not stop consuming the posole. It is borderline addictive.\n\nServed with both tostadas and warm tortillas, tons of seasoning/onions/cilantro for you to add as you please, it's really one of my favorite meals at this point.\n\nNext time I'm in the area, I'd like to try the menudo, which again is difficult to find a good version of at restaurants. But the posole is just that good, that I continue to order it each time I make my way over there. Some habits are hard to break, I guess.\n\nWhile some people leave their hearts in San Francisco, I've definitely left mine in an empty soup bowl at Gallardos.", "author": "Karen T."}

On the menu it's crispy tacos but I requested plain ol' street tacos.  Meat, cilantro, onions, sauce on a tortilla.  One carne asada and one pork.  \nMan, what a disappointment!  The tacos came \"super\" which means lettuce, cheese, guacamole and sauce.  The carne asada wasn't grilled like these pictures.  It was like stewed or something and very tough.  The pork was worse.  It was tougher and seemed like it was cooked the day before.  Long story short, I didn't even finish the plate.  The rice and beans were decent but I didn't come for rice and beans.  The fresh squeezed orange juice was served at room temperature with no ice.  The waitress was nice but the food was awful.  For you \"don't knows\" there's waaaay better places in the area.

I biked through 14th & Folsom every day and never even noticed there was a restaurant here.  But when you do go inside, you find a surprisingly large space decorated mostly with pictures from the Mexican silver screen (not too shabby).  I don't know of any \"signature\" dish here, but they did have a nopalitos con huevos burrito, and I've been meaning to try something with cactus for a long time, so I got it.  It was huge, but amazingly, it was gone before I knew it and I didn't even feel that stuffed, but when something's tasty and vegetarian, what do you expect?  In short, not a destination dive but a rock-solid option if you're in this (rather food-sparse) part of town.", "author": "Wes M."}

Also they do not have horchata, wtf? Aside from those two things this place serves up some serious Mexican comfort food. For appetizer we started with the Frijoles con queso, a yummy gooey platter of re fried beans with a ton of melted cheese, guac and grilled jalapenos. Gooey goodness! I had combo #5 a tostada and enchilada and the hubby combo #2 green sauce enchiladas. OMG more piled high goodness. The tostada was off the hook with meat, beans, guac and salsa. The hubby enjoyed the green sauce enchiladas so much he didn't want to share, lol! As others have mentioned the handmade corn tortillas are something special, large and tasty. I would return to this place again, I would love to try the soups. The service was nice and quick too. \nP.S. The chips and salsa are just ok, the salsa is on the spicy side. \nP.S.S. I love, love the Mexican movie star posters on all the walls. The gorgeous Maria Felix is always a wonderful site to see.", "author": "La C."}

I ate here for the first time a few weeks ago and don't have a single bad thing to say about the place: our waitress was funny and super nice and seemed sincere in her kindness and patience, the food rocked! and came in enormous portions and is very inexpensive along with the extensive menu (including loads of veggie options and a brunch). \n\nRegarding \"going the extra mile\"...Six of us showed up at 6:59 on a Thursday and had no clue they were actually about to close (at 7pm). They basically reopened the kitchen, turned on the music (my first clue) and brought us not just chips and dip to start but some crazy yummy bean and avocado appetizer (that we were not charged for). There was no rush, no irritation on their part for this big group barging in right before closing; we didn't get wind that they were actually closing until we noticed their hours posted in the corner of the window. Feeling horrible for being so unobservant, we apologized to our waitress and thanked them for staying open and told them we will definitely be back as regulars - their brunch menu was looking darn good too.", "author": "Julie J."}

The huevos rancheros and chilaquiles were wonderful. Strongly recommend having some Mexican hot chocolate (chocolate abuelita). One of the managers came over after our meal to see how everything was and he took his time and was genuinely interested in our feedback. During our breakfast a man playing the guitar came in and sang. It couldn't have been a more authentic Mexican experience if we'd been in Mexico! Don't judge a book by its cover- try it and you won't regret it.", "author": "Marianne C."}

Their portions are big and fair. It is just absolutely delicious. The have fresh orange and carrot juice. You can mix them per request. They do not take credit cards at this moment, because their machine is broken. Most of the staff speaks broken English, but it is so worth it.", "author": "Angela Y."}

I haven't found anything that came close until breakfast this morning at Gallardos. I stumbled in after finding it on mobile.yelp.com (woo hoo!) and was so excited. My huevos rancheros were delicious, the tortillas were wonderful, and the carrot juice- yum. Musicians serenaded us as I ate my amazing breakfast. I cannot wait to return for dinner.", "author": "Noelle Q."}

I keep telling me myself next time I come here I'll order something else but it's sooo good that I end up getting the large albondigas soup again.\n\nLarge chunks of carrots, potatoes, and celery makes perfect companions for the large meatballs.  The broth is light yet very savory.  I like to add huge spoonfuls of parsley and onions to finish out the soup.", "author": "mellow p."}

I continue to give them my business after many failed attempts of theirs to make me happy. I usually get the super chicken burrito and say however many times they request, that I do not want rice in it. It is a 50/50 chance my burrito will actually come without rice. Today the odds were not in my favor. I called and requested my order again which was very difficult for them to understand. I went to pick up my new burrito and the lady asked me where my old burrito was? I asked her if she really wanted me to go home and retrieve my burrito and she did. Did she think I was trying to scam them? Was she gonna reuse the chicken? I grabbed it and presented it unwrapped and 1/5th eaten in exchange for my 2nd burrito. It was still mediocre as usual and I can't stand the two handfuls of big pieces of lettuce they include. I am sad to say I continue to try my hardest to never have to eat here. I miss San Diego's Mexican food :(", "author": "Jessica Y."}

You feel like you're in Mexico City, at some restaurant that caters to middle-class Mexicans.\n\nThe food just misses.\n\nThe salsa is a little too tame, the chips a little too greasy.\n\nThe chicken in the chicken enchiladas is EXCELLENT!!! If only the tortillas surrounding the chicken weren't so greasy (my Mexican grandmother would have told them that the oil they cooked them in wasn't hot enough). And I like cheese as much as the next guy, but they smother the enchiladas, beans and salad (with 1000 island dressing) with it, topped with sour cream. All these toppings don't do justice to the excellent chicken, rice and beans underneath.\n\nListen up, people! Mexicans use cheese sparingly, if at all, and even less cream! This place uses cheese & cream like some bad Italian restaurant in 1980s Ohio! \n\nThe daily special I had yesterday was \"pollo con verdudas\". \"Muy rico\" said the waitress. Well, it was my gringa mom's DULL chicken stew with carrots, potatoes and celery, not a hint of herbs, spices, peppers or tomato.\n\nTortillas are probably regional, but for me I found them a little too course and heavy.\n\nThe service is friendly, fast & efficient considering one waitress has to serve 2 huge rooms.", "author": "John G."}
