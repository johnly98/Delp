There's nothing extravagant or hipster about Pasquales--it's just an overall good pizza. We always order the cheese pizza and the mushroom, salami, and garlic pizza.

Soggy pasta.  Probably less than decent quality meats as they certainly seem chewy enough at times.  Bread that is worthless as a parsley sprig on a plate.\n\nTo top it off, it is not as if the in-house experience makes up for any of it.  All you can hear is the sound of the machines and the general hum of other people eating.  It is actually depressing.  I have no idea how employees make it through their shifts.\n\nYou can count on bland food and too-much of it.  Terrible, no, but it is pretty much just a meal.", "author": "Chris D."}

It has Alfredo sauce, chicken, bacon, and green onions. It tastes like the pizza version of a Costco chicken bake, which also tastes amazing. My friends who don't like the chicken bake even like this pizza.\n\nThe only thing I've ordered from this place that kind of disappointed me was their fried calamari. It had absolutely 0 seasoning. I don't know if my order was a mistake or that's how it normally tastes. Even just adding salt would be better.", "author": "Bowen W."}

It was pretty good! 5/5\nChicken Special - I thought chicken was too dry and flavorless. My least favorite pizza 1/5 \nBeef Mexicali - there were lots of beef and jalape\u00f1o. If you love jalape\u00f1o, order this! If you don't, skip this! 3/5\n\nI always pass this place by and finally got to try this place! Overall it was okay! Pizza crust was thinner than I thought! I prefer thin crust so it was great. Service was mediocre. My favorite out of all was Seafood pizza!

I grew up in Manhattan in New York City & have had my share of pizza since childhood.  The crust, the cheese, the sausage, the pepperoni are all on point (did not do the anchovies if that is on the menu because, as a kid, no one did the anchovies).  So why to 3 Stars?  The price point is high for pizza and the staff could be both nicer and more efficient.  The hardware is not exactly table cloth either.  If I come back (I will, infrequently, but I will) I will optimize for the price to pie size to number of people in the party ratio and have to ignore the quality of the staff.", "author": "Leung T."}

While waiting for our pizza, we had the chance to meet the owner who shared with us a bit of  their story. Open since the late 50's, Pasquale pizzeria represents a real institution in the neighborhood,  a lot of returning customers literally grown up with their delicious pizza. Still now, the place is frequented mostly by neighbors ,many of them families, and the staff seem to know all them.  The pizza itself is very light and crispy, toppings are generous and prices are more than reasonable, almost unbelievable for the quality and the quantity that you are actually buying. I'm also always very pleased by the relaxed, friendly and informal atmosphere of a classic mom and pop restaurant.

We used to go to both locations back in the day--the Sloat location was usually less crowded, and you could get food more quickly--but at some point the service at Sloat got sloppy and their pizzas went downhill. From then on, we only went to Irving.\n\nI love the House Special at Pasquale's; my wife is a fan of the pineapple-and-onion combo, which has also won me over. I've had the takeout phone number memorized since I left for college, when on trips home I would call from the airport so that pizza would be ready for pickup by the time I got into the city.\n\nI've taken out-of-town friends here, partly for the pizza, partly for the ambience. I lived in New York for two years and loved the pizza there, but there's just something about Pasquale's. Some of it involves ingredients: the crust and juiciness of the pizzas, the huge family-style pastas, the pretty good house wines. But it's also the atmosphere: the smell of Italian goodness even when you're standing outside, the hustle and bustle, and the great neighborhood, surrounded by bars and the park and coffee shops. It's a good, old-fashioned Italian pizza place amid a city of brand-new, shiny, character-less restaurants that seem to try too hard. That character here helps overcome sometimes verrrrrrrrry slow service.\n\nThe pizza is at its best when it's steaming hot (although it's also pretty good cold the next day). It's also a great place to go for birthday parties  and other events (my family has done its holiday party here on a couple of occasions). It's not too expensive, and you get a ton of pasta when you order family style. You can also order food to take over to Yancy's pub down the block to watch sports!", "author": "Matt C."}

My coworker was raving to me about how good it was, and I thought okay fine it's her turn to choose a place to eat. We got here and there was actually no one waiting in line to be seated. It took 5 minutes for us to seated. No one acknowledged us. Finally, we got seated and it took fifteen minutes to finally place an order. I don't get it. I had to get the attention of a girl and she said someone will be right with us. As if she hasn't been going to all the tables around us. \n\nMy coworker and I were pretty hungry, so we both ordered an entree, shared an appetizer, and did half half on a small pizza. The plates came out one at a time which was really annoying. We didn't get our bread and butter until we got the pizza. By then, I was super pissed. The popcorn shrimp we ordered was just okay. The dish came with cocktail sauce, and it didn't pair really well with the shrimp. My cheese ravioli with pesto was pretty good but I didn't finish it. The pizza, since we split half half, we got charged for each different topping. The small pizza ended up being around $25. The pizza I got Parma, which I did enjoy because there wasn't any tomato sauce. However, it was so salty. The other reviewers are right. I had to drink so much freaking water. \n\nThe experience couldn't get any worse until we had to wait 15 minutes for our waiter to come give us our check. Although he was really nice, it seemed like he was a busboy and not really a waiter. Which leads me to say, why wouldn't the other waiters help us? They went to ALL surrounding tables except for ours. It's safe to say, I will never be back to Pasquale's.", "author": "Jeanne C."}

I work late on some days in the week so when I decide to come here for a late dinner, I usually get the small Asian as my waitress. I give props to anyone who can wait a table past 10pm with a glowing smile and personality! Also, I love the warm bread with butter and parmesan that gets served to every table. Classy touch. \n\nFOOD: Their smallest pizza can still feed two people generously. They have a bunch of interesting combinations but what I was most impressed with was the flavor behind their vegetarian options. I have been to more reputable Italian restaurants before with lack-luster veggie pizza options. Lately, however, I've been most interested in their pasta selections. If it's your first time here, I'd recommend the chicken and mushroom penne. When they say \"mushroom marinara\", it's not marinara with mushrooms sprinkled in. You can really detect the fungal aromas in the sauce. I also just realized how unappetizing that sounds but I'm too far along to press the 'backspace' on my keyboard now. Moving on! \n\nATMOSPHERE: Meh. The tables have plastic covers on them, the carpet is dirty, and the atmosphere is...well....as you'd expect a late-night joint to be. With that being said, you can witness the pizza magic happening the moment you walk through the door and see all the fresh ingredients being put into your pie so that's comforting!

Absolutely terrible rude and disgusting. I ordered two pizzas, both to the hospital about 10 mins away from the pizza parlor and both came hard as cardboard and cold as ice. I have two sick kids here and they asked for pizza, as a young kid myself I used to love this place. The owner is not a business man, he's an absolute garbage cat hustling innocent people from their money. I encourage everyone who reads this avoid the pizza at all costs. Avoid giving this scum bucket your money as they are here specifically to screw you over. When I called to complain and ask for something to be remedied he asked me questions condescendingly as if I was lying. I said barely any sausage on my pizza and this guy has the gall to ask me if I counted the number of sausages on my pie. Are you kidding me? As a business man you suck, as human you suck even more. He told me I should have called right away but with young kids hungry as hell what am I to do keep them hungry until the guy feels like making me another pizza. Total garbage cat two bit hustler. It'll be the last dime you get from me and I guarantee from the large chamber I belong to. Good luck slinging your trash pizza. If your service was even remotely courteous I'd be a bit more forgiving but your customer service is awful just like your establishment and just like your pizza.

I am born and raised in San Francisco also my family owns restaurants multiple ones in San Rafael and in the city I've bartended and been a waitress in all of them before I had children and decided to stay home for the past couple years. Place is your regular neighborhood Italian joint nothing special every time we order a pizza we get basil and at least 50% of the time - and I'm not exaggerating they forget the basil. When you order a vegetarian pizza that's the most important part. Plus I've ordered pasta and they put the wrong sauce - when I asked for the white wine sauce they put the red sauce for some reason whoever answers the phone doesn't seem to hear very well. Anyways call the restaurant to let them know they've forgotten the basil multiple times because I didn't call the first couple times having being in the business I know mistakes happen. The woman who answers the phone puts me on hold multiple times tells me she'll give me a creditFor three toppings next time I order for having forgotten the basil multiple times. I said well they should just give me a free pizza then- she said hold on I'll talk to my boss... Comes back on the phone and asks if they can just  send the basil out I say sure send out the basil and then she proceeds to and hangs up in my face...I'm sorry I pissed you off because you forgot to put the topping on my pizza. Not to mention it's a double charge for basil for which I haven't complained that you forgot it numerous times ...Only for you guys to be nasty and rude and hang up in my face!! Customer service is questionable there and now I'm scared to get the basil they probably spit in it!

OK, nobody talk-a like dat to us at Pasquale's, but it's the kind of old-school, plastic-tablecloth place where you'd expect someone in a Chef Boyardee outfit to come out and talk like that (photo: http://bit.ly/1jhX7qa). Well, at least the waitress was friendly and attentive, a far cry from the indifference we experienced across the street at the equally old-school Villa Romana. In fact, she sat us at the \"special\" table under the florescent blacklight so that our plastic water glasses would glow in an iridescent purplish pink (photo: http://bit.ly/1oSc29Y). Jamie W. and I have noticed this place for years as we peered out of the N-Judah, so this was the Friday night where we would give it a shot.\n\nWhether Chef Boyardee tosses the dough in the air with one hand or not, we knew we were getting a pizza, but I was thinking we could share a $5.50 half-order of the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce. It was definitely on the ho-hum side. I mean, look at it (photo: http://bit.ly/QLNAe7). Doesn't it look like it came out of a jar? Yeah, I think so, too, even when you apply an aggressive shake of the dry Parmesan cheese on top. Yeah, I knew I should have ordered the Antipasto Salad for a little more variety on our palates. Luckily, the pizza didn't disappoint nearly as much. we settled on the $21.50 16\" House Special with sausage, pepperoni, mushrooms, and salami (photo: http://bit.ly/1jwGIs3). We figured if we were kickin' it old-school, we'd kick it over the curb.\n\nIt was a pretty satisfying pie, and they certainly didn't skimp on the toppings which were piled high on the melted cheese. The crust was the thin, cracker-like kind, not my favorite since it buckles under the pressure of excessive toppings. But it was still good enough for us to devour 2/3 of it right there. The rest of it went home with Jamie in a box with a cartoon...oh, there's Pasquale (photo: http://bit.ly/1nR1V58) Hey paisan!  Anyhow, I'm not the type who pooh-poohs a place like this in favor of the designer pizzerias that offer fig and prosciutto on their fashion-forward pizzas. OK, I am that type, but I still like the old-school pizza that reminds me of college all-nighters. I could have used a glow-in-the-dark glass back then.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...generic spaghetti but the nostalgic pizza saves the evening\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...familiar old-time pizza place that'll give fellow baby boomers flashbacks\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...speedy and pretty attentive throughout\nTOTAL - 3 stars...worth a trip in the wayback machine if you're in the mood for good dorm-room pizza", "author": "Ed U."}

After sitting down for 10+ minutes we still hadn't received a menu but noticed a table of four that had arrived after us was already receiving drinks. We waited some more but our waitress (middle-aged, short, Filipina female) still did not arrive - evidently she'd forgotten us. We contemplated leaving the restaurant but decided to ride it out. After 15+minutes we finally were able to flag her down, and there was no apology and in fact she suddenly attempted to rush our order. As no wine menu had been brought we requested her to bring one. We also had to request bread to be brought to the table and water was never refilled. She never asked how our food was. Also my food was brought out over 5 minutes before my friends and dish was cold by the time my friend's entree arrived. But all these are small details. The worst part of the meal was not just the service but the attitude of the server herself. Her rudeness and passive aggressive verbal jabs made towards us at the middle and end of our meal were  surprising to say the least and *not* at all classy!

It's not a trendy, gourmet or avant garde hotspot. It's just Italian American home cooking.  It comes to your table with good, polite, conscientious service.  But what really kicks this from 3 to 4 stars is that Pasquale's food is pleasantly affordable.\n\nAfter having gone here inconsistently for years, last night my family ordered cheese ravioli with marinara, baked ziti and 3 personal pizzas for the kids. We also started out with some pesto garlic bread. All of the above was just good, solid food. The kids devoured the pizzas. My ravioli was plentiful and filling. Really, nothing remarkable, but absolutely nothing bad to say.  I was only able to finish half, and as I type this I am eating the left overs for breakfast. The ziti is advertised as \"East Coast\", which is funny because my wife was asking if I knew much about baked ziti and I explained that it's difficult to find a good rendition of the dish out West after having grown up on the stuff in NYC. Even so, I thought the ziti was good. It was cooked perfectly, and I really like their ricotta. My only complaint was that the dish was perhaps a bit watery, maybe from the marinara? The only drink of consequence was a glass of cheap chianti. The restaurant was a bit warm, and so was the wine.\n\nWhen we were done eating, my wife and I wondered why we don't come to Pasquale's regularly as we have lived just a few blocks away for years.  We love Italian food and it's not as though every Italian dinner on a night out with the family has to be SPQR or Delfina.\n\nWe will definitely make this a more regular go-to spot for our family neighborhood walks.", "author": "Jason G."}

I have gone to many other restaurants, including extremely high end and even the fabled Woodlake Joes, and not found it.  What I was served was usually tasty, but definitely not baked.  Pasquale's knows how to use the oven to bring out that unique flavor.  Highly recommended.\n\nWith regards to the service.  Initial seating was casual with menus dropped off.  We were given time to look everything over and then the fun happened once we started ordering.  The server was most engaging and appropriately attentive and helpful.  We had ordered the calamari appetizer and when he noticed I put the left over squeezed lemon in my water, he went and cut up a lemon to provide wedges for my wife to use also!  Wow, that was truly appreciated.  The server (he has worked there 15 years) also recommended a great red wine to try instead of the Chianti, Tampino/Taurasi? (sorry, I cannot remember).  I will order that wine again in a heartbeat.  Through out the meal the service provided was pretty much on point: attentive, convivial, helpful, and not over bearing or intrusive.  We were not rushed and made to feel welcome.  If you are a person that wants to rush, well maybe the pace here will be too relaxed for you, but we appreciated it as we were looking to relax and celebrate.\n\nWe used to frequent Villa Romano while it was owned and operated by the father (and the uncle cooked);  but when the son took over it was never the same and closed fairly quick.  Now we have a place worth driving up from the peninsula to eat.  We will be coming back, and we haven't even tried the pizza yet (which lots of folks rave about).\n\nBy the way, the person that turned me on to Pasquale's loves their Frutti di Mare, I haven't tried it yet but that could be in my future.\n\np.s., the menu on Yelp is accurate in selection from what I remember, but the prices have increased by 2-3 dollars on most items, still a great deal in my book for what you get.", "author": "R W."}

I almost always get the same items for delivery or to go. I LOVE their pizza, although I always order thin crust with mushrooms and eggplant - personal or small size. I'm really surprised by people who say that their crust tastes like cardboard, as that's not at all my experience. Also, I've never been overcharged by them, i.e., had a discrepancy between their menu price on paper or online and what I've been billed. Their direct delivery is free and generally very efficient. The other thing I always order is their dinner salad, which is large, fresh, with a nice assortment of veggies and some beans. I'm not totally surprised, although still disappointed, about the complaints regarding rude, poor in-dining service. Since most of the people at the cashier and the guys who make the pizza know my face, I've never had any problems when I go in person and order my regular items to go. My only issue really is that they always seem to miss or mess up something with my delivery orders. Not big things, but things such as not including extra Parmesan cheese, putting dressing on the salad and not on the side, and very infrequently under or overcooking the pizza. I did recently go outside the box and order their roasted chicken entree with two sides, which was very good.", "author": "Chelsea D."}

Even though the place was moderately busy (3 PM on a weekday) the service was on the slow side. My water glass was empty before I got the attention of the waiter to fill it. The waiter was courteous and pleasant but kind of busy, for serving us properly, when we needed something. \n\nThe prices were higher than what I have seen on menupages.com or anywhere on the net. An Italian restaurant competitor who has been just across the street for sixty years folded ten days ago and I assume that prices were increased at Pasquales's shortly after the demise of Villa Romana. Economics is what it is and I do not blame them for the price increase.\n\nMy wife's request was botched, but it was an honest mistake. She asked for Calamari with the tartar sauce on the side. It was put on the bread instead. The mistake was fixed but when the sandwich was reheated, the fries were fried or cooked a second time, so she had well done fries. As she put it, \"double fried fries.\" She was unhappy about that.\n\nMy wife did not think that her calamari was very good. It had tartar instead of marinara sauce. Two stars. \n\nAs for my chicken parmigiana; I guess I am a New Yorker spoiled by great Italian food in my hometown of Brooklyn.  This did not measure up to what I am accustomed to having in an Italian restaurant. The parts of the sandwich were there but they did not add up to a good sandwich. There was no blend, it tasted as if I had the separate parts but no chicken parmigiana taste. I took the cheese and tomato sauce from a slice of pizza and put it in the sandwich to make it a kind of pizza sandwich with chicken but it still did not have a good taste. I will not order this sandwich again, it is too much of a disappointment. Maybe two stars. Maybe less.\n\nWe both had French fries with our orders. It looked like these fries were from the bottom of the bag. Little nubs with very few long ones. Their taste was below average and my wife said that McDonald's has better fries. One star.\n\nWe also ordered a 16 inch pizza. I liked the taste of the crust. It had a good flavor to it. It was a bit thicker than I like though. The rest of the pizza (cheese and tomato sauce) would get three stars. In NY it would get two stars but I understand that I am not in Brooklyn.  \n\nAppreciate that this place takes credit cards (but not Discover). So many places do not take them.\n\nAlso, no music at all was playing. I guess that is better than having to hear Frank Sinatra in an Italian restaurant. \n\nNo Television. I do not like TV anyway. \n\nBathrooms were clean, that is good.", "author": "Steven G."}

I work as a mechanic, so naturally my hands get dirty. I finally was able to order lunch since I was hungry and when I got my food there was no utensils, no fuckin fork!! I would understand if they made a mistake but they said condescendingly that I did not request utensils. How the fuck am I going to eat?! With my hands, salad and pasta? They said they are not going to send a delivery guy out just for that, and so I asked to speak to the manager. I kept playing phone tag with them because they kept saying the manager was busy. Finally I got to speak to the manager and he was not apologetic at all. He said if they have time, a delivery guy will come out to drop off the fork. What fuckin restaurant doesn't give you a fork? Pasquale's has to understand that some people order from their work and there is no fork or utensils available. They should include that. What are they that cheap to not put a dam plastic fork inside?! Even Chinese restaurants provide chopsticks and forks without you even asking. Fuck this place. They are insensitive and rude as fuck. \nGo to Paxie's pizza on Irving. They blow this shit hole out of the water. I was a paying customer of Pasquale's for awhile now, but when they pulled this shit on me over a dam fork, I'm good. They are petty and can't see how other customers feel.

I really enjoy their thin crust, but if they don't bake it long enough the middle of the pizza is still a bit soft/soggy (this is usually the case when we eat at the restaurant). I like to eat my pizza on a plate, but for those who don't, your pizza might sag while you eat because the crust hasn't had time to crisp up. \n\nWhen dining at Pasquale's, we usually order about 3 XL pies for 12-15 people (majority of them are guys, and me the only girl in the bunch). Maybe the crust is still soft because they're trying to get our food to us as fast as possible, which is nice but I'd rather have a solid crust. When we do pick-up, we usually order an XL and it's usually enough to feed 4-5 people. I think an extra large with three toppings (sausage, mushroom, and pepperoni) comes out to be $21 and some change. \n\nService at Pasquale's is nice and attentive, but we're usually the only table/big group there so it'd be hard to ignore us. Servers are great with bringing any sauces we request, and refill our water pitchers frequently enough. \n\nPasquale's pizzas aren't ground-breaking or the best of the best, but it's a solid pizza joint with great prices.

The crust is not sweetened, stuffed or anything else.  It has usually been thickish, bready and delicious.  The last three years or so, the crust has gotten thiner, either to compete with changing tastes or because of the price of wheat rising.  In any event, it  matters little, it's a great crust.  We also are big fans of the antipasta salad--It's enough for 4 people and has a lot of great stuff.\n\nThe reason for taking off one star is that we've eaten at the restaurant and tried the italian dishes.

Up until this point, they've always been my favorite pizza in the city. I work in the park and go there frequently, and have had many delivery orders from them in the past with no problems.\n\nTonight I placed an order for delivery and was told it would take up to an hour and a half. I told them that was fine and placed my order. I gave them my address and my card info and was told it was good to go. I found it odd that the woman didn't ask for my phone number, but figured they know what they're doing.\n\nAn hour and 45minutes later, I still hadn't received my pizza and called to check on it. And honestly, as someone that works in customer service, I'm very understanding of errors and wasn't calling to yell at anyone. I was then told by the guy on the phone that the pizza delivery was attempted but that no one answered the door and that they must have had the wrong address. He then said that they were supposed to take my phone number down but didn't, and apologized. He took down my phone number. I was then also told that my card hadn't gone through. I asked them why they didn't tell me this when I placed the order, because the woman had told me it was \"good to go.\" I was then told to wait and that I would speak to the boss. The second the boss got on the phone, he immediately started saying that he didn't believe that I had really ordered pizza, and that no one answered the door. I told him that this wasn't possible, I had been waiting for it and looking out the window/purposely listening for cars. I also asked him why no one told me that the card didn't go through, as I could've just fixed that problem then, or known to have cash ready. It ended with him hanging up on me. I called back and he answered again and I calmly told him that he was being very rude, and wasn't even letting me explain anything. He ended this call with a \"Ok, we won't be delivering it\" and again, hung up on me. \n\nAt this point I figured I'd eat somewhere else, as he had told me it wasn't coming anymore, and I had been yelled at and hung up on twice by this man, who is apparently the manager of the restaurant. I was very upset at this point, and felt that as a manager he didn't even bother to let me finish one sentence while I spoke to him. About 10 minutes after the phone call, I received a call from a different phone number, and it was a pizza guy saying that he was outside. He then saw me come down from my staircase and realized that he had been knocking on our garage door, which was why I never heard him. He also must've parked down the street, because I never heard or saw a car. At this point, I didn't have enough cash for the pizza and was visibly upset because of how frustrated I was. Ultimately, the pizza guy told me that it wasn't my fault, and let me keep my drink for free since I only had cash to cover the pizza. \n\nIt was an incredibly unpleasant experience. I'm not sure if I'll order from them ever again. Which is heartbreaking, because their pizza truly is the best. I'd highly recommend eating at their actual spot if you're in the neighborhood, but sadly I can't recommend ordering for delivery from here on out.", "author": "Amanda B."}

Pizza is always good and fresh although the counter service and wait can be so-so. The other night was my first time sitting down to eat here and I was more than underwhelmed.\n\nWe waited to be seated, which wasn't an issue as we were a group of 8. The majority of us have all worked in restaurants so while I understand a party that size can be a burden, we know how to behave ourselves and make life easy for the server. After the one server mistakenly thinking we had cancelled we were finally sat. Apparently they were only doing garlic bread and pizza at that time, I understand that kitchens will partially close at certain times but they should really consider having something like a simple side salad available also. It doesn't need to be cooked and it would just be really nice to have some sort of green side available. Anyways, whatever, we were aware. I had the Pasquale's Combo, the pizza was great as always. Hot, fresh, and greasy. Just how I like it.\n\nThe bummer here is the service. Before our waitress even appeared I was kind of off-put by the older lady serving other tables. I could hear her being rude to other people and it didn't seem warranted. Our waitress showed up (not her thank goodness) and she was better but not by much. Short, gruff service ensued with a ridiculous wait for waters and a miscount in the sodas. I know it is late and maybe you hate people... but when I was management this never would have happened and when I was serving this would not have cut it.

We tried Paxti's but they said it would take over 45 mins just for a thin crust pizza.\n\nInstead, we chose trusty Pasquale's.  My girlfriend can't eat much here because the bread they use is so chewy and always cooked to a crisp (she has lock jaw).  I actually always liked their sandwiches even though Milano's used to do a way better Eggplant Parm, sadly they are gone and Pasquale's became my go-to place.\n\nStarving and tired as we were, we got take-out and brought it home.

Then I get some young girl and she tells me either I can come get the fries or she'll give me a credit.  So I asked, \"since you kinda ruined my meal you are giving me the credit for the meal right?\"\n\nShe just rudely says, \"I'll put the manager on the phone.\"\n\nAfter another long wait I get a guy who sounds like a bad actor asking me how he can help me.  I explain to him that I don't have the food I paid for and was just transferred to him so I'm not sure.   HE JUST PUTS ME ON HOLD AGAIN!!!\n\nThen I wait for another long while...   The same girl answers, \"Pick up or delivery?\"\n\nI got super pissed...  \n\nShe tells me that the manager said that I didn't need his help so he passed me on.\n\nWhat a freaking idiot, right??!??\n\nI explain to her that I still need to talk to someone (I guess)  and he comes back on the phone.\n\nI tell him and he starts yelling at me. \" Come get da fries\"   \"So what?  We left da fries!\"\n\nI also took a bite of my sandwich and it is STONE COLD.   So I explain to him that I am a regular and have eaten there over 40 times in the past year.  I was hoping that that would get him to stop yelling at me.  He tells me that it is impossible that a sandwich can be cold and told me that I must have been late picking it up!

As a real Italian, I hope this guy passes over his can opener and gives the place to a real chef and they put a real restaurant in this space.\n\nI am not going to need the french fry credit because I am never going back and I hope this review makes more people not want to give him their money.  \n\nI've been a loyal customer and tip really well even on take-out orders.

My dish was the veal parmigiano with vegetables and pasta. To my surprise, the pasta for my dish was brought out first out of everything we ordered. Our waitress let us know that \"the pasta side is served first here, that's just how it is\". The other two entrees then arrived five minutes later. Five minutes after that our garlic bread appetizer arrived. Then, fifteen minutes after my side was brought the rest of my dish was delivered. It's worth noting that I got to watch my dish sit on the counter while our waitress ignored it to expediate the order of a table of her friends who arrived after us. \nThe bad service continued thru the rest of our meal as our waitress continued to ignore us, telling us at one point that it was nothing personal and that they were understaffed that night(while she continued to talk to her friends). \nAt the end of our meal we had to wait for our waitress's her friends to tell her that we had been staring at her for over 10 minutes so that we could get our check. \n\nMore than the food quality(more on that in a second), what dissapointed me the most was the poor service and being ignored by our waitress. \n\nAs far as food goes, everything was mediocre at best. The pasta sauce was basic and flavor-less. The vegetables on the side of the dish didn't even have any seasoning. Our table also ordered the Chicken Dore(sp?) with fries in which there was a beyond liberal use of lemon juice. The fries were half-hazardly tossed in the side and thus were let to sit and soak in a copious and near unbearable amount of lemon. \n\nOverall our experience was unfortunately very poor. It seems this spot is a somewhat popular local pizza delivery joint, and it's probably best left as that unless they make some serious changes both in the kitchen and out front.", "author": "Kevin M."}

I thought maybe a vegitable wasn' t washed or something so I just continued with dinner untill my daughter spit something un-edible from her mouth as well; another pebble. \nSo I called pasquale's to tell them. The manager said that wasn't possible. He seemed to think we just wanted more pizza. He asked how many slices did you eat??\nI told him we noticed on our first slice and I have the un-edible items on my plate.\nHe argued with me for a few minutes and said ok if there is any more than two slices missing I can't help you and told me to give my eaten and uneaten pizza to the driver as he delivered another pizza. I was afraid to have another pizza delivered as the sauce would have to be the same one used on our first pizza. Well the driver picked up our uneaten pizza along with the 2 slices we started with. And I sent the un-edible items along too. Two pebbles and a twig or vine.\n I was pretty suprised and dissapointed that I had to even go thru this dance with the manager. I felt that he did not believe what I told him. \nHe did, however call me back a couple of hours later to say it must have been from the fresh herbs they use in the sauce. And said he was sorry.\nThat was the first time we'd ever had a bad experience with Pasquale's. \n\nUntill last night. That is.

On our recent visit, we had the most sausage and mushroom ever!!  I hope we get the same pizza maker next time.\n\nThis is a popular joint, but not so crowded that you have to wait a long time, even on weekends.  It offers a very casual dining atmosphere and is kids-firendly.  Having said that, it is not a first-date destination.\n\nA word of advice:  Having pizza to-go or delivered is highly discouraged.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-22", "description": "I've always been a big fan of Pasquale's pizza, but I had never had it inside the restaurant.  The norm for me is usually having it picked up and enjoyed among a big group of friends inside Yancy's Saloon on the same block.  Their crust is really pretty average and is slightly thicker than a good thin crust, but they definitely pile on the toppings.  Their Meat Eater and Charbroiler Chicken are a couple of my favorites.  It is countless times better once you've had a few drinks at Yancy's.\n\nPasquale's stays open pretty late, and I've always wondered about their large menu which features a wide selection of pasta dishes, meat and seafood entrees, appetizers, charbroiled meats and hot sandwiches.  I got out early from work one night recently to finally give the dining room at Pasquale's a try.  \n\nThe place was still pretty busy around 10 PM.  I made eye contact with the waiter who gestured to me to take any seat.  I did so as the waiter walked over, greeted me and placed a menu on my table.  For those of you curious about the menu I've scanned and copied a scaled down version and posted it in the photos section.  I was a bit hungry and thinking along the lines of which dish would yield the least wait time.  I settled on the Half Spaghetti, Half Ravioli.  You choose between cheese or meat raviolis.  I had the cheese.  Meatballs can be added to any of the traditional pasta dishes so I asked for that.  They give you a choice of four sauces: meat, marinara, Alfredo or pesto.  I selected the meat sauce.\n\nThe kitchen was definitely working on a fast pace on this night.  Within two minutes of placing my order the waiter brought me my soft drink along with a partial loaf of hot, crusty sourdough French bread.  The little pats of butter were chilled solid so I moved a couple of pats and allowed the hot bread to hover over them.  Worked like a charm as the the butter softened a short time later.  Chewy and crusty on the outside, hot and soft on the inside the bread was excellent.\n\nBefore I had even finished my first slice of bread my pasta arrived (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/5Q82x5hIwfWSF3XEeINkgQ/l).  The waiter joked that the kitchen was a bit slow that night.  The raviolis are big and round here.  I cut into a meatball and it was nice and firm (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/VOjmVyvr-2_uXB432VWB8Q/l).  The meatball was excellent with good flavor, good texture and a firmness to my liking.  The ricotta cheese-like filling inside the ravioli was very good.  The spaghetti was cooked al dente.  The meat sauce had big chunks of ground meat and was good in flavor but a bit on the runny side.  I would have enjoyed a thicker sauce.\n\nOverall, it was exactly what I had hoped for.  I got a delicious, filling, hot dinner with excellent service and very little wait time.  I'm sold on Pasquale's, and I'll be back.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Unlike other pizza places that have limp pizza slices with ingredients that slide off when you try to eat it, the pizza we had here was mostly crunchy, the toppings stayed where they're suppose to, and it's not too oily. I deducted points from this place for customer service because nobody greeted us even after I went up to the register where 2 waitresses were standing and one was busy discussing how much tip she just received from the table that left. We had to grab our own menu and stood back in front of the register for 5+ minutes until the lady on the phone took my order. No hi, no apologies for the wait, or anything from her before she took my order. The customer service here is definitely lacking, but if you are craving for pizza late night then this place is alright. The pizza didn't taste special, but it passes for good pizza.

We also noticed that the restaurant was severely fast at serving our plates, especially in between times with out appetizer (bruschetta) and our respected main courses.

My family bought pizza at Pasquales from time-to-time. Through college at USF I would go there with my buds and to the one byt hte zoo and load up on the awesome pizza after beer soaked nights. My wife and I moved 55 miles north 27 years ago and raised our kids in Larkfield. I don't get to the City much. Today, I went to a class of 1970 eighth grade reunion on 12th Ave. between Irving and Lincoln. It was a blast. There was fresh crab, lox, Bq'd tri-tip...you name it, and wine and beer for any appetite, taste. I had two things, the fresh crab, which my buddy caught, and a slice of pasquales, by this time room temp and as a background to conversation. At the end of the party a lot of pizza was still there. I should have asked for it. In that moment when a friend since fifth grade and I were talking and commenting on the quality of the pizza, it all came back to me. This was pizza that was exactly the same as when we were kids. Every square cm of it was covered in just the right amount of sauce, a generous helping of sausage, a balanced amount of mushrooms, cheese and sauce. I've made and had a lot of pizza over the years. Some of it was pricey and trendy, some, fru-fru bullshit hipster, some was just plain bad, some was expedient, and some was just, \"Thanks Lord for filling my gut.\". Nobody makes better pizza than Pasquales. I'm back home in Larkfield now, having a Lagunitas IPA in my nice warm home with a fire burning and all of us home. I have one want...Thanks for still being there!", "author": "Patrick L."}

Rich and flavorful, this stuff is the real deal!  \n\nThe prices here will shock you...in a GOOD way!!!!  In a city where hipster restaurant meccas are terribly over-priced for what are just mediocre Italian-knock-off meals with tiny portions, Pasquale's prices are very low and perfect for people on a budget who still want to go out for a delicious, hearty Italian dinner!  The restaurant is also pretty big by San Francisco standards, so you can easily come here with a big gang for supper and know you'll get a seat!  While this place doesn't have much going for it as far as high-design is concerned, that's not the point.  The food is.

When my BF went to pick it up, they handed him a totally different pizza with shrimp and bunch of anchovies plus some other mystery ingredient for $30. Clearly this was not something we ordered and they made a mistake. But the owner rudely claimed that \"they never make mistakes and it is no way the person on the phone  could possible screw up our order\". We had no choice but pay for something that we didn't even order or even liked! Just because we live in the neighborhood and have some sense of decency, we were left without a choice or apology.

It's my backup restaurant when I can't think of anything else to eat. What's to love here? I'll name some of my favorite  menu items:\n\n1) The Meatball Sandwich. Oh my god. I LOVE the meatball sandwich here. From the sourdough bread to the warm cheesy goodness to the french fries that come with it(if you ask!), the sandwich is delicious. This is my go to order when I don't feel like anything else. The best meatball sandwich I've ever eaten. A meatball sandwich to go is only $7.40.\n\n2) The Frutti Di Mare. Now, I'm a big linguine with fresh clams guy myself, but the Frutti Di Mare with red sauce here is awesome. The pasta sauce they use here is just tangy enough to be good and the seafood adds a nice touch.\n\n3) Sausage Pizza. It's simple, yet filling. Pasquale's pizza really hit's the spot. The crust is crispy and thin and not overpowering. The sauce isn't too sweet for the pizza. For the cheese, they use slices, and when it comes to your table, it's melty off the pizza goodness.\n\nMy favorite thing to do when I go here is split a meatball sandwich and small or medium sausage pizza. It's definitely enough food and you usually have leftovers.\n\nPasquale's also has a nice atmosphere. There decor reminds you of the usual Italian place, and they give you free bread like the usual italian restaurant. The bread here is sourdough though and it's delicious. The servers here are also really nice. The Filipino lady is fun to talk to and the man may be a bit awkward, but he is also friendly.\n\nAll in all, I give Pasquale's a 5/5. It's one of my favorite restaurants in SF.", "author": "Courtney Q."}

Pizza has always been consistently good and at a reasonable price.  It was definitely one of my favorite places to eat pizza around my neighborhood in San Francisco.  \n\nAfter today, I think Pasquale's has lost my business. I'll stick to the pizza joints on my side of the Park in The Richmond District (Gaspare's and Giorgio's).  No need to cruise over to The Sunset anymore for this place.  \n\nI got a half and half pizza today for the first time.  Normally, I just get one of the specialty pizzas.  I ordered an XL half and half.  I ordered a half specialty (Beef Mexicali - has 4 toppings), which was $25, and I ordered a half four topping custom, which was also $25.  Since they're equal in price, I figured I would pay $25.  But when the bill the came, it said that I owe $34 plus tax.  Wow! $9 extra for a half and half, I said? I asked the waitress why it was so much and she said it was $2.25 each per extra topping (4 toppings = $9). Wait a minute! I didn't get \"extra\" toppings.  I got a half four topping pizza and a half specialty pizza.  I didn't get a full specialty pizza with four extra toppings on top totaling 8 toppings throughout the whole pizza. I tried to explain to her my rationale about how I should only be charged $25, and that I was being overcharged for what I received. But she wasn't understanding my explanation, nor did she seem to care to rectify the situation to me, the customer, to my satisfaction. She said \"that's what it is.\" I quickly grabbed a menu and read the menu again, and thought, if that's the case on how they charge for half and half pizzas, then it is a ridiculous ripoff!! I've never been to a pizza place that charged half and half pizzas like they do here. I don't feel that I've gotten $9 worth of more pizza with only 4 toppings on each half.\n\nI hate to leave a place feeling I just got taken, but I felt that way after leaving Pasquale's today.  It's the principle of charging me fairly that weighs heavy in my book for patronizing a business as well as good customer service making sure that the customer is happy and satisfied.  I was pissed off for hours thinking that I paid $40 (after tax and tip) for an XL pizza that should've cost $32 (after tax and tip).  And after reading about the recent poor health scores, that helped seal the deal. Goodbye Pasquale's. You've lost the business of this native San Franciscan. Moral of the story, if you do come here for pizza, don't get a half and half, they'll rip you off.", "author": "Jason Y."}

Another 30mintues went by so I called back at 9pm asking about my delivery & was put on hold for 5+ minutes. Frustrated, I called back again & was told that there was a \"mix up with the tickets\" & that they will start on the sandwiches right now ... SERIOUSLY!! after 2 hours they have not started my order at all & expect me to wait another 45minutes or so, meaning that I wouldn't be eating until almost 10pm.\n\nI am so disappointed about what happened.

I decided to give this place a whirl despite the fact that Yelpers gave it a lower rating than the place up the street. Sometimes I just like to go against the grain and this was one of those times. \n\nIt was good but not great. Tasty crust, nice and crispy, lots of toppings and greasy enough to not be too greasy. Don't get me wrong, I love the right amount of grease on my pie, but it can easily head over the cliff and become a disaster. Service was really good, young folks with plenty of energy and that's always a good sign. I would probably go back for more, but I saw a lot of giant plates of pasta and other tasty Italian dishes buzzing by the table as I ate my mediocre pie.

When I have eaten with friends in the restaurant, the waitresses have always been really kind and attentive, and the food has been about a 'B.\" The guys behind the counter usually seem preoccupied and testy. I wanted to have Italian-American food from close to home one night; I decided to give Pasquale's delivery a try.\n\nIt was a Tuesday night at 9pm -- fairly early by Pasquale's standards.  I called to order some food for delivery.  The surly woman (no Italian accent there) who answered the phone could barely give me the time of day to take my order, which she got wrong several times, requiring me to clarify repeatedly.  I'm a clear speaker; not sure what her problem was. She was so ready to hang up the phone, she didn't even ask for my credit card number.  I had to ask her to please take the number.  Then she hung up the phone before telling me the time estimate for my food to arrive.\n\nAn hour later, the food had still not arrived.  I called to ask where my delivery was.  The same woman answered the phone and told me she would ask.  She put me on hold for a few minutes, then came back on the line to say, \"They've already left; it'll be there in a few minutes.\"  Again, an abrupt hang-up.\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, the food arrived.  A nice, middle aged man with an Italian accent brought it to the door.  I signed for it, and he left.  When I closed the door and opened my package of food, I discovered that the garlic bread with cheese that I'd ordered had not been included, but I had been charged for it on the bill.\n\nOur fried calamari was tepid and greasy.  The salad had no dressing -- we'd never been asked if we wanted any.  The pasta dishes we'd ordered were hot and tasty -- thank goodness.\n\nI called the restaurant again as we were eating and told the same woman what had happened.  She said, \"We'll find it and send it out.\"  Again, an abrupt hang-up.  When the same man came to the door, he delivered a small pizza box.  No apologies.  Not from him, and not from the woman. He left.\n\nI opened the box to find cold, burned garlic bread with cheese.\n\nThat was the last straw for me.\n\nI don't think I'll be ordering delivery from Pasquale's again.", "author": "Luke A."}

They have a large dining room area off to the side of where the Pizzas are made.

I've been expecting this to happen for the past two decades as I shoved atomic hot sauced food into my mouth.  I have friends that are very sensitive to food.  I know people who cannot tolerate spice, flavor, texture or grease.  I thought that had happened to me!\n\nOne Sunday lunchtime, the BF, Marina and I were scouting the inner sunset for establishments where we could watch FootBall.  None of us had cable.  And we wanted choices.  We also wanted food.  The BF asked for Indian food.  I quickly shut him down.  Not just for my stomach's sake but for the people who may sit next to me in the coming days.  It's not pretty going in, it's even uglier coming out.  No, that's not true.  It looks the same coming and going.  Saucy.\n\nFirst, we took care of the football watching.  Yancy's was a good choice because the front window room was rather empty except for some Bulgarians.  And they were eating a pizza from Pasquale's.  This inspired us to get some pizza from Pasquale's too.  I can't remember why I wanted to try the pizza.  It probably had to do with me being a big, fat, sloppy pig.  On any given day, melty cheese usually sounds good.  Yum.  Melty cheese.\n\nMarina went down the block and ordered a huge pepperoni and mushroom.  I went with her to pick it up.  The pie was just getting taken out of the oven.  Into the box it went.  Chop chop chop chop chop.  10 slices.  As I carried the pizza box out of the store and back to Yancy's, I had to resist the urge to turn it vertical in order to make a 3rd Rock from the Sun joke.  \n\nThe pizza was thin but not paper-like.  The BF likes bready pizza (obviously insane) but even he was pleased with this one.  There was a chewy crunch to the crust.  The upskirt/bottom crust was sufficiently baked to hold up the toppings.  There was not too much cheese rendering the whole thing too salty.  There was a lot more sauce on it than other places but in a good way.  The sauce had zing.  Flavor.  And it did not squirt out.  The sauce was not sweet.  I hate sweet sauces.  Hate.  \n\nThe pepperoni had a very smooth salty flavor.  Not overly greasy curled up cups of meat tube.  There was an absence of bright orange oil.  The mushroom had an earthy flavor.  I dislike it when mushrooms are shriveled up and dried out on top of pizzas.  This place did not do that.  The mushrooms were cooked and blended well with the rest of the flavors.  \n\nSince I make very good pizza and have no job, I do not frequently buy pizza.  But this place makes me want to get a job and develop the metabolism of a teenage football player so I can have pizza all the time.  \n\nThis pizza was employment-motivating.", "author": "Christina C."}

If you don't get drinks, you can easily walk out spending under $10. \n\nParking: Street, metered. After 6pm it's free. Yes, it can be a hassle because it gets crowded on Irving at night.

At the time, we thought we would \"settle\" for pizza. Afterward, I was claiming Pasquale's among San Francisco's finest.  Throw in the price and you also have one of San Francisco's best deals.

We were a party of four adults and 2 babies under the age of 12 months. Not knowing the areas restaurants we opted to go with Pasquale's for are lunchtime meal. First off, I have to say that Pasquale's was family friendly as most Italian restaurants should be. \n\nWe started off our order with the antipasto salad ($9.70) came complete with salami, mortadella, mozzarella slices, romaine lettuce, olives, garbonzo beans, and onions. The salad was a fantastic opening act for the rest of the meal. The next thing that came out was the fettuccine alfredo ($9.65) which was rich and creamy in a cheese sauce that I wanted to baptize my first child in. The last and final dish was the pizza. We order the meat pizza ($23.50) which I was ecstatic about because I didn't know one of the people we were with well and wasn't sure if she was a radical animal liberation vegetarian or vegan, that we picked up from the Anarchist Book Fair.  The meat pizza was a carnivores dream come true. It had salami, pepperoni, beef, and sausage and truly a greasy-meaty masterpiece that would have made Salvador Dali proud. \n\nI have to admit that I over did it and ate way too much pizza and pasta. My eyes glazed over and the food coma was kicking in. I tried to perk myself up with a second cup of Coke which, as you may already know, was not a well thought out plan. I pulled myself up, put the baby in the stroller and went for a long walk at Golden Gate Park in hopes to instill some life back in me, but all I wanted to do was stuff my face some more. \n\nI loved Pasquale's and would definitely come back again. Is it the best pizza or pasta I ever had? No, but the food is delicious, tasty, and a great value at the prices. To me, there is nothing better than sharing a bowl of pasta, salad, and slices of delicious pizza with friends and family at a place as comfortable and welcoming as Pasquale's.

With that being said, the smell of Chinese food, steaks grilling, Kurry, pasta, and coffee was just running wild in the area. This was not helping my appetite or or my decision making. \n\nI turn the corner and saw an old neon light sign shining Pizzeria in the middle. Right above Pizzeria I read in cursive Pasquale's. Being a sucker for old style neon signs and Italian names I said why not. While walking up, I yelped this place and almost everyone was talking about the pizza. \n\nSo I walk across the street and saw the whole pizza making area from the sidewalk. The pizza lab was well lit, clean, and you can just tell these guys know what they were doing. So I now walk in and saw walk past the pizza lab and juke box. The hostess that night was nice and led me to a table. So I'm walking across the room and saw that everyone is digging on the pizza. I'm thinking to myself \"All they have is pizza\". I'm seated and open the menu. Wow they have more than pizza. \n\nI love pizza, but I when I read the menu and saw this place had more to offer I figure why not try a plate. Pasta, salads, and sandwiches........ooooh grilled chicken with fried prawn. When the server came back to take my order she brought a basket of toasted soar dough bread. Ahhhhh sour dough bread I love sour dough bread. \n\nSo 10-15 minutes pass and I'm sipping on my tea, and digging on the bread. BAM my meal arrives, hot, steaming, and looking good. So I was happy to see my order of grilled chicken and fried prawns was accompanied by mushrooms, steam veggie, and a plate of pasta with meat sauce. \n\nTo make a long story short, the chicken was moist and had flavor. I don't like mushrooms but the mixture of the chicken complimented it each other and the prawns were a delightful. All in all everything tasted fresh, and better than most places I've been to. For the quality and amount of food, the price was great. \n\nI've so far have been to Pasquale's a total of 3 times and have tried the chicken parmigiana and bruschetta.

Great thin crust cheese pizza, and as an added bonus, they have a terrific Baked Ziti, another of my New York comfort foods you don't see out here.\nThe only small gripe - they don't sell pizza by the slice. Their solutions is a personal pie, about the size of a dinner plate, and it's cut into 8 little slices. Likewise the medium pie comes with slices that are not the conventional NY Pizza slice size, so it doesn't lend itself to picking up the slice, folding it in half, and starting at the tip and working your way down.

I ordered 1/2 ravioli and speghetti. I did not like how the marinara sauce was diluted and the pasta was over done. And my plate came out first before my friends' pizzas came. \n\nThe server was nice until she yelled at my friends and me. She offered my table bread which I later learned was for MY pasta. She expressed how my friends' pizzas are still cooking so they can work on the bread. On the third time my table asked for bread, the waitress scowled at us and said the bread is for me because I'm having pasta. In addition to that, this woman in her 40s was being immature and called my friends \"bread-hogs.\" Mind you, she's the one who offered bread to the community in the first place. Plus, my friends didn't eat my bread once they got their pizza. She was totally making false assumptions without understanding what's going on. In the end, I was still hungry and I didn't get bread anymore. \n\nAgism is definitely a factor at this location. I noticed the servers are more accomadating to the middle-aged adults rather than young adults. For instance, they made a college girl move across the room while SHE WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF HER DINNER! I was furious FOR her. The servers totally did not respect her space AND the fact how she hasn't finished her meal. I hope she tipped them less than needed. They deserved it. \n\nAnother thing that bothered me was their floor. Their carpet is NASTY. Have you ever accidently stepped on gum? Try dining with gum under your shoe. Definitely cannot keep my mind off my sticky soles while trying to enjoy my dinner. \n\nAlthough I may have listed multiple cons, I have discovered a couple of pros in this \"fine\" dining restaurant. The cashier ladies are nice and friendly. (Maybe because they are my peers, in their 20s.) Aaaand they are open until midnight. \n\nOverall, I will not revisit this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-28", "description": "When I first moved into the inner sunset area, my boyfriend and I were looking a good pizza place.  We walked into Pasquale's and looked around, but decided that it seemed just ok, so we walked out and decided to try somewhere else.  \n\nBut the other day, I received a gift certificate for Pasquale's, so it was time to finally try it out.  As with our first impression of the place, Pasquale's doesn't really look like much.  It's kind of different because you walk into an area where they make the pizzas and then turn a corner to wait for a table.  The place is actually fairly sized and was pretty lively when we went for dinner, Friday night around 8:30.  \n\nSince we had the gift certificate, my boyfriend and I went all out and way over-ordered.  My boyfriend got the antipasto salad and I ordered the caesar salad.  As our main dishes, my boyfriend got the Shrimp linguine and I ordered the seafood platter entree with a side of gnocchi ($1 extra, because penne with marinara is the standard side).\n\nWe also each ordered a soda ($1.50) and drank it all pretty quickly because we were pretty thirsty, and then were informed that they don't offer refills. Bummer.\n\nThey started us off with some fresh sourdough bread and butter, which was pretty decent, but we were trying to save room for the feast we were about to devour.  Our salads came really quickly, within 5 minutes of placing our order, and they were humongous.  They were huge plates, piled and piled with food.  Honestly, these salads could have been our meals and we would have been pretty much stuffed.  We could have even shared one and been adequately full.  \n\nCaesar salad: very cheesy, lots of croutons, a fair amount of dressing.  Pretty standard.\n\nAntipasto salad: slices of tomato, slices of cheese, olives, slices of different deli meats, a fair amount of italian dressing.  This salad was extra huge.\n\nThen, came our entrees.\n\nSeafood platter: about a third of the plate was covered in lightly fried calamari, about 6 deep fried shrimp, and maybe about 15 small deep fried scallops.  The scallops were my favorite, very juicy and coated in seasoning/breadcrumbs.  There was also a portion of veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots).  I also had a side of gnocchi; it tasted fresh and was pretty doughy.  Not the best, but definitely a nice change from the usual penne pasta.\n\nSeafood linguine: this was the highlight of the meal.  The 6 large butterflied shrimp were delicious.  The sauce was very buttery and very creamy and very cheesy, pretty much everything you'd want from a good alfredo sauce.  My boyfriend was already full before his pasta arrived, but this didn't stop him from eating about half of the plate, and the plate was huge.  \n\nAfter finishing eating, we still had about half of the meal.  The waitresses took our plates away and boxed everything for us.  \n\nOverall, Pasquale's offers good food, large portions, fair prices and good service.  It's definitely worth a try (even though it doesn't look like much from the front).  I'll be back to try the pizza soon.\n\nNotes: \n-They don't have a parking lot, look for street parking.\n-Consider sharing a salad and/or an entree.  The portions are really big.\n-You can upgrade the side of penne to a side of gnocchi for $1.\n-They don't have free soda refills (even though they have a fountain dispenser).", "author": "Samantha L."}

It's definitely not the best food in the world, but it was horrible either. Service was just decent. I mean everything was just okay. Perhaps, my whole evening was tainted by fights and arguments and a massive headache from finals studying, but really, it could have been much better.\n\nFood:\nVeal Dore: There are two options - either you can get it with pasta and vegetables or French fries. Really? French fries? That seems so...classless to get French fries at a Italian restaurant. It was weird to get my pasta first, which seems like underdone pasta with some marinara sauce on top. The pasta might have been \"al dente\" but it was WAY too chewy for my tastes. Maybe 30 secs to 1 min more in the boiling water would have been good. The veal was pretty good; it was tender, but had a nice bite to it, but the sauce was way to powerful. There were just way too many herbs in the lemon butter sauce. Just not good. Big portions though for its price.\n\nService:\nIt was decent I guess. Since it was basically empty when we showed up at around 7pm which seems like prime time for dinner. We were allowed to sit anywhere. Water was served right away, soon after the waitress took our order for dinner. Everything was served pretty timely, but it was just average. They weren't particularly nice...nor mean.\n\nOverall, I don't know if I'll be back. I mean I like other Italian restaurants much more. I'm not sure about in the Sunset area, but in Berkeley, I have couple of restaurants that I just always go to. They may not have the best service, but I'm not expecting it.

I was hankering for a pizza. Usually I prefer the Napoli-style but sometimes just a simple greasy thin crust does the job. So I rang Pasquale's and placed the order. I had no access to ice and was **dying** for an icy cold soda with my pizza. I explained my predicament to the man taking the order, asked for two cups of ice and offered to pay extra for them. He said it was no problem and that they'd deliver in 45 minutes.\nLess than 3/4 hour passes and the pizza delivery man arrives. The pie is hot, and he hands me a cold plastic bag that contained another plastic bag- FILLED with ice cubes. This was about 5 lbs worth!

Pasquale's put up a decent fight though.\n\nThe best quality a Pasquale's pizza offers is the crust.  If you leave the crust regular (you have to option to customize its thickness), it provides a consistent, delightful blend of crunchiness and chewiness throughout your pizza experience.  The crust's consistency remains from your initial bite at the tip of the slice to when you polish off the ends that you are holding.  It is able to withstand the strain of sauces and oils that rest on top.\n\nWe ordered the all meat pizza and Mediterranean pizza.  One of the downsides of the menu is that if you wish to have different halves on the same pizza, they will charge you extra for any topping that is not shared between the halves.  This is the first time I have been to a pizza place where they do not simply charge you for the more expensive half.  This would have been a greater inconvenience if we did not have enough people to order two pizzas.\n\nThe flavor of the toppings on both pizzas were also a slight disappointment.  Although the toppings were plentiful on both pies, it seemed like salt was the main topping on the all meat pizza, and the pesto flavor was masked on the Mediterranean.  I could understand an all meat pizza being a little salty, but I was chugging water from the first bite on like I had just finished crossing the Sahara desert.  I am a huge fan of pesto pizzas, but on the Mediterranean, the other toppings had a more prominent role, making the pesto seem like an afterthought.\n\nThe service was very friendly, and we were seated immediately, but there is some left to be desired if you are here to try the pizza.", "author": "Andrew M."}

When you calculate hundreds of items they sell in a day, that is skimming.\nIn the past, I always notice the price is higher than I mentally calculate the bill, but  I do not use a calculator  to calculate the detail bill.  This time I am teaching a child to calculate the cost, and I thought she does the math wrong. Only when I calculate myself , then I notice the discrepancy  and I ask the cashier to break down the price of each dish.\nIt is then that I find out that they round up tax on each dish and then round up again at the end of the bill.  The delivery charge is $1.00 and they add tax on it.  When I ask the delivery guy for the receipt, he refuse to give it to me and was very rude and ask me to sign on the receipt for the bill because I am paying with a credit card.  There is no amount  stated and I sign it with no copy or the amount adding the tips.They can overcharge me on my credit card and I have no way to even disputes it when I get my credit card statement  with no copy and signing on the bill.  I called the restaurant  to ask for a copy of my charge.\nI have a right to have a copy of my bill. At the least a copy of my credit card charge.\nWhen I confront the owner on the phone, he gives me excuse as it is convenient  for the cashier  to do it as individual item with the tax included with rounding up or down.

It looked pretty nondescript on the outside and seemed pretty mellow, which was perfect for us.\n\nUpon setting foot inside, the place immediately gave off this indescribable aura of \"legit-ness\". Its hard to describe. There is the counter at the entrance where you see people hand preparing pizzas, the decorations inside, and just the overall atmosphere. Maybe it was just the crowd and the time we went, but it was a very calm and friendly environment.\n\nUpon sitting, we got promptly served some very sour sourdough. It may have been my imagination, but maybe our bread was a taaad bit underbaked? I dunno. It was pretty tasty anyway, no real complaints. it went great with the butter they provided and was gone pretty quickly. Our group ordered some pizzas and a friend ordered a shrimp salad. I must say though, this place makes some impressive thin crust pizza. The crust was very crisp, the ingredients were quality, and it came fairly promptly. I got the mushroom, peperonni, and salami (?) pizza. It is worth noting they give a loooot of toppings, which is a huge plus in my eyes. I finished about half the pizza and took the rest home and a day later,  I was pleasantly surprised that it reheats VERY well. Yay.\n\nI don't go out to that area of SF very often and I prefer trying new places before going to a place I've eaten at before, so I don't know if i'll return anytime soon.

The pie dough was crust (I looked underneath my slice) and was not that impressed with the dough. It is a thin pizza but the pizza was over cooked and the cheese tasted rubbery. I've definitely had better...\n\nI did like the sourdough bread they brought out for you though. They warm it up for you and it was definitely fresh. I think I ate the whole loaf myself!

My friend made reservations the day before and we all got there on the dot and it took 20 minutes for them to get us seated. It was a relatively empty restaurant. When we were finally seated the waitress never came around and even yelled at us to wait when we tried to flag her down. When she finally came over she told us we were getting the all you can eat special and we were confused because we didn't order yet! We said no that's not what we wanted and she got really huffy and kept insisting that's what we ordered over the phone  my friend said she did nothing of that sort and only made reservations. The waitress walked away. It took another 10 minutes for her to come back and take our order. We were so tempted to get up and walk away but we waited so long already and were starving. Ridiculous.

We complained, and initially got the support of the manager who reprimanded the waiter that overcharged us.

Whether you are ordering off the menu or creating your own topping choices, you can never go wrong. They can also make the pizza dough extra thin like the Neapolitan style or even extra crispy by request. I usually like my pizza thin and crispy. \n\nThe restaurant is very family style oriented like an Italian trattoria. It is a place where locals living in the neighborhood go and a place where everybody working at the restaurant knows your name. The wait staff have been working there forever so the services you get is consistent. The most exciting part of the restaurant has to be the long pizza counter by the window where you can watch the chefs toss pizza dough in the air and construct the pizzas from scratch. \n\nThe pasta on the other hand is not impressive. Almost every time I order a pasta dish the pasta are over cooked and never al dente. Also in my opinion, they are a little generous with the sauce or should I say too generous because the pasta is always swimming in the sea of marinara or white cream sauce. However their lasagna is very hearty and baked to perfection with a healthy portion enough for two. \n\nOther dishes like veal Milanese, egg plants Parmesan, veal piccata are well made, home-style cooking and simple recipes that are worth trying. \n\nNo doubt I am not thrill with their pasta, but I like going to Pasquale mainly because I've been going there for years now, the staff are friendly and services are good every time. Pasquale is not a fancy, 5-Star Michelin's restaurant, but it is a comfortable, casual local hang out with good Italian food.", "author": "Gourmet Princessa L."}

Maybe it's just me.  Since I wasn't a fan but everyone else I was dining with that night is, I'm going to write my thoughts and then give their points of view too, so that you get an opinion from both sides of the spectrum.  \n\nClassic neighborhood Italian place: green, red and white color scheme, older tables and decor, large counter for you to watch them make the dough, and young waiters.  Lots of pasta, pizza, salad and appetizer options.  Menus were kinda dirty though.  Maybe it's time to get some new menus.  \n\nThey offered garlic cheese pesto bread which my other half promptly ordered even though our out of towner was discussing lactose intolerance issues as he ordered.  That was okay, but I felt the bread was a bit soggy.  My fiance, liked it, and ate more than one serving, but yet he didn't finish the whole order.  The out of towner was laying off carbs I think, and the best friend, she ate mini slice.\n\nWe also got the baked ravioli which didn't knock my socks off but the best friend seemed to love it, as did the fiance- I felt it was just a bunch of pasta stuffed with cheese and covered in cheese and red sauce.  I think maybe I'm just not a red sauce fan.  \n\nAnd of course, we also got two pizzas that I didn't like because it was so heavy that the toppings and cheese fell off when you picked it off- you had to eat it with a fork and knife.  Me- I like super thin crust pizza that when you lift it up and fold it in half to put in your mouth, nothing falls off............... This one was too full of stuff ( that to me didn't taste all that great) and the crust was too think.  Again my best friend and fiance, and the out of towner liked it.  \n\nSo, maybe it's me that is the problem.  Maybe it's them, and they don't know good food.  Either way, I probably will be back, since everyone else loves it.  And maybe then I'll just have to try someone thing else until something sticks with me as something I like.

I have tried many pizza places in San Francisco over the years and some of them are good or even better than Pasquale,s but this is and has always been our go to pizza place!

I also love the minestrone soup and bread as well! It's hard to believe but I have never tried their pasta or anything else they serve here, but that's because whenever we are here it's for pizza! I do have some critiques though! When we order a sausage pizza the sausage is always way too salty and ruins the whole pizza from the over powering saltiness!

Not only me, but my brother have both noticed that sometimes we'll order a salami and mushroom pizza and it taste just bad! The pizza does not have enough sauce, the crust is burnt on the bottom, it seams like they are skimping on the cheese and the mushrooms even taste different! And it just tastes salty!

Our little family of 4 hung out in the city today and I was actually hoping to devour some dry fried chicken wings down the street, but we were starving and upon passing San Tung and witnessing the crowd waiting for tables outside, it got vetoed. Drove up Irving and scored a spot in front of the post office, metered unfortunately. So that only gave us an hour. \n\nWe're boring when it comes to pizza. Sausage and mushrooms. And we also ordered a side of fries, b/c I wasn't sure if the lilmiss would dig pizza this time around. The fries were of the steak variety. Yum, my favorite. Came out nice and hot and soon our pizza followed. I loooooooooooove the crisp crust of their pizza. Just the right amount of toppings too. We all shared a medium and it was more than enough. The fries... there weren't any left.\n\nWe normally don't eat in when it comes to pizza, we're delivery or pick up kinda people and we enjoy eating in the comfort of our own home. But Pasquale's was definitely a nice change in our usual pizza routine. And thankfully the weather was nice in the city today too.", "author": "Dina V."}

Serviceable pizza served by an awfully polite staff in an atmosphere that I kind of like, even though I like neither college kids nor children. (Can't quite explain that one. I don't know, is it like vestigial? Redolent of happy birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese's? Something like that.)\n\nIf you really want to get your pizza fix in this neighborhood and have an oven, pick up a pizza from Arizmendi and bring it home. If you feel up to a (very) small wander, then head to Club Deluxe on Haight. And if you're feeling really ambitious then, well...you're in San Francisco; the sky's the limit. No need to hang out on a very small hill.\n\n\n\n*By \"serviceable pizza\" I mean: crust that is not at all crispy but is instead doughy and moist and chewy; and tomato sauce that has very little in the way of herbs, zings, or other elements that might make you pause and say to yourself, Now *that's* interesting. To be honest, so much else is negotiable, but not these two things.", "author": "T U."}

The first time I ate at the restaurant and the pizza was good, but not fantastic. The restaurant itself is not impressive and we walked past the place twice before we realized it was pizza place and walked in; It's a little old an dingy and lacks character. It also took a really really long time for us to receive our pizza. \n\nThe second time I ate at Pasquale's Pizza was a night I went to Yancy's, which is just a few steps away. We ordered pizza, picked it up and enjoyed it with our beer. This time I really enjoyed the pizza and thought it was fantastic. I don't know if it was the beer, the atmosphere or the actual pizza but I that night at Yancy's I thought I was eating pizza from a completely different Place. \n\nSo if I had to rate Pasquale's based on my first dining experience there I would have definitely given them two stars. Although the pizza was good the service and place was not. \n\nBut if I had to rate Pasquale's based on the pizza I had the night I went to Yancy's I would have given them four stars.

When my bff and I went to P's, I was a little disappointed with the pizza but chalked it up to theh fact I was used to Chicago deep dish and NYC-style pizza.  I've had pizzas from here periodically over the years but do not find it any better (or worse) then any other pizza you can get from Cybelle's or Milano's or Romano's or, now, Patxi's.  The crust seems a little less \"soggy\" then the other places (my friend loves to take that edge crust and butter it up and eat it separately).  Have never had anything else but the pizza.  And like all these pizza place, when you order an achovy pizza they hardly give you any anchovies--and I've ordered a pizza with double the anchovies and you still get very few.  But, I like my pizzas-in-California a little more cooked (so the stuff on top gets just a little browned and crispy) so I always shove the pizzas into the oven to cook for 10-15 mins longer after we get them delivered, and on the anchovy pizzas I just put a couple more cans of fish on there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2006-07-23", "description": "Someone call the COPS, because I've been ROBBED!\n\nI hereby endeavor to perform a public service by proclaiming that any review herein of Pasquale's above 2 stars is the product of mass hypnosis conducted at Pasquale's bequest.\n\nOr at least that's the only explanation I can come up with for the absurdly high ratings that Yelpers have given this place.\n\nSo it started like this:  I was craving pizza and caesar salad, so I combed through Yelp looking for the right spot.  I decided to make a Sunday pilgrimmage to Pasquale's based on the ratings herein.\n\nI had to abandon my pizza + caesar combo plan when I discovered it would cost me over $20 (not counting tax and tip!), so I went with caesar ($6) and meatball sandwich ($6.25) instead.  The waitress warned me that the salad was large, but this was music to my ears.  The meal started off fine, with sourdough bread & butter to go along with my salad.\n\nNow, I fancy myself as a bit of a ceasar salad officianado.  I've tried the caesar salad at probably close to 100 restaurants (if not more) in Oregon, California, Arizona and Hawaii.  You could say that I'm on a perpetual quest for the perfect ceasar.  In my book, a perfect caesar follows the traditional recipe to the letter (although a bit of creativity is allowed, if it's GOOD creativity), and all the ingredients must be fresh (which goes without saying).\n\nPasquale's caesar fails in two important respects:  they don't follow the traditional recipe (not even a hint of anchovy, and they add some weird herb mix instead), and they use prefab croutons straight out of a box (I know this beyond any doubt because I've been served them at least half the time that I've ordered caesar at a restaurant).  Whoever wrote that the croutons are \"fresh\" is a FOOL (your 'Elite' status be damned)!  The dressing certainly was strong tasting, and there was plenty of it (if not too much).  Curiously, I found a lonely little garbonzo bean at the bottom of my salad--which has to make you wonder exactly how these salads are prepared.\n\nStill, up to this point I was feeling generous and willing to consider...3 stars.  But then came the meatball sub.  Where to begin dissecting this travesty?  With the worst part, of course:  the sauce.  In my book, the absolute worst insult to a tomato sauce is to call it BLAND.  And that is EXACTLY how to describe this sauce:  BLAND.  No taste of herbs, garlic, or even tomato!  It basically was like red water.  The sandwich was served with french fries, and I'll eat my shorts if they weren't Ore-Ida right out of the freezer.  In all honesty, the Heinz Tomato Ketchup that came with the fries was MUCH tastier than Pasquale's tomato sauce.  Think about that for a minute.\n\nThe sandwich was prepared with the same bread that came with my salad (hard sourdough), only toasted.  Barely discernable within each cavernous half were two modest-sized meatballs, some melted mozarella, and maybe a little parmesean cheese.  Despite a relatively generous slatheringing of sauce, the sandwich was still BLAND.  After struggling through the first half, I split open the other half and just ate the meatballs.  How were the meatballs?  In a word, BLAND.\n\nC'mon, Yelpers, is THIS the best SF has to offer?  NO WAY!  I hereby challenge any and all Yelpers to come up with the best--no, good--wait, shoot, at this point I'll take halfway decent--place to get pizza and caesar.

The service (with few exceptions) is friendly and good - usually \"appropriately\" timed (not too fast/not too slow) although it can get a bit slow when crowded.  Food quality is excellent: Pizza is very good (sausage especially yummy), Lasagna is very good, the \"Charbroiled Misto\" (combo of grilled meats over mushrooms w/veggies or fries) is super-yummy.  The Penne Alla Sicillano is my fave: LOTS of garlic, sausage, fresh tomatoes, peppers, and onions...if you dig those flavors than ya gotta try this one!  Sandwiches are also good (and a good deal price-wise) and come with a decent side salad.   Easily 4 stars here.\n\nUnfortunately, take-out/delivery is another story.  Folks taking the orders on the phone are rude (e.g., \"Pasquales, please hold\" click!...this happens too often).  They rush thru the order, and (for delivery) don't ask if you want to pay cash or charge and the delivery folks (who are nice) aren't too happy when you hand 'em the plastic and they're expecting greenbacks.  Food quality seems to suffer as well, especially the pizza which never seems quite as good as eat-in.  When picking up orders, they often come off as \"we're doing you a favor handing you your food\" which bugs me. Possible this has gotten better as I haven't done take-out/delivery in several months, but that was my experiences for about the last 5 years.\n\nWill give props for being one of the few eateries in the area that's open 'till midnight weekdays.\n\nSo - strong recommendation to go in for a meal, and mixed feelings for take-out.", "author": "Steve E."}

It's exactly everything you'd want your pizza to be. As prone as I am to hyperbole and exaggeration, I'll leave you with an anecdote as opposed to a detailed description of their pizza to convey my message.\n\nWhen I was little, my grandmother would always take us to the Round Table Pizza on 16th and Geary. We'd actually spend a lot of time there eating and playing games. After a time though, we stopped going. I guess when my grandmother passed, it just wasn't the same. It turns out that my dad hated pizza all along, as he had some aversion to tomato sauce and generally had a very Asian leaning palette. Well, my sister likes to order take out, and one day, she ordered pizza from Pasquale's. When my dad came home he saw that he didn't want to eat any of the leftovers in the fridge. After he saw our pizza, I guess he felt tempted enough by the aroma of the piping fresh pepperoni and softly fresh baked crust of our pizza to give it a try. He then went back for another one and then another. I can remember him saying specifically that Pasquale's pizza was better than pizza.\n\nAnd on a rainy day like today, when you don't want to step outside for dinner...there really isn't anything like having fresh baked Pasquale's pizza delivered to your door. My only real complaint would be that it's kinda expensive. I used to think it was worth it...but after trying other pizza joints that are a little more moderately priced, I find I'm beginning to weigh my options more and more (which isn't something I used to do). Still, I'd recommend Pasquale's, and if you're wondering why the 4 stars and not 5 after a glowing review...you'll know why after you get the bill.", "author": "Philip W."}

The skin's got a little bit of a crunch, the inside is tender and the flavor is good.  If you want hot wings, bust out your own hot sauce and use it as a dip, it actually does the trick.  I prefer these with a side of my own hot sauce over most of the hot wings I've tried recently.\n\nGood, easy, affordable.  I like it!", "author": "Melissa A."}

I had arranged (and confirmed that morning) with Pasquale's Pizza on Irving to deliver the pizza by 12:15pm so that the children could enjoy their pizza during their lunch break from 12:30-1pm before heading outside to play.  Unfortunately the pizza was not delivered until 12:45pm and by the time the kids got the pizza and sat down to eat it was late into the break and many were rushed to eat because they wanted to go out to play.  \n\nI am very upset with Pasquale's Pizza since I called 4 times between 12:15pm and 12:45pm and each time I was lied to regarding the whereabouts of the driver.  One such lie was that the Pasquale's employee was on the phone with the driver and that the driver was looking for parking.  I was at that moment, standing in front of the school next to two or three open spaces.  When the driver finally arrived, I asked him when he had left the restaurant and he replied that the pizza was just finished and that he had rushed straight to school.\n\nAfter delivering the pizza to the kids, I went back to Pasquales to complain to the owner/manager, Joe.  He told me that he will give ME a free pizza next time I call.  I told him that the pizza was not for me, but for 23 1st grade students and that they were the ones that were missing lunch and had missed out on their eating/playing time.  He didn't care.  I told him that if he really wanted to make it up to the kids, that he would deliver 3 large cheese pizzas (about $50 worth) to school ON TIME on the last day of school.  He told me that there was NO WAY he would do that, again saying he would give me a free pizza.  I told him again that it was not me that was hurt by his lack of good business and that I would never order pizza from Pasquale's again because of his attitude towards children and a school.  I would like to encourage all of you to think about this situation next time you are thinking about ordering a pizza, and I hope that you will consider another restaurant and NOT Pasqualle's on Irving. \n\nThank you for your time.", "author": "Irene M."}

All we want is a meatball pizza and some more tomato sauce on a pizza, Is that too much to ask of a west coast pizzeria? One weekend on our way back from partying in the city, we decided to swing by Pasquales and pick up a sausage pizza to take back to the burbs.

What's the lure: A frenzy of smells and flavors filling the street, cause they keep their doors flung open and the waft of pizza dough baking, herbs and spices bursting open by the heated oven beckon you to come forward, a perfect street corner location and giant windows for viewing pleasure of the kitchen staff making and baking the pizzas.

Other than that, if you want better pizza than this, go to Safeway, get something from the frozen food aisle, preheat oven to 425, place in oven for 8-10 minutes, and you have a pizza that is far superior to this place.  I ate here almost a week ago and will never go back.  Hardly any sauce on the goddamn pizza, and that's just for starters.  I don't know these people giving it more than 2 stars.

I honestly can't remember why..perhaps because it was the first pizza I had on a regular basis with my family? We used to order this every weekend, an extra large with veggies and salami and I swear at only 6 or 7 I could eat the whole thing on my own. I couldn't stand my dad, he always made me eat it with a knife and fork, but I ignored him (he's another horrible story all together though which I won't share on here) Anyway, I haven't been here since I was about 10 or 11 and I guess I should go to see if it's changed at all. I think they may have changed owners or pizza chefs since then. But as far as how I remember the pizza, it was medium thin, crispy crust and a good amount of cheese and the owners and servers there knew us well as we were regulars. It's just full of memories for me, so no matter if it's the same or not it's getting 4 stars for now until I try it again, for giving me an ounce of joy while growing up in a chaotic and dysfunctional household.", "author": "Petra S."}

So, we call the manager, who after confirming that we have someone else's pizza, asks if we'd like to keep it, and when we tell him, \"No,\" says that in another 40 mins they'll bring us the right pizza, but we'll have to return the wrong pizza to them.

After a short wait we were seated (note, it was crazy busy everywhere that night, so I didn't mind the wait). We had a medium choose-your-own-toppings pizza and a ceasar salad. For some reason, I love drinking regular coke with pizza. I usually don't drink soda at all, and may occasionally have a diet coke at work, but for some reason, I ONLY want regular coke with pizza. Anyways, I ordered a regular coke, and to my dismay, it was from their fountain and only midly carbonated. Bleh, way to make me waste some calories, Pasquales! Moving on, the ceasar salad was humongous, but overly cheesy and with about 50% limp lettuce. There was no discernable anchovy taste either, so it didn't really seem like a ceasar, but when you're starving, you just go with it. The pizza came out, solid 3 stars. The crust was crispy, and with a good distribution of ingredients so you got all the toppings in each bite. Yay! I was all set to give this place 2.5 stars (rounded up to to three because I thought the servers were very nice), but near the end of the meal, the door leading to a back room kept opening up mysteriously and letting in seriously drafty air. I didn't really understand it, and at one point actually got up, walked halfway across the room to close it. Thirty seconds later, it opened again. Maybe it was a ghost? Anyways, we were almost done with our meal, otherwise, I would have said something, though I did notice that even the other patrons sitting near the door kept themselves bundled up because it was freezing in there.

The house special came loaded with meats and mushrooms (it was actually a little too much).  We also had an order of the Frutti di Marre Linguini.  I could not believe how much seafood was in the dish.  Not your avg. 2-3 pieces of each shellfish; the plate was loaded with clams, mussels, scallops, and squid (I forgot if there were prawns).  We had to wonder if they got the linguini portions mixed up with the seafood.  I don't know about others, but our server was very responsive and cordial.  The owner even helped seat us.  I did notice that some of the younger waitresses looked like they didn't like the work, but we didn't have to deal with them.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-23", "description": "I'd have given Pasquale's easily 4 stars when I last ate there about 3-1/2 years ago (when I lived in the Bay Area a friend and I used to eat there almost every Sunday afternoon).  But since 2006 it's changed, and not for the better, a far cry from when I was a loyal customer from 1990 to 2006.\n\nFirst, the good:  Actually, the pizza and Caesar salad we ordered was excellent.  No complaints at all.  Made just the way we ordered it.\n\nNow, the bad (and why I only rated them 2 stars):  I ordered iced tea, but forgot they use that funny-tasting (to me, anyway) tea that's sweetened or flavored or whatever.  So I asked the server to switch to coffee.  (They don't offer free refills on sodas, and one soda will never last me an entire meal, so iced tea or coffee works for me, which they do refill.)  The coffee was awful, like it had been sitting on the burner for awhile.  It took extra creamer to lessen the bad taste, and I had to keep asking for more creamers (they'd give me 2 or 3 of them at a time, as if they were rationing them).  Later I did get \"fresh\" coffee, but I noticed rather than making an entire fresh pot, they just poured a little water (enough for a cup or two) into the coffee machine, and this time it was as if they used waaaaaay too much coffee and not enough water (I love my coffee strong, but not to the point of unbearable).\n\nMoreover, I remember the friendly and attentive servers from the 1990s and early 2000s.  No more.  I mean they're friendly,  but the service could be a bit more attentive.\n\nBottom line, if you're getting take out and providing your own drinks at home, go for it.  Funny-flavored iced tea and lousy coffee and so-so service won't be an issue and you will get excellent food for sure.  But if you're eating in, go elsewhere (e.g., The Sausage Factory or even Round Table Pizza).", "author": "Tony T."}

Ten minutes later he noticed that we had finished looking at the menus and took our order.  In the meantime we watched 2 tables get seated, have water and other beverages within 2 minutes of being seated.  About a half an hour after we ordered our order finally comes up and has a DIRTY pizza spatula.  We give it back and it was like we had made it that way and somehow it was our fault.  \nWe start eating and it is good but we watch another table get seated and again 2 minutes for beverages and ordering.  We finish drinks and food  and sit there before the waiter comes to see how everything is.  From the beginning we had watched people come in and have drinks and have seen their waitor or waitress several times.  Finally we ask for a bill and a manager.  The manager comes and talks to us and does not seem to care that the utensils were dirty, and that the service was bad.  Fine GIVE US THE DAMN BILL!!!\nWe get out of there and realize if we like their food then we will order it for delivery but never go in again.

So when I went to Pasquale's today with a group of friends, I thought I'd be in for a real treat.  Wrong!  First off, I was shocked by the prices: small pizza is about $11, basic cheese, medium is $14 and so on.  If you want to do half and half, the pricing is different and is based on what each half is comprised of, which seemed a little strange to me.   We ordered three extra-large pizzas which was more than enough food for tweleve people...ended up having about one pizza's worth leftover.  The pizza arrived to our table piping hot, the crust was thin and cripsy, and the cheese melting off in strings.  In the taste department, it was all right.  Just all right.  The sauce seemed a little bland, like it could have used some more oregano, basil, or anything to give it more flavor.  What got me were the puddles (read that: puddles!) of orange oil sitting on each slice of pizza.  I am not a health freak by any means, but oil was literally dripping off the slice when I pulled it from the pan.  I had to take two napkins to blot off the slice before it was eatable.  I noticed others doing the same thing.  Service was all right...the waiter came to check on us occassionally but more or less stayed away.", "author": "Swirls L."}

There burger is also good but there spaghetti and meatballs kind of bland. Stick to ordering it's name sake... pizza, oh wait I lied I tried to baked tortellini and that was pretty good.", "author": "Rachael M."}

Pasquale's didn't disappoint.  First off, the bread is really delicious, and served warm.  I ordered the vegetarian lasagna, which was huge.  The only bad thing was that the edges were hot, but the center not as much.  I don't like that.  One of my girlfriends ordered the fried calamari sandwich, which was HUGE too.  She ate the calamari, but left the bread.  My other friend ordered the 1/2 spaghetti and 1/2 ravioli with meat sauce and meat balls.  It also was HUGE.  Leftovers a plenty.  So, this was awesome:  our server was too damn funny.  She was super friendly and had that \"smoker's deep voice\".  She told us \"3 pretty girls\" that there was a table of \"3 cute guys\" nearby, and that we should meet each other.  Hmmm, a match making server/ restaurant?  Also, we heard her yell at the cook in the back about him forgetting to put something \"on the side.\"  She kept it real.  When she took my friend's plate away, she noticed that she didn't touch her salad.  She asked her, \"Honey, do you wanna take this salad home?\"  When my friend said no, she asked the rest of us, \"Do you want her salad?\"  We declined.  At least she cared about our health and wanted to make sure we got our moneys worth.  To end the meal, she told us what they have for dessert, and they have \"It's It\" ice cream.  Prior to this, I had never heard of this amazing desert.  My friends quickly filled me in.  They had 3 flavors, including spumoni (wow).  Well, maybe I'm totally rambling in this review...  anyhow, overall, this was a lot of fun.  The food was okay, but the service was fun.  And hell, they have It's Its!", "author": "Sarah F."}

It's been wonderful in the past but this time around I'm starting to rethink twice before setting foot in here again. Since I  still love the food I decided not to talk to the owner of the rude service I received by a waitress that merely stuck us in corner and ignored us for the remainder of the night. Two other tables were seated before us and got their pizza first. The waitress (curly haired chick with glasses) didn't bother taking our order until fifteen minutes later. We received our drinks about 20 min later, didn't get an appetizer until much later and noticed that other people had already enjoyed their food by the time we got ours, and we were there before any of them. On top of that, when we did get our pizza I noticed that the cheese was coming right off, which can only draw me to one conclusion; she forgot to put our order in and they made a fast, sloppy pizza to try to cover up her mistake. \n\nDon't get me wrong, the food has been and will  always be excellent. The service sucked (at least this time around). Beware when they stick you  in a corner because more than likely you'll be ignored.", "author": "Alicia A."}

It was every bit as good as the waiter said it would be. The only downside to the whole visit is that there were flies flying all over the place and was very annoying. If you are in the neighborhood, go for it. I saw some of their other dishes go by. They looked pretty good.", "author": "R R."}

I wanted to order a pizza with half mushroom and olives and the other half with ham and pineapple and they wanted to charge for four toppings!  Outrageous!!!  Most pizza places would still consider it two toppings since that's really what is going across the top of the pizza.  I then said to just make it with the mushrooms and ham which would be considered two toppings.  When the pizza arrived, it was luke warm and the pizza had mushrooms all over it with half ham!  My husband HATES mushrooms.  Well I called them back and the person who took the order said I ordered all mushrooms and half ham which I would never do since my husband hates mushrooms.  Anyways he offered to make a small pizza with just ham and I was fine with that.  My husband then said he doesn't want it thinking they'll spit in his pizza so I called them back to cancel the small ham pizza they were going to send over.  Now I'm stuck ordering another damn pizza from a different pizza place becuz of the mistake they made.  I've been a long time customer for many years, but that is going to end as of today.  On top of that, my pizza was burnt all across the bottom so every bite tasted horrible.  What a waste of money.  Not going to order from here again.   Go to Giorgio's instead if you want good pizza and service.  We didn't order from them today only due to them not delivering during the lunch hour (they don't start delivery till 5:00 p.m.).", "author": "Kiki W."}

If you are new to the inner sunset and looking for a good pizza, walk around the corner and check out Milanos.  Pasquales does offer many other food options, and unlike Milanos they accept credit cards, but the food just isn't as good.", "author": "Steve O."}

I have tried other pizzas they have and if you are unimpressed I can see why. Nothing can beat or touch the house special.  Maybe it is becuase this is the pizza I have been eating since I was about 10 but 24 years later it is still the same and still good.Get the house special you wont be......you can't be disappointed.", "author": "Tim L."}

I'm sorry I just can't deal with their horrible phone service/manners anymore. I'm sick of calling and having someone half ass mumble something and then CLICK I'm on hold without even being allowed to say one syllable.  I understand about being busy ( I ran a busy coffee house in downtown SF that had a line out the door every morning). But there is never an excuse for bad service whether over the phone or in person. Also when I finally do get to talk to someone, as I'm placing my order they keep interrupting with \"Anything else...? Anything else...? \"  Geez let me finish my order!!!\nI live literally across the street. Sometimes when I have hung up with them out of frustration, I have walked by and there are like 5 people milling around in service area - why isn't anyone concentrating on the customer service?\nI love there pizza, pasta, and sandwiches and I don't mean for this review to be a whiney message but hoping that it serves as constructive criticism for management. Hell I even dare management to call their own shop and try and place a phone order so they can see what it's like.", "author": "Adrian M."}

I like the crew here and the pizzas are really good and the other dishes are served old style.....big portions at good prices.
