I've ordered from Sushi Fantastic on numerous occasions and their fish was always fresh. I've been picking up Meal Pal here recently and have been quite happy with the food. \n\nPrice wise they are in line with most other FiDi places which is $15+ if you want fresh sushi. I usually get a Chirashi bowl which comes with a salad/soup if I want a variety of fish. Otherwise I'll get one of the rolls when it's offered on Meal Pal.

They both came with lettuce and broccoli.  \n\nService wasn't great, could've been friendlier. \n\nHonestly the interior is rather dirty and not welcoming and I'm surprised they haven't been further inspected by the health department.

This dish came with rice, cabbage, and miso soup.\n\nThe 4 pieces of tempura and Chicken Katsu had a thick outside bread layer which made them very crunchy and flaky. I liked the tempura a lot even though it was very oily. Although the outside layer of the chicken was crunchy, I thought some parts of the chicken were chewy. Not too sure why, but the chicken tasted fine. \n\nThe Chicken Katsu sat on top of the bitter and raw cabbage slices. I ended up dumping tons of cabbage pieces into my miso soup, but I realized it was a bad idea since the soup didn't add much flavor to the cabbage. My friend bought the chicken teriyaki combination, so I ended up dipping the cabbage into the teriyaki sauce.  The cabbage tasted 1000x better after this. If I had Katsu sauce, the cabbage would have probably tasted even better.\n\nThe miso soup did not have a lot of seaweed and tofu. Then again, I dumped a lot of cabbage into the soup, so the cabbage may have overpowered the soup and the toppings too much. I did like how the miso soup was not salty!\n\nThis place has good value and I can picture myself coming back in the future.", "author": "Kristina M."}

Choices of sushi, ramen, bento boxes, and katsu are on the menu, and I tried their Chicken Katsu with veggie tempura.  The Katsu was standard, a tad over breaded and partially bland.  There wasn't any Katsu sauce provided, a huge misstep when serving up the otherwise dry dish.  The tempura was equally overbreaded and while it did come with some dipping sauce to go, the sauce was minuscule and only provided enough moisture to cover half of the tempura order.\n\nService was relatively fast and cheap, as I placed my order and received it in under 10 minutes for around $10.

After reluctantly trying this place again I've got to say I'm impressed. \n\nSushiritto is way down on my list now and Sushi Fantastic is coming back up!!!\n\nWhat's changed. The freshness and quality of their sushi. Their rice game has improved greatly. Sushiritto is so disappointing at the Market street location. They gave me so little fish the sushiritto was gross!!!\n\nI recommend going to Sushi Fantastic now. It wasn't worth going there before but I've changed my mind after a coworker recommended I go try again. \n\nOk so what should you order... I'd recommend the Alaska roll because I'm a big salmon fan and it's only like $6. If that's not enough for you, like me, I'd order the crunch roll also about $5-$6, it has tempura shrimp in it. I've order those two plus a crunch cal roll before for a total of about $17. \n\nOf course if I'm lazy and I'm looking for a variety I'd go across the street to Sushi Fantastic again and again. But if I'm looking for fresh raw sashimi with rice for about the same price I'd go to Grubbies. That's my kind of place :) but I'm glad this restaurant listened and improved their rice. Way to go! I'd definitely come back. In fact, I'll probably go once a week because I love sushi and there aren't many decent places around.", "author": "Kimberly W."}

There's not a lot of Japanese to-go places close to the financial district where I work, so when I'm in the mood for sushi, I settle for this place.

Be warned, portions are on the smaller side and it won't fill you up unless you order more (and by that point your lunch might be closer to $20). \n\nAtmosphere is gross, hence the low rating. It's like stepping into a dim, window-less (the only natural light you'll get is through the door) and dingy basement - not the most appetizing, especially when you're serving raw fish.

It didn't seem very authentic and I was expecting Safeway quality sushi. But wow! It blew my expectations away!! \n\nI had the sushi combo b which includes Nigiri, a California roll, a soup and a salad. I also got a seaweed salad (that was ok). But that combo for $11.95 was SOO good. The fish was soft and melted in your mouth. The California roll was moist and flavorful. I didn't even need soy sauce! This is definitely going to be one of my go to spots for lunch now in the financial district. It's great because you go to the counter to order so you don't have to wait to pay the bill at the end of your meal.

As usual, I was craving Japanese food and as usual, pork tonkatsu. I knew I better eat ASAP as I was getting a hunger headache. I walked on Fremont Street and saw Sushi Fantastic. Great, this will hit the hunger headache spot.\n\nWhen I walked in, it kind of reminded me of a now defunct Japanese restaurant called Oiishi. One can either get takeout/take-away food or eat on the premises. I wisely chose to eat on the premises. If one is eating in, s/he orders at the counter/till and receives a number. The food is brought to the table. \n\nI ordered the tonkatsu lunch and an order of tamago. The tamago was okay, it tasted semi-fresh. Tamago should taste fresh and moist; this one was kind of dry . The tonkatsu was A-OK, it was served with miso soup, rice, and salad. All in all, it hit the spot and killed my hunger headache. My one regret was not taking a photo for the yelp post.\n\nSushi Fantastic shares the restrooms with the other tenants at this location and requires a key. I got lost trying to find the bathrooms in the back of the building before eating. A delivery person I encountered was kind enough to guide me. Now going back was kind of a challenge, it was like being in a labyrinth. Fortunately, I remembered a few signage postings and was able to find my way back.\n\nSushi Fantastic killed the hunger headache.

In fact, it opened today, so I was able to try their still nascent menu. Although they offer udon dishes, rice bowls and bento boxes, the only things they could offer on their grand opening is the sashimi and sushi. They certainly have their priorities right, as it was a joy to have such fresh fish at lunch.\n\nI had their $10.50 Fantastic Bowl, which seemed a bit steep until I saw that I got five fresh, good-sized slices of maguro and five of the salmon over a rice bowl with a few alfalfa sprouts and plenty of tobiko scooped onto the top. It comes with a small salad, which they unfortunately doused with their soy-based dressing (I would have preferred it separately), and a cup of edamame. That's actually quite a bit for lunch.\n\nIt's an industrial-looking space where you climb some steps to get to the actual counter. There are small tables on the ground floor, though I took mine to go. For a first day of business, the service was pretty efficient, even though they had to disappoint many prospects with their limited options. With all the buildings quickly sprouting around this area, I can see this place getting popular with the office crowds.

The delivery person was out the door before we even got everything on the table. When my coworker called to complain, the person at the restaurant said they were \"very busy\" and that they would do what they can.\n\nHowever, the food itself was mediocre at best.

So you're not pulling it from a refrigerated case or having something that was otherwise previously made. The rice was still a bit warm (or maybe just not cold), if maybe a bit gummy. In fairness, I took it to go - so let's assume the rice would have been perfect if I had more time for a proper lunch.  The fish was tasty and of good consistency. \n\nAnother plus is the price. Two hosomaki and a spicy salmon roll ~ $11. Don't judge me on the latter, purists. I'm trying to branch out. \n\nOverall. I'd walk the five blocks it takes to get to Fantastic rather than eat at the food court in my building.", "author": "Damon T."}

I do have to admit that I was a bit hesitant on testing this place out because of the reviews. Both staff persona and food reviews had me guessing. But I gave in being that its literally less than a block from the new office. First round was take out through a colleage. Had the Umekyu & Spicy Sake rolls for about $7.50 all together. Good sized rolls and made for a nice light lunch. Second try was dine in. Prepared to be so rudely treated I was greeted by a very friendly woman with an endless smile. I was instantly put at ease. This time I went for the Fantastic Bowl (minus the tobiko). It was a perfect combo of my two favorite...salmon and tuna. Although a little on the thin side the 10-12 pieces atop sushi rice made for another perfect lunch. It also was accompanied by miso soup & a salad for $13.85. Last but not least we catered in for lunch yesterday & boy was I blown away by the spread! It was so popular by the time I got around to grabbing a plate there wasn't much. Just slim pickins. The sushi was a hit. The gyoza was gooooone. I was lucky enough to come across less than half a try of the teriyaki beef and chicken. I lucked out. I wouldn't normally order these items at a japanese restaurant since I'm a sushier all the way but their teriyakis made me think of it as an option next time. I'm really content with the food this place offers. Prices a buck or 2 more than usual but hey I'm in the FiDi once again.

So my coworkers and I didn't want to wait in the line at Cafe Venue, so we walked a few more steps to this place instead. I ended up getting the sushi combo B, which has 8 pieces of california roll and 6pieces of nigiri. Oh, they also include miso soup and a salad, which most places don't give if you're getting take out. So for the price, it seemed reasonable for lunch. The only thing is, they're all in different packages, so it makes it pretty cumbersome to eat outdoors. \n\nAnyways, I guess about the food. The california roll was actually enjoyable to eat. The fake crabmeat was soft and drenched in some sauce. The sushi was also fresh, unfortunately, since I was sitting in the sun, I think the fish got warm.

Sushi Fantastic opened in the spring of 2007 in what used to be Dogzilla (http://www.yelp.com/biz/6gZSyFUA_f-odUOwm73AGg).  This is a partly fast food Japanese (?) restaurant where you walk up to the upper level, order, pay, grab a number, and find a seat in the lower level.  Sushi started in old Japan as a fast food, so I guess this is fitting.  \n\n100% non-Japanese.\n\nHow could I tell?  Here are the clues:\n- A bottle of spicy hot pepper sauce on each table.\n- American mushrooms in the miso soup.\n- Miso soup comes with a spoon.\n\nFOOD:  Sushi was not Fantastic, but also not deadly.  At their price point, it is unfair to compare them to any of the upscale sushi bars like Ino Sushi or Murasaki.  However, my preference is to eat non-sushi lunch, like $2.50 corn dog at What's Up Dog (http://www.yelp.com/biz/RBFRQwL5lkv6hPCaIP1d0w), rather than eating questionable sushi.  \n\nAs you may know, Sushi in Japan could often get more expensive than sushi in the U.S., so you may wonder how Japanese people deal with sushi cravings without breaking the bank.  \n\nThere are several answers. \n1. Homemade chirashi (bara) sushi.  Often has no raw fish.\n2. Kaiten sushi (boat sushi).\n3. Sushi at grocery stores (like Ito-Yokado or Daiei)\n4. Kozo Sushi (http://www.kozosushi.co.jp/).  \n\nMy favorite inexpensive sushi option in SF is Maruya (http://www.yelp.com/biz/rKxTgHUs7mJwbeVth-rPIg), where I could get Futomaki and Inari sushi (both items do not contain raw fish).\n\np.s.

So, I typically take out. \n\nThe menu is quite diverse. I have mainly tried the sashimi, tempura, and terriyaki combos. The food always comes out piping hot. The chicken and beef tempura lunch combos are quite good. The meats are grilled to perfection and have the right amount of sauce to flavor the meats. The Terriyaki is a little on the sweeter side than I am personally used to though. The Tempura is good, well seasoned and the batter is flaky and delicate; I only wish there was more variety in the vegetables used. The portions are BIG; sometimes I feel overly full with the soup, salad, tempura, meat, rice. But it is great VALUE for the AMOUNT OF FOOD.\n\nThe sashimi is rather expensive, and of an OK quality. I have had much better sashimi, for a much more reasonable price, at other establishments around the city and in the 'burbs.

My wife and I decided to go hear over a lunch hour since it was close and it is was sushi after all. The restaurant takes a minimalist cafe approach with ordering done at the counter (upstairs) with the food delivered to the lower portion which is just a bunch of cafe tables and chairs. Although there are huge billboards that have the menu, they didn't have descriptions (e.g. What really is a Volcano roll?), and we had to look a printed menu which we could get at the counter and then felt rushed. The people taking orders didn't have a good mastery of the menu and could answer a simple question like \"What spicy rolls do you have?\" with out asking others. On a positive note the servers (delivering the sushi) were very nice, quick and helpful. \n\nWe primarily focused on the sushi rolls (not the bento, sashimi, etc.) for which they have a huge selection. Off the top of my head we tried the Kamikaze, Volcano, Rainbow and California rolls and steamed gyoza. First of all each of the rolls is a generous portion with with 8 pieces that are pretty hefty but the higher prices reflect that. Unfortunately the Volcano roll was the only one with any real flavor (and it does pack a kick). I was especially disappointed with the texture of the fish used which was on the soft side and lacked flavor even though in the case of the Rainbow roll it had huge pieces of sashimi on the roll.

(Mention T.E. to me and I'll hatchet you in the face.)\n\nSo when Sushi Fantastic opened, I went in right away to see whether or not my dreams would come true.  I ordered sashimi, chef's choice, and the old stand-bys Spicy Tuna and California Roll.  It costs me $20, but hey, that's sushi.  People who want cheap sushi deserve the meditation time they get on the Porcelain Throne of Regret.\n\nHow was it?  Dream-come-true accomplished.  Their fish is excellent.  The bland rice, the weak wasabi, the terrible salad that came with it - all forgotten in the face of fresh fish.  Hamachi is my easy litmus test for a sushi place, and it was tender and delicious.  Bravo, Sushi Fantastic!  The salmon (sake) is great, the tuna (maguro) is always fresh and tasty, and their spicy tuna has good tuna-scraps in it (unlike most places who just throw in whatever).\n\nThe order was prepared quickly, came in excellent to-go packaging, and the entire serving line was friendly and efficient.  Their sign needs to be replaced, as it's nearly impossible to read as it is brushed steel with glass over it - directly under bright lights - so you cannot read any of it through the glare.  Menus are at the counter, so it's not that big a deal.\n\nAll in all, for this area and for a FiDi luncheon spot - 5 stars!\n\nSUSHI SNOB REVIEW:\nI was really looking forward to a good sushi joint, and found myself satisfied - but not thrilled.  Their ordering system is geared towards the feeding-trough system prevalent all over the FiDi - everything is \"order A, order B, order C.\"  There is a menu, but I had difficulty communicating an ala carte selection, as my order was continually communicated back to me as \"Oh, you want order A?\"  No.  I want hamachi, sake, unagi, and 2 Maguro nigiri orders.  \"Order B?\"  No, just the things I asked for.  \"Order A, then.\"  *sigh* Sure.  Order A.\n\nThe fish is fresh - critical to any good sushi restaurant - but it's maintained in a haphazard way.  I noted fish falling out of the cooler, draped and dangling between the cooler and the counter.  In the hot environment of the kitchen - that's not good.  The fish is pre-cut, clearly to save time and get orders out quickly, but that's going to age the fish as well.  One time I went, the sashimi had clearly been sitting a while and had the sheen that comes with that.  It was still good to eat, but it shouldn't have gotten that far - the cooler must contain the fish and keep it fresh, period.\n\nTheir sushi rice is fine, if a bit bland, but the main chef - friendly, outgoing, and very helpful - is sloppy with making rolls.  I know it's the FiDi lunch crowd and speed is of the essence, but the rolls are haphazard at best and a few seconds of tightening them up would help presentation bigtime.  The salad is baseline, and the dressing is ... equally uninspired.  I often just toss the salad.  The wasabi is white-person grade, so it's about as strong as Spicy Nacho Doritos.\n\nOne oddity is that I get a side of hot rice with my order.  For what?  I don't know.  Rice zen garden perhaps.\n\nAll in all, it's an ok sushi place when compared with other sushi places in the city.  As a big fan of Ino, Blowfish, and Godzilla, all of which I'd give 5 stars, I would have to give Sushi Fantastic 3 stars.\n\nGood, fresh fish is the soul of good sushi - and Sushi Fantastic has it.", "author": "Matt H."}

If Sushi Fantastic is any indication, it's gone the way of the dinosaur. I wish this was something we could resurrect (both truth in advertising and dinosaurs, I'd love to mount a T-Rex with cannons like in Dino Riders.)\n\nSushi Fantastic is by no means a bad restaurant, but the sushi is the worst thing on the menu. The rolls are so-so, and the nigiri isn't fresh. Freshness is the basis of good sushi. I'm not expecting cuts straight out of the Tsukiji Fish market or anything but it shouldn't seem like they've been laying around for a while either. If you want good sushi, there are plenty of other places to go in the city.\n\nThe soba was a sad disappointment. Just because it' is a noodle does not mean it is served the same way as ramen. Serving the soba in a ramen broth base is akin to travesty. It's an entirely different soup type altogether. TO be fair though, I've yet to find anywhere in the States that can make decent soba, which is a shame because it's not very difficult. What I would give to be able to get a box of noodles with dipping soba soup/sauce on the side again.\n\nMisgivings aside, there are some things done very well here. The katsudon (pork cutlet) and tempura are very good. Well cooked and crisp while not being dry, the way it should be. The udon is also pretty good too, and I usually don't like udon (I heard good things so I had to try it, and I'm glad I did.) The service also deserves mention, as they're generally very fast, friendly and clean. Like some of my favorite women.\n\nFood is three stars. Service four. Name two.\n\nSo word to the wise, if you go to Sushi Fantastic, don't go for the sushi. Get a bento box, try a bowl of Udon or some donburi. There's a lot of good to be had by trying more of the menu.", "author": "Keith M."}

I think there is a better value in the nigiri.  \n\nThere is something really weird with the rice.  It tastes... too plain.  I think they neglect to add enough vinegar or any at all.   If anyone in my family forgot the vinegar in the sushi rice, you might as well toss it all into the garbage and then kill yourself. \n\nThe salad has an odd dressing that isn't very tasty and it is garnished with a sad thin slice of tomato and an even sadder dried up slice of carrot.  My coworker said, \"Dang, I just want plain ol' thousand island.  Maybe that would make this edible.  You want it?\"   The miso soup was pretty good.\n\nThey are also still working out the kinks with the service.  Just so's ya know, when you walk in you have to go upstairs and pay. They will give you a number to take down to your table where they will drop off your food.  There is free hot green tea that is self serve.  That is awesome except for the fact that the tea is upstairs while all the tables are DOWN stairs.  Carrying two steaming hot mugs of tea downstairs through a crowd of people waiting to order is pretty sketchy.  They should really move the tea downstairs.  \n\nSushi is ok.  Donburi bowls ok.  I would classify their portions as generous since you do get salad and rice with most of the lunch meals.  It's a nice addition to the area.\n\nHopefully this place will improve once they are producing their full menu.  As of 3/15/07 they are still not serving any noodle dishes or lunch bento boxes.  The only items you can order are sashimi, nigiri, sushi rolls, and donburi.\n\nUPDATE 3/20/07:  Alex the head chef confirmed today that they do have alternative salad dressings, you just need to ask.  He also mentioned that once their kitchen is fully operational in a couple of weeks, they will be having promotions and deals.  I'll definitely check back again and see how the rest of their menu fares.", "author": "Courtney Y."}

I mean if you work in the SOMA slash lower Market/FD area then this is probably the best sushi you can find in a 1.5 mile radius within a $10 - 15 budget. The only other place to get seriously above fantastic sushi is Ozumo but that takes some overtime at work  and drug dealer tactics to afford the bill after a couple of rounds of sashimi, rolls, bento boxes and sake.\n\nAsk the ladies in front when you walk up whats the better lunch special - A, B or C and they'll honestly tell you which one based on what they got that's fresh. I mean A is always the Chicken teriyaki bento box (which in my opinion if you're gonna eat that go to fuckin Jack-in-the-Box on 1st and get your fill). B is usually a special roll with some sashimi and California roll included in. C is the last minute special that always changes every other day.\n\nIf you work in the SOMA, or across the street like me, then this place will be exactly what its name is, Sushi Fantastic.

However, for those of you who work in SOMA, you know what I'm talking about when I say there's a real scarcity of places to grab lunch.  Those folks on the other side of Market don't know how good they have it, what with Chinatown and Northbeach at their backdoor and the convenience of what I like to call the Kearny food fair.  \n\nSushi Fantastic is a relatively new establishment (opened in March).  For a long time they've had tempura listed on the menu, but they don't actually serve it yet (or maybe they do now? Please correct me if I'm wrong).  But that's okay because the sushi and the udon is decent and modestly priced, and, much better than the prepack stuff out there.  However, this is not \"fantastic\" sushi.  Or \"fantastic\" Japanese food.  But it's solid, and I wouldn't expect mind-blowing sushi fare at these prices.  \n\nOne of my favorite things about this place is the Sapporo on tap (surprise, surprise that I seek out the booze!).  The beer always seems to taste like it came out of a fresh keg- aromatic and effervescent with a nice flower on top.  Also, the beef udon is really a star dish here, with beef that is tender and flavorful.\n\nLast but certainly not least, I would also give the staff five stars for their kind, welcoming spirit and good service.

In a nutshell, while I avoid cold (like out of the refrigerator cold) sushi, neither should sushi be WARM. Yes, the avocado and California rolls I am currently consuming could veritably be deemed WARM. At least I'm not eating warm sashimi. \n\nAlso, as I've noted previously, cucumber does not belong in California rolls. Perhaps they think the California roll is a better deal when you get some extra cucumber in it, but I think it's just a rude interruption to the creaminess of the avocado and crab (in this case, artificial crab rather than the real stuff).\n\nAnd finally, I don't think I've ever actually seen rice falling off sushi, but I'm taking it as a bad sign from now on... putting whole sushi rolls in your mouth is not exactly glamorous as it is -- who needs the extra humiliation of little rice globs dropping off mid-plate-to-mouth trajectory?", "author": "J C."}

It's the closest sushi place to my work, so I was ecstatic when it opened. The prices are pretty reasonable ($3.50 for 8 piece CA roll, $4 for 6 piece Rock & Roll, bento boxes are between $7-10). It's pretty similar to Tokyo Express near the Rincon Center (which is the next closest place for cheap sushi). Their rolls are kind of sloppy, but it's fresh, and it's a pretty good size. I always get the Rock & roll, and you can actually taste all of the ingredients in there. \n\nIt's not too crowded at lunch. I've been lucky and only had to wait about 5 minutes for my food.

Second, the iced tea that I purchased for what I would consider a ridiculously inflated price for a snapple was... get this- tepid at best.  Third my spicy california roll came with rice granules falling pathetically all over the plate making it impossible to eat without a spoon.  Hmmm sushi with a spoon?!  Lastly, my Zaru Soba (buckwheat noodles) was overcooked and the \"tsuyu\" or dipping sauce was so salty and no where near what it should have tasted like.
