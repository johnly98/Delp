The Tannous brothers, a Greek Orthodox Palestinian immigrant family purchased the corner store in 1975 and the rest is history.\n\nNot only to they serve hella delicious sammiches to the community, but they have also been a pillar to the community by sponsoring Little League teams, baseball, basketball and football teams at Balboa High School and nearby City College. Not only sports, but they have also sponsored Thanksgiving dinners, Easter Egg hunts, Fourth of July parades and countless other neighborhood activities. \n\nThey are also huge Giants and 49ers fans as their exterior wall has a mural of both teams and the neighborhood as well as their own. Of course the mural is fairly new as it's only been a few years as it din't look this before back in the day.\n\nI have to admit that even though Roxie has been around for ages, I'm a Johnny-come-lately to their sammich scene. It was a co-worker who first introduced me to their sammiches several years ago when he brought some pastrami sammich on Dutch Crunch to work one day as promised. We were talking about where to get good pastrami sammiches and he mentioned this place. I was so impressed that I had to come here myself in person to experience the awesomeness. \n\nIf it's your first time here, just go to the side counter and order from there. It's a popular place so be prepared to wait, especially if it's peak time...which may seem like every hour. The menu is posted on the wall and you can specialize your own custom sammich or choose from their specials. Honestly, you can't go wrong with what you pick as the ingredients are fresh and delicious. They toast everything so if you don't want it toasted, make sure to mention it. You can wait outside or to the side of the store until they call your order and pay at the cash register. \n\nTheir regular sammiches cost $8.99 for a junior, $10.99 for a regular and $15.99 for a supreme. For their specialties, it cost $9.99 for a junior, $11.99 for a regular and $16.99 for a supreme. Seriously, these things are effin' huge and a regular could feed two people and a supreme could feed a village and have enough leftovers for your dog. \n\nThis place is local and legit.", "author": "John G."}

Any time around noon expect a line out the door filled with a fascinating mix of high school students, college students, construction workers, locals, cops, and business people all looking to get one of the best.\n\nAs you walk in, the place is claustrophobic: against the left wall are the fridge cases with non-alcoholic drinks, and behind it some household supplies; against the far wall is the fridge case with the alcoholic drinks, OJ, milk, and a few other items. In the center are snacks ranging from chips, cookies, cereals, etc.\n\nBut you came here for the best sammich - so after walking down the left aisle, you curve around the back and walk past the sandwich counter to the front to order.

I hunted down the original place due to the (temporary or permanent, I'm not sure) closing of the Tanforan location that shared a space with Cinnabon. I was surprised to see on yelp that the Tanforan location had bad reviews that called the original so much better, because every sandwich I've had at the Tanforan location was consistently great. Here, though, maybe I just had one rare bad experience, because most other reviews praise this place, but compared to the great sandwiches at Tanforan the sandwiches from here were so disappointing. On its own it was just average, not great or even good but at least not bad, but with the compared experience of Tanforan I was extremely disappointed.\u00a0\n\nAverage, of course, should be worth 3 stars, and personal disappointment shouldn't be enough to knock off another star, but the prices - holy shit, the prices. I didn't see prices displayed and when they asked what size I wanted and said their largest was footlong, I was thinking why not, it's so good. They rung me up and I found out the sandwiches were 16 each. The price surprised me but, thinking of the Tanforandwich, I thought it wasn't unreasonable. Just half of a small sandwich at the Tanforan location was filling.\n\nI get home, open it, and something looks wrong. It's not pretty, picture-perfect like the Tanforandwich, but that's okay, I thought. As long as it tastes good. Looks rather small though. I guess they pack it lighter than Tanforan. I feel a little overcharged, but whatever. Now for that first delicious bite - what? What is this? This is just a sandwich. Where's the wow? It's so... average. Am I sure this is the right Roxie's? Yes, the employees confirmed it. Oh god, what a waste of money. I've been robbed.\n\nIt's an average sandwich, but those are not average sandwich prices. That's the price of a great or at least really good sandwich, which these aren't. These prices are criminal.\n\nI really hope the Tanforan location isn't closed, because if it is, I lost a really good sandwich place, and this original is no substitute.

Evahhhhhh....\n\nSeriously though, other than some specialty sandwiches that are the best of their category (e.g. po-boys and muffalettas...), these are the all around best sandwiches I've had pretty much ever.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Roxie Special and the Simon Special - both on Dutch Crunch, both \"regular\" size, both with \"everything\" (mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and jalapeno).  The servings are HUGE - we could probably split a regular or maybe a jumbo, to the extent we want the same thing.  I did not need this much food (but we ate it all)...\n\nThe bread was really good, although one of our sandwiches had a bit of a crispier crust than the other....more crispy, more better.  It didn't change my life like it does for some people, but it's good bread, certainly.  The softness of the interior makes it easy to eat, but it's nice to have some texture from the \"crust\" on top.\n\nInterestingly, we each liked one sandwich more than the other (good to keep from getting in food fights!).  He preferred the Roxie Special, which is mortadella, ham, salami, provolone cheese, and artichoke hearts.  I preferred the Simon Special, which is turkey, pastrami, and melted cheddar cheese.\n\nPrices were a little steep, but for how much food we got and how much we enjoyed the sandwiches, I don't mind too much...it was about $9/sandwich.\n\nI think I'd like to come back here and try something a bit more low-key and traditional than either of the special sandwiches - they're both really good, but maybe a little intense for an every time thing.", "author": "Tay H."}

Man was this a different city less than a few years ago, let alone the 25 I have been here.  The place is exactly how you would expect it to have been in the 70s 80s. I do not think a new wall hanging has been put up since. \n\nAnyway, I can't think of many better sandwich places. This is the real deal. Right up there with Deli-board, if you're a newbie to the city.

I had never heard of it.\n\nGrowing up in the excelsior as he did, back when it was almost an entirely Italian neighborhood, Roxie sammies were a steady part of his growing boy rotation.

If I had first consulted the Yelp's Top 100 Places To Eat In America list for 2014 (#43 Roxie), I would not have been surprised.  This is a national list!  Impressive.\n\nMy man then took it upon himself to remedy the sorry situation of my being a Roxie virgin.  He told me to peruse the menu (I did via yelp), & decide what I would like.  Then he would make a Roxie run for us.  I decided on the Simon Special, on dutch crunch bread, w cheddar & everything except tomato.  Toasted.  I love turkey & I love pastrami.  Win win.\n\nThis was a nice & messy sandwich.  The way a good sandwich should be.  If you're not wiping mustard/mayo/dressing/sauce off the corners of your mouth & chin, then there's something not right (same goes for burgers).  The meats were generous & tasty.

As a culinary spendthrift, I find it reassuring to see a hole-in-the-wall outrank a Michelin-starred restaurant on such a motley list. Why else would I patronize a mini-market in the Outer Mission when there are dozens of high-quality sandwich makers closer to my home (photo: http://bit.ly/1ishso8)? Well, that's what I did and convinced Jamie W. to do the same, which was not a hard thing to do because he loves a tasty sandwich like anyone else. When we got there, we saw a couple of guys standing in the doorway obviously waiting for their orders (photo: http://bit.ly/PXUXPG).\n\nWe couldn't quite tell the routine since the sandwich prep area is well hidden. There's a menu on the back wall, but some had no accompanying descriptions (photo: http://bit.ly/1hz4XVv). Dialogue. We needed dialogue. When Jamie asked for a virginal recommendation, there was no hesitation in response...the $9.99 Simon's Special with everything. Turkey breast and pastrami on a big split Dutch crunch wheat roll. The everything part consisted of a liberal slathering of mayo and mustard with lettuce, tomatoes, purple onion rings, pickles and jalape\u00f1o peppers (photo: http://bit.ly/1g3q7vA). I was swayed by the sign next to the lotto ticket stand...the $10.99 Tony's Tri-Tip Special also with everything.\n\nIt was a hot sandwich also on Dutch Crunch with layers of beef squeezed with melted cheddar cheese, mayo , barbecue sauce, tomatoes, onions, jalape\u00f1o peppers and the true kicker, horseradish and lots of it (photo: http://bit.ly/1jq2Asu). Yep, that was genuinely delicious, but I have to give the edge to Simon for making what could be in the running for the perfect deli sandwich. There's no place to sit down and gorge on it although Balboa Park is right across the street. It was raining, so we decided to drive to South Park and take refuge on one of the well-worn picnic tables.

There are pictures of friends and family, loved ones and celebrities that are loyal Roxie's customers. The best pictures are the ones of the kids that started coming here when they were small, and now have grown up and have families of their own that are continuing the tradition of coming here. \n\nCraving a meatball sub? Then the Meatball Mafia is just for you! Or try the staple on the menu, the Roxie Special - (Ham, Mortadella, Salami and Artichokes). There's also the always pleasing Simon Special which consists of Turkey, Pastrami and Cheddar cheese on a Dutch Crunch roll. No matter how you want it, they will make it for you. The Dutch Crunch bread is some of the best in the city, (no disrespect to other bed options that are available) and if you like your sandwiches hot, they will toss it inside of one of the antique ovens cranking out toasted joy. I have witnessed their sandwich craftsmen and women burn themselves, so these things are no joke! \n\nYour sandwich comes out toasted with the cheese melted to perfection. Anytime I am on the Southern half of the city I know where I am heading to get my sammie on! There are plenty of other great items available here such as deviled eggs to ravioli's, macaroni and potato salads. Not to mention a huge selection of drinks and chips.

I was so moved after a couple of bites that I had to just stop and write a Yelp review.  Quickly.  And then returned to eating the rest of my sandwich.\n\nI showed up just a few minutes past 11 am and a line of people formed behind me right after I ordered.  I had read through these reviews but could not believe that a combination of bread, meat, veggies and spread could be so universally praised.  \n\nRoxie's doesn't have the biggest menu.  There were a handful of special combo sandwiches and the rest are your standard build-your-own options.  When you order, state your preference for size (junior (normal sized), regular and supreme (that size can easily feed 3 to 4 people)), bread, cheese, veggies/condiments and whether you want it toasted or not. \n\nI ordered the turkey avocado club sandwich on Dutch Crunch, without mayo.  Quite frankly it didn't need the mayo.  The sandwich was really moist without it.  The bread, oh the bread, let's talk about that bread.  We have to talk about this Dutch Crunch roll.  I've had them before elsewhere but the DC here is like nothing I've ever experienced.  The crust is light, crispy and delicate, almost as if it had been deep fried (it wasn't) and the inside was soft and slightly chewy.

SF natives will tell you,  Roxie's is the spot.  I first moved to the city back in 2005 and this spot was honestly pretty easy to miss because it looks like your average hole in the wall liquor store but  nothing average about it if you ask me. If you hit that place up today, prices have definitely gone up but so has everything here in SF... at least they have a legit sign outside these days lol....so the dudes who make the sandwiches are pretty consistent. Ingredients are always  fresh and The clerk Ader is the MF'n man....he's personable and rocks a dope hairdo these days too. Easy man to get along with.

The lady careful constructed my sandwich as i moved forward to pay for my sandwich.

Let me preface by saying that I'm not much of a sandwich person and I only eat it out of convenience. However, after trying Roxie's sandwiches, I think I've become a convert. \n\nWhat I love and appreciated about Roxie's are the ingredients. Unlike some sandwich places that overdo it with too many complex ingredients and abundance of sauces, Roxie just uses simple, high quality ingredients to make deliciously savory sandwiches.\n\nOn Friday, 7.8.11, my co-worker and I were in offsite meetings when we decided to come by Roxie's to grab a sandwich before heading over to our next meeting. We came in about 1:15 PM and there was short line that moved relatively quickly. I ordered the Junior Turkey Avocado BLT w/ Pepperjack Cheese ($8.49) and it was ready in about 5 minutes. \n\nJUNIOR TURKEY AVOCADO BLT w/ Pepperjack Cheese on Dutch Crunch (Toasted)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HRiP-_TSWvJLy3_hXVRPtw?select=_BwMBe1UdaKKUP0gg8YKVw\nAlthough the sandwiches come in 3 sizes, the junior size was more than enough to settle my grumbling tummy and send me into a food comatose.  \n\nThe Dutch Crunch is what MADE the sandwich; it had a fantastically savory crunch with a slight salty parmesan-like crust. The toasting of the sandwich melted the creamy and spicy pepperjack cheese ever so lightly, melding all the ingredients into one cohesive sinfully delicious bundle. The turkey was soft, tender and the avocado added a rich butteryness while the bacon gave a hint of smokiness. The accoutrements of lettuce, onions, tomatoes, pickles, and jalapenos gave a pop of tangy, sweet and spicy freshness which helped balance the richness. Each bite was sublime and every flavor from the spectrum just BURST in my mouth! \n\nI'm not sure whether I should thank Roxie's or curse at them since eating sandwiches out of \"convenience\" will now be a thing of the past.

Most of us know that this was and still is the hottest business in San Francisco. \n\nOn a gorgeous Saturday afternoon, I met up with my close-friend, who works for SFPD's Ingleside Station. \n\nThe deli/market is also a favorite lunch spot for San Francisco's finest too. \n\nWhen I got there, I was totally lost on where to order my sandwich. So I entered the left side where the cold beverage cooler is located and right off the bat, I quickly guzzled down a bottle of cold fruit-punch Powerade. I also grabbed a bag of \"Dirty\" chips and Arrowhead Sparkling water. I did all this in front of my SFPD friend. \n\n\"Like, what is she going to do? And I don't mind being handcuffed by her too...ooh, baby!\"\n\nFirst she placed her order. And her order is for six of her fellow officer colleagues. Finally, I placed my order and I took the Regular-size BBQ Beef on a Dutch Crunch. For $7.99, I get a fat slab of slice beef drenched in BBQ Sauce, choice of cheese (I took Swiss), and the usual sandwich condiments.  \n\nI got to tell you, that sandwich was \"edible-incredible\"! The thin slice of meat was very tender and tasted well with the melted Swiss cheese. The sauce was sweet with a little spiciness. And the Dutch-crunch roll had a crunchy explosion in every bite. \n\nI owe my friend a lot in turning me on in finding this place. \n\nMy long years of anticipation of coming here have finally ended. And my return for another trip back and try more of the shop's tasty sandwiches will be very soon. \n\nThe shop also sell 40 ounces beer.

C'mon people there are so many better places out there. This was my first and last trip to Roxie's. All I ever heard was \"oh you gotta go to Roxie's it's the best\" and \"YOU HAVENT BEEN TO ROXIES?!?\"  \n\nWhen I peaked over the high deli counter to find a young woman popping her gum while listening to her music in one ear and my sandwich order with the other I was initially turned off. I asked for 2 turkey sandwiches. One with pepper jack and Avo, the other with cheddar and no mustard. The girl said \"you want it hot right?\" And after telling her I would like it cold I drew a look of disgust out of her. At that moment I was still waiting to judge this place on the sandwich itself. \n\nI grabbed 2 sodas and went to the register to settle up. The guy asks what I ordered. I said the 2 cold turkey sandwiches. He says ok that'll be $38.00.....\nWHOA! 38 DOLLARS? He said \"yes, supreme sandwiches are $15.00\". When I ask for a sandwich and don't specifically ask for supreme you should probably make sure that's what I want before making it. $15 for a sandwich means this better be the best sandwich that's ever been made. \n\nNow on to the worst part of the whole experience.... \nTHE SANDWICH. it was a ton of low quality ingredients sloppily spread inside a foot long crumbly Dutch crunch roll. You would've thought I ordered an onion sandwich and asked to add Turkey. $15? You can charge a dollar fifty for this sandwich and it would still be a rip off. They probably make about $14.00 on every \"Supreme\" sandwich they make. I didn't know that \"Supreme\" meant taking the crap you put on your regular sandwiches and double it. I have about 3/4 of each sandwich left. I couldn't get my dog to eat any so maybe I'll be able to swindle the birds in the park to eat the rest.... Maybe. \n\nSince I stated there are better places to go I would recommend taking your business to Clancey's on Irving where you'd get 5 times the quality for half the price and astronomically better service.", "author": "Nick M."}

Their toasted pastrami sandwich is 4 stars worthy. But remember to check your order before leaving the store. Twice they've screwed up my orders. On my latest visit, they forgot to put avocado in my \"BLT with avocado\". \n\nThe sandwich making operation is hidden by a tall wall of bagged chips/snacks and wood paneling (what are they trying to hide?). Other sandwich shops use glass instead. Then I probably could have seen when they missed the avocado on my sandwich instead of finding out when I got home. Urgh! \n\nService is usually semi-cordial (I would not describe it as friendly), but that's offset by the value of having freshly made sandwiches until 9pm in this remote area. Nearby Deli World (which I already reviewed in prior weeks) closes at 5:30pm.\n\nSandwiches come in 3 sizes: junior, regular & super. The junior ($5.99) would satisfy most appetites. \n\nPros: \n- Affordable pricing \n- Open late (until 9pm) \n- Good variety of sandwiches with many meat choices\n- Bread selection: 8 bread rolls and 3 sliced breads (Deli World only has 1 bread type) \n- No extra charge for toasting the bread (Deli World charges extra for hot food) \n\nCons: \n- Price is $1-$2 more expensive than nearby Deli World on Ocean Ave. \n- Greasy hair sandwich makers that behave and talk like some gumbas from NY \n- You cannot see how they make your sandwich \n- Staff mistakes, last time they forgot to put avocado in my \"BLT with avocado\"\n\nMy latest food pics: \n\n- Pastrami on dutch crunch roll - really good stuff! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HRiP-_TSWvJLy3_hXVRPtw?select=IFA6dy6YJHqToj64Axs4Og \n\n- A \"BLT with avocado\" that's MISSING the avocado!!! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HRiP-_TSWvJLy3_hXVRPtw?select=eR7ErTjQpINLyij4TiYSWw \n\n- Potato salad was okay (flavored with curry, eggs, olives, pickles).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-11-08", "description": "Understanding that this review might upset some Roxie Food Center fans, this is a classic example of why Best of Yelp is dysfunctional.  For weeks in fall of 2006, Roxie Food Center has been NUMBER 1 in restaurants category (with zip code set in downtown SF) (See pic).  Are you telling me that Roxie out ranks all other restaurants as the best restaurant in the area?  The best among 5000 restaurants rated in the area?\n\nBeing a food nerd, I drove from SOMA to Balboa Park area just to check out the heavily raved Roxie's sandwiches on Dutch Crunch bread.  As you can see from the pics I've posted, the place is very much like any old mini-mart/liqueur store with a counter for sandwiches.  Inside, there was limited space to walk around.  The customers in line to order, people waiting for their sandwich to be made, and people waiting to pay the cashier, were all mixed up like a chaotic zoo.  Don't go here if you are claustrophobic.  \n\nSANDWICH:  I sat there gravely puzzled at my inability to see the greatness in Roxie's sandwiches.  I trust Yelpers, so I knew that 39 Yelpers could not be wrong, so I knew the problem must be with me.  Bread was good, but I think ACME Bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz/I19ntZQrZxMn9gYOOK1rhg) and Boulangerie Bay Bread (http://www.yelp.com/biz/tQE4SPlX9ZlFSbF4JPU4pg) is better.  Pastrami was o.k., but ones at Miller's East Coast Delicatessen (http://www.yelp.com/biz/4NInBK_67cLRyUS7sq0CEg) is significantly better.  Turkey was average at best, better ones at Tommy's Joynt (http://www.yelp.com/biz/0YPcBWiU-8t2kGe-DOhW5g) or even at Lee's Deli.  Roxie's meat quality was no better than what I get at Safeway.  \n\nSummary:  Roxie is a good neighborhood sandwich shop.  However, they do not have the best sandwich in the city, and for sure it's not the best restaurant in Yelp.  Grab a sandwich at Guerra Quality Meats (http://www.yelp.com/biz/jK1_pM6U50seuco7Tvhing), grab one at Roxie, compare the two, and let me know if Roxie Food Center should be #1 on Best of Yelp.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

The way they make their sandwiches is done with such art and papering! Roxie Special is my favorite. It is basically all the different deli meats put into one sandwich. Their DUTCH CRUNCH BREAD is the THE BEST!. Crunchy outside and soft on the inside. \n\nCons: They take about 7-8 mins per sandwich. I recommend ordering over the phone and its about 15 mins till its ready for pick up. The prices have gone up in the past 10 years. Regular order will run about $8. At this quality it is still well worth it. \n\nRoxie's and Little Lucca's are my favorites sandwich spots. I like they for two separate reason. Lucca's is a sandwich you want to get your nasty on!

My bf called 10mins prior and when we got there we guess they forgot our order but no biggie.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-03-23", "description": "Ok I feel bad doing this but I'm hoping that maybe the owners might possibly see this and take note. I've been getting the same sandwich from here for 8 yrs. The last 2 times I went to Roxie's it wasn't good. The sandwiches just aren't the same. The avo is never perfectly ripe the way it always used to be, the bread breaks apart and there is significantly less turkey in the turkey avo. My friend and I both noticed that they just weren't as yummy last time. Today I went in and they had this guy on the register who I'd never seen before and he didn't know the price of ANYTHING, working at a snail's pace he would quietly ask other ppl prices and if they didn't respond he would wait for agonizingly long and then ask quietly again. I waited for 20 mins, my sandwich was just sitting there getting soggy and cold while this guy helped ONE GROUP of (stupid lameass) girls. Once I get home and FINALLY get to eat my cold mushy sandwich THERE'S MUSTARD ON IT. That was literally the ONLY specification I made. My order was suuper easy! Turkey avocado on Dutch crunch, Swiss, no mustard. The guy even said \"u want everything?\" And I said \"I do not want mustard so everything except for no mustard\". Ew. Mustard and avocado do not belong together. Mustard just dominates the whole sandwich and ruins the buttery smoothness of the avocado. On top of all that, I'm practically positive they are using a different kind of Swiss cheese. It's got a more pungent and sweet and aggressive flavor and weird texture.", "author": "Emma H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-29", "description": "My coworker would seldom stop by this place to buy one of their sandwiches for breakfast and would offer to get me one as well. Sure why not, skipping breakfast is a big nono.\n\nSo I've been trying their turkey sub with the dutch crunch bread, pesto, pepper jack cheese, and everything else. It's bigger than a Subways 1 footer, and heavier too. This thing definitely packs a punch, and while I'm rarely able to finish it all for breakfast, I was not \"satisfyingly\" filled up. It lacks something, and has too much of something else.\n\nFirst of all, I think the downfall of this sub is the bread. The dutch crunch packs too much flavor that it overwhelms the lettuce and tomato. It goes well with the pesto and cheese, but that also caused it to almost completely wipe out the turkey meat's flavor. When I eat a sandwich, I rely on the flavor that comes with the veggies and meat mostly, so it's a bit strange for me to have the condiments and bread be the dominant one. \n\nSecond, again with the bread, it's either too hard or crunchy. Sticking this shit in my mouth pretty much engulfs all the other ingredients. Everytime I chew, I chew mostly the bread first, and the rest of the insides get \"mixed\" with the bread; you don't get to chew those individually. Don't get me wrong - their bread isn't bad, but a sandwich shouldn't be focused so much on the bread. What do you think of when you eat a Big Mac, a Whooper, or Big Jack or whatever the hell you call those? Exactly! The meat and the veggies! You don't eat those then think \"oh wow, the buns sure were good!\" \n\nLastly, again with the sauce, it's a bit overwhelming. I just opened up the remaining of the sub to confirm this - EVERYTHING is drenched with the sauce. My turkey is white-green from it, my lettuce is white-green from it, the tomato / onion is white-green from it, the inside of the bread is white-green from it... you think you get the picture? Well picture THIS - it's like someone did a skeet skeet into my damn sandwich yesterday and now it's starting to mold. That's fucking nasty man! What sick fuck would even have the appetite to eat this now? In my opinion, sauce shouldn't be this heavy where it covers the flavor of all the other ingredients. So when I bite down on the bread, all the other ingredient squishes out... and they're ALL drenched with the sauce. If I'm not tasting the exterior of the bread, I'm tasting the interior which consists of nothing but sauce.\n\nSo in conclusion, I do think this is a filling sandwich, but as a breakfast sandwich, it felt \"unsatisfying\" because I usually expect something more \"fresh,\" like fruits, veggies, something mellow and soft, unlike the heavy bread / pesto flavor. There's too much heavy flavor in this sub, and I conclude that this would be better off as a late lunch - dinner type of meal.", "author": "Calvin D."}

The Dutch Crunch has been hyped up in San Francisco 7x7 and it does live up to the hype.\n\nMy faves are the Tri Tip and the Chicken.  Sanwiches are also heated up in an oven. Debit friendly .

Fresh veggies and just the right amount of warmth from the oven to make it melt in your mouth.\n\nIt's a corner market, so no seating and a bit claustrophobic while you wait for your food but Balboa Park is right across the street.

My nose drew me in on a Sunday afternoon, an odd hour (between lunch and dinner) and yet, there was a small crowd waiting for sandwiches.  Most of them ordered the meatball sandwich, so I decided to try it as well.  I learned a little more about the rolls there.  Spanish is their softest roll and it's sour.  I went with the Italian roll which is soft and toasts up very nicely.\n\nMmm, what a meatball sandwich (Jr: $5.99, Regular: $7.99).  They are so good at toasting their sandwiches.  The outside was very hot and toasty.  The bread was lovely and crispy on the outside while still soft inside.  The bread to fillings ratio was spot on.  The delicious meatballs flecked with generous amounts of parsley weren't too firm or too soft.  They came doused in a lovely zesty tomato sauce.  The sandwich came with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickles, cheese (your choice, I chose mozzarella) and jalapenos.  The veggies were fresh and unlike many places, they didn't go crazy with condiments.  While the sandwich was messy, the bread didn't get soggy.  They know how to construct a flavorful, balanced sandwich.  Everything melds together into a gooey (but not soggy), scrumptious mess.\n\nThis is one fine sandwich, one of the very best in SF.  Get one in honor of National Sandwich Month (August).", "author": "Lolia S."}

I ordered the tony's tri tip special and my boyfriend ordered the turkey sandwich. \n\nSo I'm giving this place a one star because, the tri tip special was not good, the barbecue sauce was over whelming and drenched. I took a few bites and had to trade with my boy friend for the turkey sandwich that didn't taste all that awesome for a sandwich that cost almost $10.

The Simon Special, Roxie Special, and Meatball are also great!  To be honest, I haven't tried a sandwich there that I didn't like.\n\nI think what makes Roxie irreplaceable is that it has been making sandwiches for over 30 years (probably a lot longer than that).

They even toast it free of charge (or, if they charged, I didn't notice cause it was SO CHEAP!). My food was good, but awkwardly places. I started on the low-meat end and was thinking \"that's sure a lot of extras\" until I got past the 1/2 way point and realized...OH. Here's my MEAT!  Not sure how I liked that surprise. If I started on the other side, I'd be going \"Hey, where'd my meat go?!\"\n\nSo I've heard of Roxie's, and came in one day to try it.  Stupid me...stood at the front of the line for a minute. OHH...so I go AROUND the two aisle corner store to the frozen area as the \"start\" of the line. Really wish I skimmed through other reviews so I didn't look like a doof.  Meh.\n\nI go up...and had my order pre-planned. They were super nice and got my order out pretty quickly. Good thing about them - they actually go in order. Like, the guys behind the counter are synced so that if you ordered first, you get your order first (weirdly, not like this everywhere!).  The regular is HUGE. Order it if you're hungry. If you're at an average sized eater, go for the small. If you're Texas sized...go for the big one. It looked HUGE (as viewed by me looking at what I assume to be the entire CCSF basketball teams order. Dayam).\n\nLine wasn't too bad, about a 10 minute wait. Parking is available outside, which is a plus.  No need to circle the block, cause a lot of people actually drive here to get food!  There's no place to sit and eat here, so come on a sunny day and walk to Balboa Park (or...that park by the Balboa Swimming pool). \n\nThey do pre-orders over the phone, so if you're REALLY anxious to get it and go, then order in advance. Its not a bad wait though...at least not for me.  Roxie's, I would normally give you a 3.5, but for the good service and decent food (and the fact my sandwich stayed between the bread), I'll give you a 4 on yelp.  3.5 in my mind though.", "author": "Lily W."}

We paid $23 for two regular sandwiches and a bag of chips. Personally, I would probably stick with Monterey Deli on Monterey where I feel like overall it's a better value, but i'm willing to try Roxie's once more for good measure (see below).\n\nI was debating between 3 and 4 stars but 3 stars just seems too low!\n\nAnyway, we got a turkey on dutch crunch, and also a hot roast beef on dutch.\n\nThe turkey on dutch was good but I felt like there weren't enough fixins. The dutch crunch bread was fresh. I ordered it with 'everything' (except for jalape\u00f1os). As I started eating it, I decided I didn't want the tomatoes after (nothing wrong with them but I just wasn't in the mood). So I removed them and immediately realized that the sandwich had a lot of turkey, and a lot of mayo which drowned out everything else -- which there wasn't a lot of. I couldn't help but feel like it was missing something. And mind you, I opted for salt, pepper, oil and vinegar. That said, I would be willing to try Roxie's again but would probably order something else -- OR, add avocado to my turkey sandwich ask that they go light on the mayo.\n\nThe hot roast beef sandwich was very good. No complaints there. \n\nThe workers were very, very friendly -- cracking jokes, being pleasant and thanking people for their business.\n\nDownsides: parking can be a bit challenging. Had to park 1.5 blocks away and it's a very, VERY tiny market deli. When you wait for your sandwich to me made you're basically blocking the aisle.

Well, the Simon Special has both turkey & pastrami on dutch crunch bread, all the trimmings that you want, cheddar cheese AND I always add avocado to it because I am a slave to it!! Ha!   \n\nThe only reason why I didn't give Roxie's a 5 star rating is because at times, they will mess up on your order, due to the fact that they are so busy. For example, today, I went in and ordered a Simon Special with avocado, no onions, no pickles... To my disappointment, it had NO avocado and  they put onions and pickles!! THANKS!!!! Nevertheless, it was still a great sandwich and I ate it all! My tummy was happy and that's all that he wrote!", "author": "Cesar N."}

It is a deli, so most people have a go to deli sandwich but it's nice to try to check out their specialty sandwiches. Overall this didn't bother me at all.\n\nThe counter is pretty high up so you can barely see them make the sandwich and it can be hard to communicate with the person making yours too. There was a line, but it moved pretty quickly. Anytime you're going somewhere for the first time a line is a good thing. shows you people actually go here and gives you time to check out the menu before you utter those infamous words, \"So what would you suggest\"\n\nI find the price a bit much. I got a regular which was a good size.  I forget the exact amount but I paid around $12. I don't know their costs but I've had other deli sandwich shops of equal quality for a few dollars less.

Huge too!\n\nAfter having ordered my sandwich, I waited with the others in the narrow aisle of the store.  I thought I heard my name called (hey, it was an honest mistake), so I went up and the guy working the register talked down to me and said, \"Calm down sir, slow it down, it's not your sandwich.\"  Hmmm, getting clowned definitely takes the yum factor out of a meal.\n\nAnyway, per tradition, I ordered mine without vegetables or other extras.  For me, a meatball sandwich should be just that...cheese, meatballs, sauce, and bread...a virtual pizza sandwich and this one did not disappoint.  The Simon looked really good too.", "author": "Roy N."}

My very first sandwich ive had from there was a Hot roast beef with porvolone cheese on DUTCH CRUNCH. simply amazing!! I havent ordered anything different for as long as ive been going there.  I've tried other sandwiches that other people have ordered but its not as perfect as the roast beef.  \n\nIts not the thin ass roast beef you buy from the grocery store, this stuff is legit. all the fixin's are perfect then they put it in a toasted that smooshes it a little. omg. again, simply amazing. \n\nit really is a mini corner grocery shop that has a lot of everything. chips, drinks, candy, alcohol, meds, cheese, eggs, milk even. hahaha, i never get any of it except drink n chips w my sandwich. \n\nfamily owned and everyone who helps out are nice.  i always call my order in on my way there from san jose (roxies is usually my first stop into the city). and stop by and pick it up.  there is usually a good amount of people ordering there too so its best to call it in. \n\na perfect sandwich if you love flavor and texture. enjoy.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

In this review that missing star is due to the very limited space once you enter the shop.\n\nThis shop around the corner has been around since the beginning of time but their sandwiches are timeless. Turkey, roast beef, or pastrami on Dutch crunch with American cheese, TOASTED (please pass the towel, I'm drooling) are just a few of my personal favorite. Throw in the Arizona Ice Tea and some Sun Chips, 30 mins later and I'm ready to go to sleep.\n\nNow the shop itself is great. Great people, authentic look, car & nudy magazines (if your into that), and some grocery needs. But the cramp area, with the usual tons of customers, not to mention the very limited parking makes it challenging. It's not exactly like McDonald's drive thru but the food is a million times worthy. So if your in the Ingleside district in San Francisco hit this corner of San Jose and San Juan Ave for an awesome Roxie sandwich!", "author": "Mel B."}

I mean, I really only always get the same thing each time... Salami on Dutch Crunch with american cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo & jalapenos. But still. I've really never tried anything like it.\n\nSO freaking delicious. \n\nOh and it has to be toasted. If you don't get it toasted then you haven't really experienced this magical sandwich at its true potential! \n\nMy friend lives literally across the street from Roxie's so every time I'm at her house I try and take advantage. Or sometimes I go to her house just so I can have someone to eat my Roxie's sandwich with. She understands. Oh yeah and as a regular there for most of her life she taught me to always try and phone your order in, or else you'll be standing around for about 15 minutes or so.. Which is not really fun because that place is tiny, so you are kind of forced to wait outside. I mean, unless standing on street corners is your thing then you should be cool.", "author": "Riza E."}

Their pastrami and roast beef are also amazing, and they have a plethora of freshly sliced deli cheese options. And there's no skimping on meat here. They slice all their cold cuts fresh on the spot. You only need a Junior to fill you up - a regular will feed two people...or one really hungry one.\n\nEven their house spaghetti is awesome - sprinkled with parmesan and drizzled with ground beef crumbles.\n\nBuying a sammie here is an experience in itself. You walk in, and the lowrider mags (i.e. nudie mags) are front and center. Aisle are super narrow, so there is only room for a single file line all the way around the store. And there is ALWAYS a line - proof that the place is amazing.\n\nI often end my visits to Roxie's by sitting in the car and diving face first into my sandwich. Because anyone who's bought a sammie here before can tell you...there's no worse torture than smelling warm dutch crunch on turkey on your car ride home and not being able to take a bite.\n\nOh, one last tip - since the place is always packed, just call your order in and you can pick it up and pay at the register.\n\nRoxie's, I totally love you.", "author": "Mariela D."}

Roxie's?  \"What?!?  You haven't  heard or had a Roxie's sandwich before?!\"  he shouted.  Nope, so that's how it started. \n\nWe went to Roxie's the very next day since it was so heavy on mind about this \"great sandwich\".  Driving up to the place I was in total disbelief.  A LIQUOR STORE?!?!?!  Are you kidding me?!?!?  The best sandwich in the Bay Area is coming out of a liquor store!  Paaallllleeeeezzzzzeeee!  Give me a break already.  (getting ready to put my foot in my mouth).  Stephanie trust me he says.\n\nOkay so, walking inside there wasn't anything different from any other liquor store.  It was small, crowded, chips, cigarettes, lotto, etc.  Then I see the menu for sandwiches on the wall.  So, I looked at the menu and inquired about the Roxie's Special (mortadella, ham, salami, artichoke hearts and jalapeno's).  Sounded good to me so I ordered the regular size on an extra sour hard roll with provolone heated with everything.  OMG  YUM YUM YUM!  I couldn't believe how good this sandwich was.  It was humongous, tasty and the bread was just right!  This was the perfect sandwich.  The flavor of the meats and condiments were married together perfectly.  \n\nSooooooo, what happened next?  I went back the following week and ordered another sandwich!  LOL.  I'm hooked!  \n\nOverall, this place is a winner in my book.  Yes, it's crowed because of all the people ordering.  Yes, it does take some time for you to receive your sandwich after you order it.  BUT, it is well worth the wait, TRUST ME!    After all, good things come to those who wait!  OMG!  Delicious things at that!  \n\nBelieve it or not, a liquor store that makes the best sandwiches in the bay area!

It's easy enough to find but you wouldn't expect it to have a deli inside. \n\nEveryone there is super friendly and chats it up with you while they're making your sandwich. There was no other customers there when I went to order my sandwich but it still took a good 5 minutes for them to make my order. I got the Simon Special (recommended by the people there) because it was my first time. I asked for pickles and jalapenos on the side but in the end I never got them. It's alright though. \n\nPrices are reasonable compared to Ike's. For $12.99 I got a Supreme, which was basically 2 decent sized sandwiches. Plenty for me and my boyfriend. Roxie's will accept credit cards for orders of $10 or over. The Simon Special was on Dutch Crunch and filled with ham, pastrami, and the usual fixings. The sandwich was a little on the salty side in my opinion because of the pastrami. There also wasn't a good distribution of meat along the whole sandwich. My boyfriend's half had barely any meat in it while mine got the bulk of it. The cheese was nice and toasted in the sandwich and the bread was nice and crunchy.\n\nOverall, an excellent, friendly place to grab a reasonably priced sandwich.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I still see some of the original staff making my sandwiches.  My usual order is (drum roll) a regular turkey with provolone on extra sourdough bread, everything but pickles and heated up!  You MUST get it heated up.  So they put a secret sauce (I think it's olive oil, pepper, garlic, and other heavenly ingredients).  Hella good!  \n\nRecently I've been ordering the turkey club, which is equally tasty to my usual order.  I LOVE this place.  It brings back memories of back in the day.  It's better than Ike's and the crowd has more people of color, which is another reason why it's an SF landmark.  I only go to the original location, which is a corner store by Balboa Park.  Can't wait for my next Roxie's sandwich!  It's more than 5 stars!", "author": "Chad A."}

Anywhere else is a place just because you couldn't get into Roxies.  I like to mix it up with the BBQ beef on soft, the simon's special on dutch, and lately on  Friday's the tuna sandie.  You can call in your orders too but don't make it too close to lunch hour unless you want to watch a line wrap around Santa Ynez and into Balboa Park!  This place is original SF, not frills, no thrills, strictly business.  And don't even think about not having your order ready once you're up or no sandie for you haha.  So go ahead and treat yourself to an SF original, you will not be disappointed.  9/10 customers have been going there since they were kids, including me so their clientele of Roxie faithful loves our little sandwich spot secret.

Plus it is on San Jose street just off the Ocean exit on 280 where it should be more residental than anything else. Wouldn't have found it, but thank goodness for google maps.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I like this place.\n\nIt is very crowded in there as there are basically two aisles when you walk in. The aisle furthest from the door is where the magic happens.\n\nThere are two sandwich dudes behind a very high deli bar and an older lady that you can barely see the tops of her head strolling back and forth.\n\nAt the end of the deli bar is a meat slicer with a chunk of meat being sliced into thing slivers by itself and unattended. Interesting.\n\nAsked sandwich dude which one to get and he said either the Simon or the Roxie Special. Fortunately, I had my trustworthy eating buddy with me and we got one of each. They have sizes from Junior, Regular to the Supreme. The Regular looked like the footlong while the Supreme was probably pushing 18 inches. Not that you need to ask, but I went Supreme all the way...the addage of go big or go home.\n\nThe sandwich maker offered to make it to what he thought was good. The Roxie was made with sourdough. The Simon was made with Dutch crunch.\n\nHands down the Simon was the better of the two. The Simon had a more distinct flavor of meats and were easier to distinguish flavors from.\n\nThe Roxie had a nacho cheese flavor to it with Jalapenos, but the sourdough didn't do it for me. Should have got it on dutch crunch as well.\n\nEither way, that is a lot of sandwich to eat. But for ~$13 a piece that isn't too bad. \n\nThis place wasn't as good as Ike's place, but the concept is basically the same. I actually think the bread was not as fresh as Ike's but still solid. \n\nThe guy behind the counter is very quick, funny and just all around pleasant. The family memorabilia and pictures add to the charm.\n\nIt's good stuff and would love having a sandwich again if in the area.", "author": "Andrew C."}

I am going to have leftiovers for two days!\" that is exactly what will happen when you get a Roxies sandwich, but no matter how hard you try, you WILL eat the whole thing. You deny it now, but you will. \n\nRoxies reminds me a lot of the small shabby delis in New York. There is no glitz or glamour to the place which makes me like it even more.  Prices are totally fair and you will be full for quite some time.\n\nThe sourdough and dutch crunch are delicious! And I highly recommend getting everything on it. The veggie sandwich is one of the best in the city.  The guys who run the place are nice and efficient! \n\nDefinitely a great place to grab a sandwich before you hit the beach/ball game or just because you are too freaking tired to cook dinner.", "author": "Jean K."}

I personally order the Junior roast beef sandwich all the time. SO GOOD. I love everything about this sandwich, everything from its delish bread to the savory meat. I've been here about ten times, everytime I order the roast beef sandwich. Next time, I need to try their other sandwiches, which I'm sure will be just as awesome. \n\nSo conclusion here, don't judge a book by its cover (or I guess the appearance of the store) or else you could miss out on something truly awesome!", "author": "Richard W."}

After walking into the designated ailes, i got myself a drink and chips and ordered my sandwich. I forgot what i ordered because i didn't order it. The owner recommended it to me. The name of the sandwich sounded like it came from an italian mob or something. Whatever it is, It was delicious.

If you're not having a good day, tell the owner Tony to tell you a joke. He got jokes for days.\n\n5 stars to the best sandwich i ever ate at.

I ordered the biggest Pastrami with Swiss on a Dutch Crunch that was baked to perfection.  \n\nBeing that this is a corner store, I was able to purchase some drinks and some chips go along with my sandwich.  Bought a beer and a Fanta Strawberry, but in all honesty I should have just stuck with the beer  but I'll save that bit for later.  \n\nThe price came out to almost $20 because the sandwich alone was about $11 along with the rest of the things that I got.\n\nSo I get home and am about to enjoy my beautiful sandwich, I open the wrapping and feast my eyes on one of the more well put together sandwiches I've seen in a while.  \n\nI open up my soda which happens to be a Fanta Strawberry and just my luck, it explodes and leaks ALL over my sandwich.  I'm sure that my sandiwich is ruined now and am severely disappointed but I still eat the sandwich and find out that this strawberry infused masterpiece is still delicious and one of the better sandwiches that I've had.  \n\nSo to say that my strawberry soaked Pastrami sandwich was still one of the better sandwiches that I've had is to say a lot.  I can only imagine what it tastes like without the Strawberry soda.  Overall the place is great and have lots of condiments and a lot of meat packed into a sandwich.

This place might look sketchy to some who drive by, and it certainly doesn't look like they would make such a great sandwich. But like the old saying goes, \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" Parking can be a hit or miss depending on how lucky you get and what time of the day it is. There's usually gonna be some people ahead of you, but that's to be expected cause it's delicious! Their Dutch crunch bread is off the hook! I didn't  even know that kind of bread existed until I stumbled upon this place with my ex on a cold, rainy SF afternoon in the dead of winter. \"Do you want it toasted?\" asked the guy behind the counter with slicked back hair. Heck yeah! It makes a world of difference how they toast the bread. I have only tried their Roxie Special (without onions) but it's so good that I almost don't wanna stray to another choice. I'm not a fan of jalape\u00f1os but Roxie makes me love it in my sammich! With the cheese all gooey and drizzling over the salami and ham. YUM. Every friend that I've introduced to Roxie has fallen in love with the sandwiches, my parents love it too, what more can I say?\n\nI love the neighborhood vibe of this place;  it's a hole in the wall and not pretentious. It's cramped, it's a liquor store. Everybody is really friendly. I love the guy who rings you up haha. But inside that candywrapper-like packaging lies the key to my happy food coma.

The neighborhood may not be as scenic and not close to DP (which is where you eat your Sunday sandwich), but you won't regret your trip here (besides you'll be back at DP after having found parking before Ike's will have your order). \n\nAlso, the owner of the shop is a very cool guy and sells those strange sweets you thought you'd only find in the old country (you either know what I'm talking about or you'll never know).\n\nThe moral of the story is to go to Roxie's and get any sandwich with everything and heated, then head back to DP to eat it.

They have been around for more than twenty years and even the police and city workers come here to get their regular fix.\n\nIf you want to try one of the best-tasting Dutch crunch sandwiches, come here!  Make sure you ask the sandwich makers to toast it.  During lunch hours, the wait is long, so call in your order 15 minutes ahead.\n\nAlthough the sandwiches here are smaller than the legendary Little Lucca's in South San Francisco and costlier than legendary Ike's Place in San Francisco, this place is worth trying.  Please be warned that you may be hooked.\n\nMy favorites are still the Samoan Mafia (meatball sub with sour cream) with avocados and the chicken avocado sandwich with BBQ sauce.  Best to eat it when the bread is crispy and warm.  So delicious when the cheese is melted along with the meat.  You will see a lot of regulars who eat in the car, since there are no tables and chairs.\n\nThe junior size sandwich is the smallest choice (about $8 for 8 inches).  They have an interesting way of securing the sandwiches: the wrap ends are twisted instead of using a rubber band or tape.\n\nThe service here is casual, while the store is cramped with many items, like chips, drinks and convenience items.  Prepare to hold your tummy in when other people try to go past you on the aisles.\n\nYou definitely see some local flavors here.   Tony, who usually mans the cashier, is a friendly smart-ass, while the sandwich makers look like harmless gumbas from NYC.\n\nOne time, a regular customer comes in and cracks a comment about the girlie magazines in the front rack.

Oh, and toasted please :)  Now, THAT's a sandwich made in Heaven...\n\nI don't have to be a professional food critic or food connoisseur, nor do I have to travel the globe, to know when I've found a really great sandwich.  Even to call Roxie's sandwiches \"great\" is an understatement.  Their sandwiches are exquisite, one of a kind, phenomenal, out of this world.  No sandwich in the nation - maybe even on the planet - can compare.  Maybe that's why I've been coming here for the past 8 years.\n\nWhat makes Roxie's sandwiches so delicious you ask?  In my opinion, they got it all right, on point.  They have the perfect balance of bread, meat, cheese, veggies, and pickles & jalapenos.  The toasted Dutch crunch bread has the perfect ratio of outer crunch to inside moistness and chewiness.  The amount of melted cheese is perfect - not too much to make you feel like you're going to need Gas X for the next few hours, nor not too little to make you think, \"Hello? Are you in there cheese?\"  No single ingredient overpowers the others.  I admit, I'm not much of a pickle or mustard lover, but here at Roxies, I get it all.  It's that good, and these guys seriously have it together.  They surely know what they're doing, and they've been doing it right for decades.\n\nSan Franciscans, if you have not experienced the awesome goodness of Roxies, I'm sorry to say that you are not yet a true SF patron.

They make decent sandwiches, that's for sure, but nothing that I would want to drive all the way back here for.\n\nI ordered the Simon's Special on dutch crunch - a good sandwich with thinly sliced pastrami, turkey, and it's warm with gooey cheese. Definitely hits the spot when you're craving a well crafted sandwich that isn't from a oversized supermarket chain deli. While the sandwich is definitely the best place about here, it wasn't good enough for me to put up with the slow sandwich making and the very long drive. And you can't exactly eat your sandwich there (it's literally a corner store) - I saw people standing in the streets or sitting in their cars eating their sandwiches.\n\nIf I were in the neighborhood or hanging out with friends who wanted to eat here, I wouldn't hesitate to go, but on my own, I'd think twice.", "author": "Katherine P."}

Yes, it's imitation crab but something about it has that craving factor. You know those foods that you just crave sometimes because it left an impression for whatever reason. It's definitely unhealthy because so much mayo but sooo good how they make it. I knocked a star off because the deign of the store is not like I've ever seen. It's a corner liquor store, when you go in, there's a huge rack in the middle and you go around it from the left side there's snacks and things against the wall. When you get around to the back there's some beer and drinks and on the right side is where the magic happens. Sandwich makers are there waiting to take your order. I noticed their dirty rag they use for the cutting board which kind of turned me off one time. Made me wonder if they pass the health inspection okay.

I've heard of several football teams in the area ordering from Roxie's and everyone I've taken has liked it.

This made the whole experience that more intriguing, making me wonder more how great of a sandwich it could be. I must say that they did not disappoint. I ordered a hot Roxie Special on Dutch Crunch and I was pleased with the results. The flavors of the meats and condiments really worked well together with the bread. The guy who rang me up was very friendly and chatted it up with some of his regular customers.

One wall is where the food and deli counter is. Simple and easy and works great. So I order the Roxie special.

Since the place was kinda tight, we ordered and waited outside for them to get done after paying for them.\n\nWhat we weren't expecting was a free show. Almost like something out of Cops! Freaking hilarious shit! This skinny bony dude walks in and orders a sandwich and is leaving the store after paying for it. Then this other guy on a bike, kinda heavy set and looking kinda out of it starts talking shit to the skinny guy. Skinny dude walks backwards across two cross walks while talking smack back at bike guy, navigating their way through on coming traffic. Eventually, the guy with the bike came back and decided to tell us the reason why without much prodding from us. It turns out the skinny dude broke into bike guy's mom's house. Small world...Apparently too small...\n\nSo after the drama ended with a fizzle, our sandwiches slowly got done and we picked them up in order. After we got the food, we turned our attention the park and sat on the grass. The sandwich was amazing! The meats and the surprising melted goodness of American cheese on the sandwich was incredible!

This place can get crazy busy (especially when school is in session (there are at least 5 schools within a couple blocks radius).  If you call in and an older sounding woman picks up the phone just hang up and try back in a few minutes.  The person who answers the phone is the person making your sandwich, and she is super stingy.\n\nIf you called in, when you get there just saunter on up to the register and tell him \"pastrami on the phone\" (or whatever you ordered).  Unless the other patrons physically have sandwiches in their hands and the cashier is actively helping them, there is no one in line.  You can waste a lot of time in there 'waiting in line' when all you've been doing is standing around with all the suckas who didn't call in their order.\n\nI always get the hot pastrami on soft Spanish roll (I know everyone sings the praises of the dutch crunch, but unlike you folks I like the roof of my mouth uninjured, so I go with the soft Spanish roll, kind of like a Cuban roll; soft on the inside and crunchy crusty on the outside).  Hot pastrami on soft Spanish with with everything, extra pickles, add avocado, with provolone or pepper jack.   \n\nTrue New Yorkers would weep at what we do to Pastrami here, but its is the best California style pastrami sandwich around.  I personally don't really dig NY pastrami because its not cut thin enough, and I don't really need to be eating four inches of stacked pastrami on boring ass rye bread.  \n\nI have tried the Roxie special which I don't believe to showcase Roxie's deli skills, I have had an awesome tuna melt  on the aforementioned roll with extra pickles, jalapenos, and of course, avocado.

The Pastrami was a little bit of a disappointment to a girl used to the fresh pastrami from Katz's Deli in NYC.  It was pretty good, though a little on the dry side.   \n\nThe toasting of the bread was a big plus.  My only complaint is with the lack of a menu that tells you which toppings are included and what cheeses they have on hand.  I felt a little lame asking them, although they were nice about it.  Overall, I think these were very good sandwiches, though not quite the best I've ever have (that would have to be Little Lucca in SSF).", "author": "Angela H."}

Believe me, as a web developer I'm all too aware how a quirk in the algorithm can promote some place to the top of the list on the front page, causing everyone to go check it out, causing its number of reviews to go up, causing more people to go, etc.  Internet popularity is a funny phenomena.\n\nBut I'm not (just) coming here because of that.  I'll have you know that I've taken a keen interest in the Ocean Ave/Excelsior area since I moved to the city and noticed it was conspicuously missing from pretty much all neighborhood-by-neighborhood guides of any sort (including *ahem* Yelp).  And besides, Roxie is only 7 minutes from my house (two rock songs), so I qualify as a local.\n\nI had heard of the crowds, so I phoned in my order *and* picked it up at 11:20, so I got right in and out.  I have to say that a liquor-store-cum-sandwich shop sounds awfully sketch on paper, but in practice it's brilliant!  Somehow the whole experience is more fun when there are rows and rows of dusty (and mostly flask-sized) liqour bottles behind the guy making your sandwich.  Could I get that sandwich toasted, and with a pint of SoCo? Nice.\n\nAs I walked out I noticed that this is right across the street from Balboa Park.  Mental note: I gotta get around to checking that place out.  Will start with Yelp-assisted recon, of course.\n\nAnyway, the sandwich turned out to be fantabulous, especially the Dutch Crunch bread.  (I had the Roxie special, by the way.)  Definitely tied for best SF sandwich so far, along with Estella's, but whereas Estella's sandwiches are fresh, airy, and bright, these are packed with soul, but not in a too-greasy or messy way.

That can easily feed 2 people or 1 if  you are SUPER starving!!!  It's a grocery store too, so you can pick up a few grocery essentials while you're there! Also they have a large selection of beer/spirits.\nA really nice family owns the place and they are so fun and charming, and amazingly, with all the people in and out of there, they not only remember names/faces, they remember your sandwich order!! Impressive!!    Anyway, the only downside to ordering at Roxie's is the long line!  Best advice from an old timer?? CALL AHEAD!!  Usually will be ready in 15 min or so...When you get there, the place will no doubt be super busy/packed, but having phoned in your order will eliminate or at least  reduce your wait time.   There are no tables/chairs, strictly a  \"to go\" type situation!   Enjoy!!", "author": "Karen S."}

Their dutch crunch bread is one of the best ones I've ever tasted and I'm a big sandwich person.  I just wanted to give a nod to their piroshkis.  If you know what they are, they aren't authentic Balkan or Baltic piroshki, but DELICIOUS none the less.  If you don't know what they are, piroshkis are a buns stuffed with meat.  I get mine hot with cheddar cheese, which I feel like is the best way it tastes.  If you're health conscious, then this is not for you.  But if you're looking for a good snack, something a little smaller than their sandwiches, then get a hot piroshki with cheese.  Your taste buds will thank you.", "author": "Katria C."}

I think she went the cold cut route and i thought the meatball on dutch crunch sounded like a good idea. And it was. Juicy meatballs, lotsa cheese, doused in red sauce, man, it was great. And that bread - someone needs to tell me where to find that stuff down here in So Cal, i need that in my life. Overall, the best sandy I've had in SF coming from a liquor store.\n\nThe part that made me barf: \n\nAfter getting our sandys, we parked and ate in the car (mad Asian-style). My eyes were bigger than my stomach that day and i ended up saving what i couldn't scarf down for lunch the next day. Waking up early the next morning to catch my flight back to OC, i was hungry as hell and didn't have the right mind to grab something decent to put in my rumbling tummy. Except my left over sandy. So down the hatch it goes and I'm running on meatballs and bread till lunch time. Lunch rolls around and we end up at Red Robin of all places. For some reason, the chicken parm looked appetizing and i rolled with it. I demolished most of it and headed back to the plantation. Some hours pass and my stomach is a rumbling. I ask to go home citing irreconcilable differences with what i ate and I'm off to try to figure out what the hell is wrong with me. A few minutes after pulling into the garage I find myself hunched over my toilet, spewing chunks of meat and about two gallons of red sauce down the drain. Then it dawned on me - no human can possibly think to contain 3 straight meals of meat and acidic tomato-based sauce without finding themselves in some sort of weird predicament such as my own. Lesson learned. \n\nSee? So good it made me throw up!!!", "author": "Ron E."}

He only charged me for the jr turkey and let me have a free jr veggie.\n\nWell when I got home, the turkey is as good as expected. but man, the jr veggie is ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.\nGranted, i'm a very carnivorous male. I love my meats...beef, turkey, pork, duck, goose, everything! But the jr veggie was just amazingly delicious. It's now a contender in my regular choices of pastrami, roxie special, simon special, and roast beef. \n\nfive stars for sure! i've been a long time patron of this restauraunt, and even though the prices went up a little bit and the sandwiches got slightly smaller, they all still taste delicious, and their friendliness and customer service is stellar. \n\nd^^b", "author": "Alvin L."}

There are competitors that I find every now and then but I have yet to taste a better sandwich.  I have been coming here since I was in diapers and have been buying sandwiches since I was allowed to hold money.  My favorites have changed over the years.  I used to love the roast beef on dutch  crunch.  Then it was the crab meat on dutch crunch with jalepenos and chedder cheese.  Then the BBQ Chicken with Avocado.  While my tastes might be changing, my love for this little hole in the wall corner store has stayed constant, and now as an adult I still travel across the city just so I can buy a sandwich and take it home.", "author": "Sam C."}

So, these gentlemen have been creating AWESOME food for many years and serving it with LOVE...real love.\n\nIt's a small business that deserves every kind word the yelpers have given because they are DARN GOOD at what they do!  I am NEVER disappointed and \"if\" I ever were to be unhappy with my sandwich (even if it was my mistake...like I forgot to say I wanted DUTCH CRUNCH) ...they would fix it immediately without even a second thought.\n\nThese sandwiches are BY FAR THE BEST that I have ever had in the entire USA (that includes Puerto Rico too).  And did you know they cash checks???  They have saved my butt a million times when I was too late to catch the bank.\n\nI love them and their food.  It's ALWAYS packed in Roxie.  So, make sure you have a minute to wait.  It will be the BEST wait of  your food-loving life.  Halleluyer!!!", "author": "Karla F."}

But dont let any of it fool you. Roxie's serves up some sandwiches that pack serious taste. Pastrami with everything, on dutch crunch...HEATED. thank you very much.\n\nMy girlfriend asked for her sandwich cold, to which she was asked, \"are you sure?\"..... moments later... \"so you DONT want it heated?\".....and yet again...\"okay, so one sandwich no heat??\" Who knows what they would have done if we came in for the marshmallows. \n\nThe character of this place was enough to earn that extra star. who would have thought that they now make candy in the form of gold teeth?!?!? it's the modern day cigarette gum i guess.\n\nPS. if youre taking your food to go in the bernal heights area, head to the safeway at 30th and San Jo, the drinks and chips are cheaper there...and you might score some ice cream too.", "author": "joe j."}

The store is cramped and dark and definitely does not give off the impression that such remarkable culinary creations come out of it, but this all adds to the charm.

Well, it wasn't gas we needed, and Tony spent at least a half hour troubleshooting what might be the problem. Again, we are talking about a Roxie staff superstar spending his time helping us revive my truck. Not only Tony, but several super friendly guys kept asking us if they could jump our battery or recommend a local mechanic, etc. One fellow even jumped our battery and gave us a watermelon! So, YES a great sandwich, a touching amount of local friendly helping hand flavor, and even though I needed towing, I found my morale higher than it might have been due to how very decent the folks were at and around the Roxie Food Center. besos to Tony and the gang who kicked in trying to lend a hand! and lordy, what a  coupla scrumptious sammies!", "author": "mimsy b."}

This is literally the best sandwich I have ever had in my life.  I've been going here since 1997, when my boss at UPS brought me here.  I arrived and was immediately intimidated by the location, the size of the place, and the fact that is was PACKED with people.  ADA certified?  No...  A place I would do my everyday shopping?  No...  The best price for a soda or six pack of beer?  No... And I don't care.  It's the best sandwich on Earth.  They take your bread and cook it in one oven, not a microwave.  They take your meat and cheese and cook it in a seperate oven.  Then all the fixin's you could want and BANG!  You're rocking with the best sandwich you've ever tasted.  Did I mention that?  Anyway, my favorites are the chicken breast and the crab on dutch crunch with provolone.  The Pastrami with chedder is to die for as well.  My wife LOVES the veggie...  I've only had one sandwich here I didn't like, and that was the one I didn't get.  :)  Simon, Tony, and now all the youngsters will do you up...  Good luck trying to park, because the streets are packed with people that got their sandwiches and couldn't wait to put the keys in the ignition before eating them.  Wanna sandwich before a Giants/49ers game?  Better go early and call it in, because the line will be out the door.  Thanks Roxies for being the best place to eat a meal since I lived at home.", "author": "Chris C."}

I called in the sandos ahead of time, and they were to be ready in 10 minutes- perfect- we were already in the car on the way there. They were just being finished up as I let them know I was there to pick them up- and then the man gave me the sandos and I left. In the car, they smelled so good, I wanted to check 'em out- So I opened one up to take a peek- and realized they WERE NOT MY SANDWICHES!! OMG- So I called them to let them know and they said they were sorry, and to come back and excahnge for the right sandos. I was already home! -SO, went back, he let me keep the wrong ones, which was a bonus, b/c I got to try a few different things I normally wouldnt order, but I still was not impressed. Just okay for me. The dutch crunch was bomb- but just a regular sandwich, where as IKES or LITTLE LUCCAS has special sauce that makes it even MORE BOMB. So, if you live close, go for it- but if you are coming from across the city just to come and try, kinda not worth it. :(", "author": "Tara M."}

I told him to mix it up and he took care of it.  I gave them a couple of hours notice so they were well prepared in time (sorry people waiting in line that day, I ordered a lot).  I had my bud drive down there because they couldn't deliver and even he said it was well worth it.  One thing that kind of surprised me was the tray deposit.  If I had wanted to get a tray I needed to put down a $20 deposit.  Needless to say, I didn't want it.  I also didn't want to have the hassle of driving it back.  At work, my crew just tore into it.  I might have ordered a little too much, but in the end I took some home with me and I am still enjoying them.

I have been eating sandwiches from here for over 10 years, and have tried almost every sandwich they have-Turkey, Pastrami, Roast Beef, Simon's Special, the list goes on....and every single sandwich I have ever had from them has been worthy of some random award on the food network...best sandwich, best service, best everything. Now, I can tell you all about how delicious their food is, how much meat they put in the sandwiches, how they perfectly toast their dutch crunch, how they have the balance of mayo to mustard down to a science, but I'm going to tell you about their service instead. Because honestly, as good as their food is, it would be nothing without the amazing people behind the counter. Every single time I go there, I am greeted with a smile from all the employees. Not only do they take my order, they ask what I'm up to, where I'm coming from, where I'm going. They tell me about their day, how their vacation was, the last crazy who came into the store wanting to sell his kidney. It's something you see on TV-the main character who goes into a coffee shop and everyone knows who she is, and what she wants, and where she sits. It's a pretty damn good feeling. And then you end your experience with the guy at the register lowering the price just for you, or throwing in a piece of candy. Because let's be honest, who doesn't love a free piece of candy, and they know it'll make you happy while you're enjoying your regular toasted simon's special with no jalapenos and salt/pepper.

I prefer the regular meatball....but still everything on their menu is delicious. The Roxie's special is also a personal favorite, combining everything heavenly in one sandwich. What seems like a \"family\" store has great service and you can't help smile when the cashier asks you \"whatcha get boss?\" when you pay. 5 stars!", "author": "Nathan M."}
