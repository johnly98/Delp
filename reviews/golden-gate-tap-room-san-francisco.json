It was crowded but not too much that you are touching elbows with other people . It was a fun place to be and it's spacious that makes a great place for a hang out that's not too stuffy. There's a bar on the left side or you can sit in the tables and have a waiter serve you. There are also arcade games , pool tables, and a bunch of other games for everyone to have fun and play with .

This place is definitely a sports bar as the identity leaves no ambiguity whatsoever.  Big screens showing games, video games, music, wings, beer and such give the place a life of a clubhouse type of hangout.\n\nWhile I didn't feel like having any food I very well could have gone with something since they have options for small and larger sharing type plates.  You can get a small plate of wings or you can get a wing platter with different flavors.  Typical bar type food like burgers, sandwiches, etc are all on the menu here as well as an extensive drink menu with a full bar as well.\n\nI wasn't hungry for bar food at the time so I did stay and sit at the bar for just a couple beers because after a long day of going all over the city a nice sit down drink or two was all I was looking for here.\n\nI didn't see too many places like this around the area so this being one of the few or only one I noticed was filling a niche in the neighborhood I'm guessing.  Being that there are so many hotels in the area there's a lot of out of towners like myself just looking for this type of place in the area so it works out.", "author": "Lambert P."}

No, I don't need to hear my 8th different boss talk about the new coversheets for our TPS reports (love Office Space!).  I get it - I had my fair share of those at my old company.  Though, we did have some awesome ones as well, like that one offsite, inter-department, cross-functional operations and team strategy meeting...\n\n...where we snuck off to Golden Gate Tap Room to watch some Champions League soccer, eat, grab some drinks, and play some games.  Team building, amirite?  #sorrynotsorry\n\nAlthough I had heard about this place quite a few times over the years, I never really knew much beyond how it's an uber popular spot to catch just about any sporting event.  And now that I can say I've been here, it's easy to see why!  They have TONS of beers and alcohol to choose from, it's fairly spacious (there are multiple floors), and there are TVs and projectors in every direction!  Plus...there's plenty of food!\n\nRegardless of your dietary preferences, you can find just about anything to eat from their list of bar bites - chicken wings, ribs, carne asada fries, tacos, nachos, quesadillas, potato skins, pot stickers, spinach dip, truffle mac n cheese, skewers, jalapeno poppers, calamari, mozzarella sticks...do I need to keep going?  Sadly though, despite how tasty a lot of their stuff sounded, I ended up settling for their FRIED CHICKEN SANDWICH ($14) since none of my coworkers were in the mood for appetizers (boooo...).\n\nAs a whole, this wasn't too shabby!  The chicken is coated with either BBQ or buffalo sauce (I chose the latter) and topped with coleslaw, bacon, and Swiss cheese on a French roll alongside your choice of fries (I went with truffle fries).  While I didn't care much for the French roll (a little dry and bready), everything else was solid!  The chicken was juicy with a slight kick, the bacon was crispy, the cheese was just slightly melted, and the fries were terrific (loved the dip!).  Yum!\n\nBesides how the food was pretty decent, as well as the huge beer list, Golden Gate Tap Room just simply has a fun vibe to it.  If the food, TVs, and alcohol aren't enough to keep you entertained, there's a whole variety of games to play, including shuffleboard, foosball, skeeball, pool tables, pinball machines, and arcade games.  Throw in some random ticket games and it'd be like being at D&B, but without those obnoxious prices and crowds!\n\nWhile it was a breeze for us to snag a table (middle of the workday and all), I hear it can get super packed here during major sporting events, like World Cup matches or playoff games.  In those cases, coming early would be strongly recommended, especially if you want a table.  Otherwise, in between, this is definitely a great spot to spend a night with friends or to play hooky with coworkers!\n\nI mean, to attend offsite, inter-department, cross-functional operations and team strategy meetings.

Don't worry they have a WALL of taps and dozens more bottles to choose from.\n\nMy ONLY complaint is the lack of couple tables. Leaving several of the group tables half full with two people cutting back on seating for new or late arrivals.

The game was at 5P and we came over around 4:20P, and the bouncers said standing room only, plus a $10 cover charge. We paid the cover and walked in, and I expected it to be like club-level crowded. Instead it was more of a casual bar scene leading up to the game, with groups of people hanging out at the bar or around tables. \n\nIt definitely got a lot more crowded as the game went on but we managed to snag a few chairs that were unoccupied at various tables, and eventually we collected enough chairs for our whole group to set up shop in front of the big screen. \n\nWe ordered French fries (5.00), jalape\u00f1o poppers (5.00), and a Magner's (5.00). The first time around, everything came to our table fairly quickly (about 25 minutes, but quick considering how packed it was). The second time around we wanted to order more appetizers, and one of my friends went up to the bar to place his order. Two hours later our appetizers still didn't make it to the table, and the waitress wasn't too friendly when we asked her to check on our order. I understand that it was extremely busy, but we were frustrated that the waitress kept checking on the other groups around us, either refilling their orders or bringing the bills to their table, all the while telling us there's nothing they could do if our order isn't ready. \n\nThis was a fun place to watch the game and the crowd was passionate and energetic, all of which made for a fun viewing experience. Based on the poor service, however, I'm unlikely to come here again.", "author": "Mili P."}

Finally last Tuesday, May 2nd, I ended up here with Peter L around 8:45pm. They were carding at the door, so I guess you have to be 21+ in order to get inside. We did a couple of laps on both floors and ended up finding a table on the second floor after a couple left.\n\n*Blue Moon Nachos ($5), add Chicken (+$3): house made tortillas topped with special cheese, bacon, scallions and chopped tomato\n*Popcorn Shrimp ($9): panko crusted and fried served with cajun mayo\n*Flame Grilled Burger ($12): tomato, lettuce, onion, and mayo with cheddar cheese\n*Allagash White: allagash brewing company (portland me) witbier 5% abv ($7)\n*Red Trolley: karl strauss brewing co (san diego ca) red ale 5.8% abv ($7)\n\nI actually tried ordering two other beers before I settled on the allagash white. I guess they were all out of the other two which was a little disappointing. At least Peter got his first choice. The food itself was okay. I guess just normal bar food. Nothing special about any particular dish. But if I was throwing back a bunch of beers, I'd be glad they were offering food like nachos, popcorn shrimp, and a burger. It's good having food to sop up all the alcohol.\n\nThe main reason to come here is all the TVs! I think every seat has a good view of at least one TV. Luckily, we were in front of the huge screen with three TVs screens on display, so I had a great view of two screens. Could look left or right and see the game. I'm not sure if they play different games simultaneously, but that night, they were just playing the Warriors game.\n\nGlad I finally stopped by to catch a game. I actually wanted to show up earlier to check out happy hour, but Peter wanted to visit a different bar. (Which ended up being closed by the way, so I should stop listening to him!) I'll probably be back to catch another game. And hopefully, HH as well!", "author": "Elena N."}

We decided to check this place out since it was only a short walk away from our hotel. Initially walking in the concept is pretty cool. They have some older arcade games like skee ball and the game where you slap the alligators on the head as they pop out of their holes, definitely nostalgic.\n\nFood wise however this place was lacking. First off if you come before noon plan on eating breakfast only since the menu doesn't switch over til 12 on the dot. Once lunch time hit we ordered the nachos, wings and garlic fries. The nachos were super cheap, only $5 during game days, but the flavor was very disappointing. They tasted super bland and the toppings weren't very evenly distributed. The wings were probably the best part. We tried the BBQ which had a good flavor to it and they were cooked just right. The fries were pretty alright too, but just your standard ol garlic fries. There really wasn't anything unique or outstanding about any of our options.\n\nOverall I guess I was expecting more of this place, but just ended up disappointed.

First time was a few years ago when GGTR was courting my alumni group for football season. We hosted an event and not once during said event did anyone come up to me, ask if I wanted anything to drink, etc. I didn't feel welcome or appreciated that I had brought them a decent amount of business.\n\nSecond time around, we were told that unless we agreed to a dollar minimum to be placed on a credit card in advance, we should arrive 2 hours early to reserve tables. It was communicated to us that both floors would be open. This was not the case: they understaffed for the night in preparation for college football the next morning, which I get. I was upset because we were told holding an area wouldn't be an issue. \n\nLucky for GGTR and not for me, I only had half my expected guest list show up, and we managed to get a table. Our server was very helpful and even brought out a folding table for a silent auction we were doing.

Two of my work colleagues suggested we make a party of it and head to the city to watch the game.  We had two gastropubs closer to our work but it's not the same!  Yelp led us to Golden Gate Tap Room, a short walk from Powell St. BART.\n\nApparently, many other GSW fans had the same idea, and there was a 10-15 min line that wrapped around the block.  Also a $10 cover charge to get in.  Outside the entrance is a statue of Warriors (and Cavs) legend #42, Nate Thurmond.  \n\nThe bar itself has three large floors of TVs and games like foosball and video games.  We literally found no tables or places to sit - since some folks arrived as early as 3PM for 6PM tipoff.  Eventually my friend convinced a bunch of young ladies if we could share their table to eat. They agreed and in return, my buddy covered their tab, food and all!  We also got seats for the rest of the game!\n\nThey had about 100 beers on tap it seems.  My max is 2-3 so I got lighter drinks with 4-5% ABV: Angry Orchard Cider (5 stars), Ginger Lemon Radler (4 stars), and Crispen Original Cider (3 stars).\n\nFood is actually pretty good and affordable.  My faves were the Blue Moon Chicken Nachos (cheesy, strong bacon flavor with chicken) and Cheese Quesadillas.  Jalape\u00f1o Poppers were good, but Vegetarian Pot Stickers not (my coworker said they are too light, and he's a vegetarian).\n\nOverall a great place to watch the game, especially if you get a seat.

Located at the heart of Union Square, I'm sure they get all the tourists mixed in with all the locals, which is why this space is HUGE!

They have a great selection of  beer on tap as well as a good selection of cider, either in pints or pitchers. Dark to light beer, you name it! Scattered around the floor are a ton of arcade games and foosball tables, as well as corner tables and long couches people can gather on. There are also a bunch of TV's projecting everywhere the latest game that's on, which makes this a great sports bar especially on major game days.\n\nThe bar food here is really good! I've had some of their fish tacos, sliders and sweet potato fries. They are decently priced too especially if you're sharing it! The last time I was here was during Santacon where there was a million of people crowded in the bar and my group of people were really surprised at how quick the food service was once we brought the number to the table.\n\nIt can get pretty loud and crazy here on game days (and major drinking days such as Santacon), but it's worth the fun after a few drinks and great company!", "author": "Kathleen S."}

My friend P and I decided to oblige him for a while, but most nearby hot spots were closed at 10:30 pm on Wednesday night. (Hmmm. must not be Manhattan).\n\nBut the GGTR was still going strong. After showing our IDs to the ex-linebacker up front, we walked upstairs, sldled up to the bar and stood agog at the selection - on the order of 100 draft beers here. Craziness! (but my kinda crazy) We each ordered something to suit our fancy (I chose Raging Bitch Belgian IPA from Flying Dog - not something I often see on the West coast).\n\nWe weren't eating food at that hour, but I scanned the menu - They seemed to have a decent selection of bar food, plus burgers, salads and short list of standard entrees. \n\nNear the end of our first round, two young ladies in tight, revealing clothing walked up, smiled seductively, and asked if we were interested in some \"company\". (I can be \"slow on the uptake\" sometimes, but it was pretty clear to me they weren't escapees from a bachelorette party).  We smiled and politely declined; and they expressed their disappointment, while giving us long, friendly stares. Not the first time this has ever happened, but certainly the first time in a bar or restaurant. Wacky.\n\nAfter ordering our second (and last) round of beers we noticed these same two ladies had openly approached almost every group of guys in the bar, supposedly with the same opening line. And neither the bartenders or staff seemed to take notice. And how'd they get past that burly bouncer downstairs? (Regulars?)\n\nBut I digress. As sports bars go, this is one of the better ones I have been to. There's plenty of space, TVs everywhere, and a whole section of games like foosball, skeeball, pool and arcade games.  Not to mention the killer beer list.  I would be happy to come here and see a game sometime, provided the crowds were not too heavy.", "author": "Dan B."}

When we first sat down, tables were half full but there was no waitress in sight so we went to the bar to order drinks. When the waitress, Karla, eventually made her rounds she seemed annoyed and disturbed that we chose to grab our own drinks rather than wait for her. It took over an hour for us to place a food order with her...and over 45 min to get nachos. Tables who ordered after us were served before us and actually finished their meals prior to us getting ours or even a simple acknowledgement from the waitress. We had to inquire several times if there was any update on our order.\n\nOnce we were ready to go, it took her over 30 minutes to close our tab and forgot which card was ours, most likely the reason for the wait. \n\nNot sure if they were understaffed or if she was having a bad day but our table was no doubt ignored by the waitress.

Free stuff, especially free food, is awesome, but that's not the only thing that impressed us.\n\nTheir TV screens are humongous! It's almost as if you are at the real live game. I'm not a huge sports fan like most Bay Area people are, but I actually really enjoyed watching the Warriors play on those huge screens.\n\nOf course a sports bar has to have pool tables! They are placed right in front of the tv screens (but it's okay since the screens are so huge). We played a few rounds. 1 game costs $2. If you pay $5, you get to play 3 games. These pool and tv screen areas (2 total) can be reserved ahead of time for your group of friends. I would love to celebrate a birthday here!\n\nOther amenities include shuffleboard (this seems to always be taken!), skeeball ($1 per game), a few arcade games, and fooseball.\n\nThe bar is really cool too.

You also have a chance to win a shot of whiskey too.\n\nLike I said before this place is huge. They reserve what I want to call semi private viewing areas for guest to enjoy more intimate seating to watch the game or just chat with friends and co workers. With large projector style screens and booth seating these are some of the best seats in the house.\n\nAs for the food. We ordered from the GAME DAY menu, boneless wings with the sauce of the side 8 bucks and nachos with chicken and bacon $6 bucks. Wings were great, not overly breaded and freshly fried so they were piping hot. Nachos were okay I found the nacho cheese to be cold, kinda disappointing but the beers were also a deal $18 for 4 IPAS.

I didn't expect much since it's so close to Union Square and the entrance from the street is just a doorway. However, this place is HUGE and has a lot to offer. We met on the top floor where there was an entire wall covered in screens to watch the various games that were on at that time. The food was decent (ordered the sliders) and the service was good. We didn't get to scope out the floor below except for a quick glance as we walked downstairs to exit, but it looked pretty cool too. We were there on a Friday night and it got pretty busy by 6-6:30. If you want a table, get there early. Also, in the back of the top floor was an area that could be reserved (I heard it had a pretty steep minimum though, so it's only good for large groups or those that drink a lot).\n\nTip: don't come here for a meet and greet (which we did) because it was way too loud to have a really good conversation without yelling and getting a headache. Awesome place to just hang out with friends and watch a game though.", "author": "Susan G."}

You do not want to watch the game here because you will not be *able* to watch the game here!\n\nMy girlfriend and I showed up here on Sunday, promptly in time for kickoff of the Raiders vs Chargers game. We got seats in front of the big screen and we ordered our drinks and about $50 worth of food.\n\nBy halftime, a group of about 30 people were standing in front of us and blocking the TV from every angle imaginable. We talked to the staff, who were polite and friendly, but they couldn't do anything because the birthday party was booked by the owner.\n\nIt turns out that the owner of this \"sports bar\" actually booked a birthday party in the middle of the biggest TV in the bar during the one of the biggest local rivalry games! We watched about 15 Raiders and Chargers fan leave the bar to watch the game elsewhere and, soon, we did too.\n\nAt no point did anybody warn us that there was going to be a party in front of the TV. Instead, we were duped into spending good money at the bar and then having the game yanked away from us before halftime.\n\nWhen we talked to the staff about the disturbance, their hands were tired because it was the owner's group of friends. Additionally, when we talked to the people at the party about trying to stay out of the way of the TV, many were friendly, but the owner *who was there with them* would not talk to us or even make eye contact with us.\n\nThis owner has poor priorities and does not know how to run a good sports bar. As an example, do you know what else is in front of the big screen? The pool table.\n\nAlso, from what I can see on their website in retrospect, it looks as if they really want to be an events space instead of a sports bar, so maybe that will be better for them.\n\nIn short, don't come here if you're interested in watching the game: The space has probably been rented out and you won't be able to watch it here.", "author": "Charles H."}

Usually when I've gone the service has just been run of the mill bad, but my visit yesterday was truly awful. Among other things: \n\n-When a patron asked the bartender to recommend a good bourbon + something to pair it with, he made fun of the guy. Said \"We have a lot of bourbons and a lot of 'somethings', so just pick one.\" \n\n-I showed up 30 mins before the World Series and asked a different bartender if he could put the game on a certain TV for me. He told me that they couldn't switch channels to a game until it was on (no one was viewing the TV I requested). I asked if he could at least promise to put the game on when it started, to which he told me to return to the bar at the start time and ask again. This is absurd; I've never seen a sports bar do this, ever. 5 minutes before game start we had to flag someone else down, who reluctantly put on the game for us.\n\n-I asked if the third floor was going to be open, and the bartender shrugged his shoulders at me and said he didn't know/urged me to get on with my drink order. (The whole concept of a sports bar is: I'm paying a markup for drinks in exchange for you putting my game on. So the 'game' part is kinda important.)\n\n-Servers demanded credit cards upfront as soon as we sat down, which may not be typical but is fine. Except that they also refused to switch the cards over that we had already put down at the bar. So we had to run to the bar, try to close out, and give the servers those cards in the middle of the game.\n\nWhile SF doesn't have many good sports bars, I'm not wasting another dollar at GGTR. Service is prohibitively bad and ruins the experience.", "author": "Brian R."}

The first thing I noticed as we walked up the stairs to the bar is that this was an absolute sports bar.  As soon as we got inside I noticed tons of Tvs and projectors showing the football games, it was a playoff weekend, so it was pretty darn crowded.  Besides not being able to grab a table this place was awesome!!  They have an amazing beer selection and it's nice that they have it separated by the type of beer which makes choosing a beer a lot easier. \n\nI was actually able to come here the next day, but we were warned that if we wanted a good seat we had to show up before the placed opened up...boy am I glad that I took the advice.  We showed up 15 minutes prior to opening and there was already two groups ahead of us.  By the time they opened the line was down the block.  So once we had a great seat, it was time to order food!  We tried the nachos, fries and wings (typical bar food).  While it wasn't the best it was good enough.  \n\nWhat really made this place was the ambiance that all of the Tvs, sports memorabilia, arcade games, and even some shuffle boards created.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-15", "description": "I was so excited to try this place, but was so disappointed, for multiple reasons! First, a \"tap room\" typically implies a place with expertise in craft beer. A couple of the rotating taps were out, whereas others were beers easily secured in the local supermarket. I even asked about one, in particular, and was told it was a \"sour\", but it was a saison that I know is not sour. Again, maybe small differences to some, but for those big into beer and expecting that type of treatment at a \"tap room\", it was disappointing. Not to mention, our beer took 30 minutes to come out of the bar....\n\nThen, the food. It also took forever, and then, two orders came out - neither of which were correctly made (these were not complicated changes!). The person who brought it then implied that we must have placed two orders, and that it was on us to notify our server of the change to our bill needing to be made. \n\nLastly, the person who brought our food offered to bring the ingredient missing from my plate, assuring me it would not cost extra. Twenty minutes later, it came, after I ate the burger... and we were charged extra for it. At this point, I just wanted out of here desperately. \n\nI don't even know. This review is a mess, because this place was truly a mess. I would recommend figuring out an identity (if it were marketed as a \"sports bar\", not a \"tap room\", I would have had a different reaction to the beer situation), and cleaning up the food service substantially.

Really fun place to watch any game on tv. Stayed here for a few hours watching some football game and had a great time. This was my second time here and It was even better this time around. \n\nEnded up ordering 3 different beers at the bar and sitting closer to the pool tables watching the game on the big screen. We were there so long we ended up ordering food which was exactly what I needed. We decided to split a few things so naturally we got the mac and cheese, chicken fingers, and a bahn mi chicken wrap - all were really really good. The mac was super creamy and amazing. \n\nMy only complaint is that the servers that walk around were not the most friendly. We asked them if they took drink orders and they said no we had to go order at the bar which i thought was a little strange but it was busy so I get it, still kind of a weird experience as a customer. \n\nAlso when we went up to grab another beer at the bar, the server took our food away! i was not even close to being done - the mac and cheese was only half way gone. i'm sorry but does anyone leave half of their mac and cheese ever? the answer is no.

Much better to muni/bart in rather than attempt to find parking. \n\nWe went to watch the Warriors play the Rockets. \n\nWe had a big group and we also managed to snag a table which was pretty lucky as we got there around 5. Good WARNING: If you come here for a public event of some sort ie basketball games/sports watching you should come early or suffer having to stand around. Watching people try to chat and hold pitchers of beer at the same time looked quite sad. \n\nSo we were there about a hour and a half early, but good company made it fun. \n\nOur waitress was really nice and let us know since it was going to be a busy night that it may take awhile but that we wouldn't be forgotten. Upfront honesty like that is always appreciated. \n\nOur group got garlic fries and nachos, everyone seemed to enjoy them. Between everyone people got hard ciders, ipa, and different pitchers of beer. I'm not an IPA fan...but the guys enjoyed it.\n\nHonestly the atmosphere was really good for lack of words. It wasn't sketchy or divey and even with us all watching the game and it being EXTREMELY packed I never felt unsafe being there.

Typically I like this place, never had much of an issue but will never be back. This review is for the tool of a \"security guard\" who feels the need to publicly shame a group of people who have absolutely no idea what you are saying. \n\nA few of the people with us had forgotten their passports at home and we're not aware they wouldn't be allowed to drink since they were let in. A few minutes after beer was brought to our table, security walks up to one of our visitors and starts chastising him about not having a stamp and how he was already informed at the door he would not be able to drink. The entire time this poor guy has no idea what is being said to him as security tries to kick him out. \n\nI called the guy over and explained they are from Japan and speak hardly any English (something you think they would be used to in such a touristy area). I was condescendingly told how he would have to check with his associates since it was \"so busy\" on a Wednesday night and he had no problem kicking us all out and clearing our table up. \n\nAs the guy was gone we try and explain to our group exactly what is going on, meanwhile our friend from Japan is sweating bullets thinking he may be getting arrested. Once security comes back he feels the need to make everyone from Japan without a stamp raise their hands up in the air, again they have no idea what he is saying, and makes the one guy in particular raise his hands all the way up as high as he can so people can see they don't have a stamp. They are foreign not stupid and certainly not children. \n\nI understand the law and the rules, however, instead of making yourself look like a complete ass, try and understand exactly what is happening. Our company pays for us to do these types of events as team building but in the future our money can be better spent elsewhere. We ended up leaving early and closing are tab sooner rather than later. \n\nRant over.", "author": "Nate S."}

My friends and I randomly stumbled upon this bar on a Friday night and were pleasantly surprised. The vibe was great and there was plenty of entertainment all throughout the establishment. \n\nThis is pretty much like those family fun centers you used to go to as a kid...but for adults! I saw plenty of beer (the beer menu almost fills up the entire wall), food, and tons of flatscreens showing which game is on at the moment. There's also a variety of entertainment such as arcades (deer hunter hd, pacman, tekken), shuffleboard, pool tables, and skeeball. I did see plenty of seats and tables as well as an area that can be reserved for private parties. Eveyone seemed very lively and the place is well-lit unlike some dim sports bars I've been to.\n\nMy only complaint is that the floor was pretty sticky when I went and that the place closes fairly early for a weekend. I would've wanted to stay past the midnight closing time but sadly that was not the case. Hopefully, I can make a visit earlier and the floor will be cleaner.\n\nThis is a great sports bar in the city! It's only a few blocks away from a parking garage (Sutter-Stockton) and there's no cover charge. I will visit again with a bigger group of friends to watch a game sometime!", "author": "Chris M."}

We managed to find a seat in front of one of the huge TV screens. Our server was very attentive and efficient. After the game we wandered around the place playing various games such as Skee ball, pool and pinball. Our server managed to find us and kept our drinks flowing. I wish I had gotten her name since she did such a great job. \n\nLater in the evening we decided to have a bite to eat but unfortunately the second floor was closed. We were able to get a couple of seats at the bar and we did order some food. We got a couple of beers to go with our food and waited. After 45 minutes of waiting and no food (the bar tender never checked on us in this time) we were able to flag down one of the bar tenders to find out what happened to our food. A few minutes later we were told that the kitchen lost our order but we would get our food soon. It ended up taking nearly an hour to get our order of jalapeno poppers and a quesadilla, something that should have taken no more than 15 minutes. \n\nThe entire time we were waiting for our food we were sitting at the bar. Not once did the bar tender ask if we needed anything or even notice that we had not received our food. It's not like he couldn't see us since he spent a fair amount of time serving the young ladies several shots that were sitting right next to me. \n\nOver all we did have a fun time.

Looking at all the games around the room and smelling the fresh popcorn, I thought to myself, how could this place only have 3 stars on Yelp? \n\nAnd then the evening commenced. I felt like a child when the bartender furrowed her brow as my friend and I ordered two Hoptologists, and she warningly said to me, \"Okay, you know that's 9% and it's a 20 oz bottle?\". She may as well have patted me on the head and told me to go play with the other kids while she served my male friend with a smile. \n\nI guess I give off the vibe of being a dumba$s blonde chick who doesn't know what beer to order, so she twirls her hair and bats her eyelashes and just gets \"what he's having\" (which I have never said), or the one that \"sounds the coolest\", or \"has the prettiest picture\", but I just want to say to all the patronizing bartenders out there that I've been encountering as of late: I enjoy beer. I like hoppy, strong IPAs, and in large amounts. This is not, in fact, my first rodeo, and I would prefer to be treated like an adult when I present my ID and my cash and ask nicely for the beer I want to drink.\n\nSo, 20 oz, 9% beers in hand, we strolled around the giant space to a table by the window and watched the hockey game on one of the many big screen TVs. The atmosphere is fun, with a  kind of nice college town / young professionals / older professionals kind of feel to it. People were playing skiball, pool, and shuffleboard, I saw a bunch of people eating massive burgers and I realized how hungry I was.\n\nWe ordered the Pulled Pork Tacos, which were dry and flavorless and covered with sour cream and red onions. We were both literally dumping Tobasco sauce on them just to give them *some* kind of flavor. We also got the California Nachos, which were thin strips of fried tortilla covered in nacho cheese sauce, green onions, a few measly crumbles of bacon, and some kind of (no doubt) canned, chilli-looking substance. Needless to say we were underwhelmed, and the portions are pretty small, but at around $4.50 to $5.50, it's not too terribly expensive. \n\nWe ordered a Tricerahops each and then scampered out into the windy SF evening and onto our next locale. I doubt I'll be back anytime soon, but I will say that it is a clean, huge place, good for groups, not too expensive for where it's at, and a seriously awesome playlist (that may have been a fluke, but still).

Seriously if anyone has been to a dave and busters, a buffalo wild wings, or even a wingstop would be very let down in this place. \n\nThey have the outer shell of one of these places but its just not as fun. There are a few games like deer hunter, some fighting games and pacman going on but the place is really crowded and no one seems to want to actually have fun here. The prices are also what you would expect in union square san francisco. Incredibly expensive. \n\nI have to say they have found their niche though. In a city that doesn't have anything like this except maybe urban putt you are going to have a lot of city folks and tourist flocking here and they have that. It is crowded all the time but is like a tech revival of a sports bar. It just feels inauthentic. I don't want to play shuffleboard next to people in suits. It just feels weird. \n\nThe food was decent and fried which is all you need in a place like this. Really though you come here to watch sports. It is a great place to go if you are looking to watch the warriors or 49ers with other fans. It gets incredibly packed then and there is usually a line out the door so be prepared. \n\nThere is nothing special about Golden Gate but it will get business and positive reviews from people who don't know there is a whole world of places that do what they do better.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-06-17", "description": "Would rather give it a 2.5 if that were an option.  Will be first to say, overall, I like watching games here as it is the best space & really the only true sports bar in the city.  It also has a pretty legit beer selection.  \n\nHowever, the big complaint here is that it is not even close to being prepared to handle large crowds like there were for the Warriors games last night.  There are only 4 bartenders, but space is big enough to have probably 1,000 patrons.  Not a good combo.  The other problem is they don't have anyone bussing tables.  Since most people were with groups, most people tried ordering pitchers, but with a hundred plus person wait at the bar, no one could get served since they ran out of pitchers due to not having any bus boys.  It took 40 minutes to get served and that was only because I had my friends bring back our empties and have them just refill our old pitchers.  \n\nAnother big issue is their servers are worthless.  I've been here even on nights when there isn't a crowd and have had to go to the bar or go walk and find the servers standing at the front on their phones.  They make ZERO effort, so another reason for a bad line at the bar as well.  \n\nLast night, they closed down the kitchen 5 minutes into the game.  Most people came here directly from work and not able to eat anything.  This is a big problem for a sports bar to not even come close to having their kitchen prepared when you know it is going to be a big night.  \n\nAnd last but not least, it is absolutely ridiculous to charge a $10/person cover.  Yes, it was a fun experience because you're able to watch with a lot of fans and have plenty of TVs.  But this is the only sports bar I have ever had to pay a cover for and this is for a place where we couldn't even get more than 1 round of beer and zero food.  \n\nIt's a shame to see, as this is a really cool space and has a lot of potential.

Having a Monday night game with my favorite team while I was away on business, I needed a place to stop in and catch the game, and Golden Gate Tap Room fit the bill. While the food was good, service was very, very slow and took a while to get everything together.\n\nAtmosphere - San Franscicans will appreciate the local sports theme, and this downtown bar has it. From the 49ers and Golden State Warriors decor, along with brick walls and worn wooden floors, this place is definitely great for football! I counted at least four projection screens and a host of TV's, although some areas were reserved for private parties. A generously stocked back bar and a host of stools around the bar provided a good walk in experience here.\n\nWaitstaff - I'm not sure why they didn't think they would be busy, but I counted three waitresses in a bar with about 125 people. I guess they weren't expecting many out of towners, but they were strongly overmatched on service. I had various people including a manager ask me if I wanted things to eat, but my order came out staggered, didn't get my beer until I was 1/2 way through my meal. Waitress did come over at the end... to give me the bill.\n\nFood - Game day food menu is pretty good. Started with boneless wings which were meaty and had a nice tangy sauce. Meal was the San Fran Sliders and fries. Fries were meh, but sliders were a bit greasy, but good. Since both items were on the 'Game Day' menu, only wound up spending about $20 on food, but a few dollars more on the fine beer selection. \n\nIntangibles - Great walking distance from many of the downtown hotels in this district, and they keep security manned outside to keep certain elements (i.e. homeless) outside of the bar. Had many sections reserved for guests, may have been for the later home game because place was 1/2 full and many were standing. Runners told me I had to buy drinks at the bar, but manager asked what I wanted and brought it out, some confusion between staff here.\n\nOverall - If you are in a cheap hotel with no cable, or want to get out and catch a game, Golden Gate Tap Room is a fairly decent spot. Decent food and beverages, and a good theme, this place would have ranked higher with more help. Chalk it up to a rookie mistake and if you're in town and need your sports fix, this would be a good spot to catch up in.", "author": "Christian B."}

If you can't decide on a drink - you spin the wheel and whatever bottle the wheel lands on is your beer. I think this concept is so much fun and a great way to help those like myself who can be indecisive at times!\n\nI'm not a huge fan of E.D.M., rap, country, and the typical music you hear at the average bar. I was elated when this bar played Rage Against The Machine, Tool, Metallica, AC/DC, Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and similar music. Not only did they play awesome music like that, but they kept the music at a reasonable volume so I didn't have to yell and scream at my companions. \n\nOn top of the beer and the music, this bar had arcade games and shuffle board for the patrons. I was able to rent really nice shuffle board pieces for 10 cents / minute and played shuffle board on one of their really nice table tops.  \n\nI will DEFINITELY make a return visit to this bar if I fly back to San Francisco. Dare I say - this may be one of my all-time favorite bars tying with the Radio in Tel Aviv and the Signature Lounge in Chicago.", "author": "Justin V."}

I feel like the presentation and concept of this place warrants a 5-star review but there were several shortcomings.\n\n*\u00a0The place was around 60% full, but it felt like 100% or above-capacity. All the tables were occupied but the aisles were fairly clear. It was around a 10+ minute wait to order at the bar on Floor 2. The ordering-points are not delineated very clearly, so people are just congregating around them in a lump not really knowing who was next. We were told there wasn't anymore glass pitchers available for beer, so we had to wait in line later to get a pitcher. Imagine how this would be if the place was 100% full?\n\n*\u00a0The patrons are basically left to fend for themselves for tables. I'm confident in my abilities to be diplomatic and communicate with people around me when I'm trying to wait for a table, but I could see situations where there would be fights and discord regarding this. Waiting for an hour and then have people swoop in and take the seats. Who was first? There's no system to figure that part out. If security were stationed in sections and kept an eye on parties present and parties waiting, it would greatly help move this along.\n\n*\u00a0A security guard told us we couldn't stand in a aisle and that we had to move -- understandable -- but he did not present a solution as to where we *could* be. Later in that same aisle people had placed chairs and remained there for a few hours without interruption. When security gives you the feeling of a nightclub along the lines of -- \"and you can leave too\" -- it's not exactly a welcoming environment for your patrons that are there to give you money and make your business successful.\n\nIt doesn't seem like the facility can support the amount of floor space it currently has. Long rows of fixed-stool seating with access for bussers and more TVs on empty walls could go a long way. This feels like a volume store, and the business model can do well with that no-frills approach. Add a stockroom upstairs or wherever perhaps, and more seating would be great.", "author": "A. W. Z."}

Huge TVs, projectors to watch games on walls, arcade games, bar food, and alcohol...all in one place.\nThe location is so unassuming as well, right in the heart of Union Square, nobody really notices it's there, which is odd because the place is huge (like 3-4 stories huge).\nThe draft beer selection is very wide, and moderately priced (most beers are $6-7 pints).\n\nMy only complaint is the food selection. Lots of bars offer some sort of simple salad (celery with dip, perhaps) to make it feel like you're able to order something healthy.

Football games START at 10 AM Pacific so this means, especially considering the line outside this joint, that fans are forced to miss pregame entertainment and the first few plays of the game.  \n\nSecond, the drinks come in plastic cups.  Maybe you're average sports fan isn't an environmentalist but I personally watched loads of plastic being trashed in just 90 minutes.  Is that better than the water used to wash glass?  Not sure but I hope they are recycling that plastic despite it appearing they do not.\n\nThird, the food was ghastly.  I ordered the breakfast burrito.  I couldn't finish it.  I am now at a nearby place ordering something else.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-21", "description": "The great thing about sports bars is that it brings together all sorts of people who share a common interest, whether it's in a game, socializing, or just drinking on a weekday evening. The Golden Gate pub is one such place that provides a large, expansive venue for bringing people together under the guise of anything related to watching sports.  There are too many TVs to count, of all different sizes, and strategically placed to divvy up a multitude of viewing spaces. The result? A pleasantly controlled space where you're never too close to any group that might be way more or less invested in a game than you are. \n\nBesides the wonderfully organized physical space, the table service could benefit from similar attention to detail; placing orders for everything including drinks and food had to be done at the bar. This meant that for all sports nuts, getting refreshments resulted in interrupted game watching, or interrupted game dishing during commercials. Since I was there more for the company than watching a game, it didn't matter as much to me, but it was still annoying having to wrestle for attention at the bar rather than just ordering from our table. \n\nThe food is standard SF sports bar fare (including token \"Asian\" offerings), at modest prices and modest portions. Despite the absent table service, the service was otherwise outstanding. One of the items we ordered was out, so they encouraged us to order not just anything else as a replacement, but EVERYTHING else we wanted to eat. Sort of ridiculous but much appreciated!\n\nLook for entrances on both Powell and Sutter, and be sure to have your ID ready.

They said they waited at the bar for over half an hour to get two pitchers of beer and that they ran out of pitchers for awhile.  After this we were unable to find somewhere to sit so we awkwardly shuffled out of peoples way until we could find a table. Another group of friends of mine had to wait in line for about 45 minutes to get inside and by that point there was no line at the bar and there was plenty of room so I have no idea why they made them wait so long.  When they got there we went back to the bar for another drink and the bartenders were more interested into talking to themselves than helping the guests.

This place might have gotten at least 3 stars for the drinks and bar service.  We sat among sticky tables and dirty glasses everywhere.  There were no servers taking orders, so we went to the bar.\n\nOne big problem... They don't have a \"last call,\" so if you buy a drink right before midnight (that's right, they closed at midnight on a Friday night.), you won't have time to drink it before this ridiculous security guard starts yelling for people to \"STAND UP!  EVERYBODY MOVE TO THE EXIT!  I SAID MOVE!\"  \n\nHonestly, it sounded like we were in the middle of a robbery...or some theatrical Alcatraz tour!  The patrons inside were not loud or unruly, and he treated everyone like criminals.  Several folks had just gotten a drink, and now they are being told that the bar is closed...get out!  \n\nIf you close at midnight, fine...but post the hours and stop selling drinks before people need to leave.  Don't take customers' money and then force them out.  \n\nThe staff tried to explain that they had apparently been too lenient in the past.  Um...I have to say that there has to be a middle ground somewhere.  From the reaction everyone had as we were being forced out, it's safe to say that these folks will never return.  A few more nights like that, and Golden Gate Tap Room won't have to worry about customers staying late....or, any customers at all.\n\nThis guy left a bitter taste in everyone's mouth...shame on the management for letting this happen.

Now, we don't frequent dive bars, more so of places like Roka, Barrique, Cigar Bar, Press Club, Trace, where service and atmosphere are more up there.  But this Golden Gate Tap, it's pretty much half divy, half brewery, kinda like Thirsty Bear? Except TB is much nicer and has a more sophisticated menu. \n\nAnyway, we got there around 6pm and luckily found a long table next to the bar, of course given the look of the place, didn't think the staff is well trained enough to greet us or take our orders even though menus were on the table. So we ordered food at the bar and bought our bracelet for the $10 unlimited beer at another table where we each SHOWED OUR IDs for exchange of the red paper bracelet placed snugly around our wrist proving that we are over 21 of age.\n\nThe unlimited beer was only limited to Pilsner and the bartenders repeated that it will run out of supply shortly and will stop serving once it's out like it's some kind of freaking life blood. We dont give a F.  One of us decided to get a round of shots so he went to the bar to get shots.. came back after 10 min to COLLECT OUR IDs because even though he's wearing the beer bracelet, they believe that the rest of us might be 18? *BUZZ KILL 1*\n\nAbout 20 min after the first round, I decided to get the second round and TOOK OUR IDs with me *BUZZ KILL 2* This time we diidnt want all vodka, I ordered 2 Jameson, 4 Vodkas with Pineapple backs. She repeated my order back questionably and in the most miserably state poured my backs *BUZZ KILL 3* \n\nAfter my experience I went back to my table, and yes every single person agreed that those 2 female bartenders were extremely rude, useless, snappy and premium buzz killers. Maybe they just got out of jail? Maybe they have something against ppl like us? Maybe they just broke up with each other? We dont fkn care cuz we pay your bills so you better shape up! or not?

Honestly, 2 stars is extremely nice for the experience a group of my friends and I had.  \n\nLet me start out by saying this would be the perfect sports bar on SF if it actually played the volume to the game. Seriously... No volume? And just because it's not a niners game? Since when are the warriors not just as important? Rude! The manager has absolutely no idea what he is doing. He literally told me that because other people at the bar preferred music (not even hip music, but old 70s and 80s music), he wouldn't turn on the volume for the Warriors playing the best east coast team. I was shocked, literally shocked. I came with a good group of people where we weren't shy to order tons of drinks and food. Why were the \"others\" granted their music at a sports bar?\n\nLet's talk about the food. My friend and I ordered the check in nachos (don't bother - so nasty), the veggie potstickers, popcorn shrimp and he had the burger. Somehow, after a few of us eating this, we were all feeling pretty ill the next day. I do not recommend you ordering the food! \n\nAlso, the place reeked of marihuana. I swear, it was the wait staff because after ordering a beer and asking for a glass and not receiving either or for a good 15 minutes made it quite clear who wasn't all the way there. There were too many times where my group had to go to the bar instead of having our waitress help us. \n\nAll on all, the venue is amazing and that's why I am giving it 2 stars. Get a new manager, wait staff and stop serving nasty food and you will succeed. Oh, and maybe play the actual volume to the sports game since you're a sports bar. Thanks!", "author": "Anastasia N."}

I asked the bar tender why is that area reserved as I was told no 2 nights prior to that? He said one of the \"upper managers\" reserved the area for his family. I told the bar tender what happened 2 nights ago and why does the manager get to reserve the main area when you know most the drinks and food will be free. The area was empty but just 5-7 people and the rest of the bar is packed! \n\nIt would be nice to see the owners of the bar there seeing how much money they are losing by the dumbass manager taking up the most prime seating during a big game.

I actually got sick about an hour after eating. \n\nSecond experience (thought I'd give it another go): \n\nYesterday we went in for a few drinks and had a couple of friends meeting up with us. I was the first to arrive and sat at the table for 15 minutes!!!!!!! Several times the dark haired girl with the lace-back shirt walked past me. My party arrived, still no service. Finally, I walked up to the bar and ordered our beers, albeit took 2 minutes to flag one of the bartenders down who were talking among themselves. I didn't even bother ordering an appetizer after the last experience, not to mention I wasn't wanting to be my own waitress. As I'm waiting for my beer, I see the same (only server I guess) on her phone texting. Was this a joke? I even said loudly as I carried all the beers to the table that whoever was the waitress should TIP ME for doing HER job. Again, our beers were poured in warm glasses. We only drank half of our warm beers and we left. It was seriously that bad.\n\nI thought the first experience was bad, but I thought that maybe it was just an off night. I've come to realize that the bartenders have attitude (except for the guy with the mustache who was actually cool) and the servers are nothing but useless, teenage acting girls who sit at the end of the bar chatting it up with each other or texting on their phones. \n\nDon't come here for the food that may make you sick, the warm beer and the terrible service. Sorry guy with the mustache, you should probably either work somewhere else or tell everyone else there to get there $hit together. We won't be back.", "author": "Noneya B."}

The bartenders were really friendly and walked my gf through their extensive beer collection. I was a little disappointed they were out of Tricerahops as it's one of my favorites but that was just a minor setback. The food looked bland and not exciting so we stuck to drinks.\n\nThe arcade games and game tables are spread all throughout the place.

Sat at the bar and got our drinks and put in a food order. The bartender that served us was ending his shift so he asked us to cash out. We had no problem doing this so we did. Waited for 2 appetizers for about 30-40 minutes, the food was disgusting but we were starving so we didn't care and ate it, also we had already paid for it. The 2 new bartenders that came on never acknowledged us, so we never got another drink. They did not appear to want to be working. The girl bartender was chomping her gum so bad, I'm not really sure she could focus on anything else. As we were leaving the GM said to a customer \"that we are kinda a bar\". The place is a sports bar, that only was playing soccer, even though baseball and basketball games were staring.

There were a moderate amount of people there - about 150. A girl in my party ordered a bunch of appetizers and our whole group (8 people) ordered drinks. After 20-30 minutes a server brought our food-which is a long time to wait for fries and chicken wings. The girl who ordered said the food didnt look right, but maybe she had forgotten what she had ordered bc she ordered almost one of everything, so our group dug in. After a few minutes, the head waitress walked past our table a few times and then stopped to talk to the server who brought our food. The head waitress then came over to our table and said, \"this order wasn't for this table, it goes to that table over there.\" (she wasnt rude at all, just informative) \n\nHere's the kicker:\n\nShe picks up 3 of the 4 plates from our table, the ones we have already  eaten off of, and walks over to a table about 40 feet from us and serves that food to the other customers...THE FOOD WE HAVE ALREADY TOUCHED/EATEN OFF OF!\n\nNow, everyone in my group works in the food industry and were completely appalled by what had just happened. 10 min later our actual order arrived, and after waiting almost 50 minutes for food we were sort of irritated. \n\nThe food in general was just bad.

The sweet potato fries were cold and soggy. The chicken wings were congealed, the calamari was overcooked and the taco meat was dry. \n\nThe mixed drinks, from our group consensus were not by any means bar-worthy.

He tried to take my order again and yelled \"What do you want?\" and as I repeated my order he yells \"you have to speak up you're at a bar\". K, Mr. Rude Bartender.

After we complained for the 4th time, the manager came and offered to give us extra appetizers for free. At least he made some effort, but frankly the whole order should have been free. The food that came was barely edible. Boneless teriyaki wings were cold and bland. Chicken fingers had been left in the deep fryer too long and tasted burnt. Nachos were awful; canned cheese with burnt bacon and a couple chopped tomatoes. Even with the free extras, the food wasn't worth more than $5 all together, and the check for the 2 terrible original appetizers was $17.\n\n-When our server disappeared for long periods of time, we tried getting beers at the bar, but it was near impossible. Multiple times I waited at the bar trying to get a beer for 20+ minutes (not exaggerating) and just gave up. It turned into people waving money in the air every time a bartender looked up.\n\nFrankly, even though the service was bad, I don't know what the servers or bartenders could have done.

There is a big emphasis On sports but that is not even an issue because I dig basketball/baseball and football. This place clearly caters to men, or young women. The bathroom was missing toilet paper. We sat at the bar for 5-7mins and no one attended us, we then ask a waitress if we sat a high top would we get wait service...she said sure! We sat at table for 10mins...no one came. We sat back at bar. (We are really easy going ladies...patience was wearing thin) finally service...(it was 7pm on a Thursday.) the bar tender was knowledgeable and friendly! Success!

The entrance is located up a flight of stairs. The restaurant was laid back during lunch time. I was able to watch sports and grab a quick bite to eat. I had a burger with fries. I thought the burger and fries were cooked well.  It wasn't the greatest burger but definitely good. Food prices are reasonable. There are a variety of beers on tap (great selection). The bartender was attentive. The restaurant has multiple televisions throughout (great for watching sports). Customers can play skee ball as well. There's a wheel behind the bar labeled with beers and shots. Customer can pay to spin the wheel and win a beer or shot. That's a cool idea for a sports bar in my opinion. The Golden Gate Tap Room is a good choice for watching sports and drinks/food. I give Golden Gate Tap Room a 3.5 rating.", "author": "Dominic B."}

Three times on a Saturday afternoon, and once on a Thursday night. \n\nThe three Saturday afternoons were great. There were a fair number of people, plenty of games on, and drinking games to play all over. Like a Dave and Buster's in a really amazing location with a bit more upscale vibe. The big projector screens had plenty of seating, so I was able to get perfect seats for all the big games. A great bar environment that is worth checking out on a casual weekend.\n\nThursday, however, was a disaster. My friend and I walked in and placed an order at the bar. The bartender told us to take a number to the table of our choice, so we sat alongside the Powell Street wall (opposite side of the bar). We closed out our tab there at the bar and our food came as promised.\n\nTwo other couples were at tables next to us. Every table took turns flagging down servers, bus boys, and even patrons who looked like they might be waiters. It was impossible to get an additional order taken. My friend and I wanted drinks, so I looked around for an employee to notify.\n\nI stopped a very busy waitress twice to insist that she take my order, but she kept insisting that she wasn't my server. I understand that my order isn't her direct responsibility, but someone needs to be concerned with how long people wait to get a glass of water, place an order, or even make a complaint.\n\nA long time later, a new waitress finally came by to take one order. ONE. And then she left. She did not return for a long time, and when she did, it was to deliver the first table's food. I waved to her as she walked away to a private party, ignoring me. We waited longer. No dice. We got up and left.\n\nI wasted more than 45 minutes in that bar without being able to order a drink. No water refill, no alcohol, no extra food. Nothing. I hope it was someone's first day, because I can't think of any other reason for such a performance.", "author": "Jared S."}

I always come here to watch big games and normally come with a big group of friends. It's the kickback spot. I've never had any complaints since I love the atmosphere and the workers, but today was an exception. \n\nNormally the staff is really nice, but today, since the get-go our \"redhead\" waitress was really sassy and rude. I came with a group of friends which had to eat and leave early for a concert, but I stayed with a friend to finish watching the Sunday night football game. Since my friends were in a hurry they got up to pay and thats when our waitress got ticked off. Place was understaffed tonight, so obviously she was stressed out about that (not my fault so don't take it out on me), but then when she came back she didn't give us our change. When asked for it she started yapping about tip which we were going to do, but she lost it once she started complaining to us and being rude. I had never had a waitress harass me over a tip before and I could not help, but laugh that she was really losing all manners and losing the reputation I had for this place over a couple of dollars. She might as well have begged us for change...\n\nWhat pissed me off was the fact that I was still drinking a beer and she came and took it and threw it out. I got up and complained to the bartenders and spoke to the manager, who were apologetic, but didn't really seem to care, and I left under the impression that I am not the first person to complain. After reading a couple of yelp reviews I realized I'm not the first person to realize that this place is understaffed and their servers are a**holes. \n\nLike I said, this place is cool and when I've eaten here the food is good. I had nothing but good memories here, but today was a joke. I know it was because of a dumb redhead waitress, but not coming back here. I'm honestly surprised that women got hired with that attitude, and if it was because of her looks, then they need to reconsider hiring, because she's not very appealing to the eye.", "author": "Carlo J."}

I really enjoyed the atmosphere and the bartenders but this review is not a reflection of that. \n\nI did some research and decided this would be a great place to watch the finals of the World Cup. We got there early because we knew it would be busy and found a table. Everything was pretty cool until we tried to order food. This review is entirely based is on the service and how they treated us. Our waitress told us we couldn't purchase a la carte items, but we could pay $20 upstairs for a buffet. Keep in mind if we had ordered about 4-5 things for our table it would have been about $20-30 total for a table. Not wanting to do that because it was a rip-off and because that is NOT what was advertised on their website, a staff member told us it was fine for one person to purchase a ticket to the buffet and for the table to share. We had seen at least 3 other tables do this. Well about 30 minutes later this angry man comes and tells each of us who had been eating have to pay $20 each. He was extremely rude when he came over and we tried to explain what happened and what another staff member had told us. He didn't make us pay the $20 but he was angry about it and had someone take the plate of food away after we told him we wouldn't eat anymore besides the person who paid for it. \n\nThe thing that makes me upset is this is not a result of anything I or fellow customers did but the lack of communication regarding staff members. The manager/owner changed the policy to make everyone pay $20 for bar food- wings and fries when they normally have these available a la cart. In addition, instead of being nice about the whole thing, the person who spoke to us was a jerk, plains and simple. Everyone at our table was quite taken aback and we will NOT be recommending this place to any of our friends for the simple reason that customer service made us feel disrespected.  \n\nI understand the manager sometimes posts to poor reviews and apologizes, but this was something that should have been thought about before a busy weekend.  Had we just been able to purchase some fries and nachos, it would have been the same price we paid for the buffett and I would be giving rave reviews about this place.", "author": "Lori M."}

It's also very large, making it a good spot for a party or large group to catch a game or play pool. Here\ns where the two stars come from: 1) The service was terrible - our waitress was perfectly nice but every round took FOREVER, and our drinks arrived watery with all the ice practically melted - no good bartender or waitress would let drinks go to the table like that. No apologies when I complained. At around 7:45 PM we ordered a few appetizers, and only after we complained how long they were taking did they admit the order hadn't gone in. The food finally arrived around 8:45...and they didn't comp a thing! and 2) Speaking of the food that almost didn't arrive, it was terrible.

I went in a bit worried because the woman I had been emailing with was very slow to respond and was pretty unclear about everything, but when I got there and met with the bar manager (Craig?) I was very happily surprised by the service.  \n\nThey'd reserved two big spaces for us along with a pool table that you can rent for $5/hour.  I thought I'd also reserved a shuffleboard table, but that seems to have fallen through the cracks in my emails with Vanessa.  When I told the manager that I'd have liked one, he made it happen and we happily played pool and shuffleboard all night while watching Monday Night Football on a big projector screen.  \n\nI had also been confused about the food situation (get your menus online, ggtr!) and thought the restaurant the floor above served food in the tap room.  They don't, but the manager made it happen for us when he really didn't need to.  They also thought ahead and had wristbands available for the group to make it very easy to order at the bar.  He went way above and beyond in making sure my group had a great time and I'm really appreciative of it.   \n\nFood, beer and bartenders were all great.  Loved having all the games, there was really something for everyone and the management really really impressed me.  Definitely recommend it for anyone, but particularly for groups.", "author": "Alison H."}

WhooOoo!!! Go Warriors!! =)) Because this game was going to determine whether there would be a game 7 or not, it was crazy packed in here! Luckily my friend's boyfriend was able to get a table on the 3rd floor. I was here for the last game as well on a Sunday and it was pretty busy that night too. So not only is this place huge but there are alot of screens here, which made it a perfect hangout spot to watch the game. The servers/bartenders here are pretty awesome and nice too. I was really hungry and wanted to order some food but our server said that the kitchen was really backed up and that they wouldn't be able to take any more orders for another 20 minutes. I was ok with that because it was totally understandable and Im just glad that she told me that instead of just taking my order and me wondering where the heck my food is. Loll anyways the crowd was great and very lively. While waiting to order for food, we just got pitchers of beers and drinks first and watched the game. After we were finally able to order food, the food actually came out fairly quickly! I got the buffalo boneless chicken wings and the garlic fries. The fries were really good and the chicken was also but it was a little too spicy for me. Anyways when the Warriors won the game, everyone in the bar was celebrating and cheering!

The ambiance is really cool, they have arcade games, pool and skee ball (love me some skee ball), but the games are kinda pricey.  \n\nIt took FOREVER to get a drink!  The bartenders were clearly drunk, flirting with some girls at the bar and ignoring the other customers.  I think it was about 10pm, and we were hungry, so we tried to order some food off their menu (including the check-in on Yelp for free nachos, which proved useless), only to be told that they had stopped serving food already.  The first two beers we chose from the large menu posted on the wall behind the bar were unavailable- they were out of one and don't carry the other anymore.  The personality of the bartender that finally got around to helping me, left something to be desired.  I don't expect warm & fuzzy, but you tend to want a pleasant bartender who is happy to help you and doesn't act as though you're a nuisance because you're not one of those flirty co-eds at the other end of the bar.  \n\nThe \"wheel of beer\" is a nice touch...it was fun to spin, though they spin it for you rather than you getting to spin it.  I think that was our favorite part of the whole experience.  I might give this place another try, but the bartenders really need to step up their game and not be so discriminatory.  They clearly have tunnel vision for the customers they prefer to serve, and that is no way to run a business. It would also be nice if they served food until closing.

GGTR carries just about every sport too, which is great, but they leave the same game on every channel. We asked them to change to the Nets game (Brooklyn represent), but every other TV/screen had the same CIT tournament game on (for the casual fan, this is not even the NIT of second tier college basketball tournament games).

Pool, shuffleboard and skeeball a plus.\n\nCocktail waitresses are horrible. Sat with my girlfriend for 20 min at our high top table on a very slow Sunday before realizing no one was going to help us.  I went to the bar and asked if I should just order from them and he said a cocktail waitress would be by any minute. Waited 5 more minutes while watching the waitresses help the table next to us and a few others while constantly walking past us, even making eye contact then looking away. I ended up just ordering everything from the bar and walking across the huge room back and forth myself.  I've been in the industry for 17 years and over tip like crazy.. Their loss.  What's worse is everytime I went to the bar I'd see the cocktail waitresses leaned back texting or whatever on their phones and playing around while there were multiple tables on the floor unattended and looking lost. This has happened on more than one occasion. I'm not sure how they decide who to help and who to not help but the service is pretty horrible/non-existent. Maybe they just don't like money. Could be sooo much better with a better staff.  Seems very poorly managed. Bartenders have been decent though.\n\nFood is nothing special. Regular sports bar food. Don't eat the tacos. Very bland and unappealing. Spicy ribs are ok though. Everything else is average.\n\nYou guys are new and have potential to be very awesome. Please get rid of the lazy cocktail waitresses and get some new blood in that shows great hospitality and acts like they give a crap about their job. Otherwise you may be doomed.

To my disappointment, management has turned over. Rather than confirming my reservations, the new manager responded that they are working on securing game watches other than Miami at GGTap. I found this ungracious and rude, especially considering last season in which we brought 30-75 people during non-peak times. Trying to salvage the partnership, I thanked the manager for the heads up. She then responded she will not guarantee sound and that our first game coincides with a Big Ten game which she found bigger and more important (even though our game is on ABC). There was no reservation attempt for this game, the manager simply felt it was more important. I called Tap hoping to understand why we are getting so much push back for trying to renew GGTap as a Hurricane bar which we had been advertising up to this point. Rather than trying to apologize for a misinterpreted email, which I expected, the manager was defensive and arrogant. She repeatedly told me she used to work at another Sports Bar and knows which games are more important. \n\nApart from being quite insulting to the University of Miami athletic program (which boasts 5 national championships), I am completely shocked at the response I received from GGTap. We had such a positive experience last year, coming every weekend for an entire season, and getting to know the previous managers and servers. New management seems to forget the service in a service industry. Regardless of this manager's personal opinion on which athletic programs are \"important,\" as I patron and a person I expected a little more respect.", "author": "Samantha K."}

I live in Los Altos but work in the city so it's rare that I get to go out like I did in my pre-kid days. After reading a review on SF Eater about their soft launch some co-workers and I decided to head over for happy hour before it gets too touristy.\n\nThe concept was great! Shuffleboard, skiball, pool tables. What's there to not like? Well they clearly weren't ready for even a soft opening. The food and food service was particularly bad. I ordered 2 orders of tacos and 1 order of potstickers at the bar and paid cash. When the food arrived there were 2 orders of pot stickers and no tacos. The waiter informed me they were out of tacos but since I had paid cash I'd have to go talk to the bartender. He was nice enough and told me to just order 2 other items. I went with short ribs and a smoked salmon plate. The salmon arrived with no bread or crackers or anything, just a pile of salmon and a dollop of mayo (no silverware or napkins in sight either). When I asked how it was supposed eat it the waiter looked confused and said \"I guess I could bring you some bread.\" He delivered 3 paper thin pieces of bread that wasn't even enough for a 1/4 of the salmon. \n\nI guess with their food you get what you pay for. It seemed oddly cheap compared to the $6-7 beers.\n\nThe system for checking out shuffleboard pucks was really unorganized too. One of the two tables went unused for over 30 minutes and when we inquired at the bar as to it's availability we were met with blank stares and told they didn't know who had the set for that table. \n\nWe left having played a single game of skiball and longing for a decent bite to eat.", "author": "Elena M."}

Totally understand things would be slower but we waited one hour and 15 minutes for our waitress, when I finally asked when we can expect help I was told there were not enough servers and I should just go order at the bar myself (which took another 20 minutes to get to the front of the bar) and another 45 minutes for 3 appetizers. \n\nOther negative is the line!! They decided to capitalize on these large sporting events and now charge $10 to get in, in return you can use this $10 on your first drink. This process REALLLLLLY slows the line down! Seems alil silly to charge at a sports bar especially when the service is so crappy! \n\nNot sure if it is a capacity thing but there is SOOOOOOO much wasted space in this place, there are entire room with massive big screen TVs and no chairs, I find it hard to believe that their capacity is so low for such a large space - who knows.

We had roughly a dozen in our group, and scored a seat in front of the largest of the TV's. We thought we had it made, but I could not be more mistaken.\n\nAs other reviewers have noted, the service here is terrible if existent at all. There's only one tiny bar on each floor which attempts to serve probably 300-400 people a piece. Some bartenders try to stay upbeat, but half of them are crumbling under the pressure and cramped space. One bartender on the third floor was even vengeful, and actually skipped the people who had been waiting the longest multiple times, presumably for trying to get his attention (heaven forbid). Getting a beer took over 20 mins each time because we were forced to use the bar. We never saw a server once.\n\nAlso, they had the foresight to schedule a reservation at 8pm using the seats we were sitting in. We were kicked out of our seats in the seventh inning of a World Series game!!!

I'd recommend eating elsewhere or ordering 3-4 dishes per person if you want to actually eat dinner.\n4) They lost our food order, then finally a half hour later, brought us someone else's order (sorry poor people who were staring at us knowing that was their food).  We told them, and they let it sit there for 10 mins, then came around and took it to the other table.

If GG Tap Room was in Sacramento, it would be the hottest thing going. It would also probably not be called \"Golden Gate\", but I digress. The special lady and I stumbled in here on a recent visit and were super excited about the find. Bricks, exposed wood and leather banquettes give the place an old-school, manly vibe. Skeeball and vintage arcade games give it a retro-nerd touch. A good selection of on-tap beers make it a worthwhile stop for hop-heads. Beer-and-a-shot specials give the douche-bags and alkies something to look forward to. A giant screen playing sports games make sure that sports fans have something to talk about instead of just standing around mouth-breathing. The pool table and shuffle-board round out the package. The line for beer was a little disorganized and they could have used another person on staff, but we still had a few beers and a snack from the small but rad food-menu in a reasonable amount of time. They also had a yelp check-in offer for potato chip nachos that was a very pleasant surprise. I'll definitely go back and recommend it to others.", "author": "Logan J."}

(there was a good amount of food on the plate still.) \n\nthat was the last straw, and i actually left pretty pissed. i really, i mean REALLY wanted to love this place. i tried to push things back, justify things in my mind, but all in all it was pretty bad. i won't be back, and sadly don't see things taking off if the staff doesn't change.", "author": "Lex B."}

I sat down at a table, and waited...and waited...and waited.  20 minutes later a server walks by and looks at me, notices I don't have a drink in front of me...and walks on by.  When I ask to have my game on the nearest TV, since nobody else is looking at it, I'm told to move to another TV.   The TV I get has cable or satellite connection problems and locks up, and I miss the entire 2nd quarter of my game.  Another person watching the game went up to the cashier station and asked for help.   No follow up.  I walk up to the cashier station and ask for help.  No follow up.  Server walks by and I wave her down.  She says she forgot and then walks away.  No follow up.  I go find two young looking dudes with ties on...they look like management or maybe ownership.  They finally help me out.  What the fuck is the matter with your servers?  Why aren't you hiring more and better staff?  Not returning....ever.", "author": "Kurt L."}

Third time getting absolutely ignored here. 2nd level bartenders, shorter guy with glasses and brunette chick with tatts over looked one of us sitting at the actual bar, and another of us waiting in a static line for drinks. Got tired of it and wanted to leave. Took 20 minutes to close the bill just to leave after waiting. Tried the third floor due to being thirsty and hungry - the bartender was busting his ass even though the floor was half empty. However, after trying to get food for nearly 30 minutes from a server (Harland or Harlem was her name, something like that, told to us from the bartender after being told we have to order food from her and not him) we just had to leave. Went to a place down the street that was awesome. Check my other reviews to see where. I work in the industry and have a ton of patience and can totally feel for someone when they're in the weeds. These people, however are just slow, rude and are costing the company money from where I stand. Could've gotten a meal, drinks and return customers had everything gone well.", "author": "Dustin D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-07", "description": "Went here last night. Definitely left a bad taste and I'll probably never come back.\n\nMy friends get to the bar and it's a bit crowded, but not crazy busy to the point that we waited as long as we did. There were two bartenders. We're standing on left end of the bar, and had to wait till the bartender with the hat all the way on the other side acknowledged us and took are drinks order. I wondered why the bartender in the black shirt and mustache on our side couldn't help us since there was only 3 of us, but I dismissed it. It was a chunk of time to wait. No stars for that.\n\nThere was another point in the night where I noticed that there was a broken glass on the corner next to one of the games. Pretty dangerous I would say since huge chunks of glass were pointing straight up. I tried to get one of the waitress' attention, but she just whizzed right by me. I don't think it was that loud in there that she couldn't here me, but whatever. We went back to the bar to get more drinks and let the bartender know about the issue.\n\nThis time I was standing right smack in the middle of the bar, so he had to have seen me. Nope. NO acknowledgement what so ever from the same black shirt bartender even after he helped the guy right next to me who just sits down a little bit after I get there. There were several points during waiting people would walk about away, new people would show up and he would help them. Not even looking me. I was a bit distraught to say the least and asked my friend who is taller than me to switch places. Maybe he couldn't see my because I was short and in all black. I guess that wasn't the case because he still wouldn't help my friend either. Same thing: new people would come and he would help them instead. My friend said there was a point where he looked straight at the bartender in the face, and the guy goes on to help someone new at the bar. At this point, I've complete forgotten about the broken glass and just absolutely brimming.\n\nFinally the other bartender with the hat helps us. He was so quick because we only wanted 3 beers, so I couldn't understand why the other bartender was ignoring us. We were waiting quite a long time that we began to people watch and notice that sort of thing, I'm embarrassed to say. Considering that was the second time of the night with the same bartender disregarded us in the same fashion, I can't think of anything else.\n\nI actually think that the decor was really cool. I liked the paintings and the games were pretty fun. I think the issue is that where the shuffle board is located, you get this build up of people in a some what narrow space. However the rest of the are was roomy and comfortable. They have a various beer selection of craft beer on tap and bottle which was pretty good. So if you want a decent beer with BAD BAD service, come here.", "author": "Eve B."}

It's good bar food, but the ambiance they created is what makes it great. My only suggestion is to have one server for 2 sections.

Once seated we waited 10 minutes for someone to even recognize us. Then it all went down hill. Andre was our waiter and was rude right off the bat. He took my order and then screamed next expecting another person to speak up. He never made eye contact and he was rushing us. I asked for a sperate check at the beginning of the meal since I had to leave early and he just said flat out no. I work in a restaurant and find it easier to be notified at the beginning of the meal. Our food came, wasn't bad but half the table was done eating by the time the other food came. Tables around us with families received much better service and got their food before us even though we sat down first. Andre made an assumption that we wouldn't tip well and didn't give us the time of day. Great atmosphere and location. Horrible wait staff. Potential is there but attitudes need to change. Nothing at this place was great enough to bring me back.", "author": "Madeline M."}
