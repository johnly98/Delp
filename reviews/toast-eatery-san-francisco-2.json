Despite the poor reviews I saw on Yelp, this place was fast, efficient, and delicious!\n\nWe were seated right away, which was good because I was getting hangry. Ordered the godfather omelette. Out came a perfectly cooked egg, stuffed with Italian sausage, mushrooms, and peppers. Everything was flavorful and delicious (except the American cheese, which I would pass on next time). The hash browns were crispy on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. Went well with the hot sauce they provide. And of course, the meal wouldn't be complete without some sourdough toast -- which was served perfectly cooked, not burned. The staff was friendly and checked on us a few times, always offering to refill my coffee (which was surprisingly bold and flavorful! unusual for a diner type place).\n\nI would definitely come back here next time I'm in the area. Great food, good prices, and good service.", "author": "Sara S."}

We happened upon Toast by accident, since we originally planned on going to Griddle Fresh...but after eating realized it was Toast. How hilarious! Their signage says eat Toast, which is pretty cute and not as \"telltale\" of the name as I thought. All inside the space they have graffiti/street art by this famous SF artist and pieces of toast animated and pictured. The vibe is definitely family-friendly, and very cozy and low-key--exactly what we needed.\n\nBoo was hungover from the night before, and I was pretty hungry and was looking for some hearty grub. We decided to share the regular french toast (with added fruit) and the salmon scramble which was SO delicious and great in portion size. We got the scramble with english muffins, so we essentially made our own benny's with scrambled eggs which tasted really good. The hash browns could have been served in greater amount, but they are crispy and yummy. They also have brunch items like benny's, sandwiches, pancakes, and the like.\n\nToast is actually as it is. There's nothing extra remarkable about it or the food. Our server was a kind girl who seemed to have so many tables to keep track of. She got her job done, but we didn't get any homey treatment because they did seem understaffed. The only things that could be improved are the house coffee (said the boo) and perhaps providing heaters for outdoor seating. However, Toast is more like a diner than a SF breakfast place...which is a great option especially in Noe Valley.", "author": "Jodi H."}

It's always such a guessing game on what to get. I got the wet burrito before - bland, lack of good flavor. I got the regular breakfast combo with French toast and hot links today. \n\nThe hasbrowns were stale, and my sausage was totally burnt. It's a good thing I flipped the sausage over to see how the other side was, or I would have had a nasty surprise. They were nice enough to give me a new sausage. I overheard the table behind me that the waiter brought out the wrong item for the gentleman, so they had to do that one over too.\n\nI'm not bashing on the people who work here, but more am wanting to bring to attention that this place really lacks consistency, and honestly, needs a good manager to be on site to help bring this place up to it's full potential.\n\nEven the music in the background was so confusing that I actually noticed how weird it was. I could hear the sound of the tv, and the music playing on the speakers. The weirdest part though was, that the kitchen was playing music that was totally different, and I thought it was inappropriate considering that all the customers could hear it. \n\nI've been to the other toast location - that one has way better customer service.

However, I usually find that the tofu scrambles are quite bland and find myself dumping loads of hot sauce on my plate to compensate, though I'm still never completely happy with the scramble at the end. The scrambles come with delicious hash browns that are made with oil (not butter); however, these can be hit or miss as last time mine were overcooked and minuscule.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-09", "description": "Toast is a dependable bet for solid food for Breakfast or Lunch. Note that I sent solid and not extraordinary. Toast really reminds me of a traditional New England luncheonette but more modern and with more avocado. The menu has a large selection of omelettes and scrambles as well as traditional breakfast staples like pancakes. For lunch, there are a ton of sandwiches and burgers to choose from as well as a few salads.\n\nBoth times that I have come for breakfast, I have gotten omelettes. Both omelettes have been good. The potatoes served with them are fine. Toast is toast. The price is fair for what it is and the portions are big. But again, everything is fine. If you need breakfast and everywhere else has a wait, Toast is a suitable option. If you can get into Griddle Fresh or Chloe's though, you are definitely better off. I have yet to come for lunch so maybe that is their strong suit but who knows.\n\nI will say that they REALLY cram you in at this location. It is so tight that the waiters and waitresses can't get to you easily. We once sat in the back corner and our waitress literally had to pass our food and I never go refills on my coffee even though it was empty before we got our food. I understand this isn't her fault but I really think it would make everyone happier if one or two tables were removed.\n\nTLDR: This place is adequate but don't expect anything past that.", "author": "Carrie W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-08-06", "description": "Recommendation: Thinking about going to Toast Eatery? Perhaps you will enjoy it. However, the costs, inconsistent food quality, long lines, unpleasant deep fryer oil flavor, and frequently feeling annoyed at the end of my meal will keep me from retuning or recommending that you eat at any of the Toast locations. I've been a Toast customer probably as long as they have been in San Francisco but I don't recall if there is one owner for all Toast restaurants and since there isn't one single Toast Yelp page, I chose the 24th Street Toast Yelp page to post my review because it is my least favorite Toast location.\n\nPros & Cons: On the surface, Toast is the kind of place you consider going to for breakfast or lunch because of the convenient locations scattered around the city and a menu that is varied enough for most tastes. But that's where the positive attributes end. The quality of the service and food is widely inconsistent even when I primarily went to the Church Street Toast location for many years. The frequent long wait times for a table (often 30 minutes or more on weekends) and mediocre food is extremely frustrating given the costs (especially the $3.50 ice tea!). Whatever oil they use in the deep fryer has an off-putting flavor that lingers in my mouth long after the meal. It is so bad that I finally stopped ordering fried food even though I loved their fried menu items like the curly fries.\n\nI tried the 24th Street location numerous times and in addition to the extremely loud and chaotic environment, every meal was incorrectly prepared. It is the one location that I have never enjoyed. The Polk Street location was simply unwelcoming. I often felt as though I was somehow imposing on the staff who did little more than mumble through our interactions. In contrast, the staff at the Church Street and West Portal locations are welcoming, kind, and try very hard to accommodate each guest. Both environments are much less chaotic with the exception of the parent patrons who often allow their children to fulfill every impulse like running around unsupervised or play with all of the table condiments, like jellies, throughout their meals without a care for other diners but that is not the fault of the Toast staff who try very hard to respectfully intervene.\n\nToast was initially a great find but years later, it's just a frustrating waste of money.", "author": "Thatwasme T."}

My cousin told him that the rest of our group was looking for parking and would be here in a few minutes which they did. So when we sat we immediately ordered 4 coffees, 2 orange juices and 5 waters and waited for the rest of our group to come patiently. When we finally ordered their was an impression that the waitress was upset was us so my cousin asked if they were upset with us. She immediately became defensive and said that she was not upset but that their was frustration because other tables couldn't get served because of our entire group not being there on the spot (even though it was only 5 minutes). That made us extremely uncomfortable and my cousin just said we understand to try and ease the tension. Mind you all 5 of us each ordered an entr\u00e9e and the bill came out to 73 dollars. \n\nSo when our food finally came after 20 minutes and during that time we can overhear some of the cooks looking in our direction and talking about us. The waitress didn't really talk to us until we were paying the bill. So when we paid our 73 dollar bill she \"apologized\" about her attitude. the apology didn't really matter because it was too late and it seemed to us she was only apologizing just to try and get a tip. \n\nThe overall experience today was very bad. Their was negative energy, bad attitude and just a lack of professionalism in this establishment. We were very patient and polite so the service we were getting back was terrible. We gave a 25 dollar tip to send a message that despite the bad service, bad attitude and a clear attempt to get a tip we will still show politeness and professionalism when the servers can't do that.", "author": "Mohammad A."}

Very friendly service and our food only took about 10-15 minutes to come out, and we were STARVING so that was good.\n\nFood: My Girlfriend ordered the California Burger, medium rare with bacon and garlic fries. I ordered the French Dip with a side of Garlic fries as well.\nCali Burger: Cooked to perfection! It actually doesn't come with bacon, but if you add bacon it's the perfect combo. It's still delicious without it, but for you bacon lovers, it's great. The patty was tender and juicy and the cheese was soft and chewy. The avocados were super fresh and if blended nicely with the burger. The garlic fries were OK, she wasn't too impressed with them and neither was I, so I would personally opt for the regular fries (They were also a dollar extra).\nThe French Dip: Very heavy, but enjoyable.

I could only manage one slice but took home the rest. My Noe Valley scramble was good, but the real star of the show was the hash browns. They were incredible! Perfectly flavored and cooked. I'd have been delighted with a whole meal that was just a huge vat of those hash browns.\n\nI'd have given Toast Eatery four stars, but I give it three because our service was a little slow and inattentive. I was trying to order a dessert, but the server didn't notice or ask and just gave us a bill. I ended up having to pay twice... a little annoying. I'd still come back and just get a huge order of hash browns and coffee on some greasy, indulgent morning!", "author": "Denise B."}

I barely ever eat burgers, so said what the hell do it. Thank you friend for flaking on our dinner plans because THIS WAS THE BEST TURKEY BOCA i've ever put in my hugry mouth. My Turkey Burger was california style so it had avocado and swiss cheese. The patty was SO juicy and tender. This item just suprised my palate, it was THAT good. I scarfed that sucka down like there aint no tomorrow. Screw my strict eatings, cardio, and my daily 100 sit-ups tonight. All worth it!\n\nWill I be back?

Completely bland, unseasoned, barely cooked, enormous squares of tofu hardly constitutes a \"scramble\". Paired with flavorless veggies, it was barely edible.

There is new staff in the kitchen and new servers, and things have gotten much much better both in terms of consistency of the food and service quality. \n\nPrior outdated review is below:\n\nThere are three other much better breakfast locations in Noe, but unfortunately Toast opens an hour earlier so has a monopoly on the 7-8am crowd.\n\nTheir new server (guy there since last summer when Meagan left) makes errors in our order almost every single week; he just doesn't listen.  God forbid you order tea - you can absolutely forget about anyone offering you more hot water for the duration of your breakfast. For that matter, you have to flag down the staff for just about everything you need, including the check.\n\nThe style of food prep varies occasionally, which isn't a big deal unless you - like me - draw the line at what actual ingredients end up on your plate.  Maybe they thought it was 'bonus flavor' to cook my breakfast on bacon grease one day, but since I haven't eaten meat in 20 years, I really can't digest it anymore and was left with stomach cramps and nausea for about 3 hours.  Try at least wiping off the griddle between customers?  Definitely NOT recommended for anyone with food allergies!!\n\nIf only Savor, LeZinc or Griddle Fresh opened earlier..", "author": "Lester N."}

I have traveled the land sampling this truly ninth wonder of the world, and have come to find this. I have enjoyed a torani bacon flavored milkshake in Alabama, buffalo-wing flavored in Kansas City, pancaked soy flavored in Tokyo, sweet potato flavored in Idaho, avocado flavored in Chile, butter chicken flavored in Mumbai, rau muong flavored in Vietnam, Vodka flavored(although looking back that might of been a white russian smoothie) in Moscow, and Kushari flavored in Egypt. However after tasting all of these incredibly unique milkshakes in every corner of the world, when asked by some of my esteemed colleagues which one was my favorite. I simply replied, The strawberry milkshake at Toast in the Noe Valley neighborhood of San Francisco. It had a thickness that was unparalleled. A creaminess second to none. A perfect Albion strawberry flavoring that would make the Queen of England step down. \n           Having said all that, that wasnt the only component that lead me to this decision. The final piece of the puzzle was the service. This little magenta masterpiece was served by this enchanting women named Erica.

Blame it on the mimosas, but I am probably as close as you will come to a certified brunchologist. \n\nWhen I'm in town, I frequent both the 24th Street and Church Street locations of Toast, although I have never ordered a mimosa here and don't know that they even have a liquor license.  (Really should check into that.)  They do have pretty much everything else -- from Mitchell's ice cream to cupcakes to dinner food made with fresh local ingredients. \n\nThe decor is clean and simple and they have some really flavorful organic teas.  The combination of flavors of some of their omelettes is great.  The pesto in the Sicilian is perfection with the sun-dried tomatoes, spinach and feta.  (If I weren't Jewish, I would SO be Italian.)  I also like the eponymous Church St. and the 24th St. omelettes. \n\nHowever, the egg part of the omelette is always really thin.  It's more like an egg crepe than an omelette.  I don't know if they use two or three eggs, but I'm guessing it's two and I'm also guessing that's a cost-saving decision.   On the plus side, I believe they use cage-free eggs.  Similarly, depending on the day, the Italian sausage is either like the size of my palm or a the size of one finger.   Maybe that's just how Italian sausage is, but I've dated only two Italians so I don't have much of basis for comparison (ba dah bump).  \n\nThe prices are reasonable -- most breakfast entrees are $9.75, but where they make up the difference is on the sides, which fare about $3.75.  If you tend to forgo toast and hash browns and need something else on the side to fill you up, the sides add up. \n\nOn weekends, it's easier to get a seat at the Church Street location.  Twenty-fourth almost always has a wait on Saturdays and Sundays before about 1 pm.\n\nToast has enough going for it that I will continue to spend money here.  It may be a better value for those who eat more simple carbs -- ya know, like toast.", "author": "Ms C."}

We have been here a few times and the food is ok, tasty hash browns, fries and grilled sandwich, but not worth having to put up with a rude manager.\n \nLast time we went we got there right before 11am on a Tuesday, so the place was pretty empty.  The waitress told us we could sit anywhere, in fact she pointed at the 4 chair table next to the window.  We are only 2, but decided it was a nice spot, plus there were PLENTY of 4 chair tables open.  Right after we sit down, the manager comes running over to tell us to please move to another table! She mentioned that rush hour was soon and that she might need that table.  Really? rush hour? on a Tuesday? the place was empty! Anyway, we moved tables since we were starving.  About 20 mins later, another couple sits on the same table and she does the same thing! The place is still empty! I dont know what is up with her and that table, but if your customer is sitting down, its just RUDE to ask them to move just because of the possibility of a bigger group needing the table.  I would understand if its crowded, but the place is empty!  What I really liked is that the couple refused to move and she had to serve them there.  Yes, we left about 45 mins later and the place was still empty with plenty of 4 chair tables open!\nI doubt we will be coming back, unless we are starving or ordering take out (not sure if they even do that).", "author": "J B."}

You'd probably be happy with the healthier choice, but you might kind of miss the greasy spoon taste.  That's how Toast feels to me.\n\nMy lovely lunch date Kristina had a scramble, which came with hash browns and toast - it was good.  I had the Chef's Salad with house-made poppy seed dressing.  While I could appreciate the quality of the ingredients (Niman Ranch meats), it was a little bland, and seriously under dressed.  I asked for more dressing and that helped somewhat.  We shared the apple pie for dessert which was just ok.\n\nI think they are doing well, judging by the weekday crowd that was in there the day that we went.  I can see why - it is a reliable choice.

It was also a pretty small portion, although I support their efforts at portion control. My friend ordered the salmon salad, and having asked for no bleu cheese, got a bed of greens with a formerly-frozen looking chunk of salmon and a few cherry tomatoes. Another friend commented that her salad was bland. I can't say that I need to go back. Next time, I'll check out a Noe bakery for brunch.", "author": "Emilia S."}

Today I stopped for lunch and ordered some classic Eggs Benedict. I believe that if you serve eggs benedict you know how to make it well, considering that there are 4 main ingredients: Eggs, toaster muffin, Canadian bacon, and Hollandaise sauce (which is mainly butter and lemon juice). The egg was cooked correctly and the muffin was toasted right! Yay! The bacon was too chewy and I could barely cut it. The Hollandaise sauce was horrible! Where the heck was the paprika?! It was just bland and boring. Plus, the hash browns were nothing special and sat on the plate in the shape of a square. Shouldn't it be piled high in a beautiful mound of crispy potatoes? I think so.\n\nSo the food was blah. I ate half of my food, which totaled to $12.03. However, this was only half of the bad experience I had here. The \"chef\" at the grilled was creepily staring at me the entire time I was there! It was so awkward and made my dining experience just that much worse.\n\nMy suggestion is to stay on the 48 and pass this place by...", "author": "Briza Y."}

The mushrooms tasted canned and the hash browns were one of those pre-frozen blocks. The price was too high generally but specifically because they add a 4% charge for \"San Francisco Health Ordinance\".  The prices in my opinion were high enough to cover them paying for their employees health benefit.  This is only charged to those businesses that don't (provide health insurance).

Toast has been the only restaurant successful at making me eat my hash browns.  \n\nAnyways, I came to this location and was so glad we got seated immediately.  I ordered their Corned Beef Hash with scrambled eggs, an english muffin, hash browns (of course!), and an orange juice.  I was so impressed with the size of their OJ.  A lot of places try to rip you off and give you a small little cup of juice for $3-$5.  Hell to the no!  I need my OJ for my AMs so needless to say, Toast was off to a great start.\n\nWhen my Corned Beef Hash came, I was so relieved it looked NOTHING like the Corned Beef Hash served at Craig's Place.  Toast knew how to do it right with the hash (note to Craig's: that's potatoes for you) and small strips of beef.  **Drool**  AND here's why I love their hash browns:  it's crispy on the outside all around but soft and potatoe-y on the inside!  Perfect texture!\n\nMy friend and I also ordered a side of Chicken Apple Sausage to share and I have to say, still good.  You can really taste the apples that give it a special sweetness.  Unlike Craig's.  (It's funny because Craig's Place has almost the same exact menu as Toast)\n\nMy friend ordered their Eggs Benedict which I had to try.  And just like everything else, it was very good.  \n\nI've yet to experience bad service at Toast but I must warn you, do be prepared to wait.  They usually have very long lines (at least at the Church location) that may cause you to wait 15+ minutes.  I think it's worth it.  YOU should try it out to see if it's worth it.\n\nOn the financial side (let's face it, we're all broke!), it might be considered on the pricier range.

We had two items: a blueberry waffle and the hashbrown and cheese pile; both breakfast-spot standards, and I would say pretty hard to screw up.\n\nWhen my wife's waffle arrived she commented after testing with a fork that it appeared to be a frozen waffle. I laughed - \"why would they sell a frozen waffle - it wouldn't even save them much money,\" I said. Then I tried a bite. Almost certainly a frozen waffle, unless it was left over from the day before. Rubbery, flavorless, in short awful. The blueberries were..edible. The \"real maple syrup\" we paid 2 bucks extra for was almost certainly watered down with fake maple syrup. \n\nI fared no better with my plate of hash browns, cheese, sour cream and olives. This is a plate you order for bulk, since potatoes are cheap. No bulk here: a flat pile of mealy grated potatoes maybe half an inch high, topped with a nearly equal amount of el-cheapo cheddar cheese, a glop of sour cream and a bunch of those nasty pre-sliced black olives from a can. I ate it, but only because I was hungry and I had to be somewhere soon, and the decent breakfast spot up the street was closed. But I couldn't believe I was paying almost ten bucks for this pile of canned glop.\n\nMy wife ordered a tea, which the server insisted in delivering in a tiny baby-sized cup--no pint glass or little teapot available. Would providing a bigger quantity of hot water affect Toast's bottom line? Not really; whoever designed the place just apparently doesn't drink tea himself.\n\nClearly the owners think that since they have a prime spot on 24th street in Noe Valley's main strip, they can serve whatever crap they want and rake in the money, since Noe Valley has a legal cap on the number of restaurants on 24th st. And they're probably right. People have to eat after all.\n\nBut maybe if their yelp rating dives low enough business will dry up and they'll have to sell to somebody who actually cares about feeding the customer something edible.

Served on your choice of bread (I chose wheat), the sandwich was thick with crisp crisp bacon slices (felt like 4 or 5), lettuce, tomato and avocado.

Tasty!\n\nMy friend had the humongo pastrami sandwich. It didn't seem big at first but with the Boudin sourdough bread, and then the inch high pastrami, not to mention the lettuce and red onions, you really have to squeeze the tops and bottoms down to take a bite. He had skinny steak fries which were super good. Stick straight, not soggy, stood well, and dipped well in ketchup (meaning doesn't fold under the weight of the sauce). For $1 more, you can get the sweet potato fries. Maybe next time.\n\nTwo sandwiches totaled a little over $19 after tax.

Hover near the curb so as not to loom over window table diners?  Not clear.  Once we were seated, things were pretty darn good.\n\nThey should install some ceiling fans - there's not a lot of air movement, and when it's warm outside, it's even warmer inside Toast.

A new concept for me! And one that speaks to the quality of the establishment indeed!\n\nFirst off, I have to say that Toast is adorable on the inside.  I feel silly saying this but it is always shiny! It has that old diner feel to it without it being dirty and outdated (like a lot of diner-esque restaurants are).  In fact it looks quite modern and fresh, and is impeccably clean (a huge plus in my book).  \n\nAlthough the food isn't anything I would deem out of this world, it has always been consistently good.  Anyone who offers Nutella on their menu as a side for pancakes and other delicious pastry style breakfast foods is a winner in my book.\n\nPersonal favorite is the mondo sized Breakfast Burrito - a fresh tortilla stuff to the max with eggs, cheese, tons of freshly sliced avocado, salsa, and sour cream.  If that's not enough to fill you up, the delectable dish is served with a hearty serving of crispy old style hash browns.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-03", "description": "I'm trying very hard not to judge Toast simply by comparison to its true diner predecessor, Herb's (aka \"Herb's Fine Foods\"), which I miss dearly, but I'm finding that next to impossible to avoid.  It's not just that Toast occupies the same physical space that Herb's did for how many decades, but it is also that Toast aspires to follow in the footsteps of the American diner tradition, but just can't pull it off.\n\nYes, Toast has ketchup and those little jam and jelly packets at each table, and it also has seating at the counter.  How oh-so-charming.  That must make it a diner, right?\n\nOne fundamental problem here is that whoever designed the 24th Street outlet of the Toast chain seems to have been convinced that certain \"upgrades,\" such as the flat-screen monitor tuned to CNN; those horrific decorative gleaming plastic toast replicas on the wall (yes, we know you're called \"Toast,\" we get it) that are evidently supposed to evoke a graffiti-esque edge; the intrusively loud background music; or the sorry little wine/beer/Italian soda shelf behind the counter, either have any intrinsic attractiveness or value to them, or somehow are true to the diner experience.  But in trying to somehow be both a diner and a \"millennial upgrade,\" Toast succeeds at neither; it has \"faux\" written all over it.\n\nThe second fundamental problem is that the food is somewhat tasteless.  We went there because, to their credit, they are one of the few places to be found in San Francisco that still serves hash browns (as opposed to home fries).  But the hash browns arrived in a perfectly flat and rectangular shape, as if straight out of microwave-ready packaging.  And the taste matched their appearance.  At Herb's, I remember seeing someone actually frying up the hash browns on a grill, and actually having them look and taste as if they had been made by a human at a grill.  Maybe the Jetsons like bland hash browns with perfectly formed straight edges; not me.\n\nFinally, the pricing is a little on the steep side for what you get.  A side of bacon, which turned out to be three strips thereof, was $3.95.  At Herb's, you could have gotten eggs, hash browns, toast, *and* bacon for about $6-7.  I paid about $11 for the same combination this morning.  Now that's progress.\n\nFor those of you who aspire to eat in the New Millenium, go to Savor - which I also like, but for different reasons and because it's not trying to be something it isn't.  For those who want to eat at a diner, I'd unfortunately recommend going someplace besides Toast.  Long live Herb's.", "author": "moosedog i."}

Ok, a little commercial, but a local business\n- Niman Ranch meats\n- Fair trade certified & organic coffees\n- Organic fruits and produce, when available\n- Compostable paper takeaway cartons \n\nGiven the above, one feels like Toast is making efforts to serve healthier food ingredients, until ...\n\nThe bad:\n\n- Smuckers brand jelly.  The second ingredient: high fructose corn syrup, the third ingredient: corn syrup.  Uh, where's the organic jelly?\n- Heinz ketchup.  Yup, same ingredients as in Smuckers\n- C&H sugar.  Ultra refinded and would probably satisfy the former Herb's crowd, but they also offer a more natural alternative, Sugar In The Raw brand turbinado sugar\n- Regular iodized table salt.  What, no Fleur de sel?\n\nOverall, Toast is a nice alternative to other Noe Valley breakfast restaurants and the late closing time of 10:00 pm is a welcome addition to our street of strollers and pups.  Typical breakfast fare, such as eggs benedict, scrambles, pancakes and corn beef hash are served, in addition to hamburgers, salads and sandwiches for lunch and dinner.  \n\nService was spotty on our visit, with delays in taking our order, refilling our water glasses and removing our dishes, but it certainly is a step above the former tenant - Herb's Fine Foods.  The building has been glamed up quite a bit with shiny metal trimmings on the exterior.  The only reminder of Herb's is the original Victorian mosaic tile at the front door and perhaps the counter service, though I miss the horseshoe counter of Herb's, it was pretty unique.  A tribute to Herb's, a hipster style hand drawing above the restroom door in the shape of a piece of toast, reminds diners of the former restaurant that occupied this space for so many years.  An additional 5 drawings line the wall with San Francisco cityscapes.\n\nUh, what's up with that distracting flat screen?", "author": "Rafael R."}

I could do without the stupid TV, but on my first visit today the service was good, and the \"Noe Valley\" (how apt) omelet consisting of bacon, avocado, cheddar (which I declined), and eggs, of course, was pretty good.\n\nI do miss the Eggs Blackstone that Herb's used to have, and of course the prices are about 50% higher, and there's slightly less food (hmm, almost starting to miss it now...)\nbut the new surroundings make up for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-17", "description": "I am a long time resident of Noe Valley, actually on 24th Street less than two blocks away from Toast. I would like to preface this review by saying that I have eaten here quite a few times. The only reason I periodically return is to see if they have improved their service and the quality of their food. It is my humble opinion that they have not made any improvements from the day they first opened, which is to say the food and service stinks. Why does this diner have make the patron ask for Splenda? Each table and counter place has other sugar substitutes and sugar packets, but you have to ask for Splenda. What a stupid policy. Now as for the food. If I could rate this place with a negative star, I would, but Yelp doesn't give me that option. I could probably write a short story regarding the lousy food, but I will try to contain myself. First let me say, what they call scrambled eggs would be better characterized as a fried egg patty, over cooked, and topped with food that sometimes is nearly unidentifiable. The hash brown patties must have been cooked on a device where temperatures must approach those of the sun's surface. Toast people, turn down your grill a bit. Anyone who orders French Toast, be prepared to have toast that is browned that has no taste, and the egg batter with which it is supposed to have some vanilla flavoring has no flavoring whatsoever. They could at least dust the \"French Toast\" with some confectioner's sugar. At least the taste buds could identify a flavor of sorts. I don't want to waste too much of your time or mine, but suffice it to say that the lunch fare is on par with the breakfast food, just not worth a visit. My view is not from just from one sitting. Since I live in the neighborhood toast is very convenient for me, hence my periodic visit with the hope the place improves. Since Toast is usually very busy on the weekends, I guess the proprietor(s) don't feel the need to improve its food and service. May I suggest they at least taste their tasteless food and perhaps make a change. One last thought, for the life of me, I can't understand the continued patronizing of this diner.  I have always thought San Franciscans had a far more discriminating palette. Even Herbs Fine Foods, which once occupied the place before Toast, wasn't all that great, was better than Toast.", "author": "Barry V."}

I ordered the French Toast Slam (which apparently has been renamed the Toast Combo) and my friend ordered the Ham and Cheese Omelet (which is now called the godfather).  Unfortunately the prices of the new menu are much higher and my French Toast Slam came with a choice of sausage or bacon - not both.  The eggs were even more watery than usual and I wasn't sure if the french toast was made with bread or if they had used recycled cardboard in an attempt at being green.  I marinated my pork sausages in syrup in an attempt to make them edible, but even then they remained too hard to cut through with the knife provided.  My friend's Ham and Cheese Omelet came with Italian sausage instead of ham, which would have been a nice upgrade if it didn't taste like burned bacon.  We each had a large orange juice but it seems that while they've increased the price to $3.50, they've downgraded from minute maid to the generic powdered substitute.\n\nAll in all I'm unimpressed with the changes to the familiar restaurant design and menu.

However, my other pal devoured her extended buffet of scrambled eggs, bacon, and belgian waffle with strawberries. The orange juice was good too, and the bottomless coffee was nice and hot, which is not always what you get in places like this.  Overall, my breakfast experience was a nice one, and it didn't hurt that we had a cute server.\n\n4.5 Star. Very Enjoyable.", "author": "Danny D."}

I tried it and it seemed they hadn't put even the most basic salt or pepper on it. We were craving ANYTHING that would give it flavor! \n\nI had the tofu scramble. There were no seasonings at all on it. Absolutely awful.\n\nAlso, the waitress was very unfriendly.\n\nI would never waste my money at this place again. Sigh.", "author": "ellyn h."}

There were no good movies playing and it was a nice day out--so i walked to Noe Valley, because I really wanted a waffle and a cup of coffee. I had only eaten there once before and i had posted a previous review. It was quiet, but there was no menu on the window--so i asked the server if I could look at the menu and she was very nice. I decided to stay and get my meal. They were very attentive to me. I placed my order and my coffee was brought right out--it tasted good and it perked me up. I relaxed and enjoyed it. Shortly afterward, they brought out my waffle and it was awesome--it was actually huge, hot, freshly made and covered with mounds of beautiful red strawberries dusted off with powdered sugar. The waffle had the perfect crispness when I cut into it and was absolutely delicious. Jessica was a wonderful waitress--gave me my coffee and wrote happy birthday on my receipt. Lydia and Irene was super nice and friendly. They are all genuinely into their job--they are all great.....and they made my day", "author": "alexandria s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-27", "description": "I kept hearing whispers and murmurs about this place with two locations in 'cool' parts of the city and was in Noe Valley doing errands yesterday around 3:00 pm and stumble upon it by accident.  Opportunity strikes in strange and unexpected ways, so I seized it and walked in and grabbed a menu and immediately liked the place.  It's small but clean, spare and inviting, and I loved the menu, it suggested good food, well prepared so I sat at the counter on a slightly too small stool (hey, I'm a huge guy) and ordered their basic burger with fries and a side of onion rings.  The menu told me they use Niman beef and the exposed stainless kitchen also told me they are meticulous in everything I could see so plainly and I felt confident I was getting fresh, well handled grub at this neat diner.  The spare space has about a dozen two top tables with nice upholstered chairs and there are maybe a dozen counter stools topped in bright red.  Color is gentle and spare and the artwork is various huge slices of toast with painted drawings by a local artist done in the style of the late Al Hirschfeld and they're wonderful.  Simple lighting, expansive, clean windows, a custom neon wall clock and well trained, pleasant servers working with clean, white uniformed kitchen staff served up my order which was perfectly cooked and served.  The burger was cooked just the way I wanted it, and the bun was toasted and the density was just right for the meat and fresh lettuce, tomato, red onion and sliced pickles.  Damn, the tomato's even had the tough, hard to chew center cut out, that's a sweet touch.  The fries are shoestring and house cut as well as blanched before frying which makes a near perfect fry, and the onion rings were addictive and delicious.  The portions are big and the prices are moderate, this place is a gem and I look forward to returning often.  They make shakes and serve Mitchell's Ice cream, a great local plus.  Beer and wine are available and they serve their whole menu from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM Monday's thru Saturday's and from 7:00 to 5:00 PM on Sunday's.

Upon walking up 24th street ,we noticed Toast and the crazy mob waiting outside to be seated. Glancing into the restaurant thru the all-glass facade our eyes immediately focused on the generous portions of fresh-looking salads and mouth watering plates of golden waffles and fresh fruits including blueberries,raspberries,etc.\n           The hostess told us it would be a 30-40 minute wait so we decided to put our name on the waiting list and grab a coffee at Starbucks. Twenty minutes later,my name was called and we were seated at the bar. The restaurant was impeccably clean and the service was prompt and more or less efficient. Ive had my fair share of corned-beef hash and I must say  Toast's hash is amazingly tender and well-seasoned.........delicious. My friend ordered the nutella pancakes and she was not dissapointed. The fresh fruit was  F-R-E-S-H and excellent quality.....fresh raspberries,blueberries and melon. Toast is a no-nonsense breakfast spot that uses fresh ingredients with a presentation of food that is not super sheeshy or over-priced. Very San Francisco nuts and bolts breakfast spot. I'll definetly go back.", "author": "peter n."}

They have a solid menu for breakfast, brunch, or lunch food. I would be less inclined to go there for dinner. Like the Church location, the service isn't the greatest, but it's not bad either. Given that there are so few lunch/brunch options in the 24th street corridor, it's great to have a new option, and I think Toast is going to attract a lot of business from Savor, whose service seems to decline to new lows every quarter. So far, I've only ordered the Niman Ranch Classic Burger and Fries, and find it to be good tasting and well prepared, and the fries have a nice light crispy feeling. One complaint - I find the menu to be extremely misleading. They make a big deal about serving Niman Ranch meat on the menu, and many of the items do use Niman Ranch meat, but many other items use standard industrial factory farmed meats. I think it's misleading to mix organic and factory meats on the same page. Bottom line: Nothing particularly outstanding about this place, but nothing bad either - a solid, clean, reasonably fast, and tasty option for basic American diner style food.", "author": "Eater S."}

So glad to have another brunch option on 24th- I'm hoping this will take the wait times down a little bit.  I've been here twice for brunch already.  The wait was not bad-  I found it easy to find the sign in list and was called sooner than expected . The staff is friendly and attentive.  I'm a fan of the scramblers-veggie had a lot more avocado than i expected-not a bad thing, but the real find for me is the fresh fruit- which is far superior to what chloe's calls its fresh fruit option.  It is in fact fresh fruit including seasonal berries that seemed like it could have been carried in from the farmer's market down a couple blocks.  I have also tasted the pancakes which i approve of -but not quite like chloes specials,  the hash browns were nothing special- i'm a sucker for the potatoes at savor.

I've ordered for pick-up three or four times and it's okay when I'm in a rush.  Their service needs some major work though.  First time they messed up my order and gave me the Chicken Club instead of Spicy Chicken sandwich.    My friend had a worse experience when they forgot to enter her order into the computer, so it wasn't ready when she got there.  They then tried to convince her that she had called the Church Street location...NEVER blame the customer!!!  When they found her order scrawled on a little pad next to the telephone, there was no apology or offer of a discount at all.  Not even an \"Oops, our bad!\"  Their side salad is absolutely terrible, and I'm not picky when it comes to salads.  But the lettuce was so limp and there weren't even hints of any veggies in it.  I hate wasting food, but I had to throw the salad in the compost.  The sandwich was good though.  Also, there's a waitress there who really needs to learn how to dress appropriately.  No way would I want to bring my kids in there when she's wearing hot shorts, stripper boots, and a seriously low cut shirt.  So for the service, 1/2 star, and 1 1/2 star for the food.
