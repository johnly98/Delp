It's a small space, so I can see there being a short wait during peak meal times over the weekend.\n\nFor a small restaurant, their menu is impressively large, with a wide variety of soups and salads, noodle soups, vermicelli bowls, different types of stir fried noodles, fried rice, and various protein dishes. They serve beer and wine as well.\n\nI was pretty hungry, so I ordered their seafood pan fried rice noodle ($10.95), which comes with shrimp, calamari, imitation crab, and fish cake. Portion size was good and everything delicious. I appreciated that they didn't skimp at all on the seafood in the dish.\n\nIt's a great spot for catching up.

It was a chilly night and Vietnamese food sounded tasty. \n\nDress: I was wearing leggings, a sweater, and black boots while my bf came in a Cal hoody and jeans. This place gave off a slightly more well dressed vibe with lots of middle age men and women dining together. \n\nAtmosphere // very red...red walls that give off a very red hue to the room. A bit dim. Tables are very close together, so you are intimate with also the parties sitting next to you. The booth seats seemed more spacious than the tables. \n\nFood // Started off well but it just didn't finish the race for me...\n-imperial rolls // 8.75 // absolutely delicious and perfectly crispy. Nice addition with the taro and it comes with a sweet sour sauce, which compliments it perfectly. Starting with this you can see why we were excited..\n-hot and sour fish soup // 10.55 for a large bowl (perfect for sharing) // honestly didn't like it. It's called hot and sour but actually it's SWEET and sour and wayyy too sweet. It's like they dumped all the pineapple juice/syrup into the soup. This one ruined my appetite cuz I felt nausea afterward... \n-shaken beef // 16.95 // tender and absolutely flavorless. This made me sad because the beef itself was tender, but there was no flavor....  \n-jasmine rice // 1.50 // gotta love rice with everything \n\nOverall // I only liked 1 out of the 3 dishes that we ordered. I give it a 4 stars because service was super nice and they kept refilling our waters (very attentive). Maybe their noodle soups are better.", "author": "Emily T."}

But instead of escaping the Nazis, I was searching for Five-Spice Chicken with Garlic Noodles, which clearly induced the same level of anxiety and hope for peace and Rodgers & Hammerstein music for all mankind...\n\nClimb ev'ry mountain,\nSearch high for pho,\nFollow every claypot,\nEvery slurp you know.\n\nClimb ev'ry mountain,\nFord ev'ry beef ball,\nFollow ev'ry spring roll,\n'Till you find your dream.\n\nNote that I didn't cast myself as the Captain since I wanted top billing. Regardless, I thought to myself that surely Sunflower would offer the same menu choices as Perilla and that my dream meal would not be a problem. But I didn't see it as a combo dish on the menu, so I asked the impatient server if I could switch the vermicelli choice with the garlic noodles. She gave me an emphatic no and told me I would need to pay for two separate main dishes in order to get what I wanted. I was upset much like when Maria found out the Captain was marrying the Baroness who hated the brats because they wore drapes from the Martha Stewart collection at the Salzburg K-Mart.\n\nWhat would Maria have done? Sing \"I Have Confidence\" and barrel her way into the kitchen to make it herself? Yeah, not me. I simply shrugged and ordered the $12.95 Five-Spices Roasted Chicken which came out flattened and a tad burnt and accompanied by sliced tomatoes and cucumbers, and a bit of the vinegar lime juice with chiles (photo: http://bit.ly/2o06gJI). It was alright and frankly could have been greatly enhanced by some garlic noodles, but I refused to pay the extra $8.95 for it. Instead I went for the bowl of jasmine rice for a $1.50. I guess nothing is complimentary here. Life is never easy for a postulant nun-turned-Nazi-hunted hausfrau.\n\nTo provide relief, I also ordered the $8.50 Shrimp Spring Rolls filled with vermicelli and accompanied by the thick peanut sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/2oG7hJV). This was good and certainly fresh-tasting though for the price, six pieces is usually standard and not just four. I was wondering if they were punishing me for being a solitary diner or just being high maintenance about the garlic noodles. We'll never know. As an added treat, I also got a $2.75 Thai Ice Tea (photo: http://bit.ly/2nGmgyK). No particular reason though I was wondering how far the road was between Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City. It had the requisite sweetness to blunt the pain of not getting the garlic noodles.\n\nSo long, farewell, auf wiedersehen, goodnight. Adieu, adieu to you and you and you...\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the five spices chicken was not five-star at all though the spring rolls were closer to the top of the class\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a darkened space not that well laid out\nSERVICE - 2 stars...there will be no garlic noodles...and let's cancel Christmas, too\nTOTAL - 3 stars...go elsewhere for Vietnamese food more kindly...and musically served", "author": "Ed U."}

Well? It was flat, severely flat. Didn't taste like it's been stewing or simmering in herbs, spices, or stock at all. It didn't have the hearty, fatty, comfort feel that a bowl of pho should have.

It was pretty close to amazing. Meat was super tasty, noodles were fresh, and the spring rolls were super tasty too. It just felt completely easy to eat. Felt more like eating a nice refreshing salad rather than a bowl of bun. My friend got their pho, and she seemed to like it plenty, so I guess you can't go wrong with wet or dry!\n\nPerfect lunch spot, especially if you work around the area like myself. Parking can be a bit of a challenge, but if you can get a spot, you can easily find yourself grabbing a nice little meal here at Sunflower!", "author": "Sean H."}

Dropping in with Alice L yesterday for lunch, we ordered [ Photo: http://instagram.com/p/amKWspwfvO/ ]:\n\n* Fried Tofu - Large slabs of tofu sandwiching a layer of lemongrass. Unless you really, really like lemongrass, I would suggest passing - and even then, I'm sure you can get your lemongrass fix some other way, because the tofu still comes off as rather bland.\n\n* Garlic Noodles w/ Chicken - Given the ridiculous serving size (it's enough to feed two or three), if you're ordering this as an entree for yourself, rather than a side dish, I'd highly recommend spending the extra few bucks for both the meat and veggies. Having just one or the other leaves you with just a bit too much noodle and not enough... stuff. And despite not being as garlicky as I've had elsewhere, this was still fairly tasty!\n\n* Beef Pho - I only had a small bite of this out of Alice's bowl, but, it was pretty good.\n\nAll in all, a solid 3.5 stars, and a place I can see myself coming to when I don't feel like making the trek to my faves.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - While the restaurant itself is accessible, bear in mind that this part of Potrero is ridiculously hilly, so be prepared to deal with those steep grades.\n\nBathroom - Didn't check them out, so no comment.", "author": "Johnny W."}

The decor is really nice and the red/orange walls make a very vibrant and lively environment. \n\nService: Like I mentioned service is quick, though maybe not the most attentive. Aside from taking our order and delivering food to the table, the waiters hardly had time to come back and check on us. \n\nFood: Really good! Both times I have gotten the vermicelli bowl (once w/ beef and once w/ the grilled shrimp). Vermicelli bowls tend to be bland, but the meat/seafood always has enough flavor. Wish that the fish sauce they give had a bit more flavor though. My friend got the garlic noodles w/ tiger prawns. They give 4 HUGE tiger prawns along with a lot of noodles (could easily be 2-3 meals). The noodles were packed with garlic flavor. The serving sizes are very generous.

This review is not because of bad food...we didn't even get food.... just terrible service.  \nThis  restaurant is close to my house.  My daughter, sister and I don't eat meat and every time we look for a vegetarian restaurant, this place shows up.  Finally last night we decided to try it.  \n\nWe were seated for a party of four.  The waiter who was a young male, likely in his 20s came over and asked us if we wanted to order something to drink.  I told him we would start with water all around.  For some reason,.. this infuriated him.   He viciously smashed his hand and down and took all of our drink menus (we all had one ).  Someone else  brought our waters.  The next time I saw our waiter, I asked him for drink menus. I explained to hime that we just ordered water when we sat down but didn't have a chance to see the menu.  He turned around to the table behind him, grabbed the drink menu and slammed it down on our table and walked away.\n\nWhen he finally arrived at our table for our order, I asked him to recommend something vegetarian.  He told me they had nothing.  I repeatedly asked him...just to clarify...if they had anything or could make anything vegetarian.  He just said NO NO NO.  \n\nI can get a veggie plate in a steak house.  Seriously?  a Vietnamese restaurant doesn't have anything vegetarian??\n\nAfter repeatedly asking...we had to leave.   All four of us got up and left.\n\nThis server should be fired.   Worst service ever.  DONT EAT HERE   OR SUPPORT RESTAURANTS THAT TREAT THEIR CUSTOMERS POORLY.

Unfortunately, NYC doesn't have a lot of great options for Vietnamese food, so I was exited when the friends I was staying with lived right down the street from this place.\nAfter we were seated and I saw that the food coming out to other tables looked very authentic, I was excited to get the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, and it did not disappoint! It was the best I have had in years! It erased all the memories of poor imitations of this beverage that I have had in NYC...\nThe food was equally delicious. We had spring rolls, imperial rolls, and entrees and everything was flavorful and fresh. The entrees are large and good for sharing around the table.\nThe staff was courteous and prompt with service, but they did not make us feel crowded. And the place was clean, well-lit, and had a nice breeze coming in through the open front door.\nMy only minor issue is I would have liked to see a little more descriptions of the dishes so you'd know what you are getting--I may have been slightly more adventurous if I had a general idea of ingredients in the menu items.", "author": "R F."}

But, we were able to snag seats by the window after another couple had left.\n\nAfter looking over the menu for a few minutes, I ordered the garlic noodles with chicken, which was $9.75 because it's $2 for chicken, beef, or shrimp and $1.50 to add mixed vegetables or tofu. The bf had lunch special #2, which was soup, an imperial roll, salad, and BBQ pork for $8.95.\n\nOur food came out in about 15 mins. The plate of garlic noodles was huge. At first, I was disappointed that I had just ordered a plate of garlic noodles with chicken, but after I tasted the garlic noodles, I was impressed. They tasted a little salty, but good nonetheless. The chicken was ok. Nothing outstanding. The garlic noodles were obviously the main focal point of the dish.\n\nThe bf let me have his veggie hot and sour soup and it was really good. I could've ate a whole bowl of it. I really enjoyed the pineapple chunks that added a distinct flavor and sweetness to the soup. He enjoyed the BBQ pork and salad. He also really liked the imperial roll. He said it was very flavorful and tasty. No complaints. \n\nWe had a great lunch experience here and plan on coming back for their dinner service. The bf thought that the lunch special was a good size. It isn't as big of a portion like others have mentioned because the bf said it was the placement of the soup in the middle that makes the lunch special appear huge. It was a decent size though.\n\nCustomer service was pleasant and parking wasn't that hard to find. We'd rather go to this location than the one in the Mission. The lunch prices are great. Our bill before tip was $20. So, I highly suggest coming here for lunch and I'm pretty sure dinner is good as well. But, just a little pricier.", "author": "Fallon P."}

I wish I could eat it every day.\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE: 3.5 stars\nIf you call two or more days in advance, they can usually fulfill your catering order. Sunny is very helpful in determining exactly how much of each item you need for large groups - 30, 35, 40, 45 - and making sure it fits into your budget.\n\nThe last time we tried to order from here, I called a day in advance and asked for the food to be ready at 1:15PM the next day... but because this pickup time was right in the middle of their lunch rush, they said they wouldn't be able to fulfill our order. At the last minute, we had to go with a different restaurant instead.\n\nI know it's demanding to place an order for a large group of people the day before or the day of, but sometimes this industry demands it... some restaurants can accommodate, no questions asked, but others (understandably) can't.

We, a party of 2, explained that i had an upcoming cold, and that I would hence need to sit away from the drafty windows. Needless to say, all the waiter had to offer was a table - well guess - by the drafty window. There were plenty of other tables available, one away from all windows.

But I do know when I find a place that I like and Sunflower is exactly that.\n\nWe walked in on the latish side, which I still feel bad about as they were about to close. I made it a point that if it was too late that we would be more than happy to come back again, but the staff was insistent that we take a seat.\n\nThe menu is vast and everything from the sea bass vermicelli dishes all sound absolutely out of this real kick butt. I wanted to order one of everything and then go back for seconds.\n\nSizzling seafood (which came out as advertised) and the garlic chicken are both solid choices. The spicy green beans were a nice find and one order is more than enough for two (three or even four).\n\nSunflower is small and if I lived in the neighborhood would certainly make this a regular pit stop.

Since it's rare to find Pho without meat stock, I was excited to try it out. Perusing the lunch menu, I ordered the #6 special instead since I was feeling kinda hungry. I ordered takeout since I didn't have all the time in the world for lunch. There was a little confusion on the phone about what comes with the #6. I inquired about whether it came with veg soup and veg imperial roll since the menu seems to indicate it's extra. She said \"yes yes\" in a curt manner. I later found out that my coworker who ordered the chicken, also got the veg soup and roll. \n\nUpon paying for the order the cashier handed me back my change but not the food. There were several bags of takeout nearby so I didn't want to just grab one. I stood there as she went to walk away. Then points and says \"your order\". Ok thank you. Would've appreciated handing it to me with maybe a smile. Oh well, customer service may not be their thing here. Thankfully cooking up some good food is.\n\nYou get a pretty good amount of food here for $10 after tax with the lunch special. The Hot and Sour soup was delicious! The perfect light but flavorful compliment to the excellent Imperial roll. It's like a large eggroll but so much better. I'm not sure how they get the texture of the roll but it's something you must try if you go here. It by itself is good enough to put up with the rude service. The lemongrass tofu was tasty but needed some sauce to liven it up. I may try the vermicelli next time.\n\nOn my second visit I got the Noodle soup. It's a huge bowl of veggies, broth, and noodles. If you get it to go, it will come in three separate containers that you combine. It definitely hit the spot on a cold 'n rainy day in The City. Same lady taking the order on the phone, same result.\n\nDo to its location and available parking, I'm sure I'll make this another semi-regular lunch stop. I just wish they had a few more veg items on the lunch menu. Also, maybe they could try out some customer service training.", "author": "John B."}

That's how I found this place as it was listed on the Big Eat 2014's list of 100 dishes to go try in SF.\n\nThe seating process is a little hectic as the waiters won't make a judgment of how to seat you and will have to wait until the manager. I can see how customers can perceive the staff as unfriendly as they are a bit brusque talking to people, but you just need to talk to them and you will see how friendly they are. My tablemates joked with the staff about cutting the fresh coconut open and the waitress chided to just use your hands to chop it open. Hahaha.\nThe waiter also joked about charging 5$ to close the door because of the draft. People should take it light with the staff here, they are super nice.\n\nThe good: five spice chicken with vermicelli and imperial rolls. The combo appetizer was really delicious though a little bit unwieldy to wrap ourselves with the rice paper they provide. (Everything in it was tasty though!)\n\nWe also got the clay pot special and the house special fried rice. I have to say most Asian restaurants that cook fried rice usually tend to over salt it as that's what most people are accustomed to, but the fried rice here was not salty but still flavorful - mad props for knowing how to cook proper fried rice.\n\nThis place does not look like a pho place and I would recommend getting the vermicelli anyway.\n\nWould definitely recommend this place for anyone who loves Vietnamese rice dishes!", "author": "Jeffrey Q."}

So I'm hopeful that they can manage to iron out some minor issues with food service, explained below.\n\nObviously since the place is new, it's nicer and cleaner than the location on Valencia street. They've kept the layout and decor from the previous tenant Baraka. So they also inherited the same design flaw, a one person bathroom (back right corner, next to private dining table). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunflower-potrero-hill-san-francisco?select=MtM9OVSb2d0BeihKN-WDXA#MtM9OVSb2d0BeihKN-WDXA Might be a long wait for the bathroom, when the restaurant is full. You've been warned.\n\nOverall the food is good (note that I prefer the Vietnamese places on Larkin street). \n\nThe one flaw that I saw with food service was the inability of the kitchen to keep up with orders with a half full restaurant. Also they couldn't deliver all the food for a table at the same time. I saw 4 or 5 tables were only one person had their plate, while their companion was still waiting for food. Apparently the kitchen was not checking the ticket orders, and just making whatever dishes were easier to make.\n\nIn my case, they took a long time to make my BBQ pork combination. While 2 tables that came after me got their food first (they had noodle soup bowls and crispy egg noodles). When I finally got my huge plate of food, I noticed that the pork was cold and only the soup was hot. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sunflower-potrero-hill-san-francisco?select=z_UCw1oxvvGyIYUVeerHsA#z_UCw1oxvvGyIYUVeerHsA\n\nMy guess is that the grill person did his/her part of cooking the pork, then the plate was misplaced. Later someone found it after most of the orders were gone, and got the soup person to complete the set. Therefore, I can only conclude that they have a very disorganized kitchen.

We weren't looking for something fancy but it shocks me that something so low quality can survive in that neighborhood.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

Our table was nice, close to the window but we were so close to the other tables that we could hear everyone's conversations.... It was also VERY loud inside the restaurant making it extremely difficult to hear anything my boyfriend was saying, and he was only a couple feet away! We ordered the pan fried noodles (combination) and the BBQ pork vermicelli bowl. \n\nMy pan fried noodles were decent. They lacked flavor so I needed to add chili sauce on top to punch it up but at least there were a variety of vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini, squash, mushrooms) and a good amount of chicken. The plate was also really huge so I ended up with a take away box after dinner because I couldn't finish it. My BF's BBQ pork was really good!! It had a lot of flavor so I kind of wish I had ordered something that included the pork... His meal also had the thin, white noodles on the bottom with some cucumber as well as one of the imperial rolls on top with a side of dipping sauce. \n\nService was a bit sketchy here.... There were only three servers for the entire restaurant so it was very difficult to flag someone down when I needed chili sauce or when we wanted the check. Overall the food we ordered was just okay, at least the dishes were better priced than some of the other nearby restaurants but I don't think I would return here for dinner. However I saw some pictures on Yelp that showed a pretty delicious looking lunch special!", "author": "Sam F."}

No?  Well, maybe that's just me, but that's exactly what I thought about when I took my first bite of my fried rice with prawns, chicken, and pineapple.  Well, maybe not the first bite.  It did need a bit more flavor, but once I got some of the sweet seafood sauce, that second bite sold me.\n\nSunflower is close to my cousin's house and one of his favorite places to eat, so when my husband and I came into town, it was the first restaurant he took us too.  The portions were enormous and the place itself was quaint and decorated simply, yet beautifully.  The small red room had a giant, black cast-iron candle chandelier in the center and there were candles in little cut-outs in the wall.\n\nBetween the group of us, we ordered the sea bass (which was very light and in great, flavorful sauce) and the garlic noodles and prawns.  Sunflower is known for its garlic noodles which everyone raves about.  Although popular, I am glad I didn't get it. When I tried it, it was too much for me.  Definitely for garlic-loves only.\n\nIt's a great little place in a great little part of Potrero with some of the BIGGEST meals I saw in San Francisco, especially for the price.  My advice?

There are two main reasons we consistently come back here:\n\n-Garllc noodles - This is the golden ticket; we have tried garlic noodles from a lot of vietnamese places around the Bay area (e.g. PPQ) and nothing compares. The garlic flavor is strong and infused (i.e. not tossed with garlic seasoning or chunks of garlic cloves). The noodles are firm without being hard, and soft without being limp.\n\n-Beef noodle soup - Essentially pho but they don't call it that. My friends and I have crawled through numerous pho places in the area. It's the consistency and strong flavor that drives our craving for this. Is it the best of the best? Maybe not but it's a solidly good dish that becomes a staple craving after awhile.\n\nThe staff is very nice and hustle around with efficiency. Also a huge plus is how clean the place is - something that for me plays an important part of the experience.\n\nI'd rave on but basically this is why I've gone to this restaurant more than any other restaurant in the city in my ~4 years of living here.", "author": "Raymond C."}

My wife writes all the cools stuff\n\n\nThe other week I went to Sunflower in Potrero Hill with some friends.  It was only my second time really having Vietnamese food.  The place was slammed on a Wednesday evening, and we had to wait about fifteen minutes to get a table.  A line of people continued to form waiting for tables to open.\n\nWe ordered some shrimp spring rolls to start.  They came with the traditional peanut dipping sauce.  The rolls themselves were standard, nothing outstanding about them, but they weren't terrible.\n\nFor my main I went with the Beef Noodle Soup, known as Pho.  A friend also decided on Vegetable Noodle Soup.  Basically, Pho is a beef broth based soup with rice noodles and meat.  Bean sprouts, chili, and basil are served on the side and you add them to the hot soup.  The beef is thinly shaved/sliced, so very tender.  I also added mixed vegetables to my Pho.  The bowl was humongous and probably had about a pound of noodles in it.  It was also full of vegetables and beef.  Definitely a great deal.  The flavor is amazing, slightly sweet with savory, brothy goodness.  It was a cold, windy night in San Francisco, so it was comforting and warming.\n\nMy other two friends each ordered Curry Chicken, which included mixed vegetables in a coconut curry sauce.  Their plates were enormous too.  It was definitely sharable.  It smelled delicious and had a nice subtle coconut flavor without being overwhelming.  It also smelled quite spicy, but the spice had great depth of flavor without being overpowering.\n\nI will definitely be going back to get more Pho, or try one of their other dishes.

Everything I tasted, including the Thai iced tea, was off flavor-wise. I didn't think it was possible to get bad Vietnamese food on the West Coast, but all of the items I ordered was actually really awful. Most likely this is due to the fact that all of the waitstaff and cooks are Cantonese (they all spoke this southern Chinese language to each other) and probably do not understand what Vietnamese food should taste like.

A very crispy rice crepe filled to bursting with bits of chicken, shrimp, and bean sprouts, and accompanied with mint, pickled carrots, cukes, lettuce to wrap everything up in and fish sauce to drizzle on top.  Messy and delicious!\n\n3)  Grizz loves GARLIC. \n\nSo I ordered another one of my favorite dishes, the Sunflower Prawns.  Four huge Tiger Prawns fried up and slathered in a tangy, sweet sauce and loaded up with chunks of garlic atop a bed of perfectly cooked noodles.  Perfect for garlic lovers like us! \n\n4)  Grizz loves SEA BASS.\n\nSunflower's version is generously sized and steamed with soy sauce, ginger, and green onions.

I was looking forward to prawn garlic noodle, but looks like that's no longer offered on the menu. \n\nInstead, we ordered:\n*Garlic Noodle with Shrimp $7.95 + $2 (3.5 of 5) - I thought I remembered it to be liked http://www.yelp.com/biz/thanh-long-san-francisco. I was wrong. This noodle is so much more chewier and bouncier. Reminds me of gummy texture.  Garlic is coarsely chopped and not as fine. And there are bits of scrambled egg stirred into the noodle. Completely different. Not bad, but not as great as I remembered it. \n*Shaken Beef $12.95 (3 of 5) - Tender beef cubes wok flashed in their special garlic chili sauce. Beef cubes were very juicy and perfectly cooked, but I couldn't figure out the sauce flavors and it wasn't that great. I would actually skip this dish next time. The sauce flavor is confusing and not that appealing to me.\n*Crispy Seabass about $26 (3.5 of 5) - Probably the most stunning dish. Huge piece of seabass that was first fried. Then re-plated on a sizzling platter and covered with a saucy caramelized mixture of ginger, sweetness, and garlic. Eventhough this dish was a bit pricey, it was worth ordering if you like seabass. The seabass was still crispy on the outside and so soft and flaky in the inside. Reminds me of a krispy kreme donut texture, but for seafood. The special sauce gives it this authentic asian flare. Be warned, the fillet is pretty big, so you can't eat it all by yourself. I recommend sharing with group of 3 of more.\n\nI was pretty disappointed the menu changed and the garlic noodles isn't what I imagined.

I was there with four other people and that allowed us to sample a great deal of food (five dishes in all).

There is even a selection of Lunch Specials for $8.95 that includes soup, imperial rolls, salad, and the main dish.\n\nI opted to try Vermicelli (Bun) #25: B.B.Q. Pork (Lemongrass marinade) with Imperial Rolls for $7.95. The bowl consisted of rice noodles, meat, ground peanuts, and various veggies like pickled carrots. Fish sauce was served on the side and there were two crispy imperial rolls (deep fried rice paper rolls with pork, taro root, and carrots) cut into 6 pieces total placed on top. \n\nThe portions here are big and my stomach was full when I reached the bottom of my bowl. Overall the dish wasn't super salty and tasted healthy. Everything was good, but nothing was over the top amazing. I wish the distribution of ingredients was slightly better.

Chicken spring Rolls were old and sticky, almost a gooey wrapper. Chicken inside was over cooked hard chunks of breast meat. Lacked any real flavor even when dipped in sauce. They seemed left overs from a day ago.  The beef dish although tender was cut so small it was a chore to eat. Very garlicky but had no taste of chili sauce as menu mentioned.\n Shrimp with vegetable should be listed Vegetables with shrimp. When the server was asked how many shrimp were in the dish, she had to go to kicthen and ask, she came back and replied \" 8 \" and then scowled as she finished taking order. The plate although large was a mess of totally raw vegetables that included cabbage, broccoli,cauliflower and onions. The curry sauce was so thin it clung to nothing and just sat there almost overflowing on to table top. This dish seemed to barely even be hit in a wok or sauteed, the 8 tiny shrimp were over cooked and rubbery and the vegetable and sauce sauce were barely warmed and as I mentioned the vegetables were raw, If the vegggies and sauce were cooked the proper length of time to get rid of raw flavor and texture and even a hint of a thickened sauce , I could see this being a decent dish. At no time were we asked how anything was and checked was dropped off without even a thank you or eye contact. 45 dollars plus tip , we were far from satisfied and even pondered  Boneless Chicken at KFC as dessert.", "author": "Craig S."}

Very large bowl.\n\nI think that for 2 people with a normal appetite, just the main course would suffice (a rice or noodle dish).

I make every effort to patronize all the restaurants encompassed around my zip code area.  I went for lunch yesterday, Sunday, 3/29 and ordered the appetizer combination which includes the Vietnamese spring rolls.  It also includes strips of pork, prawns, and raw or marinated veggies.  I have tried other menu items, but I am fed up pretending this restaurant of cooks and its owner(s) know, or willing to cook authentic Vietnamese food.  They take way too many inexpensive shortcuts which fools other customers who have no previous gastronomical or hands on cultural experience in Vietnamese cuisine.  I do, so I know the difference.  \n\nThis restaurant serves what should pass for fast food taste style version.  No culturally proud authentic traditional Vietnamese cook or chef would ever use canned pineapple as a menu ingredient.  Even the rice paper, used to encase bits of food, roll around like a cigar and dip into fish sauce, was so thin that it could not be removed from the plastic plate holding each one.  The food is boring including the broths. Obviously, this restaurant caters to customers with unsophisticated palates simply happy to brag that they had a menu with the word Vietnamese.  I took the diplomatic step to ask the waitress if the cooks were Chinese trained to cook Vietnamese.  She replied they were all Vietnamese.  However, the few times I have been there, I am pretty sure I recognize Chinese language being spoken by the wait staff and cooks.  I worked alongside of Vietnamese diplomats and several Vietnamese refugees at the time, when I was assigned to a Vietnamese embassy for almost four years, so II do know the difference there too. I am city born with Hispanic heritage but traveled and associated with an expansive range of cultural leaders and culinary professionals to know when food is fusion, traditional, or just diluted to appease those content with thinking they ate something culturally authentic.\n\nSunflower Restaurant must presume that nonVietnamese residents of this part of the city are too culturally naive to know the difference and they are probably accurate. I doubt this restaurant can fool anyone serving overseas before the communist took over all of Vietnam and the Vietnamese themselves or those of us with close links in various capacities with the Vietnamese community.   Many previous Vietnamese restaurants in other parts of town tried to appease the middle of the road Americanized  palate, but most of those don't last long in business. Fortunately, aside from a handful of us in Potrero Hill and surrounding neighborhoods, most remote from the 1970's introduction of Vietnamese culture and cuisine into the U.S. have a very sparse point of reference which Sunflower Restaurant hopes will be the common factor in serving unimpressive, boring rendition of Vietnamese food.

However, my poor experience tonight at Sunflower was really unfortunate and compelled me to write this review. It all comes down to the pho. Otherwise known as beef noodle soup on the menu. I was so disappointed. The beef was really overcooked and there wasn't a variety in beef cuts as there would be in more traditional restaurants. This place clearly caters to a more American palate AKA those unfamiliar with Vietnamese cooking. I guess the pho just isn't what you order here. My guest and I finished our soups, but we were still hungry because we were so unsatisfied with the meal. The broth was flavorful, but I would have liked it hotter. So we ordered some imperial rolls -- how can you go wrong with fried yumminess? Unfortunately, the pho had really melted away our appetites. We left dissatisfied and, sadly, have written Sunflower off our list. In addition, the service tonight was very rushed, brusque, and really added to the whole negative experience.

Other than that, this place is inferior to the Vietnamese cuisine in the TL.\n     The \"noodle soup\" (not pho) was ok. The broth had decent beef flavor and was not too salty or oily. However, the whole thing lacks soul. It feels like the cooks wanted to do a \"censored\" version of pho, so adventurous white people will try it without being scared away. There is NO brisket, NO beef balls, NO tendon, No tripe, and NO LOVE. The soup did not warm my heart.\n     The service was attentive, but the dude kept bumping into me while I was trying to eat. I only got one apology.\n     Overall, the ingredients and the flavors weren't bad but everything seemed fake. At least nothing was oversalted, unlike PF Changs.

We decided on Sunflower since my husband had a crazing for Vietnamese food.  Also, we had never eaten there before.  It turned out to be an excellent choice.  Service was very friendly, & accommodating.  The space is very attractive - Dark red walls, dark wood trim. We had a very nice seat at the window.  Great street scene, lots of people walking around.  It was a very warm night. Our waitress made excellent choices for us. We started off with the combo platter $11.95 - Excellent, selection of dishes. We also shared a plate of rice noodles topped with tofu & vegetables $7.95.  There was more than enough food for the two of us.  No room for dessert!

We arrived Sunday evening with 2 kids and 2 adults. We gave our names to the owner however he would not give us an estimated wait time and had the abrupt mannerism of 'too busy to be courteous', which didn't bother us at first, but when he passed us by to seat several successive patrons who came after us, we became rather annoyed. 3 groups behind us tried to tell him that we were in front of them, but he smiled and just waved his hand saying that my whole group was not present. In fact we where. One of the kids who was 4 was at most wandering around so dad was following him around the sidewalk. Me and my 8 year old daughter stood first inline at the door. We where all within reaching distance which other patrons pointed out too. It took the people behind us about 10 mins to be seated. It took us about 45 mins. The kids where very hungry by that point. Obviously we did something to offend him. I believe it was when I said we would be happy to take a 2 person table and the kids could sit on our laps since they were very hungry.

First of all, parking is way easier out here. Second, the interior is quite inviting with bright red walls (left over from the Baraka days). We ordered the beef noodle soup (pho) which was really nice and not too oily. Comes with individualnside dishes of fresh bean sprouts, chiles, mint leaves and lemon.

Sunflower did pass my 1st test. I ordered in Vietnamese and they understood (this is a good sign). ANY place that cannot understand when you order in Vietnamese, 9 outta 10 times it's going to be a bad experience. Sunflower, good job at the 1st impression. \n\nI've only had 3 of their lunch specials:\n\n#1 Soup, imperial roll, salad, Five Spice Chicken \n#2 Soup, imperial roll, salad, BBQ Pork \n#5 Soup, imperial roll, salad Lemongrass Prawns (spicy)\n\nThe first time, I saw the Lunch plate came out, I was quite amazed at how much food you get (no joke!). You get a lot of food for only $8.95.  I did opt to get brown rice for an additional $.50. \n\nThe Five Spice Chicken is good. It's moist and flavorful and not fatty. My only gripe would be, the chicken is not made to order. It's made ahead of time. We ordered food and it came out less than 5 mins later and the chicken was only warm.  The BBQ pork is also very tasty, you get a lot of meat ...also flavorful and not fatty.\n\nI would recommend both #1 & #2 again, if you need a good lunch spot that provides a lot of food for under $10. \n\nNow here's where Sunflower needs some improvements: of all the times I've been there, the Brown Rice & Reg. white rice has been dry. Only once has the rice been made perfect   (Come on, you're an Asian Restaurant....Perfect Rice should be automatic!)  Another gripe would be the Lemongrass Prawns Lunch Special. 1, 2...3...wait a minute...there's only 4 Prawns and the rest were all Veggies! This item is a great disappointment.  Add more Prawns, then it would be good. \n\nThe Imperial rolls that come with it is good and the Sour Soup that comes with it is amazing. \n\nI'd definitely come back for lunch (since I work only a few blocks away) and so should you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-29", "description": "Restaurant is billed as Vietnamese - it may be more accurate to say Chinese - Vietnamese fusion with a touch of California - the staff is Chinese and the food is served the way Californians like it - with a bit of flair and color, and thankfully not overcooked. This is a restaurant where the owners and manager seem to have a lot figured out. The food is fresh with an aesthetic presentation. Service is fast and usually friendly with some crankiness at times but even then the sense is they're just out to do the work as effectively as they can. Menu is highly formulated but nicely varied. Prices are exceptionally reasonable. After three prior restaurants in about a dozen years failed at that location, looks like they're here to stay, and that's great for the neighborhood. \n\nWould be nice if they made a point of serving organic food, or at least starting to do so. This is a tough one for restaurants - organic food costs much more at the wholesale level. Even if all restaurants banded together to ensure organic food, people might decide that eating out is just too expensive overall. On the other hand, they might be able to pull together to reduce prices in quantity buys of produce. However, it could work for each individual restaurant to start somewhere and increase organic offerings slowly and incrementally. \n\nThe tofu, for example, could be organic; the price point on that might not be as large as in other food items, and that might be a good place to start. If the staff understands that GMO soybeans that go into making tofu means that pesticides are added into the crop as it's grown and that this has not been tested on humans, i'm sure they could pass along that info to their guests. \n\nOrganic tea could come next, then organic rice, and over time organic produce could come later. Phasing it in this way, prices might go up a little but not shockingly, and the commitment to organic + local would demonstrate awareness that a neighborhood like Potrero Hill would likely appreciate and embrace. Clientele is already quite loyal so it might be tempting for the owners to not even try this, but it's way, way, way time for restaurants to help support healthier lifestyles and organic / local food items, especially in a neighborhood as aware, and with as many fresh food gardens, as Potrero Hill.", "author": "David G."}

I'll get back to this little detail. \n\nThe ambience is amazing and the atmosphere was romantic. I really liked the copper tables and the patina that developed on them. It seems like a well thought out trendy Vietnamese restaurant. This place was packed so it seemed like a good place to eat. This is where the positive comments end.\n\n We ordered grilled pork vermicelli and the \"famous\" garlic noodles.  The waitresses were rude, which is typical of Vietnamese restaurants, but I was expecting better since this was a trendy cool-looking place. The garlic noodles were not bad tasting, but they were definitely not garlic noodles. It tasted more like pad-see-ewe spaghetti. The chicken in it was overcooked and bland. It was a large portion, so I don't have an issue with that. it was $10, which is overpriced compared to comparable dishes.  $8 garlic noodles from Perilla in Inner sunset actually tastes like garlic noodles.  The  Grilled pork vermicelli was bad. The noodle were dry and choppy, with no long strands. Even Asian noodles should be al dente. These were dry and undercooked. Maybe they were just low quality noodles. The grilled pork was not bad. The imperial rolls, which are just egg rolls, were not good. They used spring roll wrappers instead of egg roll wrappers. I don't know if this is a cost saving measure or their preference, but that is not how a real egg roll should be. Not one water refill the whole time.\n\nThis last bit is what pissed me off enough to write a review.

I opened it up and saw that they were 3/4 full. Where the f*** was the rest of our food? Remember I said that the portions were pretty big. What the f***??? I know how much of our food was left when they took the plate and they returned with not even half of it. This was shady to me, so I ask some other friends about this place. A rumor is that they take some of the garlic noodles, which is a common dish and put it back into the community pot because it's easy to mix it in with other orders. A shady cost saving measure.  If it wasn't so obvious and blatant, I wouldn't mention it, but it seemed like they were more attentive and friendly towards white people. Asian people sometimes do this and it pisses me off. Everyone should be treated with the best customer service, or if you're going to treat people badly, at least do it to everyone. Equality should be the standard, if not good customer service.\n\nSo back to my first sentence... The friend that recommended me is a white guy. I looked around the restaurant and saw only white people. No other Asians. I'm not saying that white people don't know Asian food, but Im saying Asian people only eat good Asian food. \n\nSumming it up... Great decor and ambience. Mediocre food. Bad customer service. Food disappeared upon taking out. \n\nGood food and good customer service being the most important things to me, I strongly recommend you find another vietnamese restaurant to enjoy in SF.", "author": "Thomas L."}

Lines form nightly now and it's unclear how long it will take to settle down.  I can forgive the service kinks but the food needs some work.  Garlic noodles were oily and bland except for a harsh, rather than sweet (naturally sweet) garlic flavor.  The saltiness of the shaken beef nearly killed me, had me chugging water for the rest of the night - and I have the post mortem puffy eyes to prove it.  \n\nThe waitstaff are mixed and various people will take your order, bring your order, chat you up.  There is sharp-tongued host who comes by from time to time ~ she was a crack up.  But our waitress for the rest of the time didn't speak any english, which was a bit frustrating when I tried to ask for a hot sauce.  Things got worse when the dish we ordered was brought over to the table next to us instead. Our neighbors protested they ordered their garlic noodles with tofu not veges, but she insisted it came to the right table, even though we tried to tell her it was probably ours.  They decided to switch up and dug in just before she rushed to whisk the plate back to the kitchen.  But 10 seconds later she reappeared with the dish to our table.  \n\nNow, would you have said something?  Cause riddle me this.  You complain that the dish was the same one that the woman next to you served herself out of, but how do you know?  And how do you insist on getting a new one and know that a) you will get a new one or b) that your insistence won't just spark the ire in your server, who looks too tired to give a poop what you're eating anyway.  \n\nI hope the success of this place attracts other entrepreneurial spirits too.

I had the chicken pho ($7.50) for my entree and split imperial rolls (don't remember the price) for the appetizer. It was all really good. I'm really full. The quantity was on par with a large from Pho Hoa, but this tasted way way more fresh. I was not disappointed with any of the food. The pho was also a little spicier than what I've had at other places. So note to self next time, try the pho before adding rooster sauce.

We went about 7:30 on a Friday, they don't take reservations, so we had to wait a while to get in. It is a tiny restaurant and since we had a group of 4 we had to wait outside. It was about 15 minutes before we got in. They took us to a back booth behind a curtain with throw pillows and fluffy felt covered cushions. They said they got us in there because someone had cancelled their reservation (even though they don't take reservations...). But I didn't complain because we were able to get in and had a great booth away from everyone else. \nThe food portions are huge and we ordered WAY too much food. What we ordered for the 4 of us could have fed 8... \nHere is what we got: the imperial rolls, the calamari salad, the crab meat and sweet corn soup, bbq pork and imperial rolls vermicelli, prawn noodles, garlic beef and spicy green beans with a few sides of rice. The food was delicious. \nThe service got a little slow at the end and it took a while to finally pay. Oh, and the prices are CHEAP!!! I can't believe how inexpensive for really good food.

Long story short, I was late picking up my sister at the airport because of my issues (we're all friends here, right?  So I can admit this).

I never quite make it out to this area, but would definitely come again for Sunflower.\n\nI ate here for the first time a couple days ago with my coworkers. We were there to celebrate with our coworker who is leaving on maternity leave soon. We had a large party so when we got there, we had to push some tables together. Our very pregnant coworker attempted to help us, when the waiters/waitresses made her sit down and rest. In fact, I think they gave us special treatment after that. No water with umbrellas in it like we had asked for (j/k!) but they went all out with different orders of water, hot water, and water with lime. Definitely a plus that the staff was so attentive. \n\nI ordered the garlic noodles which I was really looking forward to. The last time I had garlic noodles was at Perilla located in SOMA, so I was expecting a very similar, hearty and buttery dish. The noodles were not quite as garlic-y as I expected. Nor was it as buttery and heart-clogging. But maybe that's what it needed?! Anyways, the dish it self was pretty good - chicken was a bit dry; the beef combo looked way better. The next time I come back, I am definitely trying one of their curry dishes instead. My coworker across from me ordered the dish, and I could just smell the curry as it was coming out! It looked (and smelled) delicious! And did I mention the portions are huge?", "author": "Lina W."}

The tables along the walls were a little too close together, impeding entrance and exit, and you kinda had to share (eavesdrop on) conversation with people at the next table, making it less intimate an experience, but hey I was not on a date, so it was okay.\n\nThe place was pretty quaint with red walls, definitely a step up from many of the utilitarian Vietnamese restaurants I usually go to.  My friend and I did family style and shared:\n\nSunflower Crepe\nGarlic noodles with vegetables\nShaken beef\n\nOur favorite was the Crepe.  It comes as lightly golden crispy \"crepe\" which is thicker and fluffier than the French Crepe, stuffed with fresh bean sprouts, chicken and seafood (pieces of plump sweet shrimp).  Accompanying it is a plate of lettuce, mint leaves, pickled julienned carrots and slices of cucumbers, and the sweet/sour sauce.  We wrapped hunks of the crepe in lettuce, topped with the pickled vegis and the sauce, and ate it with our hands.  The contrast between crispy hot crepe and the cool vegis was so unexpectedly delicious!  It was a little messy but well worth it.\n\nThe garlic noodles and the shaken beef were also good, but we decided next time to try the noodles with one of the other options; tofu, chicken, beef, or shrimp (2 pieces).  The vegetables that were added to the noodles at our request were a little too big and crunchy and were difficult to eat.  The shaken beef was tender.\n\nAll in all a great experience and my friend has added this place to her list of take-out places.  Oh yes, they do take outs and I suspect that this is a popular option for people who live the neighborhood, because the counter was PACKED with take out bags at dinner time.

In the 2 blocks of space that contains both a Chez Maman and a Chez Papa, you really can't go wrong with any of the picks here. Last week, another jewel was added to the mix: Sunflower!\n\nThe sister restaurant of Sunflower Authentic Vietnamese in the Mission, this new location provides a more hip and more spacious atmosphere that features the same great food and service. Between the four of us, we had:\n\nImperial Rolls\nShaken Beef\nLemongrass Chicken\nGarlic Noodles with Beef\nVermicelli with Marinated Pork/Spring Rolls\n\nThe portions are enough to provide the next day's lunch. I barely made a dent in my vermicelli before I felt uncomfortably full, and pretty much everyone had a to-go box with them at the end. The marinated pork was charbroiled just right (not dry/burnt like some places I've been to). The fish sauce had a little spicy kick to it too, which i really liked. If you're not a vermicelli person like I am, I would recommend all of the other dishes we ordered. Everything was extremely flavorful. The shaken beef was SO tender! I also like the crunch that the green beans gave the lemongrass chicken dish. As for the garlic noodles, you really can't go wrong with that. I wish they had a crab option, but there has been hints that they might do a seasonal crab special in the future. Yum! \n\nThe prices are good and the parking is super easy. \n\nThis is a flower I'll be putting in my bouquet of frequently visited eateries.", "author": "Rona J."}

The worst thing about this place is the use of MSG. This is the third time I got a headache after having a lunch at that place. I did ask them whether they use MSG, and they always say that they don't add any MSG, but do use sauces and ingredients with MSG. Funny logic! If they add ingredients and sauces that contain MSG, how can they claim they dont't use any MSG. Also, imitation crab in seafood dishes is pretty disgusting. Potrero Hill needs a good Asian restaurant. Elisa's, please come back!\nBottom line, no more lunches for me at Sunflower until they stop using MSG laden ingredients.", "author": "Prem M."}

I can certainly get cheaper, better tasting Viet food down in San Jose but that's like 50 miles away!  It's clean, the ambiance is great and cute (yes, cute).

Claypot dishes usually hold the tastes in very well for the meats.  The beef with garlic dish is a good complement to the fish as it has more of lighter sauce with a medley of yummy veggies (red bell peppers, onions, green broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini).\n\nThe viet coffee isn't nearly as strong as some other ones, but it's worth a try if you haven't had any before.

Which, was no more than 2 months ago. That says A LOT. \nMy first dish ordered from here was the garlic noodles. WHOA!! They were to die for. If it wasn't because I wanted to try more dishes, I'd order this dish: EVERYTIME!! the noodles are cooked just right, they taste like noodles smothered in garlic, and not with a million other spices. They're very simple, but done so well. They're garnished with cilantro and cucumbers, which adds that freshness. But they're not crazy greasy and the chicken is tender, tastes like it was just made, and made specifically for this dish, and not just thrown over these noodles.   And they have this garlic hot sauce, it's spicy, but not too spicy, and addicting! \nThe next dish I tried was the beef vermicelli bun bowl. I love it! It's light, tasty, the rolls are always cooked perfectly and the beef is tender, and seasoned to perfection. A nice dish ESP if you're trying to stay on the light side. Lol\nThe house fried rice! Ok, it has pineapple, and I love that. So I was sold. BUT, it was kind of bland. I'm not sure if it was just because I was expecting more, but it was alright. But I love that the meat in the dish is chopped up. I thought that was really cool, you don't have to stuff your mouth with a whole shrimp! Lol\nPHO!!! PHO-king Uh---mazing!!! The broth is perfect, not too much noodles, thinly sliced meat, that does cook w/the heat of the broth. And omg, I can't wait for it to get colder so I can go more often!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-11-15", "description": "I wrote this place off the first time I went- Garlic Noodles waaaay to garlicky. My mistake? Maybe, but why would you offer noodles on your menu with no vegetables or anything on it? You have to ask and pay extra for the vegetables apparently.  This is not common in a Vietnamese restaurant. Usually dishes on the menu are balanced and well-considered.  Also, I'm sick of SF restaurants charging so much for so little. I know SF restaurant goers feel like this place is reasonable. It can be, but when you know you can get the same quantity at better quality for $3-5 less in other cities, it starts to really get under your skin.\n\nNext visit was out of desperation. I was really sick and could barely walk to get the pick up, but had to eat and everyone knows Pho is good for the sick....I walk up a little delirious and wait at the closer end of the bar/counter. The owner notices my condition and even makes a comment.  It was a bit rude, but the worst part was when I tell her I'm paying by card. I make a gesture to hand her my card and she says, \"give it to me here.\" As in, she made me walk it to her even though I look like I need to go to the emergency room. By the way, she wasn't in the middle of anything.  BTW- the Pho ga was just okay. How disappointing.\n\nBelieve it or not, this review is actually about my third and latest attempt at Sunflower. I live nearby so it is inevitable that this restaurant sneak back into the rounds. I also wanted to get something that I was impressed with, considering how many people like this place (service aside).  In an attempt to give the place a try (my boyfriend thinks the place is fine), I read the reviews and find one to be quite helpful. Karen N. suggests the vermicelli which is apparently hard to screw up in vietnamese restaurants. Great! I order this with the bbq pork and it comes with imperial roll. I have to say, I think I found my go to dish.  I know I spent a lot of time slamming this place, but I'm happy I found something!  So even though they don't offer the thai tea with coconut milk which is the traditional way to make it, and a nice non-dairy option, I am pleased with my meal even if a bit annoyed.  Lunch price is reasonable- $7.50 for good portion! All in $8.21.  I'm happy about this value in particular.\n\nUnfortunately, Sunflower found a way to screw it up. Guy hands me itemized bill- $8.21. I hand him my card. When I get the credit card bill back it says $9.31.  He entered in a greater amount on the CC machine!  Long story short, DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  If you do, make sure you look at your receipt. They just want to take your money. That may be the case in most places, but at least act like you care about serving good food and you care about return customers. That is all.", "author": "Faith R."}

Many tables were available. The waitress refused to seat our friends because my husband and I weren't there yet. They called us and we were a few blocks away. Didn't make any difference. I'd understand if it was busy and there weren't many tables open. This happened before, except we were waiting for a friend to show up. That time, my husband and I were shoved aside to the bar while waiting for one more friend to join us, and we were ignored for the most part while waiting. We tolerated that time because they were very busy. And I thought since I'm kind of a regular, they would make an exception. No such luck for this regular. So enough is enough. I can put up with mediocre food, but poor customer service is unacceptable. I told the waitress they lost our business for good because this is not how customers want to be treated.

I began to crave pho but I didn''t  feel like driving to the TL to get it. I also wanted to try and get non-MSG pho. I wasn't sure such a concept existed or whether it was an oxymoron. The closest thing I found was a vietnamese restaurant in Potrero Hill called Sunflower. The restaurant is characteristically Potrero Hill. It was quaint and filled with local residents. I ordered a bowl of beef noodies while my bf ordered the much talked about garlic noodles. I can't say it was the best pho I have had but it certainly did the trick.  I didn't feel the usual effects of MSG so I assume that there was little to none in the soup. The garlic noodles where quite tasty but nothing particularly special.

I just started to get into Vietnamese food so I can't critique the food too much. I had the standard vermicelli w/ bbq beef. I thought it was good and of great portion (dinner + breakfast). Still can't tell the difference too much between the vermicelli, it seems like a dish you can't really f*ck up. Anyway, I like this place cuz I just moved to Pot Hill and it is inexpensive comparatively. I will definitely be going back, but.... I don't think its a place to get reservations for on a Friday night", "author": "Stan W."}

When we came in, we wanted the private table for 6 in the back, partly cuz one of us was on crutches. The hostess was initially very rude, but turned out to be super cool. She was joking with us throughout dinner and we chatted for a while after eating.\n\nThe food was fantastic and the ambience was very nice.\n\nSpicy lemongrass chicken was a definite favorite. Spicy green beans were a close second. The \"small\" soups are pretty big and definitely shareable. Curry prawns were great as well.", "author": "Nithin R."}

Its listed as beef noodle soup, but its your basic pho.  The broth isn't quite what I prefer, kinda short on flavor compared to others I've enjoyed.  No tripe or tendon though, which is a shame.  It feels a little too simple a version of a dish that is capable of so much rich dimension.

It is refreshing to be greeted by such a friendly staff, a welcome change from their neighbors across the way (Aperto) who scowl at you if you dare to bring your own (superior) cup of coffee to their brunch service. In such hard economic times it would be wise for restaurants to follow the model of the Sunflower staff's sunny disposition. Such friendliness makes eating out well worth the splurge, while few of us have any reason to frequent a business full of haughty waiters.", "author": "Ruth M."}

We frequently order out from here, but it actually has a nice interior (the space formerly housed the tapas place Baraka). My \"must order\" items are the garlic noodles and the imperial rolls. I also love the vermicelli noodle bowls, the clay pots, and the shaken beef dishes - and the brown rice option is a big plus! Portions are hearty and quality of food is definitely up there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-13", "description": "We live in the area, saw the reviews thought we would give it a try... big mistake. The service was inattentive--no one was watching the line at the door or the open tables. Once we were seated the waiter did not greet us, rather she simple barked \"What you want to drink?\"  The menu looked promising but when the appetizers (crepe and pot stickers) arrived the pot stickers were lumps of something that looked like they came frozen from 7Eleven and tarted up with Rice Krispies, the crepes were not better, being so greasy they stuck to our teeth and left a pool of oil on the plate. Both were left unfinished. The entrees, beef noodles and combo pan fried noodles, were no better--very bland and very greasy lacking any flavor save for the generous portion of MSG in both. The pan friend noodles had been cooked well in advance and had solidified into a single glutinous mass requiring a knife to cut them into slices. The random ingredients meant to add flavor to the dish looked like someone was cleaning out the fridge rather than following a traditional Vietnamese recipe. The beef noodles while generous in portion size appeared to have been made with canned stock and lacked any flavor--or actual real beef. The waiter forgot to bring the basil, bean sprouts and chili for the beef noodles but given they were only offering three wilted basil leaves with the spouts I can see how he overlooked them. When we asked about the chili, we were told that was for carry out orders only. We had to ask a second waiter to get the chili--which regrettably did not manage to make the meal edible. As with the appetizers, both entrees where left unfinished. While the physical space is acceptable, the quality of the service and the food are not. By far the worst meal we have had in San Francisco.", "author": "Colin C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-27", "description": "For some reason last week, I kept getting cravings for pho.  Last Friday I happened to be dropping off a coworker in Portrero when he mentioned a place close by that served pho.  Imagine my surprise!  I found this restaurant right across from goat hill pizza and it was completely packed!  The husband and I got the last table and were excited to see that pho was indeed on the menu.  Unfortunately, it seemed like one of those Asian places that wasn't too authentic.  We were practically the only Asians there.  There was only one beef noodle soup on the menu (wah?) and they didn't even have the red spicy and hoisin vietnamese sauces.  We also ordered a combo crispy egg noodle which I had thought was more of an HK dish.  The food was pretty good actually and was semi-authentic but I when I go for pho, I tend to go for the places that focus on the food more and not the ambiance so much.  The service was eh.  After we ordered the food, they took away our plates and utensils without a word because I guess we didn't order appetizers and then we had to flag them down for every little thing, including getting those plates back.  Also, we were kind of rushed through the process I'm guessing because they wanted to seat more people.  I would say this is a dependable neighborhood eatery with decent pho but I wouldn't travel far just to try it out.", "author": "Susan L."}

The most important thing about Sunflower for me is its convenience of being in my neighborhood.  The restaurant itself is clean and designed nicely.  They have a very comprehensive menu with a pick for every taste from yummy rolls to various noodle soups to main course dishes like 5 spice chicken (one of my favorites).  When I got there today, the place was packed and people were waiting outside for a table.  Once I finally got to sit down, I ordered the noodle soup with beef which is one of the main Vietnamese dishes (Pho). Although you can argue that the food may not be as traditional as places in Berkeley or San Jose, you can still have a tasty experience right here in San Francisco without having to drive so far! The staff is friendly and the food gets to your table fast and hot.  Overall I had a great experience but the only thing that I would caution you about is when the restaurant is full, they don't manage the wait list too well:  When I got there today, there was no written wait-list and they told me that it would take 30 minutes for a table to become available when in reality I got to sit down in 10.  Most people who are on a tight lunch schedule would have walked away when in reality the wait was manageable!", "author": "Alex S."}
