I've hosted a going away party and attended two birthday celebrations at Sugar Lounge! All of the bartenders are extremely friendly, and I love talking to the wonderful owner and her charming daughter (extra points for a family business). Their specialty cocktails are all fun, flirty and creative. My favorites are the Pink Pussycat (clementine, mango champagne, honey, etc.) and the Apple Mojito. \n\nSugar Lounge is by far the best place for happy hour in Hayes Valley. They offer a different $5 cocktail Monday-Friday that range from a peach cosmo to a strawberry margarita. If you come on Friday, make sure to come hungry!  During peak happy hour time they offer free finger food such as sushi rolls, paninis, and quesadillas.\n\nKeep up the good work, Sugar!", "author": "Bryan D."}

I was drinking an Old Fashion that was perfect. It came in an old school bourbon glass that looked like he got it from my Grandma's cabinet but I loved it!! Three drinks for $24 (they weren't on the Happy hour menu) and it's not well. Can't find that too many places in ATL.\n\nThey were playing r&b and after drink two I was having a mini concert on my stool.

My roommates and I put our names down at the ramen shop down the street. Since the wait was supposedly 1.5 hours, we went for drinks. All my favorite places in Hayes Valley were insanely packed, so we ended up at Sugar Lounge.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor here is very... Eclectic. There's so much going on, like a cross between a sports bar and a nightclub. It's like no one could decide on the theme of this place. There's seating at the bar and high tables along the side, as well as couches in the back towards the restrooms. We were lucky to grab a comfy couch.\n\nThere's an extensive cocktail menu, all of which sounded quite tasty. I decided on the Pepper Khan cocktail, which was spicy af. At first it tasted like straight alcohol because it wasn't well-mixed. Oh and the bartender was sniffly and sick that day, which was a concerning.\n\nSugar Lounge seems like more of a neighborhood bar for regulars, not one that attracts hipster millennials flocking to the latest craze. I wasn't a fan and would only come here again in similar circumstances... If my favorite Hayes Valley bars were too crowded. At any rate, I appreciated the experience!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

This is a big perk and service to the area. \n\nThe place is long and but not so wide.  We sat at one of the high-top tables which parallels the opposing wall to the bar.  The table had a huge wobble.  One in our party ordered a martini-style drink in an \"up\" glass.  The drink spilled no less than 3x from the wobbling.  In the end, we just held our drinks in the air. \n\nAs we were starting on our second drink, an older lady who works there came over and announced, \"Private Party\".  We were unclear at first what this meant.  So we picked up our drinks and went to the back of the bar, assuming that the tables were sitting at were being taken over by a private party.  Having settled in at a different table, we noticed the place clearing out.  After some discussion we decided that the lady meant the WHOLE bar was being cleared out for a private party.  This was confirmed when she came over to tell us (politely) that we can finish our drinks.  Probably a better approach to the whole situation would have been to tell us when we ORDERED the drinks that we would be kicked out soon.\n\nOn the bright side, the bartop is an underlit marble that is quite nice.

All of the ones have always been good to my taste buds but not to my liver. Lol the drinks here are good and can be a creeper. \n\nWe went this past Friday for happy hour and had such a good time. It looks like they had remodeled the place a lil bit by adding tables that have a glowing marble top. This definitely adds a fun accenting light to the place without making it look too dark. They do provide little munchies to snack on - grilled cheese with jalape\u00f1o peppers, egg rolls, guacamole with chips and tempura. The drink I stuck with for the night was the American mule. It was deceivingly light in alcohol flavor, but boy did I get a great buzz after 2. The ginger beer hit the spot every time in the American mule. My husband got the mandarin mule, it was sweeter than we like but definitely a good choice for people that want their drinks that sweet. We ordered a Jameson on the rocks and it literally looked like a full size cocktail, woah. \n\nAt one point we ordered drinks and not sure how the order was wrong but the Owner Mehe(?) came over afterwards and gave us a drink on the house! How nice is that? She was really sweet and even came by every now and then to make sure we had a good time.\n\nWe'll definitely be back to enjoy more happy hours here. One tip I would say is get there around 5pm before it gets crowded and you can't get a table.", "author": "Yvonne T."}

Before the show we decided to hit up some local libation spots, and stumbled upon the Sugar Lounge.  \n\nI got carded and my wife and 2 friends did not, which was a great starting perk. We went in and the place was full, a nice pinkish hue dimly spilled throughout the space. I make my way through the music and crowd to the bar. A lovely latina bar tender greets me and I charm her into smiling with a smile of my own. I ordered a few specials off their board for the ladies, and a couple beers and shots of Jamie. We get lucky and score the tables in the back intimate room and revel in the gold glow from the table, pictures to commemorate.  \n\nI get up to score another round of drinks, but this time on the other side of the bar. My friend and I stand there near the bar tender, not the gal this time but a short white dude, he doesn't even bat an eye, he must be busy. Cleaning glasses? another couple stands next to us and we all stare at him. You would think in a packed house of eager drinkers would be the time to make money for the bar and himself? He instead turns the other direction and leaves the bar area, WTF. I then say let's get out of here. As I pass the idiot bartender I make sure to bump into him really good. So, whoever owns this bar, invest in upbeat bartenders who like to work in that type of atmosphere and keep the spirits flowing. The next bar we went to was much different by large.

Absinthe was pretty busy and we were hoping to find a place to sit so we went across the street to Sugar Lounge to grab a drink.  They're normally much busier and we were a little surprised at how quiet it was there, but there were seats open so we dove in for a fancy cocktail.\n\nI decided to try the Bees Knees and bought my friend a Pineapple Express.  Both $10 drinks, the Bees Knees consisted of Jameson, Wild Turkey American Honey, Frangelico, and a honey drizzle.  I can't quite remember what was in the Pineapple Express except that it was sort of like a pi\u00f1a colada but used gin instead of rum.  The Bees Knees was really damn strong but was lightened up by the honey drizzle and I quite enjoyed it at the time.  However, I did end up with a huge headache the next morning which didn't help much.\n\nWhile the place might have been quiet on a Wednesday night, I can see why the Sugar Lounge is normally packed.  The drinks were tasty and reasonably priced for this neighborhood and it's definitely popular with the locals.  It's not quite as posh as Absinthe but has a charm all its own.

So many seem pretty sweet and tasty...I can easily see how the place earned its name.  \n\nDrinks are about average in price for mixed varieties, but I'm not sure about their cocktails.  They all seemed to be served in fairly large glasses though (and they all seemed pink...), so they might be worth the money even if they are priced higher as some people noted.  The bartenders seemed friendly enough, and one seemed to forget to tell me how much for me to pay.  I actually had to ask her what the tab would be just so I could make sure to put something down on the bar.\n\nThere are a few tables and couches towards the front for people to sit, along with some stools along the wall opposite the bar.  They also have a small room towards the back that lends some privacy from the main bar area.  It's probably pretty handy when you want some alone time, or at least to get away from some of the crowds.\n\nDefintely a place to go in the Hayes Valley area, and I'll probably try to come back for a HH to get the free appetizers (woohoo for free food!).

Sure, saving a buck is cool, but I need a little more oomph to be inspired to hit a happy hour gathering these days. This is where Sugar Lounge comes into play, as they go above and beyond nearly every other bar in the city taking a stab at conquering the Irish Commute.\n\nDuring Happy Hour, they not only have cheap beers and cocktails ($3 beers, $5 well drinks), but they also have free food! Everything from chips and salsa, lumpia, fried sweet potatoes, teriyaki chicken and more! It's hard to say that I'd be excited to pay for this food any other time, but seriously - as a free accouterment to the already-discounted drinks, it's pretty generous on their part. Plus - the chicken was darn good! Definitely worth the grand total of $free.99.\n\nFor as little as 180 pennies (not counting tip), you can acquire a nice post-work buzz and grub enough nosh to ensure you leave the bar feeling like you had a decent-sized meal.

The men at the bar began verbally attacking the women sitting in the lounge yelling at them and calling them names after the women showed no interest in their attempts to come on to them. The women looked uncomfortable and upset as the men at the bar continued  to talk nasty to them. The bartenders who were girls just sat and watched the whole thing, I believe they cut the guys off from drinks but continued to allow the nasty behavior without saying anything to the men or grabbing a bouncer ( who was no were in site till end of the night) as someone who works in the industry I can't believe this was allowed, I personally would never let people stay in my bar who were acting so inappropriate especially when it's men verbally abusing women, not cool. I would suggest giving the bartenders better training in making sure the environment is safe, the girls left upset and still getting yelled at by the men and I'm sure took their business elsewhere.

I am, by no means, a lightweight, but a few of those Black Widows were MEAN.\n\n-SATURDAY: There's a live DJ spinning hiphop and old-school classics. Called in a few days before to reserve 2 couches by the DJ for my birthday. No table service or bottle requirement to reserve these sitting areas for 5 stars for that. No dance floor, but we made a makeshift dancefloor between the couches and in front of the DJ. It was HOT. They need to do something about ventilation in there.

I've got ESPN like that. \n\nSo my friend Kiki and I walked from Civic Center BART to the Sugar Lounge, as I was calming off my slight buzz and mild depression. By the end of the night, I didn't have a care in the world! (except where I was going to puke it all back up, since I was taking BART home). \n\nThe outside was simple; lights, neon-lit sign spelling Sugar in sweet, sweet cursive. Walk in, and it was just...cool. I got that \"I can dig it\" vibe, and a smile was on my face in no time. We sat at the bar and said \"let's be adventureous and try their drink specials\". At first, I didn't really want to drink much--I already got super buzzed that day (its what happens when you're my weight and haven't eaten in two days..after only 2 beers). But you only live once, and I just got my paycheck, so what the hell. \n\nBreanna, our bartender, was just super AWESOME! She mentioned two drink specials that weren't on the menu, and those were the ones we went with. Kiki got a whiskey and coke, even though she gets a little frisky when she drinks it and I was feeling anything but that, and I got the drink, as I coined it--a Breannatini. It had tuaca french liqueur, mandarin organe vodka, vanilla vodka, splash of sweet & sour and pomegranete juice. Garnished with a lemon and sugar rim, omg was that tasty.\n\nWait--I'm a little hungover, still. That was the second drink. The first one I wrote down on a napkin seemed to have slipped off the table in my drunken stupor, DAMMIT! Just tell Breanna that the girl who called it a Breannatini with the cranberry sugar rim, said to get it. She'll know what you're talking about.\n\nBoth of them, ah man. She even took some frozen blackberries and put them in my drink. Didn't do anything for the flavor, but its the perfect ending to a good drink--some alcohol flavored fresh fruit. Yum!!!!!!!!!\n\nI decided I was going to start mentioning bathrooms at places, after my blissful experience at Jimisan with the smelling good and all that. Theirs had a full length mirror. Not good for drunk panda. I had to leave or else I would have started dancing. It was decorated nicely, though, I will admit. \n\nMy third and last drink of the night I believe was on the house--a Mint Chocolate Chip Martini. If you drink more than two sugary drinks, please, please avoid drinking this third one at all costs. I love Breanna for giving it to me, as the \"dessert\" course to our \"meal\", but it tasted better going down than coming back up. \n\nIf you want to have the best martini ever, you would do yourself a favor and come here. Just remember--sugary drinks makey for talkin to a guy named ralph later on. Tread lightly. Thats my warning to you.", "author": "Jaime L."}

She then came out with a flashlight and said, \"let me look on the floor to see if YOU dropped it.\"  He called the next day to talk to the manager and they apologized and said the girl was \"confused.\"  I think that means he should get a free drink, considering he has to come all the way back there for his card...just my two cents!\n\nSome might think 1 star is harsh, especially since this is one experience out of several, but you shouldn't give someone half a drink, you should be able to make the drink appropriately if you are a paid bartender, and you shouldn't lose a customer's debt card and then accuse him of not giving it to you (i.e., don't be a douche).\n\nIn sum, this place sucks!", "author": "Kevin M."}

A lovely lounge bar in Hayes Valley that is spacious with warm decor (without being too pretentious), comfortable couches, and adequate tables and bar stools. By far, one of the cleanest bar bathrooms, too! The vibe here is totally chill with friendly patrons, and even friendlier bartender(s). Great selection of wines, with some draft beers, champagne, and lots of special sweet mixed cocktails. Couldn't have picked a better spot  for a Sugary Sweet Swap UYE last Sunday http://www.yelp.com/events/san-francisco-sugary-sweet-swap!\n\nAfter a macaron crawl (Miette, La Boulange, and Paulette's), Patty and I parked ourselves at the front tables, awaiting the other sweet tooths. The bartender (whose name escapes me- so sorry, please forgive me) was super friendly and sweet, by allowing us to use the refrigerator for the chocolate covered strawberries that Patty made, and freezer for the Humphrey Slocombe ice cream that Alex brought. She even offered us plates and forks (without us having to ask)! When everyone arrived, as \"Eight is Enough\" (Nicole, Patty, Ana, Alex, Heidi, Tatyana, Kevin, and myself), we nibbled on Strawberry Shortcake, Chocolate Covered Strawberries, Rum Balls, Chocolate Covered Toffee, Oatmeal and Regular Chocolate Chip Cookies, Banana Bread, and Humphrey Slocombe Ice Cream (Secret Breakfast, Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee, and Guinness Gingerbread)! \nWe washed the sugary sweets with (of course) sugary drinks. Some had wine, and others had the specialty drinks/martinis. I forgot the name of my exact drink, but it had Mango (and that was the selling point for this Mango Freak)! It was super strong and kind of hit a few of us like a Long Island Iced Tea would. Regardless, can you say Massive Sugar Overload? \n\nOur bartender rocked, and she cleared the tables after every sweets round. We offered her and other bar patrons some of the cookies and sweets, which were much appreciated. When we thought our sugar fix was filled, our awesome bartender gave us a round of shots that tasted like a Lemon Dreamsicle (think Lemon Drop but with a hint of cream). \nThere was definitely a whole lot of sugar high and buzzing going on!\n\n*Special thanks to the Eight for RSVPing, attending, and bringing their sugary sweets! Hope you guys had as much fun as I did. Thanks for making the first UYE organized by Patty and myself a successful one.  \n\nSugar Lounge is truly a gem!

Why then am I giving this place only 3 stars? The happy hour drink specials are not very exciting. $3 beer and $4 well drinks. None of the special fun cocktails like my favorite, pomo lolita, is discounted. Even a more straightforward drink like Malibu sunrise cost $8 bucks. Although the price wasn't all that attractive, every drink I had was DELICIOUS! Top notch quality.  Plus 1 star. $4 LEMON DROP is the best deal for a fun drink here. However, minus one star for having no wine specials. :( I like wine just as much as I like beer and cocktails and I love to mix things up. (Dangerous, I know!)\n\nThe highlight of Sugar Lounge's happy hour specials is not the drinks but the free food!!! We got here a little before 6, and most of the good stuff was gone. I walked in, went straight for the buffet, and shamelessly cleaned out the hot food items which included teriyaki flavored chicken bites and super spicy jalapeno grilled cheese sandwiches. I also loaded my plate up with fresh fruits and passed on the chips and salsa. Fruits they serve here are actually quite fresh and not yucky or mushy which you may expect from free food. Thank you, Sugar Lounge. \n\nSo, if I like the buffet deal so much, why am I giving this place 3 stars? I like eating while I drink continuously. After the buffet was done, no food was available. This place doesn't serve food as part of their regular menu. This means that when the buffet is done, it's time for us to relocate to another bar that has more substantial food or a restaurant, which is exactly what we did. You could have kept us here and made loads of money, if you served food. A bar without food is not a place I can spend too much time in.\n\nIt's very dark here, so you can easily loose track of time.

One might even expect them to be able to serve these concoctions with style and flair if the establishment has style and flair.\n\nI do not think this is unreasonable, especially when your bar is trying to be this upscale lounge complete with fancy drinks, a super chic yet comfortable decor (with very cool melded glass light fixtures, worth their own mention), tasty finger food, a DJ spinning ambient music that makes you want to sway and a three tiered candy dish filled with chocolate. Obviously with a place this swank you are paying attention to detail, right? \n\nApparently bar tending skill is not on the list of things that you need to pay attention to when running a hip lounge. Sugar, in addition to their many sugary drinks that probably excite a lot of their clientele but do nothing for me, has about 30 scotches on their menu (and a long list of whiskey, tequila, vodka and gin) which makes me feel okay about having to watch a bunch of social climbers drink pink and aqua drinks out of a glass that should be reserved for gin with a splash of vermouth and an olive. \n\nI decided, last night, to order the Lagavulin 16 year, neat (once the bartender came back in from her smoke break). She had me repeat my order 3 times. At first I thought maybe she liked listening to me speak but then she pulled down a bottle of Laphroaig and asked if 15 year was okay. I informed her, with what I am sure was an incredulous look on my face but a kind tone to my voice, that she had not even pulled the same brand I ordered, forget the year. She actually had to ask the bar back to help her identify my order after I had to, for a 4th time, repeat the name and point to it on the menu. \n\nThen....... the horror!!! She pours it over ice. ICE!!! I thought I was going to lose it, but I kept cool as a cucumber. I told her, in a smooth but assertive way, as the atmosphere dictated, that this is no way to treat a lady or a scotch. So what does she do then? She takes a cocktail strainer and strains it out of the ice into another cup and walks away. \n\nSorry, no amount of cool makes up for that, no amount of cool at all.", "author": "Drue C."}

The crowd was thin, and I was feeling more like throwing back a pint of ale somewhere dark, loud, and kinda sticky. \n\nActually, I'm lying. I was feeling more like going to sleep.  And I don't think anything I've ever done to a pint of ale that qualifies as throwing it back. \n\nI do like a dark, loud, and kinda sticky bar. This kind of bar probably also has a pool table where one of the balls is missing, but you can still play 9 ball if you pretend the 14 is a 4.\n\nAnyway, Sugar is not that bar. You can't even GET a pint at Sugar. Sugar is a very pink cocktail lounge. \n\nI have nothing against very pink cocktail lounges. But when I'm in a very pink cocktail lounge mood (which, I will admit, is rare), I'm probably not going to go to Hayes Valley. It just strikes me as a little out of place.\n\nAnother reason for my ambivalence towards Sugar was that I seem to be out of practice with bars in general, because this happened:\n\nBartender: What'll it be?\nMe: (looks around, disoriented)\nBartender: ...\nMe: Uhh...?\nMcV: Do you have, like... specials? \nBartender: We have 3 cocktails for $2.\nMe: Wheee! (giggles)\nBartender: Blue Hawaiian, Chocolate Raspberry Martini Or Black Cherry Brandy Vodka and Soda.\nMcV: We'll take one of each!\nMe: No, you fool. That is THREE drinks!\nMcV: Really? \n\n(It would be super awesome if he had actually interpreted Blue Hawaiian Chocolate Raspberry Martini as one drink. That would be quite a drink indeed)\n\nMe: We would like TWO of them.\nBartender: Which ones?\nMe: Uhh... Can I have the Cherry one with Diet Coke?\nBartender: Uhh...\nMe: Or is that gross?\nBartender: Uhh...\nMe: OH CRAP you mean soda like tonic water, not soda like choose my favorite soda, um, nevermind, I'll just have that one with soda soda. \nMcV: What were the drinks again?\nBartender: Blue Hawaiian...\nMcV: I'll have that!\nMe: What's in it?\nBartender: Uhh...\nMe: Nevermind, I'll just drink whatever it is.\nBartender: OKAY. I'm going to have to see some ID here.\n\nThat's when you KNOW you've fully humiliated yourself.  To be fair, the bartender was a very good sport during this whole disastrous exchange.\n\nThe cocktails were ... worth $2 each. (Especially because there were also free Tootsie Rolls and Hershey Kisses at the bar!) \n\nBut even for $2, drinking sweet cocktails in a very pink lounge just isn't as fun as throwing back a pint of ale (okay FINE, daintily sipping a pint of ale) somewhere kinda sticky.", "author": "Liz G."}

Right guys?\"  Then the popular kids would smirk, say \"Yeah, you too\", and proceed to beat the snot out of him for trying to bring his nerdy, awkwardness into their circle?

In other words, Sugar has the trappings of being a cool bar, but it's so inept that it can't even achieve that.  The DJ played the exact same \"tsst, tsst, tsst\" beat under EVERY song (and they weren't good songs, either.)  The crowd was self-obsessed and WEIRD (yeah, the two guys sitting next to us arguing who's better Usher or Kanye West would've been GENIUS...if they hadn't been serious.)  One bartender kept the drinks flowin', but the other three spent the night congregated in the corner gossiping and only poured drinks for their friends.\n\nWe left after I'd gone up to the bar to order another round of drinks.  The manager wondered up to me, and asked me to dance.  (Turns out, she'd asked all the guys in the room, and I was just the next on the hit list.)  When I said no, she interrupted the conversation of two girls next to me and said, \"He doesn't want to dance!\"  (Was she trying to embarrass me, or herself?)  Then she said \"Well at least buy some jello shots, they're only a dollar!\"  Jello shots?  What, am I at a frat party?  No thanks.

He pointed to a little, tiny, teeny, dare I say lilly-puttian sign on the table that said *reserved*. \n\nThe rest of the bar was now packed with girating marina-style blondes and the men who want them, so moving to a different location at sugar was not an option. This seemed really insane particularly considering we had called in advance about reserving a table, had arrived early so that we could all hang out together, and had been drinking and tipping for 2 hours, and were now essentially being kicked to the curb.

Comfy and roomy, they're a nice place to chill out with some friends (or an intimate date) and enjoy one of their singular cocktails (I'm quite a fan of their cosmos - though sometimes they go a little ape shit with the colored sugar on the rim.  Note to bartenders ... cosmos are sweet enough as it is without granular particles of green sugar collecting at the bottom of the glass!)\n\nI like the decor.  Vaguely dark in an almost erotic way, the artwork would have to be declared esoteric and somewhat moody.

You GO, Mister Native Intelligence!\n\nAnd I like that mysterious round table hidden away in the back, behind the toilettes.

Thankfully, unlike so many of the bars in San Francisco that have adopted the \"P-shaped layout\" as I like to call it (you enter the place, and there is a long bar with minimal space between the bar and wall until you get to the end where there is a large open area to congregate -- makes me feel cramped), Sugar is fairly open. There is some couch seating near the window, a nice counter to rest your drink, and a small area  in the back near the DJ stand.\n\nI am glad to see that Sugar has kept the small little half-moon room in the back -- it is nice for a quiet conversation or small gathering or 3-4 people. The drinks I had at Sugar were good and reasonably priced. Unlike the experiences of others, I found the service to be quick and friendly.

The same night they seemed to have a private party with appetizers that took up too much room at the entrance was the same night they just opened the place up for general admission.

It was some of the best music that I've heard since I've moved to San Francisco.\n\nThe drinks were a bit pricey after happy hour, but I was sticking to beer anyway. The beer is reasonably priced all night, and it doesn't suffer from the often cited lack of alcohol that their frou frou drinks do.\n\nSugar Lounge is a great place to meet up with friends in a relaxed environment. The lounge cleared out about an hour after happy hour, and it became really easy to talk to friends and new acquaintances. I would definitely recommend Sugar Lounge for a mid-week place to spend time with your friends.

It IS a cool bar, but maybe it's just better earlier on versus later at night.  Around 1am last Saturday, it seemed like most people were observing vs enjoying, and the dance floor was basically two gap-clothes guys grabbing their girls from behind, pulling their butt into their crotch, and then doing the circular grind.  Not pretty.  I still think Place Pigalle rules.\r\n\r\nOk, revised review....finally went to happy hour. Their dj duane rocks!  Tues-Sat early nights.", "author": "Melanie C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-03", "description": "Sugar, as the name implies, specializes in sweet drinks. Sweet, fruity drinks in sugar-rimmed martini glasses. With its pink neon logo and designer interior, this place just screams, GIRLY DRINKS! I happen to dislike sweet drinks, and just about anything that alludes to Sex and the City, so one would naturally conclude that I dislike Sugar.\n\n\n Wrong For the most part.\n\n\n On weeknights, it's a fantastic place to get a cocktail or two. They provide a classy and relaxed environment in which I can imbibe in a heavily poured vodka soda or a decent Scotch, eat some complimentary munchies, and kick back to some groovin' tunes. The bathrooms are clean, there's always a tray of candy on the bar, and the bartenders are attentive and friendly. In fact, despite the drinks being a bit on the pricey side, I can't think of a nicer Hayes Valley bar to visit when it's not crowded.\n\n\n Note that qualifier: When it's not crowded.\n\n\n Come Friday or Saturday, though, and it's a whole 'nother ball game. In addition to the amazingly weak pours, it gets uncomfortably hot, the music gets cranked up a few hundred decibels too many, and service can lag. Not to say that it's a lost cause on weekends. Luckily for the local barflies, it seems to be more of a pre-party hangout, and in the wee hours before closing, it can be fun again. In fact, it's a decent place to stop by after a late dinner at Suppenkuche or on the way home from elsewhere, providing the douchey post-work/pre-club crowd has cleared out and moved on to hoovering rails at Ruby Skye or whatnot.\n\n\n This seems to be the problem with the majority of non-dive bars in San Francisco: On weekend nights, they become sweaty, loud, crowded dweeb corrals. So I won't hold it against Sugar from suffering the same problem as other bars. That'd be like blaming them for a 2am bar time.\n\n\n What I will hold against Sugar is the lack of beers on draft. Man can't live on vodka and whiskey alone, and I'll be damned if I'm going to order some frou frou pink cocktail rimmed with crunchy sugar crystals. Perhaps I'm not secure with myself, but I still like my drinks on the manly side.", "author": "Omid T."}

Pretty nice place, but it was kind of on the small side, drinks were okay, and the food was very so so.\n\nThe main thing that was good was the atmosphere it provided. Given that its near a lot of dining, the symphony, and work, the crowd was cool. Didn't feel ghetto or anything like that. The warm color schemes and full bar felt like a very comfortable place to just hang out for a few drinks, but the downfall was when it got full. A ton of people turned out for this going away party and it got packed... quick! So it got hot and crowded making it a voyage through a sea of people trying to get to the bar. \n\nThe drinks were good. I only had Henn on the rocks, but I didn't feel cheated out of my money.

They had free food out and cheap drinks, the bar staff was super friendly, smiling, no attitude.  It was a great place to kick it at the bar and chit chat.  There was a birthday party going on, but that didn't make the place too crowded, they were kind enough to offer us some cake.  I will definitely go back and try one of their sugary cocktails and more than likely spend more time trying to lick the sugar off the rim than actually enjoying the drink.

As she squeezed strawberries for juice, she derisively commented to one of her fans \"this is coming off the menu - what a pain!\"  Um - you are a bartender which entails making bar drinks.\n\nLater watched as a group of two Asian couples stand near the bar considering whether to stay:  bartender failed to greet them but continued texting on phone as she had throughout night.

Ladies, take note, you're not going to meet any guys in this crowd. \n\nNow, in the past I've at least been able to count on getting a decent drink at Sugar -- its one redeeming quality. But the well vodka the bartender used to make my vodka last night was the worst-tasting vodka I can remember ever drinking, except the cheap shit in huge bottles we drank in college when we had no money.

(and she's easy on the eyes, too:) But I have gone on the occasional Saturday night, and it can get pretty hoppin, one particular Sat night it was freakin nuts!!! and speakin of hoppin, the last Saturday of every month is FLAVOR night, a hip hop party w/ a small cover and a group who takes over the sound system.\nAnd Sundays is happy hour all night (certain beers $3, wells $4). If you're lookin for a cool place to grab a quick drink before, during (yes, you can bring outside food in) or after dinner, or if ya just wanna sit and chill on a Sunday night (like me) then, Sugar Lounge is the place to go. \nAnd if you have an i-pod and ask really nicely, Brenna will hook up your i-pod to the sound system.  And if it's not too too busy, you can even play a friendly game of bones.\nAnd Bartendress Nicki looks like Drew Barrymore(at least to me, she does)\nOh, and they are fairly well known for being heavy pourers.", "author": "Phil R."}

I've only been in once and plan to drink there again when the situation permits.\n\nrecommended to those who either have tired of the other places on Hayes Street or who cannot get into the crowded places in the area.", "author": "Richard D."}

Saturday night my girl and I are going out on date night, thought we would try this place. We got there around 6:30 pm, bar was a little full with a few stools open. A couple of girls moved over for us so we could sit together, that was very nice of them. Bartender hardly notices us, finally comes over we told him our drink order. The drinks were very good, here's where the problem is. You do not serve food, did not see hors d'oeuvres, bartender has NO PERSONALITY and he looks BORED. We bought the girls that moved over a round of drinks for being nice. Genius bartender never asked the girls if they want the drinks, or informed them that we would like to buy them a drink. Bartender puts the glasses of wine in front of them, within 3 minutes they leave, they are going to the play. Glasses of wine almost untouched. By the way, Bartender never said more than 3 words to us. So, to the Bar owner, Why would I come back to your place? I wouldn't, there is nothing there. You offer nothing, no food, no bartender with a personality, nothing. Too bad.", "author": "joy e."}

The bartenders looked completely annoyed to be there and had obviously no desire to be serving anyone. Without a single smile or greeting, they stood around looking bummed out, cell phones in hand. Is there table service? Is there a drink menu? Can someone please be interested enough to make eye contact so I can order? I don't need my hand held when I go out but I would appreciate a little customer service. I expect the emo thing at a dive bar in the Mission but not from an \"upscale\" lounge in Hayes Valley. I am a bartender myself and I never forget that tipping is not required. You are paying for a service and if that service is not given then I don't expect a tip. There are way too many bars in San Francisco to treat your customers like their presence is unwelcome and in these times can anyone really afford to lose a customer?", "author": "Caitlin F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-28", "description": "This place has great drinks and great music. Its rare to find a lounge in SF that you can just meet up with a group of friends and enjoy listening to dance music without going to a club. I think Sugar Lounge is the perfect venue for that. I was there for a few hours on a Saturday and I noticed that it doesn't ever become too crowded and if you get there early enough you can secure a place at the bar and just hang out there all night. I would recommend this place if you're looking for a fun venue to hang out with friends. The drinks are pricey but the music is great so its worth it.", "author": "N S."}

I'm down to try inventive cocktails with interesting ingredients and ordered the 'pear bear' made with grey goose pear vodka, passion fruit and mango juices. it wasn't bad, in fact it was pleasant but a little on the weak side (coming from someone who drinks vodka on the rocks!). the bartender was really friendly and chatty with us and that was cool. she was pretty cute too :P", "author": "kristin e."}
