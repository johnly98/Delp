The fried chicken was really dry and overcooked, the breading was way thick and not well seasoned. I couldn't finish my piece. \n\nGumbo 3/5: Flavor was okay, but it felt lacking in ingredients and felt a little bare.\n\nBanana foster bread pudding: 5/5 Delicious!! The texture was awesome. The outside was caramelized and crunch and inside was soft and gooey. Very flavorful and rich. \n\nService was lacking.

The fried pickles came out and was really tasty, hot and fresh and paired really well with the spicy aoili. But after that it all went downhill... After we got our pickles it took a full 30 minutes until we got our next dishes. During that time I saw that they did have a lot of orders going out for to go, and I understand they have to fulfill those but I think it's also important to care for your customers in store. During that time the waitresses never came to check on us or to let us know what's going on or how much longer the food would take. But usually I don't mind waiting if the food was worth the wait. Unfortunately it wasn't.\n\nWhen we finally got our chicken I was expecting some juicy chicken with explosive flavor but instead we got four pieces of pretty dry chicken with bland flavor. The crust was crunchy though. The collard greens were actually pretty good, and the mashed potatoes and gravy were only subpar. The mac and cheese did come out hot and bubbly so that was actually some good mac and cheese.\n\nOverall I am really underwhelmed by both the service and the food here. Definitely not worth the time or money to come here.", "author": "Hilary C."}

This restaurant has a rather dark interior but we were here early enough to snag one of the tables outside.  The menu is basically soul food. \n\nWe were given nice corn bread as amuse and we had the squash fritters as appetizers.  Both were great. I ordered the 4 piece fried chicken with collared greens and mashed potatoes and my friend had the vegan jambalaya. \n\nThe fried chicken was good and not really greasy though it's not the best fried chicken in town (to me, that belongs to Brenda's).  The collared greens and mashed potato were great though. I would come back here again for the chicken. Maybe even get the bucket. \n\nService was good and attentive and it's great value - our meal including one drink, tax and tip ended up being $45 per person.

Whenever I am in The City and want some good Southern food I choose to stop by The Front Porch. As the name suggests, it is very warm and welcoming place to start out your day. The food and service has been great every time I stop by and they change out some of their menu items every so often to keep things fresh. On our last visit, we tried out their Corn Bread Pudding. The server did warn us that it was on the sweeter side but we got it as an app anyways. He was right, it was sweet, but very good. It had the consistency of a dense cake, with all of the great flavors of a corn bread.

I would order more of these next time!The menu is pretty extensive so we ordered a bunch of things to share. For four people, this was plenty of food:  the fried green tomatoes, the braised beef, shrimp and grits, and fried chicken thighs. Everything was soooo good and cooked to absolute perfection. Stand-outs were the fried green tomatoes and their famous fried chicken. They even had gluten-free fried chicken on their menu for my gluten-intolerant friend, which was a bonus, since fried food is generally a no-go for her.

I'm glad I finally brought the bf here, and he and our out-of-town friend thoroughly enjoyed it. We definitely ate too much but it's hard not to with so much good food on the menu.\n\nRESERVATIONS: We had dinner at 7:30 on a Thursday. I made the reservation online day in advance, plenty of openings. There would've been no wait on the porch (no reservations, dog-friendly seating).\n\nTHE COST: $60 total per person, including tax/tip. We got several drinks, 2 starters, 1 side, 3 entr\u00e9es, and 1 dessert.\n\nTHE FOOD:\n* Free cornbread - 3 stars\nNot great, not terrible. On the dry side, definitely need that butter. \n\n* Gumbo w/ Chicken, Andouille ($8) - 2.5 stars\nToo much soup, very little rice & chicken. \n\n* Crawfish Hush Puppies ($11.50) - 2.5  stars\nToo much of the bread, which was dry, not enough crawfish filling.\n\n* Tea Brined Pork Chop ($24) - 4 stars\nPretty delicious. The pork was moist and had great flavor. I loved the brown butter yam puree also.\n\n* Burger ($14.50, +1 Cheddar, +$2.50 Bacon) - 4.5 stars\nVery delicious. Soft bun, juicy moist patty, definitely very oily but worth it. However, the fries were terrible. They looked like the type I like (thick, almost wedge-like, with a light crisp and soft filling), but they were incredibly dry, all bad crisp with no filling, and clearly had been frozen.\n\n* Fried Chicken, 4 piece ($19.50) - 3.5 stars\nDepending on the cut, some of the meat was dry, some more moist. The breading was nice & crunchy.\n\nSIDES\n* Baked Mac & Cheese ($8.50) - 4 stars\nYum, loved this, tons of great cheese & soft, well-cooked macaroni.\n\nDESSERT\n* Bourbon Pecan Pie ($9) - 3.5 stars\nVery rich, with buttery crust and nice filling that wasn't just compacted puree but had a lightly crumbly texture.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

We ordered the biscuits, the baked mac and cheese, the grilled asparagus (not pictured), and the shrimp and grits.\n\nBiscuits: served with a rosemary butter and some kind of jam. It was so hot and flakey, definitely made to order. This ended up being my boyfriends favorite dish out of the ones we ordered.\n\nMac and Cheese: If you are a mac and cheese fan, this is a must get. I am usually not a fan of baked mac and cheese because the top is usually too crusty and the cheese usually gets hard and clumpy when the dish cools, however this was NOTHING like that. The cheese was creamy and delicious and never got hard. By far the best homemade mac and cheese I have had.\n\nGrilled Asparagus: nothing special but a really good way to balance out all of the heavy, rich foods. \n\nShrimp and Grits: Another amazing dish! the shrimp was perfectly cooked and the grits were so creamy.

Service was great:  attentive & friendly. Staff works together.  So anyone was happy to serve.\n\nWe really enjoyed ourselves here.  I did find that two of our spoons were dirty but were swiftly replaced.  Our chosen \"Porch Bevies\" were the \"Okie Dokie Artichokie\" (an orange bitters bourbon cocktail with a refreshing, hint of sweet taste) and \"Donkey D's Hot Ass Margarita\" (refreshing cocktail with just the right amount of jalapeno kick).  I deviated to a nice glass of albarino once the food started arriving.  \n\nOur ravenous appetites took over when ordering.  So the overload of fried fare really hit us food coma style towards the end.  Our indulgences:  \n\nChicken Gumbo with andouille and okra - great flavor but very skimpy in the ingredients which took away from the gumbo's full flavor potential \n\nCrawfish Hush Puppies - good but more breaded action than crawfish which was barely present.\n\nFried Pickles - The skinniest pickle slices inside the batter was sad.  I would pass.  The pickles themselves aren't very \"dill\" either.  The Tabasco aoli was a tasty dip though.\n\nCajun Boudin Balls - pork & chicken liver with dirty rice and honey mustard dip was full of the meaty flavors.  This one delivers with the honey mustard dip.  \n\nFried Okra - These were tasty bite sized pieces with the breaded coating used sparingly.  The jalapeno dip could have used more jalapeno is all.\n\nFor the entree, we shared the 4 piece fried chicken.  Yummy, yummy, tasty, juicy goodness...and that includes the breast also!  The coating was thick enough with a light flavor not to over power the fresh chicken taste.  Garlic mashers were satisfying.  The collards greens were decent.  I didn't taste any ham hock though.\n\nThe other main entrees look enticing.  There is a pleasant, upbeat energy to the atmosphere conducive to fun.

Thank God it did.\n\nThe chicken was quite tender and juicy - not bland but if it's not flavorful enough, they have a nice hot sauce too you can lather on.  You get three pieces of Mary's sustainable chicken along with a huge waffle, so it's quite a meal.  The waffle was almost just perfect, made with cornmeal and bacon (how can you go wrong with that combination?!).  I only wish it was a little crispier on the sides, but that's just me.  Once you leave the chicken on top for too long it can get a wee bit soggy from the steam.\n\nNote that you do have to wait about 25 minutes for the chicken and waffle though, so get yourself a starter or something to drink while you're waiting.\n\nThis front porch is definitely my favorite front porch.

It was super flavorful and well seasoned. The waffle was delicious as well. The portion was huge and I could only finish half of it!\n\nIf you're not in the mood for waffles, you can order just a side of chicken as well (or go for the bucket of chicken).\n\nThe mac and cheese is a hot favorite as well, but everything soon becomes way too heavy for brunch and you can barely finish the food.\n\nI had a great time, and the food is mighty delicious.

The biscuit that came with my meal was hard as a rock and nearly frozen. I asked the waiter to heat the biscuit up for me, and that didn't help at all my biscuit literally tasted like flour. All in all the fruit I ordered on the side was the best part of my meal. \nAtmosphere: This is a very small restaurant! I was only in a party of two so I didn't anticipate on waiting too long, especially because the host said we would be sitting at the bar since we didn't have reservations. We waited at least an hour to be seated. An hour is not that long to wait, but you have to take into account there is no where for you to sit and wait for a table. After waiting the longest hour of my life the host immediately sat us in a table for two outside. San Francisco in March is FREEZING! Host didn't even ask if it we wanted to sit outside. The outdoor seating did have a small heater above only 1/2 of the table, that was on my half of the table, and was on full blast the entire time I was at this restaurant....I couldn't feel even the slightest bit of heat!

The interior is pleasantly decorated in and eclectic 1970's bohemian fashion evoking memories of the endless summer that California has always be legendary for. Lighting is low so it takes tine to get your eyes adjusted but then the decor makes up for it.  An old school bar dominated the main eating area. This is a brunch post so no libation was ordered today.  The food is decidedly southern.  Being a Texas transplant this of course merited extreme scrutiny so we ordered the biscuits and gravy, fried okra and the country breakfast plate.  \n\nThe okra is off the freaking chain. Perfectly deep fried the spicy batter really compliments the  okra perfectly. I haven't had this good an okra since Amarillo. The biscuits are freshly made and not massive monsters most chain restaurants like to put out. The dough is sweet an is perfectly set off by the real white flour gravy.  Southern food test passed with flying colors!\n\nThe country dish consisted of tater tots (spicy and stupidly addictive), perfectly done eggs, and REAL HOUSE SMOKED BACON.  WTF?? You can taste the mesquite smoke!  The tots were covered by a bit of spicy chili saut\u00e9ed onions. We are so coming back here for the ribs. \n\nA note on the staff.

Thankfully we reserved before or otherwise we would have had to wait for a very long time. The place was busy and lively, and there was a lot going on. \n\nSomething that bothered me was the poor lighting. It might have been just our table, but I could barely read the menu. My table had to use the flashlights on our phones to even properly read the menu. Another thing that bothered me was the lack of service. There were often times that my table tried to order something or get a refill on water, but the service was not there. This might have been due to how crowded the restaurant was at the time.\n\nMoving on to the food: my table ordered shrimp hushpuppies (deep fried cornmeal) as an appetizer and I personally ordered the fried chicken dinner (4 pieces of fried chicken with mashed potatoes and gravy, collared greens, and popcorn).\n\nThe hushpuppies were disappointing. The hushpuppies were small, and there wasn't very much shrimp at all, and they only gave four hushpuppies for 8 dollars, which is a little outrageous to me.\n\nThe chicken dinner though was great. The chicken dinner came with four big pieces of chicken meat. Two white meat pieces and two dark meat pieces. The fried chicken was extremely juicy and the breading was good. In my opinion, this place has really great fried chicken. The mashed potatoes were plain, and the gravy was not good, almost every other gravy I've had with mashed potatoes were better. The collard greens had a very strong tangy taste. Which might be a turn off to some people, but I personally enjoyed them. Also, the chicken dinner came with some popcorn which was fun to eat.\n\nOverall, this place has great fried chicken and collard greens, but everything else seemed average/mediocre. I would recommend people to try the fried chicken, but given the price and quality of everything else it would be difficult to recommend anything else.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

Aside from that not a single thing was bad. I also got the hangover helper which was good but I think I should have stuck to the baked mac and cheese. \n\nMy friend got the po' boy fried chicken (burger) and was very tasted. I feel like the fried chicken here is very breaded but the batter that it is fried in is a bit different from other places. I think it has more of a cajun spice to it which I really like. I do normally prefer my fried chicken to have a decent amount of crunch but it was a little more than I was use to but it wasn't a bad thing. I would definitely be back at this place and probably try the shrimp and grits along with the hush puppies which they have later in the day.

This is a neighborhood spot that reflects the surrounding area.  It's funky, fun, doesn't take itself too seriously and contains hidden gems behind the simple porch setting outside.\n\nI had my eye and stomach on the spicy shrimp and grits.  It's one of my go-to dishes, especially when I'm in the South so I was eager to see how the Front Porch interpreted this dish.  My friend ordered the 4 piece fried chicken, which came with mashed potatoes and collard greens.\n\nThe shrimp and grits were creamy and dreamy.  I thought the dish was boldly flavored but not particularly spicy.  I did add some hot sauce to the dish.  The shrimp was tender and fresh.  There were pieces of andouille sausage in the gravy.  I would definitely order this dish again.\n\nThe fried chicken was okay.  I only tried the breast meat and found it juicy and tender.  The crust clung to the meat and was well seasoned.  While it wasn't my favorite it was still quite good.  The potatoes were okay but needed the gravy.  The collards were well prepared.  I could have eaten another portion of them.\n\nI ordered the French Quarter cocktail, which I found refreshing, elegant and not too boozy.  My friend ordered the margarita, described as \"hot ass\".  Indeed, it was darned spicy!  Buyer beware.  This drink definitely has a kick.  \n\nThe room is dark and the room can get loud.  The tables are on the smaller side so folks will get to know their neighbors.  I saw families with young children, groups of friends, couples on dates with what appeared to be a mostly local crowd.  \n\nParking nearby was not that difficult.

The porch does have a few rocking chairs, but they were full when we came by.\n\nWe were seated right away and brought a couple pieces of baby corn bread. It came with some whipped butter. \n\nFor a starter, we ordered the deviled eggs with bacon bourbon jam. If you notice the pricing, it costs $6.66. Very cleaver. The deviled eggs were good. The flavoring is all in the bourbon jam. \n\nFor dinner, we shared the fried chicken: 4 piece. It came with garlic mashers & gravy and ham hock collards. I've had my fair of southern cuisine and I am really impressed with the flavors. The chicken came with 2 larger pieces, a wing, and a drum. The outside of my first piece was flavorful and crispy and the inside was juicy. My second piece was a little different. The juices from the collards had leaked over so the skin was soggy, but the inside was still juicy. \n\nI also tried their hot sauces. The red/orange one was tangy like buffalo sauce. The yellow one has a slow heat. The more you eat, the hotter it feels. \n \nThe only reason this wasn't a 5 star experience was where we were seated.

The service is a bit slow, and since I'm a firm believer in good service when you go out to a sit down restaurant, I didn't think it measured up to other restaurants that are in the same category. It was a bit overpriced considering the menu items. I also personally don't think it's helpful to tell your customer that everything is good when they're trying to narrow down their options.\n\nAnyway, we started with the fried green tomatoes. They were delicious. The sauce that was plopped on top was a bit overwhelming and given in excess, but it tasted fine if you scraped some of it off. We ordered the bucket of fried chicken since we were in the mood for hearty, southern/soul food. There was a lot of chicken to split among three of us and plenty left over that were taken home. We had the mash, creamed corn, and mac for sides. My favorite was the creamed corn. There was obvious truffle flavor, which I love. For dessert, we had to go with the beignets. They were big, but I've had better. It looked fluffy, but could be softer like actual beignets if they weren't overcooked.

It was really hard to eat and it had so much char from the grill I could taste it for a whole day later.  Hubby had the Dr Pepper short ribs way to sweet.  You need insulin after eating that.

The bf ordered the 1/2 rack of beef ribs which came with a side of beans and coleslaw. \nWe were served 2 tiny cornbread muffins along with some herbed butter. Not sure if this came with our gumbo or always comes to the table at the beginning of your meal. Either way, it was good. \nThe gumbo was so good but we should have ordered two appetizers. I definitely wanted more food once we were done sharing the cornbread and gumbo. I thought that this was OK though so we would have room for what was to come. \nOur food arrived and the breading on my fried chicken was...well no other way to describe it than burnt. I had read reviews about the golden breading of the fried chicken so I was really looking forward to this. I had to peel mine off because I'm not into burnt breading. It really turned me off but I proceeded in eating some plain chicken. I went after the greens as I was looking forward to those as well but they was so much vinegar in them that I just couldn't. The mashed potatoes and gravy were the best part of my dinner... though they didn't taste like they had much garlic in them. \nThe BF's ribs that he ordered were cooked nicely but had a lot of dry rub on them for sure. Beans that came with the plate were very rich. We ordered some red beans and rice also and they were very good. \nThey have a full bar and I ordered a basic margarita which had way too much triple sec or something of the like in it.

Biscuits & gravy and the FRIED OKRA with jalapeno aioli. Yum! \n\nTheir fried chicken is probably the most popular (takes 25 mins approx.). If you know you want it, order it fast so you don't have to wait long for it. Comes with huge pieces of chicken and a bacon waffle.\n\nI ordered the benedict with andouille sausage - yum!

Not only is the fried chicken some of the best you'll find in the city, but the service is very good. In fact, it stands out because it's so much better than it needs to be, as they're certainly not hurting for business. I've been here a couple of times and it's always at least an hour wait for a table.\nWe ordered a bucket of chicken. It was tender and juicy through and through. The most variable and differentiating factor with fried chicken is the batter. The batter is relatively thick but not bready. It is golden brown and crispy throughout. It's well spiced and they provide two kinds of house hot sauce. Seriously delicious. I often am tempted to peel off the breading when I have fried chicken. Never here! \nWe also got collard greens, which were perfectly cooked and not light on the ham, as well as rice and beans, which were great, heavy on the tomatoes and peppers. They come vegetarian but you can choose to add sausage. We opted for veggie and it was great. There's other stuff on the menu, but I find it hard to imagine getting anything other than chicken. \nHere's why I'm really writing this review. I want to give a huge shout out to host Kevin. We came on a Tuesday night and put our name on the list for a 45 minute wait. The group of people I was with had some catching up to do, so it was no big deal. We went to rock bar and had some manhattans while we waited. (Owned by the same folks, check it out.)\nSometimes wait estimates go wrong. We ended up waiting for maybe an hour and a half, but you know what, shit happens. Servers can't control how long tables stay occupied. We were deep in conversation and not worried about it at all. Kevin seemed so distressed to have our wait extended, and he more than made up for it. He hooked us up with free appetizers, and was absurdly grateful when we were cool about the whole thing. The point is he really cared about our experience. I wish I knew our server's name because she was great, too. We had a lovely evening despite the wait! \nTLDR: food is great, rare good service in SF, don't miss it", "author": "Anna P."}

The chicken was on point, and since I know how to fry and make amazing chicken, this was the real deal. It was definitely soaked in buttermilk before hand(secret of juicy, moist chicken). The skin was full of flavour and spices...yes! I got a side of baked macaroni and cheese, which I paid extra for, greens, and hushpuppies. I was not impressed by the Mac and Cheese, but I'm picky in that regards. I also got a cocktail that was delicious, and my husband got standard martinis and the white wine that was recommended to go with the chicken.  We also got the crawfish hushpuppies, which I'd give a pass on because they don't taste like what I know to be hushpuppies (they were also a mite overpriced at $11..That's a $7-8 item).\n\nHowever, I came to leave a review for the greens!!! These are REAL Southern greens, cooked just like the ones I grew up eating in the South. The secret to good greens is you need to add a little sugar, or honey, to cut the bitterness, when you cook them. It brings out the delicious flavour, and these greens had some vinegar in them, too.  I genuinely raved about them to the people working there...y'all just don't know! Real greens cooked the right way are nearly impossible to find in a restaurant, so I always end up making them if I crave them.  However, it's awesome and surprising that I could find these in San Francisco!!\n\nI use a walker to ambulate, so when I made a reservation on Yelp, I mentioned that in my comments. They actually read it, and sat us at a table that was easy for us to get to, and store my walker. They have a portable ramp they can pull out to use for the bathrooms, since they are up a step, FYI.  The space is definitely cozy..I kind of felt like I was eating in someone's living room.

Refills were frequent which I appreciated\n\n-Beignets ($5): SO GOOD. The right size, fluffy and warm. These were served in half of a paper bag which was cute. I honestly could have eaten these by itself for breakfast. MUST ORDER. \n\n-Spicy Shrimp & Grits ($18)-This was my order and I am so glad I got it. While there were only 4 piece of Shrimp, the portion was really filling and I couldn't even finish my plate. The flavors were delicious and rich. I would kill to order this again\n\n-Chicken and Waffles ($17)-This was A's order and it was HUGE. 3 massive pieces of fried chicken over a belgian waffle. Holy shit. Let me just say that the fried chicken was AMAZING. A said it was the best he has ever had and I tend to agree. I cannot wait to come for dinner and get the plate of this. The waffle under it was okay, nothing special. A also couldn't finish his so we luckily got to eat leftovers after.\n\nOverall, this was a very reasonably priced brunch given the quality of food, size of the portion and attentive service. Neither of us expected to like this place that much and honestly, I think it is better than Brenda's across town. I cannot wait to come back and get dinner or drinks. Seriously, if you are in Bernal, you have got to come here.", "author": "Carrie W."}

This only adds to the charm and lends itself to the southern, New Orleans-y feel.  Two words: Fried Okra! Yes, please! Can't get enough of this! Okra is a finicky vegetable that can be divine or disgusting. The Front Porch successfully achieves divine every time.  I have tried a number of items on the brunch menu and have yet to find anything I was disappointed with.  The fried chicken po-boy is awesome! The pulled pork & sweet potato hash is amazing as well.   The servers are all friendly and very accommodating.

My husband and I visited this location with our three children and our youngest happened to be quite the handful that evening. The reason why I bring this up is because they brought a toy to try to settle him down which i truly appreciated and was unexpected. \n\n\nNow down to the food. My husband and I were impressed with the cornbread, fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, mac & cheese.  However we felt the hush puppies were over done and extremely tiny. The greens had  to much of like a vinger taste an almost no hammock in it.

The wait was about an hour or so with 6 parties in front of us, take that as you will whether or not that's a victory.\n\nFirst off was the gumbo. Perhaps it was me being famished but I wolfed down my half pretty quick. My only note that I can remember about the gumbo was that it tasted like it's a slightly elevated version of something I'd find in a can. I'd skip this should I ever come back.\n\nTo make up for that lackluster appetizer, we followed it up with the fried okra. This is the complete opposite reaction to the gumbo because these were fried to some kind of transcendent perfection. The batter was amazing and the jalapeno aioli gave it that perfect tip to make it over the top. Highly recommend!\n\nI had the chicken fried steak as my entree. The steak itself was a little tough, the tater tots weren't fried to being as crispy as I'd like, but the over easy eggs were done correctly. Still, I ate it all anyways because #hungry.\n\nMy friend ordered the shrimp poboy and it was pretty tasty the few bites I had. The fries that came with it (and my tots) had a cajun seasoning on it which was rather pleasant.\n\nAll in all; cool little place where you should order the fried okra.", "author": "Jonathan N."}

This place gets lots of praise from locals, food blogs, and Guy Fieri alike - and all for good reason. I've only had brunch here but tried a bunch of different items, some of which are offered at brunch and dinner time. Many people have already written tons about this great spot so I'll keep it to the highlights. \n\n-The chicken fried steak with gravy and cheesy grits was one of the best I've had and best value to quality to quantity ratio dishes I've had in San Francisco. The gravy had an amazing smoky rich flavor and the cheese grits were succulent, rich, and addictive. The steak was big and hearty and not so pounded out that the breading becomes the star of the show. For $13 I can't think of a better way to get filled up and satisfied in SF. \n\n-The blueberry cornbread bread pudding is completely ridic. Delicious, rich, moist, decadent, it was the perfect way to end brunch as a shared dessert. The texture is drier than your average bread pudding but moister than the typical cornbread. Fusion at its finest. \n\n-They take reservations for brunch. (Through Yelp! Wooo!)\n\n-Cons that almost made this a 4 star review: chicory coffee isn't really my thing, even though I still drank 4 cups of it. The eggs Benedict was a bit of a let down - not enough hollandaise and not enough Cajun flavor to really differentiate it from any other that I've had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-07-10", "description": "I always tend to mix up Front Porch with Portland's Screen Door. \nIf Front Porch had a screen door, or if Screen Door had a front porch, I would be really confused.\n\nThe Front Porch is a rather popular southern place in SF, and it's been on my list to try after acquiring a taste for Southern food (I used to hate fried food, but southern/cajun/creole is such a foodie genre, I jumped onto the fried chicken bandwagon.\n\nThe restaurant itself is a bit odd; the inside is very dark, and the tables are very high up compared to the seats. Unless you love eating in extremely poorly lit places, I suggest requesting the front porch tables, though it's limited. If I ran the place, I would either light up the inside better or turn more of the restaurant into front porch seating \u00e0 la Foreign Cinema outdoors seating with an invisible tarpe. Anyways, I shall proceed with the food review (and a warning about poor quality food pictures in the dim lighting.)\n\n(+) Corn bread with herb butter (complimentary): Bite-size corn bread that's indulgently buttery, made even tastier with the herb butter. I really liked how it was in small pieces because it was surprisingly filling, and you get a lot of crust (similar to the muffin top concept). One of the more memorable bites of the visit.\n\n(+/-) Fried corn on the cob with creole crema & cotija cheese ($6.50): The menu description sounded more exciting than it tasted, unfortunately. Basically buttery grilled corn with some melted cheese and chopped garlic. Interesting take that reminded me of Mexican food, but not particularly memorable.\n\n(++) Fried pickles with Tabasco aioli ($7): This was my favorite! Similar to fried zucchini, except the sourness of the pickle is magical with the panko batter. Although I couldn't taste much Tabasco in the aioli, the creaminess added a nice contrast.\n\n(+/-) Baked mac n cheese ($8): I liked the noodles, which were thick and shaped like something like elongated shells. (Difficult to tell in the dark lighting) The rich creaminess was satisfying, but it could do without the extra thick layer of cheddar cheese on top. Also, their selection of cheese seemed to ooze out a lot of oil.\n\n(+/-) 10-piece bucket of fried chicken ($29): Maybe it was the anticipation that this is one of their signature items, along with the fact that it was the longest wait, but the fried chicken failed to meet my expectations. The batter did have an overtone of a caramelized taste, but I found it too thick, greasy, and not crispy enough. I also think I prefer a more savory approach on fried chicken with ample black pepper, rather than Front Porch's more bland version with a hint of sweet. I hate to say this, but I honestly think I prefer KFC for the composition. On the plus side, Front Porch's comes in a cute bucket and popcorn.\n\nOverall, Front Porch is not bad but their style of heavy creaminess and greasiness just isn't for me. It's funny that I was initially disappointed since many plates seemed to look small, but turned out to be super filling due to all the lipids. I much prefer Buttermilk Kitchen for southern food, which has bolder, spicier flavors and is less greasy in my opinion. \n\nOn the plus side, Front Porch has rocking chairs, a mini rocking horse, and our server spoke with a southern accent.", "author": "Edna C."}

Also with a place like The Front Porch, you want to go with friends, especially friends from the south. So for my last dinner as an SF resident I recruited my friends and we got to enjoy a wonderful last meal.\n\nAs people have mentioned, it is a bit tight inside - As you walk past the cute little front porch (which does have heat lamps for those cold, winter nights) you enter into a small - I would barely call it a foyer by the door. There is a curtain, and I unfortunately learned that that curtain is there to protect the two patrons sitting at the bar from the cold. I had bumped into them and I apologize. If you don't have a reservation or good timing you may have to wait a bit to get a seat but we got the last table right in front of the kitche and by the restrooms (also protected by a curtain) and got to look at the menu.\n\nOur waitress quickly came and was delightful - she really made an effort to do all that she could. To start we wanted some drinks and the two men at the table got \"smoke gets in your eyes\", we're both mezcal fans and this sounded and tasted great. I ended up getting a second. The woman got a bottle of white wine which her man ended up getting a glass as well.\n\nFor the food we started with the following:\n-Blue Crab Hush Puppies with spicy remoulade - all of us are fans of hush puppies and you could really taste the crab. You had to dip it in the remoulade for the full flavor experience.\n-New Orleans style Beignets with powdered sugar - While usually for brunch or dessert, we started early. Well one of us did, I saved mine for dessert when you factor in the hush puppies.\n-Fried Okra with jalapeno aioli - So I'm a huge fan of okra, but my woman friend wasn't and she made that very clear. Whether out of irony or spite, our waitress gave us an order of these on the house. I thought they were great, esepcially with that aioli.\n-Biscuits - We're from the south, how could we not order these? Holy crap were they good, a buttery, flaky square of heaven.\n\nAs for the main meal, the restaurant currently had a special Beer Week menu, and while EVERY item sounded great, for simplicity's sake we went with the Bucket o' Chicken. They weren't kidding when they say bucket, and I really enjoyed the random bits of popcorn. They let us know ahead of time our bucket was missing two pieces, which they delivered shortly (with more popcorn!). The fried chicken was hot, moist, and spiced perfectly and I also introduced my friends to the wonder that is honey on fried chicken. Stuck with the white meat and got a breast and a wing. Both were great.\n\nAs for the side, I know we got baked mac & cheese and it went fast, regardless of the steaming hotness. I love mac & cheese and these were solid.\n\nSo as my last meal in town, I was more than content, I was southern fried full. And I even had a beignet for dessert!\n\nNotes:\n-Hot Sauces: they have a chile and a habanero. That Habanero will kick your ass, but it is worth it on okra, or chicken, or whatever.\n-Honey: Seriously, if you've never had honey on fried chicken (channel your inner mcnuggets and honey memories) you are missing out. Even better with the above hot sauces for a sweat and spicy combo!", "author": "Michael C."}

We got to the City in just under an hour and found parking around the corner (and walked past a dispensary, natch) with no problems. The front area and bar is small, but it's an elongated space and we squeezed into a round booth which would have better sat 8 but provided a cozy, raucous atmosphere.\n\nAfter dining here, I still can't figure if this place's roots are Cajun or Southern. Drink-wise, I started with a draft Abita something-or-another (natch, again), probably the standard Amber or Purple Haze, and followed that up with a Fieldwork IPA (one of their many). We picked up some starters, too. The fried pickles were good (hard to ever go wrong there) but the blue crab hush puppies were the hit.\n\nFor mains, the wife and I went with the fried chicken and the shrimp and grits. In that battle, the Southern side clearly came out the victor. The shrimp and grits were fine; Brenda's is better. The fried chicken, though, was fairly fantastic. As opposed to my younger days, I don't get the fried chicken much in the Bay Area (and even then, it's usually Popeyes Tuesdays, because you never go wrong there), but Front Porch's chicken plate is huge, tasty, and worth the cash outlay.\n\nBetween the plethora of food, availability of kids menus, and last minute large party availability, I'm counting this as a successful dining experience.", "author": "Jeffrey C."}

There's nothing confusing about the menu and there's nothing pretentious about the place. You can expect to have a delicious relaxing meal, which for me, takes me back to dinner on my parents front porch in the Midwest. On my first trip, I enjoyed the fried chicken - it was tender, crispy, salty, and delicious. On my second trip, I wanted to get back to my burger roots so I tried the Porch Burger with Pt. Reyes Blue and Bacon + cajun fries. This meal hit the spot while being highlighted by their amazing house made hot sauce, buy a bottle!

Anything from fried chicken to mac and cheese to gumbo will do. The Front Porch carries that southern charm, with quaint rocking chairs for the front patio seating, chill booth seating inside, laid back yet friendly service, and an open kitchen if you're seated near the back of the darkly-lit restaurant.\n\nOf course I had to try The Front Porch's fried chicken and waffle during this past weekend's brunch. The estimated prep and cook time for this dish is 25 minutes, but we received ours shortly after 15 minutes (the restaurant wasn't filled with diners though).\n\nThe fried chicken was delicious, with crispy, crunchy battered skin and moist, though borderline overcooked/ dry white breast meat. However, the cornmeal bacon infused waffle was divine - both the crispy edges and fluffy center were perfect. The medium-course cornmeal batter added a bit of crunch, and the bacon bits shined through with a hint of savoriness. Dousing the waffle in maple syrup and butter was optional.\n\nWe had New Orleans style powdered sugar beignets and fried okra as starters to nibble on prior to our chicken and waffles. The beignets were crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, and sprinkled generously with powdered sugar that after taking a bite, you'll have a fluffy white mustache. The fried okra was decent, the batter crunchy and not too thick. On the side was jalape\u00f1o aioli, which was not spicy at all. But if you love a bit of spicy, give their homemade hot sauce a try. The spicy, vinegary sauce packs a punch, without a lingering burning sensation.\n\nProbably the best fried chicken I've eaten is from The Screen Door in Portland, Oregon. Pair their fried chicken breast with The Front Porch's cornmeal bacon waffle and we've got the perfect combination I'd be willing to wait in a 30+ minute line to eat!", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Collard greens and mashed potatoes with it were okay. Also came with a side of popcorn that was sort of drenched in the fried chicken oil..... not sure what the popcorn's purpose was\n- Fried pickles ($7): I don't even like pickles but these were pretty good. Tabasco aioli was tasty! Portion size was a small bowl for $7\n- Dr. Pepper braised short ribs ($25): Probably my favorite entree--the beef was really tender and it went well with the mashed potatoes!\n- Spicy shrimp and grits ($24): Needed a bigger portion of grits... Wasn't spicy either. Shrimp was good though, and I liked the andouille sausage\n- Baked mac and cheese ($7.50): Yummy!!! Came on a hot plate and was ooey, gooey, and cheeeezy\n\nOverall the prices were a little higher than usual.

The fried okra was to be honest disappointing - now don't get me wrong I LOVE okra in all forms (that's the south asian in me) but here it was a bit too dry and the batter it was fried in was pretty bland. The bread pudding I think was legit a dessert and I'm not really sure why we went for it as an app (but that's the \"fun\" of hangovers I suppose). Too sweet for my taste, though I do remember really loving it in the moment, but I don't think I would order again. Basically the food is pretty fucking great, but it was SO damn dark inside that you could barely see what you were eating - okay I know I sound dramatic, but it's that dark inside.

Overall, the food was generally okay, so not writing about that.\n\nHowever, the hostess needs training. We arrived prior to them opening. There were 2 parties ahead of us who had checked in, our party (we checked in), and 1 after us who did not check in. We all waited outside. Then, another party arrived and went to the door. The hostess was seated at the bar - did not stand up to greet them. After greetings were exchanged, she immediately sat their party, leaving the rest of us standing outside to fend for ourselves.\n\nThen, that party, the 2 ahead of us and the 1 behind us were seated in the front part of the restaurant. However, we were seated at the back near the kitchen - the only ones back there with plenty of tables near the front. Since we were the only African-American party, something just didn't feel right. Therefore, I asked if we could move. Our waiter was very accommodating.\n\nLater, a party of 5 people came in. At that point, the restaurant was pretty full. The hostess squeezed them into the table we vacated rather than asking them to wait. You could tell it was very uncomfortable, especially since it was a table for 4. What took the cake was her comment, \"I'm sorry about this but someone asked to be moved (condescendingly) and this is all we have.\" She wasn't tactful in the volume or inflection of her comment.

The only thing I would change is that I wish we got more than FIVE shrimp, that's right FIVE shrimp! The sausage was nothing special, but the grits and gravy was magical. The hints of shallots added greater depth in flavor. It was so flavorful that I wanted to lick the bowl. It wasn't very spicy, but when I added the mild hot sauce it was so good. I mean SOOOO GOOD!\n\nThe fried chicken came about 15 minutes later. The mashed potatoes and collard greens isn't anything special.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-11-21", "description": "The food was great, service was great, everything was great. This would be a 5 star review if it hadn't ended up being $150 not including drinks, for only 3 people. \n\nThe Front Porch was really one of the better dining experiences I've had in San Francisco. We ordered a wide selection of food, which all represented a taste of New Orleans, or in general southern cuisine. With low ceilings and a richly decorated interior, and a cute illuminated outer seating area, The Front Porch is a hole-in-the-wall restaurant, or rather the bottom floor of a residential house that was converted into a restaurant. \n\nWe started off with Hush Puppies and Fried Pickles, both of which were excellent appetizers. The puppies were delicious crab meat fried wonders and were pretty large in size. It came with 4, plus dipping sauce, for $11, which is probably a little expensive for what it was. The fried pickles were a better value at $7 and were actually worth every penny, being wonderfully cooked and breaded with way more pickle than other attempts I've had. The ratio was perfect!\n\nWe then moved on to the entree. Two orders of the shrimp and grits and an order of the 4 piece fried chicken. The shrimp and grits were far better than the version I had in New Orleans itself, with perfectly cooked seafood, a spicy but juicy sausage, and incredibly prepared grits full of flavor. Those were 24 dollar dishes, and while it was delectable, I don't think it is worth quite that much. Maybe 19 or 20 dollars, max. I ordered the fried chicken, and it was hands down the best fried chicken I have ever tasted. First off, the plating and the sides were beautiful, with a wilted kale salad ordeal (delicious!) and a big old pile of mashed potatoes with gravy in the middle, volcano style. Then there were also little pieces of popcorn on the plate which was a nice touch and an even better snack, as they were seasoned! But back to the chicken. As moist and juicy as can be imagined, with a very crisp but not disproportionate breading. I can't even get over how good it was. And at 18.50, it was well worth the price, considering the size of the chicken and the amount I left for home with.\n\nAfter our entrees, we figured we would shoot par for the course and order dessert. The Sorbet of the Day was strawberry and it was definitely the best sorbet I've had, with little seeds in it, and flavor that could completely knock you back. Seriously, it would have been good to pair it with crackers or some other neutral flavor to tame the flavor a bit. So good, but at 6.50 for a bowl it probably wasn't worth half that. The second dessert was classic New Orleans beignets (pronounced benn-yays), a puffy pastry drenched in powdered sugar. Seemingly fresh out of the oven, these were incredible, and as good as the ones we got in Louisiana. Finally, the sundae was ordered, and it was perfect. Chocolate ice cream on top of a brownie, topped with whipped cream and chocolate syrup. Couldn't have been better, apart from the 8 dollar price. Yikes. \n\nAlso, Kenny, our server, was awesome. He chatted with us and told us about the hot sauces that were on the table and was in general quite helpful. \n\nWith all that in mind, it seems like a super great experience, and one that I would not hesitate to recommend. I can't wait to go back myself, so long as I can face the priciness of the place. Yes, it was good. However, I think I just feel bad when I pay that much for a single meal. I can't stress enough how good it was though! Highly recommend.", "author": "John B."}

They had some tables outside that looked like they would be nice to sit at. \n\nThey bring mini corn muffins with herb butter to the table instead of bread. Those were tasty. \n\nOne of our party was allergic to celery and our waitress was great about checking to make sure there was no celery\n\nOur party got:\nThe ahi tuna Wellington special. It was good. Tasted kinda like beef Wellington. Sauce and filo dough were tasty. \n\nThe fried chicken was excellent. Very crispy and the chicken was moist and flavorful but still cooked through. Might have been a little too salty for my liking. Still, 5 stars. \n\nThe shrimp gumbo polenta was a little bland. This could have been because we got the sauce on the side (it had celery) but when I added the sauce back it just didn't quite have that richness I wanted. \n\nThe beef short ribs looked good, but I didn't actually try them. \n\nWould like to try the jambalaya risotto. I saw it on another table and it looked good. \n\nOn the spendier side- easily 40 per person with a drink - and they have lots of special cocktails and a selection of beer and wine.", "author": "Sarah C."}

I felt that it was a little too sweet for my liking but it was decent.  \n\nFried chicken, 4 pieces:  3 stars.  The chicken was crispy and tender...but the sides were meh.  The collard greens were way too large and chewy.  No seasoning whatsoever.  Mashed potatoes?  Definitely not a highlight.  Also served with popcorn which was soggy.  I'd order a bucket of chicken and leave the sides behind instead.\n\nBurger with house made American:  5000 stars.  Wowza.  Now, that's what I call a burger!  The meat was cooked perfectly to my requested medium rare.  The cheese was absolutely ridonkulous and melted perfectly.  The fries were also the perfect balance between chewy and crispy.  Fantastic.\n\nOur bourbon and ginger was stiff.  Perfect on a warm, sunny day.  \n\nOur food took a very long to come out.  There was a huge gap between the appetizer and the main courses.  We're talking a sitting uncomfortably twiddling our thumbs kinda gap.  \n\nService was friendly though and we weren't ignored at the bar.

The service was fabulous. Very attentive and precise. Great personalities. Drinks were fabulous. I wanted everything. So we ordered, shrimp and grits, deviled eggs, baked mac and cheese, fried chicken 4 piece meal, and the short ribs dinner. I have 3 stars because the eggs literally had no taste to it, the fried chicken was overdone and the  garlic mash seemed old, and the short ribs had the look as if they'd been sitting out all day. Very dry on the outside but it was amazingly tender. It just lacked the look of freshness and the taste I was after was missing.

Nevertheless, the host welcomed me and gave me the option of a seat at the bar or outdoor seating under the heat lamp. After starting at the bar, I ultimately ended outdoors and oh..what a great experience!\n\nThe timing between courses was on point. To begin, they started with complimentary little corn muffins, which were just ok, but taken to the next level with some amazing Rosemary butter.\n\nI also started with one of the yummiest, most beautiful salads ever -- a fall arugula mix with Fuji apples, pomegranates, pecans and delicious persimmons, which added a great tasty element. It was topped with a nice light balsamic vinaigrette. Very good salad and definitely shareable.\n\nAnd as a show of their extreme southern hospitality to a visiting southern girl, the chef let me sample one of the best versions of fried okra I've ever tried. Instead of the little slices I'm used to, these were larger pieces and salted perfectly. The jalape\u00f1o dipping aioli was a perfect accompaniment.\n\nI'm also a sucker for trying out fried chicken and Front Porch didn't disappoint. It was fried very well and reminded me of the cast iron fried chicken my grandmother used to fry. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10 because I tend to prefer a wet battered chicken recipe with just a tad more salt, but it was still very very good. The house made hot sauce completed it. They served four huge seasoned pieces with collard greens, popcorn ( this was different) and although it usually comes with garlic mashed potatoes, I subbed for the \"new\" moms twice baked potatoes with crispy potato skins. Definitely worth the $2 upgrade! \n\nI had the pleasure of visiting with two locals as they finished their drinks outside.

Be sure to make use of their homemade hot sauces (which they also sell for $8).\n\nDon't forget your sides or appetizers.  I feel their appetizers and sides are a bit inconsistent.  Sometimes they're amazing, sometimes they fall short.  The bf loves the crawfish hushpuppies ($9, 4 pieces) here.  Once the crawfish was a nice creamy filling inside the cornmeal ball which I loved, another time it was mixed in which made it dry.  The mac and cheese is a hit or miss as well.  I've had where it was creamy, cheesy and cooked perfectly and then another time the dish was overcooked.  It's also a small portion for $8.  The mashed potatoes and gravy ($6.50) is good.  The mashed potatoes are pretty thick.  You might want to ask for extra gravy because they sometimes skimp on it.  If you're a fan of pickles, my bf loved the fried pickles. \n\nService is friendly.

It was easy to make a reservation through Yelp for a party of 3 for a Saturday lunch. \n\nStreet parking is easy and the staff is very friendly. \n\nI personally felt like the restaurant has a bit of a European feel to it. They have outdoor tables, but space is limited. Inside is really dark and gloomy. That's the only thing I didn't like. \n\nThe menu is pretty big. They have chicory coffee which I wanted to try but didn't get to. \n\nThey do have a good drinks menu as well. A small list of cocktails with champagne. \n\nHere's what we tried:\n\n1. Mimosa - pretty standard\n2. I can't remember the name of this cocktail with champagne and passion fruit but it has a long name with the word \"Adult\". It was good. Very tangy. \n3. Blueberry Cornbread - we had this as a starter and it is a bit sweet and a hint of salt too. Interesting item. Must try!\n4. Chicken and Waffle - 4 pieces of chicken. Must try!\n5. Josey's Vegan - this was a delicious entree. Very flavorful and filling. Must try! \n\nAll together, our total was $68 with tax and tip for the above items. \n\nHighly recommend trying it!", "author": "Hiral P."}

I thought the food was decent/good, but it wasn't mind blowing like all these reviews on Yelp. \n\nAmbiance: I thought the outside was pretty cute and unique. I want to say the restaurant is like literally in a basement of a house/apartment. The lighting on the inside was a little dark so it was kind of hard to read the menu but i didn't mind. \n\nService: I thought my server was nice. Not super attentive but enough for me. \n\nFood: \nHush puppies: 4 small pieces for $8. Nothing special. \nMac n cheese: I would have to say the mac n cheese was pretty good. Just the right amount of cheese to pasta ratio. \nCreamed corn: it was okay but again nothing special.\nFried chicken: don't know if it was an off day tonight but I was pretty disappointed! There was too much batter and it was pretty salty. I'm a fried chicken connoisseur and I was really looking forward to this dish. Sadly it fell way below my expectations. \nShrimp and Grits: I thought this was a nice dish. The shrimp had a lot of taste. The grits were okay. The andouille sausage adds in a nice flavor though. \nBeignets: fried dough with sugar! What can go wrong?\nBourbon pecan pie: portion was so small for $8. It was good but I would pass if I were to go eat there again. I do have to say the 'whupped' cream was pretty darn tasty. \n\nOverall considering the price and taste of the food, I probably would not go back in the near future.", "author": "Vickiiieee V."}

It is southern comfort food! Myself and a group of friends end up coming without any reservation mind you(you need a reservation!) \n\nThe place on the inside is small dimly lit and almost Western spooky.

She is very nice, letting us know because we didn't come with the reservation the table that was available had to be emptied had a certain time.

Far as food I do remember that we ordered some delicious sliders, some okra, greens, macaroni and cheese, and a bucket of fried chicken so that four of us can split. \n\nThe Fried Chicken was delicious! The pieces that they gave were juicy its chicken was crispy. This itself cannot go without an order of grits, to complete the meal. \n\nThe place has a delicious sauce that you can also buy and take home, but while you're at it make sure you enjoy some of that delicious mini corn bread.\n\nThis isn't the last time you've seen me!

I don't mean to say the food was bad...I just wanted the beignets way, way, way more than anything else that was on my plate. I got the chicken fried steak, which was not what I was expecting.

Living in the East Bay, we're making an effort to try out neighborhood restaurants in San Francisco. Being fans of Cajun/Creole, we decided to try the Front Porch. \n\nWe were greeted and given several seating options. We liked the hipster vibe of the restaurant. Upon being seated, we were presented with a pair of very small Corn Muffins. How small? Two bites each. \n\nThe menu is pretty basic. Everything short of dessert fits on one page. I asked if the size of the Gumbo (appetizer) was appropriate for sharing. I was told that if I ordered the Dr. Pepper Beef Short Rib and she ordered the Fried Chicken Dinner, that the Gumbo would fill us up just fine, as the Gumbo came in a medium sized bowl. \n\nThe gumbo was served with three bottles of hot sauce. A mild, a medium and a spicy habanero. The mild was bland. The medium had a nice little kick to it. We didn't dare try the habanero. The gumbo itself was very bland and needed the hot sauce. \n\nMy Beef Short Rib was boneless and sitting on top of a pile of Smashed Potatoes. There was also some Broccolini keeping the Short Rib company. Flavorwise, it was good. Portionwise, it was adequate. Tenderwise, the fat was cooked out so the meat was a tad drier than I would have preferred. I didn't realize until after the meal was over that I hadn't received any horseradish (or if I had, it had no heat!).\n\nThe Fried Chicken was flavorful. The Garlic Mashed Potatoes were good but needed a bit more gravy as she ran out before finishing the potatoes. The Ham Hock Collard Greens were tender but lacked any smoky flavor.\n\nAll in all, an okay restaurant with very good service but not enough bang for the buck to bring us back.", "author": "Dexter D."}

Made a reservation for an 11 AM brunch on Saturday and the place was surprisingly only half full. Yay. Ordered the Stoner Stack ($13) and omg, as the boyfriend can attest, I still talk about that sandwich months later. The combination of fried chicken, bacon, cheese, and sausage gravy together on a biscuit is just too much, in the best way possible. It was so good that I don't remember what anyone else ordered... the Hangover Helper? Eggs Benedict? Also on the plus side, the sandwich is really filling, especially since there's also a side of potatoes or grits. I got box to go, but if you're manly enough, you can definitely devour it.\n\nService: Not bad for brunch but it does take a while and then some for the food to come out. ~25 mins after ordering? But our waitress was nice and since we were all happy with the order, we didn't need to ask her for much.\n\nAmbiance: Boyfriend lives around the corner, so I can't comment much on the parking.

Street parking which seemed like it'd be difficult at times (but in San Francisco, what can you really expect). \n\nTwo complimentary sweet corn bread muffins with an herb butter. They weren't hot (not sure if they should be?) but they were still very tasty. Small like mini muffins... We asked for two more and that wasn't a problem.\n\nFried green tomatoes were tasty. Three slices topped with a pimento sauce were good. Not a huge portion or anything. \n\nMac and cheese was quite delicious! It came out in a small skillet. Creamy shells and good flavors; not bland like some can be. It was probably my favorite part of the meal. \n\nWe came for the fried chicken though, and it wasn't our favorite. The skin was kind of chewy/soft in spots, and the meat had a very plain-chicken taste... And almost bitter in a way. It was juicy though. It was difficult to bite into a clean spot though, also. So the chicken was probably my husband and my least favorite part, unfortunately. Everything else was delicious though, and the service was good. Collard greens are fair but a bit tough; good flavor though. Mashed potatoes were tasty. Biscuits came with an herb butter and apricot jam, which was very good. Everything was hot and good sized portions.... Neither of us could touch the 4th piece of chicken. \n\nCokes were by-the-can, so I doubt the refills were free. \n\nWe'd probably go back, but try something other than the fried chicken.

We had tried to move our food away hoping the bee would leave. It did not.

After hearing this, I was in disbelief and anger as my intention and expectation as a customer was only to be provided with a safe environment to consume my meal.

The menu was unique and if I hadn't seen the t-shirt, I would of gotten something else, but I was happy that I went with the chicken.\n\nAs itself, the meat was juicy and not dry. My guess is that it is brined and then battered/fried, and it makes a world of a difference. The fried batter was good with flavor. This ain't your kentucky fried chicken mess. This has unique spices that go well all around and the crisp is dark in color and not light. The hock hammed collared greens were the first I've ever enjoyed collared greens. It was soft and solid with a little tang but not too over powering. The mashed potatoes were creamy and could totally be used on the chicken to become biscuit and gravyish.\n\nI definitely would recommend sharing majority of the entrees unless you can eat a lot. The 4 piece fried chicken were good enough for 2 people.\n\nThe vibe is like you walked into a home with the porch outside. Totally unique, small, comfy, and fits the neighborhood well.

Our reservation was for nine o'clock and while we were on time we ended up being plus one, upon arrival. Probably not a big deal, but this is a small place; only worth mentioning because it resulted in a lengthy wait outside (probably to the tune of 30-45 minutes). They tried to make it right, with a free app, and bringing us drinks; the app however was slightly different (boiled peanuts) drinks were basically okay, sans the wine, which had turned (tasting of vinegar). They promptly replaced the wine with an appropriate substitution that was on par. \n\nIn any event, we were eventually seated and this place was busy! I mentioned it was late but still it was loud (at this hour on a weekday I believe that's a testament to a well enjoyed restaurant). It is also a bit eclectic and bohemian but definitely in line with the City and what I've come to expect (in a good way). In any event let me close this portion by saying they were all very polite, eager to please, and happy to go the extra mile in homage to their customers. \n\nI ordered the spicy shrimp and grits. First bite, grits, buttery, decadent, perfect consistency, almost mashed potato like and oh so savory. It came with a sauce that was very complimentary and offered incredible layers of appeal. The spicy was absent but that is typical for me, that said the sausage offered significant flavor to the dish and the shrimp was perfectly cooked. They served a bread snack small muffin, as a warmup, but it was a little disjointed for me; not as sweet as cornbread and tasted of sourdough without that consistency. The spread offered with the bread was okay, but did little to enhance the flavor of the bread, or stand on its own. \n\nAs for our other diners and guests: our younger son had the Dr. Pepper ham, which I didn't taste, but those that did raved. Our elder son, had the burger (he was polite enough to accept it, he'd ordered the flank steak but it became confused somehow) he ate 3/4 of it and was done; he also ate three fries and was equally over the fries too. My wife is a lover of mac 'n cheese and yet most of it remained in her dish; she described it as simply a cheddar sauce and a lot dry. I'd have went with a creamier cheese; though I love cheddar, it doesn't typically make a great sauce as it gets grainy when melting. \n\nHey, we often joke I do better at ordering, so perhaps I should've ordered for my lovely wife. Overall, I was happy with the dining experience, but I think she had the lesser experience, as did the elder son. I'd still come back, especially were I local.\n\nOn a brief side note: we could've easily passed by this place and missed it so know the address or destination, but it's worth the trip.", "author": "Drew R."}

Once there we were greeted by a friendly and smiling hostess and our table was ready in five minutes, much better than the 45 minutes they were quoting walk-in guests. \n\nThere were three in our party and we were seated in the five minutes range. Water was quickly poured and menus handed out. They offer a nice variety of brunch and lunch items as well as some interesting cocktails. We stuck with lemonade and iced tea however. I asked for a piece of lemon for the tea and they brought us a cup full of lemon wedges right away. \n\nOne of us ordered Shrimp and Grits with Andouille Sausage Gravy. The dish comes steaming hot with creamy grits, four tender jumbo shrimp and a good portion of andouille sausage in the gravy, which has a pleasant level of heat. If you want it hotter you can always add their house hot sauce. \n\nAlso ordered was the Vegan Breakfast a mix of vegetable with crispy grit sticks. It's a generous portion and our friend really enjoyed it. \n\nI think I ordered the best breakfast dish:  Baked Egg and Grits with Spinach, Mushrooms, Goat Cheese and Bacon Crack. This arrives in an individual cast iron pan. Be careful, it's really hot. The sunny side egg sits atop creamy Grits that are enriched with the goat cheese and hide the morsels of mushrooms and Spinach. The caramelized, slightly sweet bacon is scattered on top of the dish. Each spoonful is different, depending on what combination of the ingredients you get, but each mouthful is pure comfort food. \n\nThe service and food are terrific. The restaurant has a very high noise level making it harder to hold a conversation, but it's ok to just silently commune with such delicious food.

The collards were good, tangy, tasty.  The supposedly \"garlic\" mashers were just mashed potatoes no garlic flavor at all.  The popcorn was fine, but I wanted food, not popcorn..\n\nFish fingers with fries: This should have been an easy home run, but the fish fingers smelled \"fishy\" & not in a good way.  The fries were good, but the fish fingers were not, only half of one fish finger was eaten.\n\nShrimp with grits & andouille sausage: This was the most flavorful dish at our table, but it was very overpriced at $22.00.\n\nMy group felt that food was very bland, not flavorful at all.  In addition to the food not being very good the prices were VERY high......For people who have milder pallets & a lot of money to burn this would work, but I really need flavor in my food and maybe even a little kick since it's supposed to be Cajun...

I'm just not feeling their food or their vibe.\n\nA few months ago, I had a piece of their fried chicken, fresh out of the fryer, and really enjoyed it.  It had perhaps a few too many herbs and such that weren't necessary, but the chicken was juicy and the batter was well-salted.  So, when we were looking for a brunch spot that offered chicken & waffles and biscuits & gravy, The Front Porch came to mind.\n\nI grew up in New Orleans, so I was excited to see some of my favorite foods on the menu - gumbo, red beans and rice, and even poboys using Gambino's French bread!  For two of us, we ordered biscuits and gravy, red beans and rice with sausage, and file gumbo as starters.  We then ordered chicken and waffles and a fried shrimp poboy as our main course.  A lot of food - way too much for two people - but I wanted to try it all.\n\nWe got the read beans and the gumbo very quickly...though it took us much longer, like halfway through our meal, to get water (we had to ask three times).  The red beans were awful.  Gummy and thick, sort of sweet and tomato-y....they tasted like old baked beans over rice.  The ratio of beans to rice was also way off.  There was much too much rice...  The gumbo was lukewarm and flavorless.  It needed a LOT more salt.  The meat was mealy and overcooked - plus, there was hardly any of it.  The okra was also overcooked and slimy.  I generally don't understand putting okra in a chicken/sausage gumbo...  The biscuits and gravy - arguably the fastest item to slap together - did not come out.\n\nNext, my poboy arrived - not with my boyfriend's meal as we had requested.  The bread would have been good if not stale.  There was little to no remoulade. The shrimp were fried using the same batter as the chicken, which has too many herbs that just aren't thematically appropriate.  Plus, the batter is too thick and overwhelming for shrimp.\n\nThe chicken and waffles came out next.  Still no biscuits and gravy...  The chicken was very disappointing relative to my first experience.  It had hardly any flavor.  The quality of the chicken was still good, but it was just so meh tasting.\n\nThe biscuits and gravy finally arrived - last.  They were TERRIBLE.  The Front Porch biscuits are actually scones.  They are so hard and dense, you nearly need a knife to cut through them.  They're basically the type of \"biscuits\" that colonial settlers used to carry with them on journeys from England to the \"New World\" because they were rock-like enough to stand up to seawater for months...  The gravy tasted awful.  It didn't have any sausage in it, it was very under-salted, and it had this weird acidic flavor.  We couldn't place it - but this was not biscuit gravy.\n\nAcross the board, everything was bland and under-seasoned.  To make matters worse, the service is scatterbrained and the restaurant is oppressively dark and gloomy.  I won't be returning...", "author": "Tay H."}

Literally when I walked through the door, I was greeted, seated, and served as a family guest! Kevin, Kenny, Mundo, and of course Xtina, the most gracious hostess in town. I have no filter for patronizing but that is not what you are going to get here. You are going to get a family of staff who care more about you hearing your table conversation clearly on Thirsty Thursdays instead of being sat in a preset spot. This was amazing! Memorable moments with the staff are just the introduction. The food! Wow. Ok so this Thursday they had one of the newest featured U.S. manufactured gins' (Blue Coat Gin) on special in three different ways. Mine featured an amazing pineapple slush along with a lovely edible flowers. Then I was pleasantly surprised by a veggie burger on the menu, along with many vegetarian options for the menu staples! Also, no request is ever denied, only configured to work for you, MY FAVORITE PHRASE IN THE CULINARY WORLD. First out vegan red beans & rice... hands down best I've had, and yes I used to live in the south. Next the veggie burger, Cajun fries, baked Mac were enough to set up the night! The seasoning makes up for any meat withdrawals you may have from the veggie options. That is amazing cooking. My party had the famous fried chicken with garlic mash, veggie collards, and of course the ever so clever kettle corn that resembled an improved version of chicken & waffles. Lastly, cast-iron upside down cake completed a perfect night. Cheers to my favorite pub and *publican in South Mission!

Yum.  Could have used a little more salt too, but by no means was it bland.\n\nBeans and rice, with meat: Yes, you can order beans and rice vegan, or you can add sausage (+$2).  And when you add sausage, they are generous with that andouille sausage!  The rice and beans have so much flavor you don't even need the meat.  This was a great dish.\n\nHam Hock collard greens: I wish I could have passed on this. It was really soggy and vinegar-y.  Didn't have a rich meaty flavor either.  Honestly, it didn't taste like any meat was cooked with it and it tasted like they just doused it with vinegar.\n\nShrimp and grits: tasty dish, big portion!\n\nBourbon pecan pie: this is a sweet tooth heaven.  It's sweet sweet sweet sweet.  I got it with ice cream instead of whipped cream and it needed the ice cream to cut the sweetness. If you like sweet pecan pie, get this!

Just a block off of Mission, the Front Porch has a divey feel to it. When we walked up, a few people were sitting on the rocking chairs outside and we had a quick wait before getting seated. There's little natural light inside leaving it kind of dark and the environment feels more suitable for dinner or a bar. \n\nWhile a lot of people seemed to order the fried chicken, the bf wasn't in the mood so we got the sweet potato pull pork hash, hangover helper, and file gumbo.

The bf scarfed it down but ultimately declared it wasn't as good as the gumbo at the Boiling Crab. When I tried it, it did seem less flavorful. Then, the entrees came and I was tad disappointed. The Hangover Helper just looked like mac n' cheese with an egg placed on top. The \"spicy beef chili\" was pretty much nonexistent. I imagined chunky chili mixed into the mac, but it was more like little flecks stirred into the cheese. Despite that, it was pretty decent mac n' cheese and the overall flavor was still pretty solid. Just don't advertise chili if there isn't going to be any! (check out the photo). As for the sweet potato hash, I thought it would be a nice sweet and savory mix that can really work in brunch meals. Unfortunately, that's not what the dish delivered. The sweet potatoes didn't even taste like sweet potatoes and the pull pork was a tad dry - probably needed to be fattier meat. \n\nOverall, the food was okay but not great.

I'm not 100% sure the garlic butter was an optimal match with the cornbread. There was definitely a fistful of garlic mixed in, so get your kiss before spreading. \n\nLet me tell you though, the crawfish hushpuppies are spectacular! Big chunks of crawfish steaming inside of a crispy ball with a moist, soft, juicy inside. The aioli spread was perfect to swipe the last bite! \n\nOn a little vent here, but hey folks, please delete that vegan Gumbo!!! That's just disrespectful, plain and simple. That's like telling someone you're going to make apple pie, but use potato's with apple flavoring. It's totally not the same. Gumbo is NOT gumbo without the shrimp, crab and sausage. PERIOD! Clearly I didn't order the gumbo.\n\nI did order the Fried Chicken and Shrimp & Grits. The chicken takes a while to come out when ordered, so you know it hasn't been sitting under a heat lamp. When it does come be ready because whoa nelly! I burned my lip it was so hot! Crispy and moist the way fried chicken is meant to be. It's definitely not oily or over salted. The side of greens were alright - they tasted a little sweet for my liking. Popcorn was a fun touch to the plate. \n\nThe fragrance from the roux from the shrimp & grits made my mouth water before it event hit the table. The bowl is filled with slices of garlic, chives, shrimp and andouille. They were a bit skimpy on the shrimp, 5 altogether and Trader Joe's makes a better andouille sausage. The grits were creamy, buttery and absorbed the roux marvelously. I would like to know where they get their grits from because they were excellent! \n\nThe tables have real flowers on them and the music level is at a nice volume, so you can actually hear the person speaking across from you. Staff was friendly and warm, though not overbearing. When we were leaving we had some pieces of the chicken left to go, so they added a few more pieces in our go box. Creole treat?\n\nThe menu is limited and I do believe they run out of items on occasion. There was one on this night but I can't remember what it was. Still, a limited menu means they specialize in those particular dishes. So you know what to expect whenever you go. Will be back to sample more of their dishes soon.", "author": "Jaylena P."}

Reserving this restaurant on Yelp was a synch! \n\nWe got there on a Saturday evening at 6:15p for our 6:30p reservations. We found it easy to find but I do recommend to come early to find parking as its not easy. It's all street parking and small parking areas. You should not bring a big car to the city anyway. Coming to the place it was a regular SF home that had a basement or tandem garage at the bottom of the house that got decorated. Nice idea. The restaurant is literally the whole basement garage floor. Inside was nicely decorated but small and tight. This is not for large crowds. We were five of us and our buddy had to sit at the end with a chair but the servers had to go around him. Many of the tables were booth like seatings. They do have a small bar area but not really comfortable to eat there. They have a few tables outside with ceiling heaters if you like to be outside? The ambiance is casual. It's very dark inside and loud. I had such a hard time to taking pictures! ;p\n\nThere front hostess was cool. Our server was ok, too... Lol She looked like a lady wrestler with a very short t-shirt that doesn't seem to fit. \n\nThe menu was a full a page and drinks on the other and it was not a large selection. I was a little disappointed like my friends that came with me! I have heard about this place and have been wanting to go since we went to New Orleans. I had to check if the food was the same. We ordered the below:\n\nDrinks:\nChocolate enojado - was good\nBeers\n\nAppetizers:\n1)Deviled eggs with bacon-bourbon jam - ok but needs more flavor. I can make it better than this?!\n2)Fried okra with jalape\u00f1o aioli - was very good\n3)Crawfish hush puppies - all bread and barely any crawfish like the pictures I saw on Yelp. What happened?\n4) boiled peanuts - ok\n\nMeal:\n1)Bucket of fried chicken - bucket of 10 pcs was ok size; not big at all. Had a lot of coating but pretty juicy; not worth $29. This came with sides and we got two: \n2)Mac n cheese and - very good\n3) Ham hock collards - ok\n4)Spicy shrimp & grits - was ok and not even spicy at all. I had to add their hot sauce to make the whole dish taste better! The shrimp was big and juicy thou...I had this in New Orleans and was not even close to it. \n5)Pan fried wild flounder - My friend let me try it and said it was pretty good but to me, the fish was cooked well and the jambalaya at the bottom was only ok; not spicy or flavorful. It did have some fresh greens in it.\n6) Gumbo - it was dark but pretty good. I wish the sausages were spicy.\n\nStars is under three stars. All in all with ok service on a busy night and food. I will say ok place but I don't think I would come back unless someone paid for me! ;-p No wow factor for me! Sorry.", "author": "Edna G."}

It was in the back next to the restrooms with people on either side of us. All I could here were there conversations. And the food was horrible. I got the chicken and waffles. The waffle tasted like Jiffy cornbread and the chicken was bland and slightly undercooked. Then I got sweet tea, which wasn't sweet at all. When I asked the waitress to take it and just bring me I've for the water, she didn't. She brought me ice and more simple syrup for the tea that I answered several times that I did not want. Of course I was still charged for it even though I never drank it. My friend ordered chicken fried steak that was overcooked. He said the mimosas were good, so that's the only thing that this place gets a star for. I, on the other hand paid 31 dollars for cornbread and water. It was 31 because they couldn't split the check by item so I just did half to make it east.  I basically sent my whole plate back and asked for the check. Waitress didn't even make sure we liked the food, which we clearly didn't. I didn't even want anything to go. Definitely don't see what all the hype is about.

Everyone knows that The Front Porch's fried chicken is their staple. It's 4 pieces of hot, perfectly breaded, juicy chicken accompanied by huge sides of ham hock collards and mash & gravy. For $19, it's a huge entree for two. This bad boy takes about 25 minutes to make and fry, so order a couple of sides while you wait. Off the menu, you can also order creole fries (hot, russet potatoes with skin), so get those. You definitely want the baked mac for $8.

This place is pretty small so I would recommend you make a reservation if you wanted to try it.\n\nBetween the 6 of us we ordered (3) chicken and waffles (they advised they require 25 minute to prepare this dish), (2) shrimp and grits, (1) stoner stack, (1) fried okra, and (2) baked mac and cheese.\n\nThe okra was a pretty good side and I really liked their baked mac and cheese.\n\nI found their shrimp and grits (also with andouille sausage) to be delicious.

I promptly made a reservation through Yelp, and requested that we be seated outside, fully knowing that they might not be able to fulfill that request.\n\nThey sat us right away at the next available table, which was inside all the way in the back.  It was really hot back there, and dark.. My mom, who doesn't do well with heat, was feeling stuffy.  And we smelled like food when we left.\n\nThough service was good throughout, my dad did not appreciate our server taking orders from the table next to us.  The couple came after we sat down, and yet their order was taken first.  My dad who, through many years of traveling around the world, has experienced discrimination, and is sensitive when these things happen.  I'm not sure why our order wasn't taken first, and though I'm absolutely do not believe it's racially motivated, it put a damper on our dining experience.\n\nAs far as the brunch, it was okay.  It wasn't bad, and it wasn't off-the-charts fantastic.  I ordered the Stoner Stack, which had fried chicken, cheddar, bacon, and sausage gravy on a biscuit.  And for extra, I ordered it with a fried egg.  It was heavy and one-noted.  Nothing in the Stoner Stack stood out in flavor.  I think if it came with a slaw, it would add some freshness to this heavy sandwich.  I ordered this with potatoes, which was a mistake because it just added more weight.  I wish I ordered the grits, especially since this is a Southern restaurant.  Rookie mistake which I will not repeat.  The beignets were okay too.  I'm not expecting the ones I devoured in New Orleans, but they didn't come close either.\n\nOur 3-star experience didn't deter us from our decision to come again.  We want to try their dinner menu, and hopefully will have a better experience.", "author": "Vira P."}

Brunch here is really good. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the fried okra w/ the jalapeno aioli as an appetizer and it was fried to perfection and well seasoned. Also, We ordered the Stoner breakfast sandwich with grits and it was soooo good. The stoner sandwich comes with bacon, cheese, and fried chicken inside a warm and toasted biscuit. You can add egg, which I did and it was delightful. With just a few bites, I had contracted the itis, but that also be due to the fact that I practically downed my OJ and had an appetizer.

Everything was good. Was it the best southern food I have had? No, maybe not. But it's a great option if you'd rather not go south of the Mason-Dixon Line.

We were not even late. CHILL please! It was raining that day too and luckily the rain stopped when we were waiting outside. \n\nThe restaurant itself is very dimmed and loud. The server greeted us with a smile but kind of sense she have a bit of a attitude. We are a group of 10 girls but when she was taking our order she didn't write anything down. We are like dam she is pretty good but she ended messing up our order a bit. She double order some of the sides and gave us less for some we wanted 2 of. Didn't send it back because we were hungry. But I feel like she should have wrote the orders down if its a big party. \n\nWe ordered a lot of food. FYI Free corn bread. Started with 2 SALADS. One salad we asked for the goat cheese on the side but I think she forgot. It's okay with me but the friends who doesn't like goat cheese didn't eat it. \nFor starters we got: \nGUMBO with chicken - I thought it was pretty good, not too salty with lots of flavor. Not waterly.\nBlue crab HUSH PUPPIES - Was on the dryer side. \nFRIED PICKLES - It was huge pieces. Don't think it suppose to be like that and way too oily. Even from pictures on yelp, it's not suppose to be big chucks. Sliced is the normal way. \nFRIED OKRA - Pretty good. Couldn't really taste the slimy texture. \nspicy SHRIMP & GRITS - my favorite dish of the night. just enough flavor. \nWe also got a appetizer that has fritos chips and ground meat. That was really good but I forgot the name of that dish. \nbucket o' CHICKEN 10 piece - my friends love it. Most of them wanted seconds. Thinking its not salty and its moist. \nBriased SHORT RIBS - It was really dry. Server said it was suppose to melt in your mouth. With 10 girls, we had left overs from that dish. \nGarlic MASHers and gravy - Nothing special and not enough gravy. \nBaked MAC & CHESSE - This was so good. I think I had thirds. Everyone like this way more than the mash. Very cheesey. YUM!\nTWICE BAKED potatoes - Smooth. \n\nEnded the night with the new orleans style beignets with powdered sugar.

It looks kind of dingy - kind of like a bar - but with decorative touches. Like fake indoor windows and petite white shelves spotting the wall with potted plants on them. Also, Christmas just happened so they had haphazard stockings hanging from the ceilings. Overall, the decor was adorable in an off-center and whimsical way. I liked it.\n\nI ordered the fried okra and 4 piece fried chicken. I am going to be honest here: I'm biased because I don't like okra because I hate that slimy consistency. However, the fried-ness kind of helps to counterbalance that sliminess. The breading was really good and the jalapeno aioli was on point. Definitely has a kick to it if you're not a spicy person. \n\nFried chicken was bomb af. Personally liked it more than hard knox by a margin. I would definitely come here again.

Overall, the food is on the salty side and noticeably greasy and not particularly memorable or unique in comparison to other Southern restaurants. \n\n-JAMBALAYA - 4/5\nGood texture - soft/moist but not mushy - and pretty flavorful - not too tomato-y and has a little bit of heat.

Sausage was flavorful but the texture was kind of weird and crumbly. The grits were more creamy than gritty and kind of rich and buttery. I think I would've actually preferred the grits without the gravy. The gravy was flavorful but too salty and made the grits too creamy (like a puree). The shallots actually gave the grits a nice, slightly sweet, caramelized onion flavor that I enjoyed\n\n-FRIED CHICKEN - 3.5/5\nEh. The breast/white meat was very dry and flavorless. Drumsticks were a little juicier. The batter is pretty salty and incredibly greasy though. Yes, it's fried chicken but nicely fried chicken should have a crispness without the heavy oil\n\n-CRAWFISH HUSH PUPPIES - 1/5\nNot really sure what good hush puppies are actually like, but these were really dry on the inside, chewy on the outside and pretty spongy overall. I didn't taste anything crawfish about them and they had a slight sour/acidic taste to them", "author": "Jessie L."}

If it wasn't for the crazy rave reviews about the fried chicken (which was decent, don't get me wrong, just not 18 dollars good for four pieces!) and the shrimp and grits were just so so small, I'd actually be happier.\n\nI think that for the price that the place was charging, the portions needed to be bigger. And for the atmosphere, it was chill and we were on a date for date night but I def. didn't need my bf to shell out 70 dollars for 4 pieces of fried chicken, a small plate of grits with kinda mushy not fresh shrimp and then a small cup of mac and cheese... No thank you. Next time, we'll bring our money somewhere else for sure.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

I made a reservation without knowing anything about it (last minute Mother's Day thing) and at the end of the meal by whole fam were thanking me for researching and finding such a kick ass place.   So I totally scored.  Going on Mother's Day, the place was packed but they took us right back because we had reservations. The place is funky, hipster and loud.... And I'm not complaining about any of that.  It is such a fun place.  We got seated in a booth which was made out of old car seats, seatbelt included.  Directly behind me was an old school payphone (no dial tone, I checked lol).  As a vegan, I ordered the Josey's vegan that had grit fries.  I really had no idea what that was but I went for it.  And boy was I happy I did.  Grit fries maybe my new fav thing.  It's just fried grits, hard on the outside and smooth n gritty on the inside.   Only thing better would be if I had grits to dip my grit fries in. Haha. Grits on grits.  My meat eater fam got the actual grits and omg they looked amazing.  Greasy, garlicky and cheesy.  I had a little vegan envy of them. And that's why this place isn't getting 5 stars.  I wished they had more vegan options.  Like some fried tofu or vegan grits would be amazing.   Like a small sampling of what Souley Vegan has?   Either way, the food was amazing.

I wanted to be in love with you FP. I tried so hard. But from the start when I ordered chicory (my fam is from Louisiana, I know chicory) and when I asked the waitress why she brought me coffee instead of chicory she says \"Oh it's in there. Each batch might taste different with stronger and weaker brews.\" (Is this code for we use the same filter at least two times before we change it?) Because she was right! My last just actually rated like tree bark-chicory!\n\nThen of course being of sound mind I ordered the one thing that they're supposed to cook amazingly with their hands tied behind their backs and aprons over their faces - the fried chicken and waffles. \"Well, sure no problem, but that chicken is going to take about 20 mins wouldn't you like something to start with while you're waiting?\"-cood my server.  I wanted to scream \"Why didn't you tell me that when I sat down?\" But no, I'm cool because I'm a cook also and I know that this is a cool upsell technique, so you know what? Let's try the red beans and rice as a starter! You can't go wrong with RB & R, they're virtually impossible to mess up.... unless you just open a can and warm them up and top then with white rice and sprinkle green onions on them, which is EXACTLY WHAT THEY FREAKING DID! \n\nAre you serious? Like, really?\nRed beans and rice is a dish that LITERALLY costs $7 to make! $.99 for the beans, $3 for a smoked hock or shank, & $4 for the rice! Put it in a freaking crock pot and walk away! You mean to tell me you're too trifling to crock pot cook some red beans and rice? I'm not talking grandma's cast iron pot with onions, bell pepper, and garlic ham hock and beans- just a friggin set it and forget it crock pot! Dry beans? I've never in the history of being a Cuban Creole had DRY \"SOUTHERN\" Red Beans and rice! You are just mean and evil at this point! I'm not exaggerating, (see the picture!). I looked at the waitress with contempt and pushed the bowl to the end of the table.\n\nThen came the chicken. The very dark. Bitter skinned chicken. You almost burned my fricken fried chicken! What in tarnation, the skin is supposed to be the culmination of everything that is good and juicy in this world and you ruined it for me, not just because it was so dark and bitter but because I am dearly afraid of sending food back to the kitchen. I don't want them upset- just leave it. But the waitress saw the same thing and says \"awwe, too bad... you want me to take it back?\" Noooo, so I can wait another 30 minutes? No, I'm good thanks.\n\nThe waffle is the best in town. That batter is the business! Cold or hot that was a bomb waffle!  Excellent waffle!  Music was bumpin'! Chicken was over browned and red beans and rice were DRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I want to go back so you can repair our relationship, I don't want to Yelp this way about you, can we start over?

Street Parking only. ***\n\nWait: I was lucky that I put in a reservation. Even with a reservation, we were not immediately seated. So if you can, please do make a reservation. Just call them or even make a reservation on Yelp. Or else, you're gonna have to wait. ***\n\nAmbiance: This place is EXTREMELY, EXTREMELY dark. It was so dark it was hard to distinguish our waitress from another waitress! I wonder what that place looks like with some lights. The Front Porch is also very, very loud. Its much better for a rowdy night out with friends. **1/2\n\nService: Very, very slow. I suggest asking the servers all your questions and getting all you want before they walk away. Because this place is so busy, once they walk away it might be awhile before you can wave them down again. **\n\nRestrooms: A single stall for males and a single stall for females. They were not my favorite, the locks didn't work and they used a latch instead. And that's fine. But, it sometimes looked like the restroom door was unlocked/open even though it was not. Very misleading. While waiting in line for the bathroom, I've seen multiple people try the door only to realize that it was locked and making the patron inside feel very uncomfortable. Furthermore, waiting in line for the bathroom was also awkward, because you wait very close to a table for 2.  **1/2\n\nPrice: Very expensive for the product you get. 3 people ended up being $85 total including drinks, so be prepared. Considering what I paid for and how much I paid, I probably won't come back. $30 for a bucket with 10 pieces of chicken...that's a little bit too much in my opinion.  **1/2\n\nFood:\n\nBucket of Chicken: Served with popcorn on top, that's interesting. It doesn't add very much to the flavor profile, but popcorn that tastes like fried chicken mmm yum! The chicken itself was good and flavorful, but it was a bit oily for my taste. I know, I know. ITS FRIED CHICKEN. But, even for fried chicken it seemed heavy with oil. It was so oily, three people could not even finish the 10 piece bucket. It was so heavy, one piece of chicken for each person would have been enough to get the flavor and still feel good after leaving. ***1/2\n\nMac & Cheese: Standard baked mac & cheese. I was not blown away, nothing extremely special. Just normal, decent mac & cheese. I could have gone without it. For most people who know they can this themselves, they usually don't because it takes a lot of time: to prep, to cook, to clean up. So they go out to a nice restaurant and buy it to appease their cravings for this delicious goodness. So if you're willing to pay the price, go ahead and get it. Its exactly what it is: mac & cheese. ***1/2\n\nFried Okra: Pretty good. Dip it in some hot sauce. Like the mac & cheese, its standard fare. No surprises here. ***1/2\n\nShrimp and Grits: Good, the shrimp was good. A decent number of shrimp on a good portion of food and But, it also seemed a little heavy. ***1/2\n\nSidenote: I wish I ordered less chicken. I know, we went to a Creole/Cajun/Southern restaurant, so I was anticipating fried, oily deliciousness! But, it still seemed too heavy. My stomach gurgled the entire night. So be prepared.\n\nOverall average: ~ 3 stars. The food is fine, but dealing with everything else made enjoying the food a little more difficult. I will probably try a couple other restaurants before coming back for round two. But, if you want good food and don't mind it being too dark. Go for Front Porch.  There was an outside seating area (which is cute and very appropriate considering the name) If you could eat out there, I think that would be a better idea.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I would definitely recommend you try this sauce if you can handle spicy food. \n\n She then gave us two EXTREMELY small corn bread; it looks like muffins, and it's ridiculous how tiny they were! They're cute, but I am disappointed in the size of the corn bread. Other than the size, the corn bread was moist and delicious; the whipped butter that accompanies it was light and delicious. \n\n- BLUE CRAB HUSH PUPPIES WITH SPICY REMOULADE ($11): after the corn breads were gone (which was an easy feat due to their size), we were given the blue crab hush puppies. Oh my gosh, they were so delicious! The order comes with 4. When I cut opened a hush puppy, I can smell the blue crab. The first bite I had was heavenly. It was perfectly crunchy on on the outside and soft inside. I will admit that the blue crab was not as strong as I would prefer, but it was still good. The spicy remoulade was not spicy, but it went well with the hush puppies.   \n\n- FRIED CHICKEN 4 PIECES ($18.50): we ordered two of this because the pictures of these looked so delicious, and I'm so glad we trusted the pictures! This entree comes with 4 pieces of fried chicken, collard greens, mashed potato, and some popcorn. The plating style was cute because it was like a cafeteria tray! Nostalgia alert! The POPCORN was out of place, and I'm pretty sure it was used as a decoration. The COLLARD GREENS were tangy, and it complimented well with the chicken and mashed potato. I would say that although the collard greens were tasty, I would NOT go out of my way to order this as a side (if it was offered as a side). The MASHED POTATO was divine! Oh my. It was so creamy. The ratio between the mashed potato and gravy was off as I would have preferred a bit more gravy. Now to the holy grail: the FRIED CHICKEN. The fried chicken was so crunchy and moist. I poked one of my pieces with a fork, and the meat almost fell off the bone. It was effortless to peel the chicken off of the bones. The best part of the fried chicken is that it is not oily at all. I love fried chicken, but it always comes out oily. However, that's not the case for this restaurant. I just love the fried chicken offered here! \n\nOther than parking, we had a great time at this restaurant. I would definitely order the hush puppies, but I would order the bucket of fried chicken that comes with 10 pieces ($29) because it was so good! I've never had such moist, non-oily fried chicken before. You should definitely try this place if you are a fried chicken lover!", "author": "Susan V."}

The group before us were quoted a 45 minute wait, so we were especially grateful they held our table and it put us in a good mood to start our meal.\n\nEverything we ate was tasty (boiled peanuts, deviled eggs, short ribs, bouillabaisse, pecan pie).

The first time was for a late dinner, around 8:45. We sat at the bar and ordered a bunch of deep-fried appetizers (because what's a vacation without deep-fried goodness?). We got fried pickles, fried okra, and crawfish hush puppies. Everything was friggin' delicious, especially the hush puppies! We also loved the variety of dips that came with the appetizers -- spicy remoulade with the hush puppies, tabasco aioli with the fried pickles, and jalapeno aioli with the fried okra. Later on, we got some mac and cheese and lemon cheesecake, which were less exciting than the other dishes. The bartender that night was a pleasure to chat with. We also ended up meeting and chatting with a few other people from the area who were sitting at the bar, and that's always fun.\n\nWe came back for brunch two days later before heading to the airport. We got there at around 10:15, and it was already 90% packed (they opened at 10). It was a very wet morning, so there was no outside seating. We sat at a regular table by the door. We started with some delicious beignets. I ordered the fried chicken and waffles, and my boyfriend got The Stoner Stack. I must say that this was probably the best fried chicken I have ever had outside of Asian fried chicken!

I was able to do it on yelp, and without having Open Table send me a nasty little message that there was nothing available at my chosen time.  Also, I detest wasting an otherwise beautiful day off (because all days off are beautiful) waiting around for a table with everyone else in San Francisco.  It makes me testy.  \n\nWe were sat promptly upon our arrival. Great.  We were likewise greeted promptly by a very nice server. Also great. Our drink order was promptly taken and delivered. Excellent. I had a mimosa and for him, a Bloody Mary.  Look, I don't really like Bloody Marys.  They are not my chosen drink, but this one was different - nice and spicy hot - perfect mix of vodka and tomato juice - just the thing one needs to get the morning going. I was also quite fond of the mimosa, refreshing, served in a big glass, nice and cold.  I ordered a coffee which arrived at my table in a \"I love my godfather\" mug that I was tempted to abscond with.  \n\nOkay. I ordered the Bourbon French Toast with a side of sausage, and for him, the Shrimp Po' Boy with a side of jalapeno aioli.  The Po' Boy and side of sausage came out almost immediately, and the runner brought 2 plates as though we were going to split it. Uh oh! I was sure that our server had forgotten my order, but she explained that the Po' Boy came out too fast, quickly brought me another mimosa on the house, and brought my French Toast out several minutes later.  She apologized, the host apologized, and then both of their moms called me and apologized.  I was surprised at how cool they were being about it all--and my boyfriend remarked that although that is the way mistakes should be handled, it is almost NEVER handled that way in San Francisco.  Usually when restaurants fuck up, they make you feel like it's your fault for ordering the wrong thing or whatever.  I certainly have no recollection of any establishment giving me any hooch on the house in the past as a result of their mistakes.  It definitely made my day, although I spent the rest of the afternoon napping as I was a little tipsy when I left. \n\nAnyway, the food was great and plentiful, and we certainly had a lot of fun.

It was quite crispy but the overall flavor was nothing out of the ordinary. The collard greens were tasty with a hint of sour which helped with the saltiness of the chicken. \n\nThe place had good service and we were seated promptly. The restaurant does do a good job recreating a southern ambience. Because it's so far out in the town, we probably would not come back unless we happen to be in the area. But it is good to know there is a spot for Southern food if the craving ever hits.", "author": "Jimmy D."}

We wanted to find a place that served good Southern food and refreshing drinks. Overall it was pretty good. I wouldn't necessarily call this authentic southern food however; our food was tasty.  I had the spicy shrimp and grits which was well seasoned. The grits could of been a little less watery in consistency but it wasn't all that bad. I heard the breakfast menu is far better than dinner. So I must go back and try breakfast out. It a nice spot and the atmosphere is nice so I would definitely come back again", "author": "Lila N."}

I am a native of the south so I came here expecting some authentic Southern cuisine but was greeted with a very hipster interpretation of my favorite dishes that really fell flat...I should have known by the menu that this place was too cool for school when I saw the fried pickles with Tabasco aioli, but the reviews were great AND they were featured on DD&D, so I figured, why the hell not?\n\nWe made reservations for 7:30 but got there about half an hour early on Sunday night and said we'd wait but the hostess was very nice and offered to seat us immediately if we wanted to sit outside, which we did. Our server promptly greeted us, but she absolutely zero personality and seemed to be very cold...definitely a sign for things to come. They had sweet tea, to my delight, which tasted awesome, and I decided to split a bucket of chicken, with mashers and biscuits. My other friend got a cheeseburger and fries.\n\nSo how'd it all taste? In short, I was not impressed. The bucket of fried chicken was served with chicken and popcorn...clever? Maybe the popcorn was just for show because it was STALE. As far as the chicken, it tasted like it was over marinated before it was fried and the batter has zero flavor, so all I could taste was the over marinated chicken which didn't taste good at all. The biscuits weren't burnt, but they were pretty darn close. They were very hard and just crumbled when you tried to eat them. I will say, though, that the jam that came with them was amazing. My friend who got the burger said it was nothing special but the fries were awful (undercooked and over flavored), and he was not impressed by the homemade ketchup. The star of the evening, foodwise? The mashers...yum! I originally asked for the without gravy but they put it on there anyways, which was no big deal, but they were sooooo good!\n\nAfter we were done, we had half of the chicken left...my friend and I were arguing over who didn't have to take it home with us...I won that battle.\n\nNeedless to say, I don't think I'll be back. The service wasn't great, the food wasn't great, and I'll stick with KFC if I want some good fried chicken in the future.", "author": "JD G."}

I mean 4-star review and praise for fried chicken all around? Looks like a sure bet!\n\nWell...first of all parking is a bitch. Especially on a weekend night, expect at bare minimum 15 min of circling around the block. Also, waits are long so if possible would definitely recommend a reservation. It took us almost an hour plus to get seated? I also wasn't told when our table was ready - I had to call the restaurant back to see if it was, no one called me. When we sat, I'm guessing peak hour had finished as there were multiple tables open.\n\nWe started with cocktails cause cocktails. About a whiskey ginger in, the appetizer we ordered came out - sausage cheese balls. Now that sure sounds folksy and down-homey. Guess what gang? Tastes like sausage. I mean...really nothing special there. Would certainly pass. Go to the Safeway across the street, about the same.\n\nMoving along, it took forever to get our mains because the kitchen screwed up. People that were seated after us, and whose orders were placed after us got their food before we did. And I mean...their food as in our order of fried chicken. As in the table ordered fried chicken and something else and the kitchen screwed the ticket/there was miscommunication with the waitstaff and they delivered our plate of fried chicken to them. \n\nWe only finally got our order because a lost server was walking around with a plate and I had to holler out \"Hey I think that's ours\". He then walked the plate to the back of the restaurant to the kitchen to double check and came back with that same plate in hand. BTW no apologies and nothing off our ticket. Also, to note the guy who delivered the food was not the same guy who took our order. The original guy disappeared. And no one checked back on us. Recalling this experience I've deducted a star from 3-to-2 as this night was pretty abysmal.\n\nBearing all of this, if the food was good it would be worth it unfortunately, the food here is nothing special. The fried chicken is not of the really snappy crispy crunchy skin variety but more so of like a thick cornmeal type batter. The collard greens were a bit too sweet for my tastes and needed to be cooked with more pig. The mashed potatoes, though i'm sure not boxed, was mashed to a point you couldn't tell a textual difference from if they were and frankly needed more salt and pepper. (PS. this craptacular 4-piece chicken dinner is 18 bucks. WTF.)\n\nCall it a fluke if you will but service was pretty crappy - in fact, I did not feel as if I was provided service at all. If you're a neighborhood resident I can possibly see why you would come here; say at an off-hour, if they had specials. As an out-of-towner; I can definitively say that this is not a destination restaurant. You should spend your time finding some other place to get into because I'm sure there are better fried chicken joints in SF - there has to be.", "author": "Mike Y."}

Comfort and fire...and some \u00a0\"laissez les bons temps rouler\"! However what we got was not what I was expecting. \n\nFirst, walking into the place is was seriously dark...dive-y looking. All eyes turned as my daughter and I waited for someone to seat us. This is clearly a locals joint with a somewhat Hipster-ish patronage.\n\nAnyway...the wait staff turned out to be super friendly...and when I mentioned it was our first visit there...our waitress quickly changed her demeanor and settled in to tell us everything about everything! Not for a second did I feel that nervous energy many wait staff get when having to spend extra time explaining the menu! \n\nSo, while I was very disappointed that there was no Etouffee or Jambalaya on the menu...we were told it does make an appearance from time to time as their menu changes frequently. Disappointment set aside,we took our waitress's suggestion of having the fried chicken and Dr Pepper braised short ribs.\n\nDid I mention I was hungry? I also spotted crawfish hush puppies on the appetizer list as well as deviled eggs with a bourbon jam. \n\nHere's the short of what could be a long drawn out foodie orgasm of excited gesticulation...\n\nCrawfish hush puppies...F#%king awesome. Made the 9.00 price for 4 suddenly seem a bargain.\n\nDeviled eggs...my daughter doesn't like eggs, hates them in fact...but she downed half the order after I insisted she at least try them. She took one bite and I expected her to make a face and tell me the rest were mine. Not the case...she bit into one...her eyes sparkled a bit and a half smile crossed her mouth. We almost asked for a second order...I will be heading back here simply to get these again!\n\nDr. Pepper Short Ribs...amazing, spoon tender, deliciousness squared. Served with very good mashed potatoes...and a sauce/gravy made from the short rib braising liquid. This also came with perfectly cooked broccolitini. Any restaurant that can actually put out flavorful and completely cooked through veg while maintaining its Al-dente texture...just means you've got chefs in the kitchen who really give a shiznit about putting out good food.\n\nLast...the Fried Chicken was great...we had to wait a bit for this order as its made scratch...which is something that automatically impresses the hell out of me because most restaurants as a rule won't do this because its a wait.  Anyway...if I had one complaint t it was the fried chicken...but wait!...as a complaint this really doesn't count. So, my complaint? The chicken was too crunchy! So, you're thinking burnt, right? Nope...the chicken was cooked to perfection...the coating was delicious, flavorful, crunchy skin, yet for me...just a bit too crunchy...but its purely a texture thing for me. I think 95% of people would have to say its perfect...but I'm telling you my one miniscule issue...which isn't an issue as I'd order their fried chicken again and again.\n\nI could have eaten myself sick, but fortunately...or unfortunately...the portions aren't crazy in either direction...meaning that it is so much food you have to take home leftovers...or those pansy ass French portions which mean a stop through a burger joint is happening immediately after leaving the restaurant. The portions were a good balance...which initially in my starving state made them seem small...not true at all.\n\nThis place has easily provided my most flavorful and satisfying meal I've ever had in San Francisco...\n\nTo all the staff and chefs...OH and even the bus staff...you guys and gals are awesome!

I have a strong appreciation for places that can make deep fried chicken breast taste like a thigh. Be careful when biting into these bad boys, cuz your tongue will get blasted by the piping hot juicy goodness that is their fried chicken. \n\nAlso on the menu for our night were the blue crab hush puppies (oh mai gah!), mac'n cheese (good, but not life changing), and mashed potatoes (suggestion to staff: please serve with more gravy!). I also ordered the porch swing (cocktail) and my fiancee ordered the old fashioned. The porch swing was a bit whatevers in my book, but we both agreed that their Dr. Pepper braised old fashioned is a must!

A local friend recommended this place for great fried chicken.

The andouille sausage had a good kick of spice and were tasty. The shrimp was cooked perfect!\n- Dr. Pepper Braised Short Ribs: These were good and I would say worth to try but I probably wouldn't order it again. It was a super rich dish, which is expected in southern cooking. This was my fiance's entree, but he seemed to enjoy eating my spicy shrimp and grits dish more ;)\n- Fried Chicken Plate: We thought it was amusing that this was served on a lunch cafeteria tray instead of a nice white plate like the other dishes. I tried a piece of the fried chicken and the batter was tasty and light surprisingly (it wasn't oily at all). The chicken was also super flavorful and moist. \n- Flounder: I'm not sure how this was but my friend seemed to enjoy it\n\nWe had to finish our meal with some good ole desserts.

They're also very flexible and would accommodate your timeline, say, if you were stuck in traffic and needed an extra 15 mins to get there.\n\nReally friendly waiters/ hosts.

Got to the Front Porch 30 minutes earlier than I had planned. Waited for fifteen while worked. Great setting in a very cool neighborhood, one which I had not revisited since the mid 90s.  Boy it had changed, a lot. Parking was still relatively easy which was why I chose Bernal Heights rather than the Mission in my recent eating expeditions. R lived on 15th and the Mission and he was easy as far as where to meet up, as long as there was vegan dishes on the menu. For years I had hosted large New Years eve parties and he'd bring his then girlfriend over for dinner. Three years ago when I remet him, he was once again single, and moved back to his condo in the Mission and experiencing a surge of renewed confidence: good looking educated smart men with a sense of style and kink, was apparently the winning ticket in the city. I was beginning a new chapter of my life as well and we started to hang out in varies parts of the city after long day of work to swap stories of the city. \n\nAlways fun to try new places. Always good to know where to get your fried okra fix without having to travel to the South. Always know no matter where you eat, vegan options in this part of the town is aplenty. Over dinner I learned that several girlfriends later, R remained single yet cautiously optimistic. He also learned there was no change in my life.  There was always going to be a group of people who were transients in my life, they enter and exit through a revolving door, within months I forget their names or my experiences with them, but the core group of people remained the same. Those who I guard and protect fiercely, those I would do anything to be with, those I remain faithful and loyal.\n\nI summarized the state of my being over fried chicken and collard greens. He chowed down his vegan dish while giving me his. We capped the evening with Mitchell's strawberry sorbet. \n\nThis is not a date restaurant.

You won't go wrong if you grab food at The Front Porch.", "author": "Sarah B."}

We heared a lot of good stuffs about this place before and that is why I decided to bring a good friend of mine to this place. We made a reservation and get seated right the way as we walked in.... After me and my friends finished up what should we order, we put the menu asidr, and waited for the waitress, we waited and waited, nobody came at all... Finally I saw one waitress came over to my table, and stopped at the table that next to us, and asked them how was everything for them. (Not even look up to us, and just walk pass through us)But after that, she just ignored me and my friend and standing in a corner look for if other customer needs help......We were sitting for 20 mins, no water, no service,So what the fuck?!! That is kind of service that I should deserve? Or because I am a Asian, they do not feel happy to take my order? I felt extremely uncomfortable, and just cannot stand for it. I told my friend we should just leave for another place to eat.... \n  I really do not care how amazing the food they were serving over there, they failed the customer service part...\nJust so pissed off\nI would never go back, I mean never.", "author": "Gloria Y."}

And they are out of order now. It was such an awesome vacation. But with next year vacation looming. It is time for me to knock these out. \n\nBut seriously, The Front Porch. You have to eat here. You just have to!\n\nThe Front Porch was discovered during my Food Network search for good places to eat while in San Francisco. Guy Fieri was a fan and this was the 2nd place during my trip that I visited that a food channel personality visited as well. However the 1st place was on accident. (Carmel, CA From Scratch Restaurant - Chef Robert Irvine and Guy Fieri was there) This place was research. \n\nI think we drove through 4 different neighborhoods on our way there. One thing about San Fran is that certain neighborhoods have a different appearance and vibe. \n\nFirst issue once we actually found the location (which is easy to miss because it is a house turned into a restaurant. And when I say house I am referring to the traditional San Francisco row house.) was trying to find a place to park. No matter what please avoid parking at the grocery store behind the restaurant. They that I get a chance to look at the pictures I guess the bright sign saying The Front Porch is easy to see. But seriously in the day time when you are looking right and left it is possible to miss it on first sight. Anyway. \n\nSecond issue was the place was packed. When we finally found a place to park and got to the front door we were asked if we had a reservation. We didn't. Yikes! We were talking to the lady and told her that this was one of the place we wanted to eat in San Francisco. She must have pulled some strings because she manage to get us a seat. \n\nThis place is small and tiny. People are practically sitting on top of each other. And it is dark too. The customers didn't seem to care though. I was checking out the menu trying to figure out what I was going to get. Of course, they have the Fried Chicken with popcorn, but I decided to get the Spicy Shrimp + Grits. It was weird to me because I am not a grits eating type of person. It was so good that once I was home I decided to make a savory grits recipe just to have the memory of how good it was. \n\nMy plan is to make my next San Francisco trip a guys only trip. There was so many bars that was passed by due to this being a family trip. Best believe that no matter why I am back in San Francisco, The Front Porch will be revisited.

Knowing the weekend brunch/lunch culture in San Francisco, I was pleasantly surprised that I could book a table so close to the reservation time.\n\nWhen my two friends and I arrived there at 12:30 sharp, the host kindly informed us that there were a couple of tables getting ready to pay, and that we'd soon be seated. This was not the case, and to no fault of the restaurant; there's no way to push people to eat faster or prevent them from taking their time, which they have every right to do. Maybe I have a higher tolerance than others for waiting for things, but the 15 minutes we had to wait before we were seated didn't seem that long at all. Furthermore, the host kindly apologized when he thought we'd been waiting too long, explaining that he could not boot guests from their seats, which was totally understandable.\n\nOnce the waiting was over, the rest of the experience was very enjoyable. We ordered the Baked Mac & Cheese starter, which was absolutely delicious! The cheese was not too overpowering, and the mac was baked to perfection.\n\nMy two companions ordered the Stoner Stack, which looked extremely appetizing. I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak with scrambled eggs and cheese grits. The Chicken Fried Steak was not too dry, and the grits were creamy and delicious as well (disclamer: I'm not really a suitable judge of grits, since this was the first time I'd ever had any). All the food we ordered was delightful, of course until the very end, when our stomachs had reached or likely surpassed their maximum capacities. The food here is extremely heavy, but that's more of an endearing quality of Southern comfort food rather than a criticism.", "author": "Andrew C."}

The grits were pure perfection, big gulf shrimp that were tender, andouille sausage was a spicy salty kick, and the red eye gravy was just magical... truly magical!\n\nFor our main course we went with the bucket of chicken with sides of mac and cheese, garlic mashers with gravy and the ham hock collards.\n\nThe mac and cheese was perfection, not overly cheese and you got a good hit of cheese with perfectly cooked noodles. The garlic mashers were just creamy enough with a great taste of garlic and the gravy was luscious and velvety. The ham hock collards were some of the best I've ever had and as good if not slightly better than my mom's (Sorry mom).\n\nThe chicken.... oh the fried chicken!

All were delicious; the portions were generous and we took a lot home. The dining room is dark, and seems like a converted garage with a few tables and bar inside.

I trek around cities finding the best fried chicken and front porch is definitely one of the best. I came here with friends on a weekend and it was packed; they had no more tables so we had it to sit by the bar. I got their fried chicken and their hush puppies. The fried chicken plate came with 4  pieces of chicken, collard greens, mashed potatoes and popcorn! Their fried chicken was bursting hot and when you bit into it, it was so moist! The breading and the seasoning was also superb! My second favorite was the collard greens! It complimented the greasiness of the fried chicken so well because it was acidic! And the mashed potatoes and gravy were delicious! I also liked how buttery the popcorn was! \n\nBut I thought their hush puppies were just ok. It was actually kind of bready in texture. \n\nTip- they have house made hot sauce! Sooo good but super spicy be careful for you have been warned!", "author": "Janet K."}

We had a reservation and were promptly seated at the large corner table next to the bar. The interior was dim lit and very small. The d\u00e9cor was intimately decked out in holiday spirit, as there were plenty of tiny light bulbs that sparkled from wall to wall. \n\nWe chose to dine family style so everyone can get a broader impression of this restaurant's Southern cuisine.  My favorite dishes start with the Fried Chicken ($34). The ten-piece bucket came with sprinkles of popcorn and the chicken was served burning hot. The texture was crisp and succulent in all the right places with a juicy buttermilk flavor that took center stage. The batter was impressively flavorful and the chicken was juicy and tender down to the last bite. All came in large pieces and there were no dry spots whatsoever. I've never paid so much for a bucket of Fried Chicken but this alone was worth 5-stars.\n\nMy second favorite item was the Mac N. Cheese ($6).  It was served in a piping hot skillet and loaded with gooey cheeses. The texture of the cheese was very good but too refined without the secondary firm blacken spots for a change of pace. The macaroni was slightly overdone due to the heat, but there was enough wow factors to keep me going for more. \n\nI also enjoyed the Fried Okra ($6) that wasn't too greasy and instead it was fried clean with a good mix of firm and soft textures. The same can be said about the Fried Pickles ($6) that came with the batter impressively attached that rendered a nice crunch before the soft tangy flavor started to kicked in. I'm a big fan of Sweet Potato Fries ($5) and the ones here were cut thick to allow for its natural flavor to come through. All of these items were fried clean with good texture and flavor. The only weakness was their dipping sauces. The mix of different aioli was thick and creamy but none of which were sufficient to change or add to the existing flavors. \n\nThe items that I do not recommend are the Biscuits ($4) as they were not as dense, flaky and flavorful as expected. The Meritons ($11) was not a good item to share as the stuffed Chayote came with a good amount of crab and shrimp but the flavors were too bland for it to pair with the rest of the food.\n\nService was outstanding as the server recommended all the right dishes to share. Our water was consistently refilled and the dinner was nicely orchestrated under its laid back atmosphere. I've had this restaurant bookmarked for over a year after I learned about it from Ligaya T and Patra B. Good quality food that comes with hipster prices. It was a great way to kick off 2012 and I would love to come back for more.", "author": "Daniel L."}

The dish comes with mashed potatoes, collared greens, and stale popcorn. This dish came out last since it takes 25 minutes to make. \n\nGumbo - could have passed on this.

The crawfish hushpuppies are basically just deep fried cornmeal balls without much actual crawfish. I expected something similar to Brenda's crawfish beignets but that was unrealistic. The fried cornmeal was delicious nonetheless albeit a little dry. I surprisingly enjoyed the deviled eggs. The sweet jam complemented the saltiness of the creamy yolk.

My husband and I were in town for our honeymoon and we had seen this place on Diners, Drive ins and Dives. I know, I know.. I'm not a huge fan of the show, but in this case, the food looked so good I wrote it down as a place we needed to eat while in SF.\n\nWe had a reservation for 6:30 on a Friday night and we were seated immediately. (I would highly recommend making a reservation!!) I won't comment much on ambience because as I've mentioned in other reviews, as long as it's clean, I don't care too too much about the ambience. That said, it was a bit chilly in the restaurant because they keep the front door open (they have a few tables out on the sidewalk) and the curtains they use to keep the cold air out don't really work. So, bring a sweater if it's chilly out.\n\nThe service was great. Everyone was friendly and helpful but very efficient. \n\nOkay, the food!\n\nTwo tiny complimentary cornbread muffins- not bad, not great, nice gesture though.\n\nThe sparkling lemonade is stellar, as is the sweet tea. It's sweet for sure but it still tastes like tea. They do it right.\n\nArugula salad- big enough for two people to share as an appetizer (but I'm a piglet so I ate it all myself). It was delicious- lightly dressed in vinaigrette, no wilted leaves, creamy goat cheese, crisp apples, crunchy sweet candied pecans and... gross persimmons. I just moved them to the side and they didn't detract from the salad. Lol just not a fan of that fruit..\n\nI got the shrimp and grits. The grits were fantastic and well cooked. The gravy was well seasoned, as were the shrimp. But, I have a suspicion that the shrimp aren't exactly fresh. A bit too shrimpy for fresh. But I ate them anyway and the dish overall lived up to my expectations. \n\nMy husband got the braised short ribs. They were super tender and flavorful. The parsnip puree was smooth and very very good (I hate parsnips and I loved it).\n\nHe also got a side of the biscuits. The biscuits were great. The little compote or jam must have been good because he didn't let me taste it. However, we both agreed that whatever herb they use in the butter makes it taste like perfume or soap. We are kind of butter purists... plain salted butter please.\n\nI also got the collards. Not horrible by any means but they didn't blow me out of the water. \n\nFor dessert I got the Apple cranberry galette. Yum! The accompanying vanilla bean ice cream was awesome.\n\nSo, two (non alcoholic) drinks, two entrees, two sides (biscuits and collards), salad and dessert ran us $94 before tip.  Worth it!", "author": "Kristin Z."}

However, the Front Porch's Shrimp and Grits topped THAT. So buttery and creamy without being grainy while still maintaining a tantalizing special mama's touch flavor... mmm. There's not much more one can demand out of some Shrimp and Grits. \n\nI went to The Front Porch with my family after we watched Cirque's Amaluna because who wouldn't want to douse themselves in ounces and ounces of butter after watching excruciatingly fit acrobats perform ab busting stunts.  \n\nThe ambiance is very low key, homey (if your home resembles a laid back pub on Bourbon Street), dimly lit (not in a sexy & trendy way but rather in a more cozy and laid back way) and there literally is a front porch at the front of the restaurant. The waitress was extremely friendly and made some great recommendations. \n\nEveryone in my family enjoyed all of the entrees and appetizers but I'd have to say the highlights (aside from the epic Shrimp and Grits) were the Fried Chicken (juicy, tender and uniquely flavorful), the jambalaya risotto balls (SO FREAKING FLAVORFUL and moderately spicy) and the country captain braised duck leg. \n\nAlso, don't forget to check out the cocktail menu - the drinks are very well made!\n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!", "author": "Priya S."}

It's also quite dry when I ate them. 3/5\n- Cesar salad. It's quite good, but not really the main reason folks are here obviously. 4/5\n- Shrimp and the grid. It's a shrimp inside mash potato like stew with a few sausages inside. It was good, but nothing out of ordinary. 3/5\n- the main dish: fried chicken meal (4 pieces). Similar to the the deep fried biscuit, it tasted a bit bitter. Again probably caused by over frying or the oil being used a lot. It's also quite dry so it really wasn't good. 3/5\n- a great treat is the root beer float courtesy of Mitchell' ice cream across the street!\n\nSo overall it's not as good as I expected.

One of those hidden gems that causes you to double back to check out the name and the menu out front.\n\nOn what became a rainy Sunday morning, the gf and I decided to indulge in some delicious Southern brunch.\n\n*WARNING* Chicken and waffles take super long! They do mention this (\"please allow 25 minutes\"), but with a packed house, it seems like everyone has gotten their food, before you... and evidently except rest of your table too. You've been warned... and hope your table doesn't hate you for delaying their food.\n\nAnyways, when the chicken and waffles did finally come out (definitely far after the 25 min mark), it was an amusing little arrangement of three small pieces of chicken on top of a waffle. Wow, I've had loads of fried chicken come out faster than this, and either in larger quantities or better cooked, or both. Were they launching chickens towards the sun, and just waiting for their return?\n\nThe sweet potato and pulled pork hash was alright. Nothing special. A little greasy, but filling for a long day ahead.\n\nI can see this place being a really fun spot for food towards the dinner time, but it's pretty mediocre when it comes to brunch.", "author": "Kevin J."}

We came here for brunch and got the chicken and waffles and biscuits and gravy. This place would've been a solid 5 stars in my book if it weren't for the biscuits and gravy, but unfortunately this dish was lacking a little in every aspect. The biscuits were too hard and even though the gravy was creamy, smooth, and infused with sausage-y flavor without being overly salty, there just wasn't enough of it in the bowl to sop up the biscuits with. Plus, my dish only came out warm and not hot, so you can imagine how it might be a bit unpleasant finishing up cold, stiff biscuits with not enough gravy (see pic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/wxzx3duu1c0CcomzEOvfOQ?select=119nzF-q8qHfGuiTMkdisQ) ...quite disappointing.\n\nBut, back to the chicken. This is some of the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I've ever had. There's just enough breading on the outside to give a little crunch. And if you get the chicken and waffles, be sure to try it all together - the combination of crispy waffle, rich butter, salty-crunchy chicken, and sweet maple syrup is just amazing. I probably clogged my arteries and risked a heart attack eating this meal but trust me, I would have died a very happy person!\n\nFun ambience too, it feels comfy and I like that they cover the bathroom doors with curtains :). Prices are all right for a brunch place ($14 for chicken and waffles and $7 for biscuits and gravy).

I just want to say that Front Porch was a true delight.\n\nBeing on somewhat of a comfort food kick, I ordered up the baked mac 'n cheese and the bucket o' chicken (10 pcs) for my roommate's birthday. Went to pick up as our house is fighting a cold and couldn't make it out, but the ambiance was adorable. There is outdoor seating where a family with their little kids were sitting; twinkly lights and knick knacks in the front, not sure about the back (didn't get that far), inside was dimly lit and cozy, looks like a nice date spot. Full bar and plenty of tables. An obvious regular followed close behind me and we were both greeted by the bartender with true enthusiasm, like she was happy to see her friends. The waitress who helped me called me \"honey\" (nice people rule).\n\nHaving ordered to go, I was immediately approached by a waitress who went to check on the order in the kitchen. Order was ready, about $40 for it all (which is a bit pricey considering it was chicken and pasta...). We got home and dished out the steaming, cheesy mac and I couldn't help but take the first bite, mid-scoop. It was really good! We sat down and dug into giant morsels of golden brown fried chicken. So moist and full of flavor, no one used hot sauce at all, which we normally would do. \n\nGood portion sizes and really hit the spot for just what we wanted. I might be a little addicted to the mac 'n cheese, but hey, it's hard to find a good, tasty mac 'n cheese in the city, and trust me, I've looked. Enjoy, people!", "author": "Crystal C."}

We reward ourselves with a cheat meal and somehow their Fried Chicken started calling my name after a visit up to Point Reyes for oysters.\n\nThey were nice enough to squeeze a party of 4 in at the last minute and we ordered a good variety of dishes to try.\n\nMac and Cheese - Pretty damn good for restaurant mac and cheese. Eat hot.... there was a crispy crunchy layer of toasted cheese on top while the mac was bathed in creamy goodness. When I bit down on the mac, it squirted out a dollop of butter in my mouth. Definitely a high caloric splurge side!!\n\nGumbo - It was well flavored and I could taste the butter and rich fat that was emulsified in. I dread to even THINK about how many calories it was but it was one of the better gumbo's I've had in the Bay Area.\n\nFried Chicken - Definitely delicious! Yelp did not lead us wrong! We ordered the entree for four of us to share. The garlic mashed was delicious and I don't think I'll ever grow to like collard greens but that's just a personal preference issue. The chicken was well brined and well fried. It didn't taste like a grease bomb like the Addendum version I had a few months ago. \n\nDr. Pepper Short RIbs - Interesting tangy sweet sauce, short ribs were well braised so they were falling off tender. I loved the celery root mash!!\n\nPorch Chop - Delicious!! Good porky flavor, served medium. Creamed corn left little to be desired. It tasted slightly sour and seemed like they added some sort of alcohol that needed to be cooked out. \n\nFlounder w/ Jambalaya - DELICIOUS!!! Texture of the fish was perfectly crunchy and the jambalaya was delicious. Found nice large chunks of blue crab meet.\n\nShrimp and Grits - YELP YOU FAILED ME!!!! *CRIES* this was my entree... after FALLING IN LOVE with the shrimp and grits at Petite Toulouse in Seattle. The shrimp here wasn't large and plump... and the grits were pretty flavorless. Gravy left little to the imagination.

Got seated in one of their booths and took a minute to decide what we were gonna order.\n\nThe interior feels very down south, homey feeling... which is nice and comforting since I was about to indulge in a bunch of comfort food!\n\nWe Decided on a bucket of fried chicken, that comes with a side of mashed and collard greens.. and also got a side of baked mac n cheese.\n\nNOTE: the chicken and mac n cheese takes a while to come out, so if you're absolutely starving, I'd definitely suggest getting a starter.\n\nPrior to everything coming out, we got two pieces of corn bread with jalapeno butter spread.. the corn bread was warm... oddly shaped, as I have never seen it in that form/shape.. the butter was good but a bit flavorless and didn't help much with the cornbread. \n\nSo, in my honest opinion... I did not like the chicken very much... first off, I wasn't a fan on how they fried it... it wasn't too crispy and quite greasy.. it wasn't even juicy... I would have rather ate at Popeye's for the price of The Front Porch's bucket..  \n\nThe collard greens were SOOOOO sour... made it hard to swallow..\n\nThe mashed were good.... flavorful.... and creamy..\n\nThe mac n cheese was truthfully the only other thing that was okay.... and that would be sad to have been messed up..\n\nAs usual... I am always on the look out for good customer service... it was sad to see that I was never asked how we were doing after we took our order.. I eventually had to flag the girl down for some ketchup. \n\nMediocre food... and mediocre service.. MEHHHH......", "author": "Tiff C."}

I was so surprised to find that I was able to make a reservation just two hours before, which was nice. The reservation was set for 12:00 pm for a party of 2.  We got there 5 mins early, but actually didn't get seated till around 15/20 mins later. I noticed a couple folks (who didn't have reservations) arrive around the same time & the wait time, even with a reservation, was pretty even. No big deal, but I probably could've used those extra minutes to even out my wing liner instead of rushing to make our reservation. (Enter palm face here.)\n\nThe bf and I were seated outside. First off, the setting/theme is so cute.  The fact that its literally a front porch is amazing & I really enjoyed the homey vibes.  There are a bunch of mismatch benches/chairs (rocking & static) and even a little rocking horse for those waiting to be seated. I thought it was cute how they had a sign out front in which invited guests to take advantage of the surrounding business while waiting to get seated.  Oh, and brownie points because about 4/6 of the tables out front had their pups with them. As I ALWAYS immediately fall in love with every dog I see, this was a plus for me. I'll be returning with my schnauzer next time. Anyways, we split everything--the beignets, the Stoner Stack, and the Chicken and Waffles. The beignets were good. Super light and not too sweet. I would get them again, but am I wrong for saying they're ain't thattttt special? The Stoner Shack, I really enjoyed.  The chicken & bacon was nice and crisp, as were the potatoes. The onions with the potatoes were BOMB.  I just really wish there was more gravy though. By the time the chicken & waffles came out, I was pretty full at this point. I ate a quarter of the waffle and a piece of chicken. The waffle had bacon pieces in it! I could've done without, but still good.\n\nThe only reason that this isn't a 5 star review is because service was a little EH. Don't get me wrong, everyone was super friendly, just felt a little short handed.  All in all, for brunch the food was great. Not anything out of this world, but what makes this place  special are the vibes and setting. I'll definitely have to try dessert next time.", "author": "Julie Ann B."}

It's a small restaurant, as with most restaurants I'm San Francisco you want to eat at the ones that have the longest wait. As a tourist this is a hard concept, but as a local you know people will wait for good food.\n\nThis is no exception. Good food all around, fun quirky menu to throw you a chuckle. The shrimp and grits were spot on as were the hash (even though the menu said \"sweet potatoes\" they were not sweet potatoes (but still a very tasty treat).  A good variety of beers are available, I did enjoy the decor of the restaurant. \n\nIt is a little on the dark side (perfect for hangovers), the music was a little interesting I would have thought the music would have been more jazz themed? The beignets were not what I've had in he past in New Orleans, but the portions are so generous that you don't really need desert.\n\nSomeone took my friends chair when he was in the bathroom.

I went here last night with a few friends,  my second time, and I had to take the time to write a review this morning.  Go here.  You will NOT be disappointed.\n\nFood/Drinks\nOur evening started off by presenting them a very nice bottle of Pinot we brought to have them open for us.  No fuss, no hassle, like so many SF restaurants with attitude give you.  We also ordered glasses of white wine to start off and the deviled eggs as an appetizer.  The eggs, slightly smoky, were unbelievable....who'd of thought, something that simple could be so delicious. \n\nFor dinner, we each got something different (pork chop, braised short rib, fried chicken) so we could share things.  The pork and short ribs were \"spoon tender\", perfectly cooked (not over cooked) and melted in your mouth with very different layers of flavor; simple food made complex.  As a fried chicken aficionado, this place cannot be beat and I've eaten it ALL over the USA.  The chicken is very crispy, a very nice heat (spice) to it, not a bit of grease, and the meat is as tender as it gets.  The portions are huge, but with some arm twisting, we did a good job finishing everything.  : )\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the beignets were more than we needed, but what the heck.  I had a cognac, very good price for a very good vsop.  One other in our party had a beer/coffee liquer drink suggested by the waitress (\"The Best Part of Waking Up\").  It was good.  Very different.  (see more under service).\n\nService\nPerfect.  I do a lot of cooking and, while I really appreciate great food, service is what makes it for me.  I can't say enough.  She was helpful.  Honest.  And, as I mentioned up above, when my friend didn't completely enjoy the \"coffee/beer\" drink, she took it off the bill without us even asking.\n\nGo here!", "author": "John S."}

I poked around on the internet looking for the best, and we decided to finally try The Front Porch.\n\nFirst, the style is exactly to our tastes, as is the music. It's sort of like a old timey dive bar hybrid southern comfort diner with kitsch so classy it ain't kitsch no mo'. The ambiance and comfort is top notch IMO.\n\nWe had a reservation for the opening time of 10 on Sunday (today). Our waitress came right away, but the meal took a while to get to us - some kitchen issues, but seriously.. don't you dare ding them for a stall. The food was orgasmic.\n\nSurprisingly light for such an often heavy and greasy fare. I mean, it was indulgent for sure, but we felt great after we cleaned our plates - a rarity in southern cooking. Usually the eating is great and afterwards you're kind of ashamed of what you just did to yourself. \n\nThe boyfriend had the Stoner Stack with potatoes. It was divine. We had the fried egg on top; It's a stack of fried chicken bacon cheese and country sausage gravy on a biscuit. INSANELY GOOD.\n\nI ordered the chicken fried steak with two eggs over easy and cheesy grits. It was amazing. At first, I agreed his was the winner of the two, but after continuing to eat these items in the same bite and had the flavors developing and harmonizing - It's dead heat. This place is our new favorite breakfast place.\n\nSince my boyfriend makes killer breakfast, we rarely ever go out and pay for it. But this place can expect to see us there on the regular.\n\nSeriously. I love The Front Porch so much - I'd fight someone over it.", "author": "Jane H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-24", "description": "Came for brunch after the Giant Race with my mom. The atmosphere and food are phenomenal!!! We were starved after the 10k and decided to pretty much order enough food for like 5 people. Started with the beignets and fried okra, then chicken & waffles and the shrimp po'boy. Enjoyed a bloody mary and a schlitz-alada to quench our thirst. We sat outside so I don't have any impression of the inside other than it's dark and small.\n\nBeignets - Warm pillows of sweet dough camouflaged under a thick layer of powdered sugar. No dips or sauces (which is how I prefer them) and they come in a cute brown paper bag. They were the perfect start to this meal!!\n\nFried okra - honestly the real reason why we decided to get these was because of the jalapeno aioli. The okra was cut into large pieces then fried in a thin batter so you could really taste the (somewhat) slimy texture. The jalapeno aioli was a beautiful combo of creamy and spicy. It was definitely worth getting this dish for the dip but I don't think I'll be ordering them again, maybe just a side of the aioli for my fries!\n\nChicken & waffle - best decision I made all day! I'd never had chicken and waffles before so I wasn't sure what to expect. Based on other reviews and recommendations, I think I was just hoping for something filling, comforting, and savory. It absolutely delivered!! It comes with 3 pieces of hearty chicken that are battered in a creole spiced concoction and fried until deep brown. The waffle was thin but if it was thicker, you wouldn't be able to taste the chunks of bacon hidden in the mix. I didn't even put butter on the dish and used less than a spoonful of the maple syrup. It was just too good to not enjoy it in it's naked state. I couldn't even finish the dish which is literally unheard of me. Must have been the second beignet I consumed!\n\nShrimp po'boy - I didn't get to try this dish since we were so full (see above!). It looked delicious and my mom said it was pretty good but dry. The bread looked like a toasted baguette and it was pretty hard. The shrimp were HUGE - so big that they looked like pieces of white fish more than shrimp. The french fries were sprinkled with a healthy dose of some creole seasoning but again, had so much to eat that they were barely touched. I'd love to try this dish the next time and get a better idea of the flavors all together.\n\nDrinks - their bloody mary mix is damn good! Not too spicy but has an amazing flavor and tastes very fresh (not even sure if they make their own or not but it's fantastic!). I had the schlitz-alada/michelada (i.e. bloody mary mix with a pacifico). It was a match made in heaven with my chicken and waffle.\n\nThe reason why it doesn't get 5 stars is because of our waitress. She seemed a bit annoyed that we were there and wasn't attentive at all. The food runners had so much more personality and communication skills than she did so it was sort of a blessing that she only came around to take our order and drop off the check. After we ordered our food, she rudely grabbed the menus and we had to stop her to place our drink order before she ran inside and disappeared. She also didn't come by to see how everything was so her attitude didn't give off the comforting southern hospitality vibe that they want to have going for them. \n\nMoral of the story - Food is really, really good!! Go try it for yourself! I'd definitely like to come back and be able to hang a bit longer. I'll probably not order quite as much food so I could actually enjoy my full meal but I'm glad we were gluttonous the first time around!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

There was no issue because there were at least two open tables. I highly suggest you make reservations on any day of the week or time because within 15 minutes there was a wait.\n\nFood here is five stars and in case you missed it the fried chicken is excellent, superb and wonderfully tasty. On the inside it's juicy and tender and on the outside crispy and crunchy. Definitely top five in the city, no question.  I'm not going to get into the complexity of a thin exterior crust that pulls off the skin but it's marvelous. My dinner came on a prison lunch tray with popcorn, greens (excellent), mash potatoes with gravy and the most amazing fried chicken I've had in a long time. I was told when I placed the order there may be up to a 20+ minute wait. If I was in a hurry I'd go to KFC so this isn't an issue for me.

That casual nature translates in both great and not-so-great ways.\n\nWe arrived a bit early for an 8pm reservation. Our party was in full attendance (five of us in total), but we didn't sit until about 8:20pm. The staff at the front was courteous but seemed a bit detached while we waited. \n\nWhen we did sit, they put us at a four-person booth with a chair shoehorned onto the end of the table. Not a cozy set up, so I'd be wary of comfort if you're thinking about dining here with a five-person party. The service was attentive but not particularly personable. Others referenced \"southern charm\" with their dining experiences; for us... meh, not so much.\n\nThe food was quite good. We ordered the Fried Okra and Crawfish Hush Puppies as apps, and I had the Shrimp and Grits for a main. The apps were good, but nothing to write home about. I really enjoyed the Shrimp and Grits, and would recommend that to folks dining here. I also tried my SO's Farmer's Vegan entree, which was quite delicious, too.\n\nPrice-wise, I think The Front Porch offers good value for what you get. Multiple bottles of wine, cocktails, appetizers, entrees, and a couple desserts set us back $60 per person with tip. Not too shabby for a Friday night in SF, if you ask me.", "author": "Matt T."}

Bloody mary is ok -- could have used more flavor, although the optional bacon bits rimmed around the edge of the glass is a nice touch.  \n\nThe fried okra was crisply fried and served with a mysterious but yummy sauce.  It was ok.  Shrimp and grits was ok.  Country fried steak was ok, although a little chewy, and a little tough.  All in all, it was *ok.*  It wasn't memorable, and probably not worth my trek across town (which I was super late for, but that is another story).  If you want memorable shrimp and grits, go to Brenda's in the TL, and if you want memorable country fried steak, go to Hard Knox.  \n\nBUT, they did serve *perfect* sunny side up eggs.

Chicken was cooked perfectly, but the crust was not as crisp as I had hoped.  It was very garlicy and too the point it changed the flavor of the chicken to a bit sour tasting.  Very odd.   The greens were also a bit sour tasting but decent.   I prefer a little sweeter and buttery southern style greens.  \n\nCornbread was ok. Too small portions.  It's cornbread.  They should offer big piping hot pieces. Not literally one bite samples.  \n\nMashed potatoes and gravy were meh.  Nothing special here.  Gravy was greasy and bland.  Should have had a bit more salt to add pop to the potatoes.  Instead both were bland and i didn't finish eating it. \n\nOxtail fries were good. Except they put only one piece of oxtail in the fries.  The rest was gravy covered fries.   \n\nService was excellent.  Offered bar seating and was fine with that.  Weekends you better reserve or expect to wait.

Everything we had was remarkable with soul oozing out of the pores . . . the fried chicken was everything I've ever dreamed of: crispy but not greasy, not too dark or scorched, golden brown with those collard greens I could eat by the bucketful--tangy and smoky. The mashed potatoes with a ladle of gravy I could a trough of easily. And gravy is an iffy thing with so many people not knowing how to get the texture thick but not clumpy, but these people have the talent of gravy I shall say. The biscuits I all but inhaled; even my husband who's not a biscuit fan (I know, who doesn't love biscuits, right?), loved them. We got a bunch of sides and also the meatloaf which is my weakness. Such a charming place, a little house, a ton of attitude and a vibe of hippie rockster. It was packed, even though we showed up at the opening dinner hour, and it was deafening. I mean loud beyond anything, to the point we couldn't hear anything. It was literally an eat an run expedition for us. Though I love this place so much, it'll be a while before we go back, only for the noise level.

But I came for brunch with a friend a few weeks ago and won't be going back again. \n\nWe'd made a reservation about a week in advance, but when we arrived on time, we were told we would have to wait for the other people who had reservations who arrived before us. Okay, fine. The wait didn't end up being that long and we got an outside table. \n\nI ordered some kind of egg platter, and asked if I could make a substitution for the meat since I'm vegetarian. The server said I could sub fruit, so I did. She didn't mention there would be an up-charge; that was just a surprise I got when the bill arrived. \n\nFor the most part the food was very good. But the main part of the dish, the scrambled eggs, arrived in a literal pool of oil. They were swimming in grease. I tried a few bites but they were just too greasy to eat. So I ate everything else but had barely touched the eggs. When another server came to collect our dishes, he didn't ask if anything was wrong despite the fact that most of my meal was still on my plate. \n\nWe got the check, and as we were signing our bills, a string of lights fell down on me, with one of the bulbs smacking the back of my head. It hurt a bit, but mostly was just very startling. The waitress was just coming out, and we explained what happened (with the string of lights still dangling in between us) and she went back in to get the owner. He came out and sort of halfheartedly apologized. (It turned out the lights were very haphazardly attached to the fence with twist ties, which was clearly no match for a windy Bernal morning.) As he re-attached the lights to the twist tie, he offered us a round of free drinks, but we were already paid and planning to leave. He did not offer to comp any part of our meal, or even offer a free meal in the future. Not that it would have mattered, as I won't be returning.", "author": "K M."}

While the menu and restaurant is small it is full of big taste and character. Plus, the water is served in 40 ounce bottles. When was the last time you had a 40 ;) \n\nFriends and I gathered here for a birthday. They take reservations which is seemingly becoming a rarity for small popular restaurants. Not all of us arrived at the same time but they allowed us to check in then go \"outside\" (actually, across the street to the bar) while we waited for the rest of our party. Considering the petite size of the restaurant I thought that was kind. There were 10 of us so we had the pleasure of sitting in a corner booth with a huge round table, perfect considering all the food we ordered and tabletop space we needed! \n\nConsensus was 2 thumbs up on the drinks ordered (Porch swing, jalapeno margarita, porch light, lovely day). I ordered the Porch light: Texas vodka, luxardo maraschino, Campari, pineapple - delicious! If I hadn't been driving back to the East Bay after dinner I would have had more than one of this delight. \n\nMy friends raved about their entrees and appetizers. I tasted the following: \n-Winter wedge salad: It was a nice crispy salad made up of 2 good sized wedges. \n-Baked Mac n cheese: MUST TRY! Cheesy mac served hot in a skillet and crusted on top! \n-Jalapeno deviled eggs cost: Humorously cost 6.66 . So good my friends and I are attempting them at our next function!\n-Gumbo: More spicy than salty (as described perfectly by my friend) and even though it is listed an appetizer it's actually a good size for an entree. \n\nDesserts! KICK ASS GOOD! \nApple crisp: Served like a pot pie with ice cream on top. Sweet, spicy, hot, good texture! \nButterscotch cheesecake: I didn't try this but a friend at the table apparently \"made love to it\"\nChocolate trifle: Served in a larger shot glass. Layers of chocolate and cake. \nBrioche bread pudding: My favorite! A large portion served. \n\nBy the end of the night as we were handling the cash and cards at our table, the server came to us and said unsolicited \"Let me know what you guys want to do... I can do anything\" Again smaller places usually aren't so accommodating and I know how annoying it is for large parties and splitting bills... she was very sweet and flexible. \n\nI would have rated this place 5 stars except the only chicken they offer is fried.

And the jalapeno aioli that came with the fried okra was good, not the fried okra though.  OK so let me start at the beginning.  \n\nWe show up on Sunday afternoon around 12:45.  I tell the host that we had 3 and he asked me in a semi-horrified manner if we had a reservation.  I told him no and he said \"Ok well I'll be able to get you in in about 20-30 minutes.  *looks around* actually probably sooner, is your whole party here?\"  (I was totally confused as to why he acted like I was inside for showing up with no reservation then said it would be 20 minutes, I digress) I told him yes and went out front to wait with my girlfriends.  About 30-40 minutes later I checked in with him and he looked at me like it had been 30 seconds and shrugged and said \"uhh Idunno maybe like 20 minutes or so?\" um. what?  20 minutes later my pregnant friend (hungry, uncomfortable, swollen feet, read: watch out) went in to ask again and he told her with a great deal of snide attitude that we were next and it would be a few minutes.  About 10 minutes later we were called in.  Note that everybody waiting for a table was extremely pissed off and were in the same boat as us, INCLUDING people who had made reservations.     \n\nWe sat down and you know that kind of server who comes over and doesn't introduce themselves and just like puts waters down and just kind of acts like you come in 3 times a day and no greeting is even necessary?  i don't know if I described that correctly but its not like a familiar friendly attitude its like an obnoxious lazy can't be bothered way too cool attitude.  So she does that.  I don't know her name but I think she had an English accent.  Hard to say since she barely talked to us.  She barely ever came to the table and when she did she rushed us and was not friendly.  I ordered a Bloody Mary and it was the worst one I have ever had, it just had a really strange flavor I can't even really describe what it was, it was bitter and just strange.  Later I got a Lovely Day cocktail and it was pretty gross too, really cheap gin and really abrasive other flavors, do not recommend.  My girlfriend ordered a lemonade and she had to add sugar to it at the table, I totally didn't think I would agree but I tasted it pre-sugar and it was just lemon water (and they charge $3.50 each with no refills, really steep for lemon water).  \n\nThe fried okra tasted like it used those breadcrumbs from a canister and a lot of seasoning packet.  The jalape\u00f1o aioli was awesome and I'd eat a shoe dipped in that.  If I were to go again I would get an order of fries and a side of that aioli and call it a day.  The chicken and waffles was gross- the chicken was overly salty and I assume it is brined and whatever was in the brine just made the meat taste really strange, again I'm sorry that is not descriptive, it was just weird.  The worst part was the waffle, it was soggy and had gross chewy pieces of bacon studded in it just creating more saltiness.  It was a quite small portion and I hardly finished half.  Oh and its $18!! Where do these people get off?!?!?! The prices are INSANE!!! $50 per person for brunch.  \n\nMy friend got the shrimp and grits and it was OFF THE HOOK,  I only had one bite and maybe I was extremely hungry and disappointed by my own food but my memory is that it was awesome.  Recommend.  BUT, then again, shrimp and grits is sorta hard to fuck up.  Well maybe its not hard to fuck up but its also easy to get right.  \n\nThe server never came by to see how we were or ask if we wanted anything else, which we did, we wanted more cocktails the whole time.  She finally came by and put the check on the table and I had to ask if we could add to it and get more drinks.  Find a new line of work lady.  \n\nIf you want mediocre at best food, a rude host who is either lying to keep business or is just also really bad at his job, overpriced bad drinks using cheap well liquor all served to you by a person who is bothered by you and took cool for serving tables, come to Front Porch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-06-10", "description": "The Front Porch is this quaint hole in the wall near 29th and Mission St in the City.  The facade has rocking chairs and a tacky hillbilliesque like decor that looks like something out of an early John Waters movie. The inside, dark, refreshing and retro looking almost as if it had once been a night club back in the day.\n\nThe food here is pretty good, but it needs a little bit of improvement.  I mean, given the cost, which'll have yah hung at the gallows at around $30/person,  you better get some southern food that tastes of Southern Lovin'.  I have to admit, \"expensive southern cuisine\" seemed a bit of an oxymoron to me.  I guess, in terms of SF money, $30/head is considered cheap.\n\nAnd the service should have that Southern lovin' vibe too.  But that wasn't the case.\n\nWarning: A rant: and a bit of an anti-social SF editorial (keep in mind I came to this place with high expectations and had a strong craving for both southern cuisine and Southern Hospitality):\n\nService was typical \"cool\" \"avante garde\" SF.  I hate to ding this place, but when I go to the south, there's a special feeling that I'm welcome home.  In SF, there's always a feeling in establishments that one is a) not good enough; b) below their standards...you know that snob, uptight vibe.  That's just how San Franciscans are.  If you get that typical SF service in a restaurant that purports to be a Southern Restaurant, it completely ruins the vibe, and quite honestly, shits on the spirit of Southern Hospitality.\n\nAlso, when I go into a \"southern establishment\" I expect something more than just cliches.  I expect music and references to be true south.  I didn't get that here.  Case in point, the music played was Guns'n'Roses and AC DC.  That's not southern music.  I expect bands to be obscure country bands from the Appalachian Mountains or something other than \"Sweet Child 'o Mine.\"\n\nNow that I vented my frustrations about the culturally wreckifcation of the south, I think I can go more on the quality of the food.\n\nIt was good but not rootin' tootin' good.\n\nFor starters, there was a complimentary appetizer, albeit, a joke of one at that: a tiny serving of a miniature corn bread muffin about the size of my thumb.  At first, I thought it was a joke and was looking for cameras.  It was like a crumb.  When you have two 200lb men sitting down at an establishment purported to be Southern Cooking, you don't give nothing less than a pound of corn bread.  I was flabbergasted by how small the serving size was.\n\nAfter that, we had something that was fries and a crawfish sauce or something like that.  It was pretty tasty.  For add'l appetizers, I stumbled upon a perfect example of the bastardization of a culture: fried pickles and.......get this: aioli sauce?  WTF?  In the south?  Aioli is some snobby San Franciscan sauce made because it ain't cool to say ketchup and mayo with a dash of cayenne pepper and herbs.\n\nI guarantee that in the South, Aioli ain't even a word.\n\nStill, although I liked it, it tarnished my perception of what this place was trying to do.  What next? Apple Pie with nonfat soy ice cream a la mode?\n\nAnnoying.  All in all, the fried pickles were good, but not in a \"thanks for the nostalgia and taking me back to Nashville sense.\n\nFor the final dish, I had fried chicken, potatos, and collard greens.  The fried chicken dish, four excellent pieces, was very good.  BUT, I am suspicious that they simply drove to a Church's Chicken on Geneva Ave. bought a bucket for 8 pieces for $10, and drove right back, placed on a plat and charged us $18/head for the meal.\n\nI mean, it's scientifically not possible to muck up fried chicken.\n\nAs for the collard greens, I had deep psychological issues. For they tasted papery.  Not enough love was put in putting 'em together.\n\nAll in all, if you're from the Bay Area, and you want true Southern Cuisine, don't come here.  If you come without that expectation, this place can get a bump up to 4 stars.  There is some quality here.  But if you're looking for a southern experience,  you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe place is good.  But not a home run.  I'm giving this 3 stars because if I had a desperate craving for fried chicken, and I was driving by here, I'd probably come in and take a seat.  So, if you're not too high strung, like I am, about what a restaurant experience should be, do not worry about what I've written here, you'll probably have a good time.", "author": "Tony U."}

If you can I do suggest eating on the porch because i swear it gives your food a different flavor just because of the ambience (which is really why I'm giving this place 4 stars). We started off with the hush puppies because that's what I saw most popular on the reviews, let me save you, DON'T order them. I was so sad that I didn't love these because I wanted to so bad. They seemed dry to me and lacked a lot of that crawfish flavor you'd expect. We went on with ordering a bucket of chicken, mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese and biscuits which were overall satisfying and comforting. The chicken is delicious with it's crunchy flavor packed exterior and so moist and tender inside. The MAC n cheese was extremely cheesy (and greasy) I like it but not sure if I loved it.

However with so much hype to the place it really made it difficult for me to have my own true opinion. With that said...lets start this review. It's a Saturday afternoon on a busy pride weekend. We have had a lot to drink and are now hungry and realize hey we're close to the front porch let's call and see if we could maybeeee get in. Luckily it wasn't so busy yet because it was early, they said sure come in we'll get you seated right away and sure enough we showed up 30 mins later and were seated at the bar. We gander the menu and make a couple of decisions. I ordered a bourbon ginger beer and my partner got a water. The drink was made stiff-perfect. Now on to the food. I ordered the 4 piece fried chicken with collard greens and mashed potatoes. My wifey got a hamburger with their own homemade American cheese, now normally I'd be like Hunnie...American cheese? Lol but she seemed pretty dead set on that decision so we went with it. My food came out on a tray with a line of popcorn on the side. I would've throughly enjoyed that but I have braces so I had to refrain, a bit odd to be there but I think my wife thought they were good. The collard greens were not my favorite, they weren't chopped up like I'm used to and they simply tasted a little funny to me. The mashed potatoes came with a scoop full of gravy which always pleases me so brownie points there and the friend chicken was crisp on the outside and tender on the inside which was great. BUT the big winner for us was the hamburger. The fries were just ok as they seemed to be a bit soggy but the hamburger itself was on a semi sweet soft bun and it was juicy, but what made it really special was that darn cheese! My goodness! I would definitely come back for the burger.", "author": "Guisela L."}

With the help of SeatMe via Yelp, the experience from beginning to the end was just perfect.\n\nWe arrived for our Noon reservation via SeatMe and we were promptly seated in the dining room.  The restaurant is very dimly lit; I probably would've prefer sitting outside, but outside seating is limited to 4  tables. The menu consisted of small bits, their specialties, mains, Benedict options, and a po'Bot Sammie section.  Given there are 4 of us, we opt to share a little of everything.  We ordered the beignets, fried okra, and gumbo to start...oh and I did try their Bloody Mary with candied bacon rim.  The gumbo came first, then the okra and end with the power sugared beignets.  My favs were the gumbo and beignets. The paras were good but I didn't really taste much flavor in the okra.  They also use the okra in the Bloody Mary and I didn't think it did much to the Mary...maybe I'm a traditionalist.\n\nFor the main course, we chose chicken & waffle of course, the egg and grits, and the crab cake po'Boy. They were all delicious. The grits were all cheesy and buttery creamy goodness.  The Chicken and Waffle was cooked to perfection.  The meat was juicy and skin was crispy combined with the bacon waffle...yes there are bits of real bacon in the waffle.  The crab cake  po'Boy was served between a soft baguette and also served with home cut fries. The crab cake is fried to perfection and the sandwich is lightly smeared with remoulade.  The food were just fantastic and they were timed perfectly since we were sharing and enjoying our conversation. We never felt we were overloaded with food nor did we feel like we had to wait forever for the next course.\n\nOur server was a young girl from South Africa.  Very pleasant and attentive.

The decor is absolutely adorable and homey, with rocking horses, a diverse array of potted plants, and small windows with curtains. This is the type of restaurant that belongs in a movie where the characters go on a perfect first date.\n\n- Fried Okra with Jalapeno Aioli ($7.50): I loved the contrast in texture between the fried breading and the squishy okra. The jalapeno aioli is not too spicy, and really gives a good kick of flavor.\n\n- Biscuits ($4.50/2 biscuits): These come with preserves and sage butter. Nothing special; I guess KFC has ruined my biscuit standards.\n\n- Baked Mac & Cheese ($8): I liked the shell-shaped pasta they used as the mac, and the cheese is not too overpowering. I did find this a bit undercooked.\n\n- Apple + Spice Brined Pork Chop ($21): I appreciate a good savory and sweet combination, and I'm really impressed by how much the apple flavor comes out in the meat. The homemade cranberry mustard on top of the pork chop is actually amazing (I don't like mustard, especially the grainy stuff, and I never choose to put it on my food). The bed of brussel sprouts and cornbread continued the savory and sweet trend.\n\n- Mulled Wine ($8): Those small moments of London always make my heart break. The wine is heavy on the spices and lower on the sweet factor than what I was expecting, but this is probably the most similar I've had in the states.\n\nAll dishes come with a mini cornbread with sage butter. They also give you their two spice sauces (the lighter bottle is more spicy), which you can buy by the bottle for $6 or 8. The place was quite crowded on a Saturday night at 7:30PM, so make a reservation if possible.\n\nStare fondly at the rocking horses. Front Porch rocks!", "author": "Jessica F."}

Especially when we have the same taste in good food, we seek it out and want to share our experiences. On a recent night out, we decided to take a little walk to the Front Porch for some fun and good eats. \n\nWe arrived at Front Porch, while we were waiting we snagged some seats at the bar and ordered a bottle of Duvel for us to share. We were not as hungry, so we decided to split an appetizer and a meal to split.\n\nTo start we had the Blue Crab Corn Fritters w/ Criolla Remoulade - which were great. I love my crab and was happy to get a little seafood fix as part of the meal. \n\nThey serve you cob shaped mini corn breads with a flavored butter. I only wish they were a little bigger, but they were tasty. \n\nFor the main course we split the chicken plate, 3 pieces of juicy breaded fried chicken, garlic mashers and collard greens. Although they are not boneless chicken breasts, they cut the meat perfectly so that there are minimal bones and seemed like decent sized portions of food. Especially for two to share. \n\nThe 3 Front Porch sauces they serve should be sold to the public, I want a set. I loved the green chili, the red sauce and the yellow habanero. Colorful yet very flavorful sauces are key and I love it spicy!!! \n\nWe even made it out with some leftover, which I took a little leftover fried chicken which we diced up the next day and served on a homemade pizza.

I mix the sunny egg all the way through mine and add hot sauce to it and I swear if I close my eyes it's like my grandma just made it and set it down for me.

Choleeeeesterooool. Anyway, the fried chicken here is pretty good but any southerner might be a bit miffed to put down that much cash for a few pieces of fried chicken that is mediocre by dirty south standards. This is a strange criticism but the chicken just tastes a bit too clean/californicated? By clean I mean bland. Just used to a stronger pork lard taste in my fried chicken.  \n\nFavorite part of the meal was the fried okra and macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese was so bubbly good. You can practically do anything to okra and it'll be awesome. \n\nThe place has a really laid back atmosphere but is a bit dark. If they increased the lumens just a lil bit, it would make a huge difference.  So, simply put, if you've grown up in the South and are a west coast transplant (like me), this will help to satisfy your soul food cravings.

We left disappointed and spent the rest of the night questioning how this place received such high accolades on Yelp. \n\nFood: The food was disappointing. We had the Fried Chicken, which was basic and if blindfolded you wouldn't be able to taste the difference between their chicken and Roscoe's chicken. The Mac and Cheese was decent but wasn't anything to write home about. The Side of Biscuits was really the only saving grace at this place as far as our experience went. The biscuits are heavy, dense, and dry but the butter and jam that is served along side is very good. We decided to give the food one last shot and ordered the Beignets, but again we were underwhelmed. If they had been served with the jam then maybe they would have been a little more impressive. \n\nService: The service was sparse and subpar to say the least. The Giants game was on at the bar and the entire staff spent most of the time watching the game. Getting their attention was a major challenge. It was so noticeable that the head chef even said something! The chef couldn't even see the entire staff watch the game from his viewpoint, but the fact that he noticed shows just how bad it was. He even told one of the waiters \"it is more important to feed the guests than watch the Giants game.\" AMEN! \n\nAtmosphere: Their take on the front porch atmosphere is how I imagine a run down house's front porch would look like with a ton of crap on it. The inside is decorated with an odd variety of items. The booths are the back seat of a car equipped with seat belts and they serve your food on an assortment of small plates and cafeteria trays, which is unique. We were seated back by the kitchen and it was uncomfortably hot!  \n\nOverall: This place receives a 2. This is one of the lowest Yelp review scores I have given but unfortunately it was earned. The service really lacked and the food was underwhelming. In a great foodie city like San Francisco there are so many wonderful options of places to eat and this is not one I would go back to. For the same price you could have a lovely meal in the neighborhood at Delfina or Flour+Water and have much better service, food, and overall value.", "author": "50 State By 30 T."}

The texture is slightly more doughy than what I remembered from Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans, but amazing in its own right. I ordered the classic chicken and waffles (you can ask for all dark meat, no extra charge) and the chicken was tender and juicy with a perfectly crusted skin, not too much breading. The waffles are tough and a bit dry, not enough moisture and texture.

The staff is really friendly and the decor has a southern homey feel. Our waitress was really helpful. One downside to this restaurant is the fact that all the fried foods are cooked in the same fryer. Meaning that anyone with a shellfish/seafood allergy is unable to try any of the menu items that are fried. I wanted to try the fried chicken (duh! southern yummy) and when I informed the waitress that I had a shellfish allergy, I was told that ALL of the fried foods are prepared in the same fryer which means 1/2 of their menu was no longer an option for me!! I understand the kitchen is small but there should be an option that does NOT exclude certain customers. \nI ordered the short rib with broccolini and the mac and cheese. The short rib was cooked very well; very tender and it fell apart. BUT - the mac and cheese was disappointing. It was cheesy but that's about it. The mac and cheese was bland. Another downside: Southern cooking uses seasonings and this didn't taste seasoned. \nMy friend had the blue crab hush puppies and the fried chicken (she doesn't have food allergies, lucky girl) w/garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens but was not impressed. She said the hush puppies were more corn meal tasting than blue crab. The fried chicken and collards were okay but needed more seasoning as well.\nOverall this restaurant is just okay and for the amount we spent per person, we should have been blown away!\nAgain, a major plus to our experience was our waitress!!

Going in at dinner time, I was able to sit at the bar without waiting. The food was all very well-assembled and presented, high in quality, and all exactly as described.\n\nThat said, let's talk about the food itself. I'm from the south, and was looking for some food that would remind me of home. I ordered the fried chicken dinner, which comes with greens and mashed potatoes, and an appetizer of deviled eggs. The food here suffers from what I'll call \"San Francitis\". There's such a pressure here for your food to be unique -- to have some hipstery/foodie gimmick -- that almost every dish has some kind of twist. In a tradition-driven comfort-food cuisine that reaches its greatest heights through simplicity, adding these twists can be a big risk. The deviled eggs, for example, have a dollop of jam on them; not a deal breaker in principle, but flavor-wise it completely doesn't work. The semi-tart sweetness of the jam overrides everything else in the savory egg. The main attraction is the chicken, and to be frank I am not a fan. The chicken is seasoned with lots of garlic. The chicken is pungent and almost spicy with garlic. It's not outright a bad flavor, but it's too intense. \"Garlic chicken\", the menu ought to say. Overall, it left me disappointed.\n\nI understand why it's like this; there are other places frying chicken in the city, and each one has to do something to set themselves apart. But I'm still looking for the place whose gimmick is simply that they fry it the best.", "author": "Jeremy C."}

We were headed to \"Good Frickin Chicken\", but thought it would be worthwhile to see how long the wait was at TFP since it's just down the block. We arrived at around 7:30 PM and was lucky enough to snag the last open table. \n\nFOOD:\n*Blue Crab Corn Fritters w/ Criolla Remoulade ($11): YUMMY! The fritters were lightly battered and fried to a dark golden fried; although a bit over fried for my taste. It was filled with sweet and tender blue crab shreds and crisp yellow corn kernels. The remoulade was creamy, tangy, sweet and savory from the mayo, pickles and Worcestershire sauce and the horseradish gave a slight zing and nose tingle.   \n\n*Fried Chicken w/ Mash potatoes and Collard greens ($16 for 3 pieces + $4.75 for an extra piece + $2 for all dark meat): The chicken's crust is very crispy and a bit on the thick side, yet it manages to not be greasy. The chicken is so moist and tender that as I took a bite into it, juices started to dribble down my chin--YUMS! It's already well-seasoned, but you can use their hot sauces (house and habanero) to add a fiery kick to the chicken. The mash potatoes were creamy w/ small chunks of potato for texture and had a hint of garlic flavor. But, the collards were a little too bitter for me. \n\n*Mac and Cheese ($6.50): OMG, if you love cheese, this is A MUST ORDER! Even w/o a breadcrumb topping, TFP's version has a gooey crunchy crust from the cheese that has broiled to a golden crisp in the oven. The elbow noodles are plump and al-dente and the b\u00e9chamel sauce is creamy, savory, and decadent. This served alongside w/ the fried chicken is an epitome of what Southern comfort food is in my book! \n\n*Biscuits for Boobies ($6 for 2; all proceeds got charity): It was good, although I normally like my biscuits light and flaky. TFP's biscuits are very hearty, dense, and buttery. Served w/ sweet cream butter which may clog an additional artery or two. \n\nSERVICE:\nIt was ok, although it can be improved. Our waitress was friendly, however she seemed very overwhelmed. It took about 10 minutes to order and then she pretty much disappeared from there. I didn't get my ice tea until after our app was served and we had to flag down food runners for our bill.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nRustic, funky, and cozy. Everything about TFP screams \"The Old South\"; from the wooden rocking chairs on the outdoor patio, potted plants, saloon style bar, and cute little porch chair ornaments scattered around the front bar area. LOVE IT!\n\nPARKING:\nTFP is located in Outer Mission where street parking is much easier to come by than around the Valencia and 16th Street area.\n\nIf you're looking for Southern comfort food that trumps Farmerbrown and 1300 on Fillmore (in a low-key environment) and that is a notch above Hard Knox, I highly suggest The Front Porch!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Found out about it on Triple D a few years ago. I've been hooked ever since. Real chill atmosphere,  great service.  I always sit at the bar. Bartenders are super cool and the music was good.I had a couple of their signature drinks and they all were really good. \n\nNow for the main event.....The CHICKEN. It's made fresh to order, they tell you it's going to take about 25 minutes for your order to be ready. When you get it it's hot and fresh, super crispy, and juicy. You get9 about 4 pieces or so. I usually don't finish them all. The mashed potatoes and greens are a great addition.  You literally will want to lick the crumbs off your plate it's really that good! \n\nI've also tried the macaroni and the shrimp and grits. They were alright. I would just say stick with the star of the show and you will not be disappointed.", "author": "Brittany B."}

Instead of frying the entire pickle, they slice them into thin chips and then fry them.  While I wouldn't have ordered this myself, I won't complain that my friend did.\n\nThe short ribs and vegan risotto cakes were quite good as well.

I know it's annoying when it's busy and people want to split the bill, but you are in food service and treating your customers like they are horrible little children is not acceptable.

Gary Denko was on the agenda for tonight, so we wanted something entirely different. We wanted something less precious than most Of the fare offered in San Francisco, so we decided on, what we thought would be, Southern cooking.  Mac and cheese, collard greens and fried chicken, what could be more Southern?\n\nWe were seated right away outside at a bar table.  Perfect size for drinks, our table was a whole twelve inches wide.  We immediately took off all the stuff that was on it and set it on the ledge next to us.  Since we knew what we wanted, we ordered quickly.  Mac and cheese, fried pickles, biscuits and the chicken plate.  We weren't asked if we wanted drinks, so we forgot to order them.  \n\nOut came the first item quickly enough, the biscuits.  \n\nReally. The biscuits?  Where were the pickles? \n\nThe biscuits were fine.  I have had better, and Lord knows, I have had worse. \n\nThen came... Two of the tiniest corn muffins I have seen.   I couldn't help wondering if I should eat mine or take it home to plant it to see if it would grow.  \n\nStill, no pickles.  \n\nThen, foot tapping silence.  \n\nThe waitress came and the hubby asked for soda. \n\nMore waiting.  Soda came.  \n\nThen the chicken plate with, you guessed it, the pickles.  \n\nThinly sliced, the pickles were not at all oily.  Nor did they have any flavor.  I wondered how dill pickles could be flavorless.   Had I liked the sauce, they might have been fine, but I didn't.  \n\nThe chicken was tender, crispy and not oily.  Nor did it have any flavor.   I was starting to see a trend.  \n\nThe mashed potatoes had less flavor than what one gets from a box and the collard greens,  with bacon, no less, had the same flaw.  \n\nI finished what I wanted of my husband's dinner and was ready to leave.  \n\nBut wait.   Do you see the problem here?\n\nYep. That is right.  \n\nWhere the heck is that long awaited Mac and cheese?\n\nI was full.

I have had fried pickles from dozens of places and these were by far the worst. \n\nThe service was also lack luster. She barely came by when she wasn't hanging out at the bar. My boyfriend drinks a lot of lemonade and she wasn't around to refill it ...ever.\n\nI would go back because the chicken was so delicious. If you live in the area, go here. If you live closer to the heart of the city, go to Farmer B's. The drinks weren't bad either!", "author": "Jazmyn W."}

Behind this modernly artless Front Porch up to 49 occupants (49--coincidence, alright), including one elongated table, & one triangulated-like wooden table that comfortably fits 8 epicures--i.e. us--can imbibe, cozy up & enliven the following Southern cuisine--and cocktail.\n\n-Porch Swing ($8)-\nThis alcoholic, citrus-y \"delight\" reminded me of both a margarita & upper-class mimosa, except that it's not champagne w/ a rim of salt.\n\n-Fried Pickles ($6)-\nI've munched them previously in a notorious restaurant (Hi, Slaters :P), & I LOVE these grease-eliminated, superbly battered, deep fried salties w/o much of the salty side.  I enjoyed the nice touch of Tabasco Aioli to dip, but I made it a bit more adventurous by liberally adding Front Porch's very tolerably spicy Habanero Sauce.\n\n-Sweet Potato Fries ($5)-\nExquisitely dense & tasty w/o trying so hard, I forgot about dipping these Vitamin A-rich fritters into the Creh-ole aioli.\n\n-Fried Okra ($6)-\nThe most extraordinary finding with this unexpectedly tantalizing fried veggie, going together with the jalape\u00f1o aioli, was that, if cooked wrong, you'd be faced w/ okra's naturally slimy mess.  Ahh, hallelujah to its absence xD.  Okra's one of my favorite veggies, & fried or otherwise, this appetizer's also a 5-star gem.\n\n-Biscuits (2 for $4)-\nOne word: Skip.\nTwo words: Had better.\n\n-Baked Merlitons ($11)-\nDon't know what a Merliton is?  I had no clue, either, until our Nicole Kidman look-and-sound-alike waitress expatiated that it's aka a Creole Chayote w/ numbers of ways to spell \"merliton,\" that had that consistency of squash.  But frankly they're not shabby yet the shrimp & crab mixin' could be way more impressive than the careful presentation.\n\n-Cornbread (FREE)-\nThat's Front Porch's bread & butter; I think I'll be fond of them if served caringly warm. \n\n-Baked Mac and Cheese ($6.75)-\nHere's the thing: I don't eat mac & cheese that often, but when I do, every single tryst of this Southern comfort food always leaves a memorable mark in my cranial nerves.  In this dinner, oh my YUM...cheesy without being too sharp or reticent, with some strings attached *hint hint* from the baked pasta, I'd give it a peerless 5.0 if the elbows were less soft.  Deng, now I gotta find an emulation of this in So Cal! x/\n\n...And the most prominent display of the porch was...\n\n-Bucket of Fried Chicken, Garlic Mashers w/ Gravy & Collard Greens w/ Bacon ($34)-\nUmmm, $34 for 10 of those cluckers?!  Popcorn--err, Rocky Jr.--Chicken 50x the size of normal, this fried meatiness was relevantly executed in a theatre popcorn bucket.  I generally prefer burgers to fried chicken, but no matter if it's drumstick or thigh, the consistently succulent meat & crispy skin were enigmatically delicious for using seemingly simple ingredients to build this edible masterpiece.  With the very creamy, slightly mushy yet tasty mashed potatoes & appetizing, baconized leaves alongside, the chicken has half a point, out of 5, taken off due to that price label (Think twice if you're actually considering getting 3 pieces for $17 ^_^).\n\nAll said & done, b/c of my unforeseen Yelp Bookmark I must come back to chill at The Front Porch for either brunch or for the noteworthy Beignets.  From the wow-inducing food, the required but appropriate 18% gratuity for our party of 8, & the bow-down patient & hospitable service from the redheaded Kidman doppelganger (i.e. Marcelle), it's 4 stars and nothing less, friends, and I wish you all a magnificent & fun-filled 2012 =D.", "author": "Fia R."}

They had a specific menu for the holidays and everything we tried was absolutely delicious. The shrimp and grits was AMAAAAZING. I tried to replicate the recipe at home because it was so good, but it's nice when someone else makes it for you and serves it up piping hot. Also had their herb rolls which were better than your standard bread and butter. The mac n cheese was also scrumptious. I think I am obsessed with mac n cheese in general and I've tried many versions, but this one is up there in the top 5. \n\nThe location BTW is great for going out for drinks if you like those hole in the wall bars.

Booked a reservation for brunch yesterday and the only negative thing I can say is that I'm super bummed I hadn't heard of it years ago! The ambience is hella cute and homey, the coffee cups are a mish mash of cute quips, which I loved. The menu...where do I start... I love southern comfort food, so my family & I thought ordering a few things & splitting it all family style would be best. We started out with beignets, which were hot and chewy, and covered in powdered sugar - to the point where if i exhaled while taking a bite....POOF sugar everywhere! Next, the biscuits & gravy - de-LISH! there was a hint of garlic, and the biscuits were crispy, yet soft, and not doughy. We ordered shrimp & grits, with an extra side of grits, cuz my 9 year old daughter can put away some grits... the flavor of the shrimp was amazing, with just the right amount of spice. Last out was the chicken & waffles and i swear the plate was glowing while angels sang 'Hallelujah' The chicken was cooked perfectly, moist and delicious inside, and the perfect exterior crunchiness with an awesome cajun kick. The waffle had chunks of bacon in it and was also perfectly cooked. I highly recommend The Front Porch for a delicious brunch and/or dinner. We perused the dinner menu, and are very excited to go back and try more of the foods!", "author": "Amy B."}

The show featured several restaurants, one of which was The Front Porch and their fried chicken.  I was very intrigued.  I quickly grabbed my laptop and went on Yelp to search for it.  Once  found, I sent the link to my hubby.  I was expecting some type of comment like \"Oh that sounds good\" or something of the sort.  Instead, he totally surprised me by saying there was a 6P opening for dinner on Valentine's day.  Wow. I guess he really wanted to try it out, so glad we did!\n\nWe came in early and there were only 2 tables seated when we got in.  I was a bit bummed that we were seated in the booth directly across from the kitchen door. Each time the door opened I kept feeling a cold draft.  I knew I'd have to order a glass of wine to warm up.  As the restaurant filed up, I didn't notice the draft as much (or may be it was the wine?) I do have to point out that  I loved the welcoming feel and ambiance.  I love restaurants like this one!\n\nI ordered the fried chicken and it did not disappoint!   It really lived up to the hype.  It was super yummy delicious. I couldn't stop eating it.   I would order it again and again. Best fried chicken dish I've ever ordered so far.   I did like the collard greens but I could take it or leave it on the mashed potatoes. A lot of it was left on my plate.  We totally loved the brussel sprouts! So glad the hubby ordered it. His entree was the shrimp and grits.  He polished the plate so I thought he really liked it, but he just told me the shrimp was a little over cooked.  At first we hesitated on ordering biscuits, but we decided to order it after we got our cornbread (we thought the cornbread portion would be bigger).  For dessert, we had the bread pudding, which was delightful.\n\nAll in all, we're definitely going back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-04-21", "description": "On Saturday, 4/19/14, my girlfriend and I ate at The Front Porch for dinner. We had very high expectations after reading the majority of the positive reviews on yelp.\n\nAtmosphere/Decor: \n\nThe restaurant is pretty small. It's located by a Safeway shopping center. I can see how someone could literally drive by The Front Porch and not even know it exists. When we walked up to the restaurant, there were a few dining tables located in front of the main entrance. Having outside dining is definitely a good idea especially in the summer or on a nice sunny day. \n\nIt's very dark inside the restaurant. There's a bar and enough seating for about 8 to 12 people. There were a few tables in the middle of the restaurant and dining booths. The restaurant is so small you can literally see the location of the kitchen and the bathrooms. Watch your step when you go to use the restroom. I almost tripped once I opened up the curtains to enter the restroom. You can easily stump your foot when you enter the restroom because there is a little curb that rises above the ground level. I felt like the Southern concept was off to me. I'm not from the South but the atmosphere/decor is kind of tacky. \n\nFood:\n\nWe started off with the baked mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was pretty good. My girlfriend liked it a lot. She said it was one of the better mac and cheeses shes had. I like it a lot as well but there was a little too much pepper. In my opinion mac and cheese isn't supposed to taste like pepper. \n\nI ordered the fried chicken for my main entree. I really didn't understand the red plastic eating tray. I mean who serves fried chicken, collard ham hog greens, mashed potatoes & gravy along with popcorn on a plastic eating tray? It reminded my of an elementary school eating tray. It was hard to eat the chicken because the tray spaces weren't that big. There was literally no room. The fried chicken was decent. I don't think it's one of the best fried chickens. The mashed potatoes and gravy were really good. The ham hog collard greens weren't good at all. And where the heck was the ham hogs? I didn't have a single piece of ham in my collard greens. I wonder why?  Maybe they forgot? Oh yeah, and what the heck is up with the popcorn? We're not at a carnival. This is a restaurant. I feel like the popcorn has no business being on that tray. Now if it were little deep fried chicken nuggets or little pieces of deep fried chicken shaped into a small ball, that would work. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Dr. Pepper Short ribs. I got excited when I heard about a short rib being infused with Dr. Pepper! But it wasn't that good! Dang it!!! The taste was different. It was more like a pot roast then a short rib. Good short ribs are supposed to be super tender. The Dr. Pepper Short ribs were tender but not melt in your mouth tender. I couldn't really taste the Dr. Pepper either. My girlfriend pointed out that the whole meal tasted like collard greens. The collard greens were placed directly on top of the mashed potatoes then the Short rib was placed on top of the collard greens. My girlfriend was right, everything tasted like collard greens which wasn't a good thing. \n\nService:\n\nThe service was good. What stood out to me the most about the service was every waiter and waitress seemed like a team player. There were a few times when our waiter was busy waiting on other tables and a waitress came by and filled up our water. She even took my credit card from me once our waiter dropped off the bill. \n\nOverall:\n\nThe Front Porch is a decent restaurant. If you want better fried chicken visit Wayfare Tavern. Tyler Florence definitely knows what he is doing when it comes to fried chicken. At Wayfare Tavern you also have the option of ordering all white meat chicken or mixed with dark meat. If you think these short ribs are good you should visit Lark Creek Steak and order the pre-fix pot roast dinner or go to Paragon. Paragon's pot roast blows The Front Porch's Dr. Pepper Short ribs out the water as well. It's very good!

Once again, the batter and fry technique were spot on.  Thin and crisp, and amazingly not greasy! I didn't feel like I was going to have a heart attack when eating this.  However, the flavor was lacking.  I felt it was way under-seasoned.

It comes served in a popcorn bucket surrounded by popcorn.  Now here's my theory, the popcorn soaks up all the oils, thus leaving the chicken batter with the crispiest skin I've ever had!  I cannot rave enough about this chicken and have referred several of my friends to try it as well.\n\nCornbread- medallion sized mini cornbread was served on the house along with a Cajun flavored butter, quite good\n\nFucket get a Bucket - habanero hot sauce, the best thing ever!

That said, the cocktail I had was awesome, as were the blue crab hush puppies and fried okra appetizers.  You can sit outside on a cold night because there are heaters, and it's rather fun being right on the street.  For the last few items I mentioned, that's why I'm rating 3 stars and not 2.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-31", "description": "3.5 stars. Good Southern eats are alive in SF thanks to The Front Porch (which Rocks BTW). We had a great sampling of their bucket of chicken, collards, mashed potatoes and gravy, boiled peanuts, and fried okra and fried pickles.\n\nWe walked past a few rocking chairs on the front porch into the previously mentioned rather dark interiors of this restaurant. We were promptly seated (thanks Open Table for the highly recommended reservations) and were promptly served from there on out by a very friendly and efficient waitress.\n\nThe verdict: the food ranged from just OK to excellent.\n\nBoiled Peanuts: a large appetizer that you really have to like in order to appreciate. Boiled peanuts are not particularly attractive, rather dark and grey served steaming hot in a paper bag. If you can't get past the look or texture, then this is not for you. I liked them OK, but this was not something I'll re-order.\n\nFried Okra: I think these were too overdone to be perfect. They got stringy at the ends and there was not a great contrast between the insides and the crunchy outsides. I did like the dipping sauce that was provided.\n\nFried Pickles: Interesting and overall successful with the dipping sauce. Not soggy or particularly flavored one way or another. \n\nTHE Fried Chicken: A set of very juicy pieces thickly breaded with a very crunchy corn meal coating. Not particularly spicy (OK not spicy at all) and some may fault the chicken for being bland, but I really enjoyed it. This is not Popeye's style spicy chicken; if that's what you expecting, go elsewhere. But (Front Porch) that would be a really nice idea to provide a spicy version of this already great chicken.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were perfection but not many of the our table liked the collards, which was judged to be too sour.\n\nDeserts were off the hook. The brioche bread pudding was like tiramisu meets carrot cake meets cinnamon bread pudding. The banana cream pie was cleverly presented and very delicious. \"Just like homemade\" was often heard.\n\nThis came out to about $40 per couple, so this was moderate to high for this style of food. I did very much like the service and the food. But the darkness and the rather high prices for the food (which was uneven in quality) brought the value down some.", "author": "Glenn H."}

I first had it during dinner, which runs north of $30 for a bucket. It feels kind of weird to be paying $30+ for a bucket of fried chicken, but if you're a fried chicken glutton like me, it's worth the price. A great alternative I do to get my fried chicken fix for cheaper is to come during weekend brunch, where they serve chicken and waffles for $14. As an FYI, it takes 25 minutes for them to prepare it, but that's because they make it to order. Having freshly fried chicken brought straight to your table... so good!\n\nI've also tried a few other things on their menu. The beignets are fresh, and I would recommend those as well. I would actually recommend AGAINST getting the chicken fried steak and mac and cheese, which I'd actually rate below average. The fried chicken I rate a solid 5 stars, which brings me to my 4 star rating for this place.", "author": "Morris C."}

Don't get me wrong the fried chicken was delicious. Very flavorful and crunchy but I felt the mac and cheese was a little bleh and not as good as everyone had been raving about. I was also turned off by how loud it was when we came in for dinner. We stopped in around 8:30PM on a Saturday night and were sat right near the bar. It was super loud and I could barely hear myself talk. I wasn't expecting a super fancy quiet dinner but I wasn't expecting a rowdy bar crowd while I'm trying to eat dinner either. \n\nOverall the establishment was cute but I felt like it was a little 'cave-like' inside and the tables were too small.

We pass by this place all the time so I figured might as well try it. It looks chill and the price has two dollar signs- so average, right? Wrong. This place is too pricey for the actual food. I guess if you're a hipster and like the thrifty look for a high price, then go ahead, it's your scene. The place looks small and dingy from the outside and inside was a normal small restaurant with a bar. Our baby carseat couldn't fit in the booth so we put it in the high chair and hoped it wouldn't get in anyone's way.\n\nSo I guess you have to make reservations here bc it's usually packed. Why? As my bf put it, \"I don't understand the hype.\" we got here at exactly 5:30 right when they opened for dinner so we were lucky to be seated. The waitress asked if we could stay only up till 7pm bc the tables are all reserved already. Whatever, that's fine. I guess we couldn't sit and relax after dinner if we wanted to. But I didn't want to anyway bc the food wasn't even that enjoyable. You know when you're hungry, everything is usually really good??? Not here. I ordered the chicken and mashed potatoes with the side of mac and cheese. Per the waitress, \"The chicken is what they are famous for.\" why? When it came, there were 4 small to average size pieces and I only ate one and gave the rest to my bf. he said they were just okay, but didn't want to waste it bc it was 15 bucks. The greens and mashed potatoes weren't anything special. I feel like I would have enjoyed this at KFC more bc it's cheaper but at least KFC has that buttery taste to their mashed potatoes. Anyway, the Mac and cheese wasn't bad. It was super cheesy, and really hot. I filled up on that only bc I was hungry and it was decent. My boyfriend got the shrimp and grits. He said it was ok but for it to be 23 bucks or so, not worth it AT ALL. Dude, the bill came out to be 65 bucks (with tip) oh and I ordered a coke (no refills on that bc it came in a can). What a rip off! I don't know how it came to be so much with just 3 average items and all I wanted was chicken and waffles, and couldn't even get that. \n\nThe only reason why I gave it a 2 star and not 1 was because the waitress was pretty nice.

It's supposed to be a southern restaurant and southern hospitality is a thing, no? I think it's kind of a kitsch hipster idea of a southern restaurant--the fried chicken served in a bucket, the mismatched furniture, the rocking chairs. Underneath these stylistic flourishes is just like a very cold, SF, hipster place with a punk edge. That's ok in a dive bar, but not really what I want from a restaurant where my entree was $25. \n\nI was in the neighborhood and called to see if they had tables for in 10-20 minutes, and the hostess said yes there were open tables and to walk on over. But she also confusingly said, when you get here, you can put your name on the list. When I got there, there were no tables, and we were given the option to sit at the bar, which we did (why didn't she reserve us a table when I called if she knew how busy they generally are?). The place I was seated was at the very end of the bar directly in front of where the drink orders are placed on a rubber mat--not a place to sit and eat anything more than bar snacks. The restaurant acoustics are also designed for roaring din. Since I wanted to have a quieter conversation with my friend, we asked if we could just have drinks and apps at the bar and be moved to an outdoor table when one opened up. The hostess was visibly annoyed by the request, though she did honor it. Yes, I understand it was an annoying request, but I would have appreciated the eye roll coming AFTER I turned my back. I could see the restaurant was really slammed and all the staff were working super hard, but that meant things happened like...no silverware or napkins til 10 minutes after we got our food, requests for water that was never delivered. Most of the service we did get was not from our waitress, it was from a very hard working guy who I suppose might be called a busser? He brought the bread, he brought the water, he cleared the dishes, he asked if we were doing ok. I hope he gets a good cut of the tips because he seems to carry the show! I think I only saw the waitress twice-once when she took the order and once with the bill. And honestly, she seemed snarly and I would have felt very uncomfortable asking her for anything. The whole experience made my normally laid-back friend super tense and unhappy, which is kind of the opposite feeling you want from a restaurant. \n\nAs far as the food, I got the Dr. Pepper braised beef short ribs and they were dry and tough, but the sides were great.

Safe to say, it was a good time for all. \n\nTFP is what was a garage/ground level duplex turned restaurant. This makes for a relatively low ceiling and a very homey feel. Cozy. Crowded ... But not too crowded with tables and chairs and all. Very easy to navigate inside the place without knocking into people's chairs and tables. As far as ambiance goes, I'd say the music was just a tad too loud for my taste. I had trouble hearing the person sitting two chairs to my side. That said, they were playing some hip tunes. \n\nService was quick and friendly. They take reservations which is a plus. Needless to say, if you're planning on going during peak operating hours, consider making a reservation to minimize or eliminate wait time. \n\nThe fare is priced a bit more than I would have expected, but I suppose it's justified given their rent is probably close to astronomical. I'd say $11-15 gets you a nice plate. I got the 2 egg/biscuit/bacon/grits combo. Everything was pretty solid. Not mind blowing, but above average (in my opinion of course). I especially enjoyed the biscuit and the grits; just the right flakiness level, and just the right amount of cheese respectively. \n\nWas it good? Certainly. \nWould I go back? Maybe if I was in the neighborhood. \nThe best? Probably not ... Gets a bit more hype than I would deem worthy. \n\nI am not saying I wouldn't recommend.

I came in early because I really needed to use the restroom, so I told the hostess about my reservation and asked if I can have access to the restroom beforehand. She said absolutely! And told me that when everyone arrives, she can seat us early. This was the start of my 5 stars.\n\nWe ordered the seasonal storm as the alcoholic beverage of choice, and man were they delicious. For food, we ordered the fried pickles, the bacon wrapped dates, the blue crab hush puppies, and the main entr\u00e9e of the four piece chicken with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy and collards. The appetizers were soooo bomb. The pickles and the hush puppies were fried goodness, but surprisingly my favorite was the bacon wrapped dates. The bacon was thick and crunchy, while the dates were adequately soft and sweet. Not to forget that the dates had cheese stuffed in them, so the combination of flavors made my taste buds really freak out with amused excitement. The mash was a not too thick or too thin and the gravy wasn't slathered excessively over it, so I could taste the butter and the potatoes with a few tiny chucks, which I appreciated. The greens had the hit of tangy sweetness, which one of my friends didn't really like, but I thought was a good balance with the mash. The fried chicken was just ok. The skin tasted a little over cooked and I kept biting into the chicken thinking that some kind of seasoning was missing. My friend said the same thing after she tried hers. My other friends really liked theirs, so I just added some hot sauce on mine and it was good to go.\n\nBy the end, we were completely stuffed and wanted to cry a little because they handed us the dessert menu and we really wanted to try them, but we just had no more room.\n\nThe staff was courteous and came to check on us a good amount of times. They didn't take long to take our orders and told us the chicken would take 20 minutes to fry. We left happy and satisfied, which is why they get 5 stars.", "author": "Pamela B."}

Finally found a place that does it right. The Dr. Pepper short ribs were fine but nothing too memorable and the mac and cheese the same. \n\nOverall, I only gave this spot 3 stars because the menu was over priced and the service was a little lacking.

The chicken breast felt a little dry, but the chicken itself was soft. \n\nMac n cheese: It was yummy at the time, but haven't had Fat Angel's Mac n cheese, Fat Angel wins for being cheesier. At FP the Mac n cheese is baked, so the cheese is harder. Still one of my gm favorite things here.\n\nBraised rib: Another favorite. Huge portions and enough to share with 8 people. It was tender and fell off the bone.\n\nBiscuits: Where is the biscuit gravy? It tasted a little different here... maybe because I had Pine State in Portland and it's forever changed my palette on what a biscuit should be. Also, it was a little hard.\n\nCream of corn: Expected soup, and it came out like an entree. There should have been more liquid, and I think that's what everyone was expecting... to eat with a spoon, but you only needed a fork.\n\nDeviled eggs: Delicious at any juncture. I love deviled eggs. That bacon on top made it good!\n\nPork chop: Also huge portions, so good to share. It was a great pork chop, and if you normally like pork chop you will probably like it. Pork chop meat is a little too tough for me, but I'll still eat it. \n\nThe dessert we got was in a mason jar with chocolate mousse, marshmallow, etc. It was unique and flavorful, and great to share!", "author": "Jeanne C."}

It's cute and ramshackle inside and the staff are so friendly and happy, there's a nice little porch area with heaters outside and rocking chairs. Unfortunately the food was just not good. We ordered the crawfish etouffee and it tasted very fishy - like off fishy. Maybe it's meant to be like that but it was very off-putting. The main dishes were pretty underwhelming for the price - $25 for the braised short rib, which was a big portion but the beef was very dry and the gravy very salty. My husband had the flounder ($22 I think), which was good but nothing to write home about - again the portion was big, so that's something. \n\nIt seemed like this place was more about the fried chicken and cocktails and atmosphere than really good food.", "author": "Y A."}

The crawfish hush puppies were super delicious, served with three different kinds of hot sauce: one mild and red, one mild and green, and one habanero. The spicy shrimp with grits are everything they're cracked up to be in the other reviews here: juicy, succulent shrimp (I'm guessing they are real Gulf shrimp) like you don't usually get in SF with a wonderful balance of flavors. And the only word to describe the fried chicken is PERFECT, worth writing home about, served with garlic mashed potatoes covered with gravy and a side of collard greens.

However, Front Porch makes me overlook that because it is GOOD enough to gain 10 pounds for!!!\n\nCame here on Saturday afternoon for lunch. I sat outside, which was fine, but the inside was really cramped, dark, and just super divey and janky looking. Tried the beignets, mac n cheese, chicken n waffles, and sweet potato pulled pork hash. Beignets were meh, but the other stuff tasted great! Mac n cheese was hot and creamy, but not overloaded on cheese (just how I like it). Chicken and waffles were delicious--the waffle had a bacon flavor to it and the chicken was lightly breaded, not greasy, and fried to perfection! The sweet potato hash was a interesting combination, nonetheless still good. I liked the fusion of the sweetness of the sweet potatoes and the savory taste of the pulled pork and bell peppers. Everything was priced around $10 - $18 ish.\n\nService was a little slow--no one came out to take our order so I had walk up to the waitress inside to tell her what I wanted, hence minus one star.

Knowing that it was a Friday night and we didn't get reservations, we were happily surprised that the hostess told us it'd be a 45 minute wait for a table at 715pm. Score! \n\nWe were able to get seats at the bar, but decided to hold off on eating at the bar since our table was coming soon. 45 minutes passed, and no table...1 hour passed, and no table. At this point we were getting really hungry and contemplating just getting food at the bar. We flagged down the hostess and she said that we were the 1st in line to get the next table. Ok, not so bad, we can hold off for a few more minutes. 1.5 hours passed and still no table, but our hopes were high since we noticed that the patrons at the tables were getting their checks. But too our dismay, once the patrons left, the hostess didn't seat us, and instead seated other couples. We flagged her down once again to ask about the situation, she said that the those tables were for the reservations....so why did you tell us we're 1st in line to get a table HALF an hour ago?! \n\nTrying to stay calm, I asked her how long the wait would be and her reply was...drum roll please...\"I have no clue, could be another 30-45 minute wait. Why don't you guys just order food at the bar\". WTFFFFFF!!! At this time, steam was coming out of my ears! Obviously we wanted a table or else we would have eaten at the bar an hour ago!! \n\nEven though my stomach was crying out for attention and my head was spinning because of starvation, my husband and I decided that we rather take the risk of waiting at another restaurant than waste our money at The Front Porch. We paid for our drinks, gave the bartender a good tip, and hastily left, never to return. \n\nAt least I can thank The Front Porch for one thing that night, and that was introducing us to Contigo (great Spanish tapas place). \n\nTip to the restaurant: Train your hostess better. The hostess should always over estimate wait times rather than under estimating. The ladder will leave you with hungry and pissed off customers (or ex customers in our case). Also, train them to be more attentive. When we walked out the restaurants, there were seating available outside the patio. NOT ONCE did she offer the choice to be seated outside.

My neighborhood landmark is Mitchell's Ice Cream, just a short block or so away.  The parking is not too bad during the day as there are residential and metered spaces.\nLove the wallpaper/vinyl design and booth; definitely an old school feel.  On weekends, there is live music during the day, which makes it difficult for conversations when dining.  It's slightly better at the three tables closer to the kitchen upstairs.\nTried the following:\n\na) Pulled Pork Sandwich - Great lunch or snacking item that's available in large and small sizes.  The slaw is a great mix with the tender shredded pork and extra barbecue sauce is given.\nb) Gumbo - Thick, chunky, and flavorful\nc) Chicken and Waffles - The star of the show in my eyes.  Piping hot, the waitress told us about the twenty minute wait, which was well worth it.\nd) Mac N Cheese (side dish) - Creamy rich, but like mine a little more crusty on top.\n\nWeekdays are probably the best time to dine here to avoid lines and crowds.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-27", "description": "Disclaimer: This is my first experience with southern food but I came here with a friend who has frequented numerous southern food restaurants in socal.\n\nParty: 3\nTime: Monday evening, around 6. \nWait: None\nFood: Corn bread (complimentary), Crawfish Hushpuppies, Biscuits, Baked Mac n cheese (x2), bucket of fried chicken\nService (5/5)\nThey were great! We had trouble deciding what to get and they very patient with us. They frequently checked on us. \n\nCornbread (1/5)\nThey were in fact mini corn muffins, which were cute but not good. Because they were so small, the outer layers were dry and a bit rubbery. The inside was dry and didn't have that mealy texture that I normally experience with corn bread. \nOverall, meh. \n\nCrawfish Hushpuppies with spicy remoulade sauce (3/5)\nFirst time eating hushpuppies. First bite, no sauce: it was good! It was flavorful and had a good balance of crispiness from the skin and the softness of the inside layer. But as I kept taking bites, the harder it was for me to enjoy the hushpuppies because it got bland really fast and the soft and some-what dry texture of the inside layer made it hard to swallow. So I decided to use the sauce. Again, sauce tasted great with the hushpuppies but it overpowered the taste of the hushpuppies.  Using the sauce, it sorta became eating sauce with hushpuppies much like dipping tortilla chips in salsa or pico. Lastly, I ordered this dish under thinking that it would have a creamy center much like some of the pictures posted but all 4 pieces were dry in the middle. Kinda disappointing. \nOverall, the dish is great but only in moderation.\n\nBiscuits (1/5)\nI'm going to be straightforward: I did not like them at all. They were hard and dry and didn't taste like a stereotypical biscuit (soft and buttery and so on). It felt more like I was eating a European biscuit with jam and butter. \nOverall, meh. \n\nBaked Mac n Cheese (4.5/5)\nMy friend and I both thought the mac n cheese was delicious! They shell pasta was neatly covered with cheese with a good stretchy layer of cheese on top. The shell pasta was a bit overcooked but I thought it balanced well with the soft creamy layer of cheese. However, there was something about it that made it really heavy as we kept eating it and we both felt that it was too much, even before starting the second order of mac n cheese. \nOverall, the dish is solid and you should get it!\n\nBucket of fried chicken (3/5)\nI don't remember the distribution of the pieces but I do remember there being 2 drumsticks and some wing and breast pieces. The chicken is freshly fried and so take caution with the first bite! The skin of the chicken was something we all enjoyed: it was flavorful with a good crunch. However, the meat of the chicken could use some flavor. The meat of the chicken was quite bland and some of the pieces were a bit dry (breast pieces). Also, the breast pieces were more like a single big breast cut into 3-4 pieces and spiced and fried and added to the bucket of 10. So, the bucket of chicken was not a bucket of 10 whole pieces of chicken that you normally get from, say, popeyes. \nOverall, it's okay and more on the mediocre side. Not the best fried chicken any of us had had.\n\nOverall, we thought that this place is okay. Not something I would go out of the way for and isn't really anything special. We all thought that the meal was a bit too expensive for what you are getting.

It seemed as though they tried really hard with that butter when all good cornbread needs is good ol' plain butter.\n    We ordered their shrimp n grits and the Dr. Pepper short ribs. The short ribs were SUCH a disappointment!!!!! For SOME reason the flavor was not there, AT ALL! Very surprising. The only thing they did right was make them tender. It was on a bed of mash that again was NOT properly seasoned and some green leaf veggies. I'm a veggie head and LOVE green veggies and they weren't very good either. The dish was a pretty epic fail, especially for being as hyped up as this dish was on t.v.\n     The shrimp n grits were a COMPLETE 180 from the ribs!!! Absolutely amazing! I was sooooo surprised my grandmother wasn't back there making the grits! They were perfect. Absolutely creamy and buttery. And the shrimp, OMG! They were seasoned well, a good size, juicy, and wild, from the gulf I think. And for a southern girl, that earthiness from the gulf gave the shrimp great flavor. Hats off to the chef for the entire dish, including the sauce that came on top with the shrimp. Its a about $25.00 (average price for the main dishes). I wish the serving was bigger, and it's not because in greedy, it was just a bit small. It's a cheap dish to make, so they should give a bit more.\n     The atmosphere is casual, and the service is friendly and laid back. The stars for this place however lie soley in them shrimp n grits honey! It's magnificent! I wanna go back to try their other stuff, AND have the grits again. The shrimp n grits are so good I crave them! The fried chicken looked great with a wonderful scaled and I'm anxious to see if the flavor is there. To be continued.....", "author": "Samantha J."}

And with a good looking po'boy menu and more, I was so excited to try this place! \n\nThere was a decent wait (about 30 mins) outside and I overheard two patrons speaking highly of their chicken and waffles. I didn't intend on having this but now my mouth was watering in anticipation of a nice flavorfully breaded piece of chicken and crunchy yet chewy waffle topped with a just right sweetened syrup - not too maple-y.  \n\nIt's a great menu with lots to choose from. I started to get confused. My dining companion was going to get the chicken and waffles so I thought I might try something else. In the end, my tastebuds were directing me to the c & w, and I decided I didn't want to be disappointed if I didn't get what I truly wanted. So we ended up with two c&w and a 6\" oyster po'boy to try it out. It also came with french fries.\n\nThat oyster po'boy was a winner! I'd definitely get that again! Perfectly seasoned and coated batter and not to the point that the batter overpowered the oysters. We threw on some hot sauce which made it even better! After this sampling, I was ready for more and figured the c&w would be just as good.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't share the same enthusiasm with the c&w. It comes in a big bowl with three pieces of chicken atop a waffle. I almost wish they used the same seasoning to batter the chicken but it wasn't the same. It just didn't bring out the flavor of the chicken despite the fact that they were juicy pieces. The waffle, though for the most part good, was a bit soggy since it sat underneath the chicken. Delicious syrup though. Not to sweet and definitely not maple-y.\n\nSo all in all, even though I was let down with the c&w, I would definitely dine here again. There are so many other menu selections that I'd love to try like their muffaleta, other po'boys and shrimp with grits. The service was good but it was a busy Sunday so our server was pretty pre-occupied. But the host (who could perhaps be the owner) was friendly and warm and sat patrons while his little girl was in his arms. Nice down home feeling. Great restaurant vibe.", "author": "Anna R."}

We got a bucket for $33 and it could easily feed three people, maybe even four if you are not large eaters though you'd definitely need an extra order of the side of chards and mashed potatoes. The chicken batter crust was very well seasoned and crispy while the meat was tender and juicy with the spices having permeated the meat deep inside --- I am pretty sure it was well marinated in the buttermilk for a fair amount of time. This dish alone deserves a 5 stars rating!!! The mashed potatoes were creamy and silky and I wouldn't hesitate to relabel it whipped potatoes. The chards had the right amount of, I am guessing, vinegar and that little sour taste offset the chicken and potatoes very very well!\n\nK had the shrimps and grits of which I got a spoon full and I have to admit they were awesome too. I would love to have it the next time I am there but I fear I will cave in to the call of the fried chicken instead.\nI. must. be. strong.\n\nFor dessert, the beignets were good but below my expectation and chocolate sauce was too little. For something similar, the house donuts with Godiva chocolate sauce at ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/ottimista-enoteca-cafe-san-francisco#hrid:UBbVwIFc0DNrzANda2glwg ) at ottimista-enoteca is unbeatable. \n\nThe mud pie too was disappointing as it was dry and not moist as one would expect.\n\nIncluding a drink, it was a bit on the expensive side at $35/person (incl tax and tips)", "author": "Umesh T."}

Another one marked off my list!!\nI was the first of my group of 10 to arrive for our reservation on a Sunday morning so I enjoyed the sunshine on one of the benches outside of the restaurant.  All of the other diners were late (tick tock tick tock - apparently they are all on a different time zone!) and finally the restaurant called asking if we were coming.  I proceeded inside to claim our table and waited ... and waited ... and waited for the rest of my group.  They started arriving 10+ minutes after I sat down and continued to arrive two-by-two in 15 minute intervals.  The point is, the staff was great about keeping our reservation and working with us throughout our dining experience.\n\nNow on to the good stuff .... oh the good stuff it is!!  We started out with beignets, mac and cheese, and biscuits and sausage gravy.  The mac and cheese and biscuits were AMAZING!!  I could just taste the love and butter in them both!  The beignets ... not so good.  Way too dense and too hot (yes, I am complaining about fried dough being too hot) - nothing like what you would get in NOLA.\n\nFor the main course, I think we tried one of everything and I am not sure what my favorite was.  I ordered the shrimp and grits with red-eye gravy - let's just say I cannot stop thinking about them and it has been four days.  Really, really good!  I am a sucker for grits and for shrimp, and for Andouille sausage.  Seriously, so good!  \n\nWe also ordered: catfish po' boy (good but a bit too much mayo for me), chicken and waffles (waffles are more like a cornbread with jalape\u00f1os and bacon!)  - YUM!!!, Eggs benedict - another YUM!, and the Stoner ... yeah, she was hung-over!  Everything we ordered was so good!  However, one of the diners was disappointed that dates with bacon was not on the menu when we dined - maybe next time!\n\nI will definitely be coming back to this place!

Took my partner for his birthday dinner last night and everything was up to par except for the hostess. A somewhat overweight white woman with dark hair pulled back must've had a really bad day. I observed her barking at customers already seated before she asked me if we had a reservation. She then told me in a very gruff manner to wait outside and she call me when my table was ready. Meanwhile I had received a text saying my table was ready. I observed 3 four tops available for seating. I also observed other four tops with only a party of two at the table. When I asked  her why we were waiting she said because you're waiting for a two top. Finally after 15 minutes went by I insisted that she Seat us at one of the available four tops. She could see the look in my eyes and tell that I was not going to take no for an answer so she complied. It just created a bad vibe despite our delightful server and the delicious food. A message to the hostess, if you don't like your job find another one save your attitude for someone that will take it.

Never once have I been disappointed with their fried chicken.\n\nI love fried chicken and especially after an infuriating experience at Little Skillet that has left me boycotting that place, The Front Porch is now my sole go-to place to get my fried chicken fix.  Today I was able to experience the amazingness that is chicken n waffles.  Since it was clearly stated on the menu, I was more than happy to wait 25 min to ensure that my chicken would be freshly fried.  I ended up getting 2 thighs and a wing -- would've preferred to have some breast meat, but since these aren't mutant KFC chickens, the thighs weren't overly fatty and were actually edible.  The chicken was super juicy and piping hot, the batter was perfect, and the meat could easily be removed from the bone with a fork and butter knife.  When I took a bite of the juicy meat, crispy skin, crisp on the outside/soft on the inside waffle, melted butter, and real maple syrup, I was in heaven.\n\nThat said, I did try a biscuit and it was a bit too crispy and dense for my taste, as I prefer the lighter, fluffier biscuits.  Moral of the story: stick with the fried chicken!!\n\nI also totally dig the decor -- the booths in the back are refurbished car seats, with seat belts and all!

We reckoned we deserved some down-home vittles after a hard day taggin' dead bodies (OK...crash test dummies) and extinguishin' fires. I was hearin' that Front Porch had the best fried chicken in the city, dang nab-it, so me and ol' Jamie went n' ordered two platefuls.

It was sorta like eatin' paste. Even Ellie Mae coulda done better in the kitchen. Just as we were gonna start to whittle some wood, the waiter came with the $14.75 Miss Ollie's Fried Chicken. It was a big ol' dish with some mac n' cheese, collard greens and black-eyed peas.\n\nNow it was so dark in here that I started to pick up a piece o' chicken with my hands. I was thinkin' that it was awful bready, and then I was wonderin' where the chicken was. It took me pert near ten bites before I realized I picked up the mac n' cheese. I felt dumber than Jethro Bodine at a Mensa meeting. The God's-honest truth was that the chicken was OK but not what Granny used to cook in our shed back in the hills.\n\nMe n' ol' Jamie had us some $6 Champagne Cocktails with sekt to wet our whistles. Mmmm..it was sweeter than the moonshine on a pig's bottom. Boy howdy, we was thinkin' we'd go through the drive-thru window at Popeye's after supper, but it was so gosh-darn dark that we figured we'd go huntin' for some chickens since we was in the Mission anyways.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...fried chicken with the fixins\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...boy howdy, it was darker than Bill O' Reilly's soul\nSERVICE - 4 stars...the staff were nicer than a opossum in a pot of Granny's hominy grits\nTOTAL - 3 stars...\"Y'all come back now, ya hear!\"...yes, I heard you", "author": "Ed U."}

When we get there it's pretty obvious that it's the converted garage of a victorian.  It's a tight squeeze but they did a nice job.\n\nSo we started off with the deviled eggs with jalapenos and bacon.  Yeah I like deviled eggs, but the added components really added a nice flavor to it.  Is it worth the price?  I guess it depends on how much you like deviled eggs already.  I thought they were great.\n\nThen we got the fried chicken with side orders of greens and bacon and mac n' cheese.  I loved it all.  The greens weren't overly bitter and had a good hint of brown sugar kind of flavor.  The mac n' cheese was heavy on the cheese.  It didn't have the crusted top my girlfriend likes, but she didn't seem to care.  The chicken had a ton of seasoning in the batter they used, and it wasn't overly greasy to the point where it's hard to hold it like we see with some \"southern\" inspired restaurants.\n\nOnly reason I'd give it a 4 and not a 5 star rating?

Good booze level, the bacon crumble at the top could do with a revamp, use real ground/powdered bacon instead of the crispy salad toppings they use and the pickled okra instead of celery or long beans was different but not fully appreciated by this okra hater but not a major issue for me, I just sidelined it and went on.  We started with the beignets & a side of maple bacon.  I promptly stuck a slice of bacon in my BM! The beignets were very tasty and the bacon was done just right, not stiff or hard but cooked well and still soft.  Now about the menu... do not look for anything classic, this is a change from just eggs & hash browns so be prepared to try new things & combinations.  The most classic thing you will find is chicken fried steak and the chicken & waffles, everything else is new.  I dove in with the spicy shrimp with andouille sausage with cheesy grits with a red sauce and converted the poached egg to scrambled.  And it was goooooood.  The grits were smooth, creamy and cheesy, the scrambled egg fit in quiet nicely and the shrimp & sausage had just the right spice and the red sauce just brought it all together. A second bloody mary was in order.  Now about the restaurant it self, small, dark and crowded.  Not bad as it is a small neighborhood eatery but the bar greets you at the front door and so does the swampy odor.  Having been a bartender before I can state with certainty, the bar needs some better swamping after hours, mats, wells & fixtures as well as the floor drains need some work.  Don't get me wrong, the place is clean it's just that bars because of spills get dirty and need a little extra care just like grease traps in the kitchens, and when your bar is literally at the front door greeting the public it better smell clean and fresh.  The Chef Jodi (sp)  & staff rocks a good meal, our waitress Mychel (Michelle) gave excellent service and was very attentive.

Her dish came in a small skillet, and much to her surprise, even though she was sold on the dish through the \"bacon crack,\" it was probably one slice of bacon, crumbled over the dish.  :-/  That was pretty mediocre.  My sandwich was nothing special.  Robert thought the sauce on it was too spicy, but he kept eating it, so it got the approval of a toddler!  I doubt we'd come back here.", "author": "ROB L."}

Apparently reservations are highly recommended, but we were fine since we arrived early. The restaurant was small, as it was located in what appeared to be a house--hence The Front Porch name. The menu was brief, with a few starters, main dishes, and sides. Their menu was a little frustrating, because they only had two offerings of chicken--their four piece combo and a nine piece bucket; nothing in between. We went with an order of the jalape\u00f1o and bacon deviled eggs, gumbo, and an order of their four piece chicken combo, which included mashed potatoes and collard greens. I thought the food overall was just average. The gumbo was flavorful and authentic; however, the fried chicken was not as special as I had anticipated. It was extra crispy and juicy, but extremely bland--I guess that's where their house hot sauces come in handy. \n\nCustomer service was friendly and attentive and prices were fair.

Went on Yelp while on the road, trying to decide what to have for dinner.  My fianc\u00e9 then said, \"I wish they had a Roscoe's out here.\"   So I searched for \"Fried Chicken,\" and after reading reviews on many locations we ended up here.  So, I will start off by saying Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles has nothing on The Front Porch.  The Front Porch over exceeds in all aspects, food, service, and drinks.   We did not have a reservation and therefore encountered a wait, but were kindly told we could go across the street to the bar and have a drink, and they would call us once our table was ready.  They did exactly that.  \nAmbiance: We were seated on the porch which was such a warm experience.  Although it was past 7 p.m. and quite chilly, they had over-head heat lamps which were at perfect setting.  We had beautiful plants and garden accessories around us, while we sat on rocking chairs, listening to the blues. \nDrinks:   We started off with water.  It came in a nice glass 42 oz bottle.   I ordered an alcoholic beverage, but for the life of me, I cannot remember the name, other than it had rum, orange juice, and other splashes.   It was delicious and I had enough with just one. \nFood:  We ordered fried chicken, ham hock collards, garlic mashed potatoes/gravy, and the mac and cheese.   The chicken is to die for.  It is nice and crispy on the outside and amazingly moist on the inside.  The batter is on the thick side but not overwhelming with amazing spices.  By far, the best fried chicken I have had.   My fianc\u00e9 ordered the ham hock collards.  Sadly, I didn't get to taste them because he ate them all before I could try them!  Therefore, I assume they were good.  The garlic mash and gravy were delicious.  They were nice and creamy with the perfect amount of garlic.  The gravy was a great compliment and not too thin or thick.    My favorite side was the mac and cheese.......Oh my, it was bomb!  It was brought out in the baking skillet and was perfectly baked, thick, and cheesy (I hate water-downed mac and cheese).\nDessert:  We ordered the beignets.  Although everything was amazing, the beignets were the least of my favorite.  They were not bad, but I like my beignets soft and with syrup.  These beignets were very powdery and crunchy. \nOverall, we had an awesome experience.   The portions to the mains are quite big and sharable if you order extra sides.  We will definitely return; next time for brunch!", "author": "Ms. Z."}

It was cold, mushy and gross. \n\nI showed the server, and she took it back and then returned to the table to tell me that \"this is the way it's supposed to be served\"... as if it's ahi or something.

It is about the sour of the cheese against saltiness of the bacon with sweet date.  If the cheese isn't just filler.  Also the cheese was cold  it should be warm & gooey.  \n\nThe chicken was a C at best I have had better in SF. If you factor for the price it isn't even close to the best.  The meat was moist but no real flavor same with the crust. I like my crust to have a little flavor this was bland.\n\nSides mash potatoes were flavorless and stiff.   Greens were ok chunks of bacon or pork belly always help.  \n\nIn the WTF / Why bother category.  They put popcorn on the side of the plate. I'm guessing as a garish. Why they do this I will never know total waste of popcorn & time. At the top of the meal they give you ONE MINI corn muffin it actually looked like they gave me more butter in the little metal container then muffin to spread it on.

Well, it doesn't compare to Louisiana/New Orleans, I will tell you that, but comeon now, we're in California.  I wasn't expecting to be transported to New Orleans.  \n\nThe people there were nice and funny, the atmosphere and decor were casual/cool/chill.  There was a live jazz band that took up a lot of the walking space, but it was cool to see some little kids dancing by them.\n\nSo my friend and I decided to share a bunch of things.  they have 5 inch poboys, so we decided to get 3: oyster. pulled pork, and catfish.  I was disappointed when they told me the 5 inch could not be cut in half because it was too small and would fall apart.  I know it would have looked messier than they would have liked, but we had a hell of a time with that butter knife and it was a pain in the butt.  So taste wise, the oyster was the best and was fried really well.  The catfish came in second, fried well, but a little dry.  The pork one  i wasn't really feeling.  I just ate it coz we got it.\n\nWe also got fried okra (same batter as the oysters and catfish), red beans and rice (sadly I like popeyes more), and the beignets (very disappointing because they were heavy and not light and fluffy like  i was expecting).\n\nOverall, I am glad I tried it.  If  I were in the area again, I might consider it, but for the price (and it was a bit pricey), I think I would try something else.", "author": "vanessa t."}

It's a southern-fried cajun themed place that serves primarily meat, fried chicken and pork dishes, though there are some deep-friend veggie options if you'd prefer. \n\nI opted for the pulled pork sandwich, which was tasty, although I expected a little softer bread. (Any southern cooking I've ever had has a lot of love for their buns.)\n\nPoints to them for some seriously good thick fries, too many places opt solely for the thinner ones, and Front Porch seasoned theirs just right.\n\nI left feeling satisfied, but not totally blown away.

There's a terrace above the main door along with their menu and a couple tables as well. There's even a baby rocking horse! Cute!\n\nAnyways, my boyfriend and I came here for his 28th birthday (7/16/12) to celebrate and have a feast! We were greeted with the seating hostess and she directed us to our table. My first impression as we walked inside the restaurant was that it was very dim-lighted... I mean, very dim-lighted. The bar lighted up the restaurant but not completely. And this place is quite small... The maximum capacity could only probably fit 40-50 people. But I guess that's what makes the restaurant unique and intimate! \n\nWe were seated in a booth and we could see the chefs cook in the kitchen! Our waitress was really nice. Our waitress didn't rush us with our order and made sure that we were taken care of. \n\nI ordered a Donkey D's Hot Ass Margarita which was smooth and pretty good! It had slices of Jalepeno's and jalepeno juice as well. My bf ordered a \"Chilled\" Mulled wine which was good too. For our appetizer, we shared the fried pickles with a creamy, spicy aioli sauce! OMG those fried pickles were amazing, My mouth is watering just thinking about them! So crunchy, so juicy. So full of flavor. Our waitress told us that the chef de cuisine pickles their own cucumbers at the restaurant! And the pickles are deep-fried in a beer batter. YUM! \n\nFor our entree, my bf and I both ordered 3 pieces of fried chicken which came with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens. The chicken was juicy and tender, and the crunchy skin was crunchy, but not greasy. My bf and I thought that there could have been more season though... The garlic mashed potatoes were good, but not great. I did enjoy the collard greens. In fact, that was my first time having collard greens! My bf ordered a side of baked Mac & Cheese and it was good too! It came in a little skillet that was piping hot! Oh yeah, all of our food was piping hot! Great indicator!!!! The Mac & Cheese was flavorful and had a nice creaminess too. I ordered a side of fried corn on the cob with chili lime butter. The corn was tasty and had a little crunch too! The chili lime butter wasn't overwhelming.\n\nEverything was great! Our service was great! The only thing though that was a little iffy was the lighting in the restaurant. I had to use the light on my phone to read the menu... But other than that, I would definitely come back here and experience more of the menu items! This food is definitely \"Stick-to-your-ribs\" kind of food. :)", "author": "Francesca H."}

Very claustrophobic feeling. The food is OK, the service is OK. I didn't find that the chicken, although good, was anything special. I expected a lot more for what they were charging.

It was a little tricky to spot because the building looked like a house but we figured it out quickly enough. \n\nOut front it definitely feels like a front porch, which is quaint, and when we walked inside, it was super dark and felt more like a bar that serves food rather than a restaurant with a bar. Overall though I really liked the aesthetic and once my eyes adjusted to the low light I grew to like the ambiance.\n\nMy girlfriend and I both ordered the chicken and sweet potato waffles, which seems to be our test of a brunch spot that has that on the menu.  The waffle was pretty spot on and the chicken was really moist but the breading was a little lackluster.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "We really wanted to like this place after seeing Guy Fieri's glowing review of the Front Porch on DDD. What we encountered was a series of \"misses\" that added up to a disappointing and mediocre experience. \n\nFirst of all, we had a 9PM reservation on a Saturday night. We waited about half an hour for our table. I recognize that a restaurant can't predict how long a group will keep a table, so I cut them some slack on this one. The host was very polite and kept us apprised of the status of our table. \n\nNext, the space itself resembles a dark, windowless cave with sound bouncing off every wall. Hardly a Southern comfortable atmosphere. \n\nNext, the server took our drink orders. I asked for a mojito and was informed that the restaurant doesn't stock fresh mint. Really? A Southern comfort restaurant with a full liquor license doesn't have fresh mint for Mint Juleps & Mojitos? I found this particularly odd given that one of the menu items was a salad CONTAINING mint. Do they use dried mint? I don't blame the server. It just seems like a dickish policy on the part of the management. \n\nNext, the server brought cornbread. Only they were itsy bitsy mini cornbread muffins - more like cornbread bites than muffins. They were not only dried out but actually stale - as in not fresh. The sage butter wasn't of much help. \n\nWanting to avoid a lot of deep fried food, we ordered the $9 chopped salad with Green Goddess dressing & a side of biscuits, which we asked to be brought out with the salad. The salad was fresh and crisp but had almost no flavor and none of the savory goodness of good house made Green Goddess dressing. The biscuits weren't brought out until after we had finished the salad. I saw the server nudge the kitchen staff several times but it did no good. The biscuits themselves were quite decent & were served with sage butter & a tasty strawberry syrup. Probably the best food of the evening. \n\nTaking Guy Fieri's recommendation, we ordered two of the Front Porch's signature dishes: the Dr. Pepper braised beef short ribs & the spicy shrimp with grits. The 5 medium sized shrimp sitting in a puddle of grits & mildly spicy sauce were acceptable but nothing special. For $23.50 I expect better. The braised short ribs were dry, stringy, and flavorless. Even dipping the meat in the sauce didn't relieve the meat's dry stringiness. The short ribs were simply cooked to death. Or as my friend exclaimed, practically hurt, \"I can't believe they killed the meat\". Definitely overpriced at $24.\n\nNow I know that restaurants can have off nights. But botching both of the signature dishes? And on a Saturday night? Not a good sign. I guess that's why the servers were trying to steer everyone towards the fried chicken. I guess they knew something. \n\nI give the restaurant two stars because the service was efficient and attentive. But I won't return to the Front Porch. Brenda's on Polk sets a high bar for Southern comfort/Soul food in this city and this place just doesn't stack up.", "author": "moncho b."}

Sadly, it wasn't at TFP.  The meat was very moist, but it severely lacked flavor.  Maybe it was an off night?\n\nI've grown to like collard greens Southern-style, but I didn't like the way they served theirs.  It was overpowered by a very strong sour taste.\n\nI ordered the Farmer's Market, which I think changes every so often; it's usually seasonal vegetables in some form.  Last night, it was chopped root veggies and rice cooked in a tomato broth, then served with some cabbage slaw on top.  The best way I can describe this is a really dense vegetable-and-rice stew.. pureed.  It was good, but since it was the only thing on my plate, became too one-note for me.  I would've preferred a plate of veggies in that delicious broth, with a side of rice.\n\nThe only things I absolutely loved about TFP were the service, the ginger beer, and BF's mashed potatoes from his fried chicken.

We stopped in on a rainy Saturday morning, took a couple of seats at the bar and put down a pint of Anchor IPA while we perused the menu.  Everything sounded so good we ordered practically one of everything...\n\nBy far the best dish was the fried chicken and waffles. Juicy and brined fried chicken, the thigh was my favorite and the waffles were so soft and melt-in-your-mouth good.  We loved the dish so much we ordered a second order of waffles!\n\nThe  fried okra was excellent, it was lightly battered and fried crispy, the sauce it was served with added a nice creamy dimension to the dish.\n\nMy friend Dan ordered the shrimp and grits, which were excellent.  It was served in a dark, brown gravy like sauce, kind of like a grits meets etouffee recipe.\n\nThe muffaletta sandwich was good, but not quite what I'm accustomed to from New Orleans.  Although the ham and cured meats were great and their homemade giardiniera was awesome, the bread was too light and flaky to absorb the vinegar and oils from the pickled vegetables and melted cheese.  If they served it on a thicker bread, this sandwich would be amazing.\n \nThe only dish we didn't particularly care for was the red beans and rice, which I thought lacked flavor and contained a lot of red kidney beans, where I prefer pinto beans.  \n\nThe other great part about our meal was the southern band playing.  Band playing southern. Ghost pepper hot sauce was amazing...nice \n\nFinally, a good tip for the non-tasters/hot sauce fiends out there...they have a secret super hot sauce that they serve only upon request called the \"Ghost Pepper Sauce.\"  This sauce was potent, but the flavor and complexity in it are rare.

The sausage was less breakfast sausage and more kielbasa or something but it was very good. Grits are one of my favorite foods and these were winners. I just poured the whole bowl into my mouth (not really true). Fried chicken and waffles is a great meal. And I've had some great versions at many awesome restaurants.

We killed time at the bar, rapidly losing precious degrees of body temperature as the front door to the front porch didn't really close as people continually walked in and out. The cocktails were a little heavy on the herbs for me - I found the lillita too minty, but liked the lana lee sweet tea, although it was a little weak.\n\nI was pretty disappointed to find that the complimentary cornbread seems to be a thing of the past. We shared the fried chicken, catfish (fried), and the short ribs. The short ribs were the worst of the bunch - they were overly fatty and still tough rather than tender. We subbed in fries instead of mashed potatoes, and they were excellent - one of the highlights of the meal, although the aioli with them was spicier than I would have liked. \n\nThe catfish was a pretty good chunk of meat. I'm no hush puppy expert, but I found these to be tasty, although overly dense. The coleslaw was bland but inoffensive - similar to the sweet potato fries. I liked the chicken - a single order came with a small but meaty breast, wing, drum, and thigh. I thought the breast was well cooked, but the thigh was overdone. I quite enjoyed the vinegary greens with the rich mashed potatoes, although I wished the latter had had more texture.\n\nThe trio of sorbets from mitchell's were outstanding.

You're thinking, WTF!!!\n\nI was thinking the same thing but based on the reviews and b/c it's in San Francisco (one of the best cities for dining), I decided to give this place a go. Actually, my fiancee set this up for an early bday dinner so who am I to say no to a free meal?? lol\n\nWith this 9 piece bucket meal, it came with mashed potatoes and collard greens.The sides were pretty good. The greens had a lot of vinegar, which I don't mind too much b/c that's the style but some people may not like it that way. The mashed potatoes had good texture and was pretty good.\n\nBut it's all about the chicken. There are a few types of dishes that I hold a pretty high standard for b/c I have eaten a lot of it at various places throughout the country. This list includes steak, jambalaya and of course fried chicken.\n\nYou get 2 pieces per body part (2 breasts, 2 wings, 2 thighs, 2 legs). For the 9th piece, you just roll the dice to see what part they give (no place gives breasts). I used to work at Popeye's fyi =) \n\nHowever, upon tackling my last piece, I noticed an extra breast!!! They hooked it up with 3 breasts. I am a \"breast man\" ahem so I was happy.\n\nI did ask the waiter how many breasts came in the bucket and she said  \"usuallly two\". I worried a bit b/c I wanted to make sure I had at least 2 in there but the extra one made me burst out with tears of joy!! Okay that's exagerrating but you get the point.\n\nSince one from the bay area cannot go to New Orleans for the best fried chicken, this place doesn't take a back seat. It takes 25 minutes to make since they make it \"to order\", which is fine by me. All the more delicious.", "author": "James K."}

I got to experience a restaurant in a part of town I have never been.  Bernal Heights, I'll be seeing more of you.\n\nThe chicken, the chicken, the chicken.  It's all about the chicken!  It comes out piping hot and is super moist.  The batter is crunchy and so flavorful without weighing down the chicken.  The spices are abundant and so fragrant that when we brought home the remaining chicken, our car smelled so delicious after only a minute.  Even warmed up in the oven 2 days later the chicken was still fantastic and moist.\n\nThe problem with the chicken is that you can either order 3 pieces for $17 or 9 pieces for $34.  3 is not enough for 2 people but 9 is too much.  I wish there was an in between range.  I'm obviously going to go for the nine piece because my asian mathematical brain and lean wallet tells me so.  The chicken comes with a side of mashed potatoes and collard greens.  Both are wonderful with the collards having a hint of vinegar.  They also have 2 hot sauces, one being habanero that are both spicy and good.\n\nThe sides are also very good but my main complaint is that the serving size of the sweet potato fries, fried pickles, and fried okra are smaller than my fist.  It is served in cones on a little wooden platter and you really can't get much in there.  And they want to charge me $6??  Yeah, I don't think so.  I enjoyed the fried okra the most as it wasn't slimy at all but my stomach was still empty and so was my wallet.  For the same price you can get mac and cheese and brussels sprouts which is substantially more food than the fried finger foods.  The mac and cheese was creamy and full of cheese.  I really enjoyed it but wished that they  had used a sharper cheese.\n\nI'll definitely be back for the chicken!", "author": "Mylinh M."}

Maybe it's just personal preference but I don't care for sweet salads and Creamed spinach shouldn't be chewy. The French Fries are nothing special.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe fried Okra was everything it should be. The Burger is pricey but good (I still make a better burger than anyone). I had the Ox tail dish on my first visit. It was decent but I barely remember it so it couldn't have been that exciting.\n\nThe mouth wateringly good:\n\nThe shrimp and grits dish was so good it almost made me cry because my friend ordered it and all I got was a taste. I will definitely order this the next time I go in.\n\nThe things I don't like about Front Porch:\n\nIt's way too dark. This is a casual restaurant not a romantic one. people come here for a social meal, not to get close in a dark booth. The lights were so low that I had to turn on my phone flashlight to see my food and then they turned them down lower.\n\nOn my last visit the waitress was a little too surly for my taste. I think we won her over in the end but to be honest that just isn't good enough. Even though the atmosphere is extremely homey Front Porch is not a cheap restaurant.

Parking was a bit difficult because there are so many popular restaurants nearby. My first impression? The outside definitely looks like a front porch lol. It was really dark and cozy with all the candelit tables going on. They played really good music and the service was good. Our waiter made sure our waters were filled. Cute milk jug idea by the way!\n\nWe didn't make a reservation and it seemed pretty empty, so we asked the host if we needed to make a reservation beforehand. She advised us to make reservations on Friday nights since it does get a bit packed, and it would be an hour and a half wait and then proceeded to lead us to our table. I didn't know if I should've felt bad for her since we didn't get her sarcasm or felt bad for us since we didn't get her sarcasm. Lol anyways!\n\nThe menus are just plain paper which added a nice laid back feel to the restaurant. Our waiter told us the specials for that night. He brought out complimentary corn bread which resembled long pieces of madelines accompanied with their yummy buttercream spread. We ended up getting a bucket of chicken which came with mashed potatoes, collared greens and a side of macaroni and cheese. Like my boyfriend said, the bucket of chicken really comes in a bucket! A popcorn bucket, with pieces of popcorn in the bucket adding a nice touch. Of course I was the one who munched on the popcorn. They give you a good amount of mashed potatoes and collared greens for 2 people and the macaroni and cheese was enough to share for 2 people as well. The total came out to about $40 something. A majority of that was the $34 bucket of chicken, though!\n\nThe chicken was so tender and juicy. Sweet Baby Jesus! My boyfriend and I were comparing the chicken to several restaurants and The Front Porch's chicken is hands down, my favorite. Almost no bone, all meat, and the batter is tasty! The mashed potatoes were a bit watery for me. I like my mashed potatoes creamy and buttery but these were just eh. The collared greens were soaked in vinegar which I absolutely hated! The macaroni and cheese? Let's just say if I could have one last meal before I die, this would be it. The macaroni and cheese is the best! It's not too creamy, not too strong on the cheese flavor and just perfect! I sort of didn't want to share with my boyfriend after I took that first bite.\n\nLove this place!

Parking was a nightmare, but that's to be expected on a Saturday night in SF so just be prepared to arrive early if you have reservations.  We had 8:30 reservations and got there early at 8:15.  Although we were told it would be a 5-10 minute wait, we were seated by 9.  Thanks for the 30 minute wait for our reservations, Front Porch :P\n\nI didn't really have any expectations coming in just because my friends picked out the place.  The Front Porch serves southern/Creole food and had a cool, slightly hipster vibe.  It did have a front porch/outdoor seating area of course and a nondescript door.  It was super dark inside but lit with candles.  I liked the dark wooden bar that ran the length of the restaurant, the wooden chairs, leather booths -- just an overall, cool prohibition-y type vibe.  \n\nI thought the cocktails and drinks selection was also pretty interesting -- a lot of prohibition style/southern drinks were available.  We had the complimentary corn bread appetizers which came with a yummy flavored butter (was it sun dried tomato? i don't know!) and the fried pickles.  The fried pickles were what you'd expect and nothing to write home about.  The service was pretty good.  The server came by pretty often to refill our waters and check in on us.  It was annoying that after we ordered, they told us the chicken would be a 20-25 minute wait.  It was actually a 45 minute wait for our entrees to come out.  Why can't they just give a realistic time frame for the wait? Ugh.\n\nFor our entrees, we had the catfish + salty funnel cake, large fried chicken bucket, and shrimp + grits.  The chicken was pretty good. I liked the flavor of the batter they used and the chicken was pretty tender with only a few bones.  It was $34 for 9 pieces of chicken and a small side of garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens and $18-20 for the other two entrees each.  The chicken was pretty good, but not worth the price to me.  The mashed potatoes were mediocre.  Not very flavorful and a little runny.  I've had better at Safeway!  I've never had collard greens before but they were pretty gross.  They were really sour tasting, mushy and had an awful after taste.  Yuck.  The bf had the shrimp and grits, which were a pretty small serving.  The grits were pretty bland, but the sauce was good.  Savory and slightly sweet.  The shrimp was decent.\n\nGoing to a restaurant in SF, you expect a few things: overpriced menu, terrible parking and a long wait.  The Front Porch delivered on all those things.  Besides that, the ambiance was pretty cool but the food was mediocre.  Come for the ambiance, the Prohibition/southern vibe and bar if that's what you're into, but the Front Porch delivers pretty average soul food.

While virtually all Cajun places try to emulate the experience and feel of being in NOLA, this is the first one I can say truly nailed it.\n\nMost importantly, so did the food and the service.\n\nWe started with a few beers and the fried okra appetizer. They had a solid tap lineup which is always a plus; not huge, but some great selections including Abita (for good measure), a Speakeasy specialty brew on cask, and a local Bay Area brew. The fried okra was delicious and came with a jalapeno aioli that had just a very mild kick to it. We also got complimentary mini cornbread with rosemary butter which was amazing. Never thought to combine rosemary in butter but will definitely start doing it now. \n\nDeciding on an entree was difficult since it all looked pretty awesome. I went with the fried chicken, mashed potatoes, and ham hock collard greens while my girlfriend did the shrimp and grits. We shared between the two and it was difficult to decide which was best since they were both so damn good.\n\nThe fried chicken is possibly the best I've ever had; definitely the best in SF thus far (beating out Brenda's and The Street's). It managed to be moist and flavorful without having a lot of grease at all--just the right amount. The collard greens were salty and went great with the mashed potatoes.\n\nAs great as the fried chicken was, the shrimp and grits were the winner of the day. I've never had grits so flavorful. The andouille sausage added some spice and bite and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. I won't even attempt to guess what kind of cajun creole voodoo magic they used to make that sauce, but whatever it was, it was fantastic. \n\nI could go on and on but bottom line is that this place is a home run.", "author": "Steve B."}

I would suggest making a reservation because the wait can be 45-hour plus. Regardless, it is definitely worth the wait. While you're waiting, you can order a drink from the bar and drink it right outside. I ordered the \"lovely day\" and my boyfriend ordered the \"shand job\". It was a lovely day for a shand job! *cues comedy punchline rimshot* The decor here is definitely unforgettable and unique with the hanging utensils and eccentric wall art. Not to mention the \"fucket get a bucket\" stickers on the water bottles (love it). My favorite dish is the stoner stack because it's a more elaborate biscuits and gravy with bacon and fried chicken in between the biscuits, yum. I have had it both times during my recent visit and will continue to keep ordering it. My boyfriend ordered the chicken and waffle and I wanted to cry because it was so good! The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. The waffle was soft and fluffy and had bacon bits mixed in. YES YOU GET A BACON INFUSED WAFFLE. Best idea ever. I also had the hangover helper and it was okay. The fried okra was really tasty but beware. You might end up eating the whole thing and get full before your main dish comes out.

A table hadn't opened for our reservation yet and we were 5-10 minutes late anyway.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine with boudin balls, shrimp and grits, fried chicken, mac and cheese, biscuits, boubon pecan pie and beignets.  I'm getting full again just reading the list.\n\nThe boudin balls were out pretty quick and were better than anticipated.  This was important since the mac and biscuits are cooked to order, meaning a 15min wait on each.  \n\nThey use real milled grits.  No matter how much butter you throw at instant grits, they'll never be as good as milled grits.  Add in spicy shrimp, plus some bacon and mushrooms, and you have a delicious entree.  This and fried chicken are two southern staples that I can't ever get enough of.  And once again, the fried chicken was great.  I ate the heck out of it.  Mashed potatoes too, of course.\n\nSomehow, the kitchen ran out of mac and cheese.  Normally I'd be crushed but given the volume of quality food in front of us, it seemed to be no big deal.

I would call this a criminal offense against shrimp and grits, but the shrimp weren't very fresh at all once I scraped off the sauce, so really the entire dish was doomed from the start.\n\nThe fried chicken and garlic mashed potatoes were tasty, and if I'd come with a group to split a bucket would also have been good value.

We got the fried pickles which were amazing, so I was really looking forward to my shrimp and grits for dinner. When it came, it looked unlike any other shrimp and grits I've gotten (which isn't necessarily bad), but it also didn't taste very good. Waaay over seasoned shrimp with mushrooms, onions, bacon, etc. with a bowl full of brown sauce over grits. Can you say heartburn? Less is definitely more, and they put everything but the kitchen sink on those grits. Furthermore, my husband's fried chicken was bland and his collard greens had a vinegary flavor that missed the mark.  \n\nAnd could you guys turn on a light or two?

You'll need to make a reservation or wait awhile if you don't. I've been dining and drinking in SF for 20+ years and don't mind that some of our restaurants are going hipster, but what I DO mind is as we were finishing up, a manager (?) came to our table and told us \"someone is waiting for your table\". We were appalled and let him know. Our group of four had fried chicken, mac 'n' cheese, and pork chops, along with a few drinks, so they certainly got their money's worth out of us! I can count on one hand the number of times I've been \"rushed out\" of a restaurant and I never go back after that happens. There are PLENTY of delicious mid-range restaurants in the city, so who needs the drama? The sad thing is, the wait staff had been perfectly cordial up until this guy stepped in and ruins the experience. \n\nIf you're looking for a similar food experience that is actually better, go to Hard Knox Cafe. The fried chicken is awesome, the atmosphere is laid back, and the owners and staff are extremely sweet and accommodating.

Last night was one of those occasions, plus I wanted to impress my guy and take him out for his birthday to a place I knew he would enjoy, so off to the Front Porch we went.  I heard many good things about this place from coworkers and it has been on my to-try list for quite some time.\n\nWe really enjoyed our meal here, starting with the trendy, yet homey and warm atmospere.  We started with glasses of Pino and Zin and shrimp hushpuppies.  For dinner we ordered fried chicken with mashers and collard greens and spicy shrimp grits.  I had the grits.  They were very flavorful, with truffles providing just the right touch.  I managed to snag one piece of fried chicken, and it was everything that I would want in fried chicken, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  Judging by my date's reaction, he was in personal heaven.  Score!!!  We finished everything on our plates and had to have another glass of wine each to finish our meal.  I highly recommend Zinfandel for the red wine lovers, I could have sipped on it all night long.  Service was great.\n\nThe only downside were the hushpuppies, so I had to subtract one star.  They were fine, as far as hushpuppies go...but absolutely nothing to write home about.  In addition, when it says shrimp hushpuppies, I expected some shrimp.  It didn't seem like there were any shrimp inside, and if there was one, the shrimp was so small that it went unnoticed by the both of us, twice.  That was disappointing.  So, I will definitely bypass the appetizer next time and just focus on the main dishes.  Can't wait to try this place for brunch.", "author": "Marina S."}

I liked it, I thought the decor was cute, but I wasn't \"wowed.\" I never really go to Bernal.. Not my thing. Im always downtown (shopping addiction) or in Hayes (food addiction) or North Beach (Dessert addiction. And I love the wharf.) The staff were very friendly, and service was a-ok.. Not amazing, but nothing to complain about either. I noticed that most of the other patrons were hipsters.. Not my ideal crowd, but whatever, Im not there for them.. I came for the food. Which brings me to the next part of my review. \n\nI wanted to try their georgia peach drink, which they were unfortunately out of that day. Went for the \"front porch\" instead, i believe. It was small, but yummy and strong. I would get it again, and recommend it to others who dont mind the extra booze. But who does mind, eh?\n\nFried pickles- Holy moly yummy. I never had a fried pickle before, and boy was I missing out. I dont even like pickles, on anything, all the time.. I tried these out of curiosity and felt like i struck gold. Or green. Or both, since the batter was a beautiful golden brown. RECOMMEND.\n\nGrilled little gem salad with feta cheese, peaches, pecans, topped with a bacon shallot vinaigrette- this was probably one of the better salads ive had in a restaurant. I dont usually order salads actually, but the description sounded enticing. I must say it was quite delicious. Grilling the leaves added just a touch of smokiness, and all of the other components balanced nicely. Plus it had bacon. Nuff said. \n\nFried green tomatoes- I thought they were okay. My sister loved em. Personally I just dont like pimento cheese.\n\nGumbo- It was average. Ive had better, and Ive had worse. I wish it was a bit spicier or something though.. I felt it was a touch bland. \n\nFried corn on the cob- I never thought of frying corn on the cob, but something magical happens when you do. This isnt something I would want to eat a lot of, but its pretty good for sharing. It was less messy than I thought it would be. I dont know if the frying causes this, but it comes off of the cob a lot easier than expected, and nothing annoying stuck in my teeth.\n\nFried chicken- Sadly, I wasnt really a fan of the fried chicken. I thought it was overpriced and rather bland. I wasnt a huge fan of the collard greens either, which I usually love. Ill continue to make trips to Hard Knox for my chicken cravings. \n\nGrilled hanger steak- it was good. I had the steak done rare. I liked everything that came with it too. The creamed corn was good, the broccolini was nicely flavored, and you cant go wrong with onion rings.\n\nNo, I did not finish everything by myself. Yes, I would return to this restaurant. :)", "author": "Alison A."}

I enjoyed being in line as much as I enjoyed the food; it was such a pleasure.\n\nI prefer my oysters snotty raw and straight up, possibly with a light spray of lemon, so I wasn't prepared to like the pickled spring onions that accompanied ours. But they did not overwhelm and delicately balanced the oyster. I would definitely order them again. Note: do not eat the colorful items below the shells, those are salt granules.  \n\nThe spicy shrimp and grits were wonderful. Not that I have a lot of experience, but I have never had a better grit. I would go back soon to ensure I have that the shrimp again before they change their menu.\n\nThe chicken was a little peppery for me. Certainly enjoyable, but I think it was unnecessarily seasoned. Just as I wouldn't ever think to use a pepper shaker on my fried chicken, I don't think I wanted it baked in there. It wasn't bad, but just a bit distracting.  \n\nThe steak was perfectly prepared and the tomatoes and bordelaise were fantastic. I loved it.\n\nThe reason to dock the Porch a star is due to the desserts. Just don't bother with the strawberry shortcake or the donut bread pudding. In a nutshell, they were not very good.

I occasionally branch out, but always find myself missing the chicken. Also, (being from Texas) I have frequently lamented that nowhere in California could I find my favorite side dish: fried okra. Not only did I find it at the Front Porch, but it is hands down the best fried okra I've ever had. The spicy crab & grits are also a fave. And the corn shaped corn bread - whats not to love? \n\nThe wait is long on a weekend night, but if you can find a seat on the front porch it is a good time.

I probably should've just gone with the flow and ordered the chicken and waffles, but it seemed like a lot of food for brunch.\n\nI ordered the sweet potato and pork belly hash with eggs. Imagine my surprise when there was very little of anything in it. There was hardly any pork belly in the dish and what was there was under seasoned (salt and pepper for god's sake!). There were no onions or peppers or anything else, it was just sweet potatoes and a tiny amount of pork belly under two eggs. \n\nWhich don't come with toast? I guess I wouldn't have minded paying extra for toast if the bread hadn't been the crappiest white bread possible. Bad toast isn't something you notice until you're paying extra for it, and it's terrible. How can restaurants continue to use shitty bread in this town?

I was in talks with one of the owners, Kevin, who was an extremely friendly and gracious host, in the week leading up to our dinner and found that the restaurant was very accommodating. They drew up a great menu for our dinner and worked with me closely to make sure I was happy.\n\nThe night of, the prepared a cocktail reception with small appetizers. Their deep fried chicken sushi comes to mind... it was unforgettable! The staff were extremely friendly and went above and beyond. We had an open bar, and the bartender was very patient and did a good job tending to our group, even the drunk ones! The food came in 4 courses, the small appetizers, shared appetizers, entree and dessert. One of the favorites of the night was their bacon wrapped dates, you must try it. Their Dr. Pepper beef and fried chicken was also delicious. Most of the people from my family were from overseas and had never had Southern food before, but were raving about the food by the end of the night. \n\nAt the end, the staff got us taxis and helped us figure out where to go for those who wanted to stay out later. They were very friendly throughout the night and interacted with the group to make sure everyone was happy without being intrusive. The restaurant itself was cozy, and even though we were sitting on different tables, we were able to utilize the space to walk around and socialize throughout the night.

Moist, juicy, tender meat. And the kicker for it all was their house-made habanero hot sauce. A couple drops and you're good but anymore and you'll be grabbing for that milk.

So she flitted around the restaurant, dropping things and grumbling for a while, until she finally quoted us at 20 minutes. We decide to wait, but 20 minutes passed and no dice.

Southern hospitality, this ain't.\n\nThe final straw was when a girl who had reservations for two showed up with three extra people and they still got seated by pulling tables together that we could have sat at, easily.

Their \"pickle jar\" is totally rad for fans of pickled veggies, it often features everything from baby corn to jalapenos to eggplant all pickled with just enough spice and sweetness.  Their fried chicken is a total sensory indulgence, accompanied by savory, tangy collard greens and garlicky mashed potatoes.  Other highlights include the cast-iron-served mac-n-cheese, the fried okra and their complimentary corncakes which come with a delicately flavored butter.\n\nClassic comfort food meets modern ideas and service.  Cask-conditioned ales and other tasty libations, friendly environs and comfortable, cozy, though probably too noisy for some, atmosphere make for a nice night out.\n\nON A SIDE NOTE: let me mention that this is the only place in my 31 years on Earth where I've seen grown human beings consuming a bucket of fried chicken with a knife a fork.

First of all that is frickin' crazy! All you can eat KFC is crazy.\n\nWell, as gross as that sounds, I was now motivated to go find me some fried chicken. \n\nSo here I am...well, here I was (excuse the poor English).\n\nWent with the better half and her friend. Reservations were a breeze for a Friday night....shocking. But as usual, we had early reservations at 6:30.\n\nThis place has a crazy number of reviews, so I won't bore you with too many details, other than the following:\n\nSwamp Cabbage - Get it. it is delicious. For three people if you're hungry, get two.\nMac n cheese - you know it's good when you feel your mouth start salivating before the first spoon touches your lips. DON'T GET MORE THAN ONE. YOU WILL REGRET IT.....I DID.\nRice and Beans - surprisingly good and not healthy. This is not a healthy choice. It is healthier, but don't fool yourself.\nChicken bucket (ala KFC) - about 8 pieces served in a popcorn bucket with popcorn. Now I can eat a lot of chicken, but three pieces were more than enough. Lots of juicy flavor and better than Hard Knox (which used to be my favorite in the area).\nBeignets - Okay, don't bother. Eat more chicken\nCobbler - Get the Beignets before getting this, but again, see previous note.\n\nSo all that alone warrants the 5 stars, but what really pushed me to a solid 5 was the cask beer. For those of old English descent or enamored with the UK, cask beer is beer that is stored in cellar temperature - basically about 50 degrees.\n\nI was excited to see the beer on the menu and gave it a go. The first gulp was fantastic. Full flavored and lots of umph!, but the subsequent ones were just too warm. I had to switch for round two, but this was still a good beer. Definitely something to have once if you have never had cask beer before.\n\nThis place rocks. Rocks even more given the recent SFGate daily deal where $10 got you $20 of food. Yes!", "author": "Andrew C."}

Of course we ordered the frickels, which are also the best in SF, and the deviled eggs (yes, please!).

The vibe is casual and homey. It's in the mission so packed with the usual suspects: hipsters and urbanites. The menu is full of comfort food faves (so maybe there is hope for a 4 star review) and delectable cocktails. Seating is plentiful and that night there was a Mariachi band making their way through the restaurant. \n\nPrices and portions were definitely reasonable and service was prompt. \n\nI wanted to sample a little bit of everything so for starters we chose the Fried Green tomatoes and fried pickles. They also provide complimentary cornbread and these were addicting. Not the consistency of typical cornbread but definitely full of flavor and extra moist and buttery. \n\nThe fried green tomatoes were forgettable but the fried pickles were a surprising stand-out. They were breaded ever so lightly allowing you to taste the tartness of the pickle while still providing a nice crunch, and the dipping sauce rounded out it out perfectly. \n\nWe also ordered the biscuits which were a bit disappointing. I'd say Pillsbury has them beat. Southern cuisine is all about the staples and biscuits are as basic to Southern food as it gets. Theirs were more doughy than flaky and pretty bland. Although the pepper jelly helped the cause with its smooth sweet taste and slight kick. \n\nFor my entree I went with a classic: fried chicken mash and gravy and greens with bacon. The entire meal was a disappointment. I'm no chef but I can cook this same meal with more love and have it taste a whole heck of a lot better.\n\n My biggest gripe was their chicken. Overbreaded and way too crunchy (didn't even know this could be a bad thing). The batter was just an overly crunchy mess and while the chicken was juicy it just plain lacked flavor. The greens had way too much bite (sour) and were soggy. I hardly tasted the bacon at all. The mashed and gravy were the only saving grace. Potatoes were nice and light and the gravy was nice and thick. \n\nWe had filled up so didn't get to sample the dessert but I had tasted enough to make up my mind.  \n\nSouthern cuisine is at the top of my list and while Front Porch has plenty of charm their food lacks the flavor that's at the soul of Southern cooking.", "author": "Dorothy F."}

I have no firsthand knowledge of any relationship beyond some creepy similarities.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, Front Porch is like your badass little sister who got a bunch of tattoos and slept around in high school, but has matured into a pot smoking antique dealer with really fucking good food. Like delicious fried chicken, black eyed peas and greens, plantain chips with a tuna poke type thing, fried plantains (FRIED PLANTAINS ARE MY FAVORITE THING IN LIFE, AS YOU MAY KNOW), a thoughtful vegan entree, smoky soups and gratuitous avocado. Oh, and a bowl of grits that you stir in some chili oil and make a magical bowl of creamydeliciousness.\r\n\r\nCue the mellow sounds of Barry:\r\n\r\n\"IT'S LIKE THE MORE YOU GIVE, THE MORE I WANT IT... BABY, THAT'S NO LIE...\"\r\n\r\nI would probably have done a better job describing the menu if we weren't busying ourselves sucking down peachy sangria and pinot grigio out of juiceboxes, lunchbox style. Yes, really. My baby is all class.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I don't even remember dessert. But I do remember that they made an attempt at tin ceilings, which were frighteningly inauthentic, but a sweet gesture. Um, if you are actually interested in the merits of the interior from an architectural historian's perspective, I will say that the bathroom is where it's at. \r\n\r\nIn sum, great environment, nice owner, fantastic place to take a date or four bitches you're trying to ply with cheap wine and delicious foods.\r\n\r\nAnd so, Front Porch, I grab the (fake) mike and say to you:\r\n\r\n\"Baby, it may take all of my life...to find you... but you can believe it's going to take the rest of my life... to keep you... oh Oh OH DARLING I...

So finally to their fried chicken, so sorry to disappoint anyone but I sure definitely was disappointed. Gotta give the chicken a 2.5.

I have heard better things about the brunch service at TFP but I have YET to try.\n\nA friend of mine suggested we give this place a try since we were both craving some good ole southern comfort food. Be sure to keep your eyes pealed since this place can be quite hidden around night time and you can drive by this place and miss it. We had a reservation at 7:30pm and we were promptly seated. This ambiance of TFP  featured dim lighting and intimate setting with a nice hum/chatter/laughter of the patrons. The waitress came over and dropped about three different kinds of menus (a prefix, drink, and food). We took a quick look at the prefix which featured items we weren't too interested in so we passed on that. We then proceeded to browse the drink menu and decided on two cocktails (don't remember the name but one was mojito based and super tasty)\n\nOur drinks came promptly and the waitress came and took our order. We decided on their infamous Fried Chicken Bucket. We considered getting a side dish but opted out of getting one when our waitress told us that the side dishes (Collard Greens & Mashed Potatoes) that came with the bucket should be more than enough food for two people.\n\nThere was a wait time of around 25 minutes so stated in the menu for them to prepare the chicken. The chicken came out pipping hot in a large movie theater popcorn bucket with a handful of popcorn mixed with the chicken. We dug in the skin was crisp and the meat was tender and moist. DELICIOUS! The flavor was a little lacking since it was just white meat so a little hot sauce did the trick.\n\nThe mashed potatoes and collard greens were good but forgettable. Like the waitress said, we ended our meal with one remaining piece of fried chicken with 4 a piece. \n\nDuring our meal two different mariachi bands came into TFP and gave a performance for tips. It was pretty fun and entertaining the first time but by the second time it got a little annoying. \n\nParking can be a challenge but not impossible. \n\nOverall I had a great experience at TFP and would definitely come back again!", "author": "Myron J."}

It's sandwiched between 2 residential homes and you wouldn't be able to tell that it's a restaurant if you didn't know about it.\n\nWe walked in and it was so dark in there.

The way my bf & I work is we usually try to order different stuff, so this way we get to experience more of what the restaurant has to offer. But, this time, we couldn't decide. We both wanted the chicken and waffles. I was so determined to get it and he was too. Nothing else looked appetizing to us. So, we did. \n\nIt took probably 20-25 minutes for our food to come out and when it did...man, did it look super good.  I ate my chicken wings with the ghost hot sauce.

By the grace of the parking gods, we found a spot close to the restaurant relatively quickly. \n\nFOOD:\nFor appetizers, we split the fried okra and gumbo. The okra could have been seasoned a bit more. However, it was well-fried and not slimy like I expected. The gumbo was packed with flavor. I should also add the free corn bread was not too shabby, either!\n\nFor our main course, we shared the famous bucket o' chicken. The chicken came in a paper popcorn bucket with some popcorn. Our theory is that the popcorn keeps the chicken crispy and is not actually for consumption. The batter was tasty, and the chicken tender. \n\nI wasn't such a fan of the mashed potato and collard greens that came with the dish... the texture of the potatoes was a bit unusual (runny?) and the veggies too sour for my taste. However, we all enjoyed the mac-and-cheese and biscuits a lot. \n\nHubby also loved their homemade habanero sauce while I preferred their milder cayenne pepper hot sauce. You can also bring that stuff home with you for a small price!\n\nSERVICE: \nTo echo most other Yelpers, the service was friendly and attentive. Despite the crowd on a Friday night, our waitress kept our glasses full and answered all our questions about the menu. \n\nGOOD-TO-KNOW INFO:\n- Tab was reasonable (less than $25/person) for the amount of food we ordered. \n\n- Reservations are a safe bet for anything after 7pm on a Friday night. \n\n- The surrounding neighborhood is typical Mission/ Bernal Heights... be prepared to meet some colorful characters at night. \n\n- If you're like me and still crave sweets after a big, fat Southern meal, mosey over to Mitchell's Ice Cream down the street for dessert. :)", "author": "Wing Y."}

The deviled eggs were more out of curiosity... and they were cute and tasty but I don't know if I would order them again: they were good, not great. The fried okra was delicious and I would go back for it, but the jalape\u00f1o aioli was a miss -- as in missing not only heat but even on flavor... rather bland really.

The catfish was up there with some of the best I've ever had -- really great with their hot sauce -- and the onion rings were a cut above. The cole slaw was absolutely wonderful... nice and light, not too much or too little on the citrus/vinegary-flavored dressing and very very fresh.

And in my eyes, I think people gave this place too much praise. But my friend that I went with would probably say the opposite so this review will have both good & not so good in it.\n\n-Fried OKRA: very good. (It would be sad if a place messed up fried okra)\n-Fried CHICKEN, garlic mashers & gravy, collard greens: I didn't really like it.. I wasn't feeling the breading that they used.. I felt like they over did it and it was a bit overpowering. But my friend took a bite of my meal and he had the opposite reaction and really liked it. But at the least, I could say the mashed potatoes were really good\n-CATFISH, sweet potato fries, coleslaw and hushpuppies: The catfish was not bad at all.

It is dark and cozy with low ceilings that make you feel like you're on a date no matter who you're with. The food is excellent, and has a decent range for people who have dietary restrictions (vegans, gluten-free, low-carbers) and all of it is good. I've even had the vegan plate of grilled veggies which was incredibly flavorful -- and I am a hardcore meat-eater. The desserts are great, if you can stuff them down your gullet after eating the main course. I have never tried the fried chicken so I have no idea if it is good or not. The burgers are good, the salads are interesting and tasty, and the red beans and rice is flavorful, particularly with pork. Of course, what is not made better by pork fat? Nothing, that's what.\nOh yeah, drinks are good so sit at the bar if you can't get a table. And it gets crowded fast so make a reservation. The last time I was there it sounded as if they had my iTunes collection on shuffle, so if you also like My Bloody Valentine, the Pixies, early Adam and the Ants, and mid-90s brit pop, this should be your new go-to place for comfort food and a homey vibe.", "author": "Kely G."}

BUCKETS of it.  The only downside I see to fried chicken is that sometimes you encounter chicken skin that is so greasy, rubbery and tissue-like that it snaps off the chicken, lands on your chin and reminds you that you're eating the flesh of a disgusting fowl and have to stop before your feast has even begun (no offense to chicken lovers ... I just happen to think that birds are creepy when they are alive and poopy and glaring at your with their beady eyes). \n\nSomehow, the Front Porch manages to crisp the skin to such a light yet crunchy consistency that it crackles then melts into your mouth like that was its destiny. Each piece steams seductively from the bucket yet retains its moist succulence after you've snatched it up, torn it to bite-sized pieces and devoured it voraciously like the barbarian that you've always known you were.  \n\nWARNING: don't let the size of the bucket excite you too much.  It's a large popcorn bucket, but it's only half filled with eight to ten pieces of chicken (which is plenty for two to three hungry people or one hungry Jenny).  Guard your chicken from scavengers and eat each piece sparingly lest your daydreams of cold chicken for breakfast to be dashed!!\n\nApparently, there was other food on the menu at the Front Porch, but everything that I tasted was pretty forgettable and/or overpriced.  The spiced West Indian Chips were an interesting snack to munch on while waiting for the chicken, but everything else (beet salad, Plantain cakes and the side dishes (greens, potato salad, black eyed peas)) were tapas sized, cost too much for the quantity, and really didn't impress me as far as taste goes.\n\nThe restaurant is completely adorable.  From the open air front porch to the tin-lined ceiling, the dark wood bar to the eucalyptus scented bathrooms, this place was cute as a button.  It was just loaded to the gills with sweaty, hungry people and swampy as a Missourians armpits during an August heatwave.  \n\nOur group was lucky enough to get a next-day reservation and to be accommodated when we had last minute additions to the reservation, but it was a tight fit for eight of us in the booth area.  My left hamhock was hanging off the bench during the entire meal, and my body teetered on its ass crack until we finished eating and spilled out onto 29th Street.  \n\nMINOR GRIPE:\n*  They could stand to hire additional servers and bussers as it appears there were only two or three for the entire restaurant.  They were totally pleasant and hard-working (and I'm sure that they were doing the best that they could), but they deserve more help and the patrons deserve more water and corncob-shaped cornbread ;P", "author": "Jenny K."}

Last time I was here, I had an amazing grilled fish dish with chanterelle mushrooms.  Alas, it wasn't on the menu this time.  \n\nThe options for vegetarians are just as few and unsatisfying as in Alabama.  I loved the fried okra, crab fritters, and his mashed potatoes.  But, I have to say, my vegan plate was almost inedible.  All of the veggies were coated with some sort of oil that had a bad flavor and masked their natural taste.  I might have sent it back on another day, but I didn't want to cause trouble during the b'day boy's night out.\n\nI'm sure it's obvious, this being a southern/creole/soul food place, but I thought I would mention that this place is risky if you don't eat meat and can't stomach every single item you eat being fried or full of oil/butter.  \n\nI would up my stars to four or five if they added even just a couple of things to the menu that are slightly less fried / rich.", "author": "Grasshopper R."}

I came with 3 friends on a sunday night for dinner. \n\nFor starters, we had the fried okra and mussels. The fried okra was absolutely yummy! Loved it. The batter wasn't super thick and the flavor was just delicious. The mussels were good. Nice size and the broth had great flavor. \n\nEntree's.....well the two guys shared a bucket of chicken. We also had the shrimp & grits and the pork chop.\n\nFor some reason, not long after 6'ish, they dimmed the lights. The mood was already set when we walked in, but I guess it wasn't \"moody\" enough. I found the darkness to be a major problem in eating my nice thick pork chop. Ugh. It was so dark I couldn't tell the fat from the meat. I don't mind eating a bit of fat with my chop, but MAN...it was so gross to think I had cut a decent yummy chunk of chop and find out it's nothing but fat once I start chewing. It was the most frustrating chop I've ever eaten. Too bad because the chop was cooked well -- meaning not dry. \n\nThe sides that came with the chop were weird. One was a weird potato/apple cake thingy. And the greens....they only tasted like butter. \n\nMy friend said the shrimp and grits were worcestershire-y. \n\nThe hi-light of the meal was definitely the chicken. Not the best I've had, but it was pretty good. Nice and crispy and juicy. \n\nThe service was good. Waitress was helpful in offering suggestions for wine and beer.

The bacon didn't seem to add anything to the eggs but it did give it a bit of a chew so maybe that's a good thing?\n\nShrimp and Grits: The grits were very creamy, almost like a mash potato type of creamy. The shrimp were huge but I'm one of those people who really don't see the point in having the tails on shrimps and these came with them, it just made it a bit harder to eat; they were cooked perfectly though and they were big enough that I could overlook the tails =). The one issue I had with this dish was the sausage; they tasted way overcooked, they were hard and felt dry. The sausage added the heat to the dish which I could have done without but some may like it. All in all, I felt like this dish would have been perfect if it wasn't for the sausage.\n\nBurger: My friend's burger came with the standard accompaniments of veggies and it came with fries. I stole a couple of fries from my friend and they were done well, they were well seasoned so they didn't taste plain.\n\nOur waitress was attentive and the place had nice taste in music.

I made an opentable reservation, because Me and a companion were heading to Cobb's for a show and wanted to stop off to The Front Porch for a bite to eat. \n\n\nWe arrived early and talked to the hostess, who said we could start at the bar and be moved to our table. This was thoughtful, since even though the place wasn't that busy, we were told that the house was booked. Other guests arrived without reservations wanting to be seated. This is where our BAD experience at TFP began. \n\nThe Front of the House: \n\nOther non-reservation guests were seated in the back of the house, where there was more room and less cramped, while we sat at the bar and eventually were moved into small quarters. We confronted the hostess asking why we weren't seated before the guest without reservations. We were told that the guest said they were not going to stay long and would eat and leave (we beat them to the door). She was apologetic, that she had not offered us the same service first, but it still did not excuse the fact that others were seated before us. If I didn't have a groupon I would have just walked out.  \n\nI really wanted to like this place, but the start was not promising. We tried our best to get past it and ordered the Sweet potato fries with aioli , Three (3) piece fried chicken with mash potatoes and gravy, collard greens with bacon and baked mac and cheese. Ginger beer and sweet tea cooled our heated tempers but, the food was far from pleasing. \n\nThe Meal:\nComplimentary corn bread was much appreciated. The sweet potato fries and chicken were burnt and it tasted like the grease needed to be changed. The mac & cheese was just okay along with the potatoes & gravy. The collard greens missed the mark, where vinegar was soaked into them. \n\nOverall: \nThe hostess committed a major mistake in customer service. The food lacks that soul food taste advertised.

The servers have always been wonderful. There's also a chandelier constructed out of old silverware. \n\nThe food is rich as so much of the southern food is. The collared greens are cooked with the bits of ham (bacon?) and served in a mound of deep green leafy tenderness. The fried chicken is some of the best I've had in the city. I thought it was better than Hard Knox, Farmer Brown's, Little Skillet, and KFC. Nice and crispy skin outside, tender, flavorful and juicy inside. The shrimp with spicy grits was ok, as was the jambalaya. The red beans and rice with andouille sausage was a shade too smokey for my tastes. The crab flavor really shone through on the crab fritters.

If it was not for the fun company that night this would be a 2-star review.\n\nContext: group of seven for dinner on a Sunday night at 6:30\n\nAtmosphere: front porch, despite its name, might better be called basement. It's in this cave like, almost windowless space but it does have a few outside tables.  It also smells a bit like a basement, musty and airless. It's very small with maybe seven or eight tables and a long bar. It's also very dark. We had a table at the front that required some maneuvering to fit seven and moving around to let people in and put. It was right by the cash register and i was regularly bumped as staff passed including knocking my purse on the floor enough i decided to hold it. They were steady but not packed\n\nService: we were seated promptly upon arrival and they were fairly patient with our dithering and indecisiveness.  Wen we finally ordered, food and drinks came kind of willy nilly.  The server returned repeatedly to see if we needed anything.\n\nFood: I would call this kind of creoleish comfort food- fried chicken, gumbo. Mac and cheese, fried catfish, red beans and rice, etc. we ordered quite an array of choices. \n\nThe menu is medium sized but not very friendly for those looking for something light.  We started with fried pickles with an aioli and crawfish \u00e9touff\u00e9e French fries. The servings are medium sized but the two rich dishes were plenty for the seven of us. The pickles are like good fried food but they feel greasy, maybe because pickles are moisture filled? The \u00e9touff\u00e9e was just way too rich for my tastes with a pile of fries, smothered in a creole tomato sauce and tiny little shrimp. For mains, we had the fried chicken, the fried fish, some dish with shrimp, pork belly sandwich, red beans and rice with andouille, a salad, and gumbo. Fried chicken was moist and flavorful with a spicy taste to the chicken itself and not greasy. The fried fish was too mushy for my tastes. The shrimp dish was served on grits and was mildly tasty. The pork belly was like eating little chunks of flat fat on a big bun. I had one bite and couldn't eat anymore. It came with fries. The red beans and rice were tasty but not stand out. Salad was fine. Gumbo was a bit slimy with okra and not particularly flavorful, though not bad. Overall, I came away with the impression that the food did not have much flavor, which is weird given its creole-like foundation. They do give you two hot sauces, one of which is very hot, to heat things up which I generally poured on everything after trying it and finding it so blah. The chicken I think was the best dish.\n\nDrinks: beer, wine and cocktails are offered. Cocktails tend to be new orleanish including a sazerac.

Our company was located next to the mall, and I decided to get some lunch at the Chinese place at the food court. I went with the combo, which included Kung Pao chicken, Mongolian beef, steamed rice and mashed potatoes. Yep, mashed potatoes. Presenting, Chinese food, Utah-fied. \n\nI think Front Porch is the epitome of Southern cuisine, San Francisco-fied It's a little too apparent that they tried to make the restaurant into what San Franciscans think Southern restaurants look like. Instead, if they had tried to make it look and feel like a true Southern restaurant, it would have been more authentic and a bit less contrived. Also, hipster waiters, really? How is THAT Southern? \n\nI was a big fan of the patio with a couple of rocking chairs, but guess what? You're still in the Mission, watching people try to cram their Smart cars into \"motorcycles only\" spots. Although if you did sit in one of those chairs, you would have seen my car in its amazing parking spot right across the street. Yup, I got very lucky. The interior of the restaurant is dark but cute. The chandelier made out of old kitchen utensils was my favorite, the faux clay ceiling (read: plastic ceiling) was not. \n\nOur waiter appeared out of nowhere and told us a little bit about the menu. He also brought us two tiny pieces of cornbread; each piece was the size of a biscotti. The cornbread was good, I think, but who can tell when it's gone in two bites??? When I asked for iced tea, he, true to the Southern tradition, asked me whether I wanted \"sweet or un-sweet.\" While sweet tea is one of my favorite things in the world, I had to give it up a long time ago. It's just too much sugar. If you don't believe me, check this out: http://www.grits.com/tea.htm. Yep, 2 parts water, 1 part sugar. Shrug. \n\nWe ordered 3 appetizers to share: hush puppies, fried okra and yard clippins (a salad). The hush puppies were amazing, some of the best I've had this side of Mississippi. The fried okra was quite good, although anything deep fried is tasty. I think I liked it because I couldn't taste the okra, which I detest. The salad was organic and crispy, but the dressing that tasted like prune juice was absolutely horrible. I guess I am too old to drink sweet tea, but not old enough to drink prune juice. Hmmm. \n\nFor my entree, I went with the pork chop with andouille sausage cornbread stuffing. I liked the stuffing a lot more than the pork chop itself. The meat was overcooked and extra stringy. And no, it wasn't country-fried, so don't tell me \"that's how it was supposed to taste.\" My friend opted for the vegan plate, which was actually very good. I would have totally ordered it . . . as a side to my steak. \n\nAs we were driving back, I kept think about those hush puppies, the delicious deep fried cornballs. YUM. It would totally be worth it to get scalded by the Bluth Company Cornballer every once in a while, if I could only make those hush puppies at home.

Don't get me wrong, it is worth repeated visits but I am really wavering between the star ratings.\n\nFirst of all, the atomsphere was great. Clearly a hipster hangout place, I always felt like the un-hippest people there. \n\nIt was loud and fun, not good for talking with your brunch buddies but there was live band once! The decor was very interesting, a hodge-podge of random things, looking like a hoarding grandmother's living room. The small plates were not the standard-issued white, but all mismatched china with floral paints, as if they were hand-me downs and along the way, every family broke a few from each collection. Downside was that it was a little too dimly lit in the back. Service was good.\n\nAs for food, the po boys were good and the price was decent. I didn't really like the fried okras, on the greasier side, even for fried food. The shrimp and grit had a very nice sauce, slowly cooked so all the flavours mellowed together, nothing overpowering but complexed with depth. The portion was small tho and the grit was quite thin that I was hungry soon after.", "author": "Cindy B."}

The hubby wanted Hard Knox but I've been wanting to try Front Porch for quite a while, so many friends have told me this is THE place for fried chicken, plus FP has hush puppies so I convinced hubby we should try it out. \n\nThe place is small and decorated with that rockabilly country vibe but a bit too dark really, we both had a hard time reading the menu not that we need to review anything but the drinks since we were there for the fried chicken. We ordered the jalapeno hush puppies to start and of course two three piece fried chicken plates that come with garlics mashed potatoes and collard greens. I prefer having something crisp and fresh but you don't get a choice of what comes with it. The Hubby detests garlic and they did let him substitute french fries for the garlic mash but for a $2 fee which was odd to me I mean he was swapping potatoes for potatoes. \n\nThe jalapeno hush puppies were light and fluffy but a bit bland. I saw one tiny piece of jalapeno in mine and could not taste or feel any spice. The dipping sauce that came with it was OK, some sort of mayonnaise based sauce, personally I think a jalapeno jelly would have complimented better. \n\nWe were also given a side of corn bread which was probably one of the best things on the table. It was very fluffy and moist with the sweetness of the corn coming though in every bite. \n\nAfter the corn bread out came the fried chicken. It was beautifully fried but the pieces were cut so they were not whole pieces of fried chicken and they were overly seasoned. Poor hubby said it was garlic seasoned and had to pull off the batter and just eat the chicken which defeats the purpose of going for fried chicken. I didn't taste garlic ,more like some sort of off the shelf seasoning salt (Lawry's perhaps??) and WAY too much of it. It was like eating a fried salt lick, which was really too bad because the texture of the chicken was perfect, if only I could have tasted it instead of the salt. \n\nTo cut the salt I tried to rotate chicken with bites of mashed potatoes and collard greens but the potatoes were also overly salted and the greens too vinegary. I had to cut the salt with 2 glasses of cava which the waitresses kept trying to take away before I'd finished, probably because it is so f*cking dark in there!! \n\nI really don't see how this place has so many great reviews. Maybe some people like over priced tiny pieces of salty chicken, have only eaten KFC or don't know what greens or hush puppies are supposed to taste like. More power to them, they can stay here, I'll be going to Hard Knox.", "author": "Pilar B."}

I guess I will keep looking. It started off right, the decor, with the patterned ceilings and casual  chic decor. They even had Sazeracs and Abita beer on the bar menu. I had a glass of white wine because Sazeracs are too strong for me and I wasn't in a beer mood (need piles of boiled crawfish and  crabs to go with that ). I glanced at the dinner menu and became instantly suspicious. Too many California-ized dishes with so-called 'health conscious' ingredients mixed in with standard fried and sauteed in butter fare. It just seemed that the cook may have studied Southern cooking, but didn't really understand it. I ordered the flounder, as it is one of my favorite fish. It was too salty! I had really wanted to shrimp grits, but it wasn't on the menu that day. The jambalaya had peas in it--peas??? That would be paella maybe, but not jambalaya. The hush puppies were pretty good, with a nice kick and fried just right. Other customers were snarfing down the fried chicken, maybe that was the thing to order. Tried the beignets, but was disappointed. They were too cakey and they shook them in powdered sugar, rather than dumping a pile of it atop freshly fried dough (which New Orleans style beignets basically are--similar to Indian fry bread, but the shape and toppings are different). When you eat beignets, you are supposed to get a face full of powdered sugar!\n\nBut if you want a place with a cozy atmosphere and are not focusing much on the food, this is a nice place. Very lively with a homey feel. I happened to be there when a large group of blonde Southern women were busy celebrating a friend's birthday.

I've been here a few times, and each time, the experience has been memorable, service pleasant, and food delicious.  There's not much use in describing my dishes, as the menu changes seasonally, and vegan/fish dishes change daily or weekly.  \n\n----- The Location -----\nIn the heart of the Mission district, parking can be tough, and the area can seem seedy.  The restaurant is designed to be somewhat divey on the outside, the inside is quite nice.\n\n----- The Food -----\nI'm by no means a vegan (eating a sausage at the airport, waiting for a delayed flight), but any chance I can dine on some well done vegetarian/vegan food, I'm always down!  The first trip, I had the plantain risotto with mushrooms.  How can you go wrong?  The second time, I tried the fried chicken.  Though the chicken was good, it was just... fried chicken.  I'd prefer the Korean fried chicken style (less breading, more natural skin flavors), but good nonetheless.  The best part was the sides.  Brussel sprouts, grits, and fried okra.  I could see how some people might think the grits were too plain, but it was just as I like 'em.\n\nA note on the hot sauce.  They have an amazing habanero hot sauce.  It's like a habanera puree, so be careful!  I was putting this on everything.  Probably went through 3 tablespoons of it.\n\n----- The Booze -----\nMy coworker ordered a white wine from Chablis.  Very clean, very good!  Not overly dry, and paired perfectly with the food (except the brussel sprouts, which had a caramelized, sweet flavor).  I don't know much about white wines, but this one was very drinkable.  As my coworker says, this is what water should taste like!  Not that the wine is watered down, but drinking water should be replaced with drinking a Chablis.  Ooook, alkey (though I agree).\n\n----- The Dessert -----\nOk, so we had bread pudding and some other desserts, but we drank our dessert.  2006 Sauterne dessert wine.  It came in a miniature bell glass to allow proper aeration and maximum aromas (or, it just looked cute).\n\nWhy the four stars instead of five?  The second time I tried to getting the vegan dish, it had coconut.  Not only do I not like coconut, I'm somewhat allergic.  Not that this is their fault, but the fact that beyond the fun of the random vegan dish, there isn't really a lot of other options that pique my interest.  For that, 4 stars.", "author": "Steve A."}

Def not freshly made.\nFried okra...we enjoyed\nJambalaya...was decent but not worth 20 plus dollars\nFried chicken...best thing they have going for them.\nDessert...pumpkin br\u00fbl\u00e9e ....should have skipped it\n\nThe food is not worth the price you pay.  Sorry guys....I was really rooting for you.", "author": "Jenny G."}

Perfectly crispy on the outside but super moist and tender inside.  One of the best in the city (along with 1300 on Fillmore and Little Skillet).  \n\nLast night, I returned for a group dinner and in addition to the requisite chicken, we stuffed ourselves silly with so much more.\n\nHaving to wait about 45 minutes after our reservation, they gave us some fried okra and pickled veggies on the house.  The okra was nicely battered and fried and accompanied with a chili aioli.  One of my favorite dishes of the night.  The pickled veggies are also quite nice.\n\nFor appetizers, we had the beet salad (really good, especially accompanied by with the sweet pluots and peppery arugula), the fried green tomatoes (very fresh-tasting) and the blue crab and corn fritters (ok; too fried; lost a little flavor)\n\nFor my main, had the entree size of the spicy shrimp and grits, which were amazing!  The grits provided a nice creamy base for the shrimp, bacon and mushroom.  By far the best dish of the night.  Had a bite of the new york steak, which was pretty fatty and not too impressive.  \n\nOverall, great neighborhood place.  Be prepared to wait (even with reservations).

It's about 25-30% higher than it should be in terms of what you are getting - $21 for shrimp and grits which is great but expensive. Also the Pork chop is great but really, we only go there a couple times a year due to the price of a dinner for the two of us was $90 plus tip and we didnt' have that much food or drink. The Donkey D Hot Ass Margarita is spicy and yummy. But the weird thing was, on a Saturday evening they played heavy metal music the whole time which is not relaxing, not Southern, not conducive to conversation or feeling good. \nI figured the boss was away and it's also a way to get people in and OUT the door asap. Go there, everything is super good. A bit expensive and not super relaxing but still 4 stars. It needs $$$ rather than $$.", "author": "Kit M."}

If you are offered the hot sauce with the fried chicken, go ahead and accept but be very careful!  It's made with scotch bonnet peppers, which means you will sweat profusely and your mouth will be numb.

Decided to make a group thing out of it and had 2 other couples come with us in August 2012. We were highly anticipating it because the menu looked really good and we love Cajun/Creole food. I also previously worked at a Creole restaurant for a year as a cook and fell in love with the cuisine.\n\nWe arrived and the place was tiny, which is ok but we had 2 babies with us so it was a little awkward on placing the strollers and our seats without being in the way. Also one of the couples was a bit late, and so when they did show up the server seemed to be rushing us a bit to order. We ordered the Oysters Rockefeller, Hushpuppies and Fried Pickles. The Hushpuppies were good but I did not taste the supposed pork that was in it. They make their own BBQ sauce so that was cool but I didn't really care for it. The sauce that came with the pickles was awesome and who doesn't like Fried Pickles? :) I didn't have the Oysters because I don't like them, I think everyone enjoyed them but it was not something memorable. \n\nI also ordered a bowl of the Gumbo and I really did not like it, it was bland...just lacking flavor. 3 of us shared a bucket of Fried Chicken, which was fantastic, really moist and good flavor. The potatoes were good too but the collard greens were not so good, it seemed like they weren't seasoned or whatever they were seasoned with did not compliment it's flavor. One ordered the Shrimp and Grits dish and said it was really good and the other 2 ordered the Holy Shit Burger which they thought was AWESOME! \n\nMe and one other person finished with Bread pudding, that was good but again not really memorable. \n\nWhat we do remember however, is that one ordered coffee and the cream they brought with the coffee was lumpy and curdled...It is pretty normal for restaurants to pre pour cream into whatever they serve it to the table the day of service so that it is ready to go and saves time, but because this one was bad and there was a ring around the inside of the container, it told us that this cream had been sitting in the container for QUITE SOME TIME and no one was checking them to make sure if they were still good before serving to customers. That pretty much ruined the experience right there.

Ordered the fried chicken as it seemed best to start with their specialty. Asked the waitress (cute!) if we needed sides. She said no but that the chicken takes 25 mins so we ordered the butter lettuce salad with deep fried bacon. Sounded great.\n\nThe salad arrives and it's yummy. We're thinking this starting well. but then...the chicken arrived. It looked delicious but sadly it was about the blandest chicken I've ever had. It tasted like they had just taken plain chicken, rolled in flour and deep fried it. Nothing else what so ever. Even salt would have made it better but I would have expected something more too it.\n\nWe finished, left and only then confirmed with each other that we had both had the same bland chicken. Did we miss something? Was it an off night? I probably won't go back but maybe when I just can't think of anything else I'll give it another try. This time I won't order the chicken though.", "author": "Gregg T."}

Kinda cramped, but enough space. The decor was interesting, kinda dark, but not too bad. A lot of window shutters on the wall. Knick knacks and trinkets as well. We sat under a silverwear chandelier. If they were trying to capture that \"down south\" look, I think they pulled it off. Overall it felt clean which was good. The bar is along the left side of the dining room, and kitchen along the left side of the back dining room area. Didn't get too noisey at all.\n\nThe food. We ordered the mac and cheese of course based off the raving on here, which I must say... was very much worth it! So good and creamy. Piping hot out of the oven. The melted cheese on top was perfect and light, but had the stringy quality that we all loved as kids. Perfect flavor and the consistancy of the mac was perfect. Not too hard, not soppy soft. Add a dash of their home made hot sauce to spice it up. So good. I ordered the pork chop, and damn! It was way bigger than I thought it would be! I was nervous about it maybe being too dry, but it was just right. Not chalky dry at all. Really juicy, loads of flavor, and the potatoes it came with and greens, made it PERFECT. I don't eat pork chops a lot at all, but this re-ignited my tastebuds from being in pork chop hibernation all this time. Again, I used the home made hot sauces and it just enhanced the already flavor it had. Trust me, by the time i was finished with it, I was STUFFED! My girlfriend ordered the three piece fried chicken entree. I forgot what it came with but that too was really good. Personally I don't like to eat too many things fried, but the chicken wasn't greasy at all. Almost like a broaster style but with way more flavor. The chicken was a liiiitle dry, but it wasn't bad at all. The spices made up for that so much. Very good and tastey.\n\nPrice was kind of steep for the things we ordered. I think it came out to be around $60 for the three things we ordered, but to me it was worth it. How often do we eat southern food really? \n\nWould we come back? Maybe. After some debate, my GF would come back for the Mac and Cheese alone, I would also, but I wouldn't mind trying something else on the menu as well.", "author": "Jay V."}

Glad I have now.\n\nThe ambiance? I'd describe it as the sort of place the modern, stylish, yet slightly rag-tag cast of \"Rent\" would hang out: Funky, dark, eclectic, and resolutely welcoming to one and all. Our waitress didn't put on airs. \n\nNeither did the menu. It doesn't feature soul food of the southern \"grits 'n hush puppies\" variety, but rather, funky, Caribbean-accented comfort food to nourish the soul. \n\nMy two friends and I were prompted to order the oft-praised cod fritters as an appetizer. As promised, one order wasn't enough for three people, so we'd gotten two. They were good, although not as orgasmic as some reviewers would lead you to believe; the accompanying sauce was deemed too salty by my tablemates. \n\nFor an entree, I ordered the again-oft-praised Miss Ollie's fried chicken plate, which came with black eyed peas with ham hocks, and mac n' cheese. Not a disappointment, exactly, since it all tasted good enough; But not transcendent, either. The chicken wasn't particularly hot when it arrived, the batter was a little too crispy for my liking, and the meat was a little on the dry side. The mac n' cheese was also kind of cold and a little rubbery. Still, it all tasted good, and the sheer warm-and-fuzzy nature of what I was eating made up for a lack of refinement. \n\nMy two friends both ordered the same main course, which may have been the crab n' grits. They liked it well enough. \n\nBecause restaurants with this much soul are a rarity, even in food-packed San Francisco, I do recommend Front Porch for a casual meal with friends.", "author": "Suzie Q."}

Out of the 4 of us, 2 of us really enjoyed our dishes while the other 2 did not. The chicken and waffles (a friend ordered this) looked and I was told were amazing! The stoner stack which my gf had was also right in the money, bacon cheddar friend chicken on a biscuit. I ordered the sweet potato and pulled pork hash which unfortunately was more of a bell pepper and onion salad with about 3 pieces of pork. Unfortunately I was pretty disappointed with this particular selection as I was expecting a decent amount of pork and for it to be chopped up a bit more like a real hash. My other friend ordered the grits and they just went a bit too hard on the butter. Not sure if it was the brunch rush, but we put in some side orders and they forgot to put them in 2x along with one of my friends pieces of chicken being dropped.

If you do arrive early, the bar across the street has a very decent selection. Cash Only. \n\nDinner:\n\nBacon wrapped fried dates- The reduction was too sweet for my taste and the amount of cheese ended up overpowering the entire dish. In a bacon dish, it would be nice to taste more bacon, since it's awesome.\n\nPulled pork sliders- These three little sandwiches were the perfect size. It's pretty hard to mess up pulled pork. These are decent.\n\nSingle order of Fried Chicken- The presentation for this was very cute. The mash potatoes are definitely the highlight of the plate. The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside, but lacked a lot of flavor. It was just... fried chicken. \n\nFried okra with jalapeno aioli- This came out super well done! I love crunchy things but as soon as I would take my first bite, the batter would crumble and fall apart on my plate. At the end of the day, you can't mess up fried okra that badly so this was decent as well.\n\nRoasted brussel sprouts with apples and bacon- They cut the brussel sprouts in half for this dish. I personally can't fit the half into my mouth so I have to cut them up more. This dish tastes exactly as you would expect, so not much to say. We definitely ordered it for the health factor. :)\n\nBaked mac & cheese-  I really believe KFCs mac and cheese tastes better. I thought maybe they would have a good blend of cheeses, but it's just plain ol' mac and cheese. Nothing special and I wish I didn't waste money on it.\n\nConclusion: They included an 18% gratuity on our bill, with a party of 2 people! You're better off spending your time and money at Farmer Browns or Hard Knox where you will find good tasting quality food. If you're looking for a night out at a trendy spot in a gentrified neighborhood, then this place is for you!", "author": "Lilimae S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-09-16", "description": "I wanted it to be good. The staff was great and, as my dinner companion observed, the decor was \"cute\"--she said while sitting on a car bench seat. It was not to be. I've seen reviews that commented on changes in management/kitchen staff; maybe that explains it.\n\nThe spicy shrimp & grits was fine. No complexity at all to the sauce, which is to be expected if it's really spicy, but this wasn't. In this case, the grits basically served as a sauce delivery mechanism, which is a bit unfortunate: buttered grits are essential soul food, but I only got any flavor of that when I found an edge of the dish that the sauce had sloshed away from. The mushrooms and shrimp were cooked satisfactorily. Satisfactory... good word for this place. Also an apt description of the complimentary cornbread.\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the chicken fried steak (with corn and mashed potatoes/gravy) and the fried chicken (with green beans and mashed potatoes/gravy). To their credit, the presentations of the two dishes were reasonably distinctive and appropriate, even though the mash+protein+vegetable format was the same.\n\nWhile I'm giving credit, the fried chicken was decent. As my companion put it, it was \"suspiciously juicy\"--surely brined, but I'm not prepared to call obvious brining a bad thing. There were some crust adhesion issues but the flavor was good, although I was turned off when I encountered some undercooking in a particularly thick piece.\n\nThe mashed potatoes and the gravy were fine. If half-stars were available, they'd get one for the complimentary bites that were brought to the table: blue cheese and, I believe, walnut, on crostini with microgreens. Downside: it was just a bite. We had some thoughts on that, too, but since it was tasty and reasonably well-done, I'll leave the nitpicks aside.\n\nThe chicken fried steak, on the other hand, was a mess. First of all: no reasonable interpretation of the dish can involve a too-thick, too-tough cut of meat. The whole point of the thing is to pound the crap out of such a tough cut and then cook it until fork-tender. I needed my steak knife.\n\nBut even if you imagine that to be a quirk of interpretation, the breading situation was so bad that I couldn't help but joke that they'd come up with a deconstructed chicken fried steak, with the breading served on the side. It might have even been plausible had the whole thing not been hidden underneath a mess of average gravy. I honestly thought there was twice as much steak as there ended up being, just because of the amount of breading spread over the plate like shrapnel. There was one place where it wasn't to be found, though: on the meat.\n\nSo, I've got to give it a star for ambiance and a star for service, but I can get equal or better food at too many places to give real credit on that front. Maybe it was an off night; I'm not planning to increase my sample size, though.", "author": "Mike M."}

We indulged ourselves with lots of fried goodies...hush puppies, fried okra (cut in half) and fried pickles.  The fried chicken was nice and crispy on the outside but the meat was still moist and juicy.  They had such a small serving of mash and collard greens that came with the 9pc bucket.

The beignets were pillowy yet substantial, came out hot but not oily at all. mmmm. the sugar wasn't too much or too sweet, so it was not at all cloying and heavy and didn't make me feel fat before my main meal. thumbs up.\n\nchicken and waffles has been my top craving these past few days, and i am now satisfied. chicken pieces were not as big as i was expecting them to be - but then again, i'm too much of a glutton for anyone's good - but the dish comes with three pieces, and so it does fill up a normal human being's appetite. hot and juicy on the inside, with crispy skin that stayed crisp even after i drench it all in syrup and hot sauce. DELISHUZZ. the waffle was okay, not the best i've had,  but i appreciated the natural sweetness of it (a hint of vanilla in the batter?) and it excellently soaked up my syrup+butter+hot sauce pool. DELISHUZZ.\n\nR. had the country ham with red eye gravy, that came with two eggs whichever way you like them, and homefries. she finished up her food, so i take it that she enjoyed her meal as much as i did. had a couple of pieces of her potatoes, and they were just okay in my books.\n\nthe iced coffee was pretty weak in itself, but refills are free and it goes refreshingly well with the heavy meal. don't expect the robustness of that cup of blue bottle you usually get with your sweet morning pastry is all.\n\nwill come back again for other goodies and to relish in the interior of the place. must remember to look effortlessly hip the next time, instead of rolling in with eating pants and unplucked eyebrows.", "author": "Eliza D."}

The textures are still perfect but there is no flavor in the batter or in the meat. It used to be salty spicy and delicious. Please consider changing the recipe or at least offering a more flavorful variation. The fried green tomatoes were very stiff, not at the the tender and juicy flesh of a properly ripe and cooked green tomato.\n\nAnd the service, dear lord, the service... It has gone way down hill. I know that there are off nights, but I have noticed a slow, steady spiral downward in service here. Last night we were told 30-45 minutes, off by about 20 minutes more. There was no concern shown about our hunger or patience. No \"thanks for waiting,\" or \"Sorry about the extra wait.\" I have worked in restaurants and bars for years and find this unacceptable. But, I was hungry and hopeful, so I let it go. I had also raved about this place to my dining companions and wanted it to live up to its reputation.\n\nThe restaurant was not extra busy and yet we waited and waited and waited. We did not order drinks, appetizers or dessert and yet we sat there for 2 hours, only 30 minutes of which was actually eating. Again, there was no explanation for the long waits for our food, for our check, for our change. There was no apology, no effort to check in with us, nothing. \nAt one point, our server brought by an amuse bouche (about 45 minutes after we had been waiting seated at the table) after the cornbread and with no explanation about why we were getting it. \n\nDespite our incredible patience, at the end of our meal there was no exit greeting, \"Thank you for being patient\" or \"Thanks for coming in\" or \"I hope you enjoyed your meal.\" The service was sloppy, very sloppy, and confusing. I'm not sure there was a manager on site since everyone working there seemed to be sauntering around, chatting with themselves and other customers.\n\nI am sad to say that the Southern hospitality I could count on that made the Front Porch stand out among its competitors is gone.", "author": "G Z."}

They sure know how to dress up the place what with its already-dim-dark-deep restaurant decor and Southern feel. The service was attentive. The food was yummy! The menu is on the gently-overpriced side but worth it if you're not strapped for cash. It's not enough for me to make the trip back though for a repeat meal but I wouldn't complain if a friend organized a meeting meal there. We ordered, as usual, WAY TOO MUCH! But it gave me a good feel for the food they served. \n\nThey started off with a little cute cup of butternut squashy pumpkin soup. The soup was smooth and the veggies had a very savory flavor. It was very nice. And complimentary! I'm not sure if it was a Halloween treat or if they do this as a norm.\n\nThen we got the cornbread. WOW! We loved it! I just wish we had more. The cornbread came in cute little long cookie-style packages. It wasn't your usual slice a square of cornbread thing. It was as if they baked the cornbread in those fancy metal cookie pans. Very cute! Very tasty! OH SO YUMMY! And it came with this savory butter sauce too!\n\nWe got the fried clam coleslaw roll. Not too bad. Too much bread and too little clam. But the clams that was there were full-bellied and crisp and delicious! The bread was good too. \n\nThe baked mac and cheese was a crowd-pleaser! We LOVED! They piled on tons of high-quality cheese in a piping hot clay bowl. The waiter kindly warned us that the plate was HOT. AND IT WAS HOT! It was still steaming a good 10 minutes after. I like that the clay pot kept our mac toasty! VERY RICH though! Whew!\n\nWe got a bucket of fried chicken. Now, I love fried chicken like nobody's business but I have to say that their fried chicken wasn't what I expected. It had a lemony essence going on there in their chicken. I love lemon. I love fried chicken. I'm not 100% sure that I love them together. I'm more into the savory spicy thick glazy fried chicken stuff. The fried chicken at Farmer Brown, for instance, rocks my socks. It's different here though. Judging from others, it looks like the fried chicken here rocked their socks. So I guess it's a personal preference of how you like your chicken fried. If you're into lemon, you'll probably love this! Kudos to the chef for not OVER-frying it. It was crispy to perfection with just enough flavor from the oil to sink into the meat. They do know their technique! \n\nWe had the collard greens and mashed potato with gravy. YUMMY YUMMY!  The desserts looked scrumptious but we couldn't order. Stuffed to the brim!

It's hard to find a good restaurant scene when 9 o'clock rolls around in SF, but tucked away on 29th street is this lively gem.\n\nScore another point for the sides.  A little on the small side for Southern standards, but the baked mac& cheese, fried okra, collared greens and corn 'bread' works.  I dare say, with the local ingredients here, it can give a bunch of places in Louisiana a run for the money.\n\nUnfortunately, the main courses failed.  Popeye's has better fried chicken, which isn't saying much.  I miss good ol' Southern buttermilk fried chicken, where the meat sticks to the skin and all that flavor in the fat mixed with the spices makes your belly remember the meal for months.  The fried chicken here was ok, but not worth the $20.  The po boy was a 'wet' one -- perhaps it originated from a part of the South that I'm not used to. It was a good sandwich -- just not a New Orleans po boy.  It was more like stir fried shrimp slathered onto a loaf of bread.\n\nMy biggest pet peeve?  The gumbo.  I tasted salt.  I really wanted to like the gumbo, but this one lacked the subtlety of good (or even average) gumbo.  Not enough rice, no zing and some shriveled sausage medallions.  It was watery, and I don't know what the roux consisted of, but it sure wasn't anything I recognized.\n\nThe desserts were a saving grace -- but they can't really mess up root beer floats and bread pudding -- especially when they got your ice cream down the block from Mitchell's.\n\nA definite missed opportunity for the Bay.

I think the worst thing is that they let a mariachi band come in and play a few songs during dinner.  This place is super small, usually packed, and it's already really loud, so when you add obnoxious music it can be impossible to have a conversation.  Plus the musicians hit you up for tips afterwards which is a really tacky thing for the restaurant to let them do.  I understand that the musicians are trying to make a living, but hey, the music doesn't match the atmosphere and I didn't ask for it.\n\nThe food here is ok.  I've been several times and it always seems to be over-salted.  It can also be on the greasy side--even for fried food.  On the other hand, there just aren't that many places to get fried okra in San Francisco, and I'm pretty much in love with fried okra, so I make it back every couple months for a hit.  They also do excellent jalape\u00f1o poppers, hush puppies, cornbread, and have a decent beer/wine list.

This is the second time I've been to the Front Porch and both times have been great. I heard about this place from a coworker when he told me they serve fried chicken and 40's, but the food was great. We got there a little before they opened and the woman in the front told us that if we came back right at opening, we could probably get a table, but that they were booked for the night. This place is pretty small, so a reservation is essential.\n\nBoth times my boyfriend and I went, we ordered the Bucket O' Chicken, with sides of baked mac and cheese and biscuits. GET THE BISCUITS. They do give you little cornbread style muffins with spicy butter which are good, but these biscuits are fantastic. They're served with rosemary butter and a cranberry jam, and the second time we ordered a second round.  The mac and cheese is also great. Cooked and served in a small cast iron skillet, it came to the table still bubbling. I'm pretty picky about my mac and cheese, I much prefer it with a smooth cheesyness (not that grainy texture homemade mac and cheese often has) and this one has a little of both, but it's definitely more on the smooth side.  Now the fried chicken. They serve it in an actual KFC style bucket, filled with popcorn on the bottom. It is super crispy and unmistakably juicy. I would definitely recommend it.  All of the food we have had is so well made. We had an ordering dilemma this time, thinking we should try something else on the menu, but decided we like the place so much that we'll just come back and definitely try something different next time.\n\nAs for the drinks, well the first time we got the 40s of King Cobra, of course. For such a cute and trendy restaurant, there is something so fun about eating fried chicken out of a bucket and drinking on a 40.  The second time we decided to class it up a bit. The boyfriend got the blonde bock beer. Their draft beer selection is very small, but they chose local and strong. I got the Porch Swing because you shouldn't be hanging out in the south without some bourbon in your hand. It is bourbon and cointreau with fresh orange and lime juice and a sugar rim.  It was strong enough to taste the bourbon, but not so overpowering to make it difficult to drink.\n\nThe two deciding factors on what makes a great restaurant for me are 1. I can't wait to come back and 2. I trust the chef with any item on the menu.  The Front Porch meets both of these criteria.", "author": "Heather B."}

It had a slight lemon/citrus taste which was really nice and helped to balance out the heavier, saltier spices that were added to the perfectly battered fried skin. \n\nThe sides of mashed potatoes and green beans were great as well. The green beans were cooked just right, crunchy but not under done. Whatever they used to season them were fantastic, I kept reaching over to serve myself more. The potatoes were good but not necessarily rave worthy. Since my friends and I were so retardedly hungry, we also ordered a side of fried okra and mac'n'cheese. The okra was only okay, they were cut too small and the batter was the type you find on fried Twinkies at county fairs. The mac was also only okay, as it needed an extra kick of something...it mostly tasted like cream and noodles. \n\nAgain with the waiting though. When we arrived close to 10 pm, there were still a good amount of people waiting to be seated. Upon the suggestion of the manager, we put our name down and then walked down the block to a little sports-themed dive bar to have a drink while we waited. However, the wait was much quicker than anticipated, as we were just served our drinks and we received a call that our table was ready. \n\nAnd here's where I learned something new while in the bay, the concept of a \"roadie\".

A bucket of chicken (9 pieces) was about $35 , but this does come with collard greens & mash potatoes with gravy.  Everything else was the same...small portions (think tapas) and not so small prices.\n2.  this joint is small.  This means that reservations are a must!\n\nThe food was yummmy.  To date..this is the best fried chicken in SF!  The ambiance of the restaurant was so cool with local art on the walls (for sale...also very hefty prices), live music, and a full bar with very fun cocktails.  I could do without the dim lighting though..I like to see my food!  \n\nOkay, back to the food.  There were four adults and one three year old in our group.  We had the mac n cheese (this is a must try!...yumm..) It's the kind of mac n cheese where the cheese is stringing off of your fork as you pick it up. \n\nWe also had the fried okras.  I usually don't like okra because of the texture, but this was yummy.  The three year old hates veggies, and he loved these okras!  \n\nWe had the fried pickles...not a fan.  It tastes just as you would imagine it.  salty and tangy, but not in the yummy salt & vinegar chips kind of way!\n\nWe had the sweet potato fries...the fries weren't as crispy as I'd like them to be, but they were yummy anyway.  I am bias though because I love french fries (in any shape and form!)\n\nAnd we had the corn dog.  HUGE corn dog, but the batter tasted burnt. I wouldn't do this again. \n\nGo here.

Perhaps the influence of tequila at the International Club across the street played a role. Whatever it may have been, my dining experience at The Front Porch was divine.\n\nAs usual, boyfriend and I ordered too much food. It is easy to get anxious about trying all the classics and quickly realizing you've ordered enough for a small army. But there are just some things you *have* to try in a place like this. For me, having grown up around Southerners and my grandma's cheesy grits, it was imperative that I try things like Gumbo, hush-puppies and grits. Plus throw in some fried chicken and the vegan special - oh, and more wine.\n\nEverything was delicious. The Gumbo was a surprising HIT in my mouth. Gumbo is hard to get right, really hard and these guys nailed it. The portion was HUGE though, so beware.\n\nHush Puppies - oh yeh, I love me some fried dough. Basically a rounded beignet with savory remoulade.\n\nSpicy shrimp grits: holy f**k. A delectable dish, my favorite of the evening.\n\nBy this point I was FULL and could not consume much more. A couple of bites of fried chicken just to taste, which was juicy, crunchy and spiced just right, as well as the exceptional and shockingly good vegan special. I am not adverse to eating simple vegetables, as a matter of fact I love them, but I tend to shy away from vegan menu items because people are always trying to *fake* other ingredients and flavors. Not this time - this was a true celebration of onion, tomato, fava beans and black eyed peas. Really nice dish.\n \nThe chicken proved to be a really great walking-home-drizzunk-at-2am-after-Dovre kind of treat, so definitely take some left-overs home.\n\nCan't wait to go back.

And the food continues to be marvelous.\n\nSpanky & I put our names on the list, and started off at the bar, with a carafe of a lovely Chinon. Our table was ready in about 10 minutes, and we sauntered over, glass in hand, and were immediately taken under the wing of our friendly and competent server.  Spanky admired the decor; I admired Spanky. So far, so good.\n\nThe Meal\n\nAfter much debate, we settled on getting far too much, in order to taste all we wanted. A starter of steak tartare with quail egg, mustard, caperberries, radish and arugula (unctuous, full of textured silkiness, lovely) and a plate of asparagus with fried prosciutto, poached egg, and a light hollandaise (really lovely combination of textures and flavors), and then moved onto mains -- although at this point we were already starting to feel a bit full.\n\nOur glasses being empty, we hailed back to the bar. Spanky replenished her Chinon with a remarkably healthy pour from the bartender (perhaps he overheard her commenting on his attractive demeanor), and for me a cask conditioned, whiskey-barrel aged porter. And these went exceptionally well with our choices of the fried chicken (still stellar) and the rabbit with morels (the rabbit light, the mushrooms almost overwhelmingly decadent), with sides of plantain and fried okra.\n\nHoly cow, how did we think we could eat this much????\n\nSo we closed out with a digestif --- a lovely root beer float (I know, I know) and coffee.

The mac and cheese is absolutely, sinfully delicious, albeit somewhat oily from the amount of yummy, yummy cheese it has. \n\nHowever, I was pretty underwhelmed by the chicken itself. It appeared to be over-fried on purpose so it was almost unappealingly crispy and, in my humble opinion, over-seasoned too.

Also, the mashed potatoes and greens were just aight for me - not really that flavorful.\n\nWhat I'm really looking for in a fried chicken joint is better fried chicken than I can make myself - because it's a good amount of messy work and I'd gladly pay to have it done for me.

I had heard good things about the place, and I love Cajun food, so I was really looking forward to it.  Although the atmosphere was fun, and I loved being able to find a place to park, I was a little disappointed.  When I think of Cajun, I think of stewed stuff like gumbo and jambalaya, blackened catfish and loads of sauces.  They had some that on the side, but it seemed that burgers and fried chicken is more of the restaurant's forte.  Just putting hot sauce (and bacon) on something doesn't make it Cajun.  We ended up splitting a green salad and the fried chicken dinner.  The salad sounded great in the description (pears and grapefruit slices, etc), but it was kind of blah. The dressing seemed to lack something.  And, the lettuce was composed of the toughest, most bitter leaves... that's the part you give to the rabbit or the compost.  The chicken was nothing to come back for.  My friend liked it, but wouldn't go there just for that.  The sides that came with it - the collard greens, mashed potatoes and gravy were the best part for me.  Oh, they also gave us cornbread, which was a plate of easy-bake oven sized muffins - just 2.  I'm telling, you, if I ever run a restaurant, I would never skimp on the small stuff, not at the prices like they charge. I didn't order the shrimp because I was afraid I'd only get 5 prawns.  We also ordered the bread pudding, which was fabulous.  Great bourbon sauce... mmm.\n\nThe bar was a little disappointing, because they don't stock a lot of liqueurs that are necessary to make certain cocktails.  If you stick to their own bar menu or the simple stuff, you're OK.  Now the bar across the street (which the restaurant owns) is completely the opposite, well-stocked and with a knowledgeable bartender.  We had gone there first, and had a great time.  My suggestion is for the restaurant is to lose the in-house bar, put in more tables, and lower their prices because they won't need to carry the expensive full-bar expense.  But, I'm sure they won't make any changes until they aren't filling tables anymore.  The place was packed, and noisy, even for a Wed. night, so word has gotten out well for them.  The service was also really good, so no complaints there.

The burger is so on point too!! I'm surprised there aren't more reviews on the burger - seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly. I'm not usually a fries person, but the fries that came with the burger are maybe the best I've ever had. Shrimp and grits were delicious! I've never had grits but OMG - the buttery cheesy goodness and texture was amazing. The shrimp were also delicious. Although, the dish was so rich I probably would never be able to eat a whole order by myself. The biscuits are SO GOOD. And the Rosemary butter they come with is crazy delicious too. I literally would only give my bf one bite of them bc they were so good! The fried chicken was good but I'm not really a fried chicken person so I'd probably stick with the burger next time. My bf loved the greens they came with and he ate all of the mashed potatoes. The Mac and cheese was also good, but very cheesy and not too many noodles. Not the best I've ever had but still good. We ordered deep fried bacon on it too, but I ended up peeling off the fried portion to put some normal bacon on my Mac and cheese - deep fried was just too much.,Was seated fast and the staff was so nice!

Then I saw it on Check Please Bay Area, which gave it some mixed reviews. The only downside I could tell, in agreement from one review on CBBA, is that it isn't the best spot for kids. It's small and packed. Which is a good thing for the restraunteurs. But it had a great vibe and the hostess, bartender and waitstaff were friendly and helpful. \n\nI went alone and sat at the bar for dinner. I wasn't too hungry, but really wanted to try the place out. I had the fried okra with jalapeno lime aioli appetizer, which was good. I didn't expect too much from it, but I think it could have used a little more salt and overall zing. I had the spicy shrimp with andouille sausage app too. The sauce it was in was hearty and delicious. It wasn't as spicy as I had imagined. When I mentioned that to the hostess, she brought out three bottles of their hot sauce with varying degrees of heat. I could easily pass on the mild sauce, but the habanero and the ghost pepper sauces were perfect!

And that, my friends, is the life of a yelper, the mission to try new places, especially those recommended by others or in yelp terms are 4+ stars!\n\nAnd to my surprise, it's actually not that far from what I originally thought.  oh the anticipation of coming up to the place where you've heard so much about, not knowing what to expect, what's it look outside, and inside.  When we got here, I think the first thing that came to mind was the restaurant reminded me of New Orleans in Disneyland....very cajun, dark, and seems like the spot to be to eat, drink, and be merry.\n\nAlthough the prices are a little high, there are certainly some things worth eating and trying. We had the following:\n\n-Fried Okra - a must.  If you know what okra is and how the awesome gooeyness of it is, then no doubt, having it fried and dipped in some cream sauce is exactly that much better.\n\n-Brussel Sprouts with lemon juice - I know a lot of people don't like brussel sprouts, but if you had it made like this, you'd love it.  Perfect spice and lemon zest.\n\n-Fried Yucca with garlic sauce - pretty much just another type of garlic fries, but then the yucca is funny.  You need to eat it early before it turns all hard, but overall, I can do without this one.\n\n-Oyster Beignets - didn't know what to expect, but it was certainly good.  we were unsure what the bottom patty thing was but its a bread pudding that complimented the fried oyster really well.  Definitely deserving a redo.\n\n-Shrimp and grits - they make the awesomest grits with this candied gravy-ish sauce topped over.  I think this is my favorite dish thus far.\n\n-Steak Special with squash fries - steak was tender but a tad small.  I'd prefer a larger piece and less squash fries although the entire plate had everything inculding some veggies at the bottom.\n\nDefinitely would want to come back, but perhaps not indulge as much and try a dish every so often.

My southern wife was similarly ecstatic about the fried okra. In fact, when we were there celebrating her finished dissertation or sumtin she got a little tipsy and ordered more okra for dessert. Being a naive idiot, I tried to stop her, but she belligerently demanded them. Apparently she became a bit of a cause celebre in the kitchen when she wolfed them down. We went there for her birthday not long thereafter, and I had the waitress bring her a bowl of okra with a candle in it for dessert. Anyway, you get the picture, special place.\n\nBut apparently a new chef has taken over, and for some crazy reason replaced the liquid gold with shrimp and grits, a sad imitation of their glorious past.

Parking is horrible, but that is nothing new in SF.\nLove, love, love the atmosphere! Very fun; hodgepodge of garbage all over the walls! Dark with highlights of red bulbs and that sort, very vintage look even though this place has only been there for 3 years. It's so in and new to look so old. My favorite part of the atmosphere? All the facial hair in that place! Man, the side burns and handlebar mustachios on the guys that were in that restaurant were off the chart! \n\n+ Cornbread (complimentary)\nIt's in the shape of corn on the cob!!! Warm, soft, AND it had coarse kosher salt on top. Yum. It's really worth asking/begging them to bring another plate over.\n\n- Sauteed shrimp, bacon, mushrooms and garlic over grits, $11 for app, $18 for entree\nNo no no no no! The shrimp was cooked well, and the grits was creamy and well done but all of it was ruined under a 1/4\" layer of red grease. I thought, maybe I'm not fancy or southern enough to appreciate this dish but I had everyone else at the table try it and everyone was awkwardly silent afterward (as in, no oohs and ahhs) until Marc was basically like \"dude, that's gross and greasy\". When I asked the waitress, she looked confused and said that there's a sauce on it. Oh dear. Anyway, she graciously took it off the tab, which I am grateful for. \n\n- Fried Catfish with hush puppies, coleslaw, and sweet potato fries $16.50\nRubbery fish. Dry, stale hush puppies. Soggy sweet potato fries. :(\n\n- Fried oyster salad $?\nSomeone ordered this and it was so gross. The tangy dressing did not match the oyster and the oysters tainted everything in that dish with its hotness and oiliness, leaving anything fresh in its path in a wilted, oily, lukewarm mess.\n\n+ Fried chicken $16.75 for a couple pieces or $33.33 for 9 pcs\nThe batter was greasy, yet coarsely crunchy without any tasty spices. BUT the actual chicken meat was awesomely moist. The meat must have been rubbed (under the skin) with crushed processed/canned garlic because it had that fragrant bite of garlic yet a little duller than the fresh stuff. I liked it. In terms of uniqueness or value, I dunno...the fast food joints are tasty, yet definitely not the quality ingredients and natural meat as the Front Porch.\n\n+/- Local ground beef burger, bacon, cheddar, house made pickles, porch fries. $16.75 \nYour average burger. What I would expect, although the bun was soft, moist and fluffy and the fries, fried and seasoned to perfection.\n\n+ Fried okra with jalapeno aioli $4\nI really liked this. Got it as a starter for everyone to share. Not greasy at all, but fried with a tasty cornmealy batter and the aioli was smooth with just a little kick.", "author": "Diana D."}

I already knew what I was going to try out.  I thought it was somewhat pricey but I had to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Like everyone else said, this place is SUPER dark inside.  I guess it just depends if that's your kind of thing.  I personally am a vampire so I felt right at home.  I went with my bf and my friend and we ordered the gumbo, the bucket of chicken, and the mac & cheese.  They gave us complimentary cornbread which I thought was nice.  It was somewhat dry but they gave us a cheese spread to put on it to compensate I suppose.  The gumbo was satisfactory.  I asked for no okra and they told me it's already in there so I had to deal and just not eat it.  The rice was grainy and there wasn't even any seafood in it but it still cost $8.50.  Rip off.  The bucket of chicken was even more of a rip off.  $34 for 9 pieces of crunchy but SUPER-DRY chicken, with pieces of popcorn in the bucket.  I asked for gravy on the side and they charged me $1 extra.  They should be giving gravy on the side for free to make up for their UNDER-SEASONED, SUPER-DRY CHICKEN!

I admire Front Porch for trying to support the community, but they should pay the mariachi and request that he not solicit patrons for tips when you're paying $33 for a bucket of chicken.  If he were a little more gracious, that would have been okay.  But he hung out at a nearby table that was ignoring his requests for five minutes hoping they would cough up something.  We would have preferred the CD that was playing.  \n\nAlso, I asked for bread, and our server said, \"we have cornbread,\" but still didn't bring it out.  Is there some code language I need to know to get bread?  \n\nAnyway, the food is reasonably priced for the quantity they give you and being in SF, besides the accompaniments to the fried chicken, which were a little small.  The fried okra was really good, perfectly salted and fresh.  The lime jalapeno aioli missed the mark - it was slimy and did not seem to go with the okra.\n\nI loved that the fried chicken is presented in a popcorn tub with some popcorn that absorbs some of the chicken fat and gets much tastier as the night goes on.  They just staple the bucket up with your leftovers, and I appreciate the minimal waste.  The fried chicken was really moist and tasted like it had been marinated in citrus for hours.  \n\nThey were out of the green beans, so it came with collard greens and mashed potatoes.   Both were good, but this portion was really stingy for a dish meant to serve more than 2 people.", "author": "Amy D."}

My tastebuds are highly critical of anything that doesn't come out of mama's kitchen, and I for sure would not expect some hotshot restaurant from San Francisco (of all places) to impress. Well, The Front Porch does just that and it may be the best fried chicken in this city.\n\nThat's what I would say if I really was from the South and actually knew what real fried chicken is supposed to taste like.\n\nWell, I am Bay Area born and raised, and the extent of my fried chicken expertise pretty much ends with KFC's Original or Crispy. What I do know, is that the fried chicken served in a popcorn bucket (popcorn included) from The Front Porch is some of the best I've ever had. I'm very easy to please, but fried chicken must possess two distinct qualities: crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Anything else is just a bonus. The Front Porch does both incredibly well. The skin is perfectly seasoned and crispy, and the meat is mouth wateringly juicy and flavorful. \n\nI went with a group of friends, and we shared a couple buckets of chicken with mashed potatoes, collard greens, and fried yucca with aioli, which were all very good as well. We washed it down with some Rose sangria, which is made by the glass per order. Though very refreshing and fruity, I regretted not ordering an ice cold beer instead to go with my fried chicken.

We also got the biscuts.  \n\nDessert: pecan pie and 4 barrel coffee.\n\nWe didn't leave hungry, but both of us were miffed at how we dropped $117 dollars for 2 drinks and a fried chicken dinner.  The blue crab fritters were tasty.  The chicken was also very good, but at $33 dollars/bucket, not even close to being priced reasonably. Our biscuts were $6. You get only 2. They were tiny and dry.  The pie was terrible and at $7.00 for a micro slice also over priced. The coffee tasted burnt and was on par with Denny's. We know what chickory is...  But that wasn't it. Poor!\n\nOverall, we were not satisfied with the quality of the food we were served. Just about everything there is over priced, and some items tasteless for what you get and are paying for. In addition, street parking is hard to come by and we almost gave up after looking for a space for over 30 min. I wish we wouldn't have found a spot after this experience.

I've given it much thought, and a solid fried chicken joint is hard to come by, especially in San Francisco. I'm not looking for fast food or for a place that simply serves it, I just want a place that does it, and does it WELL.\n\nEUREKA!\n\nThe Front Porch is a tiny bustling restaurant in Bernal Heights that probably seats no more than 50 people. We came around 8pm on a Sunday and got a table within minutes of waiting at the bar. The party of four behind us weren't as lucky. Come prepared for a wait and have a backup plan for dinner if you're impatient. As mentioned, they don't take reservations for parties under five. Ideal for couples or small parties. It's very loud, dark and has a \"divey\" quality to it. The staff is outfitted in the typical trendy but unique vintage Mission hipster fashion and they're very nice.\n\nThe menu is diverse, with daily seafood and vegan specials, spruced up with a fresh perspective of Southern favorites, with a nice selection of beers, local and from abroad (they even have King Cobra), and wine. The little gem salad was decent with a very bitter and strong dressing. I felt it was a little lacking and could have used some shaved parmesan or asiago on top to counteract the bite of the dressing. The Bermudian callaloo soup appetizer was hearty and loaded with lobster, greens, seedy whole pieces of okra and onions. It was the perfect cold day soup and I would definitely order it again.\n\nNow onto the chicken. The chicken, the chicken, the fried mo'fockin' chicken. The fried exterior is thicker than your normal fried batter, clearly well peppered and spiced. Thicker as in it's more like a shell, rather than a mass of fried matter like at Popeyes nor very delicate like a tempura batter. It flakes off in small sheets, instead of crumbs. Albeit, my tastebuds were a little hindered with a cold, but I could still tell the fried shell packed a powerful punch. Not overly spicy at all. Every piece was cooked to juicy perfection; dark meat and white meat alike. Nothing was overcooked nor dried out. It doesn't need sauce, but The Front Porch will provide you with some of the spiciest orange habanero secret sauces around. It is ON FIRE. A spec had me sniffling, and a dip had me nearly chugging water straight from the bottle. It's not a joke. Less is more, people. The green onion mashed potatoes were good, as were the green beans, and I never got to the wax beans beneath the mashed potatoes, because for me it was all about the chicken. It is just so good.\n\nNice find.", "author": "Chelsea P."}

Our daughter, who lives in SF, brought each of uis a cup of Phil's Coffee to try. Our wait staff didn't complain - just said \"OK, you have to bring enough for everyone!\".  Thoroughly enjoyable and a perfect start to our San Francisco holiday,  Thank you to Yelp for posting the reviews that were used in our selection of this fabulous establishment!!!", "author": "Deanna U."}

Living with dane brammage can be difficult. Strangers sometimes find me uncomfortable to be around, mostly because of the giggling. One of two things happens in these interactions, people are either annoyed or gracious when dealing with me. \n\nThe people at The Front Porch are gracious. They went way out of their way to help me with my picnic. They even let me borrow silverware. We got the chicken bucket that came with cornbread, grits and black eyed peas. For about $40 (including tip) I fed four people. The only thing I regret is that I forgot to ask for the black eyed peas to be non-piglet, so I didn't get to try it. The people who did loved it. Everything was delicious. \n\nIf it weren't for the crappy ass weather at Holly Park, we could have enjoyed the music and films and it would have been a perfect Saturday.

Sadly, you Dear Reader (and for purposes of this review) just haven't earned Most Honored And Favorite Super-Yelper status, else I'd have finessed The Front Porch's high-end take on soul food  down your palette instead of hers.

But I digress.\n\n[[SF/X: Patsy Cline, Walkin' After Midnight]]\n\nIf the Front Porch is offering some stank, skanky vegetable, all candied up and slathered in bacon, get it. Don't sleep. They turn funky old green vegetables into a donkey ride to heaven. Though they no longer offer their roasted candied brussel sprouts as a starter, I get an email alert  when they're back in season. I could eat them like bon-bons, all slick in a silk robe watching daytime soaps while part-time models serve me deliciously stinky brussel sprouts. \n\nThey keep a 40 oz. of King Cobra on the spirits list. For the life of me I can't figure what food would go with King Cobra (too masking, even for grits and greens, though probably perfect with their corn-shaped corn bread appetizers), I opt instead for the Persephone, a bio-dynamic or whatever hard cider with pomegranite juice and fruit. Sangria style cider. Not too sweet and I think I smell newly-mown grass. \"Get the part-time models back here, we've filled another tray\".\n\nRumor has it their shake 'n' bake recipe sits safely in a locked vault in a satellite orbiting 1000s of miles above the bayou. The best shake 'n' bake I've ever had. It should be called shank 'n' bake, because it will mess you up.\n\nNext time I come here, I hereby carve in stone that I'll try whatever the vegan special is and drink tons of their juice-box wine.

Not backing us up on Talk threads or sending us enough compliments. We have no self esteem and rely on social networking sites to pick up the slack from our incompetent parents. It was imperative we meet. \r\n\r\nWe decided meet at The Front Porch, which was the perfect backdrop to discuss the aforementioned topics and also to discuss Yelp Royalty concerns like making people add us as their fan, deleting talk threads and discussing how we were morally superior for having join dates in 2005.

Just two of us, so even easier to get a table. I would probably only come here with five or fewer.\n\nDrinks: I forget the name of what I ordered. MANDARIN something with kumquat. It was refreshing and tasty. D had the KIR ROYALE - black currant liquor and champagne.  We love our black currant liquor.\n\nAll food was shared between the two of us. \n\nStarters: CORN BREAD w/ chili butter, SPICY CRAB & GRITS with peas, scallions, and lemon butter. Fantastic. Yum. Creamy, crabby goodness. D likes neither peas nor grits, and yet she licked the dish clean. It was THAT good. PICKLED SALAD served on a Chinese soup spoon. From the kitchen, they told us - thanks!\n\nMain Courses: MISS OLLIE'S FRIED CHICKEN with garlic potatoes [w/ something pickled] and sauteed spicy spinach [replaced the Bajan coleslaw]. Extra crispy skin, moist and tender meat on the inside. FISH CUTTER [changes daily], which happened to be a fried oyster sandwich, with fries [zesty ketchup, similar to a BBQ sauce] and macaroni pie [not very cheesy]. By the time we got to this entree, we were stuffed. We managed to finish the sandwich [fried oysters = YUM!].\n\nService: Friendly, speedy, accommodating, awesome. They warned us about the house-made hot sauce [habanero!]. That shit is spicy. I dare not touch it, but D can vouch for that one.\n\nLeft with: No room for dessert. One piece of fried chicken. Some garlic potatoes. A lot of macaroni pie. Some fries. A Front Porch matchbook. A Front Porch sticker.\n\n$$: Reasonably priced for leaving ridiculously stuffed and with lunch for the next day. \n\nApproximate Departure Time: 7:35pm.

Why do you think everything is bigger in the south?  And I'm not talking about peaches, son.  I'm talking about thighs, cankles and spare tires.  If they aren't BIG, then you are doing something wrong, and by wrong I mean, lay off the salads and have some red beans and rice for godsake.\n\nThe Front Porch has embraced the bigger is better philosophy, and is working really hard to make me fat (fatter?).\n\nOut to dinner with six of the hottest ladies I know, we shocked and awed the other patrons by ordering a round of tall boy Red Stripes and taking them down like it was not our job, but our god given duty.\n\nFeeling buzzed, we then proceeded to dive into the eating portion of the event.  \n\nWaldorf Salad (walnuts on the side -- Hi Nance), Corn and White Fish Fritters, two Buckets of Fried Chicken, Crab and Grits, Macaroni Pie, Black Eyed Peas, Collards and Mustard Greens all done up Family Style, cause the girls that share together, get nice and fat together and live together with their 7 cats later in life when no one wants them and they can eat frosting out of the can free of judgment together.\n\nWe finished everything -- save four pieces of AMAZING fried chicken.  And if you looked real hard, you could see me and my Texan friend sopping up the leftover grits with pieces of chicken skin.  \n\nUmmm, yeah.

There is a down home and local sort of feel, and what I liked was the surprising dearth of hipsters. Just a lot of people from the neighborhood, ourselves excluded. Our bartender was cool if a little lackadaisical, but that seemed to go fine with the laid back vibe.\n\nWhen our table was ready, we were seated in a somewhat tight booth, but still pretty comfortable.Our waiter arrived, seemingly breathless, just to tell us that five other tables were also sitting down now and that it would be a bit before he got back to us. Um, what?\n\nSo this became the theme of the night: \n\"You want water, no problem.\" It arrives fifteen minutes later.\n\"It's so busy, but I'll be right back. I have five tables to serve!\"\n\"Don't try this dish, not that good, and we might be out of it.\"\n\nItems arrived sporadically, and in the case of our potatoes, not at all. The corn bread was pretty good, but not salted enough. The Bucket of Fried Chicken was my favorite thing on the menu, but just not enough of a reason to frequent the place (A bucket comes with 2 sides, although for $29, this ain't no Popeyes!). Maybe I'd sit at the bar and split an order with a buddy - or try their Porch Burger -over a bottle or two of St. Peter's Ale or something...\n\nSo while the food could be improved here and there, and I'm sure they'll get into their stride (the grilled steak with roasted fresno chilies seems worth a return trip), it was our service that really brought down our experience.

In this case, however, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, since the other two members of my party besides my wife and me arrived quite late, and the hostess, who was absolutely delightful and accommodating, made sure we were well cared for.  My wife and I had the salt cod fritters, which were hot, delicious, soft, and moist, along with a large bottle of Duvel, the combination of which quickly eased our initial annoyance at the 45-minute wait to be seated (the hostess' estimate; our actual wait would have been shorter but for our friends' tardiness).  We were able to have our appetizer and beer on the patio, which allowed us to avoid having to crowd at the bar.\n\nThe Front Porch's other sin, revealed once we were seated, was that they had allowed a mariachi player to infest the restaurant.  Mariachi is my least favorite form of music on Earth, so not everyone may find this as much of a disadvantage.  Fortunately, he only played one or two songs, asked for money (which I might have given him in order to prevent him from playing), and then left before we started eating.\n\nMy wife and I split the bucket of chicken, which was enough not only for dinner but for subsequent lunches as well.  I can't recall the wine we ordered, but it was fruity and well-suited to the nouveau soul food.  The chicken came with red beans and rice, both of which were also quite satisfying.  Our companions were in the midst of an argument, so I can't say whether they enjoyed their meals, per se, but they did get doggie bags.  We were all too full for dessert, unfortunately.\n\nOverall, the experience was very pleasant and just the thing for a chilly night.", "author": "Bitter J."}

There are always specials, be it ceviche, entree or sangria and a changing vegan entree. Mini corn-shaped corn bread is brought out with honey chili butter. If you thought butter was delicious before, try it with honey and chili. I want to put this stuff on EVERYTHING! Also, mini things in general are awesome. I like to pretend that instead of things being small, that I am actually abnormally large. What? You don't do that? Oh, OK, I'M the weirdo.

It's worth it.  \r\n\r\nPart 1:  The Wait\r\nManaged to score a table with some rocking chairs on the \"porch\" section just outside the front door of the restaurant.  Ordered a bottle of cidre doux, a few beers, and some snacks to tide us over.\r\nRock, Talk, Munch, Drink, Rock, Talk, Munch, Drink.\r\n\r\nSweet & Spicy Nuts - really good, toasted nuts covered in a layer of powdered sugar and spices.\r\n\r\nChicken Liver & Mount Gay Rum Pate - if you like chopped liver, you will probably love this dish.  I love chopped liver.  Not crazy about the mango preserves served with it, but enjoyed all of the other flavors very much.\r\n\r\nPart 2:  Supper\r\nWe were seated in a cozy booth along the side of the restaurant.  I liked everything about the ambiance, from the tin ceilings to the blue painted walls to the lace curtain above the kitchen area.  It feels very Deep South, in a dripping-with-Spanish moss, Low-Country way.  Think Patsy Cline on the stereo (although we heard Tom Waits, too).  But this is definitely an urban Southern experience - as the place hustles and buzzes, with plate after plate leaving the kitchen and making their way to the hungry diners.\r\n\r\nCorn Bread - made in the cast-iron corn molds that you often see at flea markets - in the shape of corn!  Those kinds of details make me very happy.  Served with jalapeno butter.\r\n\r\nSalt Cod with Cod Fritters- this was a special appetizer, and it was so good.  The Fritters were unlike any other I've had - light and savory.\r\nThe Salt Cod was tender with a drizzle of lemon oil for a citrusy richness.\r\n\r\nMiss Ollie's Organic Fried Chicken - mmmm, mmmm!  We got a whole bucket to share, and it is so tender and juicy, like the buttermilk-soaked kind that your grandmama used to make (like I WISH mine had).  The seasoning is very good - salty and citrusy at the same time.  \r\n\r\nFish & Chips - also really good - fried in a light batter, with moist fish inside, a great homemade Tartar Sauce and EXCELLENT coleslaw.\r\n\r\nDungeness Crab and Sweet White Corn Grit Porridge - tasty, but extremely rich.  Very buttery.\r\n\r\nStreet Corn - grilled, blackened corn-on-the-cob.  Very good.\r\n\r\nGrit Porridge with Scallions and Chili Oil - DELICIOUS.  I love grits to death, and this is one of the very best preparations I have ever had.  So smooth and creamy, with the bite of chili oil - a perfect food.  The waitress told us that she has a customer who comes in once a week and regularly orders 2 portions of this dish - one to eat right then, and one to take home.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-07", "description": "Sigh. Another place that makes me feel like \"I don't get it.\" A feature in 7x7 several months ago, 2 Yelp ROTDs, and many more glowing Yelper reviews led me to believe that the Front Porch had reinvented fried chicken the way that XXX reinvented XXX (you can probably come up with something wittier than I can). Admittedly, the chicken wasn't BAD. The meat did have quite a punchy tang to it, though a little too much in my opinion, thus detracting from the joy of eating the crispy cornmeal (albeit overseasoned) crust/skin. It was also d-r-y, which to me is b-a-d. Moreover, I am a dark meat kind of gal and was very upset to find nary a succulent thigh in the paper bucket. $30 freakin' dollars for fried chicken and you can't give me any juicy thigh-action?!?! Eating fried chicken has never made me so sad!\n\nThe rest of the meal echoed my ambivalent sentiments of the chicken. \n- Cornbread served w/ honey chili butter: the cute ear of corn shape tricks you into liking these more than is warranted. A bit dry, but one of my friends liked them enough to get a second order - which we were not informed was an extra charge. :-/\n\n- Conch-Habanero fritters: I had to convince my gastronomically-conservative friends to try these out by telling them that \"it tastes like shrimp.\" Truth is that I totally forgot what they tasted like. If they taste like shrimp, I couldn't really tell because the spices that they use overpower any conch flavor. They were a little chewy, which suggests being overdone. Accompanying aoli was pretty good though and cut into the too-intense flavor of the breading.\n\n- Jerk entree of the day was steak tips: isn't it customary to ask for how well you want steak done?  Well, we weren't asked. Luckily it came out medium done, which was acceptable to me. The potato salad served with the dish did not seem to match up with the steak in flavor or texture; too bland and undercooked potatoes.\n\n- Sides: \n1) Fries Three Ways (home, sweet, and french): the concept induces more excitement than actually eating them. Though it was kind of fun to try and guess which was the sweet. Maybe we got a bad batch - oily and limp. Sad fries! Must say that their homemade ketchup and mayo that comes with the fries were excellent.\n2) Sauteed greens: first off, we thought we had ordered the black-eyed peas with collard greens, not the sauteed mustard greens. Oh well, we ate them anyway. Bitter, as expected, and nothing special about the flavor.\n3) Coconut red beans and rice: yum. Definitely a departure from traditional red beans and rice, lighter even with the use of coconut milk. This saved my tongue from falling off when I made the mistake of using the habanero (I think, it was yellow) hot-sauce on my chicken...holy crap, I almost asked for a glass of milk. Be warned!\n\n- Libations: an  interesting, extensive drink menu. Happy that there was $3.50 Pacifico. And get this...they serve malt liquor. Some Yelpers will appreciate this more than I can.\n\nIt might sound like I didn't enjoy my meal, but that's not really the case. Perhaps that is the danger in doing too much research before eating somewhere...there is a much greater chance of disappointment. Foodwise, yeah it was a'ight. Quite a pricy meal for what I considered 3 star tastiness. In my opinion, what makes the Front Porch a destination location is more for the atmosphere of refined Southern comfort. From the wooden porch and rocking chairs out front to the comfortable booths to the gorgeous tin roof to the charming, ethereal waitstaff, I felt like I was in another city - one smaller, homier, friendlier than San Francisco. In the future, I would welcome a trip back to see if the food can match up with Front Porch's aesthetic.", "author": "Steph P."}

We took Muni from my house to the Mission, getting off a little early to walk through the Twilight Zone of Noe/Bernal/Outer Mission, walking past El Rio, Mi Lindo Peru, Good Frikkin Chicken, 26 Mix and all of my former Mission haunts, getting lost, asking for directions from a really nice man off the street and finally entering the cutest little cajun restaurant this side of the Mississippi.\n\nThe Front Porch is small, quirky, intimate and fun. We seated ourselves at the counter as there was already a small wait at 6:30pm on a Friday night, with a bartender that I've seen somewhere else (and still haven't figured out where), a mariachi player playing Spanish love songs (swoon) and a hodge-podge of old Southern knick-knacks and heirlooms that would make any granny-belle jealous.\n\nThe menu displayed all the variations of comfort only a traditional belle in the kitchen could create. Fried chicken, ribs, grits, collard greens, corn, shrimp, stews, black eyed peas, etc. \n\nWe started with some crab and corn grits. I think we almost licked the plate clean. Cornbread and pepper butter accompanied our starter; it was buttery and light and perfectly matched with the spicy butter.\n\nActually, everything we ordered had a little bit of kick to it. Our bucket of fried chicken came with a side of stewed black eyed peas, collard greens and pork belly, and another side of grits (this time with a smoked pepper butter). The fried chicken was the killer dish, though, with a cracker/cornmeal crust and an herbed brine, and fried to light/crispy perfection. It arrived in a popcorn bucket with bits of popped corn adorning the chicken and plate.\n\nI wanted to stuff my face silly, but had enough self control to save some room for dessert. Blue cheese drenched in brandied cherry honey and served with little toasts.\n\nThe bartender was gracious and provided excellent suggestions.

Shayna, the bartender, was completely (or voluntarily) unaware of our existence.  We ordered two courses, and when the first course arrived, we were hesitant in asking for napkins, silverware and plates, since Shayna was busy talking to another guest about her new crush.  When our entrees arrived, the host who delivered the food was gracious enough to get us plates and whatever else we needed.\n\nNot once during the course of service, did Shayna check back on us.  In fact, we asked for the bread that was supposed to accompany our meal and our food questions were met with, not answers, but puzzled looks and exasperated sighs.  AWESOME.  \n\nBasically, Shayna shouldn't be working in the service industry.  We gave her 20%, simply because we work in the industry, and our consciences would not allow us to do otherwise.  However, Shayna's service was worth about a 4% tip, if that.  Sorry if we ruined your night, by wanting to pay for food and service, Shayna.  Here's a suggestion, get another job that doesn't involve making people happy.", "author": "Camille C."}

This applies to pizza, where Little Star is our backup.  Emmy's Spaghetti Shack was our Plan B to this place.\n\nI have been here once before, and the first time, while I don't remember what I had, I DO remember it was good.  I don't know what happened between now and then.  You all know about the dark interior, and how loud it gets, so we'll skip all that.\n\nThe corn bread starter was very good, with chili butter.  My friend does not like spicy food much, and I wanted her share of the \"red stuff\", but she selfishly didn't give me any!  No matter ... it was still good.  And possibly the second best part of the meal?\n\nI was intrigued by the Grilled Hearts of Romaine Salad.  We had the bacon on the side.  The dressing was an interesting combination of Avocado and Habanero.  I guess I was expecting more heat.  The lettuce was more than grilled ... it was burnt and resembled burnt paper on some parts.  I don't know if it actually TASTED like burnt paper, but it clearly resembled that.  We should have stuck with the \"Doubles\" of Chickpea and Butternut Squash.  \n\nMy friend had the Vegan Stew, and she says it resembled regular vegetables simmered in ketchup.  She did not find it appetizing at all, and only mustered a few bites.  For me, it was a toss up between the fried chicken, and the Bajan Bavette.  I should have chosen the former, but didn't since they have that every day.  The hanger steak, which is reported to be one of the most flavorful steak, lacked said flavor.  The thyme crust ruled that out.  The accompanying Onion Strings were a bit cold, and I never got to try the Broccoli Rabe before we decided to head out.  We did order the Corn on the cob, and it was tasty, and makes me want to grill my own ... if only I can FIND yellow corn!\n\nThe service is good, and the waiter recommended a good bottle of red wine to compliment both my friends vegetables and my steak.  We had the Sere Grenache, which was very nice ...\n\nLike I said ... it's good to have a Plan B.", "author": "Michael M."}

First, the beers on tap are great!  I had the Gator and my friend had the Big Daddy.  For dinner we ordered the fried okra, plantains, spicy shrimp and grits.  For dinner, it of course was the fried chicken and a side of mac-n-cheese.\nHere are my ratings:\n\nFried okra: ehh...3 stars (not bad, not great)\n\nPlantains: 3 stars (little dry, nice portions)\n\nSpiy shrimp and grits: 4.5 stars (this was the best dish of the night)\n\nFried chicken: 3.5 stars (too much coating, a little over cooked but at least the insides were moist.  I still prefer Roscoes, or Glady's Knights in Atlanta, and I have to admit even the fried chicken at Whole Foods Market)\n\nMac-n-cheese: 4 stars (hot, bubbly, maybe two different cheeses)\n\nOur server was Amy and she was great.  For dessert we had the Chocolate Pecan Chess Pie with a scoop of Mitchells Ice Cream and of course that was divine!\n\nAtmosphere was cozy and very neighborly.

Pretty random.\n\nWe did make reservations,  their timing on it was only off by a few minutes, and we got sat in a booth built for 7.  It might have been the only larger booth in the place, and no more people would have possibly fit.  We sat there chatting it up for a bit, but it took us a good 10 minutes to get menus.  My roommate had to ask the server for them.  This was one of the few hiccups that occurred during our evening.  I say they were merely hiccups because i had a really great time, and truly enjoyed the food, and would definitely come back here to eat again.\n\nThe corn shaped cornbread is great...my roommate and i shared a Bistro salad, the Seabass special of the day and the Pork chop.  Everyone at the table was happy with their meals, and i tried many of the other dishes, including the side of brussel sprouts which were outstanding.\n\nSo the Pork Chop arrives , and two of us have ordered it at the table.  We both look at the chop, see its served with french fries and the other sides that were listed to be served with the Rib-eye.  It looks a little dark for pork, but we cut into it and its quite delicious, but tastes an awful lot like steak as well....but its pink in the middle and that's how she said the pork was served.  Now i don't know why i was doubting my meat knowledge.  The other girl who ordered it said she hadn't had pork in 10 years, but the fact that it took me two bites, and me doubting myself enough to finally call the waitress over and tell her that we received the rib-eye and not the pork chop, disappoints me greatly.  A GIRL SHOULD KNOW HER MEAT!!  After an apology and the right meal being served, we were all happy.  \n\nThey were very nice about the whole thing, and for me that's important.  The way i looked at it after i left, was \"man that pork was good, and maybe next time ill order the rib-eye because that was tasty too!\"  Had they been assholes, it would have been another story.\n\nOne of the best parts of this place, aside from their signature fried chicken (another member of our party had that), is that they have a very random, fun wine list.  We got our wine in a jug, and you could have also ordered wine that comes in a juice box.  Something different to make for an enjoyable meal worth talking about.\n\nThe ambiance in this place is also great...dimly lit for a date evening, with tin ceilings, dark furniture and a newer hip, urban feel.  For music I think that they just play their ipod at a reasonable volume, which is OK by me because last night we were listening to Beck and Radiohead, two of my personal favorites.", "author": "Lauren F."}

Not in the \"I'm going to KFC for lunch\" way but when the craving hits, there's no stopping me.  So when I heard about The Front Porch I just had to give it a try.  The food was pretty good-the chicken had a lot of flavor to the batter and was hot and crispy.  If you go with a large party definitely split a bucket-9 pieces w/ 2 sides for $29 compared to 2 pieces w/1 side for $11 if you order individually.  \n\nService was kind of scattered-our waitress was really friendly but mentioned to us a couple of times how slammed she was which I thought was weird.  We asked how many pieces came with the side of corn and were told 2.  Four of us wanted corn so we asked for 2 orders of it...when the waitress brought out the food she said she was mistaken and it was only 1 piece per order and only brought us 2 pieces.  We went ahead and ordered 2 more pieces (because splitting corn on the cob just ain't happening) but it would have been a nice gesture on her part if she had just realized her mistake and brought out the extra 2 pieces initially.  \n\nAlso, at this point they are only taking reservations for parties of 5 or greater...since we had 5 people we were able to get a reservation but were seated at a table for 4 with a chair stuck on the end.  Not very comfy for 5 adults.\n\nAll told it was a fun night out-good food, decent prices, cool space (The Front Porch even has a cute little front porch)  I'll probably be back but I'll give them some time to work the kinks out first.", "author": "phil h."}

The Front Porch with their cornmeal crusted, juicy, and full of flavor down to the bone chicken takes top spot in my book.  The great thing about this restaurant is the affordability factor.  It is good eating for a lot less than I expected.  \n\nTheir appetizers range from $5-10.  Highlights were the fried chicken livers served on top of gravy toast with sauteed onions and the Bistro Salad that could have used at least 2 more oysters.  Avoid the ceviche unless you like tangy and sour because the salmon pieces are placed in a cup of this sour concoction.  You almost have to bob for the fish pieces with your fork.  \n\nSides were also hit or miss.  We enjoyed the black eye peas with collagreens.  We didn't like the fries because they are the thick kind and the coleslaw which followed the too sour theme.  \n\nIf you order the right items, this place is well deserving of the 4 stars.  Be prepared for a wait because it can get crowded.  For the alcoholics, they only have a beer and wine license!", "author": "Jason A."}

Followed by the crabmeat and sweet corn grit entree - let me just say that I have yet to experience the orgasm-by-food, but this came awfully close.  Fiends at the table had the black eyed peas (good) and the fried chicken (succulent and fabulous).  We all left fat, happy and very full.\r\n\r\nI must call out that they lost our reservation (get on Opentable, dammit!) and we ended up seated at a booth for four with a chair on the end, which was quite awkward.

Came here on a friday night and we were told it was going to be a forty minute wait, so we decided to get a drink at the bar. The sangria was amazingly tasty made with guava puree, rose wine and a splash of bubbles. So refreshing. Luckily what was going to be a forty minute wait ended up being just fifteen minutes. Bonus!\nWe started off with the gumbo. The chicken and sausage were tender and tasty, not overly cooked and just the right amount! The fried okra just made the dish perfect. For the main course we ordered the fried chicken which came with mashed taters and collard greens. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because you can't sub out the boring collard greens for extra taters or at least something with taste and not so BLAH. We also got a side of brussel sprouts which was cooked to perfection. Capers, lemon and butta, need I say more??", "author": "Kehaulani K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-08-16", "description": "Update: We've gone twice more since the initial review -- not as fantastic but the place is still super busy and the staff is still nice. The vegan okra entree I had on our second visit was just not a good balance with tomatoes and plantains -- felt like it was just sides thrown together with no forethought. And no tasty seasoning salt in sight!  Second visit was better, although I wish server had noted that my combination of bean-ish soup with bean-ish side of black-eyed peas might be a little too, well, bean-ish as a meal (vegan entree was AGAIN okra, so I passed...). Please look into some additional veggie entrees to offer your loyal leftie customers! We want to love you Front Porch!  PS If you've read this far, here's a tip -- tell the host you'll go wait for a table at the 3300, then head down 29th for a drink. \r\n\r\nOK, so this is my first Yelp review and here I thought, since this place opened yesterday, I might be the first or even second reviewer -- no dice -- this site is crazy hip, apparently!  Or just really popular with my little corner of the Mission, since I also live about 30 yards away from The Front Porch.  My boyfriend and I have eagerly awaited its opening since moving here in May, and we were not disappointed with our opening night dinner.  \r\n\r\nThe atmosphere, staff, food -- the whole shebang, basically -- were all great. Walked in and, since we got there early (learned our lesson from sister hangout Emmy's, which we also adore), got seated right away at a table in back -- my spot was an old bench seat from a car, seatbelt still attached.  Dolly was crooning something when we arrived, and later we caught snippets of Robert Johnson-ish blues.  I think the music picked up the tempo a bit later in the evening. Patterned tin (?) ceiling and checkered linoleum floor were homey, and the bare walls seemed to be waiting for art. I picked up the receiver to a pay phone near our table to check for a dial tone and nope -- pay phones are now just a decorative retro-prop, a fact that makes me feel about 100 years old!\r\n\r\nThe food is unique and very tasty, and they had a solid beer and wine list and soft drinks included my favorite, ginger beer.  We opted for a jug of \"Tres - something\" red wine -- these jugs, once cleaned, seem to double for the water bottles, too. I love it that this place and Emmy's both leave water on your table -- how simple!  How wonderful when scarfing up garlicy and/or spicy fare not to have to desperately flag down a harried server every five minutes!  Why don't more places do this? Sorry, I digress...\r\n\r\nAnyway, my honey had the pickled veggies with egg as an app and I had the green salad with sugary mustardy vinaigrette.  I sampled his veggies -- fresh, crunchy, delicious pickling -- don't think of a nasty old egg in a jar at Moe's bar for this fare, please!  Veggies included beets and green and wax beans -- wax beans!  Suddenly I'm five and getting a no-thank-you helping from my mom, only this time it's \"more please!\"\r\nI don't do eggs but honey said it was fab.  \r\n\r\nThe veggies also came with a cute, teeny bowl of homemade seasoning salt that I promptly confiscated for my beautiful, fresh, but a little bit bland green salad -- this salt is to die for, seriously.  The hot sauce and catsup on the tables are homemade, too, we were told, and the hot sauce was H*O*T.  As noted by others, the cornbread was wonderful, crumbly but moist with a slightly crisp exterior -- and cutely shaped like baby corn, I can picture the cast-iron mold! I ate mine plain with some of that crackalicous seasoning salt while my honey enjoyed with butter.\r\n\r\nFor entrees we had the vegan squash and rice (me) and crab and grits something (him) -- both filling and delish.  I was thrilled to have a unique and labeled vegan entree to select and I hope there are more to come whenever the menu has seasonal changes.  There were two or three more things on the menu that looked to be vegan and I can't wait to try those on our next visit, which will be soon!\r\n\r\nThere were few cons and one would be understandable slowness on opening night, the salad being a wee bit bland, and once the place started jumping it was somewhat loud.  Quarters are tight between tables, at least in the back, and part of the noise was also the appealing open view to the kitchen. So, this definitely is just more of a heads-up if you're looking for a quiet, romantic evening -- get here early or just have a drink at the bar and enjoy the front porch -- yes, there really is one!", "author": "Karen W."}

We were quickly informed that there were specials, but no. We were on a mission. \"How much isi n the bucket?\" \"Oh, about 10 pieces\" \"Fantastic, that's what we'll have.\" \n\nI started out with a beet salad, which was good quite delicious, especially the fried onion bits. The greens were a bit stemmy, but as a gestalt, it was quite good. My \"dining companions\" had a Waldorf salad, which completely disappeared, so it must have been at least decent!\n\nNext came the main course. Chicken, macaroni pie, and french fries. Wow, this stuff was remarkably freaking awesome. The chicken was moist, with crispy skin and with a wonderfully flavorful batter. The mac and cheese pie was rich and delicious. The fries were a mix of sweet and russet potatoes, along with a spicy dipping ketchup. Yum.\n\nAnd then dessert. I had the pets de nonne, which I now see translates as Nun Farts.

They should have added a sharper cheese for contrast or at least something to give it some punch.

Fried chicken, grits, shrimp gumbo, and all that Southernjazz!\n\n\nI came here on a Monday night with my boyfriend and it was empty. I didn't feel that the reservations were needed, but whatevs. The restaurant was dark and casual. I can tell it was a place for hipsters from looking at our waitress and waiters. \n\nBooze: Thunderberg and a Champagne Cocktail\n\nBite:  \n1. Corn bread -- complimentary starter\n2. Chicken gumbo - Mm-mmmmmm. . I love a whole big pot o' gumbo served hot and bubbly. Gumbos usually overload with okra, giving the soup a very gooey texture, but this was perfect with a  blend of andouille sausages and rice. It had a bit of a smokey taste, but I loved it overall.\n3. Shrimp & grits - This was the best part of my meal, as usual. I don't know how and when I got so obsessed with grits, but it has become my alternative to rice! The consistancy was great -- creamy and tasteful.\n4. Mac & Cheese - My first impression was that their mac&cheese was really different than what I had. It wasn't an orange cheese they used, but rather a white cheese with a cream-cheese (sour) taste to it. I personally loved it and thought it was delicious and something new, but the boyfriend took a few bites and left it all for fatty me. :( \n5. Fried chicken - We came here specifically for this and it is probably the one thing I can do without next time eating at Front Porch. I can't seem to say I loved this bucket of fried chicken. It could be that by the time we got our order, the mashed potatoes, greens, and entire bucket was overwhelming to our full, round bellies. The battered could have been crispier and it tasted a bit burnt. *Shrug \n\n\n\n$97 later, our bellies were satisfied,  but the wallet wasn't.", "author": "Rosanne L."}

However, my reality was just a tad different. My front porch consisted of a few tables and chairs. I had the San Francisco fog seeping into my \"not so tanned anymore\" skin. I had a delicious piece of fried chicken on one hand and my other hand was waving to cars speeding down 29th Ave (between San Jose and Tiffany). \n\nThis Front Porch may not be the front porch complete with the wooden swing and rocking chair you envision, but I bet you the fried chicken they serve here would be exactly what they serve in the south. I came here on a Tuesday and the place was packed - I repeat...PACKED...on a TUESDAY! The fried chicken is awesome - perfectly crisp on the outside, moist and juicy on the inside. My friends and I ordered a bucket of fried chicken which came in a popcorn container complete with the popcorn. I ended up ordering the burger. Yes, you have read right...I ordered a burger...at a soul food restaurant. I was craving a nice juicy piece of ground up cow that day...okay? The burger was delicious--quite possibly amongst one of the best I've tasted.

I actually went back twice to see if they could get me in, and it was worth the wait. The decor was very kitschy but in a good way. The bar was almost a communal table for those who weren't fortunate enough to get a table. I  looked around to see what most people were eating, and the fried chicken seemed quite popular, and quirky as it was served in a tub of popcorn with popcorn bits thrown in. Hmm perhaps it was popcorn chicken, very clever ;) Unfortunately, for us herbivores, there was one vegetarian dinner option sadly, and even that was a toss up. It was a  wild card \"seasonal choice of vegetables.\" Very vague, but apparently it was a vegetarian taco meal for like $17. I dunno about you, but I don't go to southern food restaurants for the tacos. So what we did instead, my dinner guest and I shared sides tapas style and it worked pretty well, considering we were both vegetarians. Word of warning make sure you say Vegetarian, because they can make a vegetarian roumelade, and their gravy is meat based for mashed potatoes. So we ordered fried okra, a black eyed pea salad, fried greed tomatoes, mash potatoes sans gravy, and mac and cheese. Their little complementary cornbread was a cruel tease, and I don't believe on the menu, only biscuits at a whopping $4 each. \nFor dessert we had the beignets and the peach cobbler, which both left much to be desired. I have been to new orleans du monde cafe and so far only the louisiana food on shattuck in berkeley could compare. The beignets were heavy and dry. The peach cobbler was a bit bland, but I could tell they used fresh peaches.\nThis is definitely something to indulge in every blue moon, with all the fried decadent foods, but they were good, and since they were mostly sides, we got them delivered faster than we could finish them, which was very nice.\nThe service was nothing remarkable. The waitress, a southern belle with a british accent lol, didn't write our order down, and naturally we had to send back some of the sauces on our vegetable entrees, which they acted like they did us a favor. I also got the impression that some of the staff were stoned on the job: i.e. the waiter who asked my friend for the game status, as he assumed that if he was looking at his iphone he was following the game. The maitre d' who seemed distant/spacey when asking if there were any available seats. I had the impression that she didn't quite understand the question. Anyhow, she eventually got us in so no harm no foul.\nI will be going back... there is a grilled corn on the cob with my name on it.", "author": "Onika C."}

Enter: The Front Porch\n\nNice atmosphere that's just homey enough with out being over kitschy, and the rocking chairs out front are a nice touch.\n\nDrink selection has some hard to find Louisiana imports which is nice.\n\nThe food however, was not over the top stellar.  Well presented, yes, but authentic, no.  It feels very \"Cajun inspired\" while at the same time not being innovative.  No offense New Yorkers, but it feels like one of you designed this menu after browsing cheap cook books at Amazon.  I'm being harsh here, but I'm protective of my Creole.  \n\nHere's the laundry list:\n\nFried Okra : GOOD!  (this was done well, nothing fancy just good food)\nRedbeans and rice: Ug.  THis was just red beans over rice.  No real spice or long cooking it seemed.  Edible, but not that great.\nGumbo: This. is. not. gumbo.  Tastes ok, but not gumbo.\n\nI sampled some other dishes.  Very tasty porkchop.  Black eyed peas were ok.  Etc.\n\nOne thing I have to point out : The staff was awesome! Very friendly and helpful (despite not knowing what File Gumbo was.)  They are the reason this gets an extra star and I will likely be back at some point.\n\nIn summary: The Front Porch is not bad food, it just isn't food that knows what it is yet.

The restaurant is the downstairs of someone's house, it's unbelievable, great idea! Service is amazing. Here are the things we ordered: 1. Salmon Tartar with fried salmon neck bone & fried mushrooms. This was just \"eh\" for me. The fried fish & mushrooms lacked flavor. The tartar was okay but also lacked flavor. Won't order that again. 2. Crab Fritters. Super yummy!!! Definitely will have again! 3. Corndog. It's not a hot dog but rather andouille sausage filled with bacon. I liked it. It's pretty huge & comes with AMAZING homemade tater tots. 4. Bucket of Fried Chicken. I've had better tasting fried chicken but this one was not bad at all. The batter was good & the chicken was juicy, not dry. Pretty standard. Cool part was that they serve it in a cardboard popcorn bucket, like the ones you get at the movie theater, plus they sprinkle a bit of popcorn on top, very cute! 5. Vegetarian Jambalaya. Very yummy!!! Would order again. Lots of tomato in it, but I like tomatoes. Some veggies, but mostly rice 6. Baked Mac & Cheese. All I can say is WOW. I've never had Mac & Cheese this amazing. This was definitely the highlight of my meal. If & when I go back, I think I'll order 10 of these!! 7. Mashed Potatoes. They perfectly flavored, smooth & silky, went well with the chicken. 8. Homemade Biscuits. Pretty standard, nothing that stood out much about them, but also not bad. Oh, and I can't forget the delicious cornbread sticks they served while we waited for our food. They were warm, buttery, and perfect.

Things were great until the food arrived (after an eternity). I don't understand how there are raves about the fried chicken. It was completely bland. Yes the meat was succulent, but the breading was a complete snore. Same goes for the catfish. Both just not good.  I have never had chewy hush puppies before and they were inedible.  Were they stale?  \n\nAn odd silence fell over our table as we sort of begrudgingly picked through our food, rather than an excited, mouths-full, tucking-in.  The rhubard tart was not prepared properly and although it had a nice flavor, was simply a mushy mess, even the crust.

They did, after all, take over one of two Latin Fight Club Bars on that street, and in doing so dramatically reduced the number of drunken street fights in my neighborhood.  I'd heard good things from my roommate, and the menu looked not half bad, so I took it for a spin last weekend.\n\nAnd, well, ew.\n\nThe interior of this place is dark.  Not just pleasant ambient dark, the kind where the flicker of candlelight makes everyone look better... no, this was just plain dark.  No matter.  I've seen my friend enough to recognize his silhouette, so I wasn't worried about suddenly dining with a stranger.  But it's not just dark, it's dark and... green.  So the dark plus the green lends the whole place a somewhat cavelike atmosphere.  It also makes people look a bit sickly.  The noise level went from pleasant to \"HUH WHAT I CAN'T HEAR YOU!\" as the restaurant filled up, so conversation over dinner was right out.\n\nThe host was quick to seat us and quick to ask for our names.  Friendly sort.  Our waiter was anything but.  He seemed bored and disintenterested, at least until he got to his next table.  There he chatted up the four diners for (we timed it) nearly 20 minutes.  Meanwhile, we have no drinks.  We pointed this out to our waiter when he disengaged himself from the foursome seated next to us and were met with a snapped \"they're on their way.\"  \n\nAmbience aside, the food was neither great nor awful.  The friend's appetizer arrived after our meal, after yet another reminder to our waiter.  Our orders of fried chicken arrived, all flaky weird cornmeal crust and slimy fatty skin.  The meat under this coating was indeed succulent with a lovely limey tang, though.  Kudos on their marinating.  If they could fix the outer coating, the chicken would be a winner.  A smoky soupy bowl of collards and black eyed peas went uneaten, as it was just too soupy and too smoky to be tasty.  But hey, we got moist towelettes, so we were good.  \n\nOur check was delivered promptly; unfortunately, our waiter disappeared just as promptly.

Great sweet and sour brussels sprouts, too, which our nice waiter gave us for free because he initially forgot to put in the order.\n\nThe saloon ambiance was spot-on, and only enhanced by the entry of a traveling mariachi band that briefly interrupted the solid soundtrack of Joy Division. They did a weird rendition of the birthday song for the two large birthday parties hogging half of the restaurant. This would be a fun place for a birthday party, so maybe I'm just jealous. \n\nMy only complaint, other than the lack of more vegetarian dishes (just one more would make me happy!) is that when there's a long wait and it's freezing and rainy outside, the leaky literal front porch isn't such a good waiting room.", "author": "Rachel J."}

The only dish we really didn't favor was a vegan special of the evening, a veggie stew in a weak sauce made no stronger by the glass of pinot noir accidentally spilled in the mix.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-09-18", "description": "We hadn't been out to dinner with some good friends in far too long.  We wanted to try something fun and new for all of us.  Hmmm...  Where should we go?  Hey!  How about a new restaurant where we knew the chef's abilities and style?  Shall we say... Front Porch?!?  \r\n\r\nWe ventured toward Front Porch with great anticipation to see what great dishes were to be had.  We put in our name and sat on the porch on rocking chairs.  A nice way to relax on a warm evening before dinner with friends.  We were called about 15 minutes before our quoted wait time --- things were looking up.  We entered the dimly lit room that had pressed tin ceilings and cool blue walls, and a aged but very stylish bar.  We were seated under a speaker, the music thumping with excitement.  Music ala Emmy's.  \r\n\r\nThere were great combinations on the menu that we thought would work well together.  We yelled our orders through the din of the bass beat repeatedly to our server who was very personable, humorous and patient.  After straightening out our entree order, it wasn't long before our meals arrived.  Now... about the food.  Well, let's just say that I will have to give it another try.  Mostly, we opted for dishes that other friends and acquaintances hadn't already tried and liked.  For our entrees, we tried the vegan porridge, fish and chips, and fried chicken with a side dish of black eyed peas and collard greens.  \r\n\r\nFirst the porridge, great as an entree?  No.  As an appetizer, yes, due to the size of the portions.  About 8 inches across and a half  inch deep --- think smallish pancake size.  All yours for $9.50.  Yikes!  Two portions were served so there didn't seem to be a mistake on the portioning.  We felt obligated to share our remaining food with our friends!  \r\n\r\nNext, fish and chips.  The fish was good.  Crisp, flaky, moist fish with just the right crunch with the cornmeal coating.  Yum for me.  The chips were a little flat and cool, perhaps cooked too soon before serving and maybe from different batches since there were two different styles (cubed home fry and French fry cuts).  The coleslaw was just interesting.  Great if you like caraway flavor.  Nice light dressing but the cabbage seemed to be cut a little too thick, making it rather chewy.  Not for most at our table, but I could see that others would like it.  \r\n\r\nLastly, the much talked about fried chicken.  Overall, I have to agree with the minority of customers who didn't like it.  My first piece was deep fried heaven.  A perfectly fried thigh with the just the right amount of spices and crunch.  The two remaining breast pieces were plain and simply, over done.  It was difficult to eat the other pieces without the help of the busser would kept us well supplied with water in vintage wine jugs.  The collard greens and black eyed peas were very good.  I thought these were very tasty (with just a hint of coconut milk?).  Yum!\r\n\r\nAfter a ho-hum meal, we thought we would brighten our spirits with the chocolate cake and the apple crisp.  We were able to try one of the two apple crisps we orderd because they ran short.  It appeared the portion was good, but the apple crisp was described as being basically chunky apple sauce without the crisp.  The chocolate cake was just okay as well.  Nothing special, just chocolate cake and a dollop of fresh whipped cream.  Each serving was small that the size of what you could make in an Easy-Bake-Oven.  The frosting was just a tad bit salty.  With no alcohol ordered, we were slapped with an $80 bill, (with tip, it wasn't the server's fault!).  We left a little deaf and somewhat hungry.  A sad ending to a place with potential.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I will likely revisit Front Porch in a few months to see what other inspiring combinations they are offering.  To be sure, they have the talent and the taste buds.  Just not on the evening we visited.  Check them out for their other dishes!", "author": "Joe B."}

I really thought it would be a down-home soul food - well - diner. When I stepped over the threshold on that crisp Friday night (crisp is really my poetic euphemism for freezing frickin' cold) I found it to be a cozy, romantic, hip haute-soul restaurant.\n\nAnd the sounds coming from our table once our Miss Ollie's Fried Chicken hit our table were triple-x pornographic. The moaning and lip-smacking sounds emanating from our table would have made Jenna Jamison blush. Okay. Maybe not Jenna. But Linda Lovelace, definitely. When she was still alive. And not a prude. Did you see that documentary on Deep Throat?! She really took a turn.\n\nBut my point is that I am forever ruined on fried chicken because never again will any breaded and fried poultry pass my lips that comes anywhere near as good as that crack (and really, that's a damn shame, because we all need more breaded and fried poultry in our lives). And the macaroni and cheese pie? I was dying!\n\nThe server was really cool and attentive. But I must say, because the staff doesn't wear clothing of any uniformity whatsoever, as he first approached my table I was wondering why this guy was heading in my direction. But when he came back with a pint glass of Jasper Poppy beer from Morgan Hill, well, he had me at \"Here's your...\". That was one fine beer.\n\nThe review that brought me here said that the Front Porch has really affordable soul food. Well, she apparently eats at much more expensive restaurants than I - that and I acknowledge I am a total cheapskate. Our meal for two (including two Jasper Poppy's - shut up. Not each!) Was nearly fifty bucks. When I think \"affordable soul food\" I'm really thinking more in the 25 dollar range. But I guarantee you, and the trendster staff, that this will not be an \"occasion restaurant\" for me. The magnetic pull of that fried chicken is too strong. Much too strong.\n\nDamn.

On the menu it is described as their daily selection of \"offal, off-cuts, and other things we love.\" The day I went was off-the-bone pig's feet.  Now I usually reserve pig's feet for cheapo Chinese restaurants, but since this was a southern-themed quasi-try-too-hard place, I thought they might put some nice southern touches on it.  WRONG.  The only touch, which was acceptable but not to the level of \"nice,\" was lima beans.  The rest was not acceptable.  Pig's feet is supposed to be a mixture of fat, meat, and cartilage.  The stuff they used contanied none of the latter two.  Then they just threw that with the beans and tomatoes on a bed of instant rice.  No sort of flavoring whatsoever.  Now I don't expect pig feet at a southern restaurant to be stellar or anything, but it was like they just threw everything into a plate and didn't even try.  No words that I use can even do homage to that horribleness.  Let's face it, this dish was awful.\n\nEven worse, they charged $16.50 for it, which was on the *slightly* higher side of average.  But pig's feet are cheap as hell.  You can get them for $0.99-$1.99/lb @ Manila World Market just down Mission (which is probably where they got them from.)  They are obviously way cheaper than entire pieces of chicken that are fried, of which someone from our party ordered for $15.95.  But considering how horrible it was, it should have been cheaper, WAY cheaper, probably even cheaper than the Vegan Shepherd's Pie.\n\nSome of my acquaintances had better luck.  The house-smoked salmon appetizer was way too salty, but a nice attempt & at least edible.  The crab salad wasn't bad.  The brisket was pretty good.  The dungeness crab & cheese grits was perfect (and the feet were so bad that it took this spoonful of perfection, combined with a spoon or fork everything else passable, to pull this up to even two stars.)\n\nEven though I don't take service into consideration in my ratings (unless it's extraordinarily bad or good), for those who care, they were very nice and casual-professional but we had to wait a loooooooong time, even before they came to take our order.", "author": "David A."}

No corn bread, none of those spicy chips.  Forget the drinks...the sangria was just OK (I've had better).  Hold the side dishes - no potato salad (it was alright, I was just a little thrown off because I was expecting that kind of mayonaise-y, fast food-type potato salad), no collard greens or black-eyed peas, no coconut red beans & rice (which were actually pretty tasty).\n  \nNo, instead of all that, just park that big bucket of chicken in front of me and I'll be happy.  Very happy.  Really, I think that's all I will need.  That meaty, tasty fried chicken with the flavorful, flakey skin.  Yum.  There's an old Run-DMC lyric that always runs through my head when I eat chicken: \"Yo, yo, is this Kentucky Fried?\".  No, Run.  This is most definitely NOT Kentucky Fried!

So when I found out that we were eating out there my mind was made up; I barely even looked at the menu. \n\nAnd looking back, I can't say I was completely disappointed; The chicken was moist and tender, even the breast meat. The dry crumbly batter on it was unique and kind of tasty, and I enjoyed the creamed collards and grits (no mashed potatoes that night.) I have to give them some credit for putting their own spin on a traditional dish, but my expectations were set really high and it didn't quite meet the mark. I think I prefer the orthodox fried chicken that I get at places like powells. \n\nAK, a front porch veteran, knew better. She ordered what turned out to be one of the best burgers I've ever been able to eat off of someone else's plate; Uruguayan beef, bacon and cheddar with perfectly done fries and some tangy, slightly spicy homemade ketchup. If you ran a restaurant would it even occur to you to make your own ketchup? Small details can go a long way. \n\nWhich is what is bothering me. Has all the talk about the fried chicken there been some kind of misdirection? Have you all been steering the suckers towards the chicken so they don't run out of hamburger or ingredients for some other fantastic dish that's only for those in the know? I wouldn't do something like that to any of you.\n\nOh, and the cornbread starter with the spicy butter was as good as any cornbread I've ever had. \n\nI usually start off reviews with the decor and service, but I'm all out of sorts now and my review is backwards. See what you've done? I hope you're happy.\n\nThere are tile floors like you'd find in your grandparents' basement and tin stamped ceilings like you'd find in a victorian mansion. There is no carpet, no tapestries, no fabric anywhere in the dining room. So the Front Porch is NOISY. I can't recommend the place for a first date unless conversation makes you uncomfortable. The tables are basic wood squares on legs, and some of the seats in the back have been salvaged from a passenger van, complete with seatbelts and fold down armrests.  \n\nThe hipster wait staff was friendly, but a little slow. AK said the service was worse than usual so I imagine it's generally very good. \n\nI'll definitely come back, but I'll have the burger or something else next time, and I'll recommend that everyone have the burger or something else good because I'm unselfish and I want my friends to enjoy their meal as much as I do when I find something special.

We actually wanted to sit on their rocking chairs that they had on their front porch. (: \n\nWhen we got there they asked if we had reservations, and we didn't. But we were able to get seated if we were going to be done by 7:15, so we said yes & took the seats! I guess its good to know that reservations really do help to get a seat at this place, and they don't give away your table so they guarantee you table.\n\nDown to the food, we weren't too hungry so we decided to only order 1 appetizer and 2 entrees for three girls. \n- Appetizer: FRIED PICKLES $6. I was extremely excited to try their fried pickles because I am a pickle lover and and fried pickle lover! But boy was it a disappointment! I don't know if it was the pickles that they used, or the batter they fried it in but it -was just not working. I would never get those again. \n- Entree #1: FRIED CHICKEN(SINGLE) $17. We got the single because it comes with 3 pieces and there were three of us! I believe the bucket ($33 1/3) comes with 8 pieces or something and that was going to be too much for us. This comes with three pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and collard greens. Oh my, the chicken was delicious! The skin was so crispy and the chicken meat was very moist.

Entering the building I had a really good vibe, and the bartender was extremely kind to us. That was the last person who treated me the way I expect to be treated at a place like this. \n\nThe wait staff was way too \"in your face\"; I felt hurried to place our order and constantly interrupted during the course of the meal. Music & noise levels were identical to a crowded bar, making it very difficult to conduct what I consider typical dinner conversation. \n\nAt least one order of each course (appetizer, entree, dessert, and beverages) took forever to arrive. They did provide a couple of randomly selected dishes to fill the interminable delays, but I would have preferred their waiving the charge for late food rather than having to politely pick at nectarines in sea salt. At one point I actually had to corral our waiter and utter the sentence, \"What's the status of those nuts?\" which was the turning point for our waiter from in-your-face-let's-get-it-over-with to obsequious and visiting too often. \n\nGuess I should have ordered the fried chicken!

We need to check it out.\" So we did--on a couple of occassions. \n\nFirst of all, the best thing about the place for me is the Bartenders: cute and friendly; they also pour a generous glass of wine--try the Sancerre it is the best on the menu. \n\nDuring the couple of times we have eaten there, I have tried the burger, ceviche, brussel sprouts, fried okra, chicken livers, fries, and bites of my girlfriend's fried chicken when she was not looking.

So far the dishes have been delicious, but I must say the fried okra did visit me later, but sure was good while I was chowing down on it. \n\nMy only gripe is not the wait--go have a beer at the 3300 Club; nor the noise--turn up your hearing aid; it is that the menu does not change that much so I cannot go there as often as I like.

Since Fussy is a gay, I agreed to accompany him so he wouldn't get caught muttering to himself in a corner like a crazy person. If you ever see a guy in the back of a BART train, whispering to him self in a low voice the amount of people that get off at the Montgomery station, don't be alarmed, it's just my Fussy amusing himself. \n\nAnyway, so many of these kinds of events have several food stations that provide 4\" plates and bites of this and bites of that; this is okay if you have already eaten. But at the dinner hour I hate this method of feeding the masses. This event had tid-bits of this cube of ham and a little squirty spread on that piece of tiny bread, tiny salads in plastic martini glasses and an array of miscellaneous food wadded up in small ball shapes.  The worst part about eating at many events is that they make you eat while standing up, I hate this too. The plus, plus, plus thing about this particular event was that they hosted a fully stocked and open bar, and it was big with minimal wait times.  This made up for the three giant bowls of potato chips with coordinating dips.\n\nAfter twirling it up on the dance floor to the live music of a singing tranny in sequins and confirming we lost the raffle prizes and silent auction items we bid on, it was time to go. We threw our wine and vodka lined tummies into a cab and made our way to The Front Porch. \n\nThe instant we walked into the restaurant we were greeted by the bartender, and we were seated by a very nice hostess within minutes. I was so much in the mood for a quirky, quaint neighborhood restaurant like this and I immediately felt good about my surroundings. It was dark and moody, and the people looked like they were all having a great time. Eclectic decor and eclectic clientele was the dining room theme. At the first table near the entrance I saw some of the dishes and the plates were big and the portions were generous. The menu was interesting and the food was good. We shared their fried chicken, and this would be reason alone for me to return. As well as having a fair price point for the caliber and style of cooking. \n\nA couple sat down beside us. Boris and Natashia, they were very nice without being overly chatty. They met each other while mountain biking and Boris left his phone number on Natashia's car windshield.

I very much enjoyed my dining experience here (loved the porch outside with the rocking chairs and the back seats of cars as seating inside!), but was slightly underwhelmed when it came to the food. I opted for the small portion of the gumbo and the shrimp and grits. In the case of the gumbo, it was a bit too salty, and something about the actual soup wasn't quite right in terms of the texture of it. As for the shrimp and grits, again, I had an issue with the texture - they were too runny, and the shrimp barely had any bite to it.\n\nHowever, I did enjoy my cocktail (the lil' rouge corvette, which had Lillet Rouge in it), and the complimentary cornbread with the spicy butter was quite tasty. The dessert, chocolate chess pie with caramel pecan ice cream, was quite good, too.\n\nThat said, I am intrigued by the fried chicken since some fellow Yelpers are saying it's the best they've ever had, so I'm going to have to go back to try that.

The fried chicken was perfection as usual!  The corn meal crust is the crispiest I've ever had!  The crispy full-flavored batter is wonderfully matched by the tender juicy chicken.  One more thing - the chicken was nicely complimented by their fire in the hole hot sauce!

It was gone before we had a chance to try and sample it (greedy bastard).\nThe chicken was awesome! Seasoned perfectly, not greasy. Was served in a popcorn container with a lil popcorn, nice touch. Taste very well on its own, or they had two Front Porch sauces you could pair with the chicken if you like. The mashed potatoes...very creamy. Not overpowering. Very good. Greens are legit, for real. Not overpowering like a lot of places or reeking of vinegar.\nMac N Cheese- I wish they had a larger portion but I guess in the meantime you can just order two+. It was just the way I like it. Nice crusting over the top, crisp edges yet creamy at the same time. Served in a small cast iron dish. The serving however is only enough for 1-2. I recommend everyone order their own.\nBiscuits- They were ok. Please note these are not like the hungry jack or pillsbury many people are usually familiar with. they were two old school rich style Biscuits. And they served them with butter and honey.\n\nDesserts:\n\nOk this is the main thing you need to know about the desserts. Each dessert can be shared between 2 if not 3 people, except the beignets IMO. Or you can do like we did and order different ones and share.\n\nThe biggest winner was the Smores Bread Pudding. OMFG!!! Save room for this. I'm serious. Uh-Mazing. Chocolate sauce at the bottom of the bowl, the ice cream was a perfect match with the bread pudding, but note that it stands very well on its own. If you love chocolate or want something sweet to share, you need this in your life.\n\nPeach Cobbler- Good and rich. Lots of peaches. Defin a dish to be shared..\n\nBeignets- Eh. They were ok. Dusted with powered sugar and some chocolate sauce on the side of the dish. Dip em in your coffee!\n\nDid I mention the winning dessert was the bread pudding?

We went on opening night and while the wait was long, we can tell that it's going to be a great place and we'll probably go back regularly.\n\nThe cornbread with spicy butter was a unique and appropriate combination. My wife had the steak, which was a little spicy for her but I thought it was great. Her steak came with a really good potato salad and grilled corn on the cob. I had built up a hankerin' for the fried chicken after seeing it posted on their menu a few days earlier, but sadly they were out of it and I got a burger. Turns out the burger was very flavorful and cooked perfectly -- crispy on the outside and very juicy inside. \n\nWe were as impressed by the service as we were by the food. It was opening night and things were pretty crazy, but both of the owners found time to stop and chat with us. The staff was very apologetic about the long wait (which was totally understandable -- opening night!) and made sure that we were happy.\n\nWe'll definitely go back to The Front Porch. Not just because it's about 20 steps from our house, but because we now feel like we don't need to go very far at all to get excellent food and service.", "author": "Scott K."}

Our waiter was friendly and explained items on the menu.  We started with the dungeness crab salad, which we both enjoyed.  Anthony started complaining (to me of course) that he just hates waiting a long time for his food.  Then the waiter suddenly brought us (without charging) a pureed pea pesto with chile oil.  I guess for having to wait.  Excellent I thought.  \n\nI had the boneless ribs, very good with an excellent sauce.  Anthony had the chicken, but wasn't too impressed.  I told the waiter it was my birthday, and at the end of our meal, he brought me out a huge dish of vanilla ice cream (at no charge). Very nice.\n\nI was impressed that they had corn pudding and donut holes for desser that were made out of grits.  This could satisfy my gluten free diet.

Our waitress was friendly and hospitable.  \nThe food was okay, nothing spectacular. Maybe my taste buds are shot but after hearing about how great the fried chicken would be, I guess I expected something that was similar to southern fried chicken I had in small towns in Louisiana.  Not so.  One of my dining mates smacked his lips and thought he was eating KFC.  The grit porridge was smoother than I'm used to (I want to taste the GRIT) but the black eyed peas and collards was delicious.  The ceviche had a nice, spicy kick to it.

However, I had the Old Speckled Hen amber ale from the UK, and we split the bucket o'fried with two sides:the charred corn on the cob and the combo of collards and black eyed peas. We also had the potato salad and red beans & rice. The potato salad was supposed to have had creole mustard, but I couldn't detect it, and the rice was flavored with coconut, too. \n\nThe chicken is cooked to order, so it arrived at the table piping hot. And as for me, leave the stale-ass popcorn away from my chicken! As the place filled up, it was quite warm inside; I should have asked them to turn on the ceiling fan.

And I don't throw around that designation lightly.\n\nWe, my southern-fried foodie father and my beau and I, filed in to this sardine of an establishment, full to the gills, with assurances that our middle-of-the-room table normally just for two was, in fact, the \"rock star\" table.  I took the \"rock star\" seat with my butt out in harm's way; so the fact that was bumped only once by a patron, not a server, is tribute to the skill of the bustling waitstaff.\n\nSushi had lost out to \"southern Mission\" tonight by decree of the 6'4\" guy with a fat wallet.  So we order them to bring us every type of fish on the menu that night:  salmon ceviche, tuna tartare, the catfish, and a special swordfish entree.  Father's talked into trying the crab grits, despite fried chicken on the menu.  We decided to round out the meal with the vegan okra dish, the Brussel sprouts, and a side of pickles.\n\nWaiting for food (and avoiding the cute corn bread because, as the help confidently reports to me, it's got wheat flour in it), I spot a steaming bucket floating past us on its way to a far table.  \"That must be the fried chicken.\"  Father whips his head around and looks longingly at the bits of crust you can barely see hidden in the white tube.  We note that it's far from a *full* bucket of chicken.  \"Oh,\" he says, mildly self-satisfied.\n\nThe winner was most certainly the swordfish entree.  Holy moly.  A close second was the tuna tartare.  The salmon ceviche was surprisingly bland; if I'd held my nose I might have guessed it was poached egg white.\n\nFather *hearts* the crab grits.  Yes, Yelp, you win.  Should have avoided the strange vegan dish, which was a lot like eating some kind of canned marinara sauce.\n\nWe get a fun surprise at the end when our head waiter decided to fix me (poor digestively challenged me, with the lack of milk and wheat in my diet) a special dessert -- a huge bowl of poached pears with non-dairy caramel.  Awwww yeah.\n\nTo tell the truth, I could have just kept eating the caramelized Brussel sprouts for dessert.  Occasional dips of That Ketchup.  Oh my yes.", "author": "Naomi M."}

Answer yes to all of these questions, and Front Porch is the eatery for you.\n\nNot only is Front Porch bringing some much-needed variety to the Mariachi dominance of the nether reaches of Mission Street. Not only does Front Porch make me feel cooler than I really am--in a surly, insurgent Bay Guardian kind of way, rather than a effete haute coutuer 7x7 kind of way. Not only does Front Porch look cool inside with the funky low ceiling. Not only is the throng of hipsters too loud to hear the Pixies and Nas playing on the radio. Not only can you cope with the interminable wait by bellying up to the bar down the block at the 3300 Club, only to have the owner of Front Porch personally come and fetch you you're your table's ready. Not only does the waiter offer you a water choice of \"Pellegrino or Hetch Hetchy.\" (Try the Hetch Hetchy and subvert the bottled water racket.) Not only all that and a bucket of corn bread, but the food is great.\n\nThe cod and pepper fritters. Yum. Chicken liver with onion jam. Yum. Fried oysters with pork belly. Quite frankly, doing too much. Every entre I've had there has validated and enhanced my nerd girth--fried chicken, molasses-brined pork chop, pepper pot stew with wild boar and oxtails. It's all meaty and rich and cozy. Instant food coma.\n\nOnly word of caution--the desserts haven't done it for me. They're good, and maybe I'm just worn out by all the fried goodness on the way to dessert, but they haven't excited me.

The first time I was there it was pretty darn good, but it felt like we were being waited on by someone who was \"stepping in\" to help the main servers. That's totally cool with me, but she didn't have all of the answers that our 8 person large group needed. A few other people actually ended up helping her as well...and dude 4 star service is NOT bad at all, but it's just not 5 star. To top it off, now that I've been there a few times and have had that same server I know what to expect. She's a nice person though, so she'll keep getting 20% from me. \n\nThe food was spectacular - maybe 4.25 stars if I were on some kind of warped 5 star version of Star Search. With 8 people I think we actually tried everything that was on the menu, and while I will agree that the fried chicken is quite awesome, the side dishes are what will drive me back down there. \n\nThey have wine, wine coctails, beer, and regular fare for drinks and a pretty nice jug wine that you should try for $24 if that sounds like your cup of tea...um...or jug of wine...anyway..\n\nThe location actually makes me want to move away from the crappy restaurants like Magnolia and the Alembic that I live by now, which probably think they're nearly as good as The Front Porch.

Pretty much anywhere the protector of our ozone layer eats I'm cool with eating. It is dark and homey and very crowded.

We were told that it would be a 25-35 min wait for a table for two. NP..we thought..we headed to the bar for our wine-in-a-juice box. An hour later...we were still waiting..and were slightly irritated. The manager, Kevin, was sincerely apologetic and offered us a delicious app to hold us over (and his charming smile definitely helped, too) \nFinally. after waiting for an hour..we were finally seated...right next to the front door. It was a bit drafty..but we were so hungry we didn't care. \nThe two of us shared the bistro salad, pork chop, and of course the fried chicken. The fried oyster in the bistro salad was delicious...I could have had 10 of them. We finished everything on our plates..and ordered the fried Plantains for dessert. \nDespite the long wait, my experience with the service was dramatically different from my first time there. I can tell that the entire staff is making an earnest effort to improve their service.

Soon after we got our drinks and some bar nuts,  the gracious and cute host/manager seated us(after a less than 10 min wait). We were off to a great start! I liked the funky decor and even the luxurious panel ceiling that looked out of place at any front porch...I had visions of a 6-star yelp review.\n\nAfter scanning the menu, the three of us decided on the bucket of fried chicken with two sides and I couldn't resist the crab porridge.

I thought the food was even better than before (and it was great then). \n\nWe started with the oyster beignets and gumbo.  Now, I really don't like fried oysters but my partner does. Well, with this dish I'm a convert: the beignets were light and crispy and not soggy and greasy like some fried oysters I've had before. The bread pudding base was an interesting contrast. Gumbo is one of those things that always sounds good but rarely lives up to expectations, often being stodgy, gummy, or worse. The Porch's is superb! A great mix of flavors with just enough soup, chicken and sausage and spice to satisfy. Actually, it might satisfy a little too much for an appetizer.  \n\nFor main course we had the slow roasted pork, the court bouillon and the tostanes.  I only tasted the pork but it was moist and succulent and received rave reviews from my partner. I couldn't get enough of the court bouillon \"liquor\" in which bathed the baby veggies and tomatoes - a few less tomatoes and a few more veggies would have been good. The fish was perfectly cooked - moist yet flakey. The tostanes were crispy plantain fritters with pickled onions and avocado. I love pickled onions! This dish was another hit.\n\nAnd apart from the food, what a cool, friendly place! I love the low lighting which might not be to everyone's taste.

There are many reasons to lump them together gastronomically, especially when you own a restaurant and can do whatever the hell you want.\n\nI first heard of Front Porch in a discussion of \"fried chicken in the city.\" I was skeptical, as a native Texan, that anyone in San-Fran-Cis-Co could do fried chicken right, but this was right around the time that I began to loosen my standards of who-can-cook-what, and how.\n\nFront Porch is right on so many levels, it's hard to describe. We ate there last night, my fourth time. I've had something different every time, and it's all been amazing. I've sampled dishes my friends ordered, and same thing. Therefore, I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the entire menu is amazing.\n\nThe place is very intimate, in a hard-scrabble, Emmy's Spaghetti Shack way. It looks like a house with walls knocked out, which it very well may be. But, like Emmy's, it's tiny. So either arrive early, get a large group and make a reservation, or get ready to wait. If there are openings and it's not too cold, get a drink and sit (you guessed it) on the front porch in a rocking chair. If it's too crowded and the wait is long enough, head down to Mission to the 3300 Club.\n\nLast night, I had a ros bubbly paired with fried chicken. Wow. Great pairing, and wow. Their chicken has a homemade-plus-awesome taste. And of course, it's so much more than \"homemade,\" cuz if you made this at home, you'd have the mess to clean up too.\n\nTara R. suggested the place is romantic, and after some thought, I have to agree (see Emmy's comment, above).

The place is crazy full, hopping with life, with this southern-esque casual, hip vibe I haven't felt since Austin, Tx.  \n\nI met some friends there, sitting at the bar, and despite my chest cold the cute and vivacious bartender convinced me to sample the mulled wine.  This mulled wine was magic and perfect for how I was feeling.  Warm in the hand and warm in the chest, and the perfectly balanced spicing was positively therapeutic.  It's easy to screw up with the clove (I've done it lots), but I was in love with it.\n\nIt took us a while to get seated (more on that later), but once we did, we just poured over the menu.  Lots of choices--from the light to the hearty.  Ceviche-salmon that night,  to fried chicken, available in a bucket if you plan on sharing.  I ordered the special--pork rubbed with savory, spicy seasoning, with cubed grilled sweet potatoes. My friends ordered chicken livers (!) and brussel sprouts, and the vegan special with an order of the salmon ceviche to start.  \n\nAll of the food was fabulous!  The cornbread and sweet-butter while we waited for our order was fabulous on their own and inspired me to make cornbread (not as good as theirs) the next day. The ceviche was light and flavorful.   While I'm not a fan of livers or of brussel sprouts, I'd order both myself on another visit; they were flavorful, but not overpowering as these can sometimes be. The serving of pork was healthy, moist, and seasoned to accentuate the taste of the meat. The vegan special was hearty, well-balanced, and tasty. \n\nOverall, the food at The Front Porch lived up to its buzz.  The service however was a little subpar. My friends were on the list for a seat at 6:30, were told that the wait would be a long while.  So they stepped out for a bit, returned to the bar and waited for their names to be called.  Finally we grabbed the host to see what was up and he acted surprised that we were still there--claiming he had called our name at 7:30, which was a bold lie, since we were sitting at the bar near the door finishing our first round of drinks at that time.  And our waitress was capable, but a drone.  Man, she was positively robotic.  So, I suppose she was okay, but not very attentive, and certainly at odds with the cozy, homey vibe of the rest of the place.  But the bartender--she get's thumbs up!  I'm glad she talked me into the mulled wine.\n\nI'll definitely go again, but plan to wait to be seated.

He had trouble explaining the menu, didn't refill our water, and waited way too long to get back to us at the end of the meal -- another person on staff ended up handling our check for us. The waiter's worst mistakes, though, occurred when I sent back some undercooked fish. He took it back to the kitchen but didn't know what would happen next -- would I get a replacement, and if so, when? When he finally returned, he said the kitchen was preparing a new serving for me, for which they were \"overcooking\" the fish, implying that my judgment about its preparation were incorrect. (I made sure to tell him at the end of the meal that the replacement fish had been cooked properly and correctly.) No comp, which might have been appropriate, given that the new fish came out at the same time as my companions were ready to order dessert.\n\nDespite this bad service, I'll probably go back, as I still like the food. Okay, the correctly cooked fish wasn't phenomenal, but it was good enough, and I liked the pickled vegetables that came with it. Still liked the grits with crab, and the house salad with pineapple dressing is a good deal.\n\nUpdate, 3/2007: Went here for the second time last night and again had a great time. We waited at the bar, where the friendly bartender served us beer and wine. Our table for two was ready sooner than we thought it would be, and we were served by a nice man named Alejandro. Great people watching, mellow and funky atmosphere, low-key despite the crowds.\n\nThe fried okra was awesome. Really. Not too greasy, tasty cornmeal batter, yummy bits of okra. We had the fried chicken, grits, and Brussels sprouts again because we'd enjoyed them so much the first time around, and the choices were again right on. Well, the sprouts were a bit too sweet/overly treated with molasses. No room for dessert, alas.\n\nOriginal review: Went here last night with J., P., and R., and very much enjoyed the experience. The vibe was mellow and comfy, but it was only because we arrived before opening that we were able to get in without a wait. That's the secret.\n\nGood food! I enjoyed the salmon ceviche, which was not particularly Southern but was particularly tasty. J. and R. has nice-looking mixed greens, and P. enjoyed soup. For the main course, J. and I shared a fried chicken plate and a crab grits porridge. Yum! The chicken was moist and tasty. I'm not so into black-eyed peas, but they were good for what they were. The crab was tastylicious. We ordered Brussels sprouts on the side, and they seem to have been sweetened with molasses, in a good way. Underwhelmed by the trio of fries -- I just wanted the regular potato kind.\n\nService was friendly and mostly timely, although we had to wait for our check. We'll be back.", "author": "Tara M."}

I'm reluctant to give 5 stars because I don't want to see any more hipsters in there, I already see waaay too many. But I happen to love The Front Porch, and not just for Kevin. \n\nTo be honest, the food can be hit or miss. I have had dishes that lacked sparkle. Still, there is something about the atmosphere (dark, eclectic, rockin') that kind of makes me not care about that. They have a nice little menu that usually has something new to try, along with some more permanent items that are definitely worth revisiting. The pickled veggies are a good pre-starter. Watch out though, sometimes they are super-vinegarized, you might pickle your face-hole. The grits are so creamy and comforting, the burger is tasty, as are the brussels sprouts and  the bistro salad. Vegan entrees can be delicious, but they can also seem like someone cleaned out the veggie bin in the fridge. Mostly, though, find an excuse to use the house-made ketchup and hot sauce. The boy says he would eat through a mountain of babies just to get his share of those tasty condiments. \n\nMy only real beef with TFP is that I have had some BAD service there.

That person would be me. \n\nI would like to begin by doing a bit of fellow-Yelper smearing. I do not understand why there are so many reviews on here bemoaning the fact that you can not bring an enormous group of people into a small, quaint resteraunt on a weekend and feel not feel a bit squeezed. This is San Francisco people. Almost all of the good restraunts are small and not good for groups over 5, and have lines out the door on Fridays and Saturdays. Get over it, or do not frequent these places with your larger-assed friends. Also interesting is the constant bitching by Yelpers of the sides and appetizers being small. They are well within the average size of a non-entree item. Again, bring your overeating friends to the lone KFC in San Fran if they would like their fried chicken to come with a bucket of slaw and mashed potatoes. \n\nIf, however, you and your friends would enjoy a flavorful yet crispy fried chicken, great grits, crab, and a host of other comfort food options at a reasonable price (for reasonably good food in a great setting in San Francisco), please do try Front Porch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-09-02", "description": "Didn't expect to like it. But I did.\n\nWe had a party of 6. We ordered family style. The appetizers (Ceviche, Tuna Tartar, and Cucumber/Watermelon Raddish salad) were really tasty. Then we had a jug of wine, a bucket of fried chicken, and the down-home sides to go with. Plus some fish & chips on the side just for good measure.\n\nThe quality of the food was all great. Sashimi-grade tuna in the tuna tartar, organic chicken in the bucket of fried chicken, really fresh fish for the fish & chips.  And the seasonings were just right on everything. \n\nSome of the portions were too small (an order of corn is half an ear? And that's one of the options with a full bucket of chicken?). But the chicken was fairly generous, and we actually didn't finish it.\n\nThe wait staff was friendly, the atmosphere warm, fun, ecclectic in that perfect San Francisco way, without the attitude that can sometimes be the downside of the perfect SF mix. I do think the server should have warned us about the small portions, given that we had 6 people & were ordering for the table. The jug of wine is a fun idea, but the wine itself was not so great. \n\nAnd for the full experience, I have to include these random parts of the evening: while waiting for a table we had drinks at the dive bar on the corner, where the blue-collar guys knocking back stiff drinks gave a thumbs up review of the front porch. One fellow told me \"the chicken good; succulent & lightly battered, not too heavy\". And it was true. I love that in SF you can get good food reviews from the truck-driver barfly.\n\nThen, at the end of the night, while taking advantage of the all-night bart service (due to the bay bridge closure), we were critiquing the restaurant.  After going on a bit we discovered that the executive chef was standing right next to us. She was very gracious, asked for feedback, we gave some, she told us they're scrambling a bit 'cuz they didn't expect so much attention right away, and she invited us back for another bucket of chicken, on her. I love it. I will be going back, in a month or so, and see what they come up with to refine the concept further.", "author": "Jo R."}

Unfortunately, I am not a miner out there looking for those gems, in fact I am a big slacker when it comes to heading out to the Mission. Thankfully, a friend decided to celebrate his birthday in a gem of a restaurant in the Mission called Front Porch. \n\nAmbiance (4): As you walk in you are greeted by rocking chairs which reminded me of Cracker Barrel (a Southeast roadside eatery institution), except these are worn and not for sale. The inside is divey but not dirty and there is kitschy stuff on the wall. It's a tiny place but I liked it and it fit the comfort food they serve perfectly.  \n\nFood (4): The food was great. I really wanted to give it a 5 but was not as happy with the fried chicken as I wanted to be. We had collard greens and mashed potatoes (deep South what? greens outshined the potatoes...shocking!), fried goodness: oysters, onion rings, shrimp, mushrooms, pickles (everything was juicy and the oysters...bursting with goodness, see if you can just get a basket of those bad boys by themselves), mac and cheese (all that cheese must be sinful, if they had dropped some truffle oil on that I would have eloped with it), beans and rice (really good and underappreciated), fried catfish and hush puppies (not greasy, just right), sweet potato fries (a bit too skinny or overfried), strawberry shortcake with a candle (candle was waxy but that dessert was spot on, and I am not a dessert guy and by no means a fruit guy) and finally fried chicken.  \n\nI think a conversation about Front Porch must gravitate around fried chicken. When a restaurant serves fried chicken, they have to bring their A game. And of course if it's on the menu, diners should check it out, especially when they lure you in with someone's special/secret recipe; Momma's, Bob's, Aunt X, etc. Front Porch's chicken is served in a bucket of popcorn...why I dunno, but it was certainly not good popcorn I can tell you that. One thought I had is that it keeps the chicken from sitting in its own grease, which then makes it a novel idea, just don't eat the popcorn. The chicken is extremely juicy...even the white meat. In fact, everything they fried was pretty juicy so have at those fried items on the menu. The bucket comes with a mix of white and dark meat and unfortunately I was sitting next to a dark meat lover, so I was relegated to one chicken wing and a whole lot of half breast pieces. Despite the chicken between juicy, I was disappointed with the breading. Years of thick coated, fast food restaurant chicken trained me to prefer a substantial tasty coating or a crunchy exterior (I know it's unhealthy). Even though it had a tasty coating, it was very thin and this can be disappointing especially when dealing with the chunky breast pieces. Don't get me wrong, it's good chicken, I just have different preferences.\n\nOh and Front Porch bottles their own hot sauce (or get sauces with their labels on it). They have hot one and a hotter one. Amateurs need not apply to the hotter one.\n\nService (4): Everpresent smile, attentive with the jugs and 40s of water (you read that right), overall great service. The servers seem to fit right in and I have no complaints. Usually Service gets a 3 for standard good service, but the fact they kept those jugs of water coming is something that unfortunately you don't see at most restaurants. \n\nValue (5): Everything is well priced and if you go the route of family style, it's a great bargain. Just don't overorder like we did. I know the basket of fried goods is tempting but don't order 5. Corkage fee of $10 is unheard of, but so is having fine wine with Southern comfort food, so it's a perfect price point.\n\nOverall: I loved this place. The food was right on and the service was great. I would definitely go back and you should too. To be honest my only deterrent is the deep South Mission location. Driving all the way down there and parking is a drag for me. Don't let that deter you though, you need to check out this place to get your vitamin F(ried).", "author": "Alvaro H."}

The menu sounded fantastic. \nWe got there and the hostess told us it would take about 30 minutes and directed us to the 3300 club down the street. I guess they have something worked out where the restaurant patrons will go the club and the hostess will call the bartender and let him know your table is ready. Really symbiotic relationship. \nWell we did just that except we were never called. After an hour of waiting we went back and the hostess had apparently mistaken another couple for us. Minus 1-star. But then she offered us free mold wine which was delicious - okay you get the star back. \n\nThe restaurant is cozy and smell amazing. Very clean and comfortable. Really chill mood. Dim lights and a little jazz. \n\nWhy 3-stars? I don't consider this a bad  rating. I think it means adequate but nothing fantastic. \n\nWe had the cajun shrimp on a bed of grits. Tasted great but for $11 we only got 3 shrimp and the grits were more liquid than grits. You can go to Little Skillet and get a ton of grits with butter, andouille sausage and cheddar for $5 and it's amazing. \nThe fried okra was okay. nothing really spectacular. \nHe had the chicken fried steak which was very good, clean but it lacked imagination. \nThe fried chicken was fried. But it lacked flavor. I was expecting something spicier and richer. The chicken itself was moist but it really left something to be desired. \n\nOverall, we enjoyed the atmosphere but the food lacked the creativity we were hoping for.

I have to say \"Meh\" really summed it up for me. At $21 the flounder is the second most expensive entree, but feels pretty \"home style\" in a way I could recreate camping, pretty underwhelming. The jambalaya, described elaborately as \"blue crab and tasso ham\" sounds great! Tasted nothing special, under seasoned and had the consistency of bad risotto. Pretty dark, so I'm not sure if there was crab at all, I certainly didn't taste it. There sure was plenty of it though! The fish was a basic pan fried affair, and needed something (even a lemon wedge would have helped.) The \"special\" sangria was really diluted, and had more fruit rinds and pulp than actual fruit (this is the height of summer!) Service was fine, but everyone had the air they were closing soon (I think we were there with still an hour to go before they do), paying more attention to their tumblers of wine at the bar than the fact I need another knife please!

My friend and I got a chance to dine at The Front Porch last night and we both agreed that this is one of our new favorites.  \n\nThe place is a block from Emmy's, and provides the only knock on the experience, which is parking.  Entrance is through a very cute porch area with a few seats.  The inside is homey and comfortable with the immediate smell of home cooked food, namely fried chicken.  \n\nDuring a short wait for our table we spent some time at the bar where the service was friendly and fast.  My friend simply HAD to try the wine in a juice box which was a quite nice Pino Grigio from Three Thieves that was literally served in a juice box.  It's quite an experience to drink wine out of a grade schoolesque juice box.  \n\nOnce seated we started with the Pickled veggies and egg dish.  The picking was perfect.  Not too much yet enough to give the right flavor.  The veggies included green been, carrots and yellow beats.  Very tasty.\n\nAfter much discussion over the menu we decided upon the fried chicken with grits on the side and a salt cod dish that was not on the menu that included a half and half of fried and pan seared cod.  We also, serendipitously, ordered the fresh crab risotto.  The best accident I have ever made.  The risotto was one of the best I have ever had.  Order this dish.  Period.  If they are out it will be because I am sitting at the bar eating your helping.  \n\nThere's a nice wine list with very affordable options.  The Three Thieves boxed Cabernet is not quite up to par but decent.  There's a decent choice of beers and the service was very friendly and fast.  \n\nIn case you haven't figured it out I amhigly recommending The Front Porch.

Since it had recently been reviewed we figured on a wait.  After arriving at 6:30 we were told it would be a 30 min. wait and they kept to their word.  The host was very friendly and sweet.\n\nThe interior is cozy and cute but did get pretty loud with the place full.  We sat next to the bar and had I known it would take our server ages to even ask us for a drink order I would have gone up to the bar in the first place.  I have to commend them on their beer menu - some less than obvious choices with two cask brews served at room temperature the way many beers are meant to be served.  That said, the goblet of beer that finally arrived at the table was half full (or half empty depending on your perspective).  When the cask brew ran out half way through my second beer the bartender did make a visit to our table to explain and then gave me the remains plus a full draft beer to make up for it and then kindly asked if we were into the Emmylou Harris that she was playing (we were...).  Aside from our flighty server the service was quite friendly overall.\n\nThe food was so-so.  The hierloom tomato salad was tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  There are so few places to get good grits in San Francisco that I had to order the crab and grits porridge which was very good.  My partner ordered the corned beef hash special which was basically the same as the grit porridge but with hash and greens instead of crab.  The fried chicken was good but not great and a tad pricey (the Colonel's $9.99-sized bucket but for $29).  The black eyed peas and cole slaw that came with the chicken were both just adequate.\n\nThis is one of those restaurants that I would go to again but only if I was with a group of people bent on eating there.

They can sometimes have beginners luck. \n\nSo I've been twice now ... most recently for a birthday dinner for my friend, Jimmy. Born and raised in the south, i can say a few things about Sothern cooking that are totally legitimized at FP:\n- you can never add too much butter to anything\n- corn should never come out of a can\n- grits can be eaten at any meal\n- fish is best served fried\n- salad is the place for expressing your creativity\n\nI love this place. The food is great ... it's expensive, but you don't feel ripped off because you leave full and the food is unique and delicious. The wait staff are really nice (and really hot) scenester types with no detectable attitude. \n\nA tip of the hat to other reviewers ... it IS loud in there and yes, there is usually a line. However, we went on monday night at 7pm and only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table. The bartendress was fun and chatty and the time flew by.

I will provide my own spin, however, to educate and illuminate.\n\nLife is about moments, and to me, a fine moment is one where you get to stop talking, eating, and drinking for a minute and just look around.  When I have a moment, it's seeing a fine dinner spread out, a friend mid-laugh, a half-full drink and a mostly empty bottle, and feeling of mirth and content. \n\nThe Front Porch for me always seems to perfectly synthesize the moment.  I've been a few times now, and had good conversations with the barkeeps, servers, and patrons.  I've made offbeat comments regarding their facial hair, and they throw it right back at me.  They smile and chuckle when we make sexy noises with phallic cornbread and slippery honey butter.  The patrons share their stories, breaking the ice with our communal love for buckets of popcorn and chicken.  And no one bats an eye.  The dark, low-slung interior perfectly captures an atmosphere of intimacy and mystery, sort of like a fog of war encouraging you to open up and explore.  \n\nWhat started as a quest for fried chicken and real grits has become a small slice of southern Xanadu (a la Kublai Khan, not a la ONJ).  It feels like home.  Hell, one of the owners even has some West Virginia in him.\n\nSo take friends, take your special someone, take someone from off the street . Put your name on the list, and then wander up the corner to the bar and chat over drinks (it'll be about 45 min or longer.  Bring discussion topics).  When your table is ready, roll back down and order half the menu.  It's the perfect way to have a moment.", "author": "Cracker J."}

We had a very funny moment where I tried to put my fork in one to move the puppy from the serving bowl to my plate. I could not get my fork to break through the cemented, cornmeal shell and the force of my fork made the puppy leap from the plate and shoot off the table. Luckily I caught it before it hit the ground. Then I spent 10 minutes chewing the densest cornmeal concoction ever created. Over the weekend I had fabulous hushpuppies at Mother's Bistro in Portland. Go there - or Kate's Kitchen, or the South - for hushpuppies. \n\nGumbo was edible, but not very good. How could so many ingredients create so little flavor?? Nothing compared to Yat's in that bar in the mission or the good stuff served by the witchy women at the annual ho-down at El Rio. Or the stuff in New Orleans. \n\nFried okra made me want to cry... in disappointment. The batter wasn't crispy and didn't have any taste! The dipping sauce tasted like plain mayo! The okra was just sad to be in such a demeaning position. \n\nThe jar of pickles: Loved them. They were tasty and fresh. Worth $6? No, but they were the best food item consumed.\n\nFree cornbread. THIS IS NOT GOOD CORNBREAD. I am shocked that people like this stuff. Maybe they gave me the three day old leftovers? \n\nThe pecan pie. This was good, thank god. Not worth a trip to try it and not the best, but edible. \n\nBut the kicker: this all cost us $80 with one beer each. I would put the tastiness of this food on par with Hard Knox cafe on 3rd street, where a big entree and two sides costs $10 and the quality of the food is questionable (although the preparation is ok). That price is about right for this food too.

Our experience started off well, when a 30 minute wait turned into just 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe interior decor is beautiful, at least as far as one can tell from the dim lighting. The other diners were having good times with friends, with much laughing and even some shouting. The very loud thumping bass of Led Zep's \"Kashmir\" added to the party atmosphere.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the dim lighting made it difficult to read the menu, and the loud music meant that we had to shout our orders several times to the waiter before he understood us.\r\n\r\nThe food did not take long to arrive, a fact for which we were grateful because the elevated sound level made conversation difficult and had transformed the music from fun to annoying. \r\n\r\nThe portions of our dishes were small. Two of us ordered the veggie porridge, which was very tasty. Unfortunately, the bowl in which it was served was deceptively small, holding little more than a half-cup. While flavorful, the size seemed more suited to an appetizer than a main dish with a price of $9.50. \r\n\r\nOne of our party order the fish and chips, which he liked very much. He couldn't tell what the fish was (it changes based on the day's catch) but the chunks and the batter was interesting and pleasing.\r\n\r\nAnother friend had the fried chicken, crunchy and well-done, with a batter of unusual and intriguign batter. Tender was the first piece. However, each piece of chicken was increasingly dry, so that by the end of the basket, my friend had trouble swallowing the meat without an accompanying sip of water.\r\n\r\nThe desserts were also problematic. The apple crisp was full of apple, but had no crisp. My yellow cake slice was small, and had the consistency of a Duncan Hines mixture that had failed to rise.\r\n\r\nOnly one of us said that he would return to The Front Porch to try another dish (he would not order the fried chicken again).

I've had better boxed rice.  Sorry...I'm Asian.  If you serve me crunchy ass old rice...I am offended.  Learn how to cook the shit or don't offer it.  Even the Uncle Ben's rice pilaf at Circus Circus is better than this.  C'mon!!!! Hopefully for them, it was an off night and/or so busy they gave rice-making duty to the rocking chair.\n\nVery glad that we ordered potatoes as well or I may have given a 2 star rating.\n\nScratching head at the different flavored beans option as well. Buttered beans for the individual serving, and coconut for the bucket?  Mashed potatoes then rice????  WTF?  Maybe the place has an identity crisis.  Fried chicken, frisee, fried plantains, and confit?  Hmmm.  One would think that a place that offered frisee AND confit would, at the very least, know how to boil rice.  Sorry, back on the rice thing.  Guess I was more traumatized than I thought.  Taste your shit before you serve it, yo.\n\nAnd...Is it Caribbean or is it soul food?  Picking one and sticking with it may serve them well.  I invite you to come to Oakland and try some real soul food...or Caribbean for that matter (they won't necessarily be under the same roof, btw).  Shooot...go to Popeye's even...it'll give you a 'minimum' to shoot for on your cornbread and rice.  Sorry...had to go there. This place may do well for its clientele, but it wouldn't survive in Oakland.  Even the white-folk out here know them some soul food.  ;p\n\nWant to love this place.  The decor is cute and chicken was DELICIOUS, so were the beans.  Will go back, coz the chicken was THAT good, will hope they'll allow a substition for their crappy-worse-than-Church's-poor-excuse-for-dirty-rice. Man, that hurt my feelings.", "author": "Cris C."}

I had been craving friend chicken and was super excited to have, what appeared from the reviews, to be some of the best in the city.\nLet me start with the good points, and there were many.  They had just started using the Open Table reservations system.  That process went flawlessly.  My date and I arrived early, had a beer each at the bar and were seated early.  Also the place itself is very cool looking.  It feels great and we were both very excited to be there.\nThe staff was very nice.  Everyone was friendly and eager to please.  Absolutely no issues there.\nWe ordered Fried Pickles to start.  They were very good.  Different than I had had in the past.  A thin almost delicate coating.  They were crunchy and salty and served with a very good Aioli.  So far so good.  We were enjoying the experience and the food and were very excited for what was to come.\nThe rest of out meal arrived.  The Mac and Cheese was first.  It was served dangerously hot - as it should be - and was very good.  The collared greens were sweet and tender, a definite winner.  The mashed potatoes were served with a terrific gravy.  They were creamy with a bit of lumpy still in them.  Again very good.\nAs you can imagine, at this point I was really excited about the chicken.  It arrived in a popcorn bucket.  Very cute!  It was crunchy and juicy - cooked just perfectly.  Only one issue - it was absolutely devoid of taste.  It was enough that we sent it back explaining that we thought that they had forgotten to apply any seasoning at all.  The waitress was responsive, brought it back to the kitchen and returned with the bucket several minutes later - again the chicken was without flavor at all.  It wasn't bad tasting, it wasn't good tasting.  It is was simply \"not tasting\".\nSo I return to my search for friend chicken, sad that the Front Porch will not be my go to location.", "author": "Bill G."}

I went to this restaurant with my boyfriend (who is from the south) and two of my friends. When i walked in, I was extremely impressed with the decor. IT was dark and had many unique decorations. The bar area and the restaurant area are not separated and some of the tables are extremely close to the bar area. We were lucky enough to get a booth and the wait was about 15 minutes on a Friday night. When we sat down I was extremely anxious to try the cornbread since the pictures show it to be a large piece of bread in the shape of corn..cute. the waitress came and she was very nice and asked if we were ready. we ordered our dishes....however.....hhhmmmmm no bread was coming. we asked her if we had to pay for it and she replied NO. yet...still no bread. finally it came. The cornbread was extremely small and DRY. How can u mess that up!!!!! My expectations were lowered right then and there. Next as an appetizer we ordered Fried Pickles... the pickles were soggy and waaaaaaaaaaaay too salty. For main dishes we had the following: I had a fried chicken steak with mashed potatoes. it was eeegh...ok nothing at spectacular. My friend ordered a pork chop with greens. The pork chop was dry and burned and she had to return the greens because they tasted as though they were not washed thoroughly and there was sand in them. My boyfriend had fried catfish and said that it quite tasty and saw were his fries. After this disappointing meal, i decided to decline desert. However my brave friend ordered Creme Brulee. UMMMMM please tell me why the entire sugary top coat got stuck to the spoon and came off as one whole piece and it was cold in the middle....did they just MICROWAVE Creme Brulee. \n\nSOOOOOOO ladies and gentlemen.

I wanted to love the place.  I wanted to give it 5 stars.  I wanted to want to come back right away.\r\n\r\nIx-nay on that.\r\n\r\nLet's start with the food.  The ceviche appetizer has promise, but the fried plantains weren't uniformly crispy.  In fact, some were downright soggy-mushy, and that ain't right.  We also had the heirloom tomato salad which was quite good, with a spicy and somehow hearty dressing that made for a nice duo.\r\n\r\nFor the main course, we shared the fried chicken and dungeness crab over polenta (ok, they call it corn grits but it's the same thing).  Fried or baked, roasted or grilled, chicken doesn't belong on a menu unless it's really done right -- it's simply too ubiquitous.  Given the promise of a Barbados-inspired spicy delight, we had high hopes for the Front Porch's fried chicken and were mightily disappointed.  Decent, but totally uninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe dungeness crab, on the other hand, is a stellar dish.  The chili oil seasoning really brings this entree to life - the unexpected flavor combination of the crab, seasoning, and polenta is so much better than I could have imagined.  This is one of those dishes where you're left wondering, \"How the hell did the chef come up with this!?  I'd never have tried putting those elements together in one dish.\"\r\n\r\nOh yeah: avoid the side salad!  Too big, too bland, wrong greens (imo), and I have no idea how it found its way onto the menu.\r\n\r\nThe service was super friendly and remarkably on top of their game for it being the second night of dinner service.  If they can maintain this attitude, the Front Porch will no doubt earn a spot as a neighborhood favorite.\r\n\r\nWe dined kinda early, so it was hard to judge the atmosphere.  We did witness one couple get in a fight, culminating in one of the two throwing her napkin across the table at her friend/partner and then storming off.

A bucket of fried chicken! Fried okura! Interesting wine-based cocktails! Affordable pricing! Located in Bernal Heights! Yep, I REALLY wanted to like this place (I know it's such a yelp clich\u00e9 - bear with me here). \n\nThe minute I walked in, I *thought* I was falling in love with the place. I l love the vintage-y interior and the cozy setup (like how I love Attic). It was like meeting a hot guy for the first time and thinking to myself: \"he's so fine! I am so feeling his style!\" To top it off, the waiter informed us that they offer BBQ ribs every Sunday! I envisioned myself being a \"regular\" here (using the dating analogy, it was like the hot guy telling me that he was working on his PhD in physics. *drool*) \n\nSince this was my first encounter, I decided to play it safe and order the famous bucket of fried chicken with the fried okura. The Louisiana brown ale was good, I was horny, I mean, hungry, and anxiously anticipating the dream meal to unfold in front of my eyes. Soon after we ordered, the fried okura was served. I immediately took a few bites. \n\n......? *took another bite of okura* .....? Does this....taste like deep fried bar food from those chain restaurants, in which I would never been caught dead? OK, I wasn't going to judge a restaurant solely based on fried okura. But still...this made me suspicious.  Again, using the dating analogy, this was as if the hot guy mentioned he was temporarily living at his mom's place (wait, what?)\n\nThen there came the bucket of fried chicken. I hurriedly took a few quick bites like a starving child, and then paused and thought:  the texture is OK. The meat is juicy and not too fat or too dry. But something is missing here? I took a big sip of the brown ale and had another bite of the chicken, this time with a little more care and attention. A few seconds of a denial ensued. Could this be?  Then I took another bite. This time, it was confirmed: the fried chicken at the Front Porch was indeed disappointing. It was completely lacking flavor. It had no magic. Eating the rest of the chicken was like a chore. I was eating it because I was still hungry and I do not like wasting food, but like a hurried office lunch of a Subway sandwich, it was rather functional and not a joyful dining experience (I am grateful that I am not starving, by the way. But since this is a restaurant review, I am not focusing on how blessed I am to have a plate full of food). \n\nThe dining experience at the Front Porch turned out to be a very short-lived infatuation for me. Unfortunately, there was no chemistry betweeen us whatsoever. It just so turned out that he wasn't working on his PhD in physics; he was just a pot head who was once enrolled in some \"graduate level\" online courses titled \"Connection between Ancient Eastern Philosophy and Quantum Physics.\" \n\nI mean, he was hot.

While I believe I would still have given The Front Porch 5 stars if my friend didn't know the chef, her personal touch--which I believe she probably bestows on all customers in one way or another--made our experience all the more extraordinary.\n\nSo we sat down and got water right away.  The restaurant's got a great ambiance and I admired their shelves by the table with salt and pepper, candle and flower.  \"Real Cute,\" as my friend C-Diddy would say.  \n\nImmediately the chef, who is quite attractive--not that it matters, but she is, brought us fried okra with a great sauce.  It. Was. So. Good.  I am now an Okra fan because of Sarah!  She also brought over cocktails that had rose petals and champagne as main ingredients and those were wonderful as well.\n\nA little later we got cornbread, in the shape of corn on the cob, with sweet butter.  Also so good, and I for one, appreciate the details.  \n\nWe ordered an Heirloom Tomato Salad and it was plated beautifully and tasted even better.  I was eating the sauce after it was all gone.  Really simple, and really friggin good.\n\nBetween the three of us we got a bucket of chicken with sweet corn and black eyed peas and collared greens as our side with an additional side of coleslaw for Les, cause he's a fan.\n\nI    Have    Never   Had  Chicken   So   Delicious!  \n\nShe knows how to use that spice rack.  Seriously, genius with the spices.  The corn was the same deal and the black eyed peas were great too.\n\nWe didn't get dessert because it was halloween and we wanted to be home to give out candy, but they looked great too.  \n\nI will be back for sure!\n\nThanks for an awesome and UNIQUE meal.

Some of the other drinks looked tasty, like the ones my compadres got. It would have been nice if they served liquor though; I was jonesin' for a Jack and Ginger.\n\nWe were finally seated and decided to \"fucket\" and get three buckets (of fried chicken). There were six sides to choose from, and two came with each bucket, so we got all six. The chicken came out and it was absolutely delicious. The breading was nice and crispy, the chicken was the juiciest I have ever tasted, and they were nice, plump pieces. I would have to say, however, that it tasted just a little too lemony, but still probably the best I have had. One thing I thought was kind of weird, though, was that they put the chicken in these huge buckets and filled the bottom with plastic bags or something. So the buckets aren't as big as they look.\n\nThe sides were great too. I especially liked the grits, corn on the cob, and black-eyed peas. All the sides should have been in larger quantities though.\n\nOne thing that was lacking was the service. It took a while to order and get our check. I wasn't too bothered by it, though, because it was a relaxed evening in good company.

I went with a group who above all else wanted the buckets of fried chicken, so that's what we had... three buckets, with two sides per bucket (included) fed nine hungry people. The sides consisted of black-eyed peas with collard greens, grits with chili oil and scallions, and roasted Brussels sprouts doused with chili oil... I suppose the inclusion of chili oil makes this a \"California-esque\" rendition of The South, but I liked it. It was also commented that the grits were \"too creamy; more like polenta.\" Whether that's bad or not I leave to your own discretion.\n\nEverything was tasty, but I was particularly impressed by the fried chicken. The meat was moist but firm, and the breaded and fried exterior was crispy without being oily/greasy--a rarity in the fried chicken world.\n\nOn the adult beverage front, their wine list is a well thought out selection of inexpensive-to-mid-range whites and reds.

Its menu is wonderfully creative as well as standard with Caribbean/American/Soul/comfort food fusion. I want to love this place, especially because I can walk there, but I simply cannot based on my three dining experiences. \n\nNumber one: I ordered the crab n grits, and my friend the bell pepper and salt cod fritters. I had a house cocktail, and it was nice. Unfortunately the person who came to our table (twice? three times? but he came to the tables around us--someone from the kitchen and not our server) was doused in cologne. It was BIG, like the kind you can smell ten feet away and probably came from Walgreens. Anyway I don't care where it comes from, I'm allergic, so I was unable to eat the majority of my meal, due to intense nausea and headache. I had it boxed and was pleasantly surprised while enjoying it the next day. This was amazing! I fell in love with the dish; it was well balanced with some other flavors and I think some chili flake. I wasn't sure whether I'd go back due to cologne fear, but alas, visit #2:\n\nWe split an incredibly delicious and simple and light and perfect beet salad. Also the roasted root veggies, which were an insult to root veggies--bleh--but came with some very rich and flavorful goat cheese. Also the salt cod fritters. I've always theorized that if it's fried, it tastes better. And boy did these. I'm not a fan of salt cod, but all doughed up with sweet peppers and perfectly fried hush-puppy-style, mmmm, it;s good. \n\nOn my first two visits I was so impressed with the ideas and flavors in the vegan one pot stew that i had to order it. This is a special that changes nightly and is a welcome addition to the menu for those of us eating lower (and lowest) on the food chain. I can't remember what all was in it but the tomato sauce it was bathed in was delicious. I had the crab n grits again so I could pack it up and enjoy it at home again.

Tonight, I decided to finally have a taste of this place for myself. The place was a small dim lighted restaurant with a cozy feel. It was very intimate. It only seats about 49 max. They played good music and had extremely friendly customer service.\n\nWhen we first arrived we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. So, we took a seat at the bar and had a couple of drinks as well as an appetizer while we waited. We ordered the porch fry daddy. It consisted of fried shrimp, calamari, oysters, mushrooms, and pickles. The appetizer was okay, it wasn't the greatest fried portion of food I've had. Honestly, I could say I've had better. The batter didn't really stick and was pretty greasy. For our entree we ordered the bucket of fried chicken that came with collard greens and garlic mashers. Once again, I've had better! The only different thing about the fried chicken was that it came in a popcorn bucket with kernels of popcorn scattered around instead of being presented on a regular plate. Other than that it was your generic fried chicken. All in all we paid around $70. We could have gone to Hard Knox and had the same amount of food. No actually, scratch that. We could have had a lot more for around $30.\n\nThere wasn't anything special about this restaurant. We wanted to eat reasonable for the night and ended up spending more than what we expected to. I wouldn't recommend this place for your typical soul food place. You can go somewhere else for much cheaper with better quality food. Basically, you're paying for the atmosphere.

The mood is the room is fun, informal and filled with people in good moods.\n\nPlus, their beer selection is fantastic, with a nice mix of Belgian and English, with a few American classics right in.  They even sell King Cobra malt liquor!! However, when I spilled a bit on the floor (for my dead homeys) they didn't seem to appreciate it.

I came with a party of 5, which understandably is one or two people too big for this place, but the service seemed so rushed. Like I could see the thought bubble over the servers \"hurry up and get out of here\". \n\nWe were wrapping up dessert and my dinnermates were still eating from their cheese plate w/cherries and toast (looked yummy btw), while out of the corner of my eye I could see the bearded server hoovering around us, then finally swooping in, pointing to the cheese plate (only half eaten) and asking \"would you like me to wrap that up for you?\" Um... hello?! We're still eating it for godsake. It was pretty uncomfortable for a moment, like what he really meant was, let me passive-aggressively interrupt the 3 seconds between bites and suggest wrapping up your food (without checking the plate) so your party can get out of here. \n\nThe art of working in food service, or customer service for that matter, is knowing how to read people. Although the servers at our table were nice enough, they need to learn this skill.\n\nLastly, the callaloo soup, which I recommend (taro leaves with seafood), was delicious, but the ridiculously large bowl it's served in --- you know the kinds with a 4-inch rim around it -- is cumbersome and silly. It felt like my arm did a mile stretch from the middle of the bowl to my mouth. Just awkward, you know?\n\nFried chicken, crab grits, greens and everything else was the bomb.\n\n----------------------------------\nOriginal review:\n\nYou've got to get here early for dindin, but I assure you the dungeness crab grits are worth it. \n\nThis place gets packed! The first time I attempted to eat here -- at the late hour of 7:30 no less -- diners were packed into any nook & cranny they could fit into. Having eaten at Emmy's Spaghetti Shack, when the owner/chef cooked there, made me want to get into this super cozy joint even more.\n\nHad a wonderful meal with friends/co-workers, and the crab grits truly made my taste buds sob with joy.

Having been out of the South for a collective 9 years at this point, I don't want to get my heart broken whenever a restaurant claiming to serve soul food is advertised north of the Mason-Dixon and especially west of the Mississippi.  Isn't it enough I have to sweeten my own damn iced tea wherever I go?  \n\nBut a friend was in town and she wanted to try the crab and grits she heard about.  Plus earlier that day it rained so much that mass transit was shot to hell, and we didn't want to trudge to god knows where for dinner.  So it was with great trepidation I approached The Front Porch to at least try it.\n\nWith fears firmly in place, I ordered the one dish that would determine whether or not I would set foot in here ever again: Miss Ollie's Fried Chicken with black eyed peas, collard greens and mac and cheese.  The quintessential southern/soul food plate.  Because you can't get that right, then we're going to have problems.\n\nBut beforehand, we had the fried okra as an appetizer.  It was crispy, warm, pleasant.  Okay, started to relax a bit.  Thought maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  Then our main dishes arrived. The chicken looked nice, smelled good.  The peas and collards were mixed together, which is a new twist, but ok.  The mac and cheese was actually a pie.  Looked alright.  Then I bit into the chicken.\n\nI cannot tell you how freakin' relieved I was to have such a nice blend of tender, juicy meat with the spices and flavorings of the batter used to fry it.   The rest of the meal was excellent as well.  We ended the meal with a lovely pear desert and I with a renewed sense of hope that maybe, just maybe, I can have a taste of home without actually leaving home. \n\nThank you Front Porch!", "author": "Charlotte M."}

Nobody brought menus to us, so Loretta got up and grabbed one from the front; not realizing the clipboard was wooden, she tossed it to me and it slammed onto the table loudly. From then on, the staff was gracious, apologetic, and swift. They even comped us our appetizer.\r\n\r\nThe app was tuna tartar served with plaintain chips. I questioned the pairing because the plaintains overwhelmed the fish, which was very fresh. I learned quickly to alternate the plaintains and the tuna rather than pile the tuna onto the chips. A good start.\r\n\r\nNot hugely hungry, we split the special entree, which was a pork chop propped on some of the best brussels sprouts I've ever tasted, and topped with cole slaw. Comfort food, to be sure, but not the greasy kind that makes you apologize to your stomach afterward. The pork was heavily salted (and peppered) and tender. You wonder if a new restaurant is going to try a pork special and serve you a tough slab; not so here -- the chef knows her pork. Still the pork took a back seat on this plate to the brussels sprouts, which were perfectly cooked through, not mushy, and were kind of carmelized on the outside. As Loretta put it, \"The best are these super fucked-up burnt leaves.\"\r\n\r\nWe had the yellow cake for dessert and were pleased with the chocolate frosting, which wasn't overly sweet, like maybe there was some sour cream in it.\r\n\r\nThe joint is hipster-ish but not oppressively so.

He has been here 3x and raved about it. So as a bunch of chefs we were excited. Service was fine, the ambience was nice and cozy. How ever it stopped after that.\n\nWe were a bit disappointed with the food. 2/3 of us had the fried chicken and while the seasoning was tasty the chicken was over cooked. Too dark and crispy. I had to pluck all the crust off to get to the meat. The mashers was delish and I have to say the green beans was the best dish of the night. Wonderfully saute, seasoned, and my favorite garnished with fried garlic chips. We had housemade pickles and deep fried brandade which was ok. The salt was all over the place. Some were under and some were over.\n\nMy friend ordered the gumbo and sadly to say he didnt finished it. We asked why and he said it was a bit off. I tasted it and it was WAYYYY too salty. Another person tasted it and said the same thing. The third friend, our sous chef, was like \"whoa, you need to send it back.\" Our friend didn't want to \"complain\" and was adamant about not saying anything. I told him, \"if you don't say anything they will continue to serve this over salted food to other patrons.\" So we told one of the runner who picked it up that it was too salty. She said ok and took the plate. Never asked if he wanted something else. Then afterwards he told our waitress that.

I called in advance and was told they don't take reservations for small parties, but that's it's generally easy to get a table. The wait upon arrival was around 40 minutes, which is manageable. We were able to enjoy a couple of drinks at the bar with complimentary free spicy peanuts for our wait and even score on actually sitting in some bar stools while we waited. About 20 minutes in, they offered to let us dine at the bar. I could have cared less since food is food and the bartended was quite nice (they also seemed very appreciative). The whole experience was delightful. Great dinner surrounded by great dcor and great patrons.\n\nThe bartender, despite pouring the entire restaurant's drinks, was very attentive and provided great service. She also gave us the mulled wine I had secretly been wanting to try for free with our desert (its either 'tis the season or she was a mind reader...your call). The pickled veggies (okra and carrots oh my!) to start were amazing. I also tried my first pickled egg and though I was extremely skeptical, it was pretty darn tasty. I went with the glazed pork tenderloin which ordered medium rare turned out to be a tad overdone. My partner went with the fried chicken with mac and cheese, and though terribly awful for my heart, it ranks up as one of the better things I have had the pleasure to taste in quite some time. \n\nExtra, extra stars for the amazing staff!", "author": "Alicia J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-11", "description": "After trying the mediocre Hard Knox Cafe, I had just about given up on SF soul food. I had accepted the fact that I was never going to experience a delicious bucket of fried chicken in SF. I had started to believe that the only way I'd be able to find good fried chicken in the Bay Area is to either: (1) skip work on a Monday and make a journey to Thomas Keller's Ad Hoc for its famous fried chicken, or (2) put my life on the line and sneak into the warzone ghetto of Oakland (where I would assume there would be good soul food). But a trip to Napa is too much of a celebratory event and I also don't want to be the next murder victim on the Oakland evening news, so I wish there were some good soul food in SF.\n\nHallelujah for The Front Porch.\n\nIn my opinion, the Front Porch has the best soul food I've ever tasted. And although against the will of my arteries, I've definitely had my share of soul food. I loved every aspect of the restaurant from the hometown feel and the cheerful waitresses to the vast drink selection and PHENOMENAL food.\n\nWent with a group of 3 and we got seated immediately around 6:30pm on Thursday. Once it gets to around 7-7:30pm though, the place gets packed, so definitely try to make reservations if you can. \n\nWe ordered the bucket of fried chicken w/ mashed potatoes & green beans, the chicken fried steak on top of mashed potatoes & sweet corn, the fried chicken liver on a cheese biscuit with habanero jelly, side of the baked mac and cheese, and the red velvet cake for dessert. The fried chicken was probably one of the best, if not the best, I've ever had -- perfectly crispy on the outside and moist as hell on the inside. 9 pieces of chicken will set you back $33, but lemme tell you, every bite was worth it. Douse that sucker with tons of their Louisiana Crystal hot sauce and you're good to go. The chicken fried steak was also great -- crazy heavy, but the mixture of the steak and the mashed potatoes was awesome. I usually don't like chicken liver, but their fried chicken liver was really good. The baked mac & cheese was insanely good. And the red velvet cake was a great way to end a \"I'm probably going to have a heart attack after this\" dinner.\n\nNow, just FYI, this may be soul food, but it's soul food for those who have wealthy souls. If you're used to a bucket of chicken being $10 for a family meal, this isn't the place for you. It's nowhere near as cheap as Hard Knox Cafe or most soul food joints for that matter, but for the top-quality food and service, The Front Porch is worth every penny. For the 3 of us, we spent $120 after tip for a ton of food and drinks all around. Not TOO bad.\n\nDefinitely one of my absolute favorite restaurants in SF.\n\nI wish I was black just so I could say: \"Ah, this fried chicken is just like how Big Mama used to make it.\" Maybe in another life.", "author": "Roy C."}

The server didn't get pissy about repeating the specials (I must have asked at least two times since one person arrived late), we got our drinks. refills, etc. at a decent pace.   \n\nHonestly, don't we all dine out for the food, though?  I know this place is wicked hip but I was underwhelmed by the dishes (with the exception of the delicious fried chicken).  I found the appetizers to be smallish, the crab porridge uncomfortably spicy and the crab tasted pickled.  I ordered the seafood special (shrimp and grits finished with a chive or garlic oil) which was just like the crab porridge, minus the crab.   Didn't have dessert (yay, Mitchell's!) so I can't form an opinion.   I wasn't impressed or too terribly disappointed so I'd give the food portion of this review 3 stars.", "author": "Laura P."}

Two of my friends tried the pickled plate--some things were good, others not. \n\nEntrees:\n\nThe Crab porridge was the best...it was amazing.

Within 15 minutes the crowd was waiting outside in the rain to get in.\n\nThe service was a little slow, but it was my first time there and i needed the extra time. Some very decent beers on tap and the wine list looked good although I was drinking beer and did not make a deep study of it.\n\nFRIED CHICKEN  is maybe my favorite meal and there isn't much in this city. So when I hear the chicken is good, I need to try it. So the chicken - 3 pieces - was very good, not greasy so cooked hot and the resulting bird was cooked inside but not dry; and the skin is crispy - not oily. If you like greasy, nasty chicken you might think this dry, but its just  the way it should be. Its good bird, as good as I have had in the west ... the rest of the meal was interesting, the greens for a side and fried potatos (yams, regular and sweet I think) were really good and flavorful.\n\nThe service after the initial wait was good and friendly. The place was just getting crowded so service might slow down a bit as the dinner crush is in full force. but I'd give a good mark for sure, better than most outside the high end.\n\nSo on the closing topic, value... the food was very good, I originally thought $25 for 3 pieces of chicken, some greens, fries and a beer was a little higher than I was thinking it should be. It not outrageous at all since you'd pay $10 for the \"same\" at KFC or Churches. So its a good value in my mind, and its a cool place with friendly people and of course, good fried chicken. \n\nIts worth a trip, especially if you like chicken deep fried, go early on the weekends or don't be in a hurry.", "author": "JX C."}

It seems like a true local's restaurant where you can walk in on a weeknight wearing whatever (I myself arrived in gym shorts and running shoes) and be treated to a hearty meal of some of the better soul food in the Bay Area. The Porch goes lighter on chicness and decor and heavier on the stick-to-your-ribs grub than, say, Farmer Brown. I put it this way: Farmer Brown is known for its artisan cocktails, the Porch for its finely curated beer list. That I think says something about the differences between them. \n\nAnyway, here's what can't be missed: the fried chicken, which has an exceptional dark crust (cornmeal?) and moist, tender white meat (pairs well with the house-made hot sauce). The coconut red beans, which mix a memory of Caribbean and Indian cooking into an otherwise Southern-style dish. The bread pudding is, no exaggeration, the best I've ever had. Terrific corn bread. The grits with crab is thick and creamy like a good chowder. \n\nWhat I'd do differently: No side dishes of collard greens? Come on! Also, the rice pudding was pretty poor: lacked the consistency of a true pudding, tasted more like rice floating in warm milk. \n\nBut all in all, since we shared dishes and relied on the sides as much as the entrees, it was $20-$25 per person including tip!

The cabbage in the slaw was minced so finely it was mushy and the mac was pretty dry. The crab and grits and beet salad were good, but not really that memorable.

I love southern food and am thankful to have tried this place so I can go back. All in all this place is a 3 on yelp but more like a 2.5 for what I used to for southern grubbin. Cool area of town too bars right up the street, its practically in the mission. We had a few different things.\n\nThe Fried Green Tomatoes were solid, and would order again. The Blue Crab fritters were too doughy for me being a maryland man. The Catfish wasn't at all what expected and prefer good ole fried catfish myself. The roux on the creole was 100% burned, our server told us that dark roux's can taste that way but I'm no moron that shit was burnt. I've been eating southern food in the south for over a decade and it was certainly burnt. The chicken was nice and moist inside with crispy skin but the meat just a little salty. Probably a salt heavy brine would be my guess. The collards were good and not pork fatty at all which was a pleasant surprise. I liked the mac and cheese others at the table didn't. Sweet potato fries and mashed potatoes were both good. My one friend had the burger and said it was \"fire,\" it looked awesome A couple others had the steak and said it was \"aight,\" meaning to me it was probably not all that good. \n\nI'd be more inclined to return for lunch instead of dinner and check those dishes out and still be able to get the things I liked. I would also still like to try the grilled fish of the day cause i think the preparation on it sounds delicious and the pork chop, I have a feeling its brined too ;)", "author": "Michael B."}

So we drove up after Super Bowl last night. \n\nA friend had tried this place out prior to us visiting last night and mentioned how good the fried chicken was. So we decided this would be the place to hang out for a little while.\n\nWe arrived at the restaurant around 8:30 - 9 pm-ish and got seated. Right off the bat, I noticed how attentive and friendly the waitress was. She dropped off the drink menu and kindly mentioned that if we wanted to order food, we'd have to do it quickly as the kitchen was closing in 3 minutes. My little group was a bit hesitant to get food so late but I  convinced them to order a bucket of chicken. Seeing as we're hardly in the city, I wanted to try or lord knows when I'll get another chance anytime soon.\n\nWe flagged down our waitress and she came by and took our drink order. I liked how she tried to recommend what she thought was good. We mentioned we wanted to order food and she looked at the clock and said that the kitchen closed a minute ago, but she'll get our order in. Most other places, we would have been shut out. \n\nWe got our beer order and I want to comment on one beer in particular that was served for Beer Week... Firestone bourbon barrel-aged Velvet Merkin oatmeal stout. The stout was amazingly yummy. It had a very pleasant taste (reminiscent of coffee) and unlike most stout, was not as hearty or thick. But I liked it none the less. Tasty! A bit disappointed the Triple Daddy was not available.. Oh well.\n\nThey brought out our place settings, water, and two hot sauces. The waitress quickly pointed out the yellow one and said \"be careful, that one is habanero.. use sparingly\". Well three of the five of us perked up. Interest was piqued. I quickly shook up the bottle and pour a smidge onto my plate for tasty... Oh yum! Nice spicy, vinegar-y, garlicky flavor. Most definitely pouring some of this on the chicken. The other hot sauce was ok.. nothing special. Habanero FTW!\n\nNext came out some cornbread with chili butter. Nice kick. Cornbread was a little dry.. but had a nice flavor. Then came the star of the show, a bucket of fried chicken! Loved the presentation. Came in a popcorn bucket that had the chicken AND popcorn. Oh yah! I love popcorn. My friend mentioned that the popcorn was amazing AFTER eating the chicken.. let the grease (I did say it was fried.. what did you expect?) soak into the popcorn. I quickly dug in and grabbed a leg and poured (carefully) the habanero hot sauce onto my plate. I took a bite of chicken to get the flavor before dipping into the hot sauce. I wanted to taste it in it's original form. Oh My Goodness. Juicy and flavorful. Everything fried chicken should be. Tasted just as great with the hot sauce. The real test was the white meat, and it blew my taste buds when it was just as juicy and tender as the dark meat. I was hooked. What turned out to be \"oh we can't eat the whole bucket.. blah blah blah\" ended up being a empty bucket of nothingness (oh, the popcorn afterwards was super tasty.. and dipped in the habanero hot sauce, even tastier). Because it was in our bellies! I can't comment on the sides since there was no room for that. I was too focused on chicken. My friend did say he loves the collard greens though. Should be good.\n\nWe also shared the bread pudding. That was good, too. So good that there was none left (again, most of my group did not want any.. but wasn't hard to convince once it arrived at our table).\n\nSo, my take on this place? Awesome chicken, great service, and relaxed decor and setting... what's there more to say?\n\nVerdict: Super Winnar!", "author": "Shauna Y."}

The decor feels kinda like I am eating in the living room in a house of young artists. It just has that gritty-artistic feel that the entire neighborhood seems to invoke. That is part of the allure.\n\nThe menu is original in that it is has traditional soul-food type dishes. Normally these types of dishes would not cost as much as they do at Front Porch, but I noticed care and attention in preparation as well as fresh ingredients. So call this upscale soul-food I guess?\n\nThe specialty of the house is for sure the Fried Chicken. I don't eat friend chicken on a regular basis - in fact, rarely. However, this is the place to order it. I've seen traditional Fried Chicken recipes and it is a complex dish to make - it's not done KFC style where you dump the chicken into a deep fryer and wait 5 mins. The dish is good to order as something for the whole table though, it could be much for one persona (especially since it comes with 2 sides). For sides - the mac/cheese is outstanding. There's been a renaissance for mac & cheese lately, and Front Porch's version ranks up there w/ the best of 'em.\n\nFor my meal I ordered the crab & grits. I was not thoroughly impressed, wish I ordered something else. My dining partner's however seemed to have great meals. Crab & Grits is just a tad too rich, and a tad too short on the crab.\n\nOverall a great dining experience with great traditional soul-food done fancy.

The first thing we noticed when walking in is the curtains that you have to walk through right behind the front door. Then the place looked like an old, dark as hell run down ghetto bar. I was surprised to see that allot of people were sitting down eating, and the more nicer tables where reserved. Speaking of the tables, if you like cramped listening to someone else's full on convo. while bumping elbows and there butts brushing up against your table when they walk by, then this is totally the place for you. Next was the  hard to read menus, i mean its already dark as is,but the menus being typed up by the worlds first typewriter wasn't doing it any justice at all, and being only one page made the experience even more gloomy. Lets talk about the service, before getting to our seat we waited at the door for almost five minutes before someone would seat us, on our pre-reserved table. Then the waiter brings us a 40 ounce bottle of there own bottled water that said on it \"Fucket buy a bucket\", how tacky is that! The drinks since we drove there we wanted to have a soda and they only had 3 types, coke, diet coke, and sprite. Dude wtf? The food, we had fried okra with the jalapeno sauce which was good, but the trouble came when we got our main dish. I had the 4-piece fried chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens with bacon for 18 dollars. He had spicy shrimp and grits bowl for 22 dollars. For such a high price we thought the food would be really good, but we were VERY WRONG! So the fried chicken was good it has nice seasoning and very well cooked, the collard greens tasted like CRAP,they were way over cooked, very greasy, and lacked flavor. My potatoes where good only up to the point where i FOUND A LARGE PIECE OF PAPER IN MY MOUTH, i showed the waiter the piece of paper sitting on my plate, and he at first reached towards my plate, about to pick the paper off with his bare hands. I had picked it up and gave it to him, only to hear him and the cooks saying, \" O WOW THERE WAS A PIECE OF PAPER IN THE MASHED POTATOES\", and the waiter returning asking me if i WANTED SOME MORE FREAKING MASHED POTATOES! what kind of SHIT is that? My fiance's food.... shrimp wasn't spicy the scallops were black and he thought they were mushrooms, and they were very over cooked, and tasted rubbery.

We ordered the red bean and rice as a starter (although typically a side dish).  Prior to our order they brought out sweet potato chips and cornbread.  The corn bread was just OK and came out lukewarm so it was nothing special (one of the few things as everything else was far above expectation).\n\nThe red beans and rice (we chose with pork) was fantastic.  It was just a little spicy with a slight sweetness from coconut and the pork was tender.\n\nMy wife had the spicy crab and grits which was also wonderful.  I had the jerk poussin with collard greens and turnips and cornbread stuffing.  I asked whether it was spicy and was told it was more sweet (bc of cinammon and cardamom).  I was a little disappointed as I really like spicy jerk chicken. \n\nHowever, I was surprised to find that it was sufficiently spicy (made my nose run slightly), but you could also taste the sweet spices - it is some of the best jerk chicken I've had since a recent trip to Belize...SO GOOD!  And the collard greens, turnips and cornbread stuffing were also EXCELLENT!\n\nWe would have loved to try dessert, but the two entrees and starters were very filling.  However, I'm very interested in trying the chocolate bread pudding on another visit to see if it is as good as my friend's mother's version - she's from Western South Carolina.

How can you have a triangular table and only use two sides for a party of 6?!  I guess its proximity to the bar did not allow for the hypotenuse to be inhabited, so we were all squeezed in to the booth areas on the sides.  Anyhow, that was about my only complaint, as every dish was really interesting and for the most part good to great.   The service was also perfectly chill and attentive at the same time.  Always a plus.\n\nHaving six folks there certainly afforded me the opportunity to try several dishes, including three of my own - the crab and mango salad, which was killer, the jerk flank steak and potato salad, again killer, and the de-constructed cherry jelly donut dessert, very cool but not quite killer.  I was told they do a mean jerk quail, and have a rotating offering in the jerk category.  This is grounds for serious excitement, as my jerk flank steak, though slightly underdone - more like bleu than medium rare - was one of the best meat/spice/texture combo's I've had in a while.\n\nI was also able to sample the conch fritters, which I would order again and was so sad to get only 3/4 of one, the fried chicken, which was moist and very flavorful, the salmon and plantains, which didn't really work for me (though I love both ingredients on their own!), the pork chop, which was solid, and the grass-fed burger (way to go) which was superb.  \n\nMost menu items come fried, or with something fried, so be prepared for this aspect.  For me that means comfort food, and along those lines I think that FP could just be the best around.  Add to it the creative Caribbean-esque twist and you've got a winner.  I'm actually itching to go back.\n\n4.5 stars, going on 5...  but I need a few more visits...", "author": "Pedro, aka Burgundy M."}

Music wasn't too loud, tables we're too close together, and everyone was in thier own conversations.  \n\nI was starved and went for the Fried Chicken, and my party went for the Crab and Grits. The chicken was large and we could have shared it. It had some coconut flavor that was foreign to me, yet satisfing. The mashed potatoes were sweet and creamy, just how I like them. My girlfriends Crab and grits had more grits than Crab an was low on flavor. \n\nWould I return? Yes. i would. My overall experience was good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-16", "description": "Although I've already written a yelp review for Front Porch, I feel compelled to update it, if only to rebut somebody's prior comments about the \"Porch Pork entree\".\n\nI was personally thrilled with the pork dish.  It's right out of a Caribbean market -- shredded pork (think carnitas) that was slow-roasted for over 4 hours, in a sweet dark sauce, with chunks of roasted plaintain and taro on the side.  They use the full pig, which means yes, you may get slices of pork belly (only we Americans seem to be afraid of tripe).  The plantain and taro offer a good starchy base to offset the rich pork and its sauce.  To provide a little extra flavor, the chef adds what appeared to be a pesto made from mint, garlic and some other ingredients I couldn't decipher.\n\nTo my boyfriend, who is the ultimate food critic -- and who is sure to make his opinion known when the \"flavors\" have not met his exceedingly high standards -- the pork entree passed with flying colors.  And for me, Mr. Frugal, I was more than pleased to have ordered the most expensive item on the menu.\n\nI'll agree that Front Porch can occasionally be a mixed bag (I had a pork chop entree last year that left me underwhelmed), but this place to me represents the best of what San Francisco has to offer.  The chef takes risks, keeps things fresh by updating the menu every season, and has unique items/dishes that are not easily found elsewhere.  Plus, the location and decor are the biggest highlights.  In LA, a restaurant of this caliber would be high-profile and posh; in San Francisco, it's tucked away in a basement next to the on-ramp for the Lower Mission Safeway.  It's exceedingly rare, and I'll concede cliched, to say that a restaurant can deliver a life-changing experience but somehow, Front Porch has achieved that impossible task -- and all the more remarkable that it's only a 3-block walk away from my front door.", "author": "Mervyn H."}

Love that they take reservations, but come early because parking is tough in that neighborhood!  We brought our 16 month old and 8 year old for a 6:00 Sat. night reservation.  They have a kids menu with all the stuff kids eat like fried shrimp and chicken tenders, and it's not the frozen stuff either.  It's made there.  Service was excellent, food was prompt.  We started with fried pickles and crawfish beignets which were good but nothing special.  My bf ordered the shrimp and grits which we both thought was excellent and would definitely recommend.  I ordered the saut\u00e9ed flounder which came with delicious baby carrots and liked it very much.  The bf indulged himself an awesome root beer float and I had an Irish coffee which was about 95% alcohol.

Literally sat outside on the front porch and enjoyed the beautiful weather and lively neighborhood ambiance.  Started with two delicious and fresh salads, (Arugala and watermelon and one other) both terrific, the jalapeno and bacon deviled eggs - delicious, and the fried green tomatoes (average).  The two standouts that will really have me coming back are the fried chicken and the brown bagged beignets.  I don't have much of reference point for fried chicken,  but this version is legit.  Hot, crispy, juicy inside, and tons of flavor.  The beignets were also nice and hot, covered in powdered sugar, and just the right size so you don't feel like a complete glutton.  One minor mishap, we ordered the coillard greens which frankly don't have much hope regardless of how they're prepared.  Service is solid, I dropped my knife once, and they brought before I could ask.

That makes me a sad panda. I overheard a waitress telling another table that their old chef was from Barbados (hence the Caribbean twist to the menu) and the new chef is from New Orleans. I'll be interested to see how the menu changes. Po boys and crawfish boils maybe?\n6 of us came to splurge on Mardi Gras with fried chicken and buttery mashed potatoes. It took a little while for our food to come out, but I suspect it's because they fry the chicken fresh to order. It came out piping hot, crispy and juicy. Each bucket contains 9 pieces of chicken and comes with a side of greens and mashed potatoes. We ordered 2 buckets to split between 5 people and left with enough leftovers for  2 or 3 meals. The only thing I wasn't terribly fond of was the sangria. Firstly, they don't do pitchers because each one is made to order. That doesn't really make sense to me because the best thing about sangria is the fruit that's been soaking up all that alcohol. Also, it's made with a rose and the only fruit is citrus, so it tastes more like a wine spritzer with grapefruit juice. It's not bad, it's just not exactly sangria.\nAs a super bonus though, Mitchell's Ice Cream is a block away. I think I might end up being a regular here. YUM!", "author": "Melanie V."}

My friend & I went on a Sunday night & it was packed...around 8pm. Almost a 45 min wait list but thankfully a small 2-top opened just in time & we didn't wait more than 10 min. Wished I could have sat outside on the front porch rocking chairs, but I'll save that for next time!\n\nThe food - here's my caveat...I spent 4.5 yrs in Charleston, SC. So I've eaten my share of Southern food - real Southern food. For a Southerner - you won't be overly impressed. For a person not from/not visited the Southeast, you'll like it. Here's my breakdown:\n\n-They were out of the house jug wine so we ended up w/ the Beajuloius (yes, I can't spell that!). Not bad & affordably-priced.\n-Fried Okra: yummy...we ate it all & it could have worked as a 4-person appetizer. The dipping sauce was OK, not sure what it was though\n-Fried Chix - how do they get it so dang moist but fried at the same time? For 1 serving you get a breast, leg & thigh. More than enough for 1 person. The \"bucket\" comes out in a large movie-style popcorn tub! Enough for 4-6ppl in my opinion. The crust had no flavor though - pretty sure it was only panko-style bread crumbs. If it was Southern it would have had spice. I had hushpuppies substituted for the garlic mashers (an extra $2. Seriously? For 3 hushpuppies?) NOT worth it...the hushpuppies have herbs in them instead of jalapeno or other Southern spices. The dipping sauce (which they forgot & we had to ask for) was bland but made the 'puppies better. The collards were good. \n-The sustainable fish (I think it was \"True Cod\" that night? Or something like that) was good but when it was put over rice in a brown-sauce w/ shrimp, the fish lost all flavor. The sauce didn't have too much taste but when combined w/ the shrimp & rice it tasted better. \n-pecan pie. Good but would have been better if I didn't have to force my knife thru the crust. Maybe they didn' t let it defrost enough when they took it out of the freezer? \n\nSplitting the bill, with tip ended up around $55-60 for the 2 of us. Lots of food though - portions are good sized. \n\nAmbiance was great - it's super cute inside & the wait-staff was knowledgeable. Our waitress seemed a bit aloof & we had to ask other staff for forgotten items but it was fun & overall worth it. I wouldn't take my Southern friends here but I'd take out-of-towners here for something a little different. \n\nThey position themselves as \"Southern\" but I'd call them more \"California Southern\".", "author": "Marissa H."}

My fried chicken was to die for - grits and black eyed peas were lovely.  I could have eaten two servings (I am a nursing mother - the servings were not particularly small, I don't think).  The other entrees (both the fish special - some sort of very overcooked looking swordfish over chickpeas that reportedly were flavored \"like baked beans\") elicited comments like, \"nice try, chef\" and \"i'm going to stop for a slice of pizza on the way home.\"  But the ceviche, cornbread (with yummy chile butter), and waldorf salad were all very solid to excellent.  Oh, and there was nothing I wanted on the dessert menu, which is both a rarity and a bit of a tragedy, but Mitchell's is, fortunately, just around the corner.\n\nSo, despite the very lackluster performance of the catch o' the day, I'm giving this place four stars.  They have valet stroller parking (!), it's loud (which sometimes drives me nuts, but sometimes I like it), the cocktail menu is interesting, and it's well-decorated.

The two of us were seated in the back of the restaurant right in front of the kitchen. About 3 minutes later, in walks a family of 6, 3 of whom are children under the age of  8. The hostess managed to seat that family right next to us and didn't offer to move us to one of the open booths or tables in the front of the restaurant. When we asked to move, they rolled their eyes, but obliged.\n\nLooking at the wine list, there was not a great selection under $40 and so we asked the waitress to bring us a bottle of her favorite red under $40. It was delicious, however when we received the check at the end of the meal, the wine had been $55. That was seriously sneaky. \n\nAs an appetizer we ordered the crab grits, and just like everyone says, they were DELICIOUS!

The burger was pretty much a burger, an above average one, but still, nothing special. The chicken however.... AWFUL! Absolutely god forsakenly AWFUL!!!! The fried skin tasted, literally, like cardboard. And my standards for chicken aren't that high so to do THIS bad, especially when everyone says how good it was, wow. So disappointed. The meat itself was nice and moist, so my boyfriend and I just pulled off the fried part, but come on, that's the whole point of fried chicken. Now, in all fairness to Front Porch, maybe that night something was wrong with their recipe. Maybe they ran out of some sort of spice. I definitely did here the table in front of us commenting on how strange the chicken tasted, and I heard the table next to us a little while later talking about how it had barely any taste either. So maybe I went on an off night.

Excited because I love Creole/Cajon food, and there is a dearth of it in San Francisco.\n\nArriving at Front Porch, you realize the name itself is kind of a misnomer. It's really more of an In Law, or maybe even a Garage. Those are far less appetizing monikers, so I can certainly understand the artistic licensed used. We were greeted by friendly enough people, who when informed there were six in the party, asked if we had reservations. We were told no reservations would be necessary, so it was a little odd to be asked, especially considering the restaurant was completely empty. Also, it should be noted, the entire staff was wearing fake mustaches - I saw this as a good thing. I can appreciate a fun atmosphere.\n\nI ordered the shrimp with grits, appetizer portion, and a side of macaroni and cheese. I found the portion a fair size - in fact, it didn't really look any smaller than the full plate one of my friends got. Sucks for her, I guess. The shrimp were cooked very well, the grits nice and creamy, with chunks of smoked bacon swimming among the flotsam.  All good. The problem was in the sauce, which was a reduction of shrimp stock. I love shrimp. Damn this was shrimpy. A completely unbalanced dish, lacking any kind of expert touch. But I really like shrimp, so I ate it just fine.\n\nMy macaroni and cheese was very, very average. I like creamy macaroni & cheese, not the dry and crumbly. But alas, macaroni and cheese is comfort food. The worst I ever had (as long as they don't screw around and put asparagus or artichokes in it) was perfectly edible. This is not a ringing endorsement.\n\nMy friends weren't so lucky. They all ordered full entrees.\n\nMy wife and another ordered the shrimp Po-Boy. It came with  sweet peppers and shoestring sweet potatoes. That sounds awesome. What they got got a section of baguette, with the middle hollowed out. Four or five pieces of shrimp inside with at most three (my friend got two) slices of pepper inside with them. This was drenched in a sauce that soaked the bottom of the bread, rendering it only edible by fork and knife. Po Boys are SANDWICHES! They are meant to be picked up and eaten. If you are going to force the customer to eat them with a fork, you need to make the bread soft enough so this isn't a pain in the ass. And the sandwich was buried under a mound of 25% burnt sweet potato fries. For around $15. BOO!\n\nAnother friend got the vegan option for the evening, the stuffed tomato. This was a very average size heirloom tomato filled with quinoa and baked. That's it. No sauce. Nothing with the quinoa. A fucking tomato with a cup of quinoa was supposed to be an entree. $15. \n\nThe final diner got the perloo. It kept getting referred to as jambalaya, but it was nothing of the sort. I assume it was supposed to be pilau, a spicy chicken and rice dish of African origin sometimes seen in the Southeast US. Jambalaya, on the other hand, should have something that crawls, something that flies, and something that swims to qualify it as such. Whatever it was, my friend had no major complaints, except that it wasn't \"really that great.\"\n\nSalads were also gotten. The girl that also ordered the tomato complained that she made a better salad for lunch. $8.\n\nWhen the group went their separate ways, almost immediately a round of texts and phone calls ensued, complaining about our meal. \n\nEach of the dishes we ordered were indefensible failures, both in concept and execution.\n\nIf you look for solid value, a lack of pretentiousness, and decent southern comfort food, look elsewhere.\n\nBy the way, I don't give bad reviews lightly - please see my other reviews.\n\nIf you're looking for another trendy place you can tell all your hipster friends was great, but don't actually care what the food is like, this just might be your joint.", "author": "Chuck N."}

I got tired of shouting \"What?\"  \"Huh?\"\n\n. . .\"Folks linin' up outside just to get down\" . . . \n\nIt was packed at Prime Time Saturday night. . .we placed our order and waited.  And waited.

The appetizers come in these huge negative space bowls. . .what that means is. . . HUGE bowl, small amount of food.  When you're packed five to this table it makes for some interesting juggling.   The fried chicken livers over brioche was the clear winner for the evening - and it filled with bowl.  The disparity between the sizes of the appetizers was weird. . .the chicken livers could have almost been a main course. . .my friend's Waldorf salad was teeny tiny (but delicious), my boyfriend's ceviche was all chips, very little ceviche (he kept asking me where the rest was), my collard greens with tomatoes and cornmeal ricotta fritters was truly delicious. .but again tiny amount in the negative space bowls. .. the fritters were incredibly good. . .but the tiny amount of greens was kind of a bummer.   The whole reason we were here was for the fried chicken . . .or at least that's why I was there.  We ordered a bucket for the table and it was fantastic.  The chef took something that everyone has a different recipe for and made it uniquely her own.  Quite wonderful - crispy, juicy and tender.  The sides were spicy and sweet Brussels sprouts which are some of the best I've ever had and grits that made you want to cry from happiness.   There was a glitch and one of the entrees we ordered came out almost ten minutes later than the rest of the food.  The front of the house guy (who I overheard telling someone was the chef's partner . . .these days it's unclear if that's strictly business partner or partner as in life partner) is the man. . . we were late and he handled that with aplomb and didn't make us feel like lepers and when our entree didn't arrive in a timely manner, he apologized profusely . . even though we weren't even really worried about it. . .whatever kind of partner he is, I hope they keep him around because he is great.\n\n. . . \"I can't hear you\"  . . .\n\nMy boyfriend leans over and puts his head on my shoulder. . .awww. .. how sweet. . then he shouts in my ear \"Rub my leg, honey, I've got a Charley horse and it's killing me!\"  As I reached down to rub his leg I noticed how stuffed into the booth he was but he wanted dessert. . . the dessert menu is VERY simple with just a couple of items.

Tucked into a side street next to Safeway, the restaurant seems very unassuming and almost more like a side bar you'd encounter on a stroll through the neighborhood. But the inside ambiance is great--it has a very comforting feel, low lights, music and mellow crowd sipping wine or beer. They keep their fare simple and have a limited bar (no fancies). No cappuccinos either folks, serving only plain coffee, but it is good, with flavors strong and nutty. they have delicious, home food style entrees like quail, catfish and po'boys, and sides like \"porch fries with spicy aioli \" and baked mac n' cheese. And they have delicious desserts... we had the chocolate chess cake with praline ice cream.

I'd recommend ordering the bucket for two if you're dining with a friend. My only qualm would be that it comes with garlic mashed potatoes and collared greens which were a bit underwhelming. The arugula salad was very tasty and a great appetizer to start since the chicken does take 25 minutes to make. (Worth the wait). I'd also recommend the burger, it was pretty damn tasty. The bun wasn't amazing, but the burger itself was yummy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-17", "description": "Overall, The Front Porch is a great dining experience. Quality food, decadent flavors, tasty libations and southern hospitality.\n\nCorn bread - awesome, moist, flavorful and a little spicy.\nRose sangria - interesting, fruity and served with a bendy straw. I felt like a kid and almost forgot I was drinking sangria.\nFried chicken - the chicken actually had flavor. Most fried chicken is only flavored on the outside, but this chicken was moist and the meat itself was flavorful. It was a little tangy, which I loved.\nBaked Mac & Cheese - rich, decadent and very good. I couldn't eat too much of it because it was very rich. \nVegan options - I know, I just raved about the fried chicken, so why would I complain about vegan options? I'm a part time vegan with a weakness for fried chicken. There, I said it. While they had a few vegan options, I think they could be more adventurous. There are many cajun/southern/soul food options that can made vegan. I make a mean vegan jambalaya. \nThey also gave us a little amus bouche before our dinner. It was a cream of broccolini soup topped with some Mexican cheese. It was delicious and a very nice touch to the meal. \nPriced well considering the quality of ingredients. It's not cheap, but I wouldn't say it was overpriced. Everything here is hearty and filling.\n\nThe ambiance was very comfortable and relaxed. You feel like your in someones house. Well technically you are. The Front Porch is basically a garage and basement of a house. \n\nThe decor is funky, quirky and soulful. The music fit the ambiance very well. I swear over the period of our dinner I heard some indie folk rock (think The Dirty Projectors) and even some Gucci Mane! Now that's my kind of place!!\n\nMy only two minor complaints are that they didn't have soy milk or a non dairy creamer for coffee. C'mon, you have a vegan plate but no soy milk. (I know someone reading this is saying: \"But you just ate fried chicken and mac & cheese!!\" True, but I prefer not to have cream in my coffee, but I did, and I'll probably suffer, but it was worth it) Also, they charged us $2.50 per person for cakeage.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-03", "description": "So to sum up right up front, Front Porch is too busy for its own good.  \n\nNow to start at the beginning: I had been looking forward to fried chicken all week as Front Porch was the Friday night plan for date night.  We arrived at 8pm prepared for good ole southern comfort food.  Now I am not a naive person -- I knew that we would have to wait.  And with King Cobra and their Sweet Tea and Basil cocktail, I thought my date and I were well equipped for the 30 minute wait we were given after putting our names down...\n\nAs it turns out, however, we were in for a good hour and a half wait before we would be seated.  The hostess was obviously overwhelmed by her list of names and people trying to pack inside (it was cold to be out on the porch) but such an inaccurate time table is pretty dangerous when you have hungry people awaiting.  I know things move slower in the South, and we would have been absolutely fine with an hour and a half wait if we knew to expect it.  You know, some mac & cheese at the bar, or maybe some fritters.  I mean we could have just eaten at the bar but when you think at any given point in time you could be called and sat, it just keeps you antsy.  And when we asked the hostess about the status on the wait, there were always two hypothetical groups in front of us, despite the fact that groups were being seated intermittently.  It looked as if she was seating groups of three or four who arrived after us at four-tops and keeping us on the wait list until a two-top opened.  Not a way to win diner's hearts.\n\nSo by 9:30 when we did finally get to sit, we got the corner table in back by the bathrooms and open kitchen.  It was cozy sitting next to each other on the old car style bench seats, and being able to see inside the kitchen gave us plenty to talk about.\n\nAs for the food, they were out of their fried okra -- one of the 4 vegetarian dishes the girlfriend was looking forward to.  The Yard Clippin' salad was a nice blend of sweet and savory.  We had the fritters that were great.  The fried chicken was good, but the mashed potatoes had the texture of the instant boxed type.  The kitchen was accommodating by making a side of their sweet potato fries that are generally only served with the po'boy. And by the end of it I was full but a little less than satisfied.\n\nThe food was good, but Farmer Brown is better.  The service was obnoxiously overwhelmed by a what sounds like a pretty medium sized crowd for the place. I was looking forward to Mitchell's ice cream afterward, but by the time we finally got out of there, that desire was killed.\n\nI would recommend a week night visit to the front porch -- I'd hope that the service would probably manage a little better on a Tuesday...", "author": "Alec D."}

I want to incorporate their ketchup into any and all future lovemaking, it's so delicious. If ketchup is your thing (it is SOOOOO my thing), you will love me for tipping you off to FP. I'm going to outline the Front Porch plan for you:\r\nOn your first trip, get the sangria while you're waiting for a table or while you're getting familiar with the brief, but widely varied menu. The sangria is pink (my fave color), tanngy, and velvety. It reminded me a little of pink lemonade. Order the sweet and spicy nuts, too (they're better than the ones at Solstice!). For your first trip, you MUST get the burger. It is some kind of super high quality cow, that you don't find in many SF restaurants (no! not kobe...something else...the bossman was telling my dining companion about it while I was getting pretty in the ladies'). Order it medium rare. Then order some red wine. That's all you- just make sure it's red. When your enormous burger comes (and bacon and cheese are included in the $11 pricetag), douse that sucker in the sexy sexy homemade spicy ketchup and dig in. But wait! There is a pile of potatoes that accompanies the burger...I swear they dust the potatoes with crack. Even Atkins couldn't keep me from wolfing those puppies down.  Douse those with ketch up too...more...more...that's right. The red wine brings the whole thing full circle and you will be too full for dessert. Order it anyway and start  your diet over again tomorrow.\r\nI actually considered stealing the jar of ketchup from our table but my friend convinced me to leave it by promising we'd go back next week.\r\n\r\nOther highlights: The pork chop made a pork-eater out of me and the heirloom tomato salad starter was all dressed up with pickled bits of veggies and a smooth, spicy mayo.  The crumbly cornbread comes with an addictive sweet-buttery-lardy spread that I opted to eat with my spoon...\r\n\r\nUPDATE! Couldn't resist the urge to go back last night. Seems like the reviews in the Chronicle and other publications have paid off. The place is hopping. We waited an hour and a half for a table for two, and never complained once. The friendly waitstaff remembered us and we enjoyed that addictive sangria and spicy champagne cocktails at the bar until a table opened up. You MUST try the ceviche! It comes with homemade chips that I couldn't resist dipping in that naughty, naughty ketchup. ALSO...made a salmon lover out of me, and I have never liked fish. The luscious cornbread was served piping hot and again, I ate ALL of the butter-sugar-pepper spread that came with it. The burgers are Uruguayan beef, same as the good Argentinean beef we can't get here, apparently. Get yourself over there! The food rocks, the crowd's cool, and the staff are refreshingly friendly and familliar.", "author": "Autumn K."}

So, last night, Maria D and I braved the sprinkle to pig out on the famed bucket of chicken.  I had in fact skipped lunch so as to hone my hunger to a fine point, so I was in good shape.\n\nSince we got there relatively early (~6:30), the wait was not so bad.  The owner himself took our names and told us that the wait would be short, around 20 minutes, and in fact came back once or twice to update us on our table.  It took a while to get our drinks at the bar, odd considering that the bartender only had wine and beer to pour and not much at that.  I quite liked the rose sangria, and I am not always the biggest rose fan (although I did miss the chunks of fruit in my jungle juice, but no biggie).  The bartender told us that we could eat there at the bar, and given how long it had taken just to get drinks from her, we were like, no thanks, little lady, which seemed to offend her a little.  This was an insight into the kind of dodgy server behavior tempered by the extreme niceness of the aforementioned owner that we would experience throughout the evening.\n\nWe got our table, and the owner set us up with a couple of wines in a box (think juice box, but with vino), and the waitress came to take our order.  We got the bucket of chicken with the fry trio and the collard green/black eyed peas/ham hocks as our two sides, and then decided that we'd also like an appetizer of the sweet and spiced nuts to snack on.  What followed was a bizarre conversation with our waitress:\n\nWaitress: Since you're getting the bucket of chicken, you might want something light for your appetizer, like the salmon ceviche.\n(some conference amongst ourselves)\nMe: No, I think we'd like to try the spiced nuts, they sound really good.\nWaitress: Yeah, but I think if you're getting the nuts and the chicken, that's too much.\nMe: Well, we're hungry girls.  Spiced nuts it is.\nWaitress: Would you also like to get the salmon ceviche?  It's really good.\nMe: Uh, no, I think that's a bit much.\nWaitress: Well, I mean, it's not like you're going to eat all the chicken.  You can take the leftovers home.\nMe: We'd like to try and eat it all.\nWaitress: Salmon ceviche?\nIn Unison: NO!  NUTS!\n\nAnd by the way, the nuts are fantastic.  And in a little bowl, definitely nothing that is going to fill one up significantly more than salmon ceviche.  The trio of fries, served with mayo, especially the sweet potato fries, were really yummy, as were the collard greens/b.e.p./ham hocks.  I don't know that the fried chicken is my favorite, but a) it's served in a bucket, b) it's still tasty, and c) the cold leftovers the next day were actually good (usually cold fried chicken is a pale and clammy imitation of its warmer cousins).  Our dessert was great, too - sweet potato and plaintain fritters in warm chocolate sauce.  Mmm.  The waitress made some weird vaguely snarky comment that we would see the dessert menu and then want our check and something else to the effect that she didn't really need to show us dessert menus in the first place.  We were there for a surprisingly long time and I think she was trying to hustle us out a little, but once again, sweet owner seemed in no hurry to make us leave.  I think if it were up to her she would have booted our spiced nut loving booties out the door a lot earlier.\n\nOdd service aside, I loved the experience.  Good food, great setting, and it was really nice to have a long, relaxing, delicious meal. \n\nUpdate: I am just going to keep updating this review, apparently, because every time I go here the service is a little different.  On my most recent visit, the wait was predictably long, but we actually got faster than normal service at the bar, and our waitress didn't avoid us per usual.  Happy day!", "author": "Tanya N."}

However, the food is a lot more delicious  than Mom could ever make (unless your Mom comes from the Caribbean, that is.) \nWe started with the heirloom tomato salad which was incredible.  I had the fried chicken and friends opted for the pork and beans and the oxtail stew.  I can't think of a single complaint about anything I tasted and I practically licked my plate.  To sooth the tummy, I of course asked the waiter if he could join me in a shot of Fernet.  He said that, lamentably, they did not serve Fernet (GASP!) but he had something even better called ....sssmsmslsosadd. Ummm ok, that wasn't the name of it, it actually started with a U and sounded German, but it came in Tabasco-like bottle and was all wrapped up fancy-like.  I don't think it topped Fernet for me, but the great intention was there.  \nThe evening ended perfectly as when I stepped out for a P-Funk.  The chef, Sarah, was there and I had the pleasure of sharing  some wine with her.  She is a talented chef and an intoxicating person.  Thanks for a great meal, Sarah.  I will definitely be back.", "author": "Jennifer s."}

It was the first hot day in SF and I celebrated with one too many brewskys if you know what I mean! The Front Porch was like a glistening oasis after dancing myself into starvation mode at El Rio. We pulled up to The Front Porch-on foot of course...and well, sat down on the front porch. A smiling host brought up our drinks and we swung back and forth on the porch swing. I had to stick with what I knew: the Poppy Jasper...I had been drinking it all day and I wasn't at a place to start making crazy decisions like switching my drink.  My friend got this crazy bio-infused cider that was made on a farm or something. The point is...it was delicious. In fact, I don't need to remember the name of it because we officially re-named it, \"delicious.\" Yep, that's the cider's new name. It was gone in about 10 minutes anyway, so I guess it doesn't matter. Did I mention they serve tall boys here? Yep. KING COBRA. If you ever got wasted as a young teenager, you know how spectacular it is to find King Cobra on a menu...they might have even had Old E...wow.\n\nThe food was awesome. I didnt' pause long enough to really enjoy it to the fullest though. I put a hurtin' on my fried chicken and collard greens. Yum. We started with the ceviche which was good, but I remember thinking it should have had more fish in it. My date had a pork chop and it was mmm-mmm good. We completed our drunken madness with a cake of some sort. I think it was birthday cake because it was really sweet and everyone around us seemed really happy....so maybe it was a birthday cake. Who knows.\n\nI live down the street from this place. I have been dying to try it. I have.

Guys, if you could blow yourselves, ladies, you'd be in this room alone right now... watching an empty stage.\"\n\nI didn't have a ton of friends in high school, and I was smart enough that I didn't really need to study, so I had a lot of free time. I ended up accomplishing a lot, by a certain standard: I learned to program in a few languages, wrote two short novels, recorded about an album's worth of music, and filled my bedroom walls with amateur landscapes. When I decided I wanted to do something, I would usually end up doing it, not so much because I was committed or industrious but because I just had so little else going on. So it only stands to reason that I did, at one point, put in the months and months of difficult stretching required to put that Bill Hicks quote to the test.\n\nIt was a long process. At first my efforts led to nothing, but as the lonely nights dragged on I saw some progress. I touched the tip of it with my tongue, briefly, and that was encouraging. Eventually I was even able to put my tongue on it for sustained periods of time, although the discomfort became would stop me from continuing further. I used a technique in which I would lay my head on a pillow, and roll up into a sort of ball, with my hips directly above my head, using one hand to compress my body further and the other to pull my target closer. It put a lot of stress on my neck and on my lower back, and my body would ache in the morning and sometimes through much of the day, but it was in that way that an athlete will find somehow satisfying.\n\nWhen the day finally arrived that I was able to actually get enough of it in my mouth and keep it there for long enough to make anything happen, I was somewhat disappointed. What Bill Hicks did not understand is that, for a straight man, autofellatio is a double-edged sword. It is true, you have the pleasure and arousal of having a mouth stimulate your penis; however, that arousal is countered by the rather unarousing sensation of having a penis in your mouth. All things considered it was neutral experience, on par with just sitting there. Certainly not worth the effort. However, I had made it that far, so I decided I may as well see the thing through to the end. I was a teenager so it did not take long. When I finally reached that point - well, the most comparable experience I have had since then is biting into a piece of okra in the Front Porch's vegan one pot stew. There was a lot of okra in there but the waitress let us trade down for fries and we didn't get charged for the stew. The fries were delicious, so that's cool.", "author": "Wayne W."}

All very delicious and well put together.\nTwo of us had the fried chicken, which comes in a little plastic basket, but you can get an order that serves 3-4 in a bucket. You can choose from sides but we both had the grits that are flavored with an excellent chili oil and fresh peppers on top, nice little kick.\nThe hamburger called for some of the homemade habanero chutney, which our friend didn't think was as ass kickin as the wait staff warned, but his palate can take some spice!\nLastly our friend had the dungeness crab porridge that was a nice medley of crab flavor atop creamy habanero grits. Not too spicy though.\nThe menu is written with a fun attitude, especially the wine list. We started with Prosecco and beers (but not the malt liquor!) then had a box, yes, a box of Pinot Grigio with the meal. The wines are all spectacular even though some may come in a juice box with a bendy straw or a jug.

I sincerely regret having to write this review, but after my most recent experience there, it's a must.  \n\nWe were HUGE fans of the restaurant.  Seriously!  The burger was the last real meal I chose to eat before going into the hospital to deliver my baby, and the first after she was born.  We loved it there, raving about it to all of our friends. Unfortunately, we looked like fools having talked it up only to be let down.\n\nIt's not the fact that it took an hour and a half to seat us, but what happened afterward.  Right from the start, it was bad. The normally delicious corn bread was much too spicy.  The baked oysters and shrimp were so-so.  But the most dissappointing part was my main course.  I opted to try the rabbit, thinking, if it's anywhere as good as their burgers and chicken, I'll be in heaven.  Instead the most expensive item on the menu was so dry I nearly choked.  No kidding. I had to leave the restaurant to get some air and clear my throat.  \n\nNeedless to say, I only finished the accompanying fixins, and hoped the sides would fill me up.  Oops, the waitress forgot to put in the order, so they arrived much later than the main courses AND were TERRIBLE. The sprouts, which are usually delicious, were undercooked, and the mac and cheese overcooked.  At the very least, the waitress could have comped them, but alas, they were on the bill.  UGH.  Finally, the waiter who cleared the table asked me if I was done with my fish. Fish? Well, even he couldn't believe a tender piece rabbit could be mangled so badly.\n\nA true bummer all the way around.  The worst part, however, is that our friends will probably not trust our restaurant selection again.  \n\nIt's going to take a lot of convincing to get me back to Front Porch.

I've lived very close to this restraunt pretty much my whole life. And I love fried chicken.............well anything fried is #1, 2, 3, 4,......83 on my favorites for food, so it was surprising that I haven't eaten here. So I was nice and hungover and in the mood for fried chicken. Its a nice little decor, a couple of tables outside with regular dining or possibly even rocking chairs to dine outside. On a nice day, it would be really great. Inside it seems almost like a bar inside, with 80s rock playing. I ordered the chicken n waffles, .....fried chicken and a nice waffle, can't go wrong with that. It takes over 20 min for the order to come out (which was stated on the menu to begin with)......but it was worth it. The waffle was nice, fluffy and with a nice slight crunch and a had a hint of cinnamon flavor. For me, it was a little too sweet for a main course but still good. But it was all about the fried chicken. I'm assuming the long wait was for the chicken and it seemed perfect. The skin was crisp with great flavor, without it feeling greasy and the meat inside was juicy. They also have a sauce, probably for the chicken, i thought it was a hot sauce, but it was more like a sweet chili sauce, a little more towards the chili side, but really, the chicken didn't need the sauce, it was that good. I would like to come back, they've got some other great sounding dishes I want to try, now I've been there, I'm probably going to be coming back more, I've broken the seal......good thing I don't live in SF or i'll have a heart attack from eating their delicious food all the time.", "author": "Matthew N."}

I'm a big fan of Emmy's and was happy to hear that the family is expanding.  The food however was an enormous let down.  My friend ordered a vegetable curry with coconut rice.  What arrived was something not in anyway resembling a veg curry.  Instead it was a dull plate of cooked squash over steamed white rice.  I decided to play it safe and order a cheeseburger.  I'd been craving one for a while and hoped that The Front Porch could satisfy the craving.  Let's just say I'm still craving that cheeseburger.  All in all we had a very poor meal.  I'm sad about this but I do plan to go back.  I know it sometimes takes time for restaurants to work out their kinks both in the front and back of the house.  For now, I'll stick to the bar and maybe a snack or two.", "author": "Anne D."}

We had the pickled veggies and fried okra for an appetizer, and they got a 3/5 star review.  Nicely seasoned, a touch too salty, but generally tasty.  For the main course we had the fried chicken bucket, and it got 1/5 stars.  The chicken was juicy and well cut, however it had NO flavor.  I've had better seasoned chicken at KFC, to be honest.  And that's just sad.   I gave a total of 2/5 stars because our waitress was nice, the water was refilled often and unobtrusively, and the setting was cozy.  However the price was too high for underwhelming food, we won't be going back.  \n\nSave your money for House of Soul in Vallejo.

I found it on yelp and it was open until 10 and close and off we went.  Parking isn't bad and the neighborhood is very nice.  The front porch of the front porch provides a great walking up experience.  The inside is a surprise it looks kinda seedy bar but instead of seedy it's trendy and decorated very intriguing in a good way.  The seating is great, we got a table that had half van seats which was very comfortable and we loved the use.  Coming from the south I have a pretty high standard for most comfort southern food and fried okra seems to be one that fails constantly when I try these type restaurants.  Well, we got the okra for an app and it was great.  I've had better but not much better.  The rest of the meal just kept giving.  I got the fried chicken which came with mashed potatoes and collard greens.  The greens were cooked perfectly which means they were tender yet had just the right amount of texture left, not mushy. The potatoes were great. The chicken was, like some other reviews state, probably the best I've had in SF.  I ordered a side of molasses coated brussel sprouts simply because I just had to try them.  They were some of the best sprouts I've had and even though the portion was huge we finished them because they were so good.  He got a burger and other than mistakenly ordering it more done than he wanted it was great as well.  Another thing that was good for me was the cask beer. It was my first beer from cask and although I normally like ice cold beer the flavor of the beer was great at room temp.  The service was super. I would say they understand southern hospitality.  Also the hot sauces are pretty amazing too.  I can't wait to go back and try more stuff.  If you like southern cajun style food and understand what it truly is then this place should be on your list.  It's great quality but feels so cozy so it just feels right. :-)", "author": "Rodney P."}

We were a 1/2 early arriving but they found us a table with no problem. The atmosphere is great and no one seemed to mind the different table configurations created to accommodate the different parties. The staff were all helpful, considerate and all very organized. The bar tender didn't just stand behind the bar but was also running drinks, bussing tables and helping in the restaurant. I read a few reviews about the prices, but the quality of food you get was worth it. From the cornbread, mussels to the deviled eggs to start the meal all the way to the thyme apple crunch pie to finish everything was awesome. The two entrees we ordered, shrimp/grits and the braised short ribs were delicious! We wanted to order the fried chicken and the Mac n cheese but couldn't eat anymore. Will definitely be back soon to work our way down the menu. Take the J train muni and walk 3 blocks so you don't have to sweat parking.", "author": "Michael K."}

But I can deal with all of this, as long as I have champagne.\n\nThe food was pretty good.  We had the fried oysters (the vanilla ketchup dipping sauce wasn't that great), so we dipped the oysters in this wonderful habenero hot sauce (the hot sauce ended up being doused all over the rest of our dishes).  The crab and grits was amazing (def was my fav of everything we had)....buttery goodness.  The surf and turf jerk was yummy but didn't knock my socks off...it could have been more jerk, if you know what I mean.  The pork chop and beans was very tasty.  I have to say that I just had a pork chop at NOPA which was brined as well, and sorry Front Porch, NOPA's chop kicked way more ass than yours, but your chop still tickled my tastebuds.  The plantains that came with the chop were not that impressive, but I have been spoiled with amazing plantains at this Jamaican restaurant in NYC that will prob forever rule in my book as far as plantains go, so Front Porch, you never had a chance on impressing me anyways.

That unknown extra thing that really makes an amazing dining experience. As Carla on Top Chef would say, it shows you the love.\nIt's got a seriously cool vibe, no studied decor, no trendy of the minute abstract art, no snooty bitch hostess, it just feels like you walked into some backwater Southern kind of restaurant that is a mish mash of oil cloth, Bob Marley, dim lighting and just plain cool. I know I've already used cool a lot to describe this place but it's just so damn cool! I frickin love this place. For example, the whole time we sat there, every song that came on was awesome! And you could actually hear the music and converse with your partner. That's like five stars in and of itself.\nNow for the food, oh honey, this is no time for Weight Watchers and counting calories, it's time to just dig in and grub because this is some serious deliciousness. And fair warning, some part of your meal will most likely be fried. They bring you out yummy corn bread (shaped like corn! How.... corny!) and to start we shared the oyster beignets. These are SO good! The beignet is at the bottom and is dense and doesn't actually taste all that fried and has a mild sweet flavor and then on top a savory, succulent, briny fried oyster that just tastes like the perfect bite of ocean and fried goodness. It was an amazing combination. My husband doesn't even like oysters and he enjoyed it so much he ate his full share of the appetizer. Which was kind of a bummer cause that meant less for me. Marriage sucks!\nI then had the shrimp and grits and these were amazing as well. My grits were creamy and cheesy served with greens, bacon and mushroom and the shrimp were succulent and sweet and flavorful. I really enjoyed this dish. \nI highly recommend this place for dinner for groups of two to four, the food was good but really it was the restaurant itself that elevated everything to this whole other level. It wasn't fancy pants and it just didn't care which made it oh so cool. I plan on spending a lot more time here.", "author": "Cathy T."}

There were six of us - we ordered some fried chicken, chicken fried steak, the rock cod, and the po boy.  There was fried Okra, french fries, and the pickle jar for all to share.  \n\nThe service was unremarkable. When asking the waitress about the contents of the pickle jar she said, that's a good question and then went on to say that it was seasonal, but didn't check it out.  Beyond that she was pretty attentive.  \n\nMost of the food was a hit.  The po boy missed the mark. Far too bready and too much mayo on the slaw.  Plus, the aoli for the sweet potato fries was pretty bland.  The plate was too small for the abundance of fries and bread.  \n\nThe rock cod was probably the star of the meal.  Pecan encrusted served over black eyed-peas and collard greens.  Excellent flavors and the fish was cooked perfectly.  \n\nGood reviews for the chicken fried steak and gravy too.  The right about of seasoning - you could taste the pepper in the gravy, which really brought it home.  \n\nThe chicken was better the way the former chef prepared it, but still worth the calories.  \n\nDessert was a bust.  Bananas Foster Creme brulee -- bland and a funny texture.  \n\nRed Velvet Cake - cake was a tad dry  - the frosting was good. \n\nThe place is hipster with a family vibe.  A little dark so some trouble in reading the menu.  Some Mexican guys were playing loud music at the open and close of the meal and walked around with a tip jar. I get supporting the community, but felt it was out of place.\n\nDefinitely will go back and stick with the rock cod and give the salt cod fritter a whirl next time.\n\nOh, and we were able to make a last minute reservation so that was cool too.", "author": "Carson R."}

I took the 6:45 considering our post dinner plans. Traffic was really bad and I called to let the host know we would be late. He was so nice and accommodating, saying he'd give us an extra 15 min even though it was a busy night. Parking was also exceptionally bad and I had my bf drop me off while he circled the block. They seated me no problem, even though we weren't both present. Our waiter was extremely friendly and brought drinks asap. My boyfriend joined me 10 min later and was ecstatic to be greeted with a Sazerac and warm, humble service. We decided to order gumbo, baked mac and cheese, and we split the flounder entr\u00e9e. We had to laugh at the 2 infant muffins that were brought to the table, but I knew I didn't really want to fill up on those anyway. Everything we ordered was incredible. The gumbo came out piping hot and was spicy and hearty. The mac and cheese..words fail me. Absolutely heart stopping delicious. And the flounder was surprisingly delicious considering it wasn't something I'd typically order (I opted for the fried chicken but relented to trading for my choice of sides:) and was served over jambalaya. We ordered another round of drinks and the bill was surprisingly $64. And did I mention how effing cute this place is? Seriously, such a great dining experience.

Yes! CLOSED! It was, after all, a Sunday night, but c'mon-- us comfort-foodies need to eat too. \nAnd while I continue to love The Blue Plate, I must say I was rather happy to have had the forced experience of venturing into a new and yet personally unchartered territory....The Front Porch. \nThe place was like an oasis, lit up with strung lights and visions of a rocking chair out front-- especially on this brisk night with hunger calling, the wind blowing, and following a day of loading and unloading a rented U-haul. (And dinner was on Henry..Cheap eats! Even better!)\nWhen we entered inside, it was like walking into a time warp. The place was filled to capacity and mellow, a friendly vibe, especially as we slunkered up to the bar and were greeted by the bartender du jour. He offered a few pourings of vino before we decided on a bottle, and was generous in this task. He also had opinions of what was offered on the menu and guided our decision making task with gentle persuasion. We opted for the fried chicken and mash, fried okra, and a corn grits and crab app. First, crab and grits go well together. Really well together. This dish didn't last long. Cornmeal crusted fried chicken was also a real hit, served on a bed of leek mashed potatoes with half an ear of corn. The fried okra was good, but I don't know that I'll give it a second time around. Not by any fault of the okra, mind you, but more likely the result of fried-food-overkill following the fried chicken. These crispy little nuggets were also a tad hard to eat and part of me thought that whole okra pieces might fare better, go down a little easier, or at least pick up better. Tasty, but not to die for. Again, would probably fare better if not eaten tandem with fried chicken. \nThe desert menu looked fantastic..(upside down pineapple cake anyone?) But seeing as how another local favorite, also within walking distance and looming just around the corner, we high-tailed it out of there and nabbed our spot in the year-round line out the door at Michell's. \nI'll definitely make it back to The Front Porch again soon....and this next time, I'm ordering the pineapple upside down a la mode!", "author": "collette h."}

It was very cozy yet felt very homey....it was sort of like visiting a relatives house somewhere in the south, which is most likely their intent and they pulled it off very well.  The place was packed and filled with energy in the tight fit room. We had a big table for our party so we did not experience any of the proximity issues that i am curious about on this visit. Everyone appeared comfortable and happy though, at least from afar as best as I could tell.  It is very different than a lot of the other places I tend to frequent, but oddly enough I really like the place.  The food was okay.  I like some items more than others, but over all the food was good.  I really like the shrimp and grits, that was probably the most memorable.  The fried chicken was lacking some flavor and not as crispy as I would have expected.  My grandmother was from the south and I was expecting some of those more zesty flavors I grew up with.  The Key lime pie, the Pecan pie and the strawberry shortcake were all delicious.  I don't personally like bread pudding, but everyone in my party seemed to like it a lot, so i will relay their experience for that item and say that it is a hit also.

I'm in the area a lot, love Emmy's, and Blue Plate down the street will always have a warm place in my heart. I've come here numerous times over the years it has been open, so I feel I've had enough experiences and food to weigh in. It's just that the food is so lackluster these days--and pricey for what you get--that it's glory days (if you can call them that) are gone. The food has never been particularly memorable-- fried chicken in a bucket is good, but not so tasty that I left really happy and licking my fingers. The brussel sprouts in molasses sound great, but aren't flavored with anything aside from the syrup, apparently (a little salt, sugar, and bacon would go a long way). The gumbo and grits are ok, but not great. That sums up about all the food on the menu--gets the job done, but not enough flavor to be memorable or warrant the (usually) $17-20 price point. And definitely lacking in comparison to true southern cooking. The menu has gone downhill over the years in my opinion-- in part I imagine due to the original executive chef moving on--and the prices have gone up. No more free jalapeno cornbread-- that'll cost you $4.

Since it was 5:30 on a Sunday, I thought \"maybe we can actually get into Front Porch without waiting 45 minutes!\" And, yes, in fact, we just walked right in. (By 7:00 there was one table left, and by 7:30, the hostess had started taking names.) (And no, we are not senior citizens looking for the early bird special. We'd been out running errands all day; we'd skipped lunch and we really needed to tie one on.) \n\n5-stars for the drinks. Interesting, strong, and something for everyone.

I noticed that the bar was packed even when there were tables still left in the restaurant, so obviously, I'm not the only one who would come back here just for a drink. \n\n5-stars for the service. The chef let the bf into the kitchen to inspect her jars of pickled stuff and then brought the pickled egg & veggie appetizer to the table herself. (I know, you're thinking \"gross\", which is what I was thinking, but it actually wasn't bad. I didn't try the egg though. That thing just looked disgusting.) The waitstaff was attentive without being pushy.They were particularly good with anticipating almost-empty glasses, and any place that does not expect me to sit still without a glass of alcohol in my hand will always get a decent review.  Love the decor - intimate without being too loud. (Of course \"intimate\" means small, which is why you usually have to wait an hour to get a table.) \n\n4-stars for the food. Big bonus that you can actually get veggie and vegan stuff at a soul food place. The food is flavorful, but I was expecting a little more spice in my vegan stew.

I love the ambiance...the bar/small dark diner feel and of course the food.  \nHere is what i have had so far: The FRESH Peach Bellini, the wonderful hot bread/cornbread at dinner with spicy honey butter, fish and chips, hamburger and fries, grits porridge (mmm), Black eyed peas (yuuuuummm), ceviche with plantain chips, coleslaw, chicken livers with onions on brioche (super loved  this) , corn on the cob,and the (omg so delicious and so my favorite of all ) fried chicken.  I especially loved the housemade ketchup and the hot sauce too.   Everything has been consistently great, even on the busy night i was there. The service has always been very attentive, and Kevin who was at the bar (my favorite place to eat) was so so nice and welcoming.  \nFront Porch really DOES rock...I cannot wait for the BBQ.", "author": "sarah C."}

However, the crowds may vary and it can be real loud inside. I came around 8.30 pm and finished around almost 10.00 pm. It was almost the closing time and thank god the atmosphere has toned down. The food, i must say i did not expect. They gave us an appetizer bread with some sort of butter based sauce and it was AMAZING. The bread is warm, soft, sweet and light. It was simply exquisite. We ordered the beet salad, chicken gumbo, fried chicken bucket and the crab fitters. All of them were really good. The chicken bucket is well done, although i did still see some blood in the chicken, which was quite scary so i ended up only the part that is cooked. It was juicy and tender...loved it! The fritters and gumbo were really good too! It was creamy and crunchy at the same time(fritters). However, i do suggest that when you ordered the gumbo, you order extra potatoes or rice. It just taste better then. Overall, really satisfied here. Note: Better make a reservation call if you dont want to wait 30 minutes!", "author": "Cavin T."}

His directions were 28th Street off of Mission but we discovered 28th doesn't really hit Mission.  A quick phone call, a Google search and a \"oh it's one block south... or is it north?... of Safeway\" later, got us to 29th Street.  (No mean feat, as slander, not geography, has always been my strong point).  The place normally doesn't take reservations, except for special occasions (like Valentine's Day), and we had none. But it was early-ish, we waited a few minutes and were seated at the table near the window --- and front door.  As we were seated, the host told us of how they found a photograph from the early 60s which featured 2 old women dressed to the nines, drinking beers, sitting at that very same table looking out that very same window.  (\"Did he just compare us to a couple of old spinsters?\" asked my friend).\n\n     It was a fixed-price meal, appetizer, entree and dessert for $35 including a saucer of champagne --- as opposed to a flute, which is appropriate considering its days-of-past decor.  The salad was great --- molasses and mustard dressing, the chicken was fab and the 2 desserts were phenomenal.\n\n     The only thing preventing a full five star review is the cigar smoke waffling in the door from the gray, pasty-faced smokers outside, and the fact that it did become very crowded, and, as our table was near the door, we were surrounded by a crowd --- bumping our chairs-  as they waited to be seated.", "author": "Cary Y."}

The Front Porch really is a great place to enjoy some delicious food and drinks. The dinning room vibe really is unique, though a little bit on the dark side, and I really can't imagine anything a block south of Mission Street could be more relaxing than enjoying a beer, gliding on a rocking chair out on the front porch. \n\nBut, in all honesty, this place is not for the weak of heart or uninitiated... \n\nTo begin with, there appears to be some confusion regarding the reservation policy. According to the Yelp page, they do accept reservations. However, when we called, we were told that they don't take reservations, but did have a wait list. Then, once we were there and on the wait list, we over heard two people mention that they did have a reservation! But, we had plenty of time to consider this reservation paradox as we waited a heart-staggering hour and fifteen minutes! The hostess did her best to placate us all, but at that point she was getting nearly mobbed every time she called anyone's name. To make matters slightly worse, she kept calling our party by different names - first we were Larry, party of 2...and then we morphed into Tom, party of 2...I'm not even sure she remembered our name, (Eric, party of 2) when she seated us. But, it's hard to blame someone dealing with forty hungry people and her only weapon is a tiny clipboard and pen.\n\nOnce we finally had the chance to sit down and order, we sampled and smacked our way across the delicious menu. Out of all of the things we tried, we enjoyed the Louisianan frog legs the best. They were unique but simply prepared and the perfect snacking size, though a bit on the expensive side ($11). The fried okra ($5) we also had was tasty and basic and that \"jalapeno lime aioli\" was totally ranch dressing. While probably very traditional and certainly yummy, it was a bit insulting not to have that described on the menu.\n\nI was excited to see a vegan special plate ($15) on the menu, but disappointed that the amazingly wonderful sweet potato pancakes and black eyed peas were accompanied by some burnt kale and undercooked leeks. While I'm not a vegan proper, I do love me some veggies and these were just not good veggies. The good lookin' guy with me, had the rabbit special ($20) and was likewise disappointed that there was way more sausage than rabbit in the dish. We didn't stay for dessert, but we'll probably still give this place another chance. \n\nThe Tiffany Scale:\nImpact on Wallet: 3 of 5                       Impact on Soul: 4 of 5\nImpact on Stomach: 4 of 5                  Overall: 11 of 15", "author": "Tiffany S."}

Although I had a good time there and thought that the prices were very reasonable, I can't say that I was blown away by the food. In fact, some of the dishes didn't work at all, whereas others were more successful. The bomb of the night was appetizer, I believe it was called something along the lines of southern greens with tomatoes and ricotta fritters. A fritter should be light, airy puffs of fried batter and hopefully include some kind of goody inside. The consensus at our table was that our fritters were ill conceived and leaden. They were dusted with powdered sugar which not only didn't complement the savory tomato sauce they sat in but actually clashed with it. Blah. \n\nMoving on, I will say that they have cheap booze which can be a blessing if you want to go out and have one of those nights. My \"deuce\" of Three Thieves pinot was easy drinking and $10, which was fine with me. \n\nWe opted to order the fried chicken plate, the burger, and an order of crab grits with the idea that we would share everything. The buttery crab grits were the clear winner of the evening although the habanero and scallions appeared to be absent. No worry though, it was a tasty dish and a good value for $11.50. The burger was a tough call. The accouterments were all top notch, good pickles, a tangy, sweet home-made ketchup heavy on celery salt, and amazingly tasty bacon cooked just right. Unfortunately the patty itself was less than stellar. I knew that we should have ordered it rare, but my compatriots insisted on medium rare. Although there was a hint of pink in the center, the patty was a little dry and crumbly, not a top notch juicy burger. A small frown graced my face as I sampled the vaunted fried chicken. Perhaps you know that I make an effort to get out in the world to eat as many versions of fried poultry as one girl can. The F.P.'s version  will not be at the top of the list. It tried hard with the pepper in the batter (which I love) but appeared to be over fried as the crispy coating was quite dark. It came with sides of black-eyed peas which were also rated as merely okay and some more creamy grits. \n\nService was on the spacey side and didn't seem particularly bright or polished. All were pleasant and they've done a lot with the space. I was really hoping for a more solid performance though. I'm sure I'll go back from time to time to get some grits but I hope they improve the fried chicken.", "author": "Candice L."}

I rallied the troops and booked a table. Apparently, they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more. Perfect. We were 5. \r\nLate in the afternoon, Big Chris called saying, and I'm paraphrasing here, something better came up. \r\nShit. He was our 5th. \r\nNext, my brother Alex called.\r\n\"I'm still at work.\"\r\n\"It's Saturday! Leave!\"\r\n\"Do not give me shit, Beth. I am pissed enough already.\"\r\nFair enough. I called the Front Porch. \r\n\"Hi, I had 8:15 reservations for 5 but we've sadly dwindled to 3 and I know you don't take reservations for less than 5. I thought I should call.\"\r\n\"You're Beth? That's cool that you called. Thank you. Are you still planning on coming? Okay. I'm taking you off the list, but introduce yourself when you arrive and I'll do my best to seat you quickly.\"\r\nMarvelous. Laura, Mike and I headed over early and grabbed drinks at the 3300 Club (now open at 8am on weekends!) for some pre-dinner drinks. I urge you to read the reviews of the 3300 Club because I'm sure I can't do it justice. Basically, the jist of the place is old alcoholics drowning their sorrows. If I have learned one thing since puberty, it is that the demographic which finds me most attractive is old alcoholics drowning their sorrows. As Laura predicted, I was a hit in the 3300 Club and one particular gentleman took quite a shine to me. So drunk was he, I couldn't understand a word out of his mouth. Not a word. Literally. \r\nI smiled. I nodded. \r\nWe headed over to The Packed Front Porch and I checked in. \r\n\"Oh, so you're Beth.\"\r\n\"Uh, yeah. I'm, uh, Beth.\"\r\n\"Okay, cool. It'll be a little bit. But I'll find you.\"\r\nI looked around the small, DARK space and noted the crowd. \r\nHeavy on the hipsters. \r\nI looked around the wine menu. \r\nHeavy on the Jugs. \r\nI bought a $15 jug of Pinot Noir and found my friends on a bench outside. We waited and snacked on $2 picked eggs and veggies. It wasn't that bad. We took cheesy pictures of us on a sidewalk holding the jug. \r\nPictures?\r\nCome on! We were on a sidewalk. Holding jugs of wine! Whatever...\r\nFinally seated, we ordered the wonderful tomato salad and another jug. Let me tell you something, Yelpers. I said NO to the second jug. A jug, it seems, is way more than a bottle and the last thing these particular three people needed was more booze. Alas, I was outnumbered. \r\nWe then ordered the obvious: a bucket of fried chicken. \r\nYou get two sides with the chicken and we selected the corn and the cole slaw. \r\nThe corn? Eh. It was dry and on the cob. \r\nThe slaw? Eh. Not good. Not bad. \r\nThe chicken? Okay, okay. I give in. It was good. It was good in a way that probably took a year off my life. The chicken must be dipped in some batter with cornmeal in it before it's deep, deep fried, and it's crunchy and oily and moist and glorious. \r\nAlex showed up, finally done with work. \r\nSo we ordered cake. You've got to love a place that offers yellow cake with chocolate frosting on the dessert menu. I'm ghetto fabulous. I had to have it. \r\nBut once it arrived, my beloved friends were so trashed on their jugs of wine and buckets of chicken that they ceased to be fun. \"Pay the bill!\" I screamed. \"I need to go home. You bitches made me full and tired and drunk and I can't move.\" \r\nThe car barely screeched to a halt before I was shoved out of the vehicle. Off they went to the Beauty Bar and off I went to bed, drunk, full and sick of these freaks I call my in-crowd. \r\nBut the Front Porch? Well, they have $2 pickeled food. So, uh...nuff said.", "author": "Beth S."}

The beans are ok, but I'm not really a bean person, and the dirty rice is great.. I even find myself craving it from time to time ;) The best thing about this place is their ketchup!

Seriously best service ever!\nDelectable food-my friend and I split Ellie's fried chicken which is 3 pieces (all white!) with mashed potatoes and corn on the cob.  We also got the fried okra and the coleslaw (the best coleslaw that has every crossed my lips!).  We were completely stuffed and even had to take a piece of chicken home.  Total of the bill was around $29 with tax.  They even brought out a spoonful (the wonton kind) full of  gazpacho, compliments of the chef.  Love it!\nThe only downside was-no full bar, wine and beer only.  I got a cocktail made with fresh peaches and mosacto di asti.  While good, not worth $7.

Similar to Blue Plate around the corner in food style, but its interior provides for a little more \"edge\".  Looking for a good crowd and comfort food in the Mission, give The Front Porch some serious consideration. \n\n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n\nAmbiance/Atmosphere: 3.5 stars.  Think dive bar feel, cushy booths, alternative fun young crowd.  I would have thought it would be hard for someone to make a dive-like diner cool, but the folks at Front Porch have done it.  The restaurant can get a little noisy as the long line of patrons waiting for a table huddle around the bar and slowly start consuming portions of the dining area.  I thought this provided a good jive, but if you are looking for more quiet time I could see how this could be an annoyance.  There is also a little porch out in front (hence the name) where you can chill, and I believe there could be food service out there, but not sure??  Advice, try to get a seat in the back portion of the dining room.\n\nService: 3.5 stars.  I found the service staff at the Front Porch delightful.  They were helpful with the menu and provided some value added insights into the dishes.  I think the level of service could be only better for a place like this if they could provide you with a tiny bit more of attention.     The problem was that 2 or 3 waitresses were trying to cover too much ground.  Although they did a really solid job, it was just impossible for them to really get involved in the dining experience.  Overall though everyone was super cool, and provided good insights into the food and beverage.  I was pleasantly surprised.\n\nFood: 3.5 stars.  We started with a sashimi type dish, which consisted of Hamachi.  This seemed very out of place for their style of comfort food menu, but we were looking to start off with something really light.  It was tasty, and the fish was of very high quality and the cut was good.  I would expect something of this caliber in a higher end sushi joint.  Next we moved onto the pork chop and skate for our two entrees.  Both were very, very good.  The skate was a bit salty, but they made up for it with preparation.  I think Skate is one of the toughest fishes to cook well, and I was surprised of how good a job they did with it.  One less pinch of salt and they have a huge winner.  The pork chop was excellent; tender and juicy.  My only compliant is that this dish I find is getting a little overdone, so it didn't stand out so much for me.  We ordered a side of brussel sprouts (yes I like them), which if you are a fan you have to order them.  The best I have ever had.  We skipped the desert, because we were so full.  \n\nWine: 3 stars.   I have to say this was one of the more surprising aspects of the meal for me.  I was expecting  a horrible wine selection.  They have put together a nice little list that really has something to offer for everyone.  The other thing I like about the list is that you can order a lot of wines in 500ml size.  We ordered a Spanish white and a French Burgundy, both in the 500ml size.  Both were very good, and matched pretty well with the food we ordered.  Our waitress also had a good grasp on the list, which at a lot of places recently has been absent.  I think it would be interesting for them to shift their list to more of a domestic orientation, matching American comfort food with American Comfort wines.  All and all though, really well done.  They also have a great beer selection, but no cocktails.\n\nOverall: 3.5 stars.  Well done!!! A really fun night out.  We went here on a Wednesday night and the place was hopping.  Be prepared for a bit of a wait if you arrive past 7pm, especially on Fri and Sat night.", "author": "Scott P."}

I do like the food,  they have a nice drink selection, the place is cute and it's a fun enviornment.  The service can be a  little dodgy, but I understand how that can happen on a weekend night in a busy place like this.  However, last weekend a group of us (4 people) waited an hour and 20 mins., 45 mins longer than their estimate.  We could have dealt if we saw that the end was near, but the host pretty much ignored us and it really appeared like she could care less if we stayed or left. So we left and got thai food down the street.  My 3 stars is an average of 4 stars during the week and 2 stars on the weekend.", "author": "JB S."}

Can I be witty?  Can I be insightful?  Can I spell correctly?  Do I have a song I can sing?\n\nYou also wonder how, when you were once young and hip, had never heard of a restaurant that 231 people have reviewed in Yelp.  We went with a friend who read the review in Patricia Untermann's newsletter.  \n\nThe review:\n* I had some nice fried chicken.  Tangy (Terri says too tangy), moist, well salted, well fried (but the breading comes off the chicken too easily).  We got the bucket but we didn't get any thigh pieces, which was a disappointment.  The bucket was a good presentation vehicle BUT - the pieces of chicken at the bottom of the pile got soggy.  Secondly, the bucket also made it difficult to see the side dishes on the other side of the bucket.\n* The mango/crab salad was nice - the habanero gave it a nice sustained heat while both the mango and crab's sweetness still came through.  Very well done.\n* Potato salad was hyped extensively by the waitress but it's probably something the Yelp population can whip up themselves any given night.\n* Sauteed Greens was good - garlicky, slightly too oily\n* the dessert special was a beignet made with petit choux with a mascerated strawberry sauce and sweet cream.  The beignet + hot choco in Andalu is much better\n\nThe big pluses were the prices (reviewed ad nauseum by other reviewers) and the service.  Our waitress Pam was engaging, smart, obvioulsy liked the food (not surprising), and attentive.  \n\nHowever, it's sad when we rave about restaurants who serve a bucket of fried chicken for $30 bucks as a GREAT DEAL.  It's sad to rave about service when, quite frankly, the place had people who kinda cared and liked the food.  Are we really that desensitized by the crappy high priced food and snobby attitude?\n\nThis is not to dis Front Porch at all - God bless for them for creating a lovely restaurant with excellent food, reasonable price, - I'll come back for sure.  BUT, if you are reading this 232nd review on your restaurant... we'd love a bucket of chicken for $20 (very happy to pay $20 for non-organic chicken).", "author": "Hanson L."}

I am a Southerner, and naturally a bit skeptical every time i see a Southern restaurant out West. But oh my god this place blew me away. Kudos to The Front Porch for offering a vegan plate that holds its own against the more typical meaty dishes so popular in the South. As a vegetarian, I usually have to deal with the boring, flavorless \"4 veggie plate\" at most restaurants. But this vegan plate was just fantastic in every way - delicious, inventive, unique. I ordered way too much and way overate just so i could try a lot of the dishes. Favorites: Biscuits, mac and cheese, okra and my perfect vegan plate. The people will me loved the gumbo and the fry daddy bowl, which had a ton of random fried stuff mixed together. Only negative: No cocktails. I could see this place coming up with some really interesting cocktails. Maybe someday :)", "author": "Erin R."}

Last night was gorgeous so we were pretty excited about being able to relax on a rocking chair - we got the electric marmalade (mmm fruity and flowery tasting sweetness) and the Lana Lee tea (tea with basil and congac-y sweet liquor). \n\nAfter our drinks we headed in - the cornbread was delicious, but small and not replenished. The fried green tomatoes with which we ordered becasue they were a larger portion than the crab (said our very friendly waitress) were ok.. lots of fried, some shrimp, a pretty strong cream sauce - three slices of tomato and three shirmp. \n\nEntrees were the seafood perloo (black cod was the featured fish) - I had a bite.. the sauce was a bouliubaisse-y and the fried chicken. The fried chicken was a drumstick, wing, and some other white meaty piece  - chicken was super juicy and crispy and tasty. The mashed potatoes tasted more like cream, and less like potatoes, the beans were meh. The food was good, but was it worth 19 bucks? Ive had some gourmet mashed potatoes and fried chicken in atlanta - and those potatoes were amazing, came with more sides, and the entire portion was larger. Dont get me wrong, the chicken portion was pretty big (the seafood not big enough and we got some plaintains - but they were a little bland)\n\nAll in all - \n\natmosphere inside and outside - casual, cozy, fabulous\nservice - friendly\nfood - ok, not good enough for the price.

First, while you're waiting for your table you should get a Duval beer with some hot and sweet nuts!  They're awesome.  They're coated in powdered sugar and cayenne pepper.  You have to try them.  \nNow, I believe they take reservations if you can actually get through.  And if you have a party of more than 4 I think this would be a good idea.  We waited for two hours!  They were very nice about it and luckily we didn't have anywhere else to be so weren't in a huge hurry.  This is also why I enjoyed those nuts so much. \nOnce you finally get your table you have to get the fried chicken and the dungeness crab grits.  I'm not kidding, those grits are freakin amazing!  DO NOT miss out on them!  \nThe price is amazing too!  I think it was something like $20 per person at a table of 6 people.  And we were all full!  I love this place.

Being a lover of New Orleans cuisine I ordered the staples - some gumbo and some red beans and rice. The gumbo was really thick and heavily seasoned, no flavor from the ingredients make it through the mess. Barely detected the one oyster I could recognize. As it cooled to lukewarm it was honestly inedible. Nobody at the table wanted it, we made it through about half of it. I would guess they spilled the spice jar into the red beans. They were just a total disaster, even while still warm. Noticeable powdery taste, and (EEEK!) even a little undercooked! We didn't even eat a third of it. No amount of rice could bury the weird flavor here, but the sausage was reaaallly good. So I didn't strike out entirely, especially with bites of what my buddies ordered. One got the fish of the day with jambalaya, and it was good. The fish was tasty but unfortunately overcooked. Jambalaya was good. And ONE hush puppy. ONE. Why? Other friend got Shrimp and Grits. This was the win! Really delicious gravy, nice juicy shrimps, flavorful grits. This saved the deal for all three of us, and the tasty fried pickles helped. We also got fried green tomatoes with shrimp remoulade - Green tomatoes were good but needed help from some sauce, and the shrimp remoulade wasn't it. Pretty bland for a remoulade, more like a shrimp salad. They get props for a cool atmosphere, good drinks, and a few friendly servers (though ours was pretty snobby and slow).

SLOW turnover, and slow service. I was initially thrilled by the menu, which is pretty eclectic for soul food. Unfortunately the fried chicken was just kinda dry and average, as were the potatoes. The crab and grits came swimming in butter, which should normally be a good thing, but really was excessive. Maybe I'm biased, but I grew up on fried chicken, crab cakes, and grits and I wouldn't come back here for any of those. Too bad.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-16", "description": "The Front Porch offers up a blend of southern-inspired foods with some \"caribbean\" flair thrown in for good measure, all wrapped up in a cozy atmosphere that provides understated simplicity and elegance.  But soul food it's not.\n\nMy friends and I arrived on a Friday evening, and took a look at their drink menu while waiting for our table.  Their drink menu isn't particularly extensive, though they do offer a decent selection of wines, beers, sparkling wines, and some innovative house drinks.  I ended up settling on an \"Electric Marmalade,\" a fruity concoction of muddled peaches, muscato d'asti, and dry kumquat soda (or something like that).  It was light and refreshing, certainly sweeter than I probably originally expected, but very good.  Later in the evening, I opted for a Perseophone, a mix of biodynamic dry cider, pomegranate juice, apples, and lemons, which was certainly another smooth, easily drinkable hit.  Unfortunately on these two cocktails, the strength was a little less than good...being blessed with the wonderful genetic mishap that causes \"asian glow\", I was surprised that despite two drinks, one on an empty stomach, the other mid-meal, I barely felt anything, which is odd considering that even a few sips of wine will cause the glow to arise, if even for a moment.  But I digress.\n\nThe four of us opted to split a fried chicken bucket, adding on a side of mashed potatoes and corn in addition to the black eyed peas/collard greens and grits.  To start us off, we partook in the Double and Ribs and Wings.  The ribs, while tasty, were small, and certainly tougher than I was accustomed to in Atlanta.  The meat did not immediately fall off the bone, and some inevitably clung to the bone for dear life, which in my book is the sign of a rib that hasn't been cooked well.  The wings, on the other hand, were a great spicy jerk concoction that provided a fair amout of heat along with flavor.  And served alongside both of these were house-made (I'm assuming) chips, which were incredbly thin and light.  The Double is a mix of chick peas and squash, apparently, and served up a delightfully smooth, spicy, and creamy texture all in one.\n\nThen arrived the main attraction - a bucket of fried chicken, served in a popcorn bucket with popcorn.  While the chicken was most certainly crisp and tender, I found the fry to be a little lacking in flavor.  While crunchy, nothing really jumped out at me saying \"check out this flavor that is enhancing everything\" or even waving meekly asking to be noticed.  I wonder if it was simply a cornmeal dredge with perhaps a drizzling of salt and pepper.  I was tempted to ask for ketchup, but decided to leave it as is.  However, it was thankfully not overly greasy, which is an easy crime to commit.\n\nServed alongside were black eyed peas and collard greens, cooked with pork belly as appropriate.  These were tasty and thankfully did not leave any grease on the palate.  The grits are creamy, perhaps a little too creamy in texture, and drizzled with some chili oil that gave it just a little kick.  The mashed potatoes were my favorite of the sides, as The Front Porch mashes some additional vegetable in (I'm not sure what it is), providing an extra level of flavor before dousing it with gravy.  And finally, the corn was sweet and tender, though the chili peppers they sprinkled on top left my mouth on fire for a good five minutes before consumption of mashed potatoes managed to wick away the spice.\n\nUnfortunately, none of the desserts seemed all that appealing, with all of us opting to go somewhere else instead (Mitchell's is right around the corner), so nothing can be said about their dessert selection.\n\nOverall, the service was friendly and attentive, and very relaxed, which is fitting for the restaurant.  The portions are perhaps a little smaller than what we've become accustomed to, and perhaps split amongst four people they quickly diminish in filling power, but for an individual, two sides would be plenty.  Finally, the pricing certainly isn't too bad, especially if something like the bucket of chicken is split, along with appetizers.  Menu prices range from the high single-digits for an appetizer, with most sides falling in safely at $6, while entrees are a comfortable high-10s to mid-20s.  What's great, though, is that by splitting, and with two drinks each, the four of us only came out to just over $30/person, including tax/tip.  Not bad.\n\nThe one downside to the whole experience is the pre-spicification (chili hot) of almost everything...from the corn, to the grits, to the greens.  There are certain things that can have a little spice, but some were certainly more pungent than expected, and not always expected in the right places.\n\nIn all though, The Front Porch provides a relaxed atmosphere for anything from a (small) group of friends to a date spot.  However, beware for those going for a date...it can get a little loud, especially as more patrons begin to trickle in for the", "author": "Mark C."}

Though please avoid the temptation to ask for seconds because, really, it's a sin to fill up on delicious cornbread before you can get to the delicious other parts of the menu.\n\nOne star gets docked purely for the wait. I hear they take reservations, but I've come here before to wait out a table, and believe me, it's worth the wait, if only for the food and the atmosphere.

You're not supposed to make a patron feel that way, no matter how crowded it is.

The grits were buttery delicious, and the subtly spiced crab complimented them well. The little corncob cornbread was cute, and the maple-y butter hit the spot. We were subsequently presented with a bucket that was overflowing with fried chicken. (Shit, it BETTA be overflowing if you gonna charge me $32 dollars for seven pieces of chicken! What does it cost at Popeye's ... 'bout $10 for a bucket of 20??? But I digress.) I didn't actually like cornmeal breading. I found it dry and lacking flavor, though the chicken was extremely moist and tender. They've clearly got the frying down to a science. Red beans and rice with a side of plantains hit the spot. Our stomachs were near exploding by the time the lovely waitress handed us the dessert menus, but I'm so glad that we ordered the chocolate bread pudding! It was near perfect - by far the best part of the meal.\n\nOther notes: \n\nI found the d\u00e9cor a little weird in an intriguing way. The ceiling tiles were crazy and reminded me of my grandmama's friend's house. As much as I like Santogold, I found that her sound somehow clashed with my meal.

Although it seemed to be fresh, good quality chicken, it tasted like it had either been overcooked or more likely, cooked in oil that had been used too long.  Service was OK.  \nI still had my coupon so I went back for lunch a few weeks later to try something else.  I told the server that I'd be using the coupon (probably a mistake) and ordered a Cesar salad and an order of shrimp and grits.  The salad was good.  The shrimp and grits ($14) came in a cast iron skillet with exactly four shrimp and so little grits that I at first couldn't find them in the sauce.  What little that was there was good. Service was friendly.  \nI don't know if I got the \"mini\" portion because I was using a coupon or if this is standard service.  In any event, I think I'll head out to Hard Knox next time I crave chicken", "author": "Jeff Z."}

At 9 pm, the place was packed and the bar was 2 deep.  I thought it was everything one could hope for in a neighborhood restaurant:  vibey, funky, and quirky with a friendly if somewhat too relaxed staff, good beer on tap, nice selection of wines by the glass, a place to sit outside and enjoy your beverages while waiting for a table and really tasty food.  Flavors were great in everything we tried.  Home made hot sauce on the table was more of a souped up ketchup but I can easily look beyond that to the delcious crispy-on the-outside-moist-on-the-inside chicken,  creamy grits, savory black-eyed peas, refreshing cucumber salad and zesty cole slaw.  Everything was really good and the prices are right.   A great local restaurant and worth a drive if you live out of the hood as well.", "author": "Lulu L."}

The Front Porch was near by and had really great reviews so I ventured here with my friend. The feel of the place is really southern, sorta witch-crafty. It's dark, low ceilings, random wall decorations. We sat in the back, the long seats have seat belts which I thought was kind of clever. Anyways, so I thought sitting in the back was cool until the kitchen got all smoky. The kitchen is open counter, literally 3 feet away from where I was sitting. I left with my hair and sweater smelling like crap, -1 star for that. Anyways, I wasn't too hungry so I got 2 starters, the mac & cheese and gumbo. Both were good and very tasty. I liked the mac & cheese best! So flavorful and... Cheesy. Haha. The gumbo was thick and filled with okra and sausage with a little spicy-ness, but I just don't care for that taste too much. My friend got the friend chicken and with his first bite, all these juices came flowing out too. Honestly, it didn't look to appealing then. It came with mashed potatoes and veggies. All in all, it was an alright dinner. Didn't dig it too much. Soul food just ain't my thing.", "author": "Jackie M."}

The food was downright excellent. From the crawfish to the jambalaya to the corn on the cob, everything was just so succulent.

If it was just another soul food joint I'd probably smile and be thankful, but the Caribbean influence made itNOT a soul food joint, and  simply too good to pass up.  \nThe wait for a table at 6:30 was at first glance obscene, but then, when faced with a very pleasant 'front porch', complete with rocking chairs and la petite drink holding tables for waiting....I ceased my complaining and sat my foodie ass down with a drink menu. \nThe drink menu is sublime, with more than a  little word play to make it fun, and indeed, it was. I made my way through three of their mixed drinks, most satisfied with the Lil Rouge Corvette. One can only sample so many alcoholic beverages before risking the rest of the review. \nThe appetizer selection was wonderful, we had decided on the Platter of Meat prior to even sitting down. Not that we are devoted meat fanatics, but come on, it's a Platter of Meat, anyone would be just a little intrigued. There were 3 meats on the platter, all extremely good (the pork belly was very thick and very....pork bellyish)\nThe main menu is seasonal, the next change up being 4 days from now. Do not be fooled, this is not supposed to be down south soul food, it's soul food cuisine, it's .....California genius. It's not your mama's pork chop, it's a rum and molasses brined 2 inch thick chop. Grilled to perfection and topped with a garlicy buttery herb sauce, served with your mama's mac n cheese and (in my case) spicy sauteed spinach. It was the best pork chop I've ever laid teeth into, by far. I only mention what I ordered to emphasize the detail that the folks in the kitchen (all beautifully tattooed I might mention) put into every single entree that leaves their hands. \nThe dessert menu didn't thrill me, if only because I was sated by everything that preceded it. I ordered off menu, coconut icecream with chocolate sauce, which my husband declared tasted like a frozen almond joy candy bar. And indeed, it did. The perfect end to a fabulous meal. \nThe service was wonderful, despite the fact our waitress forgot to mention the specials (that's okay, we knew exactly what we wanted) and the check was a bit delayed (more time to chat with my husband). Every detail was attended to, I watched a server quickly get down eye level with the table to ensure the silverware was lined up perfectly, water was kept full, timing of courses was masterful. The place has ambiance, the ceiling is punched tin tiles, in the bathroom as well. The walls are brilliant Caribbean blue , the floor a checkerboard of black and white. The wait staff is young and very San Francisco, which translates as tattooed, pierced and interestingly coiffed, but very upscale in their delivery of service. \nThis place is worth every penny and every minute you search for parking (hint; go to the Bank of America on Mission after 6pm on weekdays and anytime on weekends and holidays, $10 gets you parking about 2 blocks from the restaurant)", "author": "lisa s."}

The chicken was juicy and full of great flavor.  My second bite was just as the first, however, it was the third bite that killed it for me.  I don't know about you, but when I bite into a piece of chicken, only to find that myself spitting it out due to the fact that the center was TOTALLY RAW!  Absolutely disgusting.  It was at this time that another in my party found the same thing.\n\nBut I guess I could get over it, but when we told the staff, they didn't seem too concerned.  They took the piece of chicken and brought it to the chef.  It was about 15 minutes later that she returned, with the single piece of chicken in a bowl.  They did not have the decency to provide us with new pieces of chicken; instead, they returned the same piece that looked like it had sat in a fryer for 3 months.  What kind of service is that?  Any it was even more annoying is to have the wait staff continue to bug us about clearing out plates when our raw chicken was still in the fryer.  Horrible.\n\nNeedless to say, I was very disappointed.  Every place can make a mistake, but it is how you handle that mistake that leaves a lasting impression.

I really look forward to eating here on a regular basis but that won't happen til the buzz/hype for the Front Porch dies down. It took about an hour and a half for a table for 4 (we were told it would take 45 mins.) and the crowd was made up of some people dressed to the nines for a place that their main draw is a bucket of fried chicken. That is not to say the restaurant isn't nice, because it is. It is just more of a cozy laid back nice.

Being from the South I have this natural attraction to regional delicacies that aren't a main staple out West.  The Front Porch definitely hit the nail on the head with this one too!  Cheesy, garlicky, spicy from the jalapenos and with oodles of crab for the group.  If I could have it my way I'd get 3 orders of Crab Grits, 3 orders of Conch Fritters and a pitcher of Sweet Tea.  The grilled hearts of romaine with the bacon pieces was an excellent starter contrast to the conch fritters too.  Our group loved the duck pate' with the chutney, I just can't do it.  The fried chicken was pretty good too.  Tal K. liked it so much he ate my last piece (fatty)  Pamela, our server, was incredible!  She knew when to chat us up and knew when to leave us alone.

The grits and crab dish was so rich it was gross, and the crab accounted for about 5% of the dish itself.  It would make a good side dish to a nice grilled piece of fish or something light like that.  The Island Pepper Pot Stew had a tasty broth, but the meat was covered in fat.  For $19 of stew meat,  it should have been better.  The escavietch fresh fish was dry and lacked flavor -- again for $19 dollars.  The fried chicken was the best thing at the table, but for less money you can go to Farmer Brown, Popeye's or Blue Jay Cafe and get more chicken with better flavor.  I hate to sound like a biotch on Yelp, so I will tell you that the ambiance is great and the service was absolutely some of the best we've had in a long time.

The last 2 time I've been there I ordered the crab & grits, voted \"best new dish\" in one of the local weekly paper's \"Best of the Bay\" issues. The crab & grits is good, but not worth waiting for.\nI like the grungy chic look they have going on, but we thought it was so Tacky, when my boyfriend ordered a glass of wine, & at our table, they poured it for him out of what looked like a child's juice box (without the straw taped to the side).\nThe food is expensive, In my opinion, this place is WAY OVERRATED.\nI live in the neighborhood (walking distance) so I've been in there 3 times.

I had been bragging about how much we san franciscans are true foodies.  Oops.  Ok, I understand, day before a new menu, which I know NOW, but if a dish is unserve-able...then, er, don't serve it.  I ordered the vegan option, because I've had such amazing experiences with their vegan one-pot stew in the past.  This time, however, a more apt name would have been \"new menu tomorrow so let's grill whatever we've got and throw it on some rice.\"  This concept is ok when I am poor and will eat anything I've got at home.  But when I'm paying for a meal at a restaurant, not so much.  The server (who, as always, was super cool), described the dish as having eggplant and some other stuff over coconut scented rice with Serrano pepper.  What actually showed up in front of me was coconut scented rice with two HUGE grilled Serrano peppers, and some chunks of sweet plaintain mixed in the rice.  The main vegetables were TWO SERRANO peppers, and the eggplant was nowhere to be found.  I took a bite of the pepper thinking it was eggplant because it was so huge and prominent on the plate (and it was grilled so the color had faded).  Now I like spicy, but that was not edible.  It took twenty minutes for my throat to de numb.  That is just plain dangerous and shouldn't be served.   We mentioned it to the server, who laughed it off and we like it there a lot and definitely did not want to make it an issue and cause an awkward situation.  I didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but I was seriously displeased.   I didn't touch the rest of my meal, mostly because I couldn't swallow, and I was disappointed in the service aspect of things to not notice that and try to fix things.  Paying 14 bucks to have my throat set on fire (and I re-iterate, I love spice, I put siracha or tabasco on everything) is not my ideal of a nice night out.

We were first seated in a booth and the 4 of us seem a little confined and moments later the corner booth opened up with much more space so I inquired about us moving 2 feet to the vacant booth.  The hostess was very reluctant to move us as she was looking around the restaurant apparently looking for somebody... she reluctantly gave us permission to move.\n  As we sat at our new table it was evident why she wanted us to stay at our original table..  Her friends came in and sat at our old table.  I want to say THANK YOU to her because all she had to say to me was, \"I'm sorry, but the big table is reserved.\" and that would of been the end of it but no she would rather for us to be comfortable, again thank you.\n  We had one server and she was very good and attentive, not just my server,but the whole front of the house staff took care of our table and it wasn't just my table it was the whole restaurant.\n \n  We ordered the Chicken and the Crab and Grits with an order of the BBQ shrimp for an appetizer.  Our server informed us \"We have a new Chef \"and \"we don't have the crab anymore and he will replace it with shrimp\".  I heard some very good thing about the crab etc. but I said I'll give it a try anyway.\n  The BBQ arrived and for $11 I was highly disappointed.  The shrimp was extremely over cooked and pasty and and the size of the shrimp were 31-40's not 16 -20's so they were very small and when over cooked it was the size of a nickle! and there was only 5.  The craw fish that came with it was just a shell no meet inside  to suck out(which is the best thing about craw fish) and no craw fish tail to mention.\n  The entrees arrived along with 2 side dishes, mashed potato's and collard greens.  I come from and Irish family back east and my mother would hit me with a frying pan if I served her what I received that night.  It was very lumpy!  Don't get me wrong..  it was good and it was made from scratch and not a box, but chef needs to take his time getting rid of the lumps.  The chicken was outstanding!  I saw my step daughter devour the fried chicken!  It remained me of viewing the Discovery Channel watching the Lions in Africa eating a free buffet of Wilder Beast!  Honest to God!  I saw her sucking the bone!  I was afraid to touch her plate for her to slow down for the fear of my limb!\n  My Crab and Grits(sorry shrimp), again shrimp undersized and over cooked and pasty and not much of a portion but I ate it.  The grits, I could not tell the difference between a good grit and a bad grit, I'm from the Northeast part of the country but I have had them before and it taste like any other grit but the flavor was masked behind the very good hot sauce.

The mac and red beans and rice were ok.. but not screaming.  I can say though they were prepared a lil different, the plantains were good.  All in all the meal is nice, but all the sides stood out not the main dishes they were kinda bland to my soul food palette.", "author": "Wes H."}

There is one vegan entree on the menu (which rocks!!). However there are a few starters and sides that are vegetarian as well and are very good. The waiter was very patient as we went through our limited choices to figure out the order. The only thing I didn't appreciate is being charged the full price for a 1/3 of a starter dish that comprised of beans and toast. The original entree included salmon, deviled eggs amongst other things. The only thing we got was a minimized beans and toast. Normally, I wouldn't complain about that, however this dish definitely didn't seem worth the full price. 4 stars for excellent food and great service.", "author": "Beena A."}

But I got dragged to this place the other night because I am a former French Quarter resident and LSU grad - so pals of mine always want to take me to southern/cajun/creole places. Why? I don't know why...because I always tell them that I have NEVER had good Louisiana cooking outside of Louisiana - simple as that. But I went along willingly - with an open heart and an open mind probably brought on by the fact that I was seriously Jones'n for some really good red beans and rice and a bowl of real Louisiana style gumbo. Cute place - pretty good service - cold beer - comfy booths and tables - nice crowd of people - all good so far. So we order all the really southern items on the menu - that's why we went there - who goes to a place like this and orders a burger? Yelpers do - that's who - because they are bozo's and don't know any better - then they write about it because they think they are qualified to do so and that somebody out there cares. Listen up Yelpers - they don't. If it weren't for your Mom and your \"friends\" that tell you how funny you are - no one would read the uninformed crap that you write. This place was such a bust it is hard to know where to begin? Where they found the recipes for some of this food is a real mystery? The food was so bad it's almost like you would have to intentionally try to cook it that poorly. If you bill yourself as a southern food joint - and you serve inedible gumbo, lousy red beans and rice, mediocre greens, OK shrimp and grits and hush puppies like none I have ever eaten before (and not in a good way) - well then you deserve to get some not so nice things said about your place. This food was not OK or mediocre or \"maybe I'll try it again\" kinda food - it was just bad. Really bad. Yet I felt bad when we left - I liked the way the joint felt - someone has put their heart and soul into it and created a place with a great feeling and a cool crew. But the food we had was terrible and I will never be able to return there again. So - thanks again Yelpers! You've kept your track record in tact - another highly rated Yelper joint that was just about as bad as bad can be.

I called up to find out they don't take reservations so a friend and I got off work early so we can get a table before the dinner crowd. The ambiance of this place was a little confusing. The kitschy southern decor felt very out of place in the dark moody lighting. It's like this place couldn't make up it's mind on whether it's a date spot or a family friendly restaurant. So we got the menu and the fried chicken entree came as either a regular plate meal or in a bucket. Now...chicken in a bucket. That's a good sign. So I ordered the chicken of course. Maybe I was a bit too hyped up about the fried chicken and the whole buildup only lead to disappointment when I took the first few bites. First off, fried chicken needs to be greasy and that fried skin..... Oh, that fried skin NEEDS to be crunchy. The skin on this baby wasn't as juicy and succulent as it could have been. Overall, the chicken I got was only OK. It was maybe a step above KFC (and I loves my KFC).

They have a small, but excellent beer list, including St. Peter's Cream Stout, quite possibly my favorite beer ever, and an excellent accompaniment to some competent fried chicken.  The menu is eclectic and so are the prices - some entrees are 30+, but the burger is only $11.  Personally I like that - you want gourmet food, you pay gourmet prices.  The chicken is a great deal at about $15.  Service was pretty attentive with occasional lapses.

The bartender and all of the servers were so amazingly friendly/attentive/unpretentious that we were immediately relaxed and had no regrets about not waiting for a table.  I thought that the interior was very cool and comfortable, kind of like those antiquated spots in New Orleans where you get the best soul food. So then the food started arriving: first the delicious cornbread, simple and uncomplicated. The perfect compliment to a before dinner cocktail.  Then we split the salad with watermelon turnip and grapefruit, a great combination of texture, sweet, cold = very refreshing.  I opted for the fried chicken plate for dinner and had NO regrets.  I grew up in Mississippi as a kid, then later in the Midwest, so I've had great fried chicken before.  This fried chicken was especially moist, tender, and with the crispiest batter that wasn't greasy.  Really good flavor. The potatoes and cole slaw served with it were seasoned well, I liked that they didn't compete with the delicious chicken. Oh, and we split the macaroni pie, I highly recommend!  Very moist with simple seasoning and maybe a yummy bread crumb crust? I usually never (well, rarely) have dessert, but the food was all so good and surprisingly light so I was curious how they could top it all off?  We opted to split the fried grits with corn custard and sour cherries.  It showed up, the fried grits were really dry until we realized that you have to dip the grits into the custard = wow!

All in all this a great neighborhood restaurant and a nice use of local ingredients in a style you don't see much in SF.", "author": "Jonathan B."}

The fried chicken was to die for, along with the homemade doughnut-like desert, every bite seriously melted in my mouth. Minus a point because my mac-and-cheese was cold, but I still ate it all, so it was good. Also minus a point because I was so stuffed I couldn't eat for two days, well actually extra point for being delicious soul food!", "author": "Maya L."}

We had the grits w/crab, crab salad, jerk chicken and lamb stew.  I was great....amazing.  I cook some mean soul food myself...but I always enjoy the meals I have here.  The wait staff is wonderful and the service is.... quick draw ...fast... I have never had to wait....guess I have been lucky!!!", "author": "deborah w."}

I went on a whim with some friends who love it and I was really surprised at how good it was. The vegan plate was probably the best I've had of that sort of entree. The appetizers were great and there was a lot of variety. The servers and bartender were super friendly. The atmosphere reminded me of the now defunct 16th St. restaurant, New Dawn, that used to be a great breakfast place back in college. I will definitely recommend this to people and will be coming back.", "author": "Michelle M."}

The menu was extremely limited and was quite a let down.  We ordered the chicken and fish n chips, but it was hard to find much fish between all that batter; shame.  The chicken was good, but I don't know.....I've had better and I can't say it warranted the price.  I ordered a side of greens and beans, and was expecting just that; instead it was a small bowl of cooked saucy beans with some small bits of greens mixed in.  Poor!  The music was way too loud, which made trying to have any kind of a conversation impossible.  Basically, if this place was a little road side stand with outside  bench seating and the dinners were about $5 -7 bucks, you might have something.  Instead, I found the food and dining experience extremely unappealing.  Maybe we should have been drinking.", "author": "Tige F."}

You can't get ribs unless you get it with the wings in the appetizer. The fried chicken is just okay. Lots of seasoning. The skin comes off the meat way too easily. The accompanying slaw doesn't really taste like much. The burger has good meat, but the patty is just disgustingly thick. The fries were good. Pretty crispy for steak fries. The street corn was good. But it's just corn on the cob and it's $5.  I'll seek out another fried chicken place.", "author": "James C."}

It was walkable, the staff were friendly and accommodating-and when they told us they were out of the Vegan Pot, they offered other veggie options. When one of our party did not get the Mahi Mahi she ordered at the same time other meals were served, the staff brought her a salad on the house-great food, good service, highly recommend this place! I will go back.", "author": "Lisa S."}

I am a down home southern gal and I can tell you right now that this isn't by far a soul food restaurant. We order the \"famous fried chicken\" and infamous it was. The chicken wasn't cruncky and it didn't have not a drop of salt or pepper and no other kind of seasoning. I was so disappointed, the okra was good and the oyster popeboy sandwich was alright. For a party of 10 we spent over $300 bucks and it wasn't worth it. On top of that at the end of our meal we told the waiter that the food was horrible and that the chicken wasn't cruncky or seasoned and she said that it was the chefs first night and thanks for telling us about the food so that we can tell the chef that he needs to season the chicken and fry it longer. As much hype as this place gets and for us to have that type of experience was a big diappointment and until the newly hired chef learns how to cook the menu I wouldn't recommend going here unless you just want okra .", "author": "Colara H."}

If you need to watch your finances and like good food but think that maybe once in a while it would be nice to eat somewhere everybody says is great do NOT go here.  For $22 I had mahimahi in the shape of baby's fist that was over cooked, absolutely tasteless, dry and tough.  It was served with a scattering of cold, flavorless, indistinguishable tasting vegetables (potatoes? parsnips? yucca? WHAT??).  Went with two friends. The fried chicken was three oh-so tiny pieces, like it came from a cornish game hen, and although considered an entree was more like a really small appetizer.  The hamburger left a very strange aftertaste.  The crab appetizer was mostly grits and came in a ramekin so small it was laughable.  Add one glass of wine.  Total, with tip was $86.00 for food that was really enough for ONE hungry person.  Give me a break!  I felt scammed, fooled, cheated, dissatisfied, disappointed, MAD!!  Oh, yeah, and the long wait, the noise and the off-putting service............ what was there to like?  This place reminds me of the children's story of the Emperor With No Clothes.

It was all black but it was sooooo damn moist and just pure yum! \nI went all out and got the bucket of fried chicken which came w/a side of grits & a splash of chili oil (i'd go back just to eat the grits...so yummy and buttery goodness) and a side of black peas (mmm...down home goodness). Now, the chicken...even tho i ordered the bucket, dont expect a KFC bucket..it came in a medium sized old school popcorn bucket filled to the brim & 3 lovely pcs. on the side of the plate--If i had to estimate, you get about 10-12 pcs. (12 pcs. if ur super lucky or if that chicken was damn small) for the bucket & those 2 sides. yea, $32 for a bucket of chicken?? crazy but it was good chicken...none of that grease-dripping, fatty pieces of chicken at the fast food joints! I detected a hint of lemony tang to every bite of chicken and thought the meat was a little too \"well-seasoned\" for my taste (but it wasnt unbearably salty--just very flavorful)...then i found out from the bartender that the chicken is marinated in lime & salt for a day--ah ha!! right on the money, I am a food detective!!\n\nmy friend and i had a sangria...very tasty b/c its made w/guava puree--yummers. oh but the best thing was this miraculous honey, chili flakes whipped butter that goes w/the cornbread...oh shit, that was gooooood! it's was orgasmic good--who would've thought of that combo? i'm soo gonna make that shit now to go w/my bread but u gotta use good quality honey & unsalted butter (whoops the secret's out!) \n\nso, 4 cocktails total ($25), a jerk chicken ($20), and a bucket of fried chicken ($32)=$97.00 for 2 ppl w/ tip & tax (and a whole bucket of fried chicken for leftovers to take home)...not bad but a bit of a splurge for a simple weeknite dinner. \n\nonly con, hence, the -1star is parking is a PAIN here! thats the only reason why i'd come here once in a blue moon...next time, carpool--i cant even suggest a good time to come b/c parking's a bitch in this 'hood 24/7! \nthank god, i have a parking god...only took me 5 min. to find a spot waiting for me :-) but too bad for my friend..took him 20 min. to find a spot (and thats considered good around here)", "author": "Yolanda L."}
