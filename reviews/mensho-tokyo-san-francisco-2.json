The bar seating overlooks the kitchen. \n\nAfter being seated the server came over quickly and I went ahead and ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen with a soft boil egg. The service was very efficient and friendly. The ramen was also brought out quickly. The broth was very rich and flavorful and the meat was tender. However, the egg was sweeter than I expected and closer to hard boiled than soft.    \n\nThey also charge a mandatory 15% service fee into the bill and they don't have any take out containers but you can bring your own.

And listen - the vegan ramen is incredible. The pork ramen was great, don't get me wrong - flavorful broth, tender cuts of meat, textured veggies, etc. But for those who don't eat meat, the vegan ramen is honestly on par if not better than the pork ramen in flavor. It's incredibly rich and nutty (there are literal nuts at the bottom from making the broth!) and honestly tastes like the real thing.", "author": "Angela Z."}

We got there at around 5:40 and we're sitting inside the restaurant at about 7:15PM. I would really call this an absurd wait, but the line lived long and even got longer as we inched along. \nWhy? \nI wish this would be followed with \"BECAUSE THIS WAS THE BEST EVER\". But no. My why wasn't answered in that way. Why would you stand the chill of night to cram into a tiny restaurant for some just good ramen? The answer remains elusive to me. \nSo here are the details- remember, I didn't say this place wasn't good, I am coming from the point of view of how worthy it was of an extended and cold wait. \n\nWe had the cream based ramen with duck and pork and the heavily advertised A5 wagyu beef ramen. The cream based ramen had dense soup that though thick didn't leave the oily residue you might think it will. It sticks nicely to the noodles and gets soaked up by the kale in the bowl. The bits of duck and pork were good, and soft. And the onion shavings kept things interesting. Thing is, I didn't really get awe struck with the little differences. The duck was new, and delicious but not extraordinary. The broth was simply broth, yes with a new twist but still- broth. \nThe A5 expensive ramen bowl was ok. It was advertised as only 10 served a day, but our party had two bowls (we weren't first in line by any means...) and they were still offering it after we left. I guess it's not the main reason folks come here. The beef was scrumptious but the broth was a bit of a letdown. It was light but at the same time it was super oily. The noodles were great... but really it was just a big slab of beef (delicious) on top of noodles. I guess wagyu is expensive... but I wouldn't run to get it again. \nOverall, would I go back or recommend this place? \nVery likely, I won't go back. If someone else were to ask me, I would probably encourage them to go during a weekday to possibly avoid the extended wait. In any case, if you're already in line- you might as well.", "author": "Nadia H."}

Not worth waiting almost 2 hours for.\n\nThis place is super tiny so you better be prepared to wait up to 2 hours before  being seated. Decor is very clean and service is good. \n\nEnoki Chips:\nYou ever go to a Chinese restaurant and order that deep fries prawns that have that tasty outer batter? Yeah, picture that but flavor enhanced by 1000x times. The enoki was so crispy and had me foodgasming with every bite. Make sure you save some to dip in your ramen. 5/5!!!\n\nA5 Wagyu Ramen:\nThis is where they lost major points with me. When the bowl first came to me, my mouth was salivating like Beethoven slobbering all over the bed. Even the first sip of broth was beefy heaven in a bowl and the meat itself was tender, but there was still some chewing involved. My complaint about this dish was the fact that they had put way too much garlic, onion, and ginger in this dish that it  took all the broth and beefy essence away from the experience. The beef and the broth are the stars of this dish. Why ruin the flavor by muddling it with random ingredients? I would have much preferred if they only gave me beef and broth and call it a day. Even the noodles themselves were a bit undercooked for my standard. For $50, I was underwhelmed. 3/5.\n\nMatcha Ramen:\nThe broth was so creamy, but so light. The chashu was very soft and the matcha powder actually accentuated the flavors of this dish. A much better experience than the A5. 5/5.\n\nThis is one of those places where you just have to try once and never have to go back again. Albeit their quality and variety stand out from the rest of the crowd, it's probably not somewhere you want to wait hours in line for more than once.", "author": "Jonathan K."}

Yelpers said they waited at least 30 minutes to an hour. We waited over an hour and half. And we got there when they opened at 5. I think the best thing is to start queueing up at 4:15, that way you will be the first or second seating. For us we were the third seating and I was pretty tired by the time I got into the restaurant. It's not like Marufuku in Japantown where you can actually go and look at different shops so the time passes by quickly. Lesson learned. \n\nI came with my friend and thank goodness we were not that hungry because by the time we got seated, we were starving. Inside there are long tables that are meant to be shared.  We ordered Oysters in Shoyu and dare oil as a starter. \n\nI ordered the Spicy Tori Paitan (chicken soup, pork chashu, menma, spicy jalapeno miso, cabbage, fried burdock and green onion) $17: I've been looking for a ramen place with thick egg noodles in SF and I've finally found it! The ramen was al dente and the spicy jalapeno miso added just enough kick to it. The chicken soup was very thick, almost to the point of being viscous, and was very flavorful. I loved the crunchy fried burdock root and perfectly cooked soft boiled egg. I liked that the pork chasu was not too fatty and was able to eat most of the meat. \n\nService was quick and our server moved quickly in between tables and taking orders. \n\nI'll definitely come back here but now I know to come extra early to be in the first seating of the night.", "author": "Nette T."}

You just stand outside in a single line waiting for people to finish. I don't think you can make reservations or be on a waitlist online. (if so, lmk) I went on a weekday around 5:30pm and waited about 20 minutes.\n\n2. It's very small. You definitely will feel crowded but hey, many Japanese restaurants follow this trend.\n\n3. The food is yum! We got 4 different ramens (Matcha Tori Paltan ($17), Spicy Tori Paltan ($17), Spicy lamb ($16), and the special limited beef ($39)) The beef ramen is $39 and only offers 10 per day. My friend got the limited beef and said it was okay. Still very good ramen but the meat wasn't amazing. I personally loved the Spicy Tori Paltan ramen here. The noodles are so tasty. Perfectly chewy and the soup is amazing! The rest enjoyed their Matcha and spicy lamb as well.\n\n4. Service is nice but it's busy so you probably won't get the best service in town. They are kind and helpful but they did forget our drinks and didn't refill our waters when they were empty. \n\n5. It's located in a sketchy part of the neighborhood. It should be safe since there will probably be other people waiting in line for you but be careful.\n\n6. The interior is nice though. Nicely decorated. They were playing Buzzfeed Tasty videos on the TV.\n\n7. The price is a little high for a Japanese Ramen, but I personally think it's worth it. Starting price around $16 but add ons which cost more.\n\nOverall, my favorite ramen place in SF. I only been to 2 places (read my review of Marufuku on my profile) but so far this place is #1. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone and everyone. Definitely will be back!", "author": "Shin L."}

The wait after that was about 40 minutes long as the restaurant is quite small. \n\nI ordered the tori paitan while my boyfriend ordered the shoyu. We also ordered the two appetizers: oysters and enoki chips. Both were tasty but the oysters were a bit too salty for me and so I enjoyed the enoki chips much more. I thought these were quite unique and tasted really good with a little lemon on top or even dipped into the ramen broth. As for the ramen, I found my tori paitan to be very flavorful and I loved the thick and toothsome noodles. While the frothy broth was interesting at first, I feel like this caused the ramen to cool down really quick, making it less tasty. My favorite part, however, was actually the duck chashu! Cooked perfectly- I wish I ordered more! The shoyu was quite good as well and I actually preferred the broth of the shoyu to the tori paitan. \n\nOverall it was a pretty good meal, a little pricey but not too extravagant.

Unfortunately when everyone knows this, you can also expect to wait in a sizable line. On a Sunday evening over Labor Day Weekend, we waited a little over an hour for 3 people. \n\nMensho actually has a pretty decent ramen selection. There's the traditional options, there's chicken based broth, and a vegan broth. This is already 5/5 to me because I love being able to take all my friends with dietary restrictions to ramen. Also, they let me make a substitution to my order (of getting duck instead of pork). So service is definitely 5/5.\n\nMoving on to the actual ramen. So I think the broth here is pretty stellar. Good texture, right amount of creaminess, and tastes savory. I actually wasn't the biggest fan of the noodles- they were a little too firm for me. Apparently the noodles differ between which ramen you order, so I guess maybe it's just the bowl I got. \n\nOverall, Mensho is absolutely delicious, don't get me wrong. The reason I have to boil it down to 4 stars is going to be a. the noodles and b. the wait. Even though other ramen places in the city are brutal with waits, the fact that you're just in the middle of the TL with nothing to do but starve in line with your dear ramen buddies makes it hard to justify coming to Mensho again and again. If the wait were to divide by two, I could make it a monthly visit.\n\nDefinitely a must-go if you love ramen and reside in the Bay!", "author": "Arezou A."}

As in, prior to this experience, I had never really had ramen other than the individual pouches of Mr. Noodles with those nifty flavour packets.\n\nI wanted my first ramen experience to be amazing, so I did my research and I came across Mensho Tokyo and decided it would be a great addition to my foodie adventures on my San Fran vacay. I was totally pumped and ready to love it.\n\nTo start, I went there prepared to wait in line. Reviews advised that the wait would be around 30 minutes, ours was a bit closer to 40 but we did go around 7:00pm, prime dinner time, I guess! Fortunately the wait time gave us time to peruse the menu and decide what to order. I am thankful that the menu is not overwhelmingly long, but there were several interesting options so I had to choose carefully.\n\nOnce we got in, we could tell that the space is small, fitting maybe 20-25 people, which does explain the lineup. It has a nice cozy charm to it though, with a type of communal seating, and wall decor. Somehow it made the experience feel more authentic and worth the wait. This might not be ideal for some people looking for an intimate or private meal.\n\nWe decided to try the Enoki mushroom chips to start. I have absolutely zero regrets here- they were freakin' delicious! In fact, I would have been perfectly satisfied with a bowl of these for dinner! They're kind of like crispy onion strings you can get on burgers, same texture... but the flavour is just yummy. Disclaimer: I am a bit of a mushroom fanatic, so if you don't like mushrooms, these might not be for you.\n\nAfter much deliberation and recommendations from our server, I ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen (double chashu) which is what they are known for. I was given the heads up that this is not \"typical\" ramen as it has a creamier soup, but I thought I'd try it anyway. I'll start by saying- the pork and duck chashu were delicious. Super tender and packed full of flavour. I loved it. The noodles were also done well. Not too soft, but not too hard, just what I expected. Unfortunately that is where my enjoyment ends. \n\nI won't fault the restaurant for it, but apparently I am not much of a miso fan and maybe I'm just not that into ramen, even though I really wanted to be! I did enjoy the overall experience, and will say that even though there was a bit of a mishap with my soup- our server worked quickly with her manager to rectify the situation, which I always do appreciate.\n\nOverall- if you like ramen, definitely come check it out.

It's not as spicy as I thought it would be but it's got a kick to it. Even when I think I'm super hungry, I've yet to finish a bowl of ramen and I think it's because I love slurping their soup, which is pretty filling itself. The ingredients are all fresh and just pretty typical of ramen shops. Obviously as you may have read, there are no take out boxes and that's most likely because reheating it would taint your taste buds from the ramen and also most likely because the soup would congeal from all the fats in the soup.

Take the hypebeasts rocking multiple hype brands in a fit worth more than your car payment, for example.\n\nMensho known as the first outpost of Tokyo's ramen chain, sets a high standard for ramen with its experimental flavor profiles, rich broth and modern approach. \n\nWith a line forming outside the small shop in the Tenderloin, took a look over the menu and noticed the higher end of ingredients being used in the food they serve with of course an A5 Wagyu option for $39, limited to 10 bowls a day. Opted for the Tori Paitan Ramen; chicken soup, pork and duck charshu, menma, kale, burdock root chips and katsuobushi paste. The broth is thick, creamy and fatty. Paired with the slices of charshu adds more fattiness and savoriness to the bowl. The burdock was a nice textural component and had a nice toasted, nutty flavor. The kale and menma were overpowered by the richness of everything else in the bowl. Ramen was thick with a good chew, but a little too thick for my preference and I'm a huge fan of curly and thick ramen noodles! The dish is so unctuous I felt uneasy. The broth is nearly a sauce instead of a drinkable broth, thick noodles and fatty pork and duck made this bowl of ramen too much of a good thing. Some acidity or brightness from another ingredient such as scallions or a lighter green would've helped a great deal. Ate half of my bowl and was just overwhelmed by how excessively rich it was, it was crazy rich.\n\nSmall shop with really close quarters here, be forewarned. If you have social anxiety and/or have issues with people being in your personal bubble this is definitely not the place for you. You are literally elbow-to-elbow with people and yes, if your ramen slurp game is not on point you will get broth splattered on yourself as well as the guy next to you. Service wise the wait staff is attentive and quick. Food doesn't take too long to come out of the kitchen and you can keep yourself entertained watching their process on the TV or to look at their decor. You can keep your belongings in a basket on the ground.\n\nPrice point is high, which makes sense for the quality of ingredients used and the compositions of the ramen bowls.

There were also big long tables to squeeze most of their customers inside.\n\nFood:\nI ordered the spicy lamb ramen and we decided to share the enoki mushroom chips. The enoki chips had an interesting texture. It reminded me of a potato chip and mushroom mixed together. It was tasty but I wouldn't say worth $6 for the portion size.

One of the best if not the best shoyu or paitan ramen in the SF area. \n\nWe arrived at 8:30 Pm on a Friday night and the line was about 20 deep. Wait was around 40 minutes. Staff is super attentive collecting party numbers in the line and accommodated everyone on a first come first serve basis. We were waiting for a table for 4 and even as double seats showed up, and though smaller parties were behind us, they took care to seat us first.\n\nThe menu is clean and easy to read. We ordered:\n\nOysters in shoyu dare oil - doesn't look appetizing, tastes like canned oysters in oil (not a bad thing).\n\nOrganic shoyu ramen with double chasu - this was DELICIOUS. I was opting for a less-rich broth so went with the shoyu. Great choice. They double chasu is an extra slice, totally also worth it. The smoky flavor of the chasu pairs well with the clean shoyu based broth. The kale was so tender yet held texture in the bowl, and I adored the noodles. Tender, squiggly awesomeness. The duck chasu is new to me in ramen, and added depth to the bowl. \n\nSpicy tori paitan ramen with double chasu - spicy isn't too spicy, noodles were a little different than the shoyu ramen (closer to typical ramen noodles). Broth was super rich, creamy, heavy and delicious. Some with duck and pork chasu as well.\n\nAlthough this ramen in general is much more rich than what I'm used to, it's GOOD. It's not exactly comparable but seems to me to stand In its own category - I've not had ramen like this before and it was so good.\n\nEgg isn't included and it's a must add for $1. A whole egg, perfectly cooked. $1 is worth it.\n\nParking and neighborhood is kinda sketch... but I didn't feel unsafe dining here.

I will break down each component of the ramen.\n\nThe broth was so rich and packed with umami; if I could, I would carry around a thermos full of it everyday and just drink it. It was hot, savoury, creamy, and really hits the spot, even in the summer. If ramen broth could give out warm hugs, this would be it.\n\nThe toppings... were a bit weird. I'm not sure why there were random vegetables. They didn't really taste like anything, and if anything actually distracted me from the part I really cared about (the ramen and the broth). They just tasted so drastically different and didn't pair well at all with the ramen, so that sorta killed it for me.\n\nThe noodles... were nice and thicc, just the way I like it. They paired really well with the broth, as the chewiness and thickness held up really well to the bold flavour of the broth.\n\nIt's not a perfect bowl of ramen, but it's still pretty good.

I should have asked, but it was a decent size bowl of fried enoki mushrooms, served with a lemon wedge and chili seasoning on the side.

I didn't even look to see what else was in there, but I THOROUGHLY enjoyed every single slurp. It had enough kick to it, and it was spicy for me but I didn't care. The noodles were fat, chewy and perfect in my opinion. I loved it very much. I finished almost all the broth. If I hadn't been so full, I would have finished the entire thing.

I was craving ramen today and since it was only ~630pm we were willing to try waiting in line today. We waited 30-40 min for a table of 2. If you're an SF resident, you'll know that Mensho is in the heart of Tenderloin, so waiting in line here is not a pleasant thing with all of the drugged up homeless passing by yelling uncontrollably. \n\nWhen we got seated, we sat down at the communal table squished in between two groups. We got the tori paitan and the shoyu. I had heard that the tori paitan had a rich broth but I didn't expect it to taste so thick and creamy. It was actually a bit disgusting. I really wanted to like it, but I just could not. It felt like they just threw a bunch of veggies that really didn't need to be there - the burdock root that they add really made the dish taste out of place - the texture was very similar to apple peels.. The noodles were thick and wrinkly and didn't really taste like ramen noodles - felt a lot more like instant noodles, which was pretty disappointing. I had a taste of the shoyu broth which was much lighter and edible than the tori paitan.\n\nThe best description of the tori paitan broth was a remark that I heard from the group beside me: \"is this even soup? it looks like peanut sauce\". \n\nSo.. yes if you'd like a peanut sauce soup with instant noodles and a bunch of random vegetables, try Mensho. \n\nAside from the food and wait, our service wasn't anything special. She asked whether my friend was done his meal pretty early in. The front door was also left open so there was a cold draft in the restaurant. \n\nDo yourself a favor and go to Iza Ramen or Hinodeya and you won't have to wait as long nor eat shitty ramen.", "author": "Elisa L."}

The space is cozy - sitting around 20 people in short segments of time. \n\nFor the Macca Tori Paitan - The broth was too heavy for my palate.  The Macca powder dispersed on top the ramen was great for show, but did not add much to the culinary experience as I consumed chunks of Matcha powder here and there - it did not blend well in the soup.  The chewiness of the noodle was fine, but the noodle width was a bit on the thick side. \n\nFor the Organic Shoyu Ramen - The broth was too salty. Again, the chewiness of noodles fine - the noodles were flat and thin like Chinese style Wonton noodles.  It was a good, but not an amazing bowl of ramen that dreams are made of. \n\nFor the Vegan tantanmen, the broth was too salty for me to handle. The chef was incredibly liberal with the salt in this dish.  The dish was thick and lacked a balance of flavors. I appreciate the use of mame, pea shorts and cilantro, but the vegetables were very much overshadowed by the thickness and saltiness. \n\nFor the Aburasoba, I was quite actually pleasantly surprised!

The Shoyu Ramen's broth tastes great at first, but after eating it for a while, it gets super salty, and makes you crave water. Their broth has a soy sauce like taste to it, while the Shio has a Fish Oil taste to their broth. I wish I ordered their Tori Paitan Ramen, which seems to be the highlight of their shop! I'll try it next time I come.

I really enjoyed the seven herbs that they had in the dish, and the noodles were pretty good as well. The dishes here are more expensive than your average SF ramen place, but if the prices reflect the quality of the ramen here, then the prices are well deserved.  \n\nAt the time of this writing, I would say that the vegan tantanmen here is the best ramen I've had in SF, and that isn't an exaggeration.

I've been lucky enough to get the last few spots without waiting. The place is small and fills up quickly. Seating style is communal, so expect to sit closely and share long tables with fellow ramen lovers. \n\nThe ramen here is different from any other ramen spot I've tried in San Francisco. The Tori Paitan was verrrrry thick and rich, almost like a gravy. I also had the Organic Shoyu, the broth was flavored just enough n much lighter that the others I've tried here. Both the Tori Paitan and Shoyu contained one piece of Chashu(option for double Chashu for 2$ more) and 2 slices of duck breast. The duck was soo tender and the Chashu was melt in your mouth. My friend had the Spicy Lamb...mmmm the lamb flavor was prominent and the combination of spices were just perfect. The noodles had a nice bite to 'em. Bouncy and cut on the thicker side, just how I like it.\n\nDefinitely worth the wait! Would recommend to give Mensho a try!", "author": "Mary R."}

I finally made plans to go on a weekend and arrive before opening to hopefully avoid any long wait times all together. Success. The inside is very tiny and clean. I can't imagine how a large party would come here, but I can't speak to that since I was just in a party of 2.\n\nThe ramen is delicious! A bit pricey of course, but well worth trying in my opinion. The bowl may seem small at first, but omg it is very very filling. The broth itself is a meal because it is so savory and meat-y tasting that I could easily have gotten full of drinking it alone. I think their broth and noodles are what sets this bowl of ramen apart from other ramen places.\n\nMy only tip is to plan ahead or come to wait in line when you aren't starving!", "author": "Erica C."}

Since it was 10 pm, the food selection was limited. I noticed Mensho Tokyo and got very excited because they have vegan ramen!! So obviously I had to drag my boyfriend to this place LOL.\nOff the bat, there was a long line. I believe we waited for 10-15 minutes, which isn't that bad. Also, I notice the restaurant is very small so that's probably why there is always a wait list. \nAnyways, we ordered their mushroom appetizer, spicy lamb ramen, and the vegan ramen (forgot the actual name lol). I absolutely LOVED the mushroom appetizer, it was 100% vegan but it reminded me of calamari. It was really good and crispy. \nVegan ramen: I first noticed my ramen was really oily. So, it didn't really look that delicious to me lol. I wish they didn't put so many nuts because it was really nutty. Their noodles also tasted a little weird to me? Their seemed to be a weird after taste of some sort? I still enjoyed it tho. It's just not that good for $18. \nSpicy lamb ramen: My boyfriend said it was okay. He also said his was oily. Overall he enjoyed it but it's just a whatever ramen.\nI've noticed that they don't have containers to go because I guess they believe that ramen is supposed to only be eaten when it's first served. \nIt is also crucial to leave a 15% tip, which I found a little ridiculous because I saw the waitress like twice within a 5 second time span?\nAnyways this place is okay.

The noodles weren't too soft and had enough chew. The broth was soulful and intense, but not too salty. The duck and pork chashu were treated so beautifully; I should've ordered double. They even paid attention to the bamboo shoots. You could tell that they either made their bamboo shoots in house or had some local shop bring them in.

Probably....not? 2.5 stars for the ramen and .5 extra for their delicious egg and their enoki chips that topped your ramen. I've been getting mixed reviews about this place, some say it's good because it's so rich and some say it's bad because it's so rich. I really had to come and try it for myself. \n\nThe line is a little intimidating but people don't really take that long when they're eating here, so it moves relatively fast if you're waiting for groups of 2-4. Can't tell you how long the wait is if you're waiting for anything larger.\n\nI ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen which I believe is their signature. At $18, it's verrrryyyyy pricey and it didn't even come with an egg. I recommend adding the egg even though it's extra, it's quite tasty. The broth is thick and very salty, almost like gravy. It was rich but not the good kind of rich I was looking for. The noodles were not my favorite type of ramen noodles, they were kind of like egg noodles combined with udon noodles. Thicker and didn't help much with absorbing the soup flavor. I prefer the thinner and more supple Ichiran noodles because it makes for a much easier bite, while I found it difficult to pick up the noodles with the gravy like broth at Mensho.\n\nGratuity is already included, is that why they don't care to provide you any service at all? For three people after gratuity and adding an egg each, it came out to $25 a person. WHAT THE?!! I can understand the appeal if you're into thick gravy like ramen broth, but it's not what I'm used to and it's not what I enjoy. If you're looking for a very different type of ramen experience, then I say come thru, but whether it's worth $25 and waiting 30 minutes or more?

After a mediocre first experience I was hesitant to wait in line and try this place again.\n\nMy friend invited me to try Mensho's 2nd Anniversary Specialty Ramen - A5 Wagyu Ramen and it was to. die. for. The wagyu was flown in from Miyasaki, Japan - fatty, flavorful and tender. Too bad it was only limited time and they only served 10 bowls/day over a span of a few days. \n\nNot only was the special bowl delicious, at this visit I also got a chance to try the Aburasoba which is a dry noodle served with pork chashu, green onion, menma, and the usual toppings.

By some miracle, I only waited 20 minutes to get seated for a table for two at 7:30pm on a Friday night, which was a great start.\n\nMy boyfriend and I shared a Tori Paitan ramen (extra chashu) and a Spicy Lamb ramen (also extra chashu - yeah, we're extra). Both were super flavorful but also very thick and creamy with thick noodles, so if that's really not your thing, I'd recommend ordering something else or going elsewhere for ramen. Ordering a Japanese beer with the bowl was the PERFECT way to cut the richness of it all, but if you don't, it'll definitely feel heavier than most ramen. \n\nToppings wise, the best part was the meat. The lamb inside the spicy lamb ramen was super tender cumin lamb with just a hint of numbing spice (ugh, I LOVE cumin lamb). The duck chashu in the Tori Paitan was a unique touch that was perfectly cooked, and the pork chashu was so tender that it literally just broke into pieces at the touch of my chopsticks.\n\nPrice wasn't unreasonable for SF.

For months, I heard rave reviews of the ramen here so I was ready to be blown away.  I came on a Saturday around 6pm I saw the long line which built on the expectation that the ramen was so good that it was good enough to wait in line for.  And perhaps because the expectations were so high, it was set up to disappoint. \n\nTIP: The place does not have many seats.  Smaller parties have a better chance of being seated sooner than larger parties!\n\nI ordered the tori pairan which is a milky broth from chicken bones filled with unique toppings like kale and duck chasu.  It was thick and hearty with everything one would expect from a good bowl of ramen but not to the point where I was trying to drink every last drop of broth.\n\nSince everyone else also ordered the fried enokki, my friend and I suckered in and ordered it.  The enokki itself is small stranded and when fried, all one really tastes are fried bits.\n\nThe service though is very fast and efficient especially since they are mindful of the long line of customers.\n\nOverall, Mensho has a solid broth ramen that is worth trying but may not be worth waiting for multiple trips.", "author": "Patrick S."}

My group and i arrived to the restaurant around 6pm and there was about 30 people lining up. The wait wasn't too bad for a Michelin recommended restaurant. Waited for about an hour and we were in and seated together. I ordered the Matcha Tori Paitan and was pretty happy with the order! The broth was really really creamy and thick but i didn't taste much of the matcha.  It was really pretty and unique so worth a try for $17. When i went they also had a wagyu ramen as well for $39 and they only serve 10 of those a day. Didn't see anyone order wagyu ramen but it was neat to see them have specialty ramen every now and then. The experience did take a bit of turn when one of our friends chewed out out piece of thick string in their ramen. The server explained it was used for wrapping the chasu and apologized and replaced the bowl right away.  But it was very unfortunate that she found a small fly floating in the soup in her replacement bowl...it was a bit ironic to have this happen to a Michelin recommended restaurant but i guess these things can happen anywhere. The server was yet again very kind and apologetic and replaced it with a third bowl and comp the meal for her. Luckily no finding in the third bowl! It was unfortunate this happened but their service and taste definitely makes up for it. Hope this will be a good chance for them to be a bit more aware and reflect to be more attentive with their food preparation even when they are highlighted as Michelin recommended.", "author": "Paula C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-29", "description": "So we heard a lot about this place and happen to be in town so we were really excited to try it. When we got there at 7:30pm, already the line was out the door. We waited for an hour and our appetite was building by the time we got seated. Being ravenous, we ordered almost everything on the menu.. we ordered the shoyu oysters, fried enoki mushrooms, tori paiton spicy ramen, and tori paitan with extra chashu ramen along with their craft beer Coedo Shiro.\n\nHere's the breakdown of the food:\n\nFried Enoki Mushrooms 5/5\nThe best thing we had here were definitely the fried enoki mushroom. They were meaty and has such great umami flavors and super crunchy. Yummmm\n\nShoyu Oysters 0/5\nThis definitely was not for me and it's really an acquired taste. The oysters seem to be cured in the shoyu leaving it in a kind of pasty and chalky kind of texture. It doesn't have that sort of plump texture that oysters have so that definitely kind of threw me off. Also, the brininess flavor was also lost and all you could taste was the soy sauce flavor. \n\nTori Paitan Ramen 3/5\nThe ramen was a bit murky and grainy.. and I don't know.. a little flat without depth of flavor. Or maybe there was too much flavor everything was kind of fighting each other so it cancelled everything out, which made it just.. murky. The noodles had a good bite to it and the soup was able to hold on to the noodles. The chashu was good, the best thing about the bowl of noodles, it literally melts in your mouth. Overall, I thought the broth was just too murky and salty, it was hard to taste the broth altogether.  \n\nCoedo Shiro 4/5\nI like it, it's very light and refreshing but it wasn't cold which was kind of strange. Cold beer is a must, so I had to deduct a point there. \n\nAll in all, our bill plus the mandatory tips came out to be $68 which is ridiculous for two bowls of ramen with appetizers and a bottle of beer. I mean yes I know this is SF prices but I wouldn't come here again to wait an hour for the food here.", "author": "Jean C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-02-26", "description": "For the longest time, I had Mensho Tokyo bookmarked at the top of my list. With over 1k reviews, this place is regarded as one of the top ramen shops in San Francisco. After months of trying to find the best time to go, I finally had the chance to check Mensho out with my girlfriend last week.\n\nTo describe our experience, I need to use a basketball analogy. For many fans, LeBron James is considered the greatest player of all time. To me, I find this debatable (Kobe 5ever!). But just because I don't believe LeBron is the best doesn't mean I do not respect his greatness.\n\nSo what's this got to do with Mensho? Before y'all report this review as irrelevant, let me explain. First off, I understand the hype around this restaurant. Overall, the food was tasty, atmosphere felt chill, and service seemed efficient. But, just like how I feel about LeBron, I didn't think Mensho was the best ramen shop ever. Nevertheless, I have to admit that this place was legit!\n\nComing into Mensho, I had actually thought this restaurant would have a limited amount of choices. In my experience, well-established ramen joints usually specialize in only a few dishes. One look at their menu and it was clear that I was wrong. Mensho has at least 8 distinct kinds of ramen - each unique in its own way. The broth that immediately caught my attention was the Tori Paitan; although I usually don't care for a chicken-based broth, I've heard amazing things about Mensho's rendition. For those of ya'll who can eat a horse, this restaurant also serves two appetizers and double meat/extra toppings can be added to any ramen. Plus, the list of drinks is almost as large as the number of food items! In terms of pricing, Mensho is definitely on the higher end. Ramen here can cost anywhere from $14-$20 not including tax+tip. \n\nI ended up ordering the Spicy Tori Paitan and my girlfriend got the regular Tori Paitan. Here's what we thought: \n\n-- GOOD, BUT NOT FOR EVERYONE --\nTo put it bluntly, the ramen here was great but definitely not what we expected. For both our bowls, the sheer quality of our ingredients - the texture of the noodles, melt-in-your-mouth softness of the meat, and freshness of the toppings - was unrivaled. However, when it came to the broth we felt like it was WAY TOO CREAMY. I LOVE thick af soup, but the Paitain broth tasted more like a sauce than anything else. \n\n-Spicy Tori Paitan (8/10): Besides the consistency of the broth, I really enjoyed this bowl. The spicy miso definitely added some heat (was sweating!), the cabbage was fresh, and I felt like they gave a decent amount of noodles. On the other hand, I wished that I got more than 1-2 pieces of Chasu - especially if I'm paying $20 (including tax+tip).\n\n-Tori Paitan (7/10): Protip for everyone...Tori Paitan is SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT compared to the spicy version. For example, the regular one has both pork and duck. On my girlfriend's end, she echoed the same sentiments I had about my Spicy Tori. Creamy soup aside, she really loved the Chasu (very soft and flavorful) as well as the noodles. \n\n-- SMALL, BUT HOSPITABLE ATMOSPHERE -- \nAlthough the size of Mensho was SUPER TINY (can only fit like 20 people max at one time?), the restaurant made up for this with a really welcoming environment. For instance, I loved the lighting, the decor was beautiful, and they even had coat hangers/boxes for bags that helped save space. Ironically, the bathroom was big too! My favorite part had to be the setup. Every table is essentially communal, and it may force you to interact with your neighbor; some may hate this, but I was all for it.\n\n-- FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT SERVICE -- \nEvery employee was super kind and very quick to respond. Even with the large crowds, we were able to take as long as we needed to eat without ever feeling rushed. \n\n-- LONGER WAIT THAN THE DMV -- \nIf you ever want to try this place you better get here BEFORE THEY OPEN (5pm Tuesday-Sunday). We stopped by around 5:10pm and still had to wait ~30 minutes to get in. Also, don't bother showing up with more than four people unless you have all night.\n\nWhen planning a trip here, I encourage y'all to take advantage of San Francisco's public transportation system because parking/driving around this area SUCKS. The restaurant is half a mile from Powell St. BART, and there are plenty of bus lines along/near Geary. I will feel bad for you if you end up spending 30 minutes trying to find parking and then having to wait another hour to be seated.\n\nAll in all, I find that Mensho Tokyo is really for individuals who love a super thick broth in their ramen - at least when it comes to most of their options. For me personally, I enjoyed my first time here. Despite the wait, it was worth it to say that I finally had a chance to eat at Mensho. But for the price and some of the nitpicky things, I probably wouldn't come back often. I give Mensho Tokyo a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating.

It was good ramen, and I could definitely taste the matcha but next time I will probably try something less gimmicky. I was also able to try the $40 ramen with wagyu.  Highly recommend getting it at least once (there's a limited amount sold each day!) - I absolutely loved it and the price is somewhat reasonable since the meat is so expensive!  \n\nOverall, Mensho is a good place to come to treat yourself and also if you're not strapped for time.

I heard a lot about Mensho and finally decided it was the perfect time to try it on a rainy day. My group got there at 4:30 and people were already standing in line. When 5pm finally came, we were able to get in as the first wave. \n\nIt was their 2 year anniversary and they had a Miyazaki A5 wagyu special! Anytime I see Miyazaki A5 available, I get it. Great choice indeed. The meet was so tender that I was able to twirl my fork and break it apart. The juicy fatty contents the lingered with each bite. It was a generous amount of meat too! The noodles were different from the regular noodles. It was shorter and chunkier which wasn't of my preference at the time. Watched my friend slurped up his ramen, which was thin and long. I tried my friends broth and it was creamy but not to the point where it was overly milky. I might just try whatever he had next time. The duck chashu I did as an add on was tender. \n\nService was impeccable. The girl with the nice wing liner, glasses and tattoos was awesome. Very nice and made sure we got everything.

However, I don't really think the bowl is \"line worthy\" though, given that there was a decent line and wait for a Tuesday evening. Inside is pretty small and they really squeeze people in here, so can feel a bit cramped / claustrophobic. Staff is very quick and efficient, and can come off as a little brusque. \n\nThey have a specific type of ramen, which is the paitan ramen which was mostly a very creamy, thick, milky chicken broth. The noodles are pretty thick and chewy, and have an eggy noodle taste to them, cooked very well although it does absorb the broth and get soggy somewhat quickly. Portion is pretty large and with how thick the soup is, it's a very filling meal. There are a multitude of toppings you can add on to your ramen in addition to what they come with, although they are a little pricey at $2 a pop for everything including cabbage and bean sprouts (seriously???).\n\nThey have other options on the menu including non-creamy ramen, as well as aburasoba which is kind of like yakisoba but not friend with the sauce. \n\nOverall a really good bowl, but I think a bit overhyped - I definitely would have loved it if I didn't wait 40 minutes for it, though.", "author": "Pam C."}

I heard it's super crazy when they first open, but I waited until after 8PM on both occasions and went by myself for easier seating. By doing this, the wait was always less than 15 minutes before I snagged a spot. If you go in a group of two, the wait wont be as bad, but if you try to come with more than that, then good luck - you might be there for a while.\n\nBecause the place is small, single eaters will be sat wherever there is space. That means if a party of five is having a dinner full of inside jokes, guess who's the creepy uncle in the corner quietly trying not to make eye contact. I didn't mind. Just buried my face into one of the best bowls of ramen I've ever had.\n\nFor food I went with the Spicy Tori Paitan Ramen with double chashu each time. The first round I forgot to order an egg, the second time I wasn't so careless. The broth had a good kick and it had an amazing creamy texture. The noodles were perfectly cooked and a little thicker than the traditional ramen that I was used to.\n\nI wish you could order extra noodles, but they have the food coming out like a well oiled machine. One bowl is plenty and you'll be sweating out all those amazing spices for the next 24 hours.

We got here about 30 minutes before opening and there was already a decent number of people lined up outside the restaurant, a sign of the huge hype for this place. We were able to make it in the first wave right after opening and were seated at a shared table with several other people. The space inside is fairly small but it seats a decent number of people. The tables are also very similar to the restaurants in Japan, with small cubbies to store your bags and belongings.\nWe ordered the fried enoki chips to share and I ordered the Tori Paitan ramen with double chashu and a soft boiled egg. They brought us our appetizer first to start before then preparing our entrees. The enoki chips were crispy and were pleasant to snack on, however for the $6 price tag I wouldn't get it twice.\nOnce we worked our way through the chips, they brought out our ramen. Upon trying the broth, you're hit with a lot of flavors as well as the thick/creamy texture. It was also interesting to see a variety of vegetables including kale and cabbage included. The chashu was worth adding, falling apart immediately as you pick it up or bite into it. The egg was a bit of a disappointment. It was marinated in tea and the flavor permeated the egg, but the egg itself was more cooked than soft boiled, unfortunately. The same went for my 2 other friends that also ordered an egg. I wouldn't pay for the egg again.\nDespite that, the overall dish was very filling and we all left in a food coma. Paying about $27 per person (15% tip is automatically added to your bill), it was definitely a hefty price tag as well as a very long wait if you don't come early enough, and for that I wouldn't come here often just to get my ramen fix. However, I wouldn't be averse to coming once or twice more to try some of the other options here.", "author": "Vivian Y."}

Still better than all the other ramen I've had in the Bay, I think, but the flavor was less interesting than the spicy lamb. It was less spicy and a good bit cleaner, with a less intricate flavor. It was still very thick though, and filled me up fast.\n\nThe ramen itself was easily five stars, but the line is awfully long and frequented by aggressive panhandlers. A system to allow customers to wait in a warmer, less-shifty place and be notified via text message would be greatly appreciated (Nowait, anyone?).

I do.\n\nMensho has shaped the way I think about ramen and completely turned me on to my obsessive search for good ramen everywhere. I've eaten practically every item on their menu now and still love it. The lines, yes, are still ridiculously long unless you get there just before 5pm or after 11pm, but it's worth the wait.\n\nMy favorites are:\n- Vegan Ramen: I love meat, but this vegan ramen is quite something. The flavors are not as \"heavy\" as the other favorite, the Tori Paitan, but yet it's still a filling meal here. It feels a little healthier too!\n- Tori Paitan: Creamy, rich, delicious pork broth; this one is a classic. It's mouth-watering savory!\n- Shio: If you're into fishy flavors, this lighter ramen for under $10 fills a lighter meal than the above two items and has a deep umami flavor. Not a fan of fishiness? Probably shouldn't choose this or the shoyu.\n\nThe only bad ramen I've had here was the worst ramen I've ever had in my life, but it was a temporary summer chicken and corn special that isn't a menu staple. I've tried some of the dry ramens too which are good as well, but not exactly my cup of tea (or soup for that matter).\n\nWhy Mensho stands out:\n- Ramen: has a lot of chew, and are thicker noodles to my liking.\n- Broth: deep, deep umami flavor that gives it the complexity many ramen places miss.\n- Meat: by far the BEST meat on ramen I've ever had. It's seasoned well, isn't dry at all, and they have both duck and pork options (both which are amazing).\n\nBasically, Mensho's ramen stands out in all regards.\n\nNote: They do not do takeout, they do not let you box home food, everyone who comes in has to order their own bowl of ramen, and sometimes they play very hyped up music which doesn't really make sense for the environment... but for the amazing ramen that hits the spot every time, I will deal with these minor inconveniences.", "author": "Joanne Y."}

The restaurant holds only about 28 spots, so the lines and wait for ramen are crazy! We waited for about an hour, which I heard was better than most, since the average wait time is 1.5-2 hours. After getting seated on one of their bench seats, they had a place to hang coats and a cubby on the bottom of the table to hold purses. \n\nI decided to order their organic shoyu ramen with double chasiu. At first bite, the aroma of the broth was absolutely amazing. Since I enjoy more of a lighter broth, I loved the warm, meaty taste of the clear shoyu broth. The noodles were also very interesting, and they had a thick yet flattened texture. The duck chasiu was also very tender and the chasiu was flavorful with a good amount of meat to fat ratio. However, I do wish the chasiu was heated up, since it was cold on my plate. \n\nOverall, this is a great ramen place and I would love to come back (if I feel like waiting in that line again).

The hype is real.  \n\nMy average wait-time here ranges from 45 minutes to an hour, but there have been times (generally past dinner time) that I just walked in.  The staff is courteous enough to run down the line to count how many people are in your party, which sometimes serves as useful evidence for calculating how soon and by whom you'll be seated if you're peeping through the window to see those finishing their meals.  The restaurant is comprised of a few long tables, so you inevitably will sit next to a stranger (unless you get seated in the back counter that seats 4-6 people).  \n\nThere are a few ramen selections, but I've only ordered the paitan broth.  It is extremely rich and creamy!  There is a single or double cha-sew option, which is just how many slices of pork your order will come with.  I always order the double cha-sew and add duck and a miso egg.  The egg is a must.  The yolk is perfect, golden runny and never overcooked.  The noodles aren't the firm-textured noodles that I've seen in most ramen restaurants.  These noodles are on the thicker-end and have a bounce to them--much like how pasta is al dente.  You will be equipped with a metal spoon the size of which is probably meant for scooping rice out of a rice cooker.  \n\nTo my recollection, there are only two appetizers:  deep fried enoki mushrooms and mini oysters.  I'd pass on the oysters because they're overly saucy, but the enoki mushrooms are very tasty!  I mean, it's a vegetable, so it's healthy even if it's deep fried--right?\n\nThe servers are all friendly, especially Kelani (her Japanese is on point)!  They seem to deal with the crowd on a daily basis, so they are accustomed to answering questions such as \"how much longer til we get seated?\" and telling customers that there is no to-go option.", "author": "Bonnie T."}

The wait was about 45 minutes on a sunday evening but that can't be helped bc the restaurant is pretty small and only couple of parties can sit at the same time. I got the 'spicy tori paiten ramen' and was $17 (not including tax or tip). Pretty pricy for a bowl of noodles.\n\nThe service is what honestly made this place a whole lot better as well. Despite everyone being agitated because they had to wait so long, the servers were very professional and kind. They were also very attentive when it came to refilling drinks and grabbing the check.\n\nAll in all, it was a memorable and a great experience.

Took me away from basic shoyu/miso broth and shove my face into tori paitan and changed my life. The creamy broth was incredible, rich, umami, warm, and comforting. Broth alone it got me.

Amazingly not salty like other ramen place, though I do drink a whole cup of water.\n\nNow is the wait worth it? It is and it isn't.

As a person who loves pork, I don't even know what I'm saying. But that tori paitan ramen broth made me feel like I was drinking a whole chicken--and yes, that tastes as amazing as it sounds.\n\nMy partner and I came on a weekday evening about half an hour after they opened. There was a line of ~6 people in front of us. We waited about a 30 minutes before being seated at one of the communal tables. I think some diners might be put off by this but in Japan, tiny, packed restaurants are pretty common. For me, it sort of added to the authenticity. The only thing missing was a vending machine taking my order instead of a cute, but edgy waitress.\n\nI think some people don't like this ramen because they prefer a thinner broth. I, on the other hand, prefer a very thick broth (like tsukemen) to coat my noodles so this ramen aligns perfectly with my preferences. \nThe chashu has that sort of complex, dark meat flavor that I love about duck. The broth was thick and very chicken-y while the noodles were the perfect width for holding broth. The texture of the noodles had a nice gentle chew to them.\n\nThe price and wait make expectations for this place super high. For me, it really surpassed my expectations so I definitely think it's worth the price. I haven't had ramen that was this good since Japan (travel not-so-humblebrag). \n\nTL;DR?\n- With ~1400 reviews, is there anymore that needs to be said?

We've said goodbye to our Indian summer in SF, so that means, pull out the chunky sweaters and scarves and head over to Mensho Tokyo in the 'Loin to warm up your soul with some incredibly rich ramen.\n\nThis is the first Japanese outpost outside of Tokyo and I loved that the owners chose SF. (why should NYC get all the cool places all the time?!) Years ago, I used to whine to my friends that I'll have to drive to San Mateo to get some fantastic ramen. But, now that we actually have choices, I can happily stay in SF and my friends don't have to hear my whining. \n\nFirst: YES. There is always a line. Come right when they open at 5pm or maybe closer to 11:30pm (but what if the soup runs out?) chances are, your wait will be less than an hour. There were 3 of us who waited around 530pm and got sat down in 20 mins. \n\nSecond: it's all communal seating. Most are high tops where you will uncomfortably balance yourself. So, leave the kids with a babysitter and don't bring big groups. You will rub elbows with your neighbors. You won't have much space for your said purse/jacket/scarves, but there are baskets on the floor where you can store them, just like in Tokyo!\n\nThird: get the Tori Paitan. Everyone talks about it, right? it's their signature bowl. At $16, you get rich and creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, Kale, Burdock and katsuobushi sauce. I love duck and I love that they give you duck here. Double up and pay the extra $2 for another slice of MMMeat. If you got vegan friends, say hello to their Vegan Tantanmen with made several types of mushrooms, nuts, chili oil, etc. in premium Japanese soy cream. You won't miss the real thing.

Most recently, I came because I had heard about their new matcha tori paitan ramen and wanted to give that a shot.\n\nI came right before they opened, around 4:45 on Wednesday, and there was only a handful of people in line. To be fair, it was a hot day--maybe 80 degrees--and only the most dedicated Mensho fans would even attempt ramen in that weather. The heat was definitely a barrier to enjoying the ramen; let's just say that I've been to Mensho many times but the lack of AC has never bothered me until this meal...\n\nBut was the matcha tori paitan worth it? YES it was! At $17 a bowl, it definitely doesn't come cheap, but I appreciated the subtle addition of the matcha to the already fabulous tori paitan ramen. Both my friend and I thought that the matcha flavor was very subtle and you had to stop and think about the flavors in your mouth to really taste it. Other than that, everything else about this dish is the same. The soup is still deliciously rich and creamy, the noodles thick and satisfying to chew, and the duck and pork chashu slices were perfectly tender. \n\nAlso, I want to call out that they offer soft boiled eggs now! Unfortunately it's not included in the base ramen, so you have to fork out another $1.80 to add it, but it is completely worth it. I'm just really grateful that they've started offering it here, since for the longest time they didn't. I've had a lot of good ramen eggs before, but even then I think the one at Mensho is one of my favorites. It comes as a whole egg instead of sliced in half, and when you bite into it, you can see the perfectly partially cooked egg yolk inside. Plus it's marinated perfectly and that first bite of the marinated egg white and half cooked york is really memorable.\n\nMy friend and I also shared the poke soba ($18) as we were intrigued by the 10 bowl limit per day, but I would recommend skipping this. Because it was called poke soba, I thought all the proteins in the dish would be seafood, but for some reason there was also chashu in there. It ended up being a weird combination of warm and cold ingredients (the soba was also warm). Also we underestimated how full we'd be from the ramen. By the time we both finished with our tori paitan and were ready to start on the poke soba, we were already feeling pretty stuffed...\n\nAnother friend ordered the vegan tantanmen as he is vegetarian, and he was blown away by how delicious and flavorful the ramen is. I tried a sip and would highly recommend this even for non-vegetarians!\n\nI know $17 for a bowl of ramen is really pricy, but I always end up coming back to Mensho time and time again for ramen.

Like damn, we buyin' the lotto TONIGHT!\n\nBut anyways, I've read around that this was supposedly the best in town and I can see why both visitors and local think that. I ordered their famous Tori Paitan and the boyfriend ordered the vegan tantanmen. The Tori Paitan was filled with an incredibly savory chicken-based broth. Your first bite will immediately hit you with a ton of harmonious flavors. Lots of umami going on here. Lots of toppings. Certainly a good bowl of ramen so I thought we were off to a good start. While delicious, have to be honest and admit we were underwhelmed. The broth was too creamy, too thick for my taste. And I know it's weird to complain about spoons but quite honestly, their spoon was excessively large and made the eating experience a little difficult. Imagine trying to eat soup but with a flat giant wooden paddle. I'm sure it was more so for a *wow/cool* factor. Minor detail though. I also wasn't feeling' the noodles either. It made everything feel so thick. However, I did think that both the pork and duck chashu were juicy, tender and generous in portion. Granted I ordered the double chashu, but hey, they delivered. The soft egg was perfect. And if you're fiending for savory, this will do the trick. As a broth fanatic, I had to try a few bites of the vegan one and tbh - it was bomb af. Nice spicy kick to it.

For me, the broth is the most important part of the ramen, and here I felt like the broth was overly rich, to the point it tasted like I was drinking chicken fat.

The downside of eating here is definitely the wait. We came the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, hoping most people would have left for the holidays, only to find out that its a prime ramen day... There is no sign-in clip board or anything - everyone has to wait in line. It took us roughly an hour to get to the front after starting to line up at 6pm. Luckily for us it was not too cold outside so the wait was bearable. Not sure I would wait a couple hours for this one bowl of ramen, but I have always wanted to try this place at least once.\n\nThe ramen was perfectly flavored - we ordered both the tori paitan and spicy tori paitan. The broth was very rich and filling, but not greasy to the point I didn't want to finish the broth. We also ordered shitake mushroom chips which were an interesting add to the mix. Everything meshed together - the chewy noodles, tasty broth, and fresh veggies. I wish it came with an egg though... \n\nOverall, ramen was bomb. Atmosphere was fun but seating/waiting in line were uncomfortable. I would come again only if I can find a way to not wait an hour for this ramen.

No, I probably wouldn't come back to stand in line unless I'm ok with the potential 1.5+ hour wait. It definitely seemed like other people didn't mind the wait since the line was always consistently long. Mensho is pretty small with 2 rows of communal tables for seating. \n\nBy the time we were ordering a little after 10pm, they had already run out of their soft boiled eggs (both miso and soy). Come early if you want to try their eggs! The add ons seemed to be a little pricy like an extra $2 for fried garlic or green onions. If you want additional toppings, your bowl of ramen can easily be $20+. \n\nThe Tori Paitan ramen ($16.50) has a rich and creamy chicken soup base. The broth was much thicker than your average tonkotsu broth - almost like a curry consistency. The duck chashu was glorious - so tender and flavorful! It was a little weird to have kale in my ramen, but hey it's SF, so why not. It was strange that they give you such a huge spoon for your soup. It was as big as a serving spoon or rice scooper. The Organic Shoyu ramen ($14) was packed with flavor too. If you're looking for something tasty, but less heavy, this is the ramen for you. The noodles were thinner than the Tori Paitan ramen which went well with the lighter broth.\n\nThey don't have to go boxes and you can't order to go, so make sure to slurp up all your delicious ramen before you leave!", "author": "Susan D."}

My boyfriend insisted we go since he's been here before, and he said Mensho's ramen is much like the ones he had in Japan. In other words, authentic. We went on a Friday night at about 9:30 pm and there was a line outside. It was about a 30 minute wait, which I didn't mind. Plus, if it's Michelin-starred, it definitely has to be worth the wait. They also have some of their ingredients imported straight from Japan. The place is very small but its interior resembles an actual ramen shop from Japan. Seating is limited so it might not be good for groups or families. However, if you still choose to come in a large group, you most likely won't be seated all at once and eat at the same time. One thing to note is that in Japan, tipping isn't required and sometimes refused. Mensho doesn't take tips either so don't be offended if they don't accept yours! \nMy boyfriend and I both ordered the spicy tori paitan ramen. I can truly say that it's the best and closest to authentic ramen I've had. The broth was thick and rich in flavor, which is exactly how ramen should be. The noodles were thicker than usual and much more chewy but I enjoyed it. The meat was tender and it was easier to pull apart in portions. Overall, the ramen was delicious and for sure worth the wait AND hype.\nIf you're looking to try ramen that is truly reminiscent of Japan, pay Mensho a visit.

I ordered the spicy tori ramen, which was not spicy at all, even with the amount of chili flakes in there. The broth was very rich and clung to the noodles. The ramen itself was also very good; the dish overall was just a little too rich for me and a little pricey considering the toppings.\n\nFor us, the wait time was a little more than an hour, which was not too bad.

There were about 20-25 people ahead of us. We decided to wait since we all wanted to try it together for the first time. \n\nThe place is quite small. 1 long communal table that seats about 18 people and 2 smaller ones that seat 7-8 people. \n\nThe servers were very nice and knowledgeable. They worked very fast, so the wait was not as bad as I assumed it was going to be. I figured we would have to wait over an hour, but it was about 30-40 minutes. \n\nI usually already know what to order when I go eat, but I really had NO IDEA what I wanted because nothing stood out to me. I also had really high expectations because it was Michelin recommended!\n\nWe ordered:\nEnoki Mushroom Chips- Good. I'm not even a fan of enoki, but I liked this appetizer. It was perfectly fried and salted. \n\nOrganic shoyu- Probably the best of the 3 that we ordered. It was a clear broth, so easier to eat. It reminded me more of an udon broth. It just made me want udon and tempura. I did like this the best of the 3.\n\nSpicy Tori Paitan- VERY RICH AND CREAMY! It was not spicy either. I ordered the habanero for $2 (not worth it), and it was still not spicy. I did not feel like I was eating ramen. I felt like I was eating pasta. The flavor was not bad, but after eating a few bites the creaminess became too much. I would definitely not be able to eat a whole bowl of this to myself. We couldn't even finish it!\n\nSpicy Lamb- Also very rich and creamy. I felt that this was even thicker than the spicy tori. This was my least favorite of the 3, but then again it can be that I am not a lamb person. When I asked for their opinion, they also said they preferred the other 2 more.\n\nSad to say, but this place is not my cup of tea (or shall I say bowl of ramen?). I've already heard from other friends that it's over priced and that it's not great, but me being me I had to find out for myself. Unfortunately, I agree with them.

The first time I came was during primetime dinner on a Saturday evening - the wait time was roughly an hour and a half. The second time I came during the weekday right around opening time and there was no wait time. The place sits just a little over 20 seats and is communal tables so you get real close to your neighbors, but it's typical for a traditional ramen store so get use to shrinking your personal bubble.\n\nI ordered their famous Tori paitan ramen with an added ajitama (seasoned egg), and as all the reviews say, the broth for this ramen is extremely hearty. It's not your typical smooth broth, but nonetheless I really enjoyed the depth of flavor. The meat pieces were very generous, it came with two cuts of duck chasu and two of pork chasu, and both were not majority fat, and if you're like me and don't like to eat the fatty parts of meat then this is a big plus! The ajitama was excellent - perfectly soft-boiled and great flavoring. One of the best I've had. The kale and cabbage toppings we're a bit questionable and felt a bit off from the rest of the dish, but it didn't bother me too much. \n\nBeing a Michelin recommended restaurant, it's no surprise that the price reflects the accolade. After tax and tip (which they already include in the bill) it comes out around $22. So is this a place I'd come to on the daily? Definitely not.

I thought I would be saved from the crowds and lines as I arrived at the 9 pm hour on a weeknight but oh was I wrong.  The lines was about 10 deep and when I peeked in the window and saw all these relaxed patrons talking and chatting I knew my stomach was going to have to be patient.  Good news is the people in line were super friendly and made the time go by but it's still something to contend with.  The fact is the place is tiny and even when they make you share tables it's still is going to be slow.  I also noticed that the staff was slow to turn over the table once a party left.  They could do better but there is only like 3 staff having to handle everything so it's kind of expected.\n\nWhile you wait in line you can look over the menu and so when you get a spot you pretty much can order right away.  In my case it's pretty easy as they serve one vegan ramen and that's why I'm there.  \n\nSo first off plan to spend a dime to get a basic ramen.  You are going to be out $20 without even making an additions.  They do provide extras also but they are pretty pricey at $2 a piece.  I decided to do a couple add-on's crushed habaenros and burdock since I've never seen that as an option before.\n\nOnce you get to your table they are quick to take your order which was nice after the long waiting.  Food came out 15 minutes later and I will say it's a beautiful looking bowl of ramen.  It looks very different than what you typically see at other places.  It's very creamy and white due to the fact that they use lots of nuts in making the broth.  They also drizzle chili\noil on top so it looks stunning.\n\nTaste it's very flavorful and rich.  I wish there was more veggies in the bowl since you are getting no meat but having added the burdock was a plus.  If you get the habaneros just remember those suckers are hot.  I'm a hot head and I could not even use up half of the bowl so I handed it out to others who were no all that appreciative of the jester:)\n\nOverall it's a fun place to try and I would say it's a good bowl of ramen but it is a little richer in taste than I am used to.  I wanted to actually take some home but they provide no to go options here.  I'm happy a finally got to see what all the hype is about and I was glad to be able to try out this unique bowl of vegan goodness.", "author": "Ron K."}

Their menu was rather simple, if you enjoy a thick creamy broth that itself might serves as a standalone meal, go with the Tori Paitan, which was as fulfilling as you could imagine. If you are like me, prefer something that is slightly lighter and go well with the noodles, I would suggest Shio or Shoyu, both made with clear soup base. I went a step further by ordering the veggie Dandan ramen, which was recommended by the chef as their \"best\", while added the duck slices. \n\nUnfortunately they stopped supplying the soy-marinated eggs, and according to the chef, it was due to the concern of egg quality in US. Ok totally with him, I'd rather skip the whole thing if it was no good.\n\nLastly, noodles - this is the best part! Very different from the traditional instant noodle type, the noodles here were thick, chewy, and tasted hand-made! Felt to me that they had absorbed the broth so very flavorful as well!

Although I was skeptical about trying it, I now understand why this place is so popular.\n\nFood:\nI've tried the Tori Paitan Ramen and Spicy Lamb Ramen. The noodles are incredibly fresh and flavorful . The broth for the spicy lamb has a similarity with Indian curry. Another note is that the broth is very creamy and has amazing flavor! The spice level of the spicy lamb is very mild, so unless you have an extremely  low spice tolerance you'll love it.  I think I prefer the spicy lamb over the Tori Paitan but either one is a good choice! \n\nService:\nThe waitresses are great at answering your questions and giving recommendations. But for some reason once I got my ramen I was never checked on or asked for water refills until the end but it wasn't a big deal for me. Today I got a seat that has the view of the kitchen. While I was waiting for my order I was watching the cooks work and it was amazing to see how a Michelin-starred restaurant operates in the kitchen. The way that the team in the kitchen works together and perfectly times everything is just outstanding. \n\nWait times:\nThey open at 5pm so I suggest you get their at least a half hour before. For example I showed up at 4:25pm and was the fourth person in line. At 4:50pm there was about 20 people behind me. So, show up early to get into the first wave of seating. If you have a party, make sure everyone is there or else they won't seat you. But you can try your luck and ask the waitress if you can order for the people that aren't here yet. \n\nPrice:\nI paid somewhere between $19-$20 for Spicy Lamb Ramen.

Actually I think the longest time I was waiting for was probably 30 minutes, but we went at around 5 - 6PM so maybe that's not dinner time yet for most people? \n\nAnyway, the first time I came in, I ordered Spicy Tori Paitan and it was AMAZEBALLSSS. It was so creamy and rich, almost weird to look at when they first place the bowl down. It looked as though you're eating ramen in a bowl of milk, but once you get a sip, you just want to keep on going! \n\nThe second time, I ordered the same thing even though I was tempted to order the Vegan one. Finally, my third time, I went for it and got the Vegan one and man, I am coming back FOR SURE. To think the Spicy Tori Paitan was rich and creamy, the vegan was BEYOND what I could've imagined. I was having a mouth orgasm. It was DELIGHTFUL! The taste was exquisite and enticing. I've never had anything like it. Just one bowl itself was enough to fill me up. The noodles were cook perfectly as it's not super soft. I like my noodles on the more firmer side, ya know waaa I mean? \n\nIf you're thinking of something else rather than the noodles....I got nothing to say to you, you DIRTY MINDED people!!\n\nAnyhow, I am smitten with this place despite the small capacity and close proximity you have to be with people, but hey, you're in SF, get used to it!", "author": "Anna L."}

Luckily I was with someone I enjoyed talking to past the time!\n \nI tried three different broths - all in the creamy style. Mensho stands out for the thickness of their broth. It's not the thickest I've had - that was at Muteppou in Osaka (we are talking almost pudding), but it's the thickest I've tried in the states. \n\nI've come to realize thick broth is not my thing. I like rich flavors, but I don't want clam chowder texture when I'm eating noodles. Make sense?\n \nThickness aside, the broth flavors were great. My favorite was the Spicy Lamb, though it was way too salty and actually not that spicy. The flavor was unique for ramen - very peppery and heavily spiced.\n \nThe popular Tori Paitan was milder in flavor, with a very rich and creamy broth similar to Tonkatsu but not as 'meaty' in taste. If you like simplicity at its best, this is the way to go.\n \nI usually stay away from veggie bases, but I was surprised at how much I liked the Vegan Tantanmen! The mushroom and kombu broth had so much umami, it was ridiculous. The chili oil and nuts added a nice dimension. This will be my next order if I revisit.\n \nAs for the meats, the pork chashu and duck chashu were tender, but forgettable for me. I did like the hearty portion of ground lamb. The noodles were good - nice chew and springy texture.\n \nI enjoyed the Fried Enoki Mushroom appetizer. It's a heavier amount of batter, but it crunches so pleasingly.

That said, the noodle quality here is probably the best I've had - great chewy texture and definitely handmade. \n\nThe broth is very rich, creamy, and thick - I prefer a lighter and more soupier broth. My fiance got the lamb ramen ($16) - explosion of flavor but also very salty and heavy. I tried the vegan ramen ($18) which was a little lighter but still pretty thick as far as ramen broths go. The flavors were nice - peanut/ nuts and soy mixed in with a little kick of heat. I liked the toppings - edamame, kale sprouts, green onion, and mushrooms. The added poached egg is a must - cooked perfectly. Definitely one of the better vegan ramen's I've had. \n\nThe space is pretty tight with communal tables and bench seating. The crowd usually lines up prior to opening at 5pm so get here early if you want to be part of the first wave. By the time I went (around 4:45) there was already a good amount of people and I ended up just missing the first seating and waiting a little over an hour to get seated. \n\nMaybe I'll come back to try the tori paitan ramen but it'll have to depend on the line which is pretty bad during prime dinner hours.

I also like this broth because it wasn't very heavy like the broth in the vegetarian. We also got the two appetizers. The oysters were not good and I love oysters. Again something to do with the marinate. I really liked the mushroom appetizer though. Sooo I'm sorry to those who wait outside in line to get into this place but I'm rating it just ok :/ oh also this is important... they DO NOT have to go boxes. I pretty much wasted all mine because I didn't know this. You can bring your own Tupperware I was told. Not convenient", "author": "Sam P."}

My takeaways:\n\nPROS:\n- Chashu is melt-in-your-chopsticks tender\n- Noodles were thick, curly and had a nice bite to them\n- Soup is like a chickeny-tonkotsu gravy. Rich and creamy, but you can still slurp a decent amount without feeling too gross. It has a well-rounded savoriness to it. One of the more unique ramen soups\n- Smoked Oysters are a briny delight. Get them.\n\nCONS:\n- Got there at 4:30pm on a Saturday (30 minutes before they open!) but still had to wait TWO HOURS in line.\n- The toppings and very top of the soup weren't steaming hot - just only warm. Only the noodles themselves were hot. I kinda wish the whole thing was hot.\n- The lights in the restaurant are super bright and were making my face all red. Given how the restaurant is laid out, chances are the person across from you is going to be a complete stranger. Most of the seating is on stools. All of this led to an uncomfortable dining experience.\n\nIt's a good ramen shop. I like it better than Ippudo - I feel like this is actually worth the $18 price point.", "author": "Gabriel H."}

But from the wait, we grabbed a bottle from the corner liquor store and drank in line like true BayDestrians.

Not only did we jump on the order and get peach sale (see photos) my company ordered the last of the clam ramen.\n (Only 10 served per day, which worked perfectly because although I don't eat meat I'm a pescetarian so seafood is good for me all day.)\n\nWe were first ordered and served oysters and they were tiny as hell, but deliciousAF.

The legend of this place extends far and wide and after hearing about this mythical place from the land of the rising sun where the ramen was magical and the lines were long. I had to have it. Now having tasted the fruit from said mythical place I can confirm that the journey, read wait, is worth the prize. \n\nThis place changed my perspective of ramen and for that I will give this place 5 stars. I have become alot more choosy with my ratings and don't give 5 stars anymore. But, as you will read below this place deserves it. \n\nI am usually known to not like ramen, but that turned out to be due to the fact that I did not have the right ramen at the right place. It kinda scarred me for a long time and I shied away from trying any ramen for that reason. But, that all is behind me now after trying this place. \n\nAfter some merrymaking around town we stopped by here on the eve of Christmas eve and the line was only about 45mins-1 hour long. So, we decided that today it was finally in our destiny to have that bowl of awesomeness. And that we were served with a smile by the people at Mensho. Amongst me and my friends we tried 3 different types of the ramen:\n- Spicy Tori Ramen: This is by far the most commonly ordered ramen here, and you realize that once you taste it. It has a smooth but very rich flavor profile. Once you mix everything it becomes pretty thick and tasty. If you have not been here before and want to try their most common signature dish then this should be your choice.\n- Miso Chashu Ramen (Spicy lamb ramen): No one can fault you for ordering only the Tori Ramen every time you have been to this place but if you like to have something flavorful and filling then I would definitely recommend that you try the Spicy Lamb Ramen also. It is also very tasty and the flavor is very different but equally awesome as the Tori Ramen. I had this one and was very happy with my choice.\n- Poke Soba: This is the Poke version of the ramen and is drier compared to the other ramen that are served in broth/soup. This had a very different flavor and the seafood was also very fresh and tasty. The thing that appealed the most to me here were the ramen. In India we get ramen like instant noodles called Maggi noodles. The company is owned by Nestle and is present in many countries in the world. The ramen in this one reminded me of those noodles that I used to have as a kid and brought back wonderful and fun memories. Apart from the taste, I might order this one purely for the awesome ramen that it has.\n\nAppetizers: In all the haste to describe the food I forgot to mention the Oyster in Shoyu Dare Oil starter that we had. It was also amazing and I would recommend to try it if you like flavored oysters.\n\nOne thing to know, the serving size is huge. It does not look like when you get the food but there is a lot of food here and the bowl is deeper than it seems. I am a tall guy with an appetite but I could not finish what I ordered. They don't give to-go boxes, you have to have your own if you want to take it back home. When we were having so much awesome food for a second I thought if it was just us who were having such a good time as we don't have a very trained ramen palette. But, then if you looked around and saw all the people instagramming, checking in on Fb and taking pictures of the food from different angles, it made me feel assured that everyone was loving it.\n\nThis is an amazing place and I am looking forward to going back here.\nCome hungry and leave happy and full. Definitely a must try!!..", "author": "Nipun S."}

So that's not the problem. \n\nI knocked off 1 start from their perfect rating because tonight's Shio ramen my friend ordered was pretty much bad. I always go with the flavorful Tori Paitan which is delicious but after trying my friend's Shio, Mensho dropped in ratings a bit. I also found out that they don't have togo boxes.

By 5:30pm we were seated and I ordered the Spicy Lamb Chashu Ramen. It was a BURST of flavors in my mouth: the spicy, the lamb, the chashu and the thick broth.

Knowing that there was hardly any street parking and that the area around it was a little sketch, we decided to take an Uber there (good idea). \n\nMensho Tokyo opened at 5pm, and we arrived there at 6pm on a Wednesday. Make sure to layer up, bring a warm coat, and be prepared to stand in the cold for an hour or two. The restaurant is very small and only seats 28 people. When we got there, the line (~50 people) was already extended two stores down from Mensho. I've never seen a line that long, but fortunately it moved more quickly than I expected. We were lucky that day and were seated after waiting for little more than an hour. I heard on some days, the wait time can be insane and can be 2+ hours. This gives you time to look over the menu and decide what you want to order ahead of time. When it was my turn to be seated, I walked inside, hung my coat up by the door, and made my way to the table. Seating is \"communal style\" so you'll most likely sit next to a stranger. The tables are high up and there are baskets underneath so you can temporarily store your personal belongings there. I also noticed they play fast paced music, such as EDM, but it didn't really suit the environment. It was odd, but after listening to the some Dillon Francis, I was even more excited to eat my ramen.\n\nMy two friends ordered the Shoyu ramen and I ordered the Shio ramen. The food arrived fairly quickly and all came out at the same time. \nSHIO RAMEN: It came with bamboo shoots, chashu, noodles, and kale. The kale was definitely an interesting addition to a bowl of ramen but none of the less, a great one because I like kale. The clear broth was delicious, which was perfect for me since I like it light. After one sip of the broth, I knew that it'd satisfy my ramen cravings. The flavors in the broth were distinct and I instantly knew that waiting in the cold was worth it since the broth was one of the best I've ever had. The noodles were interesting and different since it was kind of flat and thin. One thing that was a bit disappointing was the chashu. The chashu was barely warm and didn't complement the ramen since it wasn't the same temperature. It would have been better if the meat was heated up more and if it had more flavor. I also wish my bowl of ramen came with more broth because my bowl looked like it had less than my friends. I slurped all the noodles, devoured the bamboo shoots and chasu, and gulped all the broth. At the end, I was left staring at an empty white bowl hoping that more ramen would magically appear. \nAll in all, Mensho Tokyo is worth lining up in for. I usually avoid restaurants that have long wait times since I tend to grow quite impatient, but I'm willing wait here again. Hit up some friends (to make time past by faster), bring some small snacks (so you don't starve while waiting), and stand in this crazy line for a bowl of delicious ramen.

The line was way too long for an $18 bowl of ramen that was drenched in fat and salt.

We got the Spicy Tori Paitan, Oyster in Shoyu oil, and the soupless naked ramen. Both the paitan and naked ramed was distastefully thick and fatty. The taste was incredibly one dimensional in that I can only taste grease and salt. The oyster was also disappointing. The cooked oyster was shriveled up in the dark marinates on a tiny plate.

Came with 2 friends on a Tuesday evening around 5:20pm, and waited only about 35 minutes to be seated. Yay!\n\nOnce space is available, the waitress took us into the bar/counter table in the back. Seating is communal style here so be prepared to share some space. It did not feel crowded though. \n\nIf you're in line for a bit, they do have a menu sign at front of line so you can browse the food and drink choices. I was anticipating my dinner here and spent the last half of my workday browsing their online menu. I debated between their infamous toripaitan or shoyu ramen. Instead I opted for SPICY LAMB MISO ramen, since it's very rare to get lamb ramen in the US! Both my friends got the toripaitan and I got to sample some. Both were excellent choices! Go for the lamb if you want a kick of spicy flavor and rich broth -- the thick miso soup had chili oil drizzled on top and lamb was well flavored with cumin. The TORIPAITAN'S broth was also rich and flavorful, and less thick/creamy than other reviewers make it seem. The chashu of both dishes were very tender and melted in your mouth. My favorite thing was the actual ramen noodles themselves -- thick but with a bouncy chew. \n\nMensho was definitely comforting on a chilly SF evening.

It's an incredibly popular place and typically has around a 45+ minute wait so be prepared to chill in line for a bit before you actually grub.\n\nThe ramen here is one of a kind. It's very different than most places that I've been to. The Tori Paitan hit the spot! The broth was rich and bursting with so much flavor. It's a bit on the thicker side than what I'm use to, but that's because of the the way they make their chicken broth. I think they blend like actual chicken into their broth to make the flavor pop. It's great! It also comes with pork chashu and duck chashu -- both were very tender and juicy. It even had kale in it (definitely a Bay Area thing).\n\nThe enoki mushrooms were fantastic as well. I've never had enoki deep fried before. It was a yummy snack to eat before our ramen bowls came out. Crispy and bomb.\n\nGreat place for a ramen fix.

My cousin ordered the $40 A5 wagyu ramen as of 5/12/2018. They may change up their current specials and that one was only able to be served 10 bowls a day! Enjoyed everything about this ramen, a little on the saltier side but I would definitely come back to try the miso or the shoyu brotha next time!", "author": "Alex L."}

I've also had the cold chicken ramen (refreshing broth but very bland), and arubasoba (nice first few bites, flavorful but super oily). Not sure if it's worth the wait to you, but I think every foodie/ramen lover must try this place at least once!!\n\nTIP: 15% gratuity is already included in the tip, and all the servers share it at the end of the night--which creates a less competitive work environment for the servers but also allows them to slack off since they have guaranteed tips.

Geez am I super late to the party! \n\nI live in the neighborhood and witnessed all the noise and hype when Mensho first opened. 2 hour long lines before the restaurant even opens is what I gathered from most. So I decided the best option was to wait for the initial excitement to die down before trying it for myself.\n\nWell, I walk past it almost on a daily basis and I have never not seen a long line outside.\nTo be fair, the line isn't as crazy as before. I came on a Wednesday at 6:30 and waited about 40 minutes. \n\nWhat is there to be said that has not been said before?? Instead, I will address the haters that are giving out 1-star reviews.\n\nTHEY DIDN'T WANT TO ACCOMODATE MY PARTY THAT IS LARGER THAN 4! This restaurant has only 28 seats that are all on communal tables. That means that if you come here with 5 other people and get huffy that your 1-hour quote turned into a 2-hour wait, that is no one's fault but your own! They cannot guarantee that 5-6 seats next to each other will magically open up at once. Seriously, be smart.\n\nTHEY WOULDN'T LET ME SIT IN THE RESTAURANT AND NOT ORDER ANYTHING.\nYes, every person in every party must order something. Otherwise, you are just a useless paperweight taking up space in their tiny restaurant. The 60 people outside would agree with me.\n\nTHEY WOULDN'T LET ME TAKE MY FOOD TO-GO.\nThey clearly state that on the menu outside that you're staring at before you enter the restaurant. Many yelp reviews have stated this. The restaurant decided that this was a rule that was worth putting in place in order to maintain the quality of their food. If you want something to-go, Jack in the Box is just down the street.\n\nTHEY RUSHED ME.\nThere is a time limit they put on your party. 1 hour and you're gone. This is not the place for an anniversary date or to catch up with your bestie from high school. You come in, you eat, you leave. It's about respect for the restaurant asnd the people waiting outside. If you need to camp out somewhere, there's a nice bar across the street that is perfect for that!\n\nI HAD TO SHARE MY TABLE WITH SOMEONE ELSE.\nNo one forced you to eat here, did they?\n\nMY WAITER WAS RUDE TO ME.\nIn my opinion, I didn't see any rudeness, but I didn't see any incredible acts of service either. They are a tip-less restaurant-which is clearly advertised. The servers are there to take your order and give you what you need in a way that will keep their restaurant moving and turn tables quickly. They will get you what you need, just be patient. You already waited an hour for a table, you can wait another minute more.\n\nTHERE'S NO SUSHI!\n*punches you in the face*\n\nTHE RAMEN SUCKED, I'VE HAD BETTER AT IPPUDO/JINYA/MCDONALDS.\nValid reason, you don't have to like it. But please continue telling me your engaging story I'm SOO interested. *sips tea*\n\nI'M FROM JAPAN AND I'VE NEVER HEARD OF THIS PLACE.\nWell aren't you such a special snowflake?\n\nExtreme Sarcasm aside, I had an amazing experience. I didn't know Vegan ramen could taste like so. The broth was so creamy and rich, it was hard to believe it was made from nuts! The noodles were also so delicious and combined with all the veggies and mushrooms (those mushrooms! How!?), it made for 1 incredible slurptastic meal from the 1st bite to the last.\n\nAlso, if you haven't, try their draft beer! It is unique only to their restaurant and is extremely malty, yet still light & balance.\n\nAt $18 a bowl,  it is pricey for a bowl of noodles, but I say it was worth every penny. *burp*", "author": "Lanie L."}

They have a TON of broths, but the food did not live up to my expectations compared to other ramen places I've been to. \n\nGiven the space issue, the restaurant addresses it greatly, storage baskets below the tables, extra utensils in a drawer of the table.  And the cool thing is you have to sit with other diners too, so it forces you to get out of your shell and talk to your neighbors.  Service was super fast, and they happily let me add another item last minute.  Their workers and processes are on point so no time is wasted.  \n\nThe broths were only okay and I feel their prices are only justified because it's a restaurant in SF.  Their cha sue was not for me, but the duck and miso egg were the all star of bowl.  \n\nSome things did not sit well with me and I just had to take off stars.  \n\nOn the menu at the entrance there is a post where they charge a 15% service fee and tell you not to tip.  That is fine with me, but why?  What if I wanted to give the team an extra $20 if the meal was amazing? I would much rather them add the 15% charge in their menu prices and have a \"tip not necessary.\"  It gives the customer more freedom.\n\nI also don't think the fried enoki was worth it.  I did feel pressured into getting it but it's a $6 item.  Given that a thing of enoki is less than $1, and the item is just fried, it wasn't \"amazing.\" And I wouldn't order it again.\n\nThey do not provide to go boxes, and that seems like a decision from the owners to increase efficiency speed and cut costs down.  Given the price point and wait time, not fond of that.\n\nAdvice:  Find another way to address the 15% service charge.  \n\nLower the price on the fried enoki, or at least don't have your employees pressure customers by saying it's the best thing ever and you're missing out.  \n\nTo go box...", "author": "Nathan S."}

Overall, the dining experience seemed a bit rushed since you can see everyone waiting outside and start feeling guilty. The ramen itself was sub-par to me and not worth the 45 minute wait.\n\nThe plus side is that Mensho gives a good portion of meat to noodles and that the noodles were perfectly thick, curly and al dente. However, the broth wasn't hot (temperature-wise) enough for me and there wasn't enough broth. I think the noodles started to soak up the broth and it seemed like more of a noodle dish instead of a noodle soup. It seemed like a heavy bowl of ramen, with a very creamy broth, fatty meats, and thick noodles. Definitely a pricey, but filling bowl of ramen.

This ramen place we visited during our SF trip definitely did not disappoint!\nThe first night we saw the line was almost a block down so we decided to try here another night. We made sure to get there early so we wouldn't have to wait in line as long. The wait was soooo worth it!!!\nWhile in line I saw that the restaurant is Michelin rated and I perused the yelp photos and reviews on what would be the best thing to order.\nI ordered oysters in shoyu dare oil as an appetizer, the tori paitan ramen, and the bf ordered the organic shoyu ramen.\nFirst off, the oysters were already de-shelled, and on the drier side. But soooo good! I would definitely order these again and again! My tori paitan had such a rich and delicious broth. And besides the usual pork chashu, they also had duck chashu. Okay, I actually enjoyed the duck way more than the pork! Everything was so appealing to the eyes and stomach!\nThe bf also enjoyed his organic shoyu ramen. He said it was different from what he's usually used to eating but it was still good. I saw some reviews stating this was the best ramen ever, but that they've never been to Japan. I would say, for the category of atypical Japanese ramen, it's definitely very good. But it definitely cannot compare to traditional Japanese ramen in Japan.\nIf you're ever in SF, give this place a try! But be sure to get there early!", "author": "Cara Y."}

I've waited in longer lines for ramen so I was prepared to wait, however the ramen at Mensho did not live up to the hype for me. I ordered the Enoki Mushrooms Chips ($6) and Spicy Tori Paitan ($17) and the broth was TOO thiccc, a quality I've never complained about. The broth's flavor was good but it didn't amaze me. Additionally, the Spicy Tori Paitan only has 1 piece of pork chashu while the non-spicy Tori Paitan comes with duck chashu and pork chashu for a cheaper price ($16.5)... The noodles were okay, definitely fresh and the Enoki mushroom chips were great -- I'd recommend those! \n\nWhile I did appreciate the organic chemistry on the walls explaining their ramen's umami taste, the overall ambiance felt a bit disheveled. I understand space is limited in SF, but man you're really shoulder to shoulder with your fellow Mensho-goers once you're seated. I didn't know I could feel more claustrophobic inside a restaurant than waiting in line haha. Also, when I was getting seated throwback Pussycat dolls (Buttons) was playing and while it was humorous, it was not appetizing.

The cause of this dilemma is probably due to the overly heavy style of broth that mensho offers. \n\nWhile I love hearty broths, I found mensho's classic tori paitan too heavy. It's hearty to the point of being sickly. When you get through 2/3 of the bowl, it will feel like plowing through a bowl of cream of mushroom + noodles. It's a guaranteed food coma for days if you finish the entire bowl. \n\nIt's funny because you can tell by watching the faces of the customers who finish their meal that they are done for the day by the time they finish. I know because I've closely observed the expressions of those who've finished their meals while waiting in the infamous 1-2 hour mensho ramen line. Their faces said \"I'm so stuffed I could burst - time to continue with the rest of my day inebriated.\"\n\nIf you like thick ramen, definitely pay mensho a visit.

While the wait might not be worth it if you're coming at peak periods and are already hungry, the experience here is definitely worth it if you can come about 15-30 minutes before opening, or later at night when things slow down a bit.\n\nIf you get here when they open, then go all out for one of their limited items, like their clam butter chashu ramen, which sells out fast. All the ingredients, whether the fresh clam, the butter, or the chashu are quite good on their own, but together they reach a whole new level. Similarly, the spicy lamb chashu ramen is quite delicious, with all the individual ingredients coming together to form a lovely, rich, and thick concoction. \n\nThe only weak point here is the service, which skews towards the perfunctory and indifferent, which is all the more irksome given the mandatory service charge here.

Apparently, this is a pretty popular ramen restaurant in SF?!! \n\nWe waited exactly 1.5 hrs to be seated and served. Mind you, we never wait for anything but the yelp reviews convinced us to stay..

Also ramen noodles are thick and good quality. \n\nAnyways, I got the spicy lamb ramen with double cha shu and my buddy got the matcha ramen. Spiciness =6.5/10. It's a little bit more spicy than mild, but nothing drastic. Leaves a little heat in your mouth as you're finishing up the bowl. Also lamb meat is grounded up like ground beef. \n\nAs for the matcha ramen, it's good/ok and creamy but don't expect it to taste sweet like matcha green tea. It's a little bland and has somewhat like a dairy taste, but I doubt they use dairy. Matcha is heavy on creamy side but not bitter like the strong baking matcha.

It's hard to finish the bowl of ramen, but if you do, you'll be stuffed as it's heavy on your stomach. \n\nWe also tried the fried mushrooms and it had a very good texture and flavor. \n\nIf you like ramen and don't mind the wait, this is the place for you.", "author": "Michael D."}

Be prepared to wait... outside and no leftovers are allowed to be taken home. Trust me it's all worth it. We ended up waiting a little over 30 mins to get in which wasn't bad just cold. \n\nWhen we showed up there was already a line outside with about 10 people ahead of us. It's a very small restaurant holding only 26 people in communal style seating. Yes you are elbow to elbow with strangers so don't be shy! They have baskets underneath the tables to store coats, bags or scarves. They also have coat hooks next to the front door. The stools are not great for purses ladies so you can use the notch at the edge of the table to slip your phone or purse into. Or just toss it into the baskets below your feet. Service was great and speedy! They have one vegan option here which I of course opted to get. My BF went with their Tori Paitan double cashu non spicy he didn't realize there was a spice option. It was made with a creamy chicken broth topped with duck and pork cashu. He really enjoyed the tenderness of the meat it was not overly cooked or dried out. The soup was creamy and smooth with huge flavors. He added a miso egg for extra. The miso egg is sweeter than the soy egg. If you are not familiar with these eggs they are soft boiled the center will be slightly undercooked and runny. My vegan ramen was amazing! It's truly difficult to find a good strong robust flavored vegan or vegetarian ramen. The thing that stood out about this vegan ramen was the 7 types of nuts added into the ramen. That was a first for me. It did add another dimension of texture, next to creamy rich thick broth and soft noodles. I love spice and the chili oil added a delicious kick of heat without killing my taste buds. I opted to add the soy sauce egg into my ramen. I liked both the miso and soy eggs. It wasn't packed with vegetables which is what I prefer. But that didn't stop me from loving this ramen. It was absolutely delicious! \n\nDefiantly worth coming to get again.

Ramen here is tasty and it's nice that the Ramen craze is finally hitting San Francisco albeit at this very slow pace - but Ramen in Japan is not something which is meant to take a long time. It's Ramen, you can bring the check with the bowl, OK? And if someone wants something else, you can just add it to the check. Let's do this people. Let's make it happen. As I stood there, I wondered why the people inside were sitting there so long. Were they being real cool, hanging out in the place to be? As I eventually sat there, I realized they were literally just waiting for the check. I realized the people were done with their food, waiting for their food or waiting for whatever. All of which, in a Ramen restaurant like this should be moving a lot faster. I know I wanted my Ramen, and then after my Ramen, was ready to bolt. Yet I sat there, looking at the line outside.\n\nI don't want to sound like a bozo or another one of the 'I've been to Tokyo' crowd, but I've rarely seen a line for Ramen in Tokyo and on the two or three occasions I did you know that line went FAST. The Ramen came FAST and is equally as good if not better so let's speed it up here guys. I guess I just had to wonder if they were going slow here in order to have a line outside, thereby upping their status with the herd.\n\nBut then I saw another line last night at Ippudo. idk, either we need more ramen places or the herd has to stop twattergram trending about being real cool at every new place. But maybe I'm just old school like that and Ippudo is the new place to have a line? Is Mensho missing out on the line action these days? Someone should open a new Ramen spot with a baked in requisite wait of 'up to' 1 hour.", "author": "E C."}

Known for its Tori Paiten(Chicken Stock Ramen), there is almost always a line at any given moment.\n\nMy friend and I came at around 6pm on a Thursday night. We expected the line to be a bit shorter since it wasn't the weekend, but lo and behold there was a line. We waited around 20-30 minutes for a table for two. Something to note here is that this restaurant is extremely small. There aren't very many tables, and the long tables often have parties unrelated sitting next to each other.\n\nOne note of the service here at this point: The waitress who served us would keep coming by asking if we were ready to order yet. I understand if it was every minute or so, but the waitress came so often it felt incessant, as if we needed to order as quickly as possible so we can leave as quickly as possible.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil, Tori Paiten Ramen With Double Chasu(Duck and pork chasu), and the Matcha Tori Paiten Ramen (Tori Paiten Ramen with Matcha all over).\n\nThe Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil was unexpectedly very delicious. There was different layers of flavor but every flavor was deep and tasty. The price might have been a little much for this appetizer, but it is something that I can definitely recommend to others.\nThe Tori Paiten Ramen with Double Chasu was certainly an experience. In my opinion, they really try to showcase the chicken broth. The chicken broth to me was a turn off. It was certainly very rich and creamy, but maybe too much so. It was too rich, creamy, and frankly heavy & salty. I've had my fair share of rich and creamy broths, but this one felt a little excessive. The toppings were rather generic besides the duck chasu which I thought was very delicious. I've never had duck chasu before so when I had it here, it was a tasty surprise. Overall, I can understand why some people would enjoy this broth, but to me, it's a bit much.\nThe Matcha Paiten Ramen was really no different. I don't believe the Matcha added any type of flavor difference and it fact, if I had to choose whether or not it made the ramen better or worse, I think it made the ramen worse. The matcha certainly made the ramen look very novel however.\n\nOverall I find myself difficult going to Mensho Tokyo again. The prices are pretty outrageous and if you're coming here to try the tori paiten ramen and you aren't a fan of heavy or thick broths, then this place is not the place to be. If you simply want to be part of the hype, then by all means, but I'd rather take my ramen hopes elsewhere.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

Ramen is one food you'd expect to never have to wait this long for. If you've ever been to a ramen house in Japan, you know what I mean. You walk in, order, and almost immediately a enjoying a hot bowl, and walk out, it's a popular quick lunch option. My experience on a Sunday night was quite different. \n\nI can't say that the service was bad, because it wasn't. Once we sat down we almost immediately had our food. This huge wait to get in however is what makes me question the hype. We waited outside for probably 100 minutes. They don't rly have the best seating plan, so sometimes bigger groups at the front of the line end up waiting longer for space to clear up, than if there had been a space available for say 2 people in the middle of the line.  \n\nAll in all the food was pretty good. I really enjoyed the spicy lamb with double chashu I ordered. The broth was pretty thick and more like a curry and than a ramen soup base. Still flavors were great and plenty of noodles and meat to leave me satisfied. The whole umami thing i rly dont get. Maybe my taste buds are challenged or i lack culture to understand taste profiles, but jesus its a bowl of noodles ppl. Sure some ramen is better than others, but I don't think any bowl will ever be worth a 2 hour wait.... but that's me. \n\nOverall Mensho dishes up some great ramen that appeals more to the droves of hipsters than your typical joint. If they can save up and rent out a new spot with more seating I'd be back. I would not return for the sole reason that I'd rather not wait for over an hour for a bowl of noodles.", "author": "Giff D."}

No other place in the Bay Area has a tori paitan style ramen as rich and delicious as Mensho. The meat in the ramen is cooked to perfection, both the duck and the pork chasu. The duck was perfectly cooked and tasted super juicy and flavorful. The pork chasu was so tender that my chopsticks would break apart the meat as I tried to grab it - absolutely amazing. Can't stress enough how incredible both the duck and chasu were, especially the duck.\n\nIf you want a lighter broth I'd recommend getting their Shoyu ramen - in my opinion it's just as good as the tori paitan but lighter in taste. Their Shoyu ramen is also one of the best I've had. Usually I hate ordering Shoyu based ramen because at most places it tastes like they just dumped soy sauce into water. At Mensho it's totally different and the Shoyu flavor is delicately finessed with all the other ingredients, creating a less punchy soy sauce taste. \n\nThis is my favorite ramen spot in SF.

My social calendar may not be as packed these days, but that's not exactly how I want to spend my time either!\n\nAlthough the initial craze has died down a bit, the wait at Mensho can still approach two hours during peak times.  Thankfully, we were able to beat the rush and only had to wait about 25-30 minutes at 6:00pm on a Friday, but the line was pretty long by the time we left.  Sadly, our group was also forced to split in half, but it was understandable - with just a handful of communal tables and some counter seating, they can't easily accommodate large groups.\n\n-- OYSTERS in Shoyu Dare Oil (3 Pieces)...$5\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mensho-tokyo-san-francisco-2?select=dl2NqklWfTa36XWtThxdTw)\nIt may not have been the prettiest oyster dish to look at, but it tasted pretty good!

Yum!\n\n-- TORI PAITEN RAMEN (with Double Chashu) - Rich and Creamy Chicken Soup, Pork Chashu, Duck Chashu, Menma, Kale, Burdock, Katsuobushi Sauce...$18\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mensho-tokyo-san-francisco-2?select=6oCdgfNJO79TLqfYAku5jQ)\nWhile I still wish they had their tonkotsu ramen on the menu, this was great!  The kale was kind of odd, but I liked how well the noodles were cooked, how tasty the pork chashu was, and how tender the duck one was.  The broth was the star though - as advertised, it was super rich, creamy, deep, and very flavorful.\n\nBeyond how good the food was, the service was just as awesome.  Orders came out very quickly and the workers were all super friendly, which was especially notable given how hectic this place can get.  If you want to avoid said lines, you can also try coming in for a late bite (they're open until 11:30pm, or so).  That is, if you're willing to gamble a bit, as they can run out of broths (and will shut down earlier than posted if they are completely out).\n\nThough I'd certainly come back for the Tori Paiten Ramen again, I'd especially like to return to check out the additions they've made to their menu in the time since I came here (like their lamb ramen, which sounds very interesting).

The noodles were cooked to a perfect texture, the bamboo shoots and kale were a nice touch, but what was the crown on top was the EXTREMELY TENDER and flavorful chashu. Both the pork chashu and duck chashu were out-of-this-world amazing! Definitely the best I've had in any ramen bowl. I only wish there were more pieces.  \n\nIn addition to the tori paitan broth, Mensho also offers organic shoyu, shio, and a vegan tantanmen. The shoyu and shio broths are lighter and not as creamy, which might be good for those looking for something not as heavy.

This location has been open for over a year now, but the long wait is still there. I came late Saturday evening (10:15pm) trying to avoid the long line, but it wasn't late enough. I still had to wait 45 minutes (only!?) and didn't get seated till just after 11:00pm. (They close at 11:30pm and there were people being seated all the way to the end.) I hate long waits, but the tori paitan ramen was well worth the travel out and 45 minute wait. On a positive side note, the restaurant was clean, the bathroom was clean, and their food safety score is 100.", "author": "Jean S."}

Don't come here for a date, because the communal tables make way for unsolicited conversations with neighbors and a complete lack of personal space. \n\nBut this is about ramen. And man oh man, while it is pricey for ramen, it was the best vegan/vegetarian ramen I've ever had. I didn't think Kayo Ramen Bar in Portland could be topped in that department. I'll be honest: in my veggie ramen dining experience, I've always just wanted a bowl of noodles, because the broth--the core of a ramen bowl--is never anything special. But this broth was rich. Flavorful. Fulfilling. If you're a vegetarian or vegan who wants a truly complete bowl of ramen, you're home.", "author": "Ashish B."}

After waiting about an hour, I finally got a seat (good thing I was only a party of one), and I was taken to a shared table setting.  If you are going to Mensho, you better be comfortable with sitting next to strangers, as you will be placed at a long table.  While the seating felt somewhat cramped, I did not mind the seating arrangement too much.  \n\nI tried the Tori Paitan, which came with both duck and pork chashu in a rich broth.  This was my first time having duck chashu, and while I appreciated its tender texture, I think I prefer my ramen with just pork (I tend to find duck meat to be somewhat hit or miss).

Seats are not open for very long, which I appreciate as someone who's hungry and waiting for food. While in line, we were able to peruse the menu and decide beforehand so we were able to order right away. We got the tori paitan (with double chashu) and the organic shoyu ramen. I liked the tori paitan better with the thick broth and rich flavor. I'm not sure if the double chasui gets you more pork chasui or more of the duck chasui or both.

I was trying to treat my friend Nick to a birthday dinner and told him to choose somewhere and he picked Mensho out of all places. Now, my BF lives across the street and I've never tried it because of the lines, again I hate lines. I don't like over hyped hipster joints and waiting in line for ramen is absurd to me because it's just ramen. As good as it will be, it'll just always be ramen (haters are gonna hate on me for that one). Anyways, I sucked it up and decided to take him there along with my bf. We got into line before the restaurant opened and we still waited 1.5 hours on a Sunday! Anyways, I see a sign for the special and it looks like wagyu ramen and they only make 10 of the specials a day so when it's gone it's dunzo. We all were like OK it'll for sure be all gone by the time we get seated as there were at least 30 people who ate before us. We finally got seated and saw the ramen special menu on top of our actual menu. I quickly asked the server if this was still available. He said there were only 4 more (I guess the $40 price point scared patrons away - woo hoo SF pricing). I instantly said, we'll take 3 (me, bf, my friend Nick) and he hurried to put it in the system. The ramen came out moments later (actually almost instantly) the wagyu was HUGE! Like have you ever been to House of Prime rib and got the King's cut? Well yes, it was massive and filled to the brims on the bowl and they gave TWO huge slices, nowww that justified the price. If they were going to give me some sliced pieces in the ramen I'd be annoyed but Ok, I'm down to spend that much on good ass steak imported from Japan and all. Now, I see all these complaints by other Yelpers about the broth being too rich and yadiyadiya and how they've had ramen in Japan and this isn't shit. I TOO have had ramen in Japan and to be honest, I think this was better - oops :X Food in Japan is actually not as salty or \"seasoned\" as it is in the USA. My sister who lived abroad in Japan has said that as well. But to be honest I like my broth flavorful and rich and fatty. I don't want no clear soup with some winter melon AZN shizz. Anyways it's all preference and I can't say for the other ramen on the menu as I've only had the special but if you want to throw down on the $40 ramen (and if you get lucky to be 1/10) then I'd say it's totally worth the wait.

Mensho Tokyo is a cute little ramen shop that offers all communal and bar seating with a capacity of about 28. This place is extremely popular, so expect a wait of roughly 45 - 90 minutes, depending on when you go.\n\nOf course, what we care about is the food, so let's get to it. I ate the Tori Paitain ramen. The smell and taste of the broth is extremely meaty. While I'm a huge fan of meat, I actually found it to be a bit too meaty for my tastes (which I didn't think was possible). The actual toppings - the pork chashu, duck chashu and veggies - were also pretty mediocre. What I found to be this establishment's saving grace were the noodles. These are some of the best noodles I've had. Cooked to perfection, these noodles are spring and soak up the broth like no other.\n\nAll in all, I didn't find the food to my taste so I won't be coming back for a second round.

I was looking at the menu when the Japanese tapestry on a metal rod that was loosely hanging above the podium came off the hinges because of the wind and fell on top of my head. The hostess was busy inside and when she came back outside and I told her what occurred, she simply said, \"oh okay, can you help me put this back up?\" Wtf. No acknowledgement and no apology given. I currently have a bump on my head and mind you, am now experiencing a headache the night of which continued the following day(today). What irks me is that she had the audacity to actually ask ME to put it back up?!? I was mad and told her I will not put it back up, so she asked other people in line to put it back up - which they did eventually. \n\nOnce seated, the waitresses were nice but still wasn't enough to compensate for that horrible experience with that hostess.\n\nFacility (1 stars)\nThe place was tight and barely had any room for my arms. I felt quite uncomfortable while eating.\nWhen I went to the bathroom, it was a simple design but expected it to be cleaner for a Michelin Restaurant. With the toilet paper on the floor, overflowing garbage container, graffiti (which could easily be fixed) you would think you are walking inside a bathroom at Walmart.\n\nFood (5 stars)\nThe moment you sit down on the table, you are given a menu and laminated paper in regards of their A5 Wagyu Ramen that they \"only make 10 bowls a day\" A friend of mine who was with me told me what Wagyu and the ratings (A1-A5) meant so my expectation was quite high when I ordered the A5 Wagyu Ramen. When I ate it, it literally melted in your mouth. It was probably the best beef I ever tasted. It really was worth the price and actually went above my high expectations.

If you want to make it the first wave I would start waiting in line earlier to be safe since anyone after the cutoff would have basically been waiting since before store hours open and have to wait for people to finish. Luckily we made it! \n\nInterior is small and seats maybe 26 people. \n\nI got the most well-known speciality, the Tori Paitan.  The soup is a really creamy broth, for me too heavy too drink but because of its thickness it sticks to the noodles well. However I would say the soup doesn't really have too much to a flavor to it; I prefer broth more with a shoyu taste. This ramen comes with menma (marinated bamboo shoots), fried/dried burdock strips (SO delicious and fragrant, was one of my fav things about the ramen that made it even better) and kale (tender with flavor goes surprisingly well with everything else). The ramen also comes with a slice of pork chashu which is super soft & just melts in your mouth as well as a couple small slices of duck chashu equally as soft.\n\nI recommend an add-on ajitama (egg) and they give you the option or soy or miso based.\n\nI really liked the noodles -they're thick and chewy with that \"Q\" texture.\n \nOverall very delicious and unique. Only downside is the steep price (but I guess this is the SF ramen price range) & long wait with fewer seats.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-11-29", "description": "Let me first preface my review by saying I really don't understand why this place forces you to wait outside its door in a line. Why not give out numbers? Customers literally cannot go do something else while waiting, and it's a big time waste. Why force wasting of (a LOT of people's) time? To prove what, exactly? I'm fine with waiting, but I'm not fine with a restaurant being so arrogant to force its customers to mandatorily wait in a line. The only reasons I can think of for this is: a) marketing - if there's a lot of people waiting, it must be good so let's convince even more people to waste their time to wait in line to eat at this place! and b) efficiency - if people are readily available, the restaurant can immediately seat people when a table clears out. Reason a is just selfish. Reason b can be solved by warning customers that if they're not there when they're called, they will be skipped over/crossed out. Or better yet, they can actually invest in a good technology system of calling/texting people. A bunch of restaurants have this, and I very much appreciate places that do. PLEASE change your must-wait-in-line policy. It's just selfish, arrogant, and wastes a LOT of people's time. Making people sign in on a sheet of paper or with one of the waiters/waitresses is fine; don't have to get all fancy with technology. But please think about your customers.\nI waited in line for about 25 minutes on a Wednesday evening; I got into line at 5:45PM and got seated at 6:10PM. I was handed a menu and my order was taken shortly after. I got the spicy tori paitan ramen with the spicy stuff on the side - I wanted it on the side so I could taste the soup in its original form. I forgot to ask for no bamboo. The noodles also took their sweet time to come out, but I know they were getting freshly cooked since I had a seat that was right in front of the kitchen. They have timers to tell the noodle person when to take the noodles out! Amazing. I waited at least ten minutes for my noodles to get served, but it was piping hot when it did and the spicy chili flakes and the jalapeno miso sauces were on the side. The soup was quite thick but not overpowering, and it was pretty good. I REALLY liked the jalapeno miso sauce. It was very flavorful and had a nice kick. I ended up using most of it in my soup and the chili flakes were more for show than anything else; they didn't taste spicy. I also really enjoyed the noodles; they were really chewy and thick, and they're probably one of my personal favorite ramen noodles I've had. I ate my noodles in about ten minutes though I did try really hard not to eat them too fast so as to enjoy them. I ate everything in my bowl except the bamboo. Oh also the one thick slice of chasu I got: very flavorful and a good amount of meat (versus fat). There were also fried onions which added an extra fragrant flavor and pieces of cabbage which added texture and a break from the thick broth. \nAt the high price of $20.99 including tax and mandatory 15% tip, I definitely expected more than one measly piece of meat. Also no egg?! The service was pretty good as the waitresses were all quite friendly (note: why is everyone serving the food a female and all the cooks male?). Good portion of noodles though.\nPlease get your wasting-time-in-mandatory-line policy changed.", "author": "Andrea W."}

The small restaurant only seats around 25, so we actually just barely made it.\n\nWorth the hype? Unequivocally.\n\n// Tori Paitan Ramen, Double Chashu ($18) - 5 stars\nMensho's signature dish is the Bay Area's best rendition of the classic tori paitan. The chicken broth was rich and creamy as it should be. The chashu was so tender that even chopsticks could easily tear it apart. The noodles were cooked al dente and had a great bite to them. This was just perfect.\n\n// 1st Anniversary Limited Ramen, Duck & Truffle ($35) - 5 stars\nThe most delicious bowl of ramen I've ever tasted. They are only preparing 10 servings per day for a limited time. You absolutely have to try this if it's still on the menu. The fragrance of the freshly shaved black truffles mixed into the duck broth was tantalizing, and every spoonful brought out the biggest smile on my face.", "author": "Miko B."}

It was very rich, creamy and flavorful. The noodles were a bit thicker than other ramen places. The ramen was a little rich and heavy for my taste. The broth was also very salty.

(I heard the wait can be up to an hour, but we got lucky by coming in around 8pm.)\n\nThe Vegan Tantanmen Ramen, as highly raved about and sounding DELICIOUS, immediately caught my eye. A creamy, rich edamame and soy-based ramen using several types of nuts in its broth delivered a FLAVOR bomb in my mouth! I've never had ramen so thick and creamy, with a slight spice to taste, and authentic preparation of noodles.\n\nI love the concept of Mensho putting care into their dishes to produce quality-tasting ramen prepared in a very traditional way. The $18 price tag for a bowl is definitely worth a try (can be higher if you add extras to your dish) as the flavors are incredible. Consider this an upscale ramen spot giving you quality ramen and flavors. I could barely finish my bowl but I don't think I've ever had ramen taste that creamy or rich in my LIFE... Definitely something I can't have everyday or on the regular.\n\nService was prompt and friendly. Got our meals out in a reasonable time as they are very efficient at trying to seat you and rotate customers around.

The wait is worth it! \n\nI've heard great reviews from friends about Mensho and finally had the opportunity to try myself. Everything on the menu sounded delicious and unique so it was a pretty difficult choice. I opted for the spicey lamb ramen  because I LOVE lamb (that's one way to choose, right!) My girlfriend and I also ordered the fried enoki (omg such a great decision) and we loved every single bite of it. \n\nFried enoki ($5) - aroma was sensational. (Tho to be fair, fried things generally smell amazing!) the earthy taste, omg, and crunchy crisp texture were soooo perfect together. \n\nRamen - Menaho is known for their ramen. I absolutely LOVED the noodles because they were chewy and thick. The spicey lamb ramen came with ground lamb, which I wish were thinly spiced lamb. I didn't love the ground lamb but did enjoy the how gamey lamb made everything else. (Am I weird for liking how gamey lamb is?) Soup was rich, creamy, spicey, and none of the tastes/texture were overpowering. If we were to put the spicey level on a scale of 10, I'd say it was a 4. The kick kept you wanting to eat more without stopping, because the instant you stop your tongue stings. I loved it! The soup base was the heaviest out of all the items on the menu and I am so glad to have tried it. I didn't realize how full I was from the noodles (carbs, yay!) and thick creamy soup base until I stood up!  needless to say I was ready to go back home and food coma \n\nNext time I want to go back and try the dry mixed noodles and will circle back with an updated review. \n\nP.S. \n- There are about 28-30 seats in the small space, split into for communal tables and one bar table area.

I was hyped about it as I loveeeeee ramen! I was warned to arrive early as this place always have a line out the door. But since my friend and my schedule didn't permit us to get there early, we got there around 5:30pm. Looking at the line, I thought to myself that this place must be good if all these people are willing to stand around in this neighborhood. As we got to the front of the line, we looked through the menu and saw a selection of different flavored ramen. Everything on the menu sounded interesting so we decided to each get a different flavor ramen to share. We also noticed a tip disclaimer by their menu posted outside that there is a 15% mandatory service fee added to each bill. \n\nWe got seated and decided to order four different ramens: Maccha Tori Paitan, Spicy Lamb, Shio, and Clam Butter Chashu Ramen. We placed our order with our waitress and as she was about to walk away I asked if they have Pepsi or Coke for my boyfriend. Instead of being polite and professional, she gave my boyfriend and I a snooty response, \"UH NO\". Okay?!?!?! Wouldn't be more professional to say something like, \"I apologize but our restaurant does not carry sodas\"??? But how dare you respond to us in that tone, those words, and in such a disapproved expression? Who are you to disapprove what he likes to drink? If you don't have it, it's fine but don't disrespect us like that! Is this what your mandatory service fee includes, being rude???\n\nRamen arrived! Each bowl was presented beautifully! We were excited to dig in! We each took a spoonful of broth to try. I had the Spicy Lamb, OMG the broth is not broth, it's gravy! It's thicker than gravy and I cannot taste miso. Isn't this supposed to be MISO? The chashu was not bad, it was tender but lacks flavor. I do like the little kick in spiciness but I wish it was spicier. Overall, I would not recommend this ramen as I like broth type ramen with flavors! My boyfriend got the Shio and yes it came in a broth but it was way too salty and again lack flavor! Where are the chicken and pork flavors in this broth? Was this just salt water with soy sauce for coloring??? And then guess what happened? The same snooty waitress came by with a pitcher of water and asked to refill our waters. She was pleasant when she filled my glass but when she got to my boyfriend, she didn't say anything and just reach between my boyfriend's face and his ramen with her pitcher and dripped water into the ramen. How rude can you be? Didn't even acknowledged what she did and just went off. I mean the water helped a little in diluting the broth but really?!?! Anyway, my cousin got the Matcha and it was matcha flavored! YAY! But that was it! The taste of Matcha powder sprinkled on the ramen! My bestie got the Clam Butter Chashu ramen. We all tasted the broth and we all agreed that the broth tasted the best out of ours.  It has a scoop of butter, we assumed, on top of the ramen but turns out my bestie said it tasted like sour cream. She didn't think that will mix well with her ramen so she decided to remove it. She did the right thing or her ramen will be ruined. At lease she got the best one out of all the ones we ordered. \n\nOverall, I was not impressed this place and definitely not going there ever again.

Parking, like most of SF, seemed about impossible so try to utilize a ride share company or public transit to get here. \n\nThe restaurant is tiny and tables are kind of communal, so you'll be sitting at a table with other customers. We were lucky and sat next to a nice repeat customer. After our 30-45 min wait in line, we wanted to try the store's specialty, the Tori Paitan. \n\nThe Tori Paitan was super rich, but I actually want to say it was too rich. This reminded me of Tsujita's tsukemen in LA, but as a broth rather than a tsukemen dipping sauce. It was rich, and almost greasy like a pasta sauce. Weird description, but I am not sure how else to describe it. The thing is, part way through, I started to have trouble finishing it. The noodles were a great texture, and the meat toppings were amazingly tender, but the soup really needed something to lighten it.\n\nBy the end, the soup itself also started to taste and feel gritty. I thought I was imagining it, but my friend agreed with me. Tsujita in LA provides a lime wedge with their tsukemen and it makes all the difference. The nice repeat customer sitting at our table suggested trying the soy sauce flavor ramen, as it is a less rich broth. If I come back, I'll probably do that, or try the shio.\n\nBottom line: if you've never had super rich ramen broth this is something to try, but shio may be a better option than the Tori Paitan. If the Tori Paitan was a tsukemen or had some acidity we could add to the broth, I'd give it 5 stars.", "author": "Kathy O."}

The place is very small only 4 communal tables so expect to sit close to other people. The service here is meh, not great but not bad.

In asian culture when you go to a ramen shop, you sit, you order, you eat, you pay, and then you leave. There is no time wasted talking and hanging out which american culture expects for any meal which is why this place typically has a terribly long wait.

The soup is very rich and creamy, its a little more overwhelming in flavor then I prefer but good. Its so rich it tastes a little grainy but it works. The noodles are well cooked and the right amount of chewy. The duck and pork chashu were flavorful and a nice addition. I didn't really care for the kale but its SF so not surprising to see it in there. \nThe ramen here was good but not worth the long waits or the prices they charge. If you don't mind waiting and want to try something a little different, then i'd say its worth checking out.", "author": "Peter P."}

I've been wanting to try Mensho since they opened early 2016 but I was too afraid of the long lines and 1+ hour waits. \n\nVisited on a Wednesday (1/25/17) evening around 5:30pm and got in line. It was about 14-15 people ahead of me. The line moved in batches, 2 or 3 parties at a time. The outfit is small with communal seating for no more than 30. While you're waiting a worker will step out occasionally to get a head count and party size. I was the only one there for my party of four. And I reached the front by 5:50pm. I was worried I wouldn't be seated since no one in my party was there yet. Luckily two more arrived before our seats were available. We were let in by 6:10pm so total wait was about 40 minutes. I was still missing one person. But Mensho didn't trip about it. That was cool of them.  \n\nOnto the food... we ordered the lychee nigori sake and enoki chips to start. Ramen we had the tori pantai x3 and the organic shiyo. The tori was amazing! The broth was so rich and creamy. It reminded me of cream of mushroom. The duck chashu was a treat. You don't see that too often. The noodles were chewy and plenty. Not al dente like many other ramen joints. But it still kept a good texture. The pork chashu was super tender and melts in your mouth. The broth was the biggest winner for me. It was unlike any other ramen I've had in the bay area. \n\nFinal thought: don't let the line detour you from trying Mensho. It's well worth the wait. And it moves relatively fast. Most diners don't sit idle after their meals so turnover is fair. Prices are bit high (ramen + sake + shared appetizer + tax/tips = $30pp). 15% service fee is included automatically on all bills regardless of party size.", "author": "Stephen Y."}

It's very well lit inside and there's a decent buzz of conversation.\n\nFOOD: SO GOOD! I'm the type of person who's willing to wait hours for good food so my wait definitely felt justified.

Heads up, there aren't any takeout containers so unless you can finish a whole bowl, bring your own container or arrive with an empty stomach.\n\nSERVICE: I understand that there needs to be high table turnover for a restaurant as busy as this so I totally didn't mind when the waiter dropped off our check while we were finishing up. But about 2 minutes later, he came back to check on it despite it being pretty clear we still weren't done and slammed the book cover when he saw I hadn't put my card inside yet.\n\nOVERALL: Honestly, besides the service, it was a really good experience and I'll chalk up the weird service for how busy it was.

Whyyy would anyone want to stand in a 2 hour line in the rain for a bowl of ramen? Could it possibly be worth 2 hours of your life (standing in the cold)? No. \n\nNothing is worth that! Not even the best bowl of ramen in your life. Which, to be honest, this wasn't. I went very simple with my order, since this was my first time here. I got the organic shoyu ramen. It came with kale, duck chashu and pork chashu. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the pork much more than the duck. It was the most tender piece of pork I've ever had in ramen. The noodles were also a stand out for me, since they were thicker than usual. The kale was a nice addition as well.\n\nHowever, I don't think this was the tastiest bowl of ramen I've had. It was clean, simple, and minimal. However, I was really missing the egg! For $14, I've gotten lobster broth, soft shell crab, and quail eggs at Ramen Parlor in San Mateo. I just don't think this $14 bowl of ramen here really compared. \n\nIn addition, the vicinity is tiny, claustrophobic and not that comfortable. I was not a fan of the communal style tables and did not like how close I was to the people next to me. They also don't allow take out--so if you can't finish your ramen there, too bad. There's no way to take it home.\n\nMaybe I would come back here one day, to try some of the more complex menu items. However, if I'm in the mood for ramen, I'll probably go somewhere else. There are plenty of great ramen spots in the bay area where you can skip the line, sit at your own table, and enjoy a variety of delicious menu options for a better price.", "author": "Sara S."}

The place itself is tricky to find because they don't have very many signs or indications that there is an actual restaurant. Like I mentioned previously we waited over an hour and the line was even longer when we left.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9e and I both ordered the tori paitan because we were looking for a more creamier/heavier broth. I added habaneros, chives, chili oil, and garlic flakes. At $2 each addon, my bowl of ramen became pretty pricey. Between the two of us, our total was about $67. Overall, I think the ramen was pretty good. Portion was very generous and I was struggling to finish. They also give a generous amount of noodles which is awesome because a lot of ramen places I've been to short you on the noodles requiring you to order more at an extra charge.\n\nWould We go back?

I mean, if you wait so long, you kind of psych yourself into thinking \"this is gonna be worth it\" but for us, we only waited 22 minutes, it was only worth the wait to experience the hype. \n\nNow for the taste review: the first thing that stood out to me was the fact that the broth wasnt soup. At all. It had the consistency of pasta alfredo so needless to say, it wasn't a ramen you could slurp up. The noodles were of the curly type and compared to all the ramen I've had, it was thicker. The egg was cold when it arrived so if u like cold soft boiled egg (one that the yolk isnt runny but like pudding consistency), then this is for you. It was not for me. I had the shoyu version of it. The broth was very thick (frothy from being whisked before delivered to client), again, reminiscent if eating saucy pasta but the broth taste wasnt bad at all. The umami was there. It wasnt too porky because of the other proteins mixed with it. The chasu was soft (especially the fat) and they give u a big piece along with a slither of duck. Overall, 2/5. \n\nMy husband had the oysters and the lamb. I liked his better. It tasted like something reminiscent of gyro meat.

It's incredibly thick and hearty - not your average tonkotsu. The consistency is like half&half and the flavorful is unbelievable. I got the spicy lamb ramen and it blew my mind!! First of all, lamb in ramen??? Say no more. The lamb came in the form of ground lamb, along with the most tender pork chashu in the world (literally could not pick it up without it falling apart) and two slices of duck meat that I added. The duck meat was so chewy and tender while the lamb added a dimension of aroma and flavor that really changed the entire bowl of ramen. And don't even get me started on the noodles!! Absolutely the thickest, chewiest ramen noodles I have ever tried! These noodles are almost in the realm of udon noodles with how thick they are and I LOVED it. The ramen also came with bean sprouts and mushroom. My only wish is that the ramen could have been a lot more spicier but still, BEST RAMEN I've had. \n\nOur party of three got there about ten minutes before opening and waited about 30 min to be seated, which wasn't too bad.

A big disadvantage that this restaurant is always very packed. Usually, you need to wait in line around 60min. Therefore, I recommend to go there around 5pm or after 10pm on weekdays. Also, rainy day doesn't have many people. My favorite one is chicken paitan!! New matcha paitan is also good!", "author": "Yumiko H."}

Like any other typical ramen place, the place is small = long wait in line. Another attribution is how people tend to come in groups, which slows down the line because they tend to chit chat than enjoy their meal. I've seen many people in groups who haven't ate a bite in 10 minutes because they were busy talking.. made me pretty hangry in line. \n\nI really wanted to like this place for their proclaimed authenticity but would it cost that much in Japan too? Maybe half their price. I had the creamy ramen broth and it was way too creamy/rich for me. It kind of had a grainy consistency of those small bits you find in chicken/pork bones. Like when you bite into a bone, it kind of has a grainy texture. The duck slices were great but I would prefer the standard chashu pork. Overall, my tastebuds didn't sit well with me here so I don't think I would come back unless my friends drag me here.", "author": "Sarah F."}

My friend and I came in around 7 on a Tuesday night, and got in approximately an hour later. We luckily managed to snag two spots at the bar, which was more personable than the other tables, and the place was small. Also asked the waitress if there was a time limit we could dine in and she said no. \n\nI ordered the Tori Paitan ramen. Now I've never, ever been too picky with my ramen. I would be perfectly content with instant noodles,  obviously preferring dine in when occasions rose for it. But I think this spot definitely changed my idea of what GREAT ramen is. The broth was thick, creamy, and rich. And all the elements combined made for an enriching experience, from the soft, chewy noodles to the tender chashu pork, to the burdock root which added a very nice texture. \n\nMy friend had ordered the organic shoyu ramen,  which tasted a lot lighter. Probably the healthier alternative, if you're looking for one. Although we agreed all the elements of it didn't match as well as the Tori Paitan.\n\nI was also very impressed by our appetizer, oysters in shoyu dare oil. The plate was small with only a few pieces. However, from the very first bite, your taste buds just get sent through the roof.

The broth is very thick and flavorful, with the chashu complimenting the broth. The one thing that I thought would take it over the top would be an egg. Sadly, I did not see that add-on option on the menu.\n\nThe service is pretty fast once you get seated. The people working here are kind and respectful.

Tall tables with high stools, with almost no arm space between me and the person next door. Their most popular ramen is the tori paitan ramen so I got that with the enoki mushroom chips as appetizer. Food came out quickly despite the amount of people. The mushroom chips were interesting, different than what most places have to offer, but it did taste somewhat similar to calamari. On to the ramen, it was beautiful when I received it. The noodles were thick and curly, yet bouncy noodles(that's the ramen check). The meat was so tender, yet flavorful with each bite. The broth is also different compared to other places, super rich and thick. I  did end up not really liking the broth towards the end because of how creamy and oily it was.

We all enjoyed what we ordered (two of us got the spicy tori paitain and the other got the lamb) and agreed it was a unique bowl of ramen. We also got the oysters in dare oil, which to me, tasted like canned oysters (wouldn't recommend - both for taste and texture). Overall, not the best ramen I've ever had, but still delicious.\n\nSeating is communal-style and they only have four tables.

So when we saw that they have our favs (mine, shio; his shoyu), we had to come and try. \n\nWe got in line on Saturday at 4:20 for the 5:00 open time. Already, there were 5 groups ahead of us (maybe 12-14 people total?). By 4:45, there were already more than enough people for the first seating. So protip: come here before 4:30 if you want to be part of the group that gets seated in the first round. \n\nWe shared the fried enoki mushroom appetizer (it was ok). I got the shio with the duck chashu add on, and J got the shoyu (which includes the duck chashu). The broth was just the way we like it, light but packed with umami (J finished his entire bowl of broth, which has only happened two other times at the Eat Feastly Noodle In A Haystack ramen popup and at an award-winning ramen shop in Tokyo). Duck chashu was tender and flavorful. Also loved the kale in there, adds a very Californian touch. The only thing that would've made us even more happy was if the noodles were thicker and chewier. \n\nThe paitan and butter clam options that our neighbors ordered looked interesting, but too heavy for my taste. \n\nOverall, we thought it was worth the wait, and we would come back to get our ramen fix when we can't afford the pricier Eat Feastly events. Also, if you think miso, tonkatsu or paitan broths are too heavy, try this place's lighter shio or shoyu broths! It might change what you think about ramen. :)\n\nLast thing, be prepared to get comfortable sitting and slurping up noodles next to strangers (J mentioned feeling a little anxious when we got our ramen first and our neighbors were looking at our food and foodgasm faces, lol).

My sister's boyfriend really wanted ramen so my friend looked up a place and Mensho came up. We came around 7:20pm and waited in line until about 8:20pm (so 1 hour wait). Would I say the line is worth it? Yes and no. \n\nLet me tell you why: Yes because we ordered something really unique--I think it's called the white butter clam ramen ($20)? Or something along the lines of that. My sister ate the clam and she said it was the freshest clam she has ever. I say this dish was unique because they literally have a big white scoop of butter. This added a whole new flavor that I've never tasted before and I wish I was hungry enough to actually enjoy it. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DISH. \n\nWe also ordered the basic Tori Paitan double chashu ramen ($18). I was not a big fan of this one because of how rich, thick, and creamy the broth was. But then again, I imagine this place is pretty popular because of their broth. The only thing I really like about this bowl of ramen was the fact that their bowls came out super hot. \n\nI was sitting at the bar right in front of their kitchen and I saw how they made a real effort to heat up the bowls by dipping it in boiling water.

I understand that it's a european style seating where everyone just sit together at one long table but it's just wayyyyyyy tooo crowded! OMG. I couldn't even have a conversation with the person sitting across from me because I kept getting distracted by all the conversations next to me. There are no privacy here at all.

Let me paint you the picture of my experience. \n\nWe got there early on Saturday night, right before they opened. We were about the 4th to be seated. I saw the line build up, the hostess surveyed the line asking how many were in each party. I observed the pre-opening ritual the staff partook in. The excitement was on the tip of my tongue. \n\nWe were seated with Japanese efficiency, they packed us like tuna at the Tokyo fish market. We were cramped, it was a cozy however because it was a cold, damp rainy November evening. It was so cozy and upclose an personal that I got a very thick wiff of my neighboring patron's BO. I wish they would space us out a bit more. I would have appreciated not having his odor in my upper respiratory system throughout the meal. \n\nI ordered the Tori Paitan with double pork. The Tori Paitan is a rich and creamy chicken based soup with pork and duck and kale. I did not add anything to it. Others around ordered lamb and vegan based soups. The orders came out with surgical efficiency. \n\nWe eat with our eyes and my food was not appetizing when it came. It was grey, dull, without bright colors. The bowl was not large, it was not warm. It was very unappealing. \n\nI dug in, a bit apprehensive but still eager. My first impressions was like I was eating cardboard drenched in fat. It was rich, it was heavy. But it had no flavor. It was more texture than substance.  The noodles were about the only thing they did well. The noodles were cooked perfectly al dente, thick, wavy and filling. I just wish the broth had a but more flavor. I added pepper, without avail. It just couldn't be recovered. I left disappointed with a unsatisfied tongue and empty stomach and an even emptier pocket. \n\nBottom line is the place is cramped, very intimate you barely have any room, the service is surgical and efficient.

It's rich in flavor and I've never tried anything like it before. After some shopping at Westfield mall, I was craving some ramen and happen to stumble across this place on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. The ramen did not disappoint but the wait was pretty bad. We waited for over an hour before we got seated.\n\nEnvironment: 5/5 I really like clean and simple decor. Although there wasn't a lot of decoration, I've noticed some coffee brewers along the glass that allows you to see the kitchen. The first thing I noticed when I walked in were coat hangers but no one seems to be using them. The restaurant is very small with bar top tables and not much space to put your belongings (carry shopping bags was a bad idea). There isn't a lot of room for seating, everyone seems to be squished. I was glad that I got seated in one of the regular chairs and I got the view the kitchen.\n\nFood: 4.5/5 DELICIOUS! Like many people probably said already, the broth here is super rich and creamy. I ordered the Spicy Tori Paitan with an order of egg while my bf got the spicy lamb ramen. First off before I go rambling about my ramen, the spicy lamb broth was a little salty for me. Okay, so the first sip of soup I took was life changing. The broths was perfectly delicious and the both of us would have to agree. This place is prefect for those whole appreciates a thick broth. After few bites in, the broth got too overwhelming for me and I realized that I did not enjoy it as much as my first bite (which is worth every penny). I would say that the noodle grabs onto the soup really well and the soft boiled egg was prefect with the runny yolk. The chashu had the perfect meat to fat ratio; the piece of meat literally melted in my mouth. No chewing was needed! The overall texture of the ramen was great because of the complexity of the toppings that accompanies the noodle.  \n\nPrice: 4/5 It is quite pricey for a bowl of ramen here. The Spicy Tori Paitan ramen that I got was $17 and the spicy lamb was $16. The portion size was like any other ramen shop but it is super filling because of the broth. I would say that it is worth every penny of your money because the ramen is just that good. \n\nCustomer Service: 2.5/5 I feel like I didn't really receive much customer service while I was her. The waitresses all seem super busy to even notice us. Our server just brought over some water, took our order, and brought out the ramen. I don't like how there is an 18% automatic charge for service fee when I feel like the service wasn't that great. \n\nOverall, you must come and try at least once. It will be life changing, I promise! Although the price is a little high for ramen and the wait is terrible, I think it's worth a try. I probably won't be coming here again unless it's for a special occasion or something. The wait time is just too long for me. They didn't really have chairs for people to rest on so we literally had to stand outside the store the entire wait time.

I waited an extra 10-15 minutes for my ramen while everyone else at my table got their Tori Paitan a little while after ordering and even had to ask the waitress to check on my food (politely of course). I was incredibly surprised when my ramen came and it was really watery broth~ I should've checked Yelp pictures before ordering because I definitely wanted a creamier thick broth... so let's just say you definitely get what you pay for. I ended up eating 1/4 of my boyfriend's Tori Paitan and mixing it with my garlic ramen (which tasted really good!) I think Mensho should expand and add more garlic into their creamy rich chicken broth - which by the way, is kind of unique because ramen usually has pork broth. One of my friends complained that the broth was too creamy and oily.. but he's going through a health phase. If you want to be that healthy, just stay in and eat food that you cook yourself ;) The ingredients were fresh and delicious but the prices are really unnecessarily steep. Maybe this is just San Francisco and the way it is but after tax/tip you're definitely paying $20+ if you order their staple ramen dish which is a lot more than other places like Ramen Parlor in San Mateo.", "author": "Leslie T."}

The noodle was perfectly al dente.\n\nMatcha Tori Paitan - basically the Classic version plus green tea powder on top.  You get a hint of green tea as a result - not overly so.

So I stumbled upon this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. Just like many others have mentioned, you do want to come at least 30 minutes early before opening. I came here with my mom and we were about the 10th person in line at 4:30pm. About 5 minutes later, the line extended so far!\nI was not aware of how tight and uncomfortable the seating and environment was. The stools felt very unstable and you're pretty much shoulder to shoulder with those next to you. However, I do have to say that the waitresses are very kind and give you tips on how to eat your ramen and what drinks pair well with it. And since you are sitting so close to people, you tend to get comfortable and familiar with them; at least for me it felt like that.\nIn terms of drinks, we had 2 glasses of plum wine and that was probably the only good thing about the meal. On to the food, I ordered the spicy lamb chashu ramen that had duck and lamb, that was in a thick, rich lamb gravy. While my mom ordered the vegan tantanmen (due to the \"great\" reviews about it). My ramen was SUPER rich, almost painfully rich. The broth is like a gravy, that's very deep in flavor; plus the duck and lamb meat adds to the richness. I'm not use to a thick broth, so it was indeed an \"experience\" eating it. You better be starving before you eat this ramen or you won't be able to finish it; or you might, who knows. However, my mom was extremely disappointed with her ramen. She said that the flavor was very bland and had a very odd taste to it. Even though we are not vegans/vegetarians, some of our all time favorite restaurants are vegan. After reading all the hype about this ramen, she wanted to give it a try; let's just say, we will be more skeptical about choosing items from yelp reviews.\nOverall, it was descent at best; honestly I'd rather give this a 2.5 stars out of 5. I will admit that the ramen is indeed unique but nothing amazing; nothing that will ever make me dream about it. I don't think I'll ever come back here, just because the location is far and I'm sure I can find better ramen places. But I suppose if you live in the area, it might be worth to go back from time to time...maybe.", "author": "Audriana S."}

I didn't mind the wait, because the ramen was worth it. The only thing that annoyed me was I asked for a soft boiled egg because the matcha ramen does not come with any. The host comes out of the kitchen after my food has arrived and announced that she was sorry however, there isn't any eggs left and pointed to the person sitting next to me stating that they have received the last egg. The latter part was extremely unnecessary and made both me and the accused egg eater very uncomfortable. Were we suppose to fight to the death for that last soft boiled egg?

I ordered the Spicy Tori double chashu and my group shared the enoki mushroom chips. I am a huge fan of enoki mushrooms in general, so that was my favorite part of the meal. For the price of the bowl of ramen, I would expect more. However, the chashu was perfect and I loved that the ramen noodles weren't too soft nor too hard. Just right. The broth was good! But it was not a broth I could just drink after I finish my noodles. It was a bit too heavy for me. My friends did enjoy their ramen though.

It tasted like they dunk 10 packs of spicy msg ramen packs in the broth. There were bits of ground lamb and bean sprouts mixed in. I felt like the overly saltiness of the broth toke away the enjoyment of the ramen overall. \n\nOthers:\nThey also have small appetizers and other types of ramen including: no broth ramen, shio and shoyu and a vegan ramen! No Tonkatsu (although I think Tori Paitan is closest to it but a bit more heavy). They advertise for Tsukemen (dipping) Ramen on their walls, but don't actually have it on their menu which is a little misleading.

I think the best time to go is right when it opens because you'll be the first wave of people in. Even if you miss the first wave, the second wave will be about 20 minute. The shortest wait I've experienced was about 20 minutes (woo!) and the longest was about an hour and a half. I think everyone dining at Mensho is pretty good with their time but I remember one time when this group of girls was just chatting their lives away for 30 minutes after they finished their ramen. I don't want to sound rude but please do everyone a favor and not talk about your life problems at Mensho.\n\nMy favorite is the Tori Paitan (with extra chasu!) but all of my vegetarian and vegan friends also love the vegan ramen!

First of all, I hate thick broths with a passion, but this was so flavorful and creamy. I don't know if its the Katsuobushi sauce or the Burdock, but this is a stand out ramen and maybe one of the best!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-24", "description": "In Japan, it is polite to slurp your noodles. \n\nSometimes I would walk to my wife's work all the way to Presidio Heights from downtown and take Geary as my main route. One day, I noticed a long line of people waiting outside the Alcazar Theatre and wondered what the hoopla was all about. It suddenly clicked that this was one of the most anticipated opening of a Ramen shop straight from Japan. \n\nChef and owner Tomoharu Shono's Mensho Tokyo is one of many restaurants he owns in Japan, and this is the first restaurant opened outside of Japan. I think it's fitting he chose San Francisco as we have been starved of good, authentic Ramen for so long. Most of my \"best Ramen experience\" so far have been in L.A., Vegas and the Peninsula. \n\nDuring the next couple months while walking pass this place, I would often gauge at the line and figured it would eventually die down but that never happened. So this past Sunday, I tried to convince the Wifey to get here early prior to their opening time, but she didn't want to \"waste\" time waiting in line and instead we got here around 7PM. You gotta have patience and brave the crackheads and crazies if you want some good Ramen and it better be worth it....and it was. \n\nAfter about an hour, we finally got seated and we both had the Tori Paitan Ramen (Double Chasu) and Oysters in Dare Oil, the only appetizer they served. The oysters had a subtle smoky and soy sauce flavor that was quite delightful, but may be an acquired taste for some. The Ramen is a creamy mixture of chicken soup with two slices of pork belly, two slices of duck breast, menma (bamboo shoots), burdock, kale and Katsuobushi sauce. \n\nThe broth of the Ramen was thick, rich, creamy that was not too overpowering and it was quite an exquisite flavor bursting of umami. The noodles were thicker and cooked al dente to which I thoroughly enjoyed as it had a good snap to it. Now, had this been in Japan, I would have been slurping the noodles as the technique aerates the noodles and the broth, allowing the flavors to mellow out and fully develop before you chew and swallow. It also cools off your mouthful of noodles just enough to let you enjoy them while the rest of the bowl stays piping hot.\n\nHowever....I couldn't get myself to do it since we are in a communal table. I was tempted to, but this ain't Japan and I wanted to eat \"politely\" to the rest of the patrons eating beside me. Regardless, we were enjoying our bowls of Ramen as these were right up there with some of the best we've had so far. \n\nSide note: I did some researching on the Chef and I am excited to see what bold new flavors he can come up with next. There's a particular lamb-based broth he made in Japan and wonder if he can recreate that here. He also can't make the same exact broths as he would like here due to health codes and regulations. I just hope he finds a way and I will slurp my way back here if he does.", "author": "John G."}

Seats are tight because it's basically family style on the four long tables inside.

The food came out fast and this is where the disappointment sets in. We got the ume shio chasu and double chasu and boy, was it salty. I liked the texture of the noodles but just couldn't get past how salty the broth was. When I got to the bottom of the bowl, it got even saltier and was so relieved I was done with it. My friend said he liked the pork but I didn't have any comment on that. \n\nThis was such a letdown. I guess my expectations were too high having had ramen in Japan and orenchi in Santa Clara.

The noodles were the right consistency and the broth was rich and flavorful. I wasn't the one who ended up with this bowl, but I was wishing I had ordered it. My Shio ramen was okay.

As I studied the restaurant through their window, I realized they only had 3 large tables that seated roughly 6-10 people and a counter in the back facing the kitchen, which seated around 4. The walls had descriptions of the growing popularity of the cuisine and its origin. There were TV screens displaying clips of ramen chefs, ramen eaters and soft music playing in the background. The lamps that hung down from the ceiling was also interesting as the brightness changed throughout the night. \n\nMy friend and I both got the tori paitan and shared the enoki chips. The tori paitan was on top of the menu and a great selection for first timers. With the tori paitan, you can really taste the essence and quality of their signature features. The tori paitan consisted of a rich, creamy and smooth chicken flavored broth with duck cha siu, pork cha siu, kale, menma (bamboo shoots), burdock (herb) and katsuobushi sauce. The combination was super satisfying. The noodles resembled the shape of Maruchan ramen, but the noodles are way better in quality, thickness and consistency. \n\nThe enoki chips were one of a kind because I have never seen it on any other menu in San Francisco. Comes with a side of chili powder and black sesame seeds. The taste reminded me of crispy hash browns. I definitely enjoyed the odd associations that came with ordering the enoki chips, because it also reminded me eating enoki mushrooms during hot pot too. xD\n\nI think Mensho Tokyo absolutely deserves 4-5 stars, but there is always room for improvement. The slight anticipation you get from the wait is always something you can complain about. :P", "author": "Jennifer Z."}

But it's good. \n\nI came on a weekday at 6 pm, waited for about 70 minutes lining up outside of the restaurants. Good thing it wasn't too cold, or else I would have left. \n\nAfter looking through the photos on Yelp and the whole menu, I ordered Paitan with chili oil on the side. And also the fried enoki chips as appetizer. The broth was thick and flavored. The noodle was thick and el dente. Overall, it was a good bowl of ramen if you like thick broth. However, I would like to note they did not add a lot of side flavors to their broth (Which could be a good thing for some). To me, it was lacking a kick in ramen. Also notice that I had to ask for chili oil on the side as the paitan did not have a spicy option. It was a subtle broth, but its rich enough to hold the ramen. \n\nI'm not too impressed given the long wait and the hype of this place. However, It's good and I'm willing to come back and try other ramen. As for the wait, it's San Francisco, so I'll suck it. But keeping fans wait outside under a cold weather would be very cruel!

No reservations may be made.  This was of the norm.  Had to wait a good 45 minutes even prior before it opened.  There were people in the agonizing line already and the turnover for a tiny place, isn't appealing either. \n\nCommunal seating on high chairs.  Definitely different from what I'm use to on seatings at ramen shops.  There were a few side seatings, but very limited.  I would opt for that and not be open for side conversation if topics are required to be discussed more in depth in between 2 people.  It's a hassle to bring a party of 6!  A group of 4 would be nice on the communal table.  You can't be choosy, unless you want to wait even longer.  I felt packed like sardines and quite claustrophobic.\n\nIt was an uncomfortable dining experience.\n\nThe snowflake sake was much needed after the wait and as a way to relieve the weekday workflow on a Friday!  When we asked which sake to order, the waitress recommended an unexpected different one that I have not tried before in sake.  It was like a creamy, smooth yogurt mixed in drink with a sake shot. It was wonderful.\n\nOrdered up the organic ramen with chashu. It was the homely broth, stringy noodles, spot on chashu with flavor and right tenderness, and a surprisingly big metal spoon.  Nothing to me, was spazzing or to rave over about.  They give you a tiny scooping spoon for the hot sauce.  I mind as well pour the entire hot sauce container into my bowl or use the huge metal spoon for that hot sauce!  I was thinking about it and how to proceed at that time.  I love hot sauce with my ramen, but I didn't need to flame the fire in me on a Friday.  Cooling it with that snowflake sake was rather nice. \n\nAye okay ramen bowl, but not worth the wait and my needed space to whine down and simply enjoy good company without worrying to be gestured out with the bill and seeing through the transparent window of that endless line.  \n\nIt's one of those days where you just don't want to deal with it, but your dining partner set up that time and place to do so.  In my case, I guess I dealt with it and not wanting to be that flaker. \n\nSo, if you're a foodie and love ramen testing, this would be a perfect spot to try out.  However, you deal with the wait, tightly squeezed ambiance and given limited time to dine.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-11-28", "description": "For all the hype that is Mensho, it just doesn't hit the mark.  \n\nI ordered their signature Tori paitan ramen with extra chashu, which is a chicken white broth ramen.  It came their fresh ramen noodles, 2 pieces of pork (which were quite thin), topped with some veggies, bonito flakes. Overall, i just found it quite lacking.\n\nThe three criteria which I usually judge quality ramen are:\n\n1. Noodles - cooked with a bit of bite to it, similar to al dente\n2. The broth - flavorful and compliments the noodles and toppings\n3. The soft boil egg - a staple to most ramen, and shows how well the place cooks their food.\n\nNow, to put these criteria to the test.\n\n1. Mensho have some great ramen noodles. It was perfectly cooked and quite delicious 5/5.\n2. The tori paitan broth was quite unfamiliar to me. Maybe it is just wasn't my style, because a chicken broth tends to be a lighter base compared to the typical tonkatsu broth you find elsewhere.  But the \"light\" broth with the heaviness of the creamy base just seemed to be unbalanced and just not as appealing to the palate. This is just my opinion, but seeing as how this is their most popular dish, they must be appealing to others  2/5\n3. Soft boil egg.... There was none.  This is the first popular ramen place I have been to which did not serve an egg with their ramen.  This baffled me. Maybe their are trying to appeal to the \"vegan\" sensibility which makes no sense since ramen usually has an animal based broth.  0/5\n\nFor a $18 dollar bowl of ramen ( it was $2 extra for a thin slice of pork), it did not meet my expectation.  The broth was dull and unbalanced, the toppings lacking, and even the noodles couldn't save the dish.  It is quite a shame. Maybe this place is more of a hype since the long lines and small location make it seem like an amazing ramen parlor.\n\nThe long lines and mediocre broth just push this place to the wayside, but I guess if you are willing to wait for average food, and have the money to spend, try it out.", "author": "Jacky C."}

Had to wait in line for 20 minutes, but I heard from locals the wait can get up to 2 hours ... ouch. That being said, once I was seated, I ordered my ramen. In regards to offerings available here, this joint serves up different broths with modified tiers in each section along with appetizers, sake, and alcohol. As for how I found the ramen, it was quite good. The broth was more creamy than I imagined, but not so much to be overpowering. The egg was runny and warm, which is just the way I like it, and the noodles were perfect consistency - not too soft that it fell apart before you ate it but also not too chewy either. The chili pepper powder was a nice addition & the fixings only served to make this bowl a delight to eat. Now, would I say it lives up to the hype? ... Maybe. Reason why I say that is that there are plenty of comparable ramen places around this area that you can go to that don't require a 2-hr wait during peak hours.

The chairs can get a bit uncomfortable but i mean it's a ramen spot, you're not going to be there for that long so... SUCK IT UP!!!  \n\nWhen people used to tell me \"oh their noodles are extra good bc it's handmade noodles\", I would just smile but think to myself like \"YOU CAN'T TELL IF IT'S HANDMADE NOODLES OR NOT!!!\"  Well, I thought that until I had Mensho.  The noodles are nice & thick but very soft AND chewy.  You can tell tell they're handmade noodles!!!  The texture is great but I think the best thing about these noddles is the fact that the broth flavor sticks to the noodles very well, making your bite that much more flavorful.  Most ramen places I go to, I'm that guy eating the noddles with chopsticks AND spoon like I'm eating a bowl of pho, trying to eat the noodles while enjoying the flavor of the broth.  Well, you don't need to do that here.  The broth flavor sticks very well to the nice thick noodles so you can enjoy your bowl how you're supposed to.\n\nWhat's also amazing about this place is that the broth is not overly salty like other places where you have to drink a gallon of water to keep yourself hydrated from all that salt.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is about the broth but it's very flavorful without being overly salty.\n\nI'm not going to act like this is my regular ramen place I've been eating at for the past 5 years but I highly recommend the Tori Paitan which comes with pork & duck meat!  I am not a big fan of duck meat but TRUST ME!!!  You have to try it!  The lamb ramen was really good also.  Again, I'm not a big fan of lamb but you really have to try it!!!  Shoyu chasu ramen is probably the best I've had in its category.  \n\nPLEASE NOTE:  15% gratuity is already added to your tab.

Over it.\n\nThere must be something buried deep in our Americanized taste buds that confuses \"tasty\" with \"an abundance of sodium\".

I got to Mensho 30 minutes before their opening and there was already a line outside. So if you come...come early!! \nI came alone so I got to sit at the bar and I could watch the ramen chefs at their work. The place itself it pretty aesthetically pleasing, but it's also super cramped. Four people is honestly the max. The bigger tables are all connected, so you're also essentially going to be sitting with strangers. \nAs for the ramen, I was slightly disappointed. I went with the Tori Patan ramen instead of the matcha. Matcha in ramen sounds so strange, but I think I'd come back to try the matcha. \nFor $16, I got to have pretty good ramen noodles. The noodles weren't hard or soft, for lack of a better word..they were bouncy. But the soup killed my vibe. Perhaps I'm just not used to thick ramen soup, but it was strange. First sip, I thought I was drinking a fatty cream. The chashu did not melt. I had to chew a bit. I did prefer the duck chashu over the pork, just because it was more bite-sized and with chashu that doesn't melt in your mouth..easier to chew. The dried burdock root was super tasty though.  I couldn't get enough of it. I had to add an egg because ramen isn't ramen without an egg. The egg was delicious except it was a bit over done. But I'm not complaining because making a perfect ramen egg is extremely difficult. \nSo, for a spontaneous trip to SF I got to eat $22 ramen. It is overpriced, but if you consider SF rent, I'll take it. I would come again just to try the matcha ramen, but this is not going to be on my ramen must have list.

I mean the complexity of flavors you are getting from any great ramen broth takes time and love...hours of it. Trust me.. I've seen documentaries on it??..pause. hahahah \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af . Well, try to pay some damn respect to the art! An hour wait for amazing ramen such as mensho is a small price to pay so get to scrolling through your social media feeds or better yet talk to others who are waiting alongside you. You guys are all in line for some the same bowl of ramen so you must share interests. Sheesh. \n\nTori Paitan Double Chashu...must get, would order again and again. The broth was nothing short of excellent. It was unlike any ramen broth I've ever had considering I've never had chicken based broth. Real thick in consistency but it clinged onto each and every bite of noodles as I almost slurped my face off.  The noodles had the perfect balance of resilience to it. Not too chewy, not too soft. Absorbant enough to pick up the broth's flavor. I loved that. The egg though...I was not expecting it to be flavored. I believe we got the soy sauce flavored egg which was something new and different to me. Don't get me started with the combination of pork&duck chashu. I've never had duck in my ramen but now I can't imagine my bowls of ramen without it. First world problems smh. The enoki mushroom chips were also a great idea... so light and crisp. I ended up using these mushroom chips as a garnish to my ramen. Next level... \n\nNo complaints about their quick and great service. Gratuity is automatically applied to the your bill though. I wish the shop was larger but I wouldn't complain if my shop had a line out the door on a daily basis. The decor and ambiance is a nice touch.

Line was not too long and table for two was seated in 45 minutes (it was 10:00 pm on Friday at the time though). This place is also very tiny, so not such a good place to dine at if you're with a party larger than 4 folks.\n\nMy bud and I were feeling adventurous so we went ahead and ordered the Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil and I think our experience would have been better off if we didn't order it (personal preference of ours, it might be amazing to someone else). \n\nJapanese IPA and Sake made for an awesome double-fist combo as we downed the oysters.\n\nI tried their Tori Paitan Ramen with double ChaShu - after my first bite, I knew I was in for something special for the entire meal.

Was not impressed with the options for the sides. They did not have corn!! So used to eating my ramen with corn..and no chili flakes either!

The broth is wonderfully flavorful and creamy, and the noodles are the perfect texture and chewiness. It's like they took all my disappointments with other ramen bowls, fixed them, and added their own special mix. It's absolutely fantastic!\n\nAt first glance, it's one of the more pricey bowls of ramen that I've had and I had my doubts about eating there or ordering the Tori Paitan.

Prior to trying Mensho, Ippudo Ramen in NY was my favorite ramen spot ever. Unfortunately Mensho has stolen Ippudo's spotlight and is seriously the best ramen that I've ever had.\n\nHad an impromptu day with some friends in the city and kinda winged it as to where to get food. My friend was browsing through Yelp for awhile and he picked very wisely. He asked if we were down for some ramen and off we went. Luckily when we got there, the line was starting to form so it wasn't too bad. We got in line while my friend tried to find parking. We waited in line for about 1.5 hour which honestly isn't that bad since Mensho is pretty small inside. So keep in mind it's not friendly for groups. As the line started to move once their doors opened and people were filling up the tables, my friends and I were so close to getting in and we were close to making the cut.\n\nWhile anxiously waiting we browsed through their menu and as people were leaving, we asked what they got which made the decision process a lot easier. Finally we got seated by this counter seating which was fine. We got to see the chefs in action and it was interesting to see the process of it all. I had ordered the Clam Butter Chashu Ramen since I've never seen anywhere serve clams with ramen. My friends got the Tori Paitan Ramen with Duck Chashu and the Spicy Lamb Chashu Ramen. We ordered the Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil, which was really yummy. There was enough pieces for the 3 of us to try and to hold off our appetite as we patiently waited for our ramen.\n\nOnce our ramen had arrived, we tried each other's broths. The ones that my friends ordered had a creamy broth and it was so savory and delicious. My broth was lighter but still delicious. At first when I tried the broth for my ramen, it had a strong seafood taste but after mixing that whipped butter and all the other ingredients in my bowl together, there was a huge shift in the taste of my broth. It was much more flavorful and that strong seafood taste was masked...probably by the butter but I'm not complaining. The noodles in my ramen were a bit different from my friends but they were so fresh and tasty. So delicious!\n\nThe service was alright. Had to flag down a server a few times to get more water. They were busy and it was packed so I understand. The decor was very simple and minimal.\n\nWhen my friend had told me it was Michelin star rated I wasn't sure how I felt but after trying the food, it definitely proved me wrong. The quality of the ingredients was amazing. As mentioned earlier, it's one of the best ramen that I've ever had. I was craving for more the next day because it was so good. We had met some tourists in line and they told us it was their second time going during their trip in SF. That speaks volume.\n\nHighly suggest trying this place and try to come as early as possible to wait in line. There was already a line at 4PM and they don't open until 5PM.

You can either wait in line later, or you can wait in line before it opens. We chose the latter. We got there at 430pm, expecting to wait 30 minutes for the 5pm opening. Luckily, there was only 1 person ahead of us. Was able to walk down the street grab a cup of coffee from Starbucks and return without any problems.\n\nCome 5 pm, window shades open. Pristine, small, clean dining room with the kitchen in the back. You could just anticipate a good ramen experience. Appeared it was well-staffed. Unfortunately, no one opened the door, as everyone just peered through the window, watching the staff working on the computer system.... Wait 5 minutes, nothing. Wait 10 minutes, nothing. Wait 30 minutes, finally, the head hostess comes out.\n\n\"Sorry, but our system is not accepting credit card. We can only accept cash. Please go to an ATM.\" Are you kidding me? I think cash-only establishments are OK, and I have no problem with this. But really? It took you 30 minutes to let us know this? Of course, all of us in line have been waiting and waiting, so we all make a dash to the nearest ATM. I think it makes more sense to let us know at the very beginning there was issues, so while we inevitably wait more in line, we can go get some cash......... amiright?\n\nFurther insult to injury. we didn't get seated for another 15 minutes... So really, 45 minutes after \"opening.\" It doesn't make common sense.\n\nAnyway, had the Tori Paitan ramen and the Vegan Tantanmen.\n-Tori Paitan: Deep chicken broth flavor. Very creamy and filling. I think I heard it described as a chicken soup for rich people. I may be able to buy into this description. For our patience in line, we got an extra chashu (which is not the best anyway). Noodles were very enjoyable, al dente, and on point. However, the broth just didn't do it for me.\n-Vegan tantanmen: Surprisingly, I will have to rate this above the tori paitan. The flavor is fuller and more complex. It has almost a nutty quality to it, so if you don't like nuts, would not suggest this one. But it was always very creamy and filly of a broth. Noodles the same. \n\nUnfortunately, given the late start and unreasonable wait without explanation (and even with an explanation, still does not explain make us wait beyond the opening time), I have to rate an overall 2 stars.

Your snack options are the fried enoki mushrooms and oyster appetizer. But you come here to be taught how ramen can be transcendental and get an experience closer to what you might have in Japan.\n\nThe tori paitan broth is unlike any I have had. Thick and rich, but not chunky. Full of umami. In fact, the tori paitan is the best chicken based broth you can find in San Francisco. Toppings were extremely complementing and portioned perfectly. The chasu is especially notable. Have not had better chasu at any ramen house. Noodles were thicker, bouncy, chewy, and oozing with flavor from the broth. The balance between the ramen noodles and broth was absolutely perfect such that the broth clung to the noodles to give your every bite flavor. \n\nIf you would like a lighter meal, try the shoyu broth. This is my usual go to :) The noodles a little flatter and the broth is absolutely rich, but not heavy at all. My other favorite is the arubasoba -- a soupless ramen made with a soyu, garlic, and pork base. \n\nBetween eating ramen in Tokyo and here, Mensho is the only spot that satisfies.", "author": "Kathy Z."}

I had never had duck in my ramen before, but it was so tender and juicy and a great addition.\n- handmade noodles. They had that inconsistent size and shape characteristic of a handmade noodle and they weren't chewy and harder like the premade or packaged ramen at some other spots. \n\nCONS:\n- the broth! This might be an unpopular opinion, but it was just too damn rich and creamy, almost as if they had poured cups and cups of cream and milk. I definitely wasn't able to consume much of the broth after getting through the ramen and for hours after my meal, I felt like I was going to be sick. If (IF!) I were to come back again (maybe when it's raining and there's no ridiculous line), I'd try the Shoyu broth instead. \n- so there's kale in your ramen...but no option to add an egg?

We decided to be smart people and arrived here right when the restaurant opened. Boy, were we late. We waited an additional 2 hours in line after arriving at the restaurant right when it opened. The restaurant itself is fairly small and only had room for seating for a small amount of people. Majority of the people at the restaurant ended up sharing with another party when they sat down.

Just remember to pick them up when u leave.\n\nBeen meaning to try this place since my friends said it was so good.   The menu is very limited, only one appetizer offered, oysters for $5, which had a oily smoky taste.  We also had the Tori Paitan, which was really thick and creamy, garnished with thin slices of duck, chasrsiu, burdock and kale. For extra charsiu, there was an extra $2 charge. \n\nWould come back to try other items on the menu.  We sat on the counter facing the kitchen, so it was entertaining watching our order being made and served to us.

This is definitely up there in the top 5 ramens that I've had. \n\nThis place is tiny, so brace yourself for a wait. I came at 7:30 pm on a Friday evening with just one other person, and waited about 30-45 min. I probably wouldn't wait more than an hour for the ramen. It's good, but there are other things to eat that are good that don't warrant just standing in line outside in the Tenderloin. Because the place is tiny and communal seating, don't come with more than one other person. Maybe a max of 4 people.\n\nThere are 3 different types of broth you can order but I got the Tori Paitan which is a rich, creamy chicken broth. I haven't really seen this kind of broth in other places, but it's so delicious and indulgent. It's definitely not healthy, and I don't want to see what this broth looks like when it is cold and starts to solidify. The chashu was tender and almost fell apart, and the other toppings were delicious. The noodles were al dente and just perfect. It was really filling - I don't think I could have done extra noodles or extra chashu.\n\nWe also shared enoki chips which were deep fried enoki with a slightly spiced batter. They were definitely unique and delicious and would recommend this. The serving size was pretty decent on this.\n\nI can't wait to come back here again - everything was delicious and I felt like I could have been transported to Japan. If you like a good bowl of ramen and have the patience to wait 30 min - 1 hour, go here.  The service, ambiance and food were all on pointe.

The hype, the line, the expensive menu - worth it.\n\nCame here a little after 5 on a Sunday, the line was already down the street but my bf and I hopped in and anxiously awaited.  SF people are all about their lines, brunch, pastries, dinners, coffee, the Mensho Tokyo line just never seemed to move. We made the most of it by chatting with near by starving foodies about the absurdity of the long line all wondering if this place would live up to the hype. Thankfully, with a party of 2 we were able to skip some larger parties in line and got seats right at the bar looking into the kitchen. \n\nThe restaurant is small but simple and clean.  Service was quick, we were immediately greeted by a waitress and placed the order right away.  One great thing about this place is the menu is so simple and straight forward,  no need to take time and decide what to get, only one appetizer and a few noodle options. I choose the Vegan Tantanman. \n\nMy food came out way before my boyfriends dish so he did have to sit and salivate for a while watching me enjoy my big noodle bowl of goodness before he was able to dive in.  The flavor of the broth was incredible, rich in flavor a bit spicy, perfectly salty.  Typically with vegan/vegetarian noodle dishes the broth is lacking in flavor, but this one tasted like it had been simmering for days and I could drink it all day.  The noodles were perfectly al dente, a bit thicker than I am used to but nice for soaking up all the broth. \n\nMy only issue with this spot was the fact that you could not take leftovers home.  I was so full from slurping up these delicious noodles and wanted to enjoy them the next day for lunch but the server told me it was owners policy that food couldn't be taken to go.  I hate to see food go to waste, especially after spending $20 on a bowl of noodles I wanted the chance to split this huge portion up into two meals. Hopefully they will either rethink this or next time we will go and share a dish as we were both left with a lot of food leftover.

As they do in Japan, Mensho will take your order while you are in line, so that your ramen is ready as soon as you get seated. \n\nThe Tori Paitan is the move if you like thicker broth.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-18", "description": "TLDR: Tori Paitan was freaking awesome, spicy lamb is good but very heavy on the spice (gave me major heartburn and I didn't even finish the whole thing, wouldn't order again), enoki chips were too oily and dense (wouldn't order again), wait was 1 h 15 m, glad I waited this first time, not sure it's worth waiting that long for a meal that took less than 30 m to eat and pay other than on occasions where we feel like coming to eat at this specific restaurant. \n\nThe wait: Came on a Saturday night and arrived to line up at 6:40 PM, knowing it would be a loooong wait. Ended up waiting 1 h 15 m, which is both far longer than we ever like to wait on a normal basis but also shorter than we expected for a clear and cold weekend evening. I was, however, already fairly hungry when we got in line, so waiting really kicked my hunger up even further, and I basically inhaled my food when I got in. I would suggest going when you're just getting hungry, or otherwise have a light snack before you head out, because if not, you'll end up scarfing your meal down without taking a moment to enjoy it!\n\nThe food: we ordered the tori paitan with double chashu, spicy lamb, and enoki chips. \n\nThe 'chips' were more like an oily pile of mushrooms, and although interesting in theory, way too oily and heavy - would have loved something a little lighter. The portion size was actually larger than we expected, so we probably could have gone without them knowing we were ordering two bowls of ramen. \n\nThe tori paitan was deeeeelish, albeit heavy, since it's a 'creamy' ramen. The duck chashu was a nice change from the typical ramen we go out for, and the pork was unbelievably tender.\n\nThe spicy lamb was not too spicy in the heat sense, but rather overly spiced for my taste, which detracted significantly from my experience. The spices used were ones I've eaten before with no trouble, but usually far less in amounts, so I ended up with a severely sour stomach. Quality is still there, so my dislike of it is more a matter of preference - and the fact that I apparently have a slightly more sensitive stomach.\n\nOverall, quality and quantity is definitely more than a few notches above other ramen places I've eaten at in SF, and I would recommend going at least once to try it for yourself. Whether or not you end up going back to wait in that line subsequent times is really up to how amazing you think the ramen is.", "author": "Kristen T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-12-30", "description": "Some context, I'm a foodie from LA visiting SF over winter vacation. Mensho Tokyo was one of my top restaurants to check out after reading a yelp review ranking this place over other LA places this particular yelper had tried. I've scoured the LA ramen scene and rank Tsujita Annex above all else, which is the bar to which all other ramens are judged for me.\n\nBroth: To me, broth in ramen is most important followed by the noodles. I ordered the Spicy Tori Paitan and tasted the base soup before mixing in the red peppers and miso that make this the spicy version. The base soup was thick, creamy, and frothy but paradoxically tasted both rich and bland (flavors didn't pop) at same time. Something was missing. After mixing in spices the soup started to taste like Korean doenjang jjigae, which was kinda weird because I've never had doenjang jjigae with noodles.\n\nCompared to Tsujita Annex's broth which I just want to keep drinking against my better judgment (i.e., heart attack), the broth at Mensho lost my interest after a few spoonfuls.\n\nAlso, the thickness of broth made all the other ingredients sink into it, which made my bowl of ramen looked like a primordial soup halfway through.\n\nOverall, although the broth had layers of different flavors, but it didn't grab me. Perhaps I just didn't get the complexity. I had high expectations coming in given all the signage of its unique umami flavor and special nori that they use. IMO, the soup lacked  that \"yummy\" quality that makes my mouth water, which happens when I just think about the broth from Tsujita Annex or other places like Hakata Ikkousha or even the humble Santouka in Mitsuwa food court.\n\nNoodles: Thick, chewy, bouncy, nice texture and cooked a bit al dente. The noodles in themselves were great, and on par with Tsujita Annex.  Broth clung to the noodles well, however because I wasn't that big a fan of the broth, I didn't feel a desire to finish the noodles.\n\nChashu: I ordered single portion and didn't get to try the duck chashu. The pork chashu was mediocre and served thin, lukewarm, and on lean side compared to other places. It was tender but did not melt in my mouth.\n\nExtras: Surprisingly, my favorite part of the bowl was the bamboo shoots. They were flavored very well and had a nice crunch to them.\n\nVenue: Venue is small with about four communal tables and a few seats at bar facing kitchen. I came alone and had fun watching the chefs do their magic.\n\nWait: It is what it is. There wasn't a sign in sheet which required everyone to stay in line. I waited 35 minutes at around 9pm Friday, but if longer, it would be great to have option of putting name down and wander streets a bit to pass time. \n\nService: Given how busy they are, it is understandable that waiting staff are inattentive, but they were also not very cordial. Back in my hometown of Torrance, I'm used to mom and pop japanese places where there is a loud greeting and farewell regardless of how busy the place is. At Mensho, the waitress didn't give any acknowledgement (verbal or nonverbal) after I thanked her for the meal as I walked out. Not a big deal but I left with an unwelcome feeling. Also worth noting is that they included a service charge to bill. Total came out to $22 for one bowl of ramen (ouch). I've had really really good service at other busy SF eateries so my experience here may not just be a stranger effect (\"people are strange when you're a stranger\").\n\nAtmosphere: Decor is a bit generic and did not feel like a Japanese place in a traditional sense. I don't think I heard one word of japanese my entire time there.", "author": "Yong P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-04", "description": "The advance hype on this place was off the charts, and the breathless texting and taxing anticipation from the hipsterati of self-proclaimed ramen connoisseurs has been quite deafening. A two-plus-hour wait for an $18 bowl of ramen sounds like a Louis C.K. joke about San Francisco millennials with no punchline. I got exhausted thinking about the hoops I'd have to jump through to get a taste of the broth here. However, now that at least six weeks have elapsed since the grand opening in February, I had an opening that I couldn't bypass, the Thursday before Good Friday when I got off work early.\n\nEveryone says to be there at 4PM even though they don't open until an hour later, and so I did. If you don't count the screeching homeless woman who kept sauntering by, no one else showed up until around 4:35PM. That's not to say the staff was indifferent to my presence as they thanked me for coming and waiting patiently. Eventually a line did start to form and rather quickly. I got seated at the front counter promptly at 5PM where I had a nice view of the kitchen where activity was bustling behind he coffee beakers with the broth at full boil and the pork and duck chashu being meticulously sliced. I was sitting with a Filipino family who could barely contain their enthusiasm over the forthcoming noodlefest.\n\nI was feeling the same way and knew what to order since I had well over an hour to decide. I started with their one and only appetizer, the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. There were four of them completely shelled and marinated (photo: http://bit.ly/1Vp0sEV). Tasty freshness gone too soon, but the main event was about to occur. It was the $18 Tori Paitan Ramen with Double Pork Chashu, and I had them add an extra couple of Duck Chashu slices for $1.50 extra because why not go to town? The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the chashu was meaty without being overwhelming. Slices of menma, kale and burdock floated on top with a katsuobushi (bonito) sauce spooned on top (photo: http://bit.ly/224L6pv).\n\nHowever, for all the fresh ingredients, it was that rich paitan chicken broth that lingers not only on the palate but in my sense-memory. Just the natural creaminess of it was amazing, and what really makes this bowl of ramen stand out against the others. There are three other ramen bowls on the menu - organic shoyu, shio, and vegan tantanmen, as well as a selection of mazesoba bowls. I was timid and just had a $4.75 bottle of Sapporo Premium to wash it all down (photo: http://bit.ly/1RTN9dq), but they have pricier Japanese artisan beers which they strongly recommended to me for the next time. And there will be a next time even as I saw the line go down the block as I departed.\n\nFOOD - 5 stars...best paitan ramen broth ever, period\nAMBIANCE - 4.5 stars...clean, white and you only wish it was triple the size to make the line move faster\nSERVICE - 5 stars...lovely people work here\nTOTAL - 5 stars...not just for self-proclaimed ramen connoisseurs...be patient or come near closing", "author": "Ed U."}

First, as someone who generally does not like getting too close to strangers, I thought the close seating arrangement was tolerable. Since the wait is so long, the literature on the walls was enough to educate/entertain me, and the specialty of their kombu broth does seem authentic after tasting it. However, I think this particular broth needed time getting adjusted with because it was much earthier than what I've had at typical American ramen places. I would even suggest nixing the bamboo shoots because for the first half of my meal, I could not taste anything but that strong pickly bamboo taste which took away from the broth flavor. The egg was seasoned to the T--rich, pungent, and oversalted even. I had to be careful eating that egg. Overall, not worth the wait or the price tag for me as someone who has affordable ramen options back home, and not unique enough for me to come back.", "author": "Hong L."}

We didn't get a starter but I got the Tori Paitan (single not double) cause I didn't want to pay that much for ramen, but it was amazing!  So much flavor and the duck and pork were so tender and just melted in my mouth.  The broth was filled with all this flavoring and was a bit thick but I slurrrrped it all down.  I could've drank the whole broth but decided against that lol.  This is a must get, definitely, for real for real.  Get this one!\n\nMy bf got the clear soup, Shoya ramen, and tbh I didn't like it.

It's super thick, almost gravy like, yet still remains pretty light. I haven't had anything like it before. You can tell the broths quality with it's texture and deep flavor, definitely been cooking for HOURS.Add in some super tender chashu (both pork AND duck), menma, springy and squiggly noodles, kale, and some katsuoboshi (bonito shavings) and you got yourself their TP ramen. Hella flavor! \n\nNormally, it's $16 for a bowl but you only get one piece of meat so I'd recommend getting a double chashu for $18. Personally, I got the double and got an extra piece of chashu (since that's how I roll) and boom, baller bowl of ramen for $20. \n\nPerfect comfort food for those cold SF summer nights. I ain't spending hours making a ramen broth so it wasn't bad waiting an hour in line (Arrived on a Thursday @8:30pm, seated at 9:30pm). My tip - It's better to go later, wait times are shorter. \n\nOther bites. \n*SHIO RAMEN $11 - very clean, deep, clear. The noodles were fettucine like.\n*OYSTERS IN SHOYU DARE OIL - 4 for $5.

That's impossible right? Well, I'm not easy to please in terms of ramen, but the fact that I actually drank the entire chicken broth is saying something! The restaurant opens at 5pm, but a huge line already started forming before it even opened. My friends got a spot in line at about 4:45pm, and I met up with them 30 minutes later. Total wait for us was about 1.5 hours, but I heard people have waited at least 2 hours for this. There is no sign up sheet for waiting, just an old fashioned wait your turn in line kinda deal. There's also not a lot of seating inside, so the wait makes more sense. Once you're inside, you still have to wait about 30 minutes from being seated to having your ramen come out.\n\nTIP: If you're comfortable and brave enough to eat alone, single seats are most likely available for you to skip the line if there are groups with odd numbers.\n\nParking in this area is kind of difficult, especially with all the one way streets and meter parking. If you wait till about 5:45pm on weekdays, rush over to take the parking right across the street. Parking is free and allowed at 6pm along this part of Geary. \n\nThe menu is pretty simple too, with your choice of Ramen, Tsukemen, and Mazesoba. The most popular one is the Tori Paitan Ramen, but I hear the Tsukemen is bomb as well (chilled ramen separated from the broth). There's not too many choices for additional toppings like soft boiled eggs or corn, but hey if the ramen tastes amazing by itself, who needs it? Just kidding I still want my soft boiled egg and corn.\n\nWe ordered oysters in shoyu dare oil for appetizers, and it was tasty. 4-5 pieces for $5 so not a bad deal. Once my Tori Paitan Double Chashu ($18) came out, I just stared at my ramen for a good 10 seconds. IT LOOKS SO GOOD. Okay looks are one thing, but let's taste the broth. DROOLS. A rich, thick, & creamy broth packed with a lot of flavor. It doesn't taste overly saturated with sodium at all. Double Chashu is so worth. Most of the flavors from the ramen came from the pork, and the chashu just melts in your mouth. The duck was good too, but it had a subtle lemon taste to it. Crispy bamboo shoots were a nice touch.\n\nThe hype couldn't be more real.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Reviewers and even other customers raved about how good the vegan ramen was and that may possibly be better than its meat-based brethren.\n\nWhile I liked it, it's definitely a once-in-a-while ramen because of how heavy and sodium laden it was. I'm parched as I'm writing this. \n\nThe best thing about the Tori Paitan Ramen was how tender the cha shu was. I don't know how they cook it so there's still a pink hue but it's amazing. The regular portion is pretty generous but if you love pork, you might want to pay extra for the double portion.\n\nWith both ramen types, the broths were super heavy in flavor so how much you like this place may depend on how you like your ramen.

Nonetheless, my friends and I decided to wait 1.5 hours in line to try the ramen. I mean there has to be a reason why everyone else is also waiting in line. This place just opened around 3 weeks ago, and the chain is straight from Tokyo. Honestly, they should really expand their venue considering how amazingly popular they are! They only have about 4 bar tables that seat 6 people and a small area that seats about 3-4 people. If you come here alone, you could probably skip most of the line!\n\nThe service here is really great. The host was really friendly and even remembered our names! He also brought the chef out to meet us and the chef was so adorable and sweet. The staff honestly believes the vegan ramen is the best one, and if you really love meat you can add meat to the ramen. Both my friends went for the vegan ramen, but once I saw that it contained 7 types of nuts, I didn't order it considering I'm allergic to a couple types of nuts. I went with the most popular Tori Paitan Ramen with double chashu. WOW this was definitely the creamiest ramen I've ever had, and the noodles themselves were the best tasting ramen noodles I've ever eaten. They were very thick and chewy and the broth was very very rich and creamy. This was definitely one-of-a-kind ramen!\n\nIf ramen is like this in Tokyo, I'm definitely going to have to pay a visit to Japan soon!

First impression when sipping it was that it was very rich and almost even gritty since it was so thick. I warmed up to it after several bites and having it together with the noodles and the other ingredients. At the end, it made me feel pretty gross though. \n\nNoodles: Springy, my favorite type. \n\nChasu: Two types of chasu, pork and duck, both thinly sliced, both had great flavor. \n\nEgg: Shoyu egg, flavorful where you can actually taste the soy sauce marinade. Perfectly soft-boiled\n\nOther: Bamboo shoots tasted a bit more fermented than what I was used to but still good. The fried onions, kale, and cabbage were good additions as it added different complimenting textures and flavors to the dish. Fried garlic was a waste of an add for 2 dollars more as I felt it didn't add that much to the dish. \n\nWait time: 10 minutes; Came 10 minutes before opening on a Tuesday and there was already a small line in front but was able to get in with the first wave of people. \n\nService: Waitresses were friendly and knowledgeable about the ramen.

I don't mind, as long as I have elbow room and have good food!\n\nWhile in line, we checked out the menu and had a face palm moment when I realized that the description described the items below. Basically, the items below the header start with the basic bowl, and increase in price for additional items. So the four categories are: tori paitan (most ordered based on pictures and reviews), shoyu (what I ordered), shio, and vegan tantanmen.\n\nWhen the shoyu ramen arrived, I quickly dug in because I was so hungry. The duck chasu and pork chasu was tender, perfectly cooked, and enhanced the broth (wishing there were doubles of each!). Even the kale was an unusual, but nice addition. The broth was perfect, not salty or oily. And the noodles were chewy! At first, it doesn't look like there's a lot of noodles, but the bowl is shaped quite deeply at the bottom, so all the noodles are hidden there. There was so much I liked about this ramen. \n\nI couldn't figure out what the seasonings on the table were, though there was pink himalayan salt, and maybe some other seasonings to personally enhance the broth to the right taste. I didn't need to as I liked it the way it was.\n\nThe waiter was very kind and smiling, which is something I don't see too often. All the seating is on stools, and there are baskets on the ground for bags. The whole inside has a clean and modern aesthetic, with a living wall at the entrance, descriptions of the different types of ramen, and a view into the kitchen. So exciting!\n\nOne downside is that this isn't a place to sit and chat after you've eaten the food. Somebody will kindly let you know that there are other patrons outside who are waiting.\n\nIt's hard to say if I would wait in line for another hour, but I would come back to arrive right around opening so I don't have to wait so long.

But it's worth it. \n\nMensho Tokyo opens at 5pm and so my friend and I came here at exactly 5pm. There was already a long line waiting outside the restaurant. Were they there since 4pm or just five minutes ago? I have no clue but 5 minutes later, half of the line went in so my heart skipped a beat at the possibility of having my wait time reduced in half. Even then, we waited for at least another hour and 15 minutes until we were finally seated. At reaching the top of the line, there was still a good thirty people behind us. \n\nThere is no wait list to put your name down or reservations. You do it the good old fashioned stand and wait your turn. Finding parking in this area can be a hassle but there is parking across the street that is free and available after 6pm assuming you can snag the spot (it is a no stopping zone before 6pm). The restaurant is quite small and there's two rows of tables. The front row was one long table and the back row near the windows was sectioned off into two separate tables. It's communal seating so you may be sitting with other parties if you are a small group. I was sitting in the back row near the windows and our table seated 7 so our party of 3 was seated with two other parties of 2. If you're eating by yourself, you may be lucky enough to move up in line since you can sit with the odd number groups. \n\nWe ordered the oysters in shoyu dare oil to share and for myself, I got the tori paitan ramen with double chashu (because dammit, I waited too long in line to limit myself). \n\nOysters: For $5, you get four pieces although I counted five unless one oyster cloned itself. They're really tiny pieces and the Yelp photos are a lie when you see the close-up and think it's bigger than it really is (so sorry, my photo is now a lie). It's a little salty but still kind of tasty if you're into oysters. I'm definitely used to raw oysters with the lemon and marinara so it was a bit strange to taste cooked oysters in soy sauce. A good starting appetizer as you wait for your ramen. \n\nTori Paitan Ramen (Double Chashu) $18: WOW! The chicken broth was so rich and creamy. I would expect it to be salty judging from the look of it but it wasn't although it was SUPER FLAVORFUL. In fact, most of the salty taste came from the pork chashu. The pork chashu broke apart easily with my chopsticks and melts in my mouth with each bite. Duck chashu was interesting since it had a slight lemon-y flavor. I definitely enjoyed the pork more. The noodles were thick (chow mein thick) and chewy. You get a big silver ladle spoon so you can spoon up both the delicious broth along with your thick noodles.\n\nBe prepared to open up your wallet and drop almost $20 a person. With three bowls of ramen and oysters, we paid about $75 with tax and tips. Thankfully it's not cash only and they do take card. To the side of the restaurant, they have a single unisex bathroom that is quite spacious for such a small restaurant.", "author": "Diana C."}

By 4:30 pm, the line was growing. We only waited an hour compared to some of the crazy 3 hours that other people have waited. All 4 of us ordered the tori paitan ramen ($16), which was seemingly the most popular! We were all really excited especially just to be some of the first people in the restaurant. \n\nThe tori paitan was incredibly flavorful, creamy, and THICK! Like others have said, the tori paitan broth has more of a sauce or gravy-like consistency rather than your normal thinner broth. If you don't like heavy meals... don't get the tori paitan. You're probably better off with the lighter shoyu or shio ramen (both look delicious!). The tori paitan broth got a bit too rich as I was finishing the bowl. However, I enjoyed it! I normally order tonkotsu at ramen places, so the chicken flavor was definitely something different to try out. \n\nThe noodles are round and thicker than your average (think chow mein noodle size), but perfectly cooked and chewy. As for the toppings, the chasu was melt in your mouth delicious, but the duck was subpar for me. My friends and I also thought there should be a little more veggies just to lighten up the heavy bowl. I liked the bonito flakes, but the small amounts of kale and bamboo shoots did not cut it for us. But we did really like the toppings on the tables! The red salt was something we'd never seen before, and the other brown seasoning (smells like bonito flakes) was pretty tasty.\n\nBy the time we left at 6 pm, the line outside was crazy! If you don't like waiting, definitely don't come around that time. You're better off coming anywhere from 4-4:30 pm. The restaurant seats less than 30 people at one time, and it seems like there's a slow turnover rate. Mensho was good, but I probably wouldn't wait 2-3 hours for it.", "author": "Tara A."}

The tori paitan is a solid ramen, rich broth (a little on the salty side), chewy noodles, fall-apart-chashu pieces and some garnish. It's definitely not worth $20 (incl. tip & tax) though. I just don't think it's special enough to warrant the wait and price. The spicy miso lamb ramen is more unique - it's definitely spicy enough to make you sweat, and the lamb is cooked really well.

The most unique is the spicy lamb, and I 100% would recommend! The broth is very thick, creamy texture with ground lamb pieces and crunchy bean sprouts.

Luckily, it was only about 25 mins wait.\n\nAuthentic tori-paitan ramen is a very difficult type of ramen to find in U.S. So no hesitation for me, I ordered it right away.\nMy ramen came out pretty quickly, piping hot. The creamy chicken soup blew me away. Very complex, flavorful, savory, rich and light at the same time, which is crazy!  \nThick noodles were perfectly cooked, slightly al dente and matches marvelously well with creamy soup.\n\nPork chashu has delicate flavor and literally melted in my mouth.

We arrived around 8:30 pm on a Sunday evening, and the wait was most definitely real. It took us an hour to get into the restaurant, but only about ten minutes between getting seated and getting our bowl of delicious ramen served to us.\n\nAnyways, while I wanted so badly to believe that Mensho was going to be the bomb.com, I found myself enjoying the bowl of ramen greatly, though unlikely to ever return back (well, maybe if the lines die down).\n\nThe current Mensho menu that everyone posts on the wall is actually an aspirational menu--we chatted with the waitresses and apparently they won't really be serving tsukemen until at least May/June. I was bummed out because the Bay Area has a real shortage of good tsukemen (besides Iza); they currently are serving a Vegan tsukemen if you're into that, but relative to their more popular dishes, I feel like most people are more inclined to try their more popular dishes. We got the following dishes -- I'll do broth and overall reviews and then noodle and content reviews since both bowls basically served the same thing:\n\nChicken paitan -- the must have for everyone who comes here. I really was not a fan of the chicken paitan. If you love your broths thick and creamy, this is the ramen for you. SO described it like a creamy chicken noodle soup -- flavor was rich, but not particularly nuanced or complex. Overall, easy to have a couple bites of, but you better have a high tolerance for creaminess, otherwise this dish is going to be hard to finish.\n\nOrganic shoyu -- I enjoyed this and actually found it be a good ramen. The broth is very light, perhaps salty, but I have a high tolerance for saltiness so I'm not a great judge of that. I thought the flavor was quite delicious, though the soup itself was definitely quite oily. Overall, I enjoyed it, and would have again. The noodles were interesting because they were flat noodles with speckles on it.... never seen that before, but they worked well with the soup.\n\nOverall, noodles for both dishes were good -- they were appropriate complements to their soup base. The contents of the dish were interesting -- the chasu is good, but what I particularly enjoyed was the duck chasu, which I've never had before. I like duck to start with, so it was a nice textural shift to what people are normally used to in ramen. \n\nI was impressed with the careful attention to detail -- they served the chicken paitan with a wooden spoon and the organic shoyu with a flat metal one, perhaps because the flat metal one wouldn't have been quite as appropriate for the creamy paitan, but maybe we were overthinking it. \n\nFinal price was $40, so definitely on the higher end, but given how expensive everything in the city is, I was pretty happy to have a $40 meal.\n\nOverall, I found the ramen to be fairly good here, maybe not the best ever, but given the ridiculous wait times, it's hard to want to come back because it's not good enough to wait an hour for. Ippudo is also opening in Berkeley within the year, so will be interesting to see how these two big Japanese ramen stores do when they're all situated.\n\ntldr; certainly good ramen with a higher price, but you will likely have to wait an hour for it -- I wouldn't do it again, but I did like the ramen. just didn't like it THAT much.", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Ok, not just \"toast\" but phuckin' bougie, tweezified toast. \n\nThis year, it's $15 coffee (for one cup!) and $18 ramen.\n\nBecause, San Francisco! \n\nNext year, I'm bracing myself for $100 pizza. Oh wait, we already had that during the super bowl (well, I didn't but it was available at Tony's Pizza Napoletana). \n\nSeriously, what's next? \n\nKindly let me know so I can start harvesting my eggs to sell! \n\n$18 ramen may sound crazy but people waited 3+ hours for this ramen on opening night! \n\n$18 for a taste of Tokyo? Why not! \n\nMensho's first U.S. location is one of the most, if not the most highly anticipated restaurant opening this year in SF! \n\nTip: Come at 4 pm (earlier on the weekends) or after 10 pm to avoid long wait times. \n\nCurrently, Mensho has 4 ramen options available ($9-$18) with a single or double chashu option. When the owner returns from Japan in March, their menu will expand. No housemade noodles yet. They have a noodle machine but are awaiting permit(s) to use it (same for the tonkotsu equipment). Disappointingly no marinated soft boiled egg is available but maybe in the future? Beer only; no sake, soda, or juice.\n\nMy friend and I ordered three bowls of ramen to share:\n\n(1) Tori Paitan: Rich, creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce | double chashu $18\nhttp://bit.ly/1XrzETT\n\nOur favorite of the three, the kotteri broth was deliciously creamy (gravy-like) and richly satisfying. It had great depth of umami flavor but did get a bit gritty mid-way. The al-dente noodles were thick, springy, and had a fantastic toothsome chew. \n\nThe chashu is sublime so pony up the extra $ and double up on it! The pork chashu is melt-in-your-mouth tender, like pork butter. It's so ridiculously tender, it falls apart when you pick it up. The duck chashu is silky smooth and chews effortlessly.\n\nThe only other ramen shop that offers Tori Paitan is Nojo Ramen Tavern (that I'm aware of). I tried Nojo's last night and there's absolutely no comparison. Mensho's is infinitely superior. \n\n(2) Organic Shoyu: Organic chicken + pork soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori | double chashu $16\nhttp://bit.ly/1QfmuKm\n\nA much lighter assari broth but saltier with a slight sweetness since it's a soy sauce based. The duo of chashu were perfection just like in the Tori Paitan ramen. I didn't like the noodles which were overcooked, flat, and lacked chew. \n\n(3) Shio: Organic chicken + pork soup, shio dare, pork chashu, kale, menma, chives, fried garlic, nori | double chashu $11\nhttp://bit.ly/1Loeijq\n\nThe most affordable bowl available, the shio ramen was simple and pure. The assari broth was light and salty but still had depth. Same delicious chashu as the other bowls but the noodles were disappointing like the shoyu ramen. In this bowl, not only were the noodles overcooked, there were two clumps. *sad pouty lip*\n\n(4) Vegan Tantanmen | $18\nI'm kicking myself for NOT ordering this too because I love nuts! The broth contains soy cream and 7 kinds of nuts, producing a creamy kotteri broth that looked similar to the Tori Paitan.\n\nI washed everything down with a Sansho beer ($11.75): http://bit.ly/1Px6vnx. Beer usually tastes like carbonated piss to me but this one was refreshing with a gingery lemon spice. Loved it but not the price. \n\nService is a work in progress which is understandable since this is Mensho's first foray in the U.S.. They only let 8 or so customers in at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen. They don't fire up orders by tickets, instead they prepare the ramen by type (they really should do the former). We received our order at different times and after people who ordered after us. If your companion(s) orders different ramen than yourself, be prepared to start eating first before the noodles get soggy. \n\nWhen I was line I met one of the restaurant partners, Abram aka Ramen Beast. He was uber nice and offered to answer any questions I had. Really cool guy! \n\nThe space is small and only seats 28 - two communal tables and four seats at the counter. We choose to sit at the counter. There's more privacy (if you're on a date) and you can watch the chefs in action.\n\nRead all signs before parking.

It was filled with mouthwatering noodles, tender Duck and Pork Chashu, Kale, Menma, Burdock and Katsuobushi Sauce. The broth itself was rich, creamy and just overall yummy. It was piping hot too, which was a plus. Unfortunately, there wasn't an option to add a soft boiled egg yet.

Another customer came up behind us and said with a surprised tone, 'There's no line!?' I just told him that we're the line. I was confused too because I thought, why would there be? But now that I've actually seen the reviews and pictures... I now get it. Didn't realize this spot was THAT poppin' lol. I'm always wary about restaurants that have crazy lines - usually it doesn't meet the hype... not for me at least.\n\nWe were seated in no time. I love the communal tables! And I actually really like the small space haha, reminds me of a lot of shops I've been in throughout Asia.\n\nSince I had just burned through my wallet on drinks, I opted for the lower priced Shio Ramen w/ Chasiu ($9 something, ~$11 w/ tip and tax). Food came out surprisingly fast. I was kinda sad that there wasn't much in my bowl. Everything was delicious but I want a lot more for the price! Everything definitely tasted top quality but when you only get one piece of meat, it kinda has you scratching your head. Broth was great. Looks like I should have gotten the Tori Paitan since everyone on here is raving about that one's broth.\n\nI'll stick to my cheap, hefty ramen shops for now. I like quality and quantity - but, this was definitely a nice treat for one splurge-y night!", "author": "Shanise M."}

The hours-long waits certainly suggest as much!\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nI have a deep seated dislike for long waits when it comes to food, with a rage that starts to simmer around the 30-60 minute mark, depending on the quality of the company I'm with. For this reason, despite hearing all the wild raving about how amazing Mensho was, I refused to come during prime dinner time, what with the purported 2-3 hour waits.\n\nBut, it so happened that on one chilly night several weeks ago, after a date that ended earlier than expected, and that I hadn't eaten prior to, Mensho was still open, and screaming my name. So along I came, waiting for a meager 20 minutes* before being seated, having my order taken, and my toripaitan served, all within the span of another 10 minutes.\n\nAnd, I mean, what else is there to say? It was amazing: a rich, creamy, tasty chicken broth, and one of the only I've actually felt compelled to finish drinking; ramen noodles that were cooked to just the right springy consistency; and overall, a perfect combination of amazing flavors.\n\nDefinitely plan to be back, schedule permitting, because, amazing as this may be, I still refuse to wait with the masses.\n\n* See venue accessibility for additional notes on this\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - The place itself is pretty small, with some lower counter seating that fits four, and two long high top townhall style tables.

I wish it was less rich tbh. \n- Noodles were delicious. Thick noodles with a nice bite to it. I believe they make their own but not 100% sure about that. Either way I would come back just for their noodles!! They should have the option to add extra noodles! Although I was pretty full after this prob bc of the broth lol \n- Chasu was good with the right amount of fat.\n- Duck - good, flavorful \n- Bamboo - comes with bamboo!

Their Tori Paitan is so incredibly luxurious and rich it's almost too much goodness in a bowl. Not going to lie, you will probably feel like crap after a while but at least you get some joy before the regret.\n\nCame on a weekend for dinner with a friend. I arrived about 30 minutes early and was able to get in after about 50 minutes of waiting (including the early half hour). The shop itself is very small and has very few seats. The seats that are there are honestly very uncomfortable. The tables are communal style and since they're high chairs I kept feeling like I was going to fall off and knock someone over. However, the product may be worth at least some of the suffering. This soup is so delicious, I can't believe they didn't just dump cream into it. I do find it a bit salty but I usually do. The noodles had a great bite to them as well. The chashu was good and bad. The fatty portions were tender and delicious but the rest was just average. Overall a delicious bowl of ramen but wish there were more items to help lighten it a bit.\n\nI also ordered the oysters appetizer. I'm going to be frank. I did not enjoy these at all. I didn't quite know what to expect. It seems to be cured in shoyu so it has almost a liver/kidney like texture but much saltier. I could see myself enjoying this with a big bowl of plain porridge but it is not enjoyable at all when it's accompanying a bowl of salty rich ramen.\n\nOverall, the seating is miserable, the wait is miserable, and the price isn't great, but the ramen itself is good. While there are better places out there, they really do make one heck of a broth here.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I figured if we couldn't see Alicia Keys for free, we should try and at least try some authentic ramen. \n\nAlicia Keys was a no since it was wayy over capacity. So me and the bf headed on over to Mensho Tokyo. We arrived at 5:30 and the line was fairly long ( I think there was about 70 people in front of us?). But I was determined to try it! \n\nAfter 3.5 hours standing outside in line (this was by far the longest I have ever waited for anything, so the expectations were high!) we were finally in front of the door and we were seated at the bar in the back. In my opinion, those 4 seats are the best seats in the house! You don't have eager people staring at you the entire time you're eating and you're seating facing the kitchen!\n\nDrink orders were taken and we immediately placed our order for ramen. I ordered the Tori Paitan Ramen and bf ordered the same thing with chashu (to this day I kick myself for not ordering something different but at the time I wanted to try their most popular dish and wasn't sure if I would be happy just having half). \n\nThis was my first time having paitan ramen and I loved it! So incredibly rich and flavorful, almost gravy like. The noodles were thick and chewy, by far the best I've ever had! I'm not a fan of pork and usually don't eat it, but the chasu was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Super tender and melt in your mouth. All the components that came in the bowl complimented each other well and it indeed, was a spectacular bowl of ramen. \n\nWas it worth the 3.5 hour wait? Yes, I believe it was. It was also the most expensive bowl of ramen I've ever paid for, but I think it was worth it as well. \n\nIf you're willing to wait, then come here!!!

I almost  regard that as a paste. The taste was super rich and flavorful yet non-oily nor too salty. After weeks I still remember how the soup tasted like. It came with both pork and duck chashu; pork was tender as expected but the duck was surprisingly juicy as well. The noodle was also one of the thickest I have tried with spongy texture. The whole presentation definitely makes this the best ramen I have ever tried in the US without a doubt. With double chashu this ramen cost $18, SF price on the high side.\n\nSansho Beer: B+.\nYes, I did order that $11.75/11.5oz beer. How could a beer be so expensive I was thinking. Well, it did have its own unique flavor - it's an interesting combination of herbs, peppercorn into a beer, and it did go well with the thick ramen soup in a way that it flushed out the soup taste from the last bite so that every next bite was new and refreshing. But after all, I still have to say this beer is VERY expensive.\n\nI absolutely cannot wait to go back either to get the same ramen again, or the Tantanmen looks very interesting to me too.", "author": "Simon C."}

I've been following the Mensho opening for a few months and for the past few two months I've walked past it every week to monitor the progress of their construction/opening. Finally saw their plans to open up in February, but each time we thought about going, the lines were overwhelming so I made it a plan to come here on a weeknight 30 minutes before opening.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best ramens I've ever had - it's delicate but delicious and exploding in flavor. The SHIO ($9 or $11 with DOUBLE Pork) tasted so clean but I loved the chewy, al dente noodles. The pork melted in my mouth and I didn't even need to sink my teeth in the meat whatsoever. The Tori Paitan ($16 or $18 with DOUBLE Pork/Duck) is super frothy and tasty - the broth was super thick, almost  like a flavorful sauce. The DUCK was mind-blowingly good. I haven't had duck so tender in so long.\n\nThe restaurant is casual but comfortable. With the exception of the 4 seats at the \"bar\" (low seats), most of these tables are communal and you're obligated to share your place with others- so come here for a casual meal with close friends/loved ones - probably not the best location for a business meeting or something of that nature.\n\nThey do have a 1-hour limit BUT they serve beer so they ultimately let you enjoy your meal/drinks and don't rush you at all.

Had to restrain myself. The ramen was pretty simple with the toppings. In addition to the chashu, toppings came with lettuce, kale, chives, and what I think was fried garlic skin?

Unfortunately he didn't like his dish and it's because it had a very fishy flavor. He asked me to try it and I could immediately smell the fish scent. Neither of us like fish but we didn't know this dish would have fish flavor since it didn't mention it anywhere in the entree description. My husband asked our server if there was fish in the ramen and she confirmed yes, and that a good way to indicate that is if you see Nori as one of the ingredients.

Perfectly cooked, good flavor\n-Tori Paitan (creamy chicken broth with duck and pork chashu)- Creamy thick broth not salty at all which is a plus, chewy noodles, two pieces of duck, plenty of pork, empty bowl.\n\nService, excellent.

The duck chashu is amazingly tender and differentiates itself from other ramen shops. I have waited from 30 to 90 minutes in the past - would recommend going earlier rather than later in the day to minimize wait times. They require you stand outside unfortunately so you better bring some entertainment! The shop has only a few seats maybe 20 or so. Clam ramen only had 10 bowls a day so come early if you want a bite! Sadly they didn't have egg and cilantro when we went. I would only minus a star because of the lack of supplies. We got fried garlic which came in small crunchy pieces which I recommend. It's two dollars for most additions which is pricey. They have complimentary crushed fish flake powder on the side on the table as well.\n\nService was overall good although they seemed to be rushing us right when we sat down!

Mensho does not take any reservations and no name on the clipboard. You have to wait in line for your turn and your entire party has to be present in order to be seated. This place is tiny, I mean tiny, capacity at 49 with 4 communal tables and a bar seating area that holds 4. They limit each table to 1 hr for their meal so that the line can move.\n\nI went on a Wednesday night, lined up around 8 pm and waiting about 1.5 hrs. We had 6 people but split into 2 groups of 3.\n\nThey offer 4 types of ramen and a couple tsukemen and soba options ranging $9+. They also offer beer, no sake yet. Draft and asahi starts at around $6 and the imported fancier beers are $10+.\n\nEveryone ordered the Tori Paitan ($16, additional $2 for double the chashu). The soup was creamy, rich, and just phenomenal. Best ramen soup ever! The noodles were a perfect al dente and had a good chew, but I still can't wait for the fresh housemade noodles. The chashu was the star of the dish. Just the perfect amount of fat and cooked to perfection, so soft and tender. It literally melted in my mouth so fast I was regretting not ordering extra. The duck was also delicious, very tender and comes medium rare, that beautiful pink. It comes with some bonito flakes and cabbage. On the table they have some dried plum salt and bonito powder to complement your ramen. \n\nHowever, to make this bowl of ramen complete, it's missing the marinated soft boiled egg.\n\nThis is one place I would highly recommend everyone lining up for and trying at least once.

I went here on a Thursday night around 10:00pm and was seated in about 1 hour (for a party of 2). When we left the restaurant, the line was just as long as when we first got there.  I liked the ramen here so much that I came back again the next day. \n\nTori Paitan - http://tinyurl.com/zmhmezu\nAmazingly thick and rich broth that has a strong chicken flavor. The first couple bites of this ramen is just heavenly. Then the richness gets to be a bit too much after a while. I could barely finish my bowl! The ramen came with two thin slices of pork chashu and duck chashu. The pork slices were very tender and the duck was cooked closer to medium than well - which is unusual for asian cuisine. The main flavor in both types of meat was the meat itself, not the typical chashu flavor. The burdock roots were thinly crispy and thinly sliced, which really added to the texture of the whole dish. The noodles were thick and average in terms of taste. I really liked this ramen as a whole. I felt kind of bad after finishing it because it was overwhelmingly rich and fatty. \n\nVegan Tantanmen - http://tinyurl.com/h29wb6x\nOverall, I liked this ramen more than the Tori Paitan. It still had a rich broth, but not so overwhelmingly rich that it made me feel bad after finishing it. The broth tasted like a combination of peanuts and sesame. There were a couple drops of spicy chili oil in the soup was only slightly spicy.\n\nOysters in Dare Shoyu Sauce - http://tinyurl.com/ztsb6kt\nThis is the only appetizer here. I don't eat oysters often and I've never had it cooked so this was a completely new dish to me. The order came with 6 pieces of oysters even though the menu says it's supposed to be 3 pieces. The oysters were well braised and topped with chives. (The 2nd time I came back, I saw an order of oysters topped with sprouts instead of chives so they probably change up the toppings). Taste wise, it kind of reminded me of chicken gizzard or heart. I wasn't super in love with this dish but I'm pretty sure that's just because I'm not a huge fan of oysters.\n\nYou can ask for a side of chili oil if you want to add some spice to your ramen.

Everyone was talking about Mensho and after yelping it, knew this had to be my next stop. I mean 4 stars with over 1k reviews... I had to see what this place was about. All I can say is that I was utterly disappointed.\n\nCame here on a Sunday night, 30 minutes after opening, and ended up waiting an hour to be seated. \n\nThe restaurant itself:\n- Seats about 25-30 people at a time. There's one long table and two medium sized tables. All communal tables. Be prepared to get really up close and personal to the parties next to you. You'll probably even learn a lot about them by unintentionally eavesdropping on their conversations. Since everyone is using both their hands to eat, you'll get some elbow bumping every now and then.\n- Everyone is seated on a stool. After waiting an hour in line... We all could use some back support! So I do not recommend bringing in your grandparents or young children here to eat...\n- There's a huge window by the two smaller tables in front where hangry costumers constantly glare into your soul. You can read their eyes and you know they're saying \"hurry the f up\". Does not make for a good eating experience if you ask me.\n\nThe food:\n- Enoki mushroom chips ($6): Honestly the best thing I had here and it wasn't even that great. I wish it came with japanese mayo or an aioli of some sort. But it just came with a lemon and some mixed chilli pepper powder that you could sprinkle on top of the enoki. This is the same pepper flakes you top your ramen off with. At least they were super crispy and arrived to the table quickly. \n- Spicy and regular paitan ramen (~$17): My friend and I were straight up disappointed of the ramen. First off, I didn't know I ordered chowder with my ramen. The broth was so thick... Seriously like the consistency of chowder or even thanksgiving gravy. No wonder they give you a spoon as big as a ladle to eat the ramen. The broth tasted bleh... I just couldn't get past the thickness. The noodles were thick and perfect in consistency tho, so that's good. Used my huge ladle and found clumps of spice at the bottom of my bowl. No wonder why it wasn't spicy... The spice just sat there in the bottom. The meat was aiiight, pretty big pieces.\n\nOne word to describe my overall experience would be: disappointing. Waited an hour to get seated just to feel rushed while eating. I felt uncomfortable being so close to the strangers next to me while talking to my friend and eating. I cannot believe I paid over $15 for my bowl of ramen. It didn't taste good at all:( I'm all about ramen so I'm genuinely sad because I really wanted to like this place the way everyone else seems to. \n\nPro:\n- Super quick. Only because they want you in and out quickly so they can accommodate those lined up outside b/c they know they're getting impatient. \n\nCons: \n- Long line if you don't plan to stand in line 30-45 minute before opening\n- Get ready to get your personal bubble popped by strangers sitting to your left and right. Not enough personal space to thoroughly enjoy a meal. \n- The broth was the consistency of chowder/gravy. I'm a texture person and this really distracted my taste buds.\n- Steep prices for ramen. Expect to pay $16-18 and at least an extra dollar for add-ons.\n- Hangry customers waiting outside watching you slurp your ramen. Can I get an \"awkward!\"???\n\nThank goodness for the enoki chips or else I would've given this place one star.

It's not a massive bowl, because he ended up eating my dish as well and it's not that great. \n\nI will say the Vegan option is pretty good. It is very hard to find a ramen place that doesn't jip you all because you are vegetarian or vegan. I can see why vegetarians go nuts for this place. I personally would recommend this dish to anyone even if you are not vegetarian. The saltiness of the Paitan was just too much. \n\nThe line is usually a 30 -45 minute wait and go with one or two other people.

The restaurant started seating people at around 5:20 pm. We ended up being seated around at 7:00 pm and we finished our meal around 7:30 pm. This is probably the longest line-up I've waited for for a ramen place in my entire life. Would I do this again? No.\n\nWe ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and the Chashu Miso Ramen, which both only have 30 servings available each day according to the menu. The Spicy Miso Ramen was quite spicy. The broth was a mixture of chicken and pork. The ramen itself was unique and different due to the ingredients used (chicken broth, tomatoes, cilantro, etc...). We enjoyed it, but it's not ramen I'd wait over 30 minutes for. Probably a better idea to come on a weeknight when it's not busy.", "author": "Alex C."}

But I will say that if you go here, you will be buying for yourself something that is very, very nice, and you will enjoy it.

I even waited in a relatively short (in comparison) two hour line at that crazy ramen festival.. and this is hands down the best ramen I've had. \n\nYes i still had to wait in a line but still it was only about 30 minutes long and the weather was nice and I had great company so the line flew by.  It helps that Mensho is an organized and well run establishment. I appreciate their efficiency in getting people in and out without feeling overly rushed. \n\nThe place is pretty small but they use every little bit of it with community seating. The menu is simple with few choices which I love. I assume their limited menu means they put a lot more thought into the few things they make. \n\nI asked the waitress what was most popular. She said the Tori Paitan and Vegan Tantanmen. My friend and I decided to try both. They were amazing! The tori paitan was rich and delicious. The Vegan tantanmen was spicy in all the right ways. Everything about it was just right.

Came 25 minutes before open on Sunday, was the first batch of people seated, and received ramen around 5:30. Vegan tantanmen had amazing depth of flavor, even better than the broth in the tori paitan. Chashu in the tori paitan was probably some of the best I've ever had. Only critique is that the noodles are pretty thick and air on the side of being too dense/chewy. \n\nCons: very loud edm made it hard to carry on a conversation, tall bar stools were uncomfortable to sit on, very very close proximity to other people so it was awkward getting food before them (in your peripheral they'd stare and watch you try it) and people waiting in line outside kept gazing around inside waiting to get seated \n\nDon't get me wrong, this is really solid ramen with excellent depth of flavor.

Not a lot of ramen shops serve tori paitan so when I saw it here, I knew I wanted that.  I missed the first group of people being seated so waited about 45 minutes until a seat was ready for me.  They only have communal tables and everyone, no matter how big or small your group is, shares the table.\nGot me my tori paitan which came out super hot, broth was thick, milky and flavorful.  Noodles were thick and al dente.  It comes with a slice of tender fatty cha sui and 2 slices of medium rare duck slices.  It was loaded with bamboo shoots and a few kale for some green.  \nI can slurp this ramen everyday, especially this 60 degrees sf weather! \nThey have vegan options and light broths like shio and even dipping ramens. \nDefinitely bringing friends here next time to try more! \nLine fills up fast.. and you would think, a bowl of ramen should only take no more than 10 mins to slurp down in Japan... but be prepared to wait 45 mins to an hour or more!

I'd say it was generally worth it-- very rich & hearty vegan ramens & suntory drafts definitely hit the spot! The enoki mushroom dish is tasty as well. The vibe of the place is cozy albeit very small and simple, but I'd say part of the fun is the hype/just looking out the window and seeing a line of people waiting (even on a Sunday night)! On the pricey side if you want to eat & drink, but I'd come back just for the vegan ramen if I was craving something hot and filling. Though I wouldn't come on a crazy busy night like Friday or Saturday and wait more than 30 minutes. \n\nWhat holds this place up is the energy and intensity of the chefs and the ramen itself being so freshly made and above par. It's not so much about connecting with servers as there almost seems to be a rushed feeling, but I understand there is somewhat of a pressure to get to everyone in line.", "author": "Carolyn S."}

Tomoharu Shono partnered with ramen critique Abram Plaut (the gentleman that mans the door) to bring Mensho stateside.  The restaurant probably holds no more than 30 people at a time, but the limited space doesn't make you feel like you're on the #38 during rush hour.  There is enough elbow room to wiggle around.  \n\nThe service is extremely polite and friendly.  The servers and cooks work like a well oiled machine, churning out hot delicious bowls of ramen here.  I ordered the Tori Paitan (totally sounds like a football player) ramen with a double helping of pork and duck chashu.  I will say it now, this was probably the best ramen I've ever had.  Shono is credited for creating ramen dishes with unique ingredients.  The addition of braised kale, duck chaschu, and some sort of thinly sliced deep fried chip was a unique concept.  There wasn't a single ingredient that tasted out of place.  All the ingredients were cooked well, meaning, the fried chips were crispy, the chaschu was tender, and of course, the noodles had great tenacity to them.  The broth didn't have a charred or bitter flavor.  It was fatty, rich, and full bodied.  \n\nGyoza lovers, hang in there!  Plaut said he definitely wants to bring gyoza to the menu, but would first like to get things up and running fully before creating additions.  \n\nI really enjoyed my bowl of ramen at Mensho and would highly recommend it to those that are willing to wait.  I got there maybe 15 minuted before they opened and waited 45 minutes total.  The line moved pretty fast.  Go slurp and enjoy some awesome ramen!", "author": "Josh S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-07", "description": "I've passed this place a couple of times and there's ALWAYS a long line (at least 10+ people) but this time friend and I got there around 8:15ishPM and we waited about 15-20 mins - there were 4-5 groups in front of us. Mostly pairs of people. We got to the front of the line and there's a menu on a podium. There was a note that this is a \"Gratuity Free\" restaurant - a flat rate of 15% is added to all diners check. This was a little off putting at first but I came to agree with the flat rate percentage. I'll make more comments further below to support my decision.\n\nAmbiance and seating:\n\nGreat ambiance. They have three main tables: the largest seating 10-12 individuals and the other two tables seat 6 people each. The tables are elevated and have barstool seats. The tables are interesting in a sense that there's a gap built into the table, large enough to slide a thin-ish purse (anything wider than 3 inches might not fit) or a wallet and phone into the space if you don't want to put your purse on the floor. There is a coat hook by the door (I believe another person posted a photo of this). My friend and I were seated across from each over and next to us was another pair. Seating is a shared experience - most people seem to be seated across from their partner with exception of one pair that sat side to side. The fact that they only have three tables sort of suggests this. The ambiance is very welcoming, bright, and clean. Lots of chatter and you may need to raise your voice a little bit to hear your friend/SO, but definitely nice. Music in the background seemed pretty varied. It wasn't stuck on a specific radio with one type of music. There was also a TV mounted above the rest room, but it was playing on mute and no captions. It appeared to be on a loop and I believe it was more of an infomercial for the restaurant (?) - unclear.\n\nThe FOOD:\n\nFriend and I ordered the same thing: the Tori Paitan Ramen with a soy sauce egg (+$1.80/each). Menu doesn't offer that ramen as spicy but you can request Habanero (+$2/each) to spice it up - it came out in a slightly chopped/pulverized paste; makes it easier to mix into the broth in my opinion. We also ordered fried garlic (+$2) which came out in a diced form (see photo). I tried the broth first and it was sooooo delicious!! It had a milkier consistency than what I've had at other ramen places but the balance was great. It wasn't too salty nor under seasoned but just right. The chasiu was SO perfect - cooked to the point where it's falling apart when you try to bite down. I LOVED the texture and al dente-ness of the ramen. I personally prefer ramen noodles (and wonton noodles) with more of a resistance when I bite into it. I hate it when noodles are cooked to the point that they're falling apart when I pick them up with chop sticks. I cannot rave enough about their noodles!!! There were a few leaves of kale, some cabbage, bamboo shoots, and some fried/baked veg that I can't put my finger on that was also in the broth.I recognize the fried/baked beg but can't remember the name. At some point, friend and I weren't talking. We were slurping and eating intensely.\n\nThe drink menu consisted mostly of Asian (?) beers, sake, and soju. I don't believe any sodas were on the menu. Water is always an option \n\nThe SERVICE:\n\nGreat! There were three ladies taking orders,serving, and clearing tables. All of them were efficient and unobtrusive. Sometimes I feel very rushed or I'm waiting a long time to place my order but here, it felt like when I glanced around, one of the ladies immediately sensed my eyes and came right over. Everyone had a smile and was offering refills at a good rate. Food came out about 10 mins after ordering and when we were slowing down and coming to the end of our meal, I didn't feel pressured to hurry up, pay, and get out. We slowly savored the broth and when WE were done, someone came up and asked if they could take away our bowls - definitely appreciate the attention the servers give. Not too much but enough to know they're there. \n\nAll in all I would DEFINITELY come here again...I'll keep my fingers crossed that there won't be a hella long line.", "author": "Lenerd J."}

Pricey for ramen and also there's no egg, which is always one of my favorite things about ramen. :( Yes it's still good, but I'm not convinced it was worth pretty much $20.\n\nMy friend got the tonkatsu ramen, which was much much heavier. I liked the thicker noodles she got though!\n\nOverall, I'm really glad I tried the ramen here and think it's good.

I was skeptical at first but with one bite of the Tori Paitan ramen, my only thought was 'Whoa, that's good!'\n\nIt is a creamier, heavier broth than most ramen places but oh so very very flavorful. Also, the noodles were cooked perfectly. They were not soft and soogy which is a bit of a no no for me. Noodle texture is important. The kale was tasty too and a good veggie in the bowl.\n\nMy friend and I arrived at 645 pm on a Thursday night. There were about 12 people in front of us, but mostly couples so the line went by fast. We were seated about 25 minutes and happily slurping away our noodles about 10 minutes after that. It is a small place but the service is good and attentive when needed.\n\nOnly criticism is the price as I am not sure a bowl of ramen should be that much $ and also my cha-su was super fatty -too fatty for me to eat.

While walking to Mensho, we walked hurriedly up a super sketchy street (I would not want to be there without the light of day). \n\nWe got a good place in line and waited for the restaurant to open. While waiting we looked at our phones, and a Korean man waiting behind us loomed over our shoulders to look at our screens. He seemed genuinely interested in our Facebook news feeds. I took a photo of him undescreatly and he didn't seem to care. \n\nThe inside of the restaurant is designed beautifully. We all felt very cozy at our tabel. We took the opportunity to take more photographs with my DSLR. The menu has several different ramen options, including a vegan one for my vegetarian friend.

In tokyo, theres never a wait for mensho ramen. It takes people 5 min to be done and walk out. I averaged out the time it takes people to eat and walk out of this place is 30 min. Oh well, i guess the universe just revolves around these people...\nOne of the best ramen in the Bay Area. And of course, ramen traditions are preferential, people might like other types of noodles and other thickness of soup base. But this one, is a plain transverse from Mensho in Tokyo. Simply put, i will comment the ramen in this shop by its components.\nSoup: \npaitan soup base is thick and tasty, they put the real ingredients into making them and enough hours were  used in cooking the brooth. No chemical additives were tasted in these.\nLamb brooth gives a hint of lamb flavoring but its mostly covered by the spicyness of the soup, might be a little weak for lamb fanatics.\nShoyou brooth is as plain as you can get. Its a good choice if you dont feel like ingesting a heavy load for the night.\nNoodle:\nThick, wavy, medium softness. Wish they have different choices to choose for different brooth.\nMeat:\nChasiu was made from fine pig belly, not too distinctive between the fat and muscular layers, therefore its not too saturated for the taste. Thin cuts also made it easier for your stomach too, or else you will be needing Tums after dinner.\nOyster appetizer was great with the beer!!! Must try this original japanese izakaya appetizer.\n\nThis place is also a little pricey for ramen, but oh well this is sf.\n\nWill come back again if theres no wait... or maybe once a year...", "author": "Jason C."}

My thoughts are mixed. I really wanted to like it but I'm not 100% sold.\n\nOn to the review, the service was excellent and once we were in the restaurant we were seated and given menus but not rushed even though it was jam packed.\n\nThe menu is spartan and focuses on the ramen. I would love to return here once they have some more of what I consider necessary side staples such as karaage or takowasa. \n\nFirst, we had the tori paitan with extra chashu. The broth is very hearty and fatty (creamy taste always equals high fat content). The ramen was firm and held up well. However, where was my ajitsuke tamari!? This is Japanese for soft boiled egg and I am not sure why they don't also serve this as an option. My guess is this will be added later but it was sorely missed.\n\nSecond, we had shoyu ramen. I actually liked this better than the first bowl because the broth was lighter. Now, I did know what I was getting into by trying the fattier broth; however, if you are watching your figure or want something light stick to shoyu.\n\nFinally, we tried the appetizer oysters in shoyu dare oil because it was option one of two. The oysters were ok to me not bad but not amazing.\n\nIn sum, I was a bit disappointed because things that I consider fundamental to a good ramen experience and ramen dining experience were missing. Admittedly, the appetizers do not make the ramen but the ajitsuke surely does.\n\nI will have to return and give this place another after they introduce the full menu. \u9811\u5f35\u3063\u3066\u306d\uff01", "author": "Corey H."}

Yes, I'm a bit obsessed with ramen and friends nicknamed me \"Ramen Sheriff.\" Check out my ramen list attached :) \n\nSo when the talk of the town was that Mensho was everyone's new favorite ramen spot, I had to try it for myself. I tried 2 of their bowls at 2 different occasions: \n\n[May 2016]\nI ordered the Tori Paitan while my friend ordered the Shio. I got Tori Paitan because everyone raved about it - for me, it was very rich and flavorful, however too creamy and heavy for me. It didn't even taste like broth anymore, it was like a gravy sauce, which I was not a fan of. I was jealous of my friend's Shio because it was so flavorful and light. I gave my Tori Paitan 2.5 stars and he gave his 5. I do agree that the noodles are really good here though. Perfect texture and taste. \n\n[Oct 2016]\nDecided to give Mensho another chance. This time I ordered the Shio and my friend ordered the Organic Shoyu. Shio was much better than the Tori Paitan I ordered before, but I thought my bowl was a little bit salty. I tried the Shoyu which tasted similar to the Shio but with a kick of light soy sauce. Noodles were great again, pork was not bad, but flawed in the broth again. I was hoping second time around would have me agree with everyone else, but with the amount of ramen bowls I've had, I can't help but compare.\n\nOVERALL: Mensho has great texture and taste for their noodles and decent pork, however although their broths are unique and somewhat similar to Japan, it still does not quite hit the spot. If you really want authentic ramen, hit up Clint at Noodle in Haystack and reserve one of his pop up ramen dinners! It's the closest thing you'll get to Japan :)", "author": "Raquel Y."}

BUt it was delicious afterall... i do love the full body in the broth.  The noodles were cooked just right and the chasu were good (the duck was okay...i felt like it got lost from the flavors of the broth)\n\nAfter halfway in, the saltiness and the heaviness didnt leave, although i can deal with the salty food...this may be a bit too much for most people.  The good thing about this ramen is that it stays hot through the whole time i was eating it.  Kudos\n\nI also tried the spicy lamb broth...and THAT SH*T was way too salty...even saltier than mine...so salty that my person was even tempted to ask for hot water to dilute down the flavor.  It wasnt bad though but it was just way too salty.", "author": "Laurie W."}

As a group, we decided to go check it out. We came with a group of seven and we decided to come early at 4:30pm before door was open. We took Uber there and as soon as we got out of the car, to our surprise, the line was already halfway long! When the door was finally opened at exactly 5:00pm sharp, the first wave of people in the line came in to be seated and unfortunately, we had to wait for our turn. Keep in mind that we have seven people in our group. Now the challenge was that my girlfriend and I needed to go back to LA and we only had an hour to eat as we also needed to Uber to the Oakland airport, which was cutting it very close. We decided to risk it and waited for our turn as we broke the group into two and five instead of seven people in a group. \n\nAs soon as a couple was leaving, my girlfriend and I was seated. It was kind of awkward at first because the seating distance between me and my neighbors between me were too close. However, we came there to eat and that's what we wanted to focus on, the food! As soon as we finished ordering, the workers there were kind enough to wait for the five people that were sitting around us to finish eating altogether and offered them seats to my brothers and friends! So we ended up sitting together as a group and I was very grateful! \n\nPhew that was a long backstory, but it was necessary to be told because I wanted to focus on how delicious these ramen were although we were in a rush! My girlfriend and I ordered Tan Tan Ramen and Tori Paitan Ramen. When i first tried the Tan Tan Ramen, which was a vegetarian ramen, I was in shocked on how delicious that soup was! In addition, the texture of the noodles were just right. Not too raw, and not to cooked either. It was just right! Tan Tan Ramen didn't even taste like vegetables, I felt like I've eaten some type of meat there. I believe that's because this ramen was genuinely made for vegetarian as if they were eating meat! Which was brilliant! As for Tor Paitan Ramen, it was also yummy! the meat was great and the vegetables and fried onions made the taste even better! We finished them ramen in just 25 min, paid, said goodbye to everyone, and left! Even in the Uber's car, we kept on reminiscing on how great those ramens were.", "author": "Aldo H."}

(3 pieces) $5\n\nThis was good; a nice, simple appetizer. the oysters aren't large, and seems like something that came out of a can, frankly, but still, I liked it and would order it again. It just works.\n\n++ Tori Paitan Ramen (Double Chashu) $18\n(Rich and Creamy Chicken Soup, Pork Chashu, Duck Chashu, Menma, Kale, Burdock, Katsuobushi Sauce)\n\nAhhh... I can't eat this. It sounds good, smells good, looks good as food porn, but it is SO RICH. It's just short of being a gravy. I ordered this on my first visit and made a mental note not to order it again. On my second visit, I didn't order it, but when I smelled it and saw it, I doubted my decision. Then I had a sip of the soup and I was like nope. The noodles are really chewy, and the soup flavor is good, but after the first few bites it already feels like too much. \n\n\n++ Organic Shoyu Ramen (Double Chashu) $16\n(Clear Organic Chicken and Pork Soup, Shoyu Dare, Pork Chashu, Duck Chashu, Kale, Kale Sprouts,Chives, Menma, Nori)\n\nThe duck was okay; chashu was better but it was nice to have another meat choice in the ramen. I think it was hard to notice the chashu in the tori paitan, due to the decadence of the soup, but in the shoyu, the chashu is a fatty standout. probably the best chashu in a ramen that i've had. the noodles in the shoyu are good, but different - thinner and lighter than it's tori paitan counterpart. it paired well w/ the shoyu broth. The broth itself tasted like bonito more than shoyu. \n\n\nI would not come back for these two ramen dishes, but I still want to come back to try the other options. As for the wait, we waited about 30 minutes the first time, and maybe 20 minutes the second time. Not bad at all. Once you're in, though, the seats and ambiance are not intended to have patrons stay and shoot the shit.

I ordered the  Maccha Tori Paitan Ramen and my boyfriend ordered the Organic Shoyu Ramen. If you love matcha, I definitely recommend trying their Maccha ramen. I was expecting the Maccha ramen to only have a light coat of matcha powder on it, but I was wrong! There was so much matcha that it was also covering the rim on the bowl! The broth was thick, creamy and silky, and the noodles and chashu were cooked perfectly. I'd personally say that this is one of the best ramen I've ever had and I'll definitely be coming back for more!

My only complaint is the space is cramped and on the louder side, making it slightly difficult to have a conversation. \n\nI was able to try the oysters in shoyu dare oil, tori paitan,  and shio ramen. The oysters were tasty, but nothing too special. The tori paitan had a richer and thicker broth than any other ramen I've eaten. The new consistency was initially overwhelming, but I loved the flavor and finished more of it than I should have by the end of the meal. The shio was much lighter and more similar to ramen broth you can get at other Japanese restaurants.

It wasn't too bad of a wait for a Sunday night at 7pm, but I was a bit confused that they didn't seat us when there were multiple seats opened and ready. It makes me believe that they seat people in waves, which is fine. \n\nI ordered the Shoyu ramen and oysters in dare oil, while my boyfriend ordered the Tori Paitan ramen and the enoki fries. The reason I rate this restaurant a 2/5 is because both the oysters and the Shoyu ramen were INCREDIBLY salty and UNEDIBLE. Furthermore, the Shoyu broth, made from chicken and pork broth, tasted so strongly of just fish - bonito flakes to be exact. I had to ask them for a bowl of broth to mix in to reduce the saltiness, but even that was not enough to counteract the saltiness. I've never had any ramen this salty before, which is a shame. I feel like they need to constantly check the flavor of their broth, which I'm sure became more concentrated due to evaporation. Furthermore, their Shoyu ramen has strange noodles that were slightly soft and overcooked. I much prefer the thicker, al dente cooked noodles that my boyfriend had in his Tori Paitan noodles.Also, duck chashu is just not that great. This is quite a shame because I couldn't enjoy the meal - which is already quite expensive and includes a 15% service charge.\n\nThe Tori Paitan was really thick which I don't enjoy much, but the broth tasted fine.

As such, what better way to get back into than start with the absolutely most mindblowing culinary experience I've had locally in years? That's right, this humble little ramen shop in the Tenderloin was exactly that.\n\nI'd been hearing about this shop for a while since it opened to great fanfare and long lines. Many of my friends went on at least a weekly basis. Since I don't live in SF, it's never been very convenient for me to go there. One time I was in SF for a Johnnie Walker event, and my friends and I thought it would be an awesome idea to check out Mensho afterwards. It was around 8:30 or 9 pm and we were starving and needed something to soak up the alcohol. We got to Mensho, but the line was ridiculously long, and starving stomachs couldn't wait. Mensho would have to wait for another day.\n\nFast forward a few months, and finally, I heard lines were starting to become more manageable. I was in SF to meet a few visitors from the mid-West, and my friends and I suggested that we check out Mensho. Again, it was around 8:30 pm. We walked over from Union Square, and there was a line, but it looked bearable. We had 6 people. Maybe waited 20 min in line, not bad at all given how small the shop is and how big our group was. We perused the menu during our wait.\n\nOnce we were seated, we were ready to order. I ordered the Tori Paitan.\n\nWhen it came, I dipped into the broth and my mind was blown. I hadn't had broth like this in a long time, and it's been a long time since I last went to Ramen Dojo, so I can't really compare except that I recall having a similar reaction. I don't even know how to describe the rich creamy flavor (but not disgustingly fatty like Orenchi), except that perhaps this is what they invented the word \"umami\" for.\n\nThe hype was not blown out of proportion. It really is as amazing as everyone hyped it up to me. Normally, I try to temper hype and go somewhere with low expectations for fear of ruining the experience. I didn't really try to come here with low expectations. No, I came with high expectations, and the culinary experience exceeded my expectations.

At 6pm on a Wed we only had to wait about 20 minutes for a table for 4 and an additional 10 minutes for the food to arrive after we ordered while waiting in line. \n\nMost of us ordered the Tori Paitan ($16 rich and creamy chicken soup, pork chashu, duck chashu, menma, kale, burdock, katsuobushi sauce) with one lone Organic Shoyu ($14 clear organic chicken and pork Soup, shoyu dare, pork chashu, duck chashu, kale, kale sprouts, chives, menma, nori).\n\nThe Tori Paitan was rich and creamy as described. The ramen came out piping hot so I was unable to really slurp and go as intended. The noodles were slightly thicker but not thick, and nice and chewy. The broth was a little too rich to drink on it's own but really good with noodles and meat and bits. \n\nI didn't try the Shoyu but the friend who ordered it and his date tried both and declared the Tori Paitan much better.\n\nNot sure I would wait an hour but would make an effort to get in for an early dinner.", "author": "Jean K."}

They are masters of their craft. \n\nIt takes a lot of talent to get such a clear, well balanced broth like this. The broth was perfect. In fact, it was dreamy. Check out all the glass filtering utensils that they use to clear the broth. I love how much care and precision Japanese have when cooking.  \n\nI went for the Shiro Ramen. It had beautiful flat soba style noodles and very tender slices of pork. So tender, they kept shape in the bowl, but easily fell apart when picking it up to eat with chopsticks. How do they keep this shape when slicing it for the soup? \n\nThe restaurant itself is not that big. Only four groups of tables that sit around six people. So I would suggest that this restaurant suits no more than four people in a group. The service is quick, polite and attentive.

I mean seriously?? Does she want my mom and youngest daughter to wait outside in the rain because we didn't order them separate bowl of ramen???! \n\nI was shocked and felt humiliated because people that seating really close to our table heard all what she said to us, it felt like we could not afford to pay for five bowls and we should not eat out if we are just sharing it to the rest of our family. The fact that my youngest daughter only eat tiny amount of food and my mom is also the same, why would I waste 2 bowls of ramen that we can't even take home if we can't finish it?!! Yes, they don't have a to go container so how would they expect us to order more food if it will just end up into waste. \n\nThe hype for getting a good ramen is just not right.

The place does its noodles a little undercooked(the way most ramen shops offer when the shop doesn't let you choose your style) so it'll be a little hard in the middle. My gf likes the noodles like this. The soup, though strange, had a great taste, didn't leave a dirty taste in your mouth, and definitely high quality.

My friends recommended that the best way to not have to wait an hour to eat ramen was to get there 30 minutes before the restaurant opened. The restaurant opens at 5pm and my friends and I arrived at 4:30pm on a Saturday. There was already a line, but we were still in the first group of people to be served.\n\nThe restaurant isn't huge. There are three tables: one long table that seats ~15 and two other tables that seat ~6 each. Though on the smaller side, the place didn't feel cramped, I felt that they used the space efficiently.\n\nThe menu wasn't extensive and didn't need to be for a ramen shop. I mean, what else are you going to get at a ramen shop? (I actually don't think there were any other entrees besides ramen.) We started with the oyster appetizer and the bamboo shoots. The oysters were very different from what I expected oysters, salty and firm. I really enjoyed them. The bamboo shoots were just bamboo shoots, nothing too special. For ramen, I ended up ordering the Tori Paitan with double chashu (double meat), which is their signature ramen. The soup base was.... amazing... It's a chicken based soup broth, which isn't typical. The broth was super rich and on the thicker side of broths I've had. The meat was sliced nice and thin, and the noodles were cooked to perfection. Everything came together so perfectly. It was like a miniature orchestra in my mouth. One of those meal experiences you wish would never end.\n\nDefinitely worth the 30 minute wait, even an hour+ wait.

Sets you back $18.\n\nThe chashu is so fatty and well-selected that it literally falls apart when your chopstick touches it. I could almost drink it with the creamy broth. And that broth is just so creamy and thick like tsukemen broth but not nearly as salty. It is excellent. \n\nThe duck chashu is a nice addition since the texture is different than the pork. This might also be the first ramen I've ever had with Kale-- I didn't not like it. Menma (bamboo shoots) Katsuobushi (fermented fish flakes) are all thrown in there but noodles and the chashu are the stars of this bowl.\n\nThe oyster appetizers are just okay-- I could do without. To me, it tastes like jarred oysters soaked in soy sauce. The line is a little off putting but like all good things in Japan, there is a line. The line doesn't move as fast as you'd imagine since waiting for the bowl of ramen after ordering isn't as fast as you'd think. It is well worth it though and if you're ever a single diner, they usually call out for single seat availability which allows solo patrons to cut the line.

I finally gathered up the courage one Wednesday evening to brave the line and get what's considered to be the best ramen in SF! We arrived around 7:30 (peak dinner time) and with our party of 2 we waited in line for about 45 mins; not too bad considering I've heard of people having to wait for 2+ hours. \n\nWe tried the vegan ramen and it was so different than any other ramen I've tried. The broth was not clear; instead, it was a cloudy brown color with a thick texture. The description said it had 9 different nuts in it so that made the broth more crunchy than smooth. I really liked that the ramen had edamame and bamboo shoots as toppings! The spice level was also perfect for me (not too bland and not too spicy), it had just the right amount of kick. \n\nThey try to get you in and out of there as fast as possible, probably because they always have a line outside. One odd thing was that they didn't have to-go boxes to take your leftover ramen home (I've never heard of that before). All in all, the ramen was very good and I would come back here again!

Didn't wait long (~15mins) at 7:15pm on a weeknight before getting seated at one of their 4 large communal tables.  It was a girls night out but the tables were wide enough to carry on a semi-private conversation without worrying that our neighbors were encroaching.  The service was adequate but rushed.  The point is to clear as many patrons as possible in the most efficient way.  I get it.  Don't linger.\n\nWe both opted for the Tori Paitan.  This is THE ramen to start with.  I've been to Japan twice and I've just never had anything like it.  Smooth. Creamy.  Oh so good.  Sure, my picture makes the ramen appear fatty, rich and dense but I didn't feel like a heavy greaseball afterwards.  The portion is just right and the perfectly marbled pieces of chashu pork and DUCK were absolute heaven in my mouth.  Meltingly tender.\n\nThe soup base does have a somewhat funky fishy aftertaste.  If that's not your thing, get the vegan ramen which I may try on my future visit.  It contains 7 types of nuts and was mentioned in several Yelp reviews that I read while waiting in line.\n\nOh, in case you're wondering, there's no need to \"add\" any of the standard ramen toppings - like egg, corn, mushrooms.  You won't miss it.  In fact, it's not even offered.  The broth is rich and flavorful on its own.  Restraint is key.  If you want standard ramen with all the usual fixins' go elsewhere.

They didnt let people in until 5:10 or so and I was getting cranky waiting to enter cuz I hungers. I was one of the first 6 so we ordered first but our food took like 20-25 minutes. The people who actually got their food first were the ones you got the limited supply dipping noodles. They took those orders while we waited outside in line since it takes 15 minutes to prep. One by one, people got those dipping dishes and the rest who ordered broth ramen had to wait in agony. Le sigh. By the time I finished my bowl, the next group of 6 started to slowly get their food. Cant imagine how long the other tables had to wait for their food. \n\nI got the Tori paiten ramen, the one everyone gets cuz there is pork and duck. for $2 more I got double meat.

Due to the lack of space, all of the dining tables are communal and you'll often find yourself next to a new face. The idea might scream claustrophobia but MT managed to make it pleasant; and honestly, the clean lines and light wood work of the interior is really easy on the eyes. \n\nMy friend warned me about the line prior to coming so we made sure to arrive a half hour before opening. At 4:30 pm there was already five people ahead of us and we all stared at the window in hunger. \n\nOnce inside, we quickly ordered the Tori Paitan (the hype on this dish is unreal) and the first bite had my taste buds singing. \n\nThe broth had depth, was extremely creamy and thick.

The noodles were cooked really well and had a nice chewy texture. \n\nMy friends and I didn't speak throughout the entire meal.

I was ok with that, but if you're not a fan of heavy bonito flavor, I'd skip on the shio. The noodles were the crumply kind, but they weren't al dente but rather soft instead. Toppings consisted of kale (how fitting...of SF?), nori, bamboo, green onions and one piece of chashu.

We got seated almost immediately. Even though I was happy we didn't have to wait, I was slightly annoyed because the waitress still rushed us. Not even 30 seconds after we sat down with our menus, the waitress asked us what we wanted to order. I told her that I was still looking at the menu, and she seemed impatient/annoyed. She came back 1 minute later to see if I was ready ... I ordered the Tori Paitan, since there's not many items on the menu anyways.\n\nThe food came out very quickly. The servings are a pretty decent size, but I still don't think it's worth $16. I really liked the noodles because they were thick and the texture was very good (not too soft, I prefer my noodles to be on the hard side). The broth was also the creamiest, richest, most flavorful broth I've ever tasted. I enjoyed the taste initially, but it was a bit overwhelming to have so much of it. Even their motto on the wall says, \"indispensable to Mensho ramen is the wealth of glutamic acid...\" so I'm not surprised the broth would be so flavorful. \n\nAlso, the place is very small. It's a communal dining space, so you'll be sitting at a long bar table alongside many others. I went with one other person so it wasn't a problem at all, but I wouldn't recommend trying to go here with a large group of people. \n\nOverall, try this place if you like really flavorful, rich ramen.

Honestly, for a $16 bowl of ramen, you'd expect more. It was very mediocre. I've had way better ramen for much less. \n\nEverything about this place kinda of turned me off. The whole community seating thing takes away from the dining experience IMO. I understand the place being small and all but it was so crammed. The woman sitting next to me kept smacking my face with her ponytail every time she turned her head. That's how crammed it was. And by having people so close, I can barely hear the person in front of me speak and can hear everyone's conversation next to me. \n\nThe service was beyond terrible. The group that came 15 minutes after us received their food before us and the other group beside us who ordered at the same time, finished eating before our food even came out. Like what the hell is up with that? The woman who was probably the manager/owner was pretty rude and impatient. She sat a group down next to us and immediately demanded their order. I know your menu is like basic and all but damn give them a few minutes to decide. She also told them that they can't share a bowl. I don't understand what the big deal about sharing is. Maybe they can't finish an entire bowl by themselves. Although, I don't really see how someone can't finish a bowl as their bowls are narrow at the bottom and portions are extremely small. \n\nTo be honest, this is probably the worse bowl of ramen I've ever had. It was beyond oily and too salty for my taste. I had to ask for some chili oil to make the flavor a little more interesting and because I enjoy eating everything spicy. The ramen was already hella oily before the chili oil but trust me, it made the ramen much more eatable. I wouldn't drink the soup unless you want to drink oil. \n\nI honestly don't understand what all the hype is about. The place is too damn small, service was terrible, way too expensive, and food was basic. Save yourself the wait in line and eat elsewhere. For a few dollars more, you can have all-you-can-eat hotpot or korean bbq. I haven't tried many ramen places in SF but if you want really good ramen, check out Hayward or Sacramento.

Street parking can be tough, but you can park in an expensive garage a few blocks away, or take the bus. \n\nThey list out some menu items on the wall, but they're not available yet. They currently offer a limited menu with just 4 ramen options. I had the Tori Paitan Ramen. It was delicious. The broth was thick, creamy, very rich and flavorful, but had a slight grittiness. The noodles were chewy and cooked to perfection. Toppings were unique, which I really liked. I had pork chasu and duck, which were both very tender. Since coming back from Japan, a bunch of ramen shops seem a bit mediocre to me. So I'm really glad to say that this was legit.", "author": "Katherine C."}

Not awful considering what I've heard about this place, and the fact that the line was moving made it less of a terrible experience. Still, the wait and all of the hype surrounding Mensho definitely built up expectations.\n\nI can't say that the ramen completely met those expectations. I got the Tori Peitan, because it seems to be the specialty and the obvious choice for a first meal there. It was definitely a unique flavor but overwhelmingly rich (even for me, and I thought I only liked super rich ramen). The duck chashu was pretty incredible, but there wasn't enough of it. I see why people buy the upgrade. The noodles were very thick and cooked to perfection - probably the best component of the ramen. Overall I liked my bowl and finished it all, but it wasn't the best I've had or even the best I've had in SF. \n\nWe also shares the oyster appetizer which was small but tasty and interesting.\n\nI like the layout of the place, the communal tables, and the general ambiance. While the ramen wasn't the best ever, it was a fun experience.", "author": "Sara M."}

That's a lot coming from someone who loves thick, deep flavored ramen.\n\nThe vegan ramen was my favorite. It had a peanut-satay spicy flavor. It is a little less thick than the tori paitan. It's hard to believe this ramen is vegan, it's so good.\n\nWith that being said, I can still only rate this 3*. The price is a little outrageous, and the lines are way too long. While the ramen was good, I would never wait more than 20mi s for this place. If this ramen is your jam, try Izakaya Goku in the Mission - slightly less thick ramen broth but equal flavor, cheaper,much shorter wait.\n\nI did appreciate how you can order more broth or noodles here.

I tried the spicy lamb ramen, and it was light on the spiciness, packed with meaty, cumin lamb flavor. I'd recommend it for someone who loves lamb, especially grilled cumin lamb skewers. \n\nI love drinking ramen broth. Mensho's soup is deep and rich, filled with those free amino acids that are advertised on their walls. Every bite of ramen noodles is packed with flavor and meaty richness but the trade off is that the broth is a little too rich to drink out of the bowl after finishing all the noodles and toppings.\n\nThe chasu was melt in your mouth deliciousness. It wound be wrong to write a review about ramen and not mention the quality of the soft boiled egg. Their egg yolk was soft and perfect and somehow it's been cooked such that the white has been infused with their broth's flavor.\n\nWait: I showed up at 8:30pm on a Thursday and waited 30 minutes.", "author": "Nancy W."}

The spot i was in, wasnt too shabby and i got in within the first round. As each 10 min pass by the line doubles up, by 430pm. To 445 pm you basically ran out of luck and gotta wait until the second round. \n\nWhen i sat down i ordered right away due to not want to wait for a while. I ordered the tori with double chashu, i requested to add an egg but they couldnt do it. \n\nTori with double chashu ramen - this was served in about 10 to 15 mins of waiting. The bowl looked big and was beautifully presented. Of course i had to photo bless it before chowing down. The broth was really thick and you can totally see a layer of chicken fat since it was made with chicken. The broth was very rich in flavor with chicken flavor. Its kind of cloudy as well, it paired well with the fresh do it yourself ground your own black pepper. \n\nI tried sprinkling different spices that was offered on. The table as condiments, it was great and gave me a zing here and there. The chashu is very rich and strong on the first bite. As well the chashu is like bone fall off texture where it was just melt when you try to pick it up with your chopstick. The other 2 slices of duck is tender and a bit chewy. I do like the duck better than the pork. \n\nOne of my favorite veggies was the kale, and i couldnt believe how good kale is inside the ramen soup. It also had bamboo shoots, and bits of cabbage as well. \n\nPrice is steep for 18 dollar a bowl with 2 pc of pork, 2 pieces of duck, and bamboo shoots, kale, and bits of cabbage. The portion is like just right wont be stuffed but wont leave you too hungry. \n\nOverall i am glad i waited 45 mins before open time to avoid the long crowd and man if you dont have time to wait, i just say go elsewhere. If you do have the time try it once and you can say you been here and cross it off your bucketlist. So the question is will i do it again? Maybe not, i wasnt impressed with it, and it is different from what i had in tokyo japan. But why 4 stars? Its great and one of the better ones i have had in SF, until i can find better.

The wait was about an hour for 3 people around 6:30PM on a chilly March night, so you might want to have a snack before dinner.\nThere is no take out here, so dont even think about it.\n\nThe setting is quite small, but clean. Its what comes to mind when I think of a contemporary ramen shop. There are high top stools and bench tables with boxes underneath that you can put your stuff in (I was wondering why the random boxes were there).  You will share a table and sit closely with whoever youre next to, be it a random person or not.  This allows you to eavesdrop easily so you can sit there and silently judge while eating your ramen.  The staff is super friendly and once youre inside, service is fast.\n\nI got recommended the Tori Paitan, which is their rich & creamy chicken soup.  I enjoyed all of the meats included, especially the chashu.  I read the ingredients but had no idea that \"menma\" was bamboo.  Now I dont necessarily hate bamboo, I'd just rather not eat it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-17", "description": "First of all, the line for this place is insane. You want a tip on when to come? Probably even at weird times, the line is better but it's still long. We came on a Thursday night around 9:15p. Maybe it was because of the NBA finals, with a game that just recently ended and people still at the bar, or maybe it was just because we caught the lull in between the dinner rush and the late dinner crowd. We ended up waiting for about 20 minutes. I would also recommend you come in a smaller group of like 2 people. You are likely to get seated faster with a small party because the shop is very small. Bigger parties just have to wait for more tables to open up. \n\nOk, on to the ramen. You want to know if it's worth the wait? I don't think any food is really worth a two-hour wait, so that's where I'm coming from. But it is very good ramen. We got three bowls to share between the two of us so that we could try more things.  My friend who had been there before said that her favorite is vegan tantanmen, and we are both partial to spicy ramen. However, they ran out by the time we got there. At least that's what our server said - but I think she must have gotten false information from the kitchen.  The dude next to us who came after got a bowl, which made us very sad. Note that if you get more food than you can eat, they do NOT do to-go orders. Meaning they won't give you a to-go box. I'm not sure I like this policy. You shouldn't make delicious food and then not let people bring it home with them to enjoy if they can't finish it all. I will also say that I still like Ramen Dojo better than this place because I'm partial to spicy broth and they didn't have the spicy one when we were here. \n\nSo here are the bowls of ramen we tried: \n\n(1) Tori Paitan: I think this is their specialty. I don't really like chicken broth ramen, but this place has the best chicken ramen I've ever had. The broth is frothy and creamy and satisfying. Also the noodles here are some of the best ramen noodles I've ever had. They're thicker than normal and really yummy. Still, I love spicy ramen and this was delicious but a little too bland for me. The toppings are good too - duck chashu and pork chashu are both yummy. \n\n(2) Shoyu: If you like shoyu ramen, this is probably the best one I've ever had. If you like lighter broths this is the one for you. I'm not as big a fan of lighter broths, but I could tell this ramen was done really well. The noodles are really good in this one too, still chewy but a little thinner than the ones that come in the tori paitan. \n\n(3) Spicy Mazesoba: Originally, we were going to get the vegan tantanmen as our third bowl but they ran out. Then we wanted to get the tsukemen, but they said they run out at 7p. So we decided on the spicy mazesoba. I have never had this before, so I had no idea what it is. Basically, it's like noodles with sauce but no soup. It comes in a bowl (see attached pic) with an egg yolk and various toppings. Note that the spicy one also comes with a side of what I think are habanero peppers, but not super sure. We thought these were carrots and put the entire thing in - it was wayyyyy too spicy this way - like wasabi style spicy. Do not do what we did! I think this noodle dish would have been really yummy to try and share if we didn't accidentally make it so darn spicy, it came with thick and chewy delicious noodles. Good alternative to the soup ramens, and interesting to try if you come with a group. \n\nAll in all, I'd give this place five stars for the food. But docking it one star because of the to-go policy and because they didn't explain how to eat the mazesoba to us. It's not really intuitive! Just don't go in expecting great service either because it's a little too crowded and busy to give great service. \n\nI will definitely be back to try to get my hands on bowls of tsukemen and the vegan tantanmen!", "author": "Lin Z."}

We both ordered the ramen with the creamy duck broth, which we thought was the \"signature dish.\" It was great, the soup definitely had a creamy consistency, which is unlike any other type of ramen broth I've had. A good comparison I can think of would be clam chowder. Yup, it's thick and some might say it's hard to drink, but I'm a drinker of stews and chowders so I can live with it. I had two slices of duck which were cooked medium-rare, the center of the slices were pinkish which made the meal really interesting. I also had a slice of way overcooked char-siu which was tough and not fatty enough for my liking. BUT, CAN WE PLEASE TALK ABOUT THE TEXTURE OF THESE NOODLES? They are so amazing and chewy and just a gift to the glutenous girl in me--they absorb the flavors of the broth really well and the texture is really cool. Overall this was delicious but without any additions, with gratuity and Uncle Sam's portion, the total come out to a little over $20.

Honestly, it seems like the size of a boba, ice cream, or froyo place... It's so small, you don't even get your own table. You sit very closely next to strangers on the same table, unless you get one of the four seats at the bar. It was a little...too cozy for my liking. Definitely not a place to spill juicy secrets with a friend if you don't want your table neighbors potentially listening in also. I'm quite a small person but I still would've preferred to have more space. I sat at the table closest to the bar and I kept getting bumped into by people walking toward or serving the people at the bar. Also, you're sitting on bar stools and have to put your coats and bags in baskets underneath the tall table. I like having my stuff a little closer to me but oh well. They also played their music really loudly so it was a little harder to have a conversation - and it was already hard because people were talking right next to us.\n\nAlright, onto the food.

Got the Tori Paittan (spelling? first item on the menu) $16. You can get double cha-siu for $18 a bowl. The meat was so tender it literally melted in your mouth. The noodles were comparable to other good ramen places I've had, definitely not the best but pretty solid.

Come here if you don't mind the long wait.\n\nRead on if you dare:\n\nI stood in line for 2.5 hours for this. Wow. I can't believe I did that LOL. Thankfully my friend and I were just chatting and catching up the whole time, so it really didn't feel like that long -- we didn't realize we had been in line for that long until we got in and looked at the time actually LOL. We got in line around 4:30 PM on Sunday evening and it was already pretty long. It started raining a bit while we were in line and by the time we were inside, it was POURING. But the line was just as long at 8 PM as it was at 4:30.\n\n+ DECOR/AMBIANCE\nThe decor is very interesting and trendy. It's a hip, modern spin on a Japanese restaurant -- tons of writing on the walls, which are very fun to read! It explains what ramen is, what umami is, etc. There's a coat rack towards the front. It's very cozy and homey feeling. The restaurant itself is INSANELY small. There's three longish communal tables, and the restaurant can probably seat about 25-30 people. You will be in close quarters with everyone sitting around you. However, it's easy to ignore the conversations next to you because it is CRAZY LOUD. It was so hard to hear anything my friend said and he was sitting right across from me. It was even harder to hear/comprehend the waitresses since they all seemed to talk very quietly and softly. They play some loud pop music in the back and with the constant yelling from people trying to hear each other, I definitely wouldn't describe it as a calming atmosphere LOL. Probably not good for a date. Good for friends and small groups. \n\n+ SERVICE\nWell aside from the insanely long line, our waitresses were very attentive. There were a lot of them too. They were all girls that spoke very quietly so it made it hard to hear/understand what they were saying. I wanted to order the Tori Paitan with double cha siu but I guess our waitress was confused as to how I could eat so much because she tried to clarify the difference between the regular and the double and I kept saying I wanted the double but she was very confused. I eventually was just like yes I want the regular DOUBLE cha siu not DOUBLE DOUBLE, but the $18 one. I ended up with the normal Tori Paitain, $16 one not the $18. Sad. But oh well. They also didn't seem to know the items on the menu that well. The group next to us would ask which ramen was which once she brought it out to the table, and she'd have to run back and ask. I ordered the Tori Paitan and my friend ordered the Shoyu, and they swapped it accidentally. This made me very sad. LOL. But I will say they were very nice and apologetic about it. They randomly gave us green tea LOL. We didn't ask for it but they were just like HERE TAKE THIS TEA, so we did and we were very grateful LOL. \n\n+ THE RAMEN\nSO FREAKING GOOD. YUM. As I said, I had the Tori Paitan. It was a great portion size. They did not skimp on the noodles, which I appreciated. Sadly I did not get to eat the ramen how I usually do since they gave my friend my ramen at first and when we realized, it was already all stirred up. I like to leave it as is and eat all the vegetables first, and then eat the noodles and meat without like...disturbing the presentation of any of it LOL if that makes sense. I'm weird I know. I just like my food to look nice while I eat it. I didn't get the double cha siu like I wanted but the meat was very delicious and flavorful. Perfectly cooked, and just melted in your mouth. The vegetables were also SO GOOD. Strangely, to me it tasted very meaty. And it seemed to melt in your mouth also. The Tori Paitain comes with a thicker noodle than the Shoyu, which I loved since I'm all for the fat noodles. The broth was VERY thick, and sort of gritty...not in a bad way. It was creamy and very flavorful. It's not for the faint of heart. I tried some of the Shoyu broth, and it's noticeably lighter. Very salty. I definitely preferred the Tori Paitan more. \n\nOverall, delicious ramen. VERY LONG WAIT. Maybe the wait will die down in a few months. And by then, hopefully the service will be better. I think they just needed to work on speaking more clearly, and knowing the orders better. Obviously this place just opened recently, so I'll let the slightly less than satisfactory service slide for now. The waitresses were all very nice and the complimentary tea was a nice gesture. If you aren't dedicated to the foodie life, wait a few months because the line is insane. If you are dedicated and willing to wait for hours in line, GO FOR IT. TRY THIS PLACE.

Ours was also long but timed well on a Sunday by getting their at 3:50 and were seated within minutes of their 5pm opening. \n\nSo, again: Lines = Long. You have been warned. And hopefully you'll be lucky like us and won't be behind an individual who holds spots for large parties who, as witnessed and reported in other reviews, show up minutes before opening. \n\nWas Mensho worth it? For our trio, absolutely. Again, partly due to luck and good timing. But mostly, for the ramen. We each opted for the Tori Paitan, with a double chashu order for the gents. While it's doubtful any new opinions can be offered, it was easily one of the best bowls of ramen I've experienced. The broth, very thick -- even moreso than most tonkotsu, and coaxed mostly from chicken vs. pork bone, yielding softer but more nuanced flavor than its porcine counterpart. Its texture: were I the photo editor of a dictionary, this is what I'd use for the word \"mouthfeel.\" https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mensho-tokyo-san-francisco-2?select=qqf4OrsRY0VRa3VVJ7fV6Q The noodles -- the best I've had, a bit thicker and more full-bodied than Oakland's Ramen Shop. The toppings, from the dash of chives to the menma, each adding to what makes eating a great bowl of ramen a true experience.  And last but no means least, both chashu, especially the duck, beautifully subtle in its individuality and synergy. \n\nPortions larger than Ramen Shop too. Speaking of R.S., they've gotta be a little worried about the competition, particularly since they practically stopped serving tonkotsu broth ... but that's another story. \n\nWe also had the oysters, which weren't a personal fave, but I'm not a fan of fishy fish. If you are, might be worth your indulgence. \n\nBeyond the food, the interior is clean and lovely and fun. And, despite their efficiency, all the staff, particularly the host and our waitress, demonstrated uncommon courtesy and conviviality. They deserve big props for their friendliness and customer service. \n\nNext visit, I'm going for the vegan, with the option of chashu toppings. It's a very accommodating place.

The broth was SO creamy, rich, and something I wasn't normally used to. It was surprisingly not salty at all yet VERY flavorful. The noodles were cooked perfectly, nice and thick.

Meanwhile, the Peninsula hosts the remarkable Ramen Dojo/Parlor duo, while in the South Bay, solid ramen establishments seem to popup every year.  With Mensho Tokyo, SF can finally compete with all the other titans in the Bay Area.  And they're bringing more than just ramen--their mazesoba is delicious too!\n\nMy first impression of their tori paitan ramen was the flawless execution of its individual components.  The noodles were a perfect al dente with some satisfying give to them on every bite; the pork chashu melted away with just right amount of fat and pork flavor; the chicken broth--very creamy and rich, maybe overpoweringly so, but still complex and enjoyable enough to have with every slurp; and the duck chashu...just wow...it's DUCK chashu god dammit, something to die for.  \n\nThe whole bowl of ramen, with all of these components, was quite heavy, and might not be for everyone--but if extreme savoriness is your jam, then this might just be the best ramen in the Bay Area for you.\n\nAlso of interest is their mazesoba!  It's apparently a recent food trend in Japan, so Mensho Tokyo might currently be one of the only places to offer this dish in the United States.  Regardless, it's absolutely delicious and totally worth trying.  It's essentially a dry bowl of noodles (not quite soba though, a bit thicker and similar in consistency to their ramen) with some vegetable (green onions, chives, watercress, seaweed, garlic, etc.) and meat toppings (ground pork)--somewhat of a cross between bibimbap (it has the raw egg too) and zha jiang mian.  \n\nMixing it all together is when the magic happens.  Every bite of noodles was accompanied with a saucy mixture of meat, fragant herbs, and crunch from the vegetables.  Why hasn't anyone thought about doing this before?  It's worth mentioning that we got the extra spicy version, and it certainly did pack quite a kick!\n\nThe wait on a random Tuesday night was about 2 hours, and when we finished eating at 9ish, the line was still just as long!

The duck was definitely the highlight of meal. The pork was on the salty side. Noodles were chewy and el dente just the way I like it. Broth was creamy but so loaded with chicken fat that it was deemed too unhealthy and rich to be drinkable by my friends...but I did it anyways! \n\nThe organic shoyu ramen was too salty with strong a undercurrent of bonito and seaweed.

Some people might not like that, but I didn't mind; made the in-and-out process that much easier.\n\nI got the vegan ramen which is cooked in 7 different nuts and it was DELICIOUS! I'm not a vegan, but it was so rich and flavorful that you wouldn't even notice there weren't any meat. The noodle was chewy and fresh. Yum yum.\n\nSide note: I actually came back a couple of hours later on the same night, but the line by then was way out the door.\n\nSecond side note: It's 2 blocks down fro Katana-ya, same price point, but 100x better so GO TO THIS ONE!", "author": "Julia N."}

The noodles have a little bite to them which I love. And the duck and pork chashu just melts in your mouth. It's like a dream. \n\nMe and my boyfriend always come around 10:30-11:00 to avoid the long line. Even then it's still about a 20 to 30 minute wait which I really don't mind because the food and service is sooo worth it. They always have a door man at the front who happily answers any questions you may have about the menu and fills you in on what the owner has planned for for the restaurant. \n\nI recommend coming in small groups or even by yourself because there is no way a large party can sit together without waiting for hours and hours. They only have Japanese style communal tables so you're always going to be sitting with strangers. I actually enjoy that because every time we go we get seated next to some really fun people :) \n\n5 stars for the whole experience.", "author": "Christine L."}

If you like your noodles and broth thicc, then you MUST endure the wait and try it here.\nThe first thing I noticed was the lack of an egg. I know, I too felt cheated.. I usually always finish my bowls of ramen, but the ones here are particularly rich and creamy that I couldn't bring myself to eat the last spoonfuls. The broth definitely didn't need the added thickness of the traditional egg after all.\n\nThe restaurant is tiny with communal tables so wait times can be overwhelming. But if you want to try something a little more unique try the toripaitan ramen!\n\nOverall my boyfriend and I agreed this is some of the best ramen we've had, and I've been to Japan!", "author": "Jacqueline N."}

I had my friend wait while I drove around for 15 minutes looking for parking. Line went pretty quickly for how long it was. I may not have picked the right ramen, because I was extremely underwhelmed when it came out. The menu's print was so tiny I kind of said eff it and picked one that seemed popular. It was the double charsu ramen that was $18. The broth was too salty for me, and I love salt. The noodles looked fresh but were a little too soft for my preference. Maybe it's being picky, but the spoons they give you to eat with were ridiculously huge and hard to use to eat. There's no eggs, nothing too special. Didn't really even remind me of ramen - if it's as authentic as people say it is to Japanese ramen, maybe I shouldn't visit Japan. \n\nThe place is TINY. Only 2 long tables really that you share and a tiny little bar where people can sit as well. Pretty sure the single stalled restroom is bigger than the restaurant (exaggerating of course but proportionally to how many people, it's pretty true). \n\nId rather drive out of the city to my favorite ramen spot.", "author": "Erika C."}

I inhaled an a\u00e7a\u00ed bowl as I was leaving work, right before I came here. So my tummy was already a bit too occupied for the super thick broth and chashu and delicious noodles of the Tori Paitan Ramen. The broth is creamy and tastes great, definitely, but it was super thick. The friendly people sitting next to us suggested the vegan ramen for next time. \n\nDid I mention the restaurant is small and cozy? The plus side is you get to listen to your neighbors talk about girls they like and their game plan to dating them. Interesting. \n\nI felt ashamed looking at the leftover food.

Mensho was definitely smaller than I expected it to be and the place was pretty crowded. I learned through my friend that this place was actually a place where people would line up to eat at this place because it was really good. For us though, we waited around 5 min before we were seated.\n\nService here was really quick, as they gave us our ramen in a few minutes. For me, I had the Shio Double Chashu Ramen ($11), which had 2 slices of pork. I was a little suurprised though as to how small the bowls were comparing to other ramen places that I've been to. The food itself was pretty good and filled me up. \n\nAlthough the service was quick and the food was good, would I come back specifically to this place again for some ramen? Probably not.

We ordered the oysters first and they came last. Btw, they are not fresh oysters so if you're into that, do NOT get them. Personally, I actually didn't mind them. They're very hearty, not at all refreshing as you would expect if you were expecting fresh oysters. They almost taste like marinated oysters out of a can. Again, I liked them enough to eat 2, but they're pretty overwhelming so I couldn't do anymore.\nBut most importantly, the ramen: we all ordered the Shoyu ramen (btw, I typically like the Tonkotsu which they do not have on the menu) and it was way too fishy tasting and yet kinda bland. I needed chili oil and a garlic spicy chili paste kind of thing to help the broth taste better. The noodles were also not my favorite. They reminded me of fettuccini, not like the ramen noodles I usually like (full disclosure, I like the ramen noodles at Nojo in Hayes Valley or Shin Sen Gumi in LA). \nFor more than an hour wait, I really would have rather gone to Slurp in FiDi...

I've seen long ass lines out this place even in the rain so I decided if I was gonna try this place I'd go when it's not a peak time. My friend and I each ordered the tori paitain, shared enoki chips, and lychee nigori. It was the most beautiful and tasty ramen I've ever had. The rich broth was complex and had so much flavor to it. Noodles tasted handmade. It was so good and so filling I almost couldn't finish it but did just because I couldn't stop eating it haha. The enoki chips were brilliant and a nice snack. The lychee nigori was so refreshing I've never had a lychee nigori before and I've had a lot of sake when I used to work in the industry. \n\nWhile we were eating I couldn't help but notice the manager looked had a friendly familiar face.

My plan of attack was to come straight here right after the halftime Super Bowl show. Line was about 30 people stacked already, but it took us only 45 minutes of waiting. Not bad, considering I overheard people waiting 2-3 hours grand opening night on Saturday. Plan worked! \n\nTotally digging the interior design and details of this place. There's coat hooks on the wall to hang your jacket, woven baskets underneath the table to stash your purse, and even a storage space under the table to keep your phone ready for some picture action. I totally geeked out on the molecular structures and science blurb of umami on the wall. Even the wooden spoon and chopsticks neatly laying on top of the ceramic plate was just perfect.\n\nMe and boyfriend ended up sharing a total of 3 bowls:\n- Tori Paitan ($18): The most decadent of them all, a creamy and rich chicken based broth with pork + duck chashu. The broth was good, however I couldn't get over the slight grittiness of the broth. That duck chashu though! Served with round thick chewy noodles.\n- Oraganic Ramen ($14): A blend of chicken + pork clear broth seasoned with shoyu and comes with pork + duck chasu. Served with flat thick chewy noodles. My boyfriend's favorite of the 3.\n- Shio Ramen ($9): The cheapest bowl and also my favorite. Similar to Organic Ramen, but with a salt (not shoyu). Simple fixings with pork chashu and some fried garlic bits. Served with flat thick chewy noodles.\n\nI loved the clear broths of both the organic and shio ramen. It was flavorfu and not overly salty. Can really taste the complex flavors of seaweed and seafood notes. I like the Shio Ramen just a bit more because of its simplicity, allowing the broth to shine. The broth comes out HOT (the way it should be). I won't lie, I slurped that bowl clean!\n\nThe pork chashu was melt in your mouth delicious. Duck chashu was completely new to my tastebuds and is as amazing as it sounds. Their in-house made ramen noodles are the thicker kind and the shape depends on which bowl you get. The toppings were different, such as fried burdock, kale, or sprouts, but the novelty works.\n\nThere's 28 seats in this joint, but turn over seems fast.

The broth is thicker, heavier, and I would say a little bit creamy. The noodles here are definitely hand made. The broth stuck to the noodles so well that it was like eating soup and noodles at the same time! It was a very harmonious dish. If you're looking for something with a powerful flavor you should get this dish.\n\nOrganic Shoyu - The soup for this ramen isn't as heavy as the Tori Paitan. It is lighter but came across super oily in my opinion. Noodles in my Ramen were in the softer side. So if you like stiff noodles, then don't expect that here.

The food is brought out by type, not by when it was ordered, which may leave you nearly finished with your dinner before your companion receives theirs. Also, seating people 12 at a time to not overwhelm the kitchen when only 7 different dishes and one appetizer are served seems odd to me.  \n\nAlso, details were off - cheap paper napkins, tables too wide for normal conversation (they make you sit across from your companion), empty appetizer plates left on the table until the end of the meal. \n\nFinally, $20 for a bowl of ramen and a glass of water seems excessive, especially with the other issues.

By now, surely you must have heard about the potentially monumental wait times.

But I have heard great things about the vegan ramen and I would want to try that the next time I come back. The quality of the ramen soup is extremely thick, less like a broth and more like a sauce. Although the quantity does not look like much, it will be very filling because of how dense the soup is. Someone also ordered the mazesoba, which is known for a spicy kick and is very delicious. You can get it at a variety of spice levels, but even the medium was pretty hot. Their spicy doesn't \"linger\" the way chili paste sometimes can, but I don't know if I would be able to handle an entire dish of that. We also asked for a recommendation of sake and got the Dassai, which was so good it got me reading a bunch of articles about sake making.\n\nMy recommendation would be to go with people you like because you should just expect a wait of some substance, know that you will be dropping about $20 for a bowl of ramen, and just enjoy the experience without getting hung up on that other stuff.", "author": "Maureen C."}

It was just packed with flavor. The broth was thick and there was heaps of meat inside. The chashu was very delicious and quite possibly the best chashu I had in a bowl of ramen. Well, actually, this is probably the best ramen I've had in my life. I've been to Japan and eaten plenty of too. This was definitely on that japan-level. \n\nThe Shio ramen was very light in comparison to the Tori Paitan. It was very delicious as well. It had a nice clean flavor and was very beautiful. It was very very very good as well, I just preferred the Tori Paitan because I'm a fan of thicker broths. It was paired with flat noodles.\n\nTip, if you order two bowls of ramen start off with the lighter bowl first (not Tori Paitan) because once you go light to thick broth you can really taste and notice the difference of thickness. \n\nThis is by far the best ramen shop in the Bay Area.

While the ramen is undeniably good and I am by no means a ramen connoisseur, I think I would have been similarly satisfied with a bowl at Waraku or Men Oh.  Maybe this was a dangerous product of high expectations combined with over-hype, but my meal last Friday night did not blow me away as much as I had hoped.\n\nMy boyfriend and I got in line at 4:40PM last Friday night, and we missed the first seating by 1 party of two.  The wait didn't feel too terrible--we were seated at 5:36PM--and I was excited to try the much raved-about $18 Tori Paitan (Double Chashu), as well as the $18 Clam Butter Ramen (currently limited to 10 bowls daily).  We also ordered the $5 Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil for appetizer, as well as a $18.55 bottle of Kikusui \"Perfect Snow\" Sake.  Service was fast and we did not have to wait long for our food to come out.\n\nThe Tori Paitan was definitely the highlight of the night.  As many other reviews have noted, the broth is thick and almost gravy-like.  The noodles were hot and just the right amount of chewy, and the the only thing missing from the bowl was a soft-boiled egg.  It was my first time having duck chashu, and I LOVE duck, but I can't say I prefer it any more or less to the standard pork chashu.\n\nThe Clam Butter Ramen was a little more of a miss, and we probably should have ordered something more traditional like the Shio or Shoyu Ramen.  The broth started off tasting light and delicious, but over time the taste of raw seafood (\"like the ocean\") permeated the entire bowl.  My boyfriend noted the noodles were not hot as in the Tori Paitain; perhaps that was to prevent overcooking of the clams and scallops in the dish?  I was expecting the broth to taste a little more \"cooked,\" so I would not recommend this dish if you are adverse to an overly \"raw\" seafood taste.\n\nThe Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil were similarly raw tasting; I love oysters, but from the pictures I did not expect it to taste this much like the ocean.  Some pieces had sand/gravel in them, so at least you know it's fresh?\n\nThe waitresses are prompt in cleaning up your bowls after you are done, which I appreciated; however, they took away my napkin before I was done drinking my sake. :(\n\nOverall, I am not in a rush to return, but on the off-chance I walk by and there is no line, I'd give this place another shot.  Finally, note that they do not offer to-go or take-out containers, but you won't be needing any since the portions run on the small side for the price.", "author": "Amanda W."}

The vegan noodles were springy and thick and were similar in texture and taste as ramen noodles, despite not containing egg. \n\nWe arrived at 5:20pm on a Thursday and waited about an hour before we got seated. Line seemed to move regularly, even though the restaurant could only seat around 20 people.

Very limited seating so if you come here with a group of 4 or more, good luck trying to get a seat. You will probably have to wait for hours until a table opens up. Since its so cramped here you can hear other peoples conversations so clearly. \n\nThe customer service was little but there. The server who looked like the manager was too into getting customers in n out of the restaurant it felt like I was in a food competition where I had to eat as fast as I could. I felt so rushed I could barely enjoy what I was eating. I get that the place is very small and you have a line outside the door but if I am going to pay for over priced ramen I would want to enjoy it. Not only did I feel so rushed trying to finish my food the server denied a customer because they wanted to share a bowl of ramen. I thought this was ridiculous and honestly felt bad for the 2 people who had to leave. \n\nThe food was mediocre at best. To be honest, I would not wait outside to eat at this place. I ordered the Shio Ramen and was very oily. Besides the broth the pork was soft and tender. They add a lot of bamboo to your ramen which I thought was a plus. I really do not understand why this place has so much hype.

Ramen is my JAM. These amateurs obviously don't know ramen. Ramen is always salty. It's not mean to be a bland soup. Also, good food is worth the wait if you have the time to wait and if you want to eat the good food enough. I must admit in SF, many people love to wait BUT there are very few places that I am willing to wait long for the food. This is one of them. \n\nOn a Sunday night around 9:15pm, I waited 45 minutes to eat so I already had high expectations for the food since this is more than the average amount of time I am willing to wait for the food. \n\nI had the tori paitan. I was surprised to hear that they don't have the tonkatsu ramen yet. Should I dock them a star for not having that ready yet? Uh, no. The soup for tori paitan is VERY rich. To the point where it's almost like a gravy. So drink sparingly if you can't handle the richness. I'm used to having tonkatsu ramen hakata style, so while tonkatsu is rich, it's less thick than this variation of tori paitan. So basically I am saying the tori paitan was a bit too rich and thick for my liking. \n\nBut why am I giving this place 5 stars even though I think the broth is too rich and thick? Because it was freaking tasty and the ingredients are fantastic. The ramen goes for $16 which is on the higher end but the ingredients are high quality so you get what you pay for. For those people who gripe over the price probably are those who like bang for buck over quality...not my type of food philosophy. If you want the best ramen in SF and willing to pay on the higher side for it then this is your place. The lines will be long because everyone else wants in on this greatness. Come when you have the time to spare. I certainly don't have much time to spare so I probably won't be coming more than once a month or every other month.

Sadly the locals will disappoint you immediately by dissuading you of this myth and telling you to trek south to the far remote lands of San Mateo and San Jose to seek what you crave. If you're like me and the thought of ever leaving downtown is off the table you've just kind of accepted that you'll never have ramen quite as good as you would in Tokyo or even Los Angeles.\n\nAnd then, Mensho Tokyo opened its doors. Since that day it's been really clear that the inhabitants of San Francisco are suffering from a severe ramen shortage because the lines to eat at this tiny place haven't let up. Part of the reason is that there are only around twenty spots to eat in this place but still, I would have expected the demand to let up a bit after a few months; your best bet is to show up around 4:30pm before the restaurant opens if you want to be seated in less than an hour.\n\nThere is good reason for the demand: the ramen is unquestionably the best in the city. The Tori Paitan has one of the most flavorful broths I've ever tasted and every sip is like having pure concentrated chicken. The Vegan Tantanmen is shockingly savory and meat-like for a dish that is meat-free - I know some of you are likely skeptical of this one but I guarantee you will not be disappointed and go out on a limb here.\n\nI would say that despite how good everything I've eaten here has been I still wouldn't put it up there with my favorite ramens.

It was twice as long by the time we left.

As far as overall experience it's pretty cut and dry there. You pretty much go there for one thing and one thing only, slurp down a delicious bowl of ramen. I stress it is a delicious bowl. I am admitted Ramen Shop (Oakland) disciple and most of what I know of ramen I learned from my experiences there. Mensho is an extension of everything I've learned when it comes to ramen from Japan. The broth was rich and flavorful as one would expect. The prices are higher than your standard bowl of ramen but this is not your standard bowl of ramen. The nori, chasu, and in my case duck complimented the noodles and broth with perfect harmony. \n\nThe room is bright and open but the seating can feel a little tightly packed at times. Not really great for larger groups so keep that in mind. The food comes out quick and fast. Service is pretty much no frills and ready to turn the place over for the next guest. Though it doesn't feel rushed. We were allowed to sit and chat for a bit before we made our way to our next spot. Don't go by the ramen advertised on the wall. The menu is what you need to go by. All in all it was a great meal and worth the wait.", "author": "Joco F."}

Got through half the bowl and just couldn't do it anymore.\n+ Vegan tantan - Upon first taste, was a bit sweet but a lovely complexity and spice/heat comes out as you eat it. A bit of a creamy peanut-y taste. I would probably get this over the tori paitan next time.\n+ Shio - The true favorite. A true broth rather than a creamy soup, it was rich in flavor profile. I could finish this whole bowl by myself, unlike with the other two.\n\nDuck 'chashu' in ramen is new to me... but ended up being a good thing as I love duck and it is served at a perfect medium rare!

We just sat down. we politely told her no but in 2 seconds another Lady came to take our order. seeing the trend, we went ahead and ordered our food and lychee sake for our drink (amazing)!\n\nthe ramen came out pretty fast and what came out looked like a work of art.

The chashu pork was delicious, though!\n\nVegan Tantanmen - despite the consensus, I prefer this one over the Tori Paitan. The broth was a little spicy but it wasn't too creamy. For those who think that the Tori Paitan might be too creamy should try this one! It kind of reminds me of a Thai dish called Kao Soi (which is also delicious). \n\nOysters - this is not your typical oyster in a shell which I expected but turns out to be oyster dipped in shoyu.

Everyone throwing down 5 stars have not had the pleasure of experiencing Totto, Ippudo, or even Marufuku. This is okay ramen, at best. For the price point and portions, it's just mediocre. If you take away the handmade noodles, it's a two-star joint at best, and those two stars would be for their stellar service and system. Otherwise, the hour-long wait for this ramen is not deserved. Maybe it was too hyped up to begin with, the overpowering bamboo quantity and flavor just overwhelmed any sense of the ramen itself. The broth was a hearty chicken stock, but you could only taste the bamboo after the initial. The ramen itself is the perfect amount of springiness, but the kale is for decoration, and the tori paitan (duck breast and pork) could be anything because of the overwhelming flavor of the bamboo. While the quality of the meat was solid, and the texture was tender, $18 for a bowl of this was not worth the wait.

We found Mensho to be the only thing open at the time. There was a little line outside, but only took like 20 mins to get through it. It's a pretty small restaurant and can only fit like 20 ppl at the max? We were sat down at the table nearest to the kitchen, so we're able to see the cooks working their magic.\n\nAs we were ordering the ramen they said they ran out of the 2 that we had just selected...sad panda...so we went with the Shio and Vegan Tantanmen. We also ordered the enoki chips for apps and some sake. GUYS...the enoki chips were sooo good. I'm a huge fan of mushrooms so when I saw these were fried up? That's a must for me. Dip it in the spices that they give you and what a treat. I wish I could talk to you about the Sake, but unfortunately the waitress never brought it to us. The service here was pretty bad (idk if it's because it was later in the night) as we had to ask them for utensils and no one came to refill our water. \n\nThe waitress brought the ramen and we finally got to eat after a long flight from DC. First of all when I saw the Tantanmen, it looked like noodles in peanut butter broth haha. If you order it you'll know what I'm talking about, but nonetheless it was pretty good. The noodles were cooked great, but something was lacking in the bowl itself. Some bean sprouts or some crunch of something. We ordered some chili sauce to put into our ramen too, as we're both spicy food lovers! The big disappointment was the Shio ramen. It just wasn't anything special. I feel like I could've went to the Korean market and picked up a pack of Shin ramen and it would've easily satisfied as well as this bowl did. It didn't have any veggies ( you can order veggies to be added) and it was just so....plain. I guess I'm use to having some veggies in there or some other stuff in there besides the couple piieces of meat, noodles, and broth.\n\nOverall...just a meh meal.

The best friend and I decided we had to come to see if it was really THAT good. We waited an hour and a half just to be seated. And although the host was very friendly all of the waitresses made me feel as though I was doing a disservice to them by requesting water or the bill.\n\nI ordered the tori paitan ramen and my bestie ordered the shoyu. It was actually quite comical as I ended up enjoying hers more so we switched. But the tori paitan was ridiculously rich and the \"soup\" was definitely more of a gravy than an actual soup. I couldn't take a few bites without feeling completely overwhelmed by fat and salt. The shoyu was much lighter although still just as salty. It did however have an amazing mushroom / umami flavor that I was willing to drink a few glasses of water to enjoy. The noodles in the shoyu were more of an egg type noodle than the ramen I am used to. The tori however had more traditional noodles.\n\nAlthough I did not care for the broths I do feel that the meats included in the two ramens were perfectly, delicately cooked and very delicious. I've never had duck chashu and I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. The regular pork chashu was also thinly sliced and amazingly tender. They both just melt in your mouth.\n\nThe bits of kale and seaweed unfortunately did not help enough to combat the overwhelming fat that lingers on your palate which is ultimately what led to my 3 stars.  I honestly feel like this ramen was not to type to be enjoyed on a continuous basis. The flavors were great for that of a tasting menu, but for a full bowl of ramen it was much too salty and heavy to enjoy for more than a few bites.

I went on the Wednesday after the weekend opening. I know you expect lines for food in San Francisco but this is first time I've waited this long for a ramen place in the city. Expect to wait 1.5 hours for the dinner rush. I do hear that the lines die down around 10pm (it closes at 12).\n\nAs for the food, my friends and I all ordered the Tori Paitan which was a rich creamy chicken broth with pork chasiu and duck. The broth is very heavy and flavorful. I like the flavor but I felt that it was a too salty for my preferences. The noodles were a perfect texture and the meat was delicious. The burdock added a contrast in texture as well as the kale, but I could do without these two. \n\nThe Tori Paitan is a little more expensive for ramen at $16. I'm interested in trying the other ramen dishes and perhaps going for a less creamy broth. However, I don't feel that it's worth it to wait nearly 90 minutes for it.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

Trust me, you have enough time.\n- Meditate: You probably won't do this, but I'm not going to lie, my hangryness was taking over my body real quick.

I wouldn't order them again. The Tori Paitan ramen on the other hand, was delicious. The chashu and duck melted in your mouth, the noodles were perfect, and the broth was so very rich and creamy.

We arrived at 9:30 and had ordered around 10:20. Definitely not bad considering other reviews of up to 2 hour wait times. We both ordered the single Tori Paitan $18, which is the most popular here. Took a taste of that broth and DIED! I never really understood the concept of umami until that hit my taste buds. It is an indescribable taste that comes in a thicker than normal broth and the most perfectly cooked noodles. The broth tastes almost oily/fatty and buttery at the same time, but the taste you get is just insane. I didn't care much for the chashu, but they were excellently cooked. \nCurrently saving up my quarters for my next visit because that broth is something I need again. It's addicting I promise you. \n\n***Communal Tables Only***\n- This isn't the type of place where you can sit and gossip about your friend and her new boyfriend after you finish your ramen.

The other patrons were a blast to be around - we agreed that it was strange to have only 6 seated until the food arrived but it was thrilling to be part of the exhibit. This is the nature of grand openings so I imagine Mensho will have it sussed out very soon. \n\nI opted for the tori paitan ramen with two slices of chashu. The handmade noodles were stellar with the appropriate texture and chewiness. The noodles perfectly absorbed the rich and balanced broth. I would have been able to finish it had I not camped out for happy hour at the friendly Resolute next door. My objectivity for this review is compromised because I had a relaxing time lined up an hour and a half before opening. In my mind, it was guaranteed to be a great experience.\n\nAbram was a delightful host. His enthusiasm and engagement with the crowd were appropriately uplifting for the public opening. Chef Shono's spirits were high and he personally delivered my bowl with a smile and a handshake. I'll never forget the connection when he reciprocated my emphatic thumbs up through the kitchen window. \n\nMiscellany:\n- The beer selection is stellar. the Suntory malt and the Sansho may not have been the best standalone beers but they paired so well with the tori paitan. It was nice to see a change in roster for the typical ramen house beverages.\n- They use Square payment and were able to quickly rectify an erroneous bill.\n- The music selection was hilariously comforting. It was what seemed to be a wedding covers playlist during the first hour - including hits like a diluted acoustic version of Peter Cetera's \"Glory of Love\"\n- There's a clipboard. The sequence of names was honored for at least the first 6 people (mild gloating). \n\nThe per bowl pricing is higher than average but it was worth it to be part of the spectacle. Cheers to Mensho!

The hope of getting inside rests on how close you can see the front of the line, and your fellow food-lovers inside taking their quick, or sweet time devouring their delectable ramen. Parking for me came at an ease, but be sure you take all your valuables and leave nothing exposed. Wait time? 2 hours for me. Granted it was a Saturday night at 6:30 so it was to be expected. Now for the star of the night, which didn't shine as bright as I expected. Tori paitan, rich, creamy, broth paired with perfectly cooked ramen and tender, melt in your mouth chasiu. Sounds perfect right? Unfortunately for me, it didn't pan out that way. You know when you get to the bottom of a carton of OJ that's settled and you get all the pulp (no offense to pulp)? My broth tasted like it's equivalent. It came out extremely frothy and with crystalized salty bits, which made me think it was the very end of a pot. Not entirely sure if this was true, but that's my assumption, esp after tasting another party member's order.

I literally had chicken p\u00e2t\u00e9 the week before at another popular restaurant in SF and the flavor profile was very similar.  It tasted good, but I don't think I could eat it on a regular basis.  There were two types of chashu in the dish, pork and duck.  I have never had duck chashu before, but it was very tender and succulent and did not taste fatty or oily compared to Chinese roast duck.  The accoutrements with the food were pretty decent with the bamboo shoots, bonito flakes, etc.  The burdock root was a nice surprise with the katsuobushi sauce as it made it taste like there was bacon in the dish almost (or like bacon + brussel sprouts taste).  In terms of the noodles themselves, they were not as firm/springy as I would have liked, and it seemed as though I got all really short/cut up noodles and not the long strands of noodles where you can \"slurp\" the noodles as a sign of respect that you like the dish.  This could have just been my particular bowl as I noticed others in my party had longer noodles.\n\nOverall, worth a try, I probably wouldn't wait another hour for the bowl if I was really craving ramen as there are other places to get my ramen fix, but a solid choice/restaurant to visit.", "author": "Lawrence E."}

Texture and saltiness were about the same. Would've never guessed it was oysters. \n\nThe Ramen:\n\nWhen I arrived at Mensho, I saw signs everywhere that said Tsukemen. I was extremely happy and anxious because not a lot of places serves it. I've been on a search of Tsukemen for quite awhile after my trip to Tokyo in 2011. We I saw their menu, no Tsukemen . It's plastered everywhere on their wall but no go. So I opted for their Tori Paitan double order of chashu. \n\nInteresting take on ramen. Their broth is extremely thick and one note. Noodles were cooked perfectly and had the right amount of chewiness and texture. Duck chashu was pretty good but their pork chashu was the highlight of the dish. \n\nOverall, nothing impressive about their ramen. I'm just glad it wasn't bland.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-17", "description": "As the reviews have mentioned, it's a small place with no reservations so it can take a long time to get a table.  Luckily for us, we arrived at a good time and only waited 20 minutes for a table for 4.  But I heard it can take up to 1-2 hours.\n\nThe place looks really clean and well maintained.  I ordered the vegan ramen and my friends ordered the pork ramen.  Generally, I have avoided the vegan ramen since it's usually flavorless and doesn't have a good salt/unami ratio.  But at this place, holy heaven, it was amazing!\n\nThe vegan ramen has an awesome balance of saltiness and flavor.  It has 7 nuts in it to make sure it has the right amount of sweetness and fat to complement the salt.  As for spice level, it was not spicy for me, but I had the option of getting the hot sauce and add it to the side.  There was some menma (fermented banboo) but I was not a fan of that.  Overall, spicy, salty and the fat perfectly complemented the tantanmen noodles.  I can say this is the best vegan ramen I tasted so far!\n\nMy friends who ordered the pork ramen loved it, but did complain that there was a little too much fat in it, but loved the flavor.  \n\nFor alcohol, I ordered some sake and they presented different from what I am accustomed.  They gave you the small glass and a wood saucer and filled it with sake until both the glass and saucer was filled.  I didn't complain, more sake for me.  Staff was friendly and food came out pretty fast (less than 10 minutes).  It can be expensive since we spent about $25 per person and only half of us ordered alcohol.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend if you want ramen and have a vegetarian/vegan friend.\n\nSide note not affecting review:  They have two compounds painted high in the wall (see pictures).  As a chemist, I am familiar with some food additives especially Mono-Sodium Glutamate, aka as MSG or Unami flavor, all which is natural in yeast extract.  I first thought that it would be MSG, but actually it's not.  You see, glutamate is a natural amino acid and it is in the \"top\" part of the compound pictured.  However, there's a bottom part attached to the nitrogen \"N-H\" that's whole benzene group with an amino group.  I investigated it during dinner (my friends know I would do something like that), and found out that the compound they have pictured is actually N-(4-Aminobenzoyl)-L-glutamic acid which is commonly used as UV absorbing tag for starches (used in analytical chemistry to detect compounds).  I am pretty sure they're not giving us that, so I would recommend to the owner to fix the image since it's just plainly wrong.\nThe other compound they have featured is Inosinic acid which is a non-canonical nucleotide in RNA but totally natural.  If it were me, I would delete the phosphate part (i.e. the \"P=O\" part) in the picture, but it's fine.", "author": "Bryan A."}

However, they seem to always have spots for people who are eating alone so I was lucky enough to come on my own and not have any wait.\n\nI ordered the Tori Paitan Double Chashu ramen with a side of fried enoki mushrooms. Given that this is a Paitan ramen, I knew that the broth was going to be very thick and heavy bordering on a gravy-like consistency. It's not particularly common so I understand how some people might not be particular fans of this style.  \n\nThe fried enoki were very crispy and delicious but if you let them sit for a bit, they start to really develop that oily feel in your mouth which is a no-go for me. The ramen was very good. I was a little hesitant when they told me there was kale in it (This kale phenomenon in SF is getting ridiculously out of hand) but it was surprisingly good and didn't have the strong bitter taste of kale. I also think you need to order the double chashu since the meat was extremely tender and good but a double portion felt just right and not too much.\n\nAll in all, this was a great experience and I would like to come back but at $18 for a bowl, I think that's just ridiculous. Maybe it's because SF is so expensive but even the Tokyo branch is almost half the price of SF. Given that most other ramen places in this vicinity have yet to come close to what I've had here, it's probably the only place I could recommend for good ramen if you're in the city and want some place that's not too difficult or will take too long to get to.", "author": "Ray L."}

I've had ramen from a number of top ramen restaurants on the west coast, as well as quite a few authentic ramen shops in Tokyo.  There are many types of ramen, so it's important to frame my review with the kind I prefer, which is hakata ramen, which has very thick broth.  This definitely delivers.  Additionally, it's different, unique, and it's clear they try new things that really work, all while still delivering an authentic taste.  That being said, I don't think it quite lives up to the hype I've heard.  There are many comparable ramen shops.  Come here if you want something that's very good as well as unique, but don't expect it to outclass other top-tier places, either.\n\nOne real complaint: I found that the dregs of the broth are a bit gritty, like there is a fine silt which sinks to the bottom.  This makes drinking the remainder impossible to enjoy, something I've never encountered at a ramen shop before.  Ramen aficionados always slurp the broth remaining, right?

The line was about 60 people deep. Unfortunately the inside is very small (seats about 28 people or so) and people seem to take a while to eat their ramen so the line moves but isn't that quick.  When you get to the front of the line the waiter takes your order so you get your food quicker, but even then it does take about 7 minutes to get your food.  \n\nATMOSPHERE: The inside is small with 2 sets of long communal high tables.  If you're with a weird number expect to sit with or close to strangers.  There is also a small counter/bar area that is regular height and seats 4.  If you come here alone they will come out and ask for \"party of 1?\" so you can take advantage.  Inside is pretty modern with information about their ramen on the walls, a TV that plays ramen videos and modern Japanese music.  The kitchen is open so you can see them making the ramen.\n\nFOOD:\n\nTORI PAITAN - my first time having this kind of ramen.  I was drawn to this place because the pictures made the noodles look really thick and curly - my favorite! When the ramen first came out, it was very frothy on top because they whisk it before serving.  The broth was a bit of a disappointment because it was so thick it was almost like a gravy.  The taste was decent, not quite as tasty as other broths I've had (Orenchi, Tsujita) but pretty \"intense.\"  The noodles were also a disappointment, they looked so good but they fell flat! They weren't chewy.  They had a different color and texture to them than normal ramen noodles like at Tsujita or Orenchi, and they weren't yellow.  This leads me to believe that they have a different type of flour in them that don't give them as much bounce as I was hoping.  They definitely were thick though, which was good.  As for the toppings, the pork was cold and a little gelatin-like.  The actual meat part almost had the same consistency as the fatty parts.  I did enjoy the duck meat though, very flavorful and good.  The kale was interesting but kind of hard to eat.  I did notice that they do not offer an egg, which is interesting.\n\nI'm starting to think that Tsukemen noodles tend to be the chewiest because they are not cooked in soup.  Next time, I would get the Tsukemen.  The problem is that they only have a certain number of bowls.  \n\nOverall, it wasn't worth the 1.5 hour wait in my opinion.  I could definitely see why people would like this ramen because of the unique flavor and noodles but overall, I would rather go to Orenchi Beyond if I was in SF.", "author": "Brittany T."}

To charge us for a $20 bowl of Ramen that I didn't even touch was uncalled for. I left the place upset and still hungry, and that's not how you ever want to guest leaving your establishment. I'm not saying they should have taken the Ramen off of the bill, but they could have offered to take it away and remake it like my fianc\u00e9's, or when I mentioned how I liked how spicy his was, they could've offered to bring out some kind of spicy sauce or seasoning.

We had the Tori paitan, which is a creamy chicken broth ramen with pork and duck chashu, along with their draft beer.\n\nThe broth was rich, flavorful, umami goodness (despite being fully chicken, no pork), and the noodles were a thicker variety with nice chewiness. The pork and duck chashu were nicely salty, tender, and tasty. I didn't care for the odd texture of the vegetable toppings, and would've preferred something a little more crisp, maybe with something pickled.  The service was friendly and efficient, especially considering they are still early in their rollout.  Once we were seated, we ordered immediately and were served and finished in about 30 minutes. \n\nThe final tally for two ramens, extra chashu, and two draft beers was $56 without tip.

Luckily, we got in for the first sitting.\n\nI tried the tori paitan with double chashu.  Really rich with complex flavors.  The chashu was so tender that it almost melted in your mouth.  It was really good ramen.  \n\nOur server didn't speak english very well, so I think she had a hard time taking our order.  In the end, I corrected her on what I wanted to order, but I was left wondering if she actually understood what I wanted.  Thankfully it all worked out in the end and I got my correct order.  The server was very nice, though, and came back often to check up on us.\n\nFor the first sitting, I believe they make each of the different types of ramen in series.  For us, all of the tori paitans in the restaurant came out at the same time.  Then the next type, followed by a different type. This means that some folks might be halfway finished before others get their ramen.  (I don't recommend waiting since the ramen will get cold!)  This was true for our first sitting, so I'm not sure if that happens every day.  Just be prepared.\n\nOverall, the food was great and I'd like to come back to try their different varieties.

I'd definitely say the flavors are Americanized. It's not a bad thing but it's not what I like to eat. There was kale used for the veggies which was kind of a letdown. The duck chasu however was pleasantly delicious. Chashu was mediocre. We also ordered the oysters in shoyu dare oil appetizer. They were just OK. Think pickled oysters. \n\nYou leave with sticky lips which I love after eating ramen but the flavor profile isn't your traditional flavor so just know that going in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-16", "description": "The wait is SO NOT worth it. \n\nMy friends and I (party of 5) came to try the hype and because it's pretty unusual for a ramen place to have vegetarian or vegan options since the broth is usually made with meat. We came here around 7:15pm and stood about 5 feet from the Alcatraz theatre sign. A waitress came to take down our name, and we asked how long the wait was. She said from the sign, it would be about an hour. We decided to wait, but her estimate was far from what the actual wait turned out to be. It took us almost an hour to get to the sign, and in total, we waited 2.5 hours. \n\nWhat turned my friends off the most was the service. Their seating system is the most inefficient that we have ever seen. It was baffling. Granted, our party is on the bigger side, and there are only 4 tables and a bar to sit at so approximately 35 seats in the restaurant. Their seating system really puts people with more than 2 or 3 people at a disadvantage because they won't seat you unless a party with the same number of people leaves. Once we reached the front and there were only 2 more parties in front of us, the waitress told us that we would take the table of the group of 5 that just sat down even though there was a group of 3 that was leaving. We asked if we could split up because the people next to the group of 3 on their way out would probably finish within 15 minutes. She said no because then the time of serving the food to our party would be  vary and that's not allowed. We were so confused as to why that should be a problem if we were okay with it. And if that were really a problem, since the party next to the group of 3 was close to done, it would have been practical for her to save those three seats until the other party finished so that we would all be seated at the same time. Instead, she gave it to another party behind us and multiple parties behind us went before we even got in. In total, it was a 2.5 hour wait. By the end of the wait, we were fuming at the inefficiency because it was extremely unfair that we couldn't be seated even if we agreed to split up. As we were making our way out, the same waitress, an older woman who seemed to be the manager, stopped my friend and yelled at her for not giving enough tip and demanded more. We were all in shock because we have never been put in a situation like this before. My friend said no because she explained her to how she thought the seating system was inefficient and the wait wasn't worth it. The lady then proceeded to tell her, \"If you don't want to wait, don't come back.\" We waited because we thought it would only be an hour because that's what we were told, and a lot of people would be seated faster and the line would move faster had their system been more efficient. She has our WORD that we will not be returning. \n\nFinally, onto the food. I ordered the chicken paitan ramen because that's what everyone was raving about. Upon being seated, they took our order pretty quickly and the food came pretty fast (~10-15min). Upon tasting the soup, my friends and I looked at each other with furrowed eyebrows, and said, \"it's so salty.\" This was not just the case with the chicken paitan, but my friend who had the vegan tantanmen also said hers was really salty too. You could definitely tell that the chicken broth was cooked for a long time because the natural flavors of the chicken were prominent, but I thought the broth was too heavy, salty and creamy in a bad way. I drank SO much water while eating the bowl of ramen, and 3 hours later, I'm still thirsty and my mouth is super dry. I appreciated the innovation of incorporating different ingredients that aren't traditionally seen in ramen such as kale. I am willing to accept kale because it offered a change in texture within the different types of vegetables, but I was NOT a fan of the duck. I thought that having a chicken broth with pork and duck chashu was WAY too much. 3 different types of meat in one dish and it felt like all the flavors were clashing. I liked the pork chashu though; it just melted in your mouth. The noodles were also cooked al dente and chewy. My friends and I were disappointed that there wasn't even a soft boiled egg in a bowl of ramen that costed $18. There were a lot of noodles and I was full, but I definitely will not be back.", "author": "Sharon C."}

Don't line up. After all my princess thoughts (lol), our orders came & it was like they slapped me silly.. With deliciousness. I ordered the vegetarian. When I tell you, I wasn't hungry.. But dammit it was too good. Ramen was fresh. Broth had this delightful heaviness (like a coconut cream curry) but they added a sesame oil with some spice to add heat to my soup of flavor. The cilantro & peanuts were a great dimension. My taste buds were dancing to the salsa music playing overhead while I ate Japanese food. Lol. Anyhow, it was the best vegetarian ramen I've had.

I told him I've been wanting to try this ramen restaurant that makes their noodles in house. So what do we do? We drove by to see how bad the line was. We saw two people in line, which meant we would catch the second seating.\n\nI dropped the hubby off to stand in line while I circled for parking, which was atrocious at the time. Make sure you don't park in a spot that's a tow away zone from 4-6pm! When I finally got parking, hubby was 5th in line. Not too bad. We were seated within 20 minutes of my dropping him off.\n\nWhen we were at the front of the line, the server asked us what we wanted to order. This way our food would be served to us shortly after we were seated. As others have mentioned, this is communal type seating in a small space. I couldn't quite carry a conversation with my husband because it was so loud.\n\nWe ordered (1) enoki chips (2) tori paitan chashu ramen (3) organic shoyu double chashu ramen (3) sansho beer. We received the organic shoyu ramen first which was slightly fishy and caught me off guard. It wasn't bad just very different. The noodle were also flat noodles, which was also different from other ramen places I've tried. Next we receive the tori pain tan which came with noodles similar to chow mein. We both preferred the tori paitan broth. It was much richer and, for lack of a better word, the texture of the soup was \"fluffy.\" We then received our appetizer, which was fried enoki. We never had a dish like it and would order it again.\n\nService at the establishment needs work. The communal tables have these weird cubbies that the workers place setting in them. Without an excuse me, the workers would reach into the cubbies and startle patrons. I would never expect for someone to reach for something in front of my stomach. They should either (1) learn to say excuse me (2) place these setting elsewhere. I'm not one that dings an establishment for service but more of an FYI.\n\nWould I go back? Only if the wait didn't exceed the one we experienced. Considering the price point (our tab was over $60 with tip), I can't justify waiting 1+ hours for ramen with mediocre service. Was it good?

The pork chashu was flavorful but a little over stewed. The duck chashu had good texture but had an herbal flavor that I couldn't pinpoint. Why is there kale and random cabbage in the broth?

I was craving ramen given the evening weather was chilly and we had walked around all day and needed something to comfort the soul. I saw that mensho was a less than 10 minute drive from our hotel and so it was meant to be. After some quick review checking, I noticed a trend that the vegan ramen was quite popular. I'm not vegan, but given the lack of decent vegan/veg options back in Texas, I had to jump on the opportunity to try this! To start, the wait to get inside really wasn't that bad (sunday night). We waited (for 2) for just about 30 minutes (got inside around 9p). The efficiency of this restaurant is impeccable! I'm not used to tiny restaurants, but the way they prioritize parties to maximize the number of seats that will be filled is just brilliant. So once we're in, everything is pretty quick. The minimalist vibe of the place, both the menu and decor, enhances the eating experience. You don't feel rushed or overwhelmed. You don't need lots of time to decide on something. And it's quite intimate and friendly since you're seated right next to complete strangers. \n\nWe ordered the oysters to start.They were very bold--strong flavor and good texture. The ramen. Oh, the ramen. I still dream about the ramen from time to time, particularly on cloudy or rainy days. The cream based broth totally elevates the whole dish by adding extra texture and a richness you may not find in a clear broth. There are 7 types of nuts in there, which add depth and crunch. The addition of chili oil balances the richness of it and the fresh cilantro and edamame round it all together. \n\nIt is seriously addictive.", "author": "Nazia H."}

So, when my coworkers were deciding on an early dinner one night, we stopped by to see if there would be a line and lo and behold (despite the restaurant being full) we were the first in line outside. \n\nI learned why there is always this line, that makes it appear to be deceptively popular. The restaurant itself is rather tiny, only seating maybe 20 or so people at once. \n\nSEATING: You get seated at these long, communal tables so seating can get a little complicated if you have a big party. \n\nBROTH: If you enjoy super rich, creamy, thick broth then this is your place. I have to be honest, I really enjoyed the broth. It was unique, savory, and really really hit the spot. \n\nNOODLES: The Ume broth and Tori Paitan broths were delicious, but the noodles themselves were different from what I was used to (not bad, just not what I was expecting from a bowl of ramen).\n\nPRICE: I would've given this place maybe 4/5... Unfortunately, I think the priciness of each bowl kind of put me off. It was about $16-18 per bowl, and the bowls weren't particularly large nor did it come with a lot of toppings. That was disappointing. I just can't justify paying that much for ramen, when I've had ramen that has tasted just as great (or even better) over in San Mateo for less. \n\nSERVICE: Because of the table arrangement, it was really difficult for the servers to get around us without reaching around / over you which was kind of uncomfortable. We also felt super rushed - they asked us MULTIPLE times whether we were done (and we're not even slow eaters), and tried to bus our bowls away on several occasions while we were still working on drinking the broth. I used to be a waitress, so I understand the importance of turning over tables, but definitely not at the expense of your customers' dining experience.\n\nAll in all, would I come back? Maybe.. if I was in the area and there's no line. The broth is definitely unique enough that I might come back, and it's worth a try if you've never had it. \n\nMaybe next time will be better!", "author": "Jessica J."}

Would I wait more than an hour for this place? Probably not. If I am with friends who are fun and willing to wait, probably yes. I'm all about the foodie adventure! \n\nCompared to other ramen places, the broth is what made this place stand out. I got the Tori Paitan. The broth is rich and creamy. I loved the duck cashu. I've never had that before and it went very well with the broth. The noodles are thick the way I like. Everything just meshed together. I just wish you could add a marinated soft boiled egg.\n\n I also ordered the Oysters in Shoyu Dare Oil. They were interesting... not what you expect when you think of oysters. Tasted like oysters from a can drenched in soy sauce. I wasn't a fan. Also, I wanted to try a spicy ramen but they didn't have it yet. It was on the wall menu but I'd like to come back and try it.\n\nThis place is super small and you will probably end up at a communal table. Interesting fact I learned from someone I met at my communal table: the ramen broth making process in Japan would not meet food safety requirements here in the US.

What the hell was I thinking?!??!\n\nDefinitely disappointed by the experience and the quality.  Do yourself a favor, if you love ramen, go to Himawari in San Mateo and get the Tan Tan Men Deluxe:\nhttps://www.yelp.com/biz/himawari-san-mateo\n\nBeing a fan of thick, creamy broth, I decided to get the Tori Paitan.  The stock was definitely thick, but it had this grainy texture that was not appealing.  The noodles were definitely thick and good.  The ramen includes a paltry slice of pork, duck and a few pieces of bamboo to supplement the soup and noodles.  Having eaten at Himawari and Orenchi, by far this is not a value.\n\nI have tried to go to this place numerous times but the line and waiting system is just ridiculous.  Standing like cattle, tethered to a line might be a psychological factor for attracting customers and a form of free advertisement, but it's completely intolerable.  There are name lists, pagers and call back options the business could have implemented to make better use of your time.  \n\nFor you city folk, do yourself a favor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-24", "description": "My boss had told me about this new ramen shop opening up months ago, and I decided it was about time to brave the line and try it out. I started standing in line at 5:30, and wasn't in the restaurant until 7:15. Service was immediate, seating is communal which is smart for a ramen shop, and overall the atmosphere was positive. \n\nWe started off with the oyster appetizer which was outstanding! The oysters (4 on a plate) came prepared in a semi-dried treatment, yet still oozed with texture and flavour of the soy sauce. It was a surprising burst of flavour, sweet and salty, with a slight tang of nut and acidity. \n\nThe tori paitan with double chasu came in the perfect size, with the right soup to noodle ratio; however, the ratio of toppings to the noodle+ soup was underwhelming and disappointing. While I thoroughly enjoyed the menma and burdock, which provided a punch of saltiness and texture to the ramen, the kale was the odd one out, arriving in a sad lump of overly cooked green mess. I do love my noodles and soup, I just wish there were more toppings to accommodate the carby goodness. I feel like the lack of egg is a good thing, as the soup itself is already very rich. I first tasted the broth, which was lacking in flavour and almost seemed like a thick and creamy gravy, as another yelp reviewer pointed out. Granted, this is the second paitan I've ever tried, but it just seemed like the thickness of the broth should have been remedied with more spices or whatnot. By the end of the ramen, I had no desire to continue drinking (eating?) the broth. It is true that the broth is slightly grainier towards the bottom of the bowl.  \n\nThe strangest thing was that everything in the bowl was fairly lukewarm which was alarming when I first tried it, however the noodles were steaming hot in contrast! Once you mix the bowl up, the broth becomes steamier and the temperature is more balanced out. Unfortunately the meat is still not hot, something I prefer my meat to be in all of my ramens. The duck was the winner compared to the pork chasu, which I've had better pork chasu's at Parlor or other places. I tried the broth of the soyu ramen which was delicious, just a tad bit too salty. The noodles for the paitain were thick and Al Dente, for the shoyu they were flatter but still consistent in springiness and chewiness.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food here. You can tell that it's high quality, and made with a lot of thought and love. I would come here after the chef arrives back from Japan and the other dishes are in stock--very eager to try the tonkotsu and the umi miso ramen (miso ramen is my favourite!! Go to Ramen Parlor for a bomb miso ramen). There are also tsukemen ramen and soba that are in the works. I don't think I would get the tori paitan often, just once in a while when I'm craving a whole lot of richness and comfort food in the form of japanese cuisine. I prefer the chicken paitan at Nojo's which is impeccable and much tastier in my opinion in terms of broth and overall balance.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

So on the night of the grand opening, we left about 20 minutes early and walked to Geary near Leavenworth to find . . . about 70 people already lined up.  We went to the back of the line and prepared to wait a while.  Six o'clock came and went.  I walked up and looked at the entrance and saw that the door was still closed and there were no signs of activity inside.  Another 15 minutes passed and my wife walked up to check on the progress.  Still no one going in.  Fifteen minutes later, there were SIX patrons in the place and by now, more than 100 waiting in line.  By 6:45, 45 minutes after Mensho was supposed to open, we had moved forward about 8 feet.  \n\nNot being gluttons for punishment, we gave up and walked past the entrance to Mensho to Osha Thai.  Pausing, we took a look inside.  Of the restaurant's two long tables (yes, they really only have 2 tables), only one was in use.  And most disturbingly, NO ONE HAD ANY FOOD.  Forty-five minutes later, after an excellent dinner at Osha, we wandered back down to see how much the line had moved.  The girl who had been waiting just in front of us had moved forward no more than 15 feet; there were still at least 60 people in front of her.  There's just no excuse for a restaurant's grand opening moving at such a glacial pace.  \n\nI've worked in restaurant service in San Francisco before and know the mechanics of getting patrons in, getting their orders, getting their food and getting them on their way.  These people seemed clueless.  San Francisco is a foodie town, but we're not masochists and we don't like having to accommodate unprofessionalism.  There are a hundred ways to avoid this kind of debacle.  Do a soft opening for a week or two, and limit your patrons for that time to reservation-only, to get your staff up to speed and iron out the kinks.  Open just for weekday lunches for a couple of weeks, for the same reason.  And don't advertise the hell out of a grand opening but then choke when 100 people line up outside.  You only get one chance to make a first impression, and Mensho blew it for us.\n\nAlso, we glanced at the menu: the items that we had hoped to be able to order -- their vegan ramen -- were $18 a bowl.  I've eaten a LOT of noodles all over Japan and even in the priciest neighborhoods of Tokyo, where rent is much higher than in the Tender-Nob, it's never been more than $10 for a bowl of veggie ramen in a place like Mensho.  $18 for a bowl of ramen noodles and a few vegetables and some dashi?  Ridiculous.  And why does their vegan ramen cost MORE than their ramen that has meat in it?!  The late Kare-Ken, which was a block closer to Union Square, served up an excellent bowl of veggie curry udon for $8.  Is Mensho's ramen somehow worth more than twice as much?\n\nI have to wonder how long this place is going to last.", "author": "Curran H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-07", "description": "Waited for more than 3 hours in line for my perfect bowl of happiness but went home feeling a little let down, and woke up still w/ that damn curly leave of kale in my bowl haunting me this am.  Let me explain - I grew up in restaurants, worked in both small & large-scale operations, lived in Japan & LOVE ramen.  Please pardon the long review as I'm about to share...\n\nWAIT - I get it's the long anticipated grand opening, and over SB50 weekend no less but you should know there's such thing as a soft opening to work out all the kinks before your highly-anticipated US debut.  Never mind the 3hr+ wait, train your staff to know the mechanics of seating & managing a hungry mob outside.  I came by myself & waited in line patiently before the door opened but noticed how they failed to move the line (you see a LOT when you had to go thru a long wait like mine).  There were plenty of single seats available throughout the evening but they never seated solo diners to ease the line...guess they wanted to be fair to others who waited (which I get) but this only added to the angry crowd.  Either 1) designate a few chairs for solo diners to ease the line or 2) insert them where there's already a single diner seating across from an EMPTY chair or 3) seat them where there's a party of 3 or 5.  This is a ramen joint not a fancy sit-down, so operate like one...in, out & no one gets hurt!\n\nMENU - Once inside, waited yet again patiently for a menu, any menu...at this point, I was weak from enduring the cold and just sat in silence getting warm-up but quickly found out how hectic the place was w/ no server in sight, so as soon as a waitress showed up I had to flag her down for a menu.  What amazed me was the moment she handed me the menu, she asked whether I was ready to order!  I told her you just gave me the menu so please give me a sec, so she stood there expecting for an order, instantly.  Menu was limited during grand opening, no Mensho \"welcome ramen\", no chicken karaage, etc...just ramen for now.\n\nFOOD - I'm a Tonkatsu Ramen lover, was shocked to see there's none offered out of the 7 types of ramen on the menu.  I ordered the $18 Tori Paitan Chashu Ramen, got served w/o too long of a wait (yay but $18??!!).  But wait...my spoon was missing from my setting...BIG no-no!  I came so close to happiness thinking they got 1 thing right - prompt food delivery.  At this point, my ramen is just mocking me.  Such a slap in the face since I couldn't properly enjoy it like the next guy who got his food just before me but he's happily slurping away tasting the broth w/ his SPOON!  I waited yet again for my waitress to reappear and asked for spoons for me & others at my table who were also missing theirs as I observed spoons were all missing from our settings.  Finally, I just dived in, too hungry to wait around for a silly spoon while my ramen's getting cold (another no-no)...who cares if I had to hold the bowl up like I was in Japan just to taste that rich, creamy broth full of yummy umami.  \n\nForget the traditional toppings of a sexy ramen 1/2 egg, nori, menma (bamboo shoot) etc...you get fried gobo (burdock root), a few chives mixed in, an odd curly leaf of kale which haunts me like an unnecessary garnish of a curly parsley in any bad dishes I've seen (let alone in a Mensho ramen).  The broth tasted incredible and lived up to the Mensho name.  I can just see how much time & effort that went into it, but the noodles was just too thick for the already thick broth.  I couldn't help but envy others who had a different flat noodle in their ramen.  Guess I'll have to come back when their ramen machine is up & running to taste it again, but for now the thick noodles just don't really belong in that rich broth...I can see it being an incredible ramen dish served cold as the noodles were perfectly chewy & got a great bite!  \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE - I was so hungry, I finished my bowl under 10min vs. my 3hr+ wait outside but at least tummy got fed.  Waited patiently for my check which never came since my waitress whom I finally had to flag down for a check said they had lost my check after some investigating.  She later came back w/ a manual check but never came back to gather my cc.  I sat & observed how hectic the place was still at 9:40pm and realized how green the staff must had been w/o much training as to offer proper customer service.  Finally, I had to flag down another waitress who was nice enough to run back w/ my cc.\n\nOVERALL - 3.5 stars and will wait for them to work out the kinks & all the hype before returning.  Lots of ideas for improvement.  It will be interesting to see if anything improved then.  I really wanted to try another bowl of ramen (that tells you how much I wanted to like Mensho) but didn't want to wait & go home at midnight due to the sheer chaos.\n\nP.S. our table (long table closet to kitchen against the wall) kept collapsing a bit on us any time someone puts their elbow down.

The soup was a great change of pace from the same old tepid, weak tonkotsu broth with curly pre-frozen noodles that you can get elsewhere in the area. The chashu was generous and delicious: a soft and fatty round of simmered pork, with two juicy slices of duck meat on the side. The tori paitan is thick and rich, for those of you who like a ramen with more body, and the noodles are appropriately matched. Agreed with others that the sprig of kale isn't much to my liking, and I miss having some of my Japanese ramen favorites (menma is a big one for me), but the fried gobo is excellent and adds a flavor that a lot of Americans aren't familiar with. The shio ramen at $9 is the single best value bowl of ramen I've had in the US: the shoyu just edges it out, but for those looking for something delicious that won't weigh you down, it's a proper shio ramen with a strong chicken flavor. The garlic tends to settle on the bottom, which leads to an interesting shift in flavor as you make your way through the bowl and the garlic sits longer in the remaining soup.\n\nThis feels like a shop transplanted from Tokyo (which it is), and beats out every one of the other 36 ramen shops I've tried across the US to take the title of #1. It competes handily with the best shops in Tokyo as well. The interior is beautifully appointed, clean, and modern, and I love that they've turned the entire restaurant into counter seating (albeit with the concession of counter-height tables for groups) for a more Japanese dining experience.\n\nThey're not launching with everything on the menu, and they're waiting on the go-ahead from the health department before they can start making their own noodles with the machine that they imported from Japan, but Mensho Tokyo is already far and away better than anything else available in the area. Can't wait until they finish sourcing ingredients and start serving additional items from the menu! When that happens, we'll finally be able to have proper tsukemen in the Bay Area. Crossing my fingers that the tori paitan gyokai will be reminiscent of Fuunji in Tokyo!\n\nSF is in for a real treat. This place is worth the wait.", "author": "Kevin L."}

A round, floppy blob. If this is death by food, then this is the way I want to go. \n\nI stopped by here with a friend after work. At 6:10pm on a Tuesday, the line was already at 30-40 people and it took us over 1.5 hours to get seated. Luckily, the long line offered us ample opportunity to stare wistfully through the window. Making patrons uncomfortable? My specialty. Besides, that just means they'll eat faster.\n\nAfter consulting Yelp (cause food fomo is a real thing),  we both settled on the Tori Paitan Ramen. I ambitiously opted for the double chashu- spoiler: there were no regrets.\n\nThe Ramen itself came out fairly quickly (maybe about 10-15 min?) and looked absolutely gorgeous. One sip of the broth and we both swooned. The Paitan broth is incredibly savory and creamy, the texture like a mix of soup and gravy. The Ramen comes with both duck and pork chashu (1 slice of each in the regular Ramen and two slices of each in the double). The duck chashu was an interesting addition. As my friend commented, you could definitely taste the lemon. To me, it felt a little out of place in the creamy broth, but whatever floats your boat. The PORK chashu though. Omigod. I'm already a sucker for pork, so this absolutely stole my heart. \n\nAbout a third of the way through the meal, however, I could definitely feel some regret. It was sooo rich, maybe a little too rich for my personal taste. I think if I had to do it over, I'd personally try one of the lighter broths but hey- maybe you'll like it more!\n\nOverall, really delicious Ramen and a place I'd definitely recommend trying.

I say this as an extreme skeptic and someone who walked many nights past the 40-50 person crowd, laughing about the line of sheep (sorry).  Little did I know what I was missing out on, and I soon converted... When I finally tried, the first spoonful was just an explosion of umami on my tongue. One taste, and I was hooked.  Also, my little recommendation is to arrive at around 4:15.  Check if there are approximately less than 20 people ahead of you in line (The restaurant seats about 25 at a time- someone can correct me if i'm wrong).  This will ensure you get in on the first batch of customers when it opens at 5pm.  If you're not in the first ~20 waiting in line, then expect an extra 45 minutes beyond that, which crosses the line of how long I personally wait for food.  One annoying thing that happens is that people hold spots for their friends, and this can often be the difference between your 45 min or 1.5 hour wait.  This is frustrating but understandable, so I started double checking with people in front of me whether or not they were holding spots.  Bottom line - must try!

(Have yet to try Iza Ramen though) Went with a ramen connoisseur friend who ranked this place in his top 2 ramen places in all of California.\n\nFOOD:\nWe ordered two classic Tori Paitan Ramen's with double chashu, one with the miso egg and another with the soy egg. The broth is thick, flavorful, full of umami, but *not too salty* (!). For me, the broth is the most important part. I don't think I've ever had a thick broth ramen where I could drink the soup without a bowl of rice. The duck and chashu were cooked exquisitely, and the noodles were thick and yummy. The eggs were both tasty and cooked to runny perfection; I preferred the miso egg (sweeter) to the soy egg (more fermented flavor). You can't order a side of rice here, and I'm not a huge eater, but the double chashu + whole egg was the perfect amount of food for me (maybe sliiiightly too much, but no regerts). My friend who can eat more than me finished all his food and the broth, whereas I wasn't able to finish the broth. We almost ordered one Maccha Ramen instead, but looking at others, the amount of matcha they add was a lot and we overheard people discussing the graininess of it, so decided to stick to the classic for a first time.\n\nSERVICE etc.:\nWe waited in line for ~one hour on Sunday at 6pm for two people. Waiters were all very nice and responsive. They forgot our double chashu and were a little quick to blame us for not ordering correctly rather than taking the blame for not taking down our orders correctly in the first place (we made sure to double check that it was double chashu when ordering). There are baskets under the table for your things, and coat hooks by the door. Decor was slick and urban -- big glass windows, communal wood tables, stool seating -- but still somewhat cozy because of the small space. If you're on a date, get ready to sit across from the other person, because they won't let you sit side by side (the table width is pretty wide). We were lucky enough to be able to trade with another couple to sit side by side. (Personally, I prefer this because I don't like to watch people eat, you're closer to the other person, and it makes sharing food easier, but I understand why they make this rule since there's high customer turnover.) Bathrooms were clean, which is a good sign to me of the level of kitchen cleanliness.\n\nWe will definitely be coming back!

They missed an order for us and at the end, spilled soup all over my pants (a result of them trying to fit too many people in such a tiny space, and inattentiveness of the waitresses) and barely apologized. \n\nUnfortunately for the kitchen, their carefully crafted noodles are matched with a sub-par front house.", "author": "Vivien S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-16", "description": "Arrived at 4:15pm on 2/14 with my girlfriend and we found ourselves at the 30+ mark in line. We decided to wait despite the fact that they had run out of the noodles for the Shio and Shoyu ramen. I even went across the street to get Hot Cheetos because I was so hungry. We entered the restaurant around 5:50 or so and sat at the \"bar\" which is really just 4 chairs looking into the kitchen. Given that our only options were the Tori Paitan, which is written about very favorably here, and the vegan ramen due to the limited menu during Mensho's early operations, we both went with the Paitan.\n\nWhen the reviews say the Paitan is really creamy, they mean it. It is almost too overwhelming with meat flavor and we could not even finish our whole bowl because we got a bit grossed out. It was just a lot of the same flavor. If you've never had Paitan, think Tonkotsu, but WAY creamier. \n\nI could tell that the ramen was really high quality, which is why I am giving 4 stars and perhaps if I would've tried the Shoyu or Shio, I would give 5 stars. I've had ramen at the best places in New York (Ippudo, Totto) so I have some idea of what good ramen should taste like. There's just no way I see myself waiting that long again for ramen, especially in San Francisco, where there must be a dozen places to get at least a decent bowl without the hassle of waiting. \n\nFor Mensho: You guys need to start recording people's cell phone numbers and texting them when their table is ready. There are two bars across the street I would have much rather sat at for 90 minutes. Also, the servers seemed confused about which seats they were covering, as I ordered with 3 different servers. I'm sure this kink will be worked out as the weeks go by, however. \n\nTL;DR - if the wait is over 1 hour, go somewhere else, especially in the first few months of the restaurant being open. They told me they are expanding the menu in the next 2 months. The ramen is really good but not worth the wait and countless people walking and driving by thinking you're crazy", "author": "Adam G."}

I'll be coming back again.\n\nFood\nFirst, the Tori Paitan Ramen, with double chasu.  The broth was incredibly thick, almost gravy like!  An immense amount of flavor in each spoonful and incredibly satisfying in both flavor and fullness.  Both the duck and the pork chashu melt in the mouth; the slow cooking of the meats allows the flavor to concentrate it and it stands out despite the incredibly flavorful broth.  The noodles themselves are thick and take on the flavors of the other ingredients, all while having a firm but easy to eat consistency.\n\nSecond, the Shio Ramen.  Being a shio ramen, the broth is much lighter, but with a much more intense salty flavor.  The initial taste of the soup can definitely taste a bit *too* salty, but it quickly passes by eating more.  The noodles here are much thinner, but it definitely compliments the lighter but more flavorful soup.  The chashu is once again fantastic, and the flavors of the meat stands out in the broth.\n\nThe other vegetables were incredibly fresh, which really adds to the complexity to the overall dish.  It's incredible how they packed so many different flavors into a single dish!  And as a personal preference, I hate when food gets cold too quickly, but the choice of dishware and freshness of the food kept everything hot!\n\nEnvironment\nIt's very intimate seating, so bring a party or a friend!  The food is the main attraction of the restaurant, not the decor! Clean, average loudness, and the service was fantastic.\n\nIn short, if you like ramen, you'll love Mensho Tokyo!", "author": "Chen L."}

Now I know you're going to order the tori paitan ramen which is their deservedly famous meaty dish with a chicken-ish broth, but let me also encourage you to order a couple other things:\n- The vegan tantamen, which the chef recommended as his second choice, and which is an awesome, slightly nutty contrast with the tori paitan.  In fact, we kept alternating between the two because each one seemed to make the other one taste awesomer and each was awesome by itself.\n- The oysters!  These had \"shiyo oil\" on them, which gave me flashback to the first time I had truffle oil: the first bite is a bit \"unusual\" or foreign, the second bite affirms that this foreign taste is actually good and fits in with other savory aromatic foods, and by the third bite you are ready to pay double the price just to have a little more.  Don't tell anyone but I actually licked the oil off the mini plate after the oysters were gone.  \n- The Sansho beer, which is perhaps my favorite \"herbal\" beer ever - with a hint of Japanese peppercorn.  Disclosure: this beer is expensive as f*ck at over $1 per ounce.  Splurge and get two.\n\nOut of curiosity we also ordered the $14 Shiyo ramen, which is listed on the receipt as \"organic ramen.\"  OK to be honest, actually I wrote down \"shiyo\" based on phonetics but now that I look at their menu online, they have $14 \"organic shoyu ramen\" and $9 \"shio ramen\" so I'm not totally sure what we ordered.

There is no sheet to sign in so be prepared to stand in line for at least 45 min. before getting seated. They also don't take reservations. I had the Tori ramen and it was good, but I wasn't that excited about the creamy broth or the kale that came along with the broth. The noodles were firm and the broth was flavorful. The chashu was as expected and the duck chashu was a little fatty. I think I'll stick to the clear broth next time. Unfortunately, there was no egg with the ramen considering it's $16 a bowl of ramen. :( The ramen shop has 3-4 tables with limited seating and it can get pretty loud.

We wandered over Saturday night around 10ish - and were surprised that the line wasn't very long (probably around 20 minute wait). The noodles were very fresh-tasting and chewy. The broth (we ordered the tori paitan and the vegan) was thick and creamy. Tori paitan tasted full and meaty (even porky tasting) and vegan was very nutty with some spicy kick. \n\nQualms are that the broth is a bit too over-the-top creamy (more of a noodly chowder than a ramen) and there's no egg option. Oh man an egg would have been awesome. Also, maybe I should get the shoyu (clear broth) option instead next time.\n\nTo be quite honest, I really enjoyed the meal but don't see myself coming back often. The wait in line isn't worth it to me and $18/bowl of ramen (I think our bill for two ramens and a tea was around $40) is a bit ludicrous, even for San Francisco.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-28", "description": "I had the tori paiton ramen with double chashu and the oyster side dish. They are only using their grand opening menu which consists of 4 types of ramen and some oyster side dish 3/1 when the head chef comes back to San Francisco to expand the menu. This restaurant is showcasing their tori paiton ramen since there are not many other places that are good at making it. \n\nOyster side dish:\nVery worth. $5 for 4 cooked oysters in their special sauce. It's very difficult to describe the taste, but I loved it. One dish is enough for one person as the oysters are pretty small.\n\nSoup - 3/5 (or 5/5 taking into account that it is chicken based)\nI thought for a chicken based stock, the soup was incredibly flavorful. However, when comparing to other pork based broths that I have, it was lackluster. It was very thick and gave a bit of that powdery feeling in your mouth after eating a spoonful. That didn't stop me from spooning up the last of the soup, though. \n\nNoodles - 4/5\nPretty standard noodles for a high end/popular ramen restaurant. They're above average compared to the generic ramen place, but nothing game changing. I think they're a bit on harder side, which is my preference for ramen dishes.\n\nToppings - 4/5\nThis is where I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe it is this style of ramen traditionally doesn't have an egg, but I was pretty disappointed when I found out no soft boiled egg was included in the ramen. However, the duck chashu was the best chashu I've ever had. The texture of the duck was like a rare steak without the blood and iron-y taste. I could eat just that chashu for days, which is why I'm giving the toppings a 4/5. They also had what I think was kale and cabbage in the ramen which provided a nice break from the heavy and salty flavors of everything else.\n\nThe two hour wait for this place was pretty absurd and I'm sure it's just because of the current hype. The first time you go might be worth the wait, but after that, most definitely not. I'll be back to try their tsukemen when they start serving it.", "author": "Michael D."}

The soup is thick and favorable, noodles are thicker than most ramen places, they put kale in there (a plus for me!) and some other veggies. Unfortunately they don't come with the half boiled egg.

The line wasn't terribly long - but there was still about a 30 minute wait. Pro tip: If you're willing to dine alone, you can get a seat pretty quickly (I've noticed within 5-10 minutes tops). \n\nThe Venue - 4/5\nDefinitely small, and communal. There aren't any individual tables, rather, you'll end up at a communal table that seats about 6 guests. I noticed that most people kept to themselves/the people they came with - but some people (generally the individual diners) would have a great conversation with the complete strangers that they sat next to. There isn't much wiggle room, but there's enough to not bump elbows with your neighbor. They provide a little basket under each pair of seats, meant for putting any belongings (bags/jackets etc) during your dining experience. The servers and staff seemed friendly, although when ordering, I felt that we were slightly rushed. \n\nThe Food - 3/5\nI wasn't a huge fan of the food. The ramen noodles seemed slightly undercooked (and different bowls had different types). I ended up with the Tori Paitan, but for me it wasn't \"blow me out of the water\" amazing. The broth was decent, definitely different, but didn't shock me (I didn't end up finishing all the soup). I felt that it was a little too rich for my tastes, so maybe next time I'll try a different one. The meat was so-so: I didn't enjoy the regular pork chasau (it had a wine or alcoholic taste to it that didn't quite sit right with me), but I LOVED the duck chasau. For my companion, it was the opposite, he loved the pork and hated the duck. The one thing that made me really sad was the lack of soft-boiled egg. For me, I love ramen for the soft-boiled egg, and was sad to see that they didn't have it :[ I also think that the variety of the menu was a little disappointing. I would like to see additional add on options, such as extra corn, extra broth, etc. Currently, they only have add extra types of chasau.\n\nOverall - 3/5\nI think this was definitely a place to try once, for the experience. Perhaps it's my particular taste preference, but I didn't love the ramen. It's very  bare minimum and focuses more on the particular broths. I would say try it to see if you like it, but I think it's more of a taste preference type of place. I would love to see more explanation of the different menu items (since they didn't really explain much), and more options for additional add-ons. I think this place definitely has potential, but still needs to work out the kinks before they get a higher rating for me. I'll probably try this place again in a few months or so, to see if they've improved.", "author": "Li S."}

This place is made for baka gaijin. $16 Tori Paitan Ramen with super stingy toppings and super small portion noodles which I finished in less than 3mins, faster than it takes to make instant noodles. $11.75 for Sansho \"highway robbery\" beer. My total comes to $31.90 or $32 for noodles that are nothing special, especially for those who comes from East Asian countries. The owner must be laughing all the way to the bank. Ingredients cost $5 at most and was charged $32USD for a bowl of noodles and beer. Only the dumbest people buy into the ramen hype. This stuff is fast food in Japan and all over Asia, it's nothing special but somehow there's a ramen craze in the West and fast food chefs from East Asia are flocking over here like it's a gold rush to capitalize on the craze. I feel like the biggest sucker for playing $32 for something that easily passes for $10 tops. Ramen Yamadaya is still the best in SF, Ramen Dojo/Ramen Parlor (same owner) if you're in San Mateo.

Being from Socal, I've had a lot of ramen in my lifetime (from Gardena/Torrance, Downtown Little Tokyo, to Costa Mesa). It took my 3rd attempt in line to finally get into this place (the first two times I was too hungry for a 1.5hr wait). Needless to say, I was extremely happy to have gotten a seat after only an hour wait (I also had a smaller meal prior to coming here). I got the vegan ramen. For $18, it's definitely on the HIGH end of the menu (well, not even that, high by any ramen standard). The soup base flavoring was really good the first 3 spoonfuls, but the saltiness quickly became overwhelming. The noodle itself was thick (I think it depends on preference, but I prefer the thinner more springy noodles). They include tip into your bill at 15% so I think the service can slack a bit because we were nearly done with our ramen when they remembered our marinated oyster order. We could have easily skipped it.  It looked nothing like other Yelp reviewers' photos. It was definitely overlooked. Not sure it's worth the wait, but given the novelty of the restaurant and the high ratings, you'd have to try it just for curiosity's sake.

More to do with the way this business is run and how food is wasted at this restaurant that is in the Tenderloin neighborhood of SF. I have posted my email thread with the manager of the restaurant who never addressed my concerns with the establishment. In fact, he mansplained about ramen. Dine at Mensho at your own risk. Just know YOU HAVE to order food there (even if you're just dining out with friends and might want to share food) and YOU CAN NOT take any food to go even if you're purchasing it. Enjoy. \n\nGood afternoon,\n\nI am writing to let you know that my boyfriend and I had a bad experience at your San Francisco-based restaurant last night. After patiently waiting in line for 30 minutes (which I have done before at your establishment), we were told after being seated that my boyfriend had to order food even though he had ordered a beer and I ordered an appetizer and a bowl of ramen. Since he knew I was hungry (but he was not), he graciously ordered another bowl of ramen for himself.  When we were done with our ramen, we asked to get my boyfriend's bowl of ramen to go, but we were told he couldn't take it home even though we were forced to order a second bowl. The second bowl of ramen, which I paid for, was wasted. \n\nBeing a resident of San Francisco for 10 years, I know that owning a business in this city is expensive, but not being able to take a meal home that I paid for is ridiculous. My boyfriend and I are very cost-conscience, so paying $11 for a bowl of ramen and not being able to enjoy it later is a waste of your ingredients and time as well as our money.\n\nI was incredibly disappointed by what happened at your restaurant and will never go back again. At the very least, let your customers take home what they don't finish since they are paying for it. Your food is going to waste in a city that has a lot of homeless individuals as well as people who are just trying to survive here. \n\n\nDear ------,\n\nI am very sorry to hear about your negative experience at Mensho Tokyo SF.  It is our goal and purpose at Mensho to serve authentic Japanese ramen.  Ramen is based on the balance and harmony of five main elements, and is meant to be enjoyed immediately upon being prepared by the chef.  To let the ramen sit or take it away would allow the noodles to soften, the soup and fat to separate, and in essence would ruin the magical harmony which is what makes ramen great.  In Japan there is no ramen take-out and no to-go, period.  We strive to create this authentic experience and it is why we have our current policies.  I want to sincerely apologize for our lack of communicating this to you before you patronized our restaurant.  I agree that wasting food is a terrible thing, and better communication on our end can hopefully help us avoid this situation in the future.  I apologize once again, and hope you can understand.\n\nSincerely,\nAbram Plaut\n\nMensho Tokyo", "author": "Erin L."}

The tori paitan was a really creamy, heavy broth.. perhaps, a bit too heavy for my liking. It also had a duck flavor to it, which wasn't my favorite. The shoyu ramen, on the other hand, was great. Loved the lighter taste. Plus, it was just the right amount of seasoning. For both bowls of ramen, the noodle was pretty good and actually kind of reminded me of Chinese noodles a little. The chasu was on point -\u00a0pretty much melted in your mouth.\n\nAs for service, everyone was friendly and great. Pretty quick about getting the ramen out as well. Kudos and shoutout to the host, who was really friendly and cared about our dining experience.\n\nI look forward to their full menu and would love to try their tonkotsu ramen. Until next time, Mensho!\n\n(10/100)", "author": "Cassy H."}

The name of the game is thick, THICK, rich broth if you get the classic Tori Paitan. It's by far richer than Totto's, which kind of overdid it for me personally, but there's no denying that the ramen is still delicious. Just be warned that this is a very rich meal, and trying to drink all the broth along with your noodles is more ambitious than your average bowl of soup. \n\nMy boyfriend has been here before when this place first opened, and he commented on how the slices of duck always seem raw and undercooked. This time, they were also a noticeably pink color, but we figured it was on purpose. Neither of us came down with any illnesses except the sheer distension of our very full stomachs afterwards.", "author": "Hope X."}

I expect the wait for Fridays and weekends to be much longer, but I swear it is worth it. \n\nInside: Mensho is a super small ramen shop, with a simple, clean cut themed interior design. Everything looked super clean and new. All white everything. \n\nStaff: Service was not extraordinary, but its more or less like a service you get at most authentic asian restaurants. The staff's priority is to get the line rolling but rotating people in an out as fast as possible. \n\nThe Ramen: WAS UNBELIEVABLY AMAZING.\n\n I ordered the Tori Paitan, which was $16, a bit on the pricey end that I am used to paying for ramen. As soon as I took a sip of the broth, I couldn't help but smile. I was absolutely stunned by the richness and intense flavor of the ramen. \n\nIt came with 2 small slivers of duck chashu and 1 ginormous sliver of pork chashu. The duck chashu was seasoned perfectly and tasted unique but delicious. The pork chashu was a bit fatty, but still flavorful. There was also a small bushel of kale and bamboo shoots. The noodles were thicker than most ramen shops I have been too (which I personally prefer) and had a little bounce to them. It was the perfect combination of chewiness and tenderness- perfect for slurping. Best of all was the broth- it was creamy, rich but not too heavy, and EXTREMELY flavorful. It tasted as if a chicken was used to make the first batch of broth, which was then boiled again with a fresh new chicken, but 10 times. Everything in the bowl came together perfectly. Although the portions may seem a bit small, the richness of the broth will make up for it. By the time I finished 3/4 of the ramen, the broth was getting a little bit overwhelming, but nevertheless I could not stop until I finished every last noodle in the bowl. So if you are worried that this bowl of ramen won't fill you, I promise that you will be A-OK. \n\nIf you are looking to get your mind blown by a bowl of ramen, Mensho is the closest you will get to authentic Japanese ramen in the city.\n\nJUST DO IT.

Oh no, I've done [insert name of any place vaguely hipsterish in The Mission] the hard way. And probably complained about it, except on the rare occasion I thought it really worth the wait...\n\nStep forward Mensho. Or rather, step forward imperceptibly slowly along a somewhat gritty stretch of Geary. I couldn't get Google Maps Popular Times to work for this place - probably because it's so new - but my suspicion is the chart would be solid blue lines i.e. constantly busy. Fortunately my friend lives right across the street and has been carefully monitoring the line on an almost constant basis. She should really set up a pay-per-view MenshoCam (TM) that integrates seamlessly with the Eater app. That'd help fund the $18 ramen addiction.\n\nUtilizing our insider knowledge of line dynamics we seized our opportunity and the wait - thankfully - was only around 35-40 minutes. The weather wasn't terrible and we even made new acquaintances and exchanged ramen recos as we inched toward our supper. The space itself is tiny yet minimalist chic and, given the hype combined with limited capacity, it's easy to understand the long lines. The confusing thing was that the menu written on the wall doesn't correspond to what they actually sell so best not to pay attention to that.\n\nMy go-to in most noodle shops is the Tonkotsu Ramen which unfortunately Mensho doesn't yet offer, apparently they're still in the process of setting up the necessary equipment. Instead I went with the Tori Paitan, a recommendation from our line buddy, which was decent but not really my cup of soup. I kind of regretted not going with the Shoyu Ramen.\n\nOverall I liked the experience and didn't so much mind the wait but can only really give 3 stars based on the food, which admittedly was largely down to my own rash selection. I'd like to come back and try the Shoyu Ramen, or ideally the Tonkotsu once they finally have that available, and will rate again. The only thing I would say is that there was no hot sauce or hot pepper available, and frankly I like a bit of heat in my ramen - I get that this is a purist type of place though. If you like that you might want to bring your own. Just saying.\n\nAs to whether it was worth the wait, I'd say yes in this case as a new experience but wouldn't want to wait close to 1 hour even once the menu is updated. I did try to come back a few weeks after my initial visit but the line was much longer than before so ended up elsewhere. I'm sure many devotees will continue to endure the long waits but, for those who love the ramen places down there, you'd probably be eating sooner if you drove all the way to Santa Clara.

I liked the think ramen noodle in tantanmen and the way it is cooked but it's too salty for my taste. the clam butter uses a thinner and flatter noodle, which works well with the lighter and clearer soup. the clam and scallop are both fresh and tasty, the lemon slice helps by giving it a fresher taste and also adds variation to the bowl. We are happy with the enoki chips. I had enoki tempura before but these are different. They don't seem to be using any flour batter  (at least I didn't taste any in our batch), which makes it very flaky and less greasy than enoki tempura. Definitely give it a try if you like enoki like we do.\n\nOverall we enjoyed the food quite a lot. But we probably won't be back when the line is long. The food is good but not worth an hour of wait. \n\nI do think the restaurant could serve their customers better with some lining policies\n\nWe went there on a friday evening around 5:50. There were about 28 ppl in front of us. There are also about 28 seats in the restaurant so we decided to stay. After 15 minutes, we didn't move forward too much, mostly because ppl lining in front of us had friends joining them - one person even had 5 people joining him! I would like to think restaurants line their customers up not just to give themselves good advertisement but also to help people decide if they are dining there based on the length of the line. Allowing too many people to cut into the line because they have sent a friend waiting does a disservice for that purpose. If the restaurant lets people line up before the whole group is there, It is better to also keep a written waiting list of names with the number in each party, so that people would not have the wrong expectation regarding the waiting time. \n\nI also noticed that mensho does not seem to seat smaller groups first. They left 4 empty seats open for sometime until 2 more people at that table left so that they can accommodate the 6-ppl group. To be honest, that's a nice thing for the restaurant to do, and I would prefer going to that kind of restaurant when I have a larger party.

But there's something wrong when potential customers are leaving frustrated and hungry after waiting in line for an hour and not having move at all (not even an exaggeration). How my girlfriend and I managed is beyond me. You guys must enjoy the free advertisement from having people see other people wait in a line for your food, especially in that part of town. Don't worry! They have no name list and they don't have reservations, and they are not friendly to groups bigger than 3/4 people! So you can slave away and wait in a line for 2 hours to try something that I sincerely believe does not cost $18 a bowl. Ramen isn't supposed to be this expensive. \n\nI got the Tori Paitan with extra meat for $18. It was OK. Just OK.\n\nAll in all, was it worth the wait? No.\nWas it worth the price? No.\nWas it worth the experience of waiting in line for 2 hours in anticipation for the \"best\" ramen in SF?

I was curious to try this place out based on the reviews and demand. \n\nWe waited for about 30 minutes in line and got seats at the bench. I ordered the vegan option and got a side of kale. Normally I like to add eggs to my ramen but that option wasn't available. The ramen was tasty thanks especially to the creamier broth, though it was missing several of the vegetables I normally get. The service wasn't great and you could tell that some of the servers have developed an attitude given the popularity of the restaurant. Also, as expected, the ramen was pricey. We had one of the more expensive beers which was a nice addition. \n\nAlthough interesting, this ramen wasn't worth the wait, price, or attitude-y service.

Do I get to pay less since you are throwing away some of my food? So that made me upset, but then they refused to split our bill.

There was (of course) already a line outside (presumably before they even opened). We waited around 45 minutes before being seated (party of 4), which was actually a lot faster than we expected. My boyfriend originally wanted to order Tonkotsu Ramen as it was one of the dish written on the wall, but apparently they're still doing a limited opening and Tonkotsu wasn't one of the dish we can order. We all opted to then get the Tori Paitan, which was what they're famous for. IMO the Tori Paitan is even more rich than Tonkotsu (it's basically a white thick chicken broth). So if you're not really into rich broth, opt for the Shoyu or Shio ramen (Shoyu, imo, is less rich compared to Shio). It was super delicious, comes with both duck and pork chashu (my boyfriend opted to get double chashu), and the noodle is pretty thick with a nice chewiness. One thing I hope they will add in the future would be an option for extra noodle. Is it the best ramen place in the bay? I personally still like Orenchi and Ramen Dojo/Parlor better, but it's definitely in the top 5 (especially if the wait isn't as long and they have a more extensive menu).

The noodles have just the right level of firmness and springy quality, the chashu slices and duck slices are also cooked perfectly so the meat is melt-in-your mouth tender, each vegetable is the right texture. If you need more spice, you can ask the wait staff for chili sauce or shichimi powder. You can also order extra meat, extra egg, extra vegetables etc., for extra $. The oysters are not worth ordering in my opinion. They are tiny and hard and covered in a sweet sauce and taste like the kind of oysters you get out of a Chinese can.

So for those of you thinking about it; just wait until the hype dies down and they've worked out the kinks. \n\nFor two of us (we needed to make it worth our while to wait):\n\n1.) tori paitan:  this was pretty tasty. Rich, without being too heavy. Garlic was yummy, but not overpowering. The pork and duck chasu were really good; not sure I would pay $2 or $1.50 for an small extra slice of either though. I liked the noodles in this one better than the other two.  I do think that overall, these aren't the best ramen noodles I've ever had. I like mine with more bite/chew to them. These noodles were maybe 1-2 mins too long. Also, towards the middle to the end of the bowl, I got a lot of residue/grit/something. I think they need to strain the broth a few more times to get rid of that stuff. It was a bad way to end the bowl. \n\n2.) shoyu: this was my favorite bowl of the three. It had a nice subtle sweetness and was flavorful. The soup gave my mouth a nice coat, but it wasn't fatty or greasy. But, as mentioned above, I didn't love the actual ramen noodles. Too soggy and they were different than the tori paitan noodles and not springy at all. \n\n3.) shio:  this was was also nice. Good, clean flavor. I like the garlic in this, also. I probably won't remember this one in a month. \n\n4.) oysters:  pass. I've had better smoked ones from Whole Foods. \n\nService was good; they are trying really hard. \n\nI think they need to construct the table to be more stabilized. Every time some sat down and leaned on the table, it would knock the other end of the table. Could be hazardous with molten bowls of porky soup. \n\nThe lines for this place tells me that SF is in dire need for some great, not good ramen.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-05", "description": "I was truly excited as I waited in line to try the ramen here, and got here with my friend a full 45 minutes to wait before the restaurant opened (we were not even the first party to arrive!). Luckily, we made the first seating though! \n\nFood: My rating for this place ultimately comes down to the food. I ordered the Tori Paitan ramen with double chashu. Long story short, I was just not impressed and this type of ramen is just not to my liking. The broth, while very flavorful, had an overly rich taste and was just a bit too salty to be enjoyable. It was also very opaque, so you couldn't quite see what else was in your bowl without having to fish around in it. The noodles though were actually tasty, and had a nice texture and bite...slightly reminiscent of an udon noodle, but not as thick. Overall, too much for me to handle after more than just a few bites. I was actually sad that they do not have to go boxes since this was way too much for me to handle in one sitting. \n\nService: The people here are welcoming and friendly, especially since the location is quite small. I never found it difficult to let someone know if I needed anything like a water refill or the bill. The one issue that my party had was communicating with some of the people here when we had questions. I had a difficult time understanding them, so at some points I just nodded my head in agreement. \n\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is tiny on the inside and seating is done on communal tables (so you might not know who is across or to the left or right of you). I didn't mind so it was not too much of an issue. I do wish that there were other seating options besides stools, especially after waiting outside for so long. It would have been nice to have some back support to make the dining experience more comfortable (though I do understand the stools for aesthetic purposes). There are also baskets under each table for you to store your things, which are convenient too. This location also has just one bathroom, which had an unusual odor to it, but since it's located so close to the dining and kitchen area, there was not an opportunity to properly air it out. Better ventilation in the dining room would have also been appreciated because the aroma of the rich flavored food was a bit intense at times. \n\nIf the hype ever dies down, I might come back here and try another noodle option, but based on my first experience I am in certainly no rush. I wish they took to-go orders (or at least a boxing option), but perhaps that's an area they can get into once their business starts to grow. I would also like to see them adopt a sign in system either manually or through an app instead of just having people wait in a long line. This would give people some mobility instead of having to wait outside until room clears up for dining.", "author": "Daniel H."}

It was salty to the point where it muted and underwhelmed all the other flavors in the bowl. I really appreciated the service and portion sizes and liked the ambiance. The service was amazing! Waiters were attentive and accommodating for large parties! However $200 for 7 bowls of ramen and a couple of beers and three oyster appetizers, is not bad.

They brought the check at once, and literally three different waiters came by to check if we had put our credit cards down, where I had to point out to one that my friend was still eating.

I was a little hesitant from some yelp reviews that said it was over priced or over hyped, but so glad we stuck it out and tried it. The first night around 6pm was a Friday and we waited about an hour, but we knew ahead of time based on reviews we would. Seating is a little awkward maybe depending on who your neighbor's are since you sit across from the person you are dinning with, but the food is totally worth it. My boyfriend and I came back on a Sunday around 10pm, got right in no wait, and sat at the little bar area facing the cooks. We loved it and enjoyed the atmosphere a little bit more than the first night since we could be closer. I got a double the second time and it was delicious once again. I thought the quality and amount of food was perfect for the price and the ramen noodles were perfect and broth soooo tasty.

Simple and clean design with cool lighting. \n\nThe Food: The Tori Paitan was incredibly rich, with thicker noodles. The chashu literally melts in your mouth, and combined with the creamy broth delivered a monster umami punch. The broth itself definitely rivals most tonkotsu's I've had in terms of richness. The fact that it was so robust without being very oily was a huge plus too. The chashu is literally the best I've ever had, and I'm definitely adding a few extra pieces next time I go.

However, it is worth trying.You eat at a community table and they seat you were they can fit you. Don't expect to have privacy and to have a sit down where you can eat, have an intimate convo and take your jolly time. When you're done you gosta go. The portion is good, service is good and food is good. Glad I tried it, but not going again anytime soon unless there's not wait.", "author": "melinda v."}

It opened just a few weeks ago, and there are always super long lines in front of the restaurant. I live only a block away so I stood in line 45 minutes before they opened. I was still the 10th person in line...crazy! It was well worth the wait however. The ramen is definitely the best ramen in the city. I ordered the Tori Paitan ramen with double chashu. This is definitely the way to go...order the double chashu!!! The broth is creamier than other ramen places I've tried; the waiters told me it was because it is slow cooked in pork bone (yummy!!!). It is a bit pricier compared to other ramen places in the city. The Tori Paitan with double chashu costs $18 and a normal Tori Paitan is $16. I would pay the additional $2 for the double chashu; it's worth it. I like that they added a vegan option for the vegans/vegetarians in the Bay Area. I came here with my friend whos vegetarian and she got to enjoy the amazing ramen as well. All in all, a great experience at a new gem in the city.", "author": "Rebecca D."}

Apparently upon opening, there was always a 1+ hour wait. The restaurant only fits ~30, so definitely not a place for larger parties. We came here on a Sunday evening at around 7 PM and the wait was ~45 minutes for a party of 6. All the broths they currently offer are chicken based for now. They're planning to come out with a tonkatsu one and start making their own noodles soon. I had the spicy dry ramen with the habaneros on the side. The orange pickled habaneros were so delicious! Beware if your spicy threshold is not high b/c it'll definitely leave you gasping for air. Overall, I think the ingredients are very high quality and the ramen is tasty. However, the cons are $18 for a very small portion (they do not allow to-go boxes -_-) and extremely salty!", "author": "Chinh T."}

I was super excited to try this place as i'm searching for a new favorite ramen spot.  Of course I had to order the Tori Paitan Ramen.  At first glance at my bowl it looked a bit empty. A few strands of veggies here and there.  I took a sip of the soup and it was good. It was just good. The duck chasu on the otherhand was delicious. I was curious to try out whatever was in the little pots on the table. Those seasonings gave the broth a deeper flavor, but I did not want to ruin the natural flavors of the broth. I absolutely loved the noodles, chewy and delicious! just the way I like it.  I finished all of my broth, because I know how hard they work to achieve that consistency and flavor.

I'm not a ramen connoisseur but it was extremely good and flavorful. For drinks, we got 2 Sopporros ($4.75/bottle). For our ramen, we both got the Tori Paitan. A double basically has 2 pieces of pork ($18) and the regular only has 1 piece of pork ($16). Since I'm not a duck person, I replaced my duck with an extra piece of pork. The broth was definitely think and creamy. The pork was delicious and my BF said the duck melted in his mouth. My BF is VERY picky and he even said it was the best ramen he's had and he usually doesn't say that about restaurants often. The noodles were sooooo good!!! We got lucky because our wait to get inside was no more than 15-20 minutes. People in line were saying that it was the shortest it's ever been and usually is a minimum of an hour wait. I guess we got lucky. From waiting in line to paying our bill, I'd say we were in and out in about 1 hour and 15 minutes.", "author": "Cheryl V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-24", "description": "So, I thought I updated this review after my second trip there, but I guess not. now, I am not impressed. The first time I had something that wasn't on the menu when I came back about a month later, so I tried the tori paitan which seems to be their main thing. It is just too damn rich for my taste. Kinda of like a lard smoothie. The stuff I said about the place in the review that follows is still true, but the part about it being too much for me is emphasized massively. I can't even think about going back there without shuddering. \nOld review: So I am giving the place 5 because they do a really good job at what they do even though it isn't my new favorite ramen place. \nSo, I sat a the \"bar\", four seats, 3 lefties? Solo, male, left-handed, \"sit here so you can crowd each other and not knock elbows with the righties\". The good thing was that I got to watch the \"ramen magic\" happen. For someone who spent many years working in restaurants, and had way too many opportunities too watch people cook, as well as the ongoing dreams of people cooking in slow motion, got to admit I still love to watch. Wow, are those chunks of lard they are adding? I guess so, that is pretty much what paitan is, tasty liquid lard. Slightly disconcerting, but then why boil those pig ankles for hours if not to extract delicious components. And, it is delicious, can't speak for the paitan since I had spicy miso ramen, but it was certainly delicious. Maybe a little too \"kotteri\" for my taste.\nI used to get a magazine called \"Lucky Peach\", not sure if it still exists, but it was kind of interesting. The first issue was all about ramen, and they included some recipes (which had some major mistakes, still want to spit thinking about the alkali soap noodles I made). This cat Chang, I think his name is, has some hot ramen place in NYC, and was \"sharing\" his secrets, or trying to poison the unsuspecting. He used Benton bacon instead of katsuobushi, and if you have ever tried this stuff, the bacon I mean, it tastes like it was smoked over truck tires. It is industrial strength. So my point is....\nMensho is kinda an industrial strength ramen, lots of flavor, intense, delicious, perfectly prepared, just not my style. I think the phrase \"it is the Mission Chinese of ramen\" kind of sums it up. Or as an old \"Was, Not Was\" song said...\nLove how hard the kitchen works to prepare a delicious and beautiful bowl.", "author": "James T."}

Maybe cause I'm not into Ramen in general - but like almost twenty dollars for a bowl of Ramen? Really?  I was told the milky sauce would be tasty it was like some kind of icky gravy covering noodles, I'm not sure what kind of thing people are thinking there getting with noodles but you could go home, get some eggs, get some flower, mix em together roll em out, cut em boil em and have noodles and they would not be worse nor probably better than these \"Ramen  is  really just a food that's gotten some popularity in the Asian community in my imagination  because it's something grandma used to make, let me tell you, your grandma made better noodles, you should spend more time visiting her and less time waiting in line.  My grandma made better noodles and she was a Scottish, Irish, German. Take her noodles put on some hot sauce and her noodles would be way better.  The sauce that was poured over the noodles was bland even after a lot, and I do mean a lot of hot sauce.

Good and bad, from 500-1,500 yen ($4.5-$14) I had them all.\n\nFirst, parking is hard in down town 40 mins to find a spot.   2nd the waiting line to this hole in the wall is long and moving slow.   Finally I got in... The music sux and loud.  I was offered a menu but within 30 seconds a rude lady stopped by.  \"What do you want!\"  Really? It was such a warm welcome...\nMe: Tonkotsu please\nshe: not yet! \nMe: not yet about...?\nShe: not yet!  We don't have\nMe: but it is in the menu?\nShe: we don't have it, not yet.\nShe was so rude but since i've wasted so much time and hungry then I ordered whatever chicken broth ramen.  The broth was salty and tons of MSG that made me dizzy.  Noodles were stuck together like just microwaved food.  Overall, this place is over rated and not recommended. \n\nPS Washed my hands before meal but the toilet smell like hell!", "author": "Cookie M."}

I know my ramen and don't make the mistake of referring to one of their styles tonkatsu when it should be tonkotsu FWIW. Their front staff seem as though they all speak Japanese fluently or close to it, so that can be a good sign for a ramen restaurant. But their Shio-Chashu ramen was not what I expected. The amount of katsuobushi (dried fish) in it was so great I doubted whether they gave me the correct dish. It was super-fishy, which isn't what I expect for the broth when it's supposed to be shio (salt). I watched as the cooks were microwaving the noodles in the back. Why? The pork was refrigerated and not only cool, but it was COLD in my ramen. The noodles themselves had very good mouthfeel. But when the soup isn't correct, it's a big problem. I walked by it the night before and I believe the stories of greater than 1 hour wait. I asked the people in line if they had been there before--not a single person had. This may be emblematic for them. I'm glad I went the next day near opening with no line. This is my experience--I'm sure lots of other people had radically different experiences, but to say I was underwhelmed would be an understatement and I ended up not eating more than half of it.

When I asked to take the rest of my order home the server said it wasn't allowed because the chef said \"the taste won't be the same.\" Her attitude was impersonal and dismissive. Mensho is obviously popular and will do business whether or not I return, but this experience made me feel wasteful and undervalued, especially with the location being in an underprivileged neighborhood. At $18 a bowl, Unsure if it merits giving it another try.", "author": "E P."}

It is a bit on the pricey side ($18 for a bowl of ramen) and they don't put the leftovers in a container (because it changes the flavor apparently) so be prepared to finish the huge bowl. About an hour wait time as well. But still worth it!", "author": "Basim B."}

Well, a day later we were stuck, during our drive home, on a Saturday afternoon waiting until Monday for the local dealer ship to open so we could have the water pump replaced. When I arrived I asked them to also find out about the new noise and the answer was: 'It's your water pump\" --- too bad this dealership doesn't train their people better.", "author": "Pete L."}

The tori paiten dashi was umami on steroids, appropriately rich and flavorful. The shio dashi was clean, with a perfect proportion of fat, and delicate noodles that were both toothsome and tender. I look forward to the menu expansion and monthly specials to come. Congratulations!!", "author": "Irene T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-02-10", "description": "We were impressed by the Tori Paitan Ramen - it has a very rich, balanced and full bodied flavor with super tender meat. This dish was very unique and having recently traveled to Japan have to say it is different (not spicy, has a thicker broth and no egg), however we were not disappointed and the the overall package was excellent. I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking to experience a unique form of ramen. We are looking forward to visiting more in the coming months when their currently limited menu is expected to expand.", "author": "Christine D."}

Anyways, I got here on a Friday night for a party of 2 and waited a good 45 minutes to an hour, but then again that was expected, so just be prepared.  Inside it was tight, but also something that I expected.  They quickly take your order, as they are trying to get people in and out of the restaurant as quickly as possibly because of the high volume and customers and little room in the place.  Don't worry, there's usually plenty of time to figure out what you want in line.  After that, we got our food, and it was great.  Aside from the fact that their ramen was a little pricey, (almost at the Ramen Shop prices in Oakland) it was still really good and I'd say worth the wait.  I also recently got back from Japan, and had ramen there, and I'd say that this place is definitely competitive.", "author": "Stephanie F."}

We arrived at the restaurant around 4:30, half hour before they opened and we waited for about 2hrs before we got seated.  I thought it was crazy but it was worth it after we tried their ramen.  They only had two kinds of ramen tonight: Tori Paltanf and Vegan Tantanmen.  I appreciate them for trying to make sure everything is as good as it is in Japan and that's why they rather serve only 2 ramens tonight.  We tried both tonight and I love meat but to my surprise, I liked the vegan tantanmen better.  I thoughtful it was very flavorful and complex and the noodles were cooked perfectly with the right texture and chewiness.  The broth was very thick but it wasn't oily at all.  We will definitely come back to try their shio and shoyu ramen.  By the way, the guy at the door, probably the owner and the staff were all very friendly and welcoming.  Good job!", "author": "winnie l."}
