{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-01", "description": "This is one of the most unique and intimate places for French cuisine in San Francisco.  Jeanne D' Arc is the native name for Joan of Arc.  The restaurant is designed like a medieval church with stained glass art, suits of armor, swords, and other d\u00e9cor.  You will find this restaurant at the basement of Hotel Cornell (also French) near Bush and Powell, across the street from Sons and Daughters.  \n\nThe set menu is four-course for $52/pp, with bread, vegetable soup, and your choice of app, main, and dessert. Options for mains had like two lamb dishes, two duck dishes, two seafood options, and like three beef dishes.  Like the knight from Indiana Jones Last Crusade, \"Choose Wisely!\"\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was great, with a violinist playing various tunes like Over the Rainbow.  Food was a bit uneven though - both our meat entrees tended to be a tad bit overcooked and borderline dry, so 3 stars.  Maybe best to stick with seafood and duck dishes.\n\nAppetizers: The Escargots were large, meaty, and soaked with garlic, melted butter, and pesto.  Solid dish.  At first we were a bit concerned the ramekins were overflowing with oily, melted butter.  Just fish the snails out and enjoy!\n\nMains: The rack of lamb was seasoned, very meaty, but a bit too dry considering I asked for medium rare.  I would have liked more juiciness.  This dish came with lamb sausage which was pretty good.  My wife opted for the filet medium rare but that too turned out to be on the dry side, despite having some pick.  We wondered if the meat quality wasn't all that great to begin with.  So a bit of a downer.  However, I must say that they had really good side dishes with tender carrots, crispy asparagus, and very rich and buttery scalloped potatoes. The sauces were also excellent for both dishes, though not enough to make up for the overcooked meat.\n\nDesserts: Get the Souffle for sure - super airy, soft, and a little citrusy from the Gran Marnier.  Definitely low calorie since its mostly air, LOL!  Enjoy with their excellent black coffee.", "author": "Daniel C."}

It was the beginning of their $52 four course menu.  It was a bit lighter in texture than I hoped but generously served and tasty nonetheless.\n\nI opted for the foie gras next.  The serving size was larger than I expected.  The accompanying fig jelly was decadent and I enjoyed combining it with the foie gras and toast points.  Delicious.\n\nCourse three for me were the braised short ribs and spring vegetables.\nA good sized piece of a short rib sat on mashed potatoes with accompanying baby carrots.  All were covered in a savory brown sauce.\n\nI ordered their famous Grand Marnier Souffl\u00e9 for dessert and it was perfection.  Beautiful to look at and beautiful to eat.\n\nWe brought our own wine--\"Crankcase\" from Berghold winery.  Corkage was $20.\n\nThere are rabbit, lamb, and filet mignon options on the menu as well as seafood dishes.\n\nService was excellent.  The restaurant itself is very clean--I noticed their score of 100!\n\nIt's a very special find.  The decor includes hanging tapestries on the walls and copper pots and pans throughout.

When I found out I was going to a late evening event in the area, it gave me the perfect excuse to check them out. I made a same day reservation for our party of two through OpenTable for Thursday, June 28th at 6:45pm.\n\nFour Course Dinner - Prix Fixe $54 x2\n*SOUP - SOUPE MARIGNAN: Ginger Carrot Soup\n*CHOICE OF SECOND COURSES - ESCARGOTS DE BOURGOGNE: Snails Cooked with Garlic & Parsley; FOIE GRAS: Foie Gras with Plum Compote (add $15)\n*CHOICE OF ENTREES - CARR\u00c9 D'AGNEAU DES ALPAGES: Rack of Lamb with a Red Wine & Shallot Sauce (add $6); FILET MIGNON, SAUCE FORESTI\u00c8RE: Filet Mignon with a Mushroom Sauce (add $6); served with PURE\u00c9 DE POMMES DE TERRE: Whipped Yukon Gold Potatoes, ASPERGES: Asparagus, CAROTTES NOUVELETTES: Glazed Baby Carrots\n*CHOICE OF DESSERTS - SOUFFL\u00c9 AU GRAND MARNIER: Orange Liqueur Souffle; TARTELETTE AUX FRAMBOISES ET MYRTILLES: Raspberry & Blueberry Tartlet\n\nWe started off with the carrot soup. I'm not a huge fan of cooked carrots, but this was better than I expected. It was thinner than I thought it would be, so not too creamy. (I tend to prefer brothy soups.) Also, not too sweet which is my issue with cooked carrots. When I asked if the foie was going to be seared or a torchon / terrine, our waiter seemed confused. He just said it was made in house. He ended up saying it was seared which is my favorite version, so I was excited. It ended up being a torchon which was a little disappointing, but totally fine. It was actually a huge portion. Could have used more foie flavor, but still tasty. It came with a complimentary glass of wine which was much appreciated. Acted as a nice palate cleanser. The escargots were good. Just needed a little more salt. I ended up eating half the basket of complimentary bread just so I could sop up all that butter!\n\nFor our mains, I got the filet rare. It was cooked perfectly. And the sides were so comforting. The asparagus was super buttery. The menu said we were getting whipped potatoes, but I think we got GRATIN DAUPHINOIS: Potatoes au Gratin instead. This was fine by me as I don't like really like whipped / mashed potatoes. I didn't try the carrots, but my dining companion enjoyed them. I rarely eat lamb anymore as the roommate has an aversion to it, so I was happy we ordered the rack of lamb. He ordered it medium rare, but for a french place, it came out more medium, which was a little over for me. I still enjoyed eating the meat by the bones though. (Yes, I'm not ashamed of gnawing on a bone like a dog.) Not sure if they have fresh ground pepper as it was never offered, but I was missing this on my soup and entrees.\n\nFor dessert, I had to have the souffle! (This used to be my favorite dessert special at my dad's restaurant.) It was beautiful. Light and fluffy. A little airier than I prefer, but definitely satisfied that craving. The tart was huge. And full of berries. Just a solid simple berry tart. For drinks, we decided on a french wine. The Bordeaux - MARGAUX: Charmes de Kirwan 2010 ($66). All their wines are reasonably priced, so definitely a great deal. With dessert, we got a Harvey's Bristol Cream Sherry ($6) and a Coffee ($2). I wanted a port as well, but they were all out, so we just stuck with our two drinks.\n\nA great old school french restaurant. Definitely my kind of fancy comfort food. I adored their heavy use of butter and rich sauces. Made me wish my dad's old restaurant was still open as it reminded me of my younger days. A neighborhood gem.", "author": "Elena N."}

Three course dinner is $50 or so, with the desert including a choice of cheeses and even includes a tasty souffl\u00e9.\n\nWe recently held a party for 20 people and were seated at one end of the restaurant in a cozy alcove which separated us from much of the restaurant.  All of our guests all raved about the food, the service and the ambiance.\n\nThis is a \"must do\" if you are visiting the city, and a great place for locals, if you want great food without the $150 - $250  per person price tag.

This was the only course that I felt was not great.\n\nCourse 2: Salade des \u00celes du Sud\nNotes: Incredible salad--the avocado was buttery, the mango was perfectly ripe and added a nice touch of tangy acidity, and the shrimp salad at the top was fresh and creamy.  Accompanying sauces provided a delicate sweetness to the dish.  Presentation was attractive.\n\nCourse 3: R\u00f4ti de Filet Mignon \nNotes: Filet Mignon was cooked to perfection, vegetables were also cooked beautifully, and the mushroom sauce provided a nice, unifying savory balance to the dish.  I would have liked to have had a bit more mushrooms in the sauce.  \n\nCourse 4: Mousse au Chocolat\nNotes: Creamy, delicious chocolate mousse accompanied by whipped cream and chocolate bits.  Very satisfying end to a delicious meal.\n\nThe reason for the 4-stars review (as opposed to 5 stars) was because the potato leek soup was a bit underwhelming, service was slow (although, to be fair, it was quite busy in the restaurant), and the French bread was a bit tough and served cold.  Otherwise, the restaurant d\u00e9cor and ambience is engaging, the food was mostly excellent, and it was quiet enough to have a private conversation.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-10-07", "description": "Very romantic and charming little subterranean restaurant, almost cave-like with stained glass and alabaster alcoves, white tablecloths, a hushed environment and old world elegance, a throwback to another era, oozing good times to come. Be forewarned: on Sat evenings, beginning early, there's live music, and on the night we were there , a single violinist played. This is the sort of thing you either love or hate, and I detest it. As soon as she began playing, we implored our server if the violinist could play on the other side of the restaurant, promising that we'd \"eat fast\" and leave as quickly as we could. The music was too shrill for my aging ears, making it hard to talk, listen, and enjoy our food. I understand that for many people, live music adds to the ambience, and if this is your thing, you should go on Sat nights. Except for the violin, we adored this place: it jogged many memories of decades earlier when this was de rigueur  for 'fine dining,' especially for French cuisine. It's a prix fixe menu, which a bargain for $54, a four course menu of daily soup, choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert. There are many choices in each category and a supplemental charge of $6 for assorted items, e.g. rack of lamb, filet mignon, foie gras, etc. The french bread arrived crusty and warm, followed by the cauliflour soup, which was fantastic--they could've laden it with heavy cream and butter, but no, they didn't. They preserved the essence of the vegetable with minimal processing, but retained the puree consistency--we loved it. I got the layered avocado, shrimp, and mango 'salad,' which was more of a layered mix of pristine ingredients, singing with integrity. My husband got their greens salad with pear, walnuts, and truffle cheese. We both got their rack of lamb, incredibly moist and tender, cooked perfectly at the medium temperature I'd asked for. I was a tad disappointed that it wasn't more flavorful (it wasn't char-broiled, etc.), but to be fair, it wasn't billed as such on the menu. It grilled simply, preserving the essence of the fine quality of meat. Accompanied with au gratin potatoes, cooked perfectly with just the perfect amount of cream and cheese. Also with carrots and asparagus. Then came the piece de resistance: we both couldn't resist the grand marnier souffle. I've eaten my share of these around the world, and let me tell you: anyone who doesn't fall in love with this is a moron.When the souffle came to the table, I was gobsmacked into silence, into submission. It was a far more generous portion for each of us than I could've imagined. Served in a large ramekin, a puffy cloud of deliciousness, so light and ethereal and cloud-like, a wisp a puff of air, barely beaten into a hovering ... I was worried it might float away before I could eat it. We poked a little hole into which we poured a bit of the grand marnier sauce, drizzling some on the top. OH. MY. GOODNESS. What is going on in that kitchen? Who is baking this? Is there a Nobel prize for culinary art? The baker needs to get one pronto. This souffle is one for the ages--melts in my mouth, disappeared within a millisecond, pure and decadent, lusciousness all the way through the palate. I ate the whole damn thing and lived to regret it.The sauce is subtle and did not beat me over the head with pure alcohol, which I hate and so common. I swoon just thinking about this souffle. Wow wow wow, how did I never discover this little gem of a restaurant? The price point could not be better. And the service is at once gracious, genteel, kind, and down to earth. We'll be back but not on a Sat :-)", "author": "Ranjan P."}

The only first course choice is the mushroom soup, I found a hair in it, the flavor was dull, and it was badly presented, which could have ruined the rest of the dinner for me.  The Fillet Mignon was stringy and the steak quality was very low end, aside from cooking.  I am not easily disgusted, but alongside these cons, there was a cancer in food warning to the right of the door walking in, and the underground dining room looks like a torture chamber.

Made reservations through OpenTable but in person, it seems to be run more low key. All reservations were handwritten and confirmed via a piece of paper. And they were actively turning away patrons with no reservations so consider yourself warned.\n\nMeal began with freshly toasted baguettes and butter - delicious. Don't underestimate the power of toasted bread.\n\nNext came our first course, a celery root soup. It was good. Earthy, sweet, not too creamy. \n\nFor the second course, my friend had the escargots and I had the charcuterie plate. The escargots were delicious, but really, how can you not like something baked in butter, garlic, and parsley? As for my charcuterie plate, I was surprised it didn't come with bread...or maybe you were supposed to rely on the complementary baguettes? It also had interesting plating with some butter lettuce salad in the middle and some pickles off to the side. That said, the combination of meats was very good. The pate and duck rilette was savory and creamy contrasting nicely with the saltier parma ham and the harder, more textural salami. I could have used something fruity to tie it all together though.\n\nFor our entrees, my friend had the lamb sirloin while I went for the seared halibut. The lamb was cooked to specification: medium rare. It had a bit of gamey flavor, but not overbearing. As for my halibut....poor thing was completely overdone. Where I expected flakey buttery fish I had fish that was chewy and shredded with a knife. A bit of a disappointment. My favorite part of the dish were the scalloped potatoes.\n\nLast but not least, the greatest redeeming factor. For dessert, we were both called to the souffle. Oh my, this was a real winner. Delivered piping hot and sky high, the souffle was excellent. Smooth, fluffy, creamy. It hit all the right notes. The Grand Marnier sauce was subtle but just enough to provide that extra touch.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

(3) Brought each of our deserts out 15 minutes apart (4) made us wait 25 minutes for the check. \n\nFood was great, but be careful which server you get.

I originally dined here Dec 2017 with a group of colleagues and I was impressed then (but not enough for me to write a review).  In March 2018, I went to Paris for vacation (and of course dine in many places); now I returned back to Jeanne D'Arc and feel that I have enough experience to compare Parisian cuisine with this still relatively little known place.  First of all, the prix fixe menu has so many variety, from seafood, duck to lamb and steaks.  Even if you try one main course at a time, it will take still 7-8 times to try everything.  So far I highly recommended the lamb and the beef.  However, escargot and the souffle steal the show.  The bread they serve is comparable to ones we had in Paris, crunchy on the outside and soft and moist inside.  Seafood, however, is on the average side - I had the Prawns/scallops dish while my colleague had the salmon. \n\nWell, back to the comparison to my Parisian experience - the restaurants were hit and miss.. but Yelp can guide you to some really good places.  Jeanne D'Arc is a place you don't have to sit in a plane for 11 hours to get to, and you don't have to suffer the typical French customer service (yes, what they say is true about their attitude).  Plus you cannot find a comparable restaurant for the same price as Jeanne in Paris.... and the water is free in SF!\n\nPlan ahead and make a reservation now!  The restaurant is a bit on the small side (like in the EU) and you cannot just walk in.  I might see you there!  :)", "author": "Rainbow L."}

His hard work paid off as this place truly lives up to all the hype on Yelp. The restaurant decor is more old school Europe and the place is quite cozy. \n\nThey have a four course menu for $48/person+. You can choose your second course, entree (most of which are included in the $48, with a few items being $4-6 more), and dessert. The soup is a set soup that alternates every so often. We had tried the following:\n\nSECOND COURSE:\n- Escargots de bourgogne: snails cooked with garlic, butter, and parsley. This was beyond delicious as the snail and garlic butter married so well.\n- Salade de molinon: spinach salad with mixed fresh and naturally sweet berries, glazed walnuts, and truffle cheese. This is not your ordinary salad as the berries were so fresh and sweet and married well with the spinach. The dressing also elevated the dish rather than overpowering it.\n\nENTREE:\n- Confit de canard: duck leg confit with a red wine and shallot sauce. This wasn't my favorite dish, but it was cooked well as the duck leg skin was nice a crisp and the duck was cooked perfectly. The sauce was ok and I left most of it on my plate.\n- Carre d'agneau des alpages: rack of lamb with a red wine shallot sauce (it was a well spent $6 upgrade). This was by far the better of the two dishes as the lamb melted in my mouth and wasn't chewy at all. The smoky lamb flavor was so good I almost wish we ordered two lamb racks.\n\nDESSERT:\n- Souffle au grand marnier: orange liqueur souffle. Yes, we both got it as it was that good! The top of the souffle was nice and chewy while the inside was nice and airy. It was mildly sweet just how I love my desserts. \n\nBy the end of the meal we were so stuffed! Never in my life would I think that a French restaurant would fill me to the brim. This place is worth every penny and their service is incredibly attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to make our night amazing.

The restaurant had a male opera singer that was performing inside which I really enjoyed! The food was a bit above average compared to some of the French restaurants I have been to.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-11-25", "description": "My husband and I chose this restaurant for our \"non rehearsal\" wedding rehearsal dinner.   We first came to Jeanne D'arc a year or so earlier with my then fianc\u00e9's parents, and we had a wonderful evening.  That is precisely why we chose this spot for the \"rehearsal\" dinner.  Our goal was to have a cocktail hour prior to a sit down dinner. We wanted the dinner to come as close to a restaurant experience as possible.  Jeanne D'arc met and exceeded our expectations.  If I could give them bonus stars, I would. Few restaurants are capable of giving their private dining guests the top notch experience we had. Prior to choosing Jeanne D'arc I had contacted several other restaurants, and even after informing them that there was no budget, they were incapable of giving us a true restaurant experience and instead insisted we adhere to pre-set menus and a cookie cutter event. \n\nI booked the restaurant six (6) months ahead of time for about 60 guests.  Franck was incredibly helpful and sent me some menu suggestions immediately.  He even let me know that they could have the souffl\u00e9 available as a dessert choice, which absolutely floored us because those are not easy to make for such a large group, They did not require any deposit until about a month prior to the event when we scheduled an in person meeting with them to go over the final details.  \n\nFrank worked with me to ensure my rearrangement of the tables to accommodate  my seating chart was possible.  The space is an odd shape but Franck and I were able to make it work.  He offered to have special menus typed up at no extra charge. Although my guests had made their dinner choice months in advance, they could still change their order at the last minute.  Because I do not live in San Francisco, Franck allowed me to mail the seating chart poster, the place cards, place card holders, and table name holders prior to the event. He and his staff set everything up perfectly according to the seating chart. He even sent me photos of each item as it was delivered so I would know he got it.  He  found a name error between the seating chart and the place name cards (I had accidentally listed my sister under her maiden name on the seating chart and with her married name on the place name cards).  By doing so, Franck allowed me the necessary time to reorder another seating chart if I so chose.  Franck's immaculate attention to detail made this a wonderful experience.\n\nIf that doesn't convince you to try this restaurant out for your next event then maybe this will; my wedding was over the weekend of October 14, 2017.  There were a lot of fires in Napa and the smoke from those fires were affecting incoming flights.  While most of my guests came in the night before the rehearsal dinner, some family members, including my parents, were severely delayed.  Our dinner was supposed to start at 6 pm but that was about when my parents, and a few other family members were able to get to San Francisco due to the flight delays.  I called Franck early the day of our event to ask if we could push it back one hour so everyone could make it.  He happily agreed and said it was not a problem.  When my sister, parents, and some close family friends arrived after dinner was almost finished, Franck personally took their orders and made sure each received the same 5 star service the rest of the group had gotten.  I was incredibly impressed.\n\nTo top it all off, Franck surprised me by bringing his camera and taking tons of photos during the event. We had not hired a photographer for the dinner, but I was so glad Franck took and sent me those photos.  They are some of my most cherished photos from the wedding weekend. \n\nThe prices were insanely reasonable and the quality of the food and service were exceptional.  For about 60 people, I think we paid less than $10,000 (with champagne, and wine etc).  I actually emailed Franck twice to make sure he had charged us correctly.  He emailed back twice telling me that the bill was in fact correct.  Best dinner EVER! Thank you!", "author": "Julie B."}

Different strokes I suppose as no one at the table particularly liked it. They had a 4 course prix fixe menu. First course was soup, second was the choice of an appetizer, third was an entree choice and fourth was dessert. Pretty straight forward. I had the butternut squash soup, the escargots, the rabbit and a strawberry tarte. The food was quite yummy. I really liked it and my colleagues seemed to like it to. The only issue I had was that the waiter didn't attend to us much after we ordered and that he over-poured the wine. Our glasses were so full, it was inevitable that we had to get a second bottle and this dinner was not cheap. I wasn't a fan of that and it left a bad taste in all of our mouths.

After numerous meals there it is still easy for me to pick a favorite. I order whatever rabbit dish they happen to be serving that night. I have never been disappointed.  The little darlings decimate my garden annually ...so there! The salads are often served with a slice of quiche which is always an interesting touch. You will find there many typical French offerings, cuisine traditionelle, as you can see from their published menu.  It is quite impossible to make a bad selection.\n \nUntypical is the good news that portions are quite hearty, substantial actually.  While this, one hand as a good thing, it would be a shame to pass up dessert.  They are extraordinary here.\n\nIf you are staying in the hotel, be sure that breakfast is included in your reservation.  Breakfast in the Jean d'Arc room is sumptuous and delicious.  Tables are served, it is not a buffet, and the offerings are exquisite.\n\nThe hosts/owners of the hotel are remarkable and contribute greatly to its charm. Sabine and Claude Lambert are always willing to converse and share interesting information about their art displays and France. They recognize diners and contribute greatly to the welcoming atmosphere of the hotel.\n\nVive l'amour!\nEnjoy!", "author": "Linda B."}

She wanted French cuisine, and I discovered this hidden gem that she had never heard of; even though she is a native San Franciscan! We first spotted the entrance from across the street. It was specially lit for the Christmas holiday, and appeared like something out of a fairy tale.. Unique. Special. Beautiful. Inviting. We were greeted by Monsieur Lambert, the owner, himself. What a gracious and delightful gentleman! We were directed to the old world style elevator, which delivered us to the restaurant downstairs. Our quiet, secluded, romantic table (that I had requested) was everything I had hoped for.. perfect. The food was outstanding, and there was (thankfully) not a lot of background noise, so I was able to speak to, and listen to, my darling lady, quietly and confidentially. Our server, Roberto, was friendly, professional, experienced, knowledgeable, and helpful when it came to food and wine choices. He was also accommodating enough to take a picture of my lady and I together in our booth. All of the staff we encountered that night were wonderful! The rest room was the cleanest I think I've ever seen.. anywhere. The entire restaurant and hotel (what I saw of it) clearly reflected the pride of ownership and outstanding care of the Lambert Family. This is not a place for loud-music-loving youth. This is a place for true romantics who have the maturity to appreciate such a gem as this. When we left, I turned to my beloved and said to her, \"From this night on, Jeanne d'Arc is OUR place.\" I cannot recommend this fine establishment highly enough.. It is five stars beyond \"Excellent!\"", "author": "Daniel Deveron B."}

Rounded up to 4, because I loved the ambiance and decor of the restaurant. \n\nWhile browsing different restaurants for restaurant week, I stumbled upon this restaurant's menu. 4 course meal for 40 dollars a person? In SF? French Food? Sounded like a great deal! Jeanne D'arc is located inside Cornell Hotel, and I loved the ambiance and decor inside. When you walk in, you'll be transported to medieval Europe with stained glass and a woman playing violin right next to your table. It was cozy and romantic. Also, Thank God for the violinist, because her beautiful music was able to drown out the noise of the loud, ratchet tourists sitting next to our table.\n\nOn to the food...we ordered:\n\nButternut Squash soup: Soup was served lukewarm and wasn't anything special. 2 stars\nEscargot: Absolutely delicious! Too many places, the escargot are too dry and not flavorful enough. These were fresh, packed with flavor and came out SIZZLING. 5 stars\nFilet Mignon: This was served with mushrooms on top of the filet. I'm not a fan of mushrooms at all, however on my quest to become a true foody, I am now forcing myself to eat mushrooms. So ignoring the mushrooms, what was disappointing was that the steak was just too dry and not tender enough. Didn't quite taste like filet mignon that I'm used to. 2-3 stars\nDuck Confit: The skin was crispy but the rest was just a bit too dry. 3 stars\nApple Tart: I liked the fresh apples but the crust was stuck between crispy and soggy. This was just okay. 3 stars\nSouffl\u00e9: This was the highlight of the meal. This was the fluffiest souffle I've ever had. It was like scooping into a pillow of Heaven. I also enjoyed pouring the orange liquor and the combinations were just perfect. It also wasn't too sweet which is the most common issue with desserts. 5 stars!\n\nOverall, the food was a bit hit or miss. The Escargot and the Souffl\u00e9 were absolutely delicious and perfect. The rest of the food was just okay. It seems like they're famous for their lamb chops and their duck breast, so wish they had those on the menu for restaurant week!", "author": "Tim L."}

Instead Diane and I were offered a full, multi-course, freshly prepared, and bigger than usual hot American breakfast.  I began with a welcome glass of OJ and excellent smooth Cream of Wheat in a large bowl.  Then came well made Scrambled Eggs with crisp Bacon and nicely oiled Roasted Potatoes, along with a disc of Orange, slice of Honeydew Melon and 2 full slices of toast and jelly.  I could have opted instead for cold cereal and French Toast, a stack of Pancakes, Poached Eggs, or an Omelette.  A choice of Coffee or Tea is also included.\n\nService was friendly and swift.  But besides the very tasty and filling food to help one jump-start the day was the outstanding and unique romantic atmosphere of the dining room.  Here walls are painted with various figures, statues of Joan of Arc stand by guarding diners, and even a collection of small irons is assembled near the restaurant entrance.  We were seated at a nicely set linen-draped table for two.\n\nBest of all, the meal was free (or, for cynics, included in the quite reasonable price of one night's hotel stay).  I'd share photos.

This restaurant is in the basement of a small french hotel up the hill on bush street. It is actually rather charming how you more or less just wander through the lobby and go down a small nondescript stairway to arrive at a cozy dining area decorated with swords, armor and paintings including one representing the restaurant's namesake. \n\nThe prix fixe menu included the rabbit, duck and lamb dishes but there were so many good reviews I had to try the rabbit. The escargot was my choice of appetizer and the souffle for dessert. I really enjoyed the escargot, which is a favorite of mine. The rabbit was a bit underwhelming though. Perhaps my expectations were too high but the flavor just didn't stand out like I hoped for. The vegetable soup at the start of the meal was also fairly boring and could definitely use some improvement. The souffle was perfectly soft and delicate which made it a nice way to finish the meal.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal here and thought it was \"A-OK.\" I really liked the atmosphere and about half of the dishes but I don't think I'd make a return visit.", "author": "Mark O."}

Why?  Because you'll commit crime after culinary crime here, and afterwards, you'll suffer no consequences.  Indeed, in the words of Bob Le Flambeur, you may even be able to sue for damages.\n\nRecently, on a dark and stormy night, I myself committed multiple crimes at Jeanne D'Arc.  I paid a mere $60 for a bottle of Cote Rotie.  I ate a four course prix fixe for $44.  I devoured delicious food at a fraction of what I might pay elsewhere and the staff thanked me for having the good sense to dine here.\n\nThe carrot soup is smooth as silk and just as delicious.  The salad is huge and full of fresh ingredients.  The real crown, however, is the entree - for me, rabbit - a huge cut of meat smothered in a rich and savory white wine sauce, some of the best rabbit I've ever had, and I eat rabbit whenever possible.  The desserts were divine.\n\nIndeed, the biggest crime I committed that night was that I sent my rabbit leftovers back to the kitchen because they would not keep in my hotel.  Were it not for such extenuating circumstances I myself would have demanded a conviction.\n\nDo I make the commission of these crimes seem too easy?  Of course I do - such rhetoric is my talent!

Walking down the steep spiral staircase and through a large wooden door, Jean D'arc will give you a taste of France without ever having to leave US soil.  Be forewarned that it is no Chez Spencer, Fleur de Lys, Jardiniere, or La Folie, Jeanne D'arc is a quaint and rustic restaurant serving home-style French fare.\n\nF O O D\nOnly a 4-course seasonal prix-fixe menu is available. For just $42 (website is not current), you get a soup and choice of a salad, entr\u00e9e, and dessert. There's a supplemental fee if you want filet mignon or rack of lamb.\n\nCOURSE #1: Soupe Rouge (Tomato Soup) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gFcSLTJo3HXdkXScg0FgcA?select=7BKGmeWbrjW6bOst2ZU5tg \nLike cream of tomato, the soup was delightfully rich, creamy, and tangy.

The fresh mixed greens were lightly dressed in a vinaigrette and then tossed with robust chunks of sheepmilk cheese, soft caramelized pears, and glazed walnuts. It had a nice symphony of salty, tangy, sweet and nutty flavors.   \n\nCOURSE #3: Jarrett D'agneau Du Pays D'oc (Braised Lamb Shank w/ Au Jus) - 3 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gFcSLTJo3HXdkXScg0FgcA?select=L2clpJgeZFKNx0wpz71QsQ\nLike a plate fit for Fred Flintstone, I was taken aback by the HUGE hunk of meat that lay before me with haricot verts (green beans) and carottes vichy (sweet baby carrots). Though it looked dry around the edges, the lamb shank was surprisingly tender and silky smooth. The shank would have benefited from being seasoned more, bringing out more of a hearty meaty flavor. I wasn't keen on the cafeteria-style veggies that seemed handpicked by the jolly green giant himself. \n\nCOURSE #4: Cr\u00e8me Brulee - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gFcSLTJo3HXdkXScg0FgcA?select=RH7VmAdvEM2t7cbavZlIcQ\nThe cr\u00e8me brulee had a lovely caramelized sugar crust which lead to the decadently rich and velvety smooth custard. \n\nSouffle Au Grand Marnier (Orange Liquor Souffle) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/gFcSLTJo3HXdkXScg0FgcA?select=a34qL3YJRAxa5Ml6kk1wZw\nA MUST ORDER, my friend's dessert was the highlight of my meal. Emerging straight out of the oven, the souffl\u00e9 arrived perfectly puffed up like a pillow with a golden crown. Delicately crisp around the edges, the souffl\u00e9 had a soft airy base with a subtle custard flavor. The orange liquor cr\u00e8me angalise imparted a fresh hint of orange essence. Each bite felt like I was eating a little bit of heaven, one cloud at a time. \n\nS E R V I C E\nDan, our waiter was super friendly, attentive, and made excellent wine recommendations. Food service was well-timed and we were never left waiting long for our next dish.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nJeanne Darc was a m\u00e9lange of old-world charm and French country. Oil paintings, stone pillars, scattered tchotchkes, and distressed woodwork created an eclectic (borderline kitschy) space unlike anything I've seen. \n\nA quiet restaurant, Jeanne Darc is perfect for a simple date or a small group dinner. \n\nP A R K I N G\nDifficult street parking. The nearest parking lot is one block away at The Orchard Hotel and the 450 Sutter Garage is two blocks away. \n\nBeing touted as one of the most expensive type of cuisine, Jeanne D'arc can give you a little taste of France without breaking the bank.

We walked down the stairs to the restaurant when we arrived, but when we left, we decided to take the elevator.  It's been so long since I rode in an old-fashioned elevator so it was a blast from the past. The restaurant itself is very festive with numerous drawings depicting French medieval life. Cute and quaint!\n\nI expected the usual sauce-rich French dishes but I was pleasantly surprised.  There were three of us, so we ordered three separate dishes so we could taste each.  I ordered the duck l'orange, one person ordered the filet mignon, and the other ordered the rabbit.  \n\nThe first course was the carrot ginger soup ... deliciously light and you can really taste the ginger. \n\nNext came the salad, we all opted for the shrimp-avocado-mango rather than the green salads. The sweetness of the mango complemented the thick rich avocado - yummy! \n\nThe entrees were all fantastic - my duck was cooked exactly as ordered: medium rare.  The rabbit was fall-of-the-bones good and flavorful.  The filet mignon was tender.  The green beans and carrots were fresh and done perfectly.\n\nAll of us ordered the souffl\u00e9 with Grand Marnier for dessert.  The female food server cut the souffl\u00e9s in the middle and poured the Grand Marnier sauce.  Heaven!\n\nThe service was also excellent.  Our food server made sure our wine glasses and water glasses were never empty.  Very attentive and courteous.  Oh yes, there was a violinist who serenaded the guests during dinner.  Nice touch!\n\nI will definitely return with more friends!", "author": "Chilly W."}

Especially since w had a 5:30 pm reservation last night.  Our party included an 87 yr old native San Franciscan who wanted to take her daughter to the restaurant for her birthday.  She mentioned to the waiter that she had last been there with her deceased husband at least 30+ years ago and that it was a special treat.  We were seated at a table for 4 in the rear, in an areas obviously used for housekeeping.  This included a child's seat, linens and a workstation.\nAdjacent to us were two lovely booths with reservation signage.  My nostalgic friend asked for another location but as it seemed inconvenient we took our place in the empty restaurant.  Soon tables filled, with some large groups and individual persons for dinner.  Although my back was to the filling restaurant I did not realize until we finished our lovely meal that the restaurant still had empty tables and that they were taking drop-ins at the door. Needless to say I was very disappointed with our seating arrangement, and unable to enjoy the ambiance of the delightful restaurant.   We are not tourists.  We were cordial to our waiter, and laughed at his haughtiness but really. We are all natives of the city and if my friend hadn't  already purchased a gift certificate for her son and his wife  I know we would not return.  She had an additional plan to bring her other daughter there in January but, I don't expect that she will .  If so, I Certainly hope they get a better seat. !", "author": "Julie M."}

In a non-descript hotel, in the basement, excellent service, food and ambiance awaits!  The prix fixe menu included cauliflower soup (not that great) and a choice of two salads.  Mine had baby shrimp tucked into a half avocado on a bed of greens -- excellent!  For entrees, we had the rack of lamb and the steak au poivre.  Both were expertly cooked and presented, and they were delicious.  For dessert, we both had souffles with a grand marinier sauce -- out of this world.\n\nA mistake made by the waitperson, who misheard my order and brought the wrong entree was remedied by a sincere apology and a small discount on our meal.

On this particular evening we were served menu items which consisted of vegetable soup bisque, escargot, caprese salad, lamb chops, braised lamb shank, and the infamous grand marnier souffl\u00e9.  The meal was executed perfectly, and no dish was rushed out.  The waiters and chefs had excellent timing.  The one element which really made this a special dining experience was the waitstaff.  Our waiter knew the menu, which enabled him to make excellent recommendations , as well as select a wine that paired well with our dinner.  He explained how their menu works, and what to expect and when.  As previously mentioned he did not rush our dinner, nor did he ignore our needs.  When we needed time to reflect on our main courses before partaking of the souffl\u00e9 he was very accommodating, and ask to instruct him when we were ready.  The dining room is charming, as are the hostess and other employees.  Be warned, the lobby area, and staircase to get to the restaurant is petite.

The plates were identical and the meat was cooked in the same sauce. Made me wonder if they just cook a big pot of meat. Just very wholesale type feel to the food.

Before you hit bottom, is the maitre'd who greets you.  \nThe inside of the restaurant is kind of a kick.\nIt's all decorated with French medieval design and the walls have hand-painted scenes of French citizens engaging in activities during that time period. ON the side of our table is even a sword for decoration.\n\nYou are essentially dining in the basement room of the hotel but it's a large room.\nWe were serenaded by  a violinist playing \"Moon River\", \"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\" and other oldies.\n\nThe menu was 4 courses for $48. \nFirst course - butternut squash soup with basil infusion oil on top.  Rather bland. I like the butternut squash soups I make at home better.\nSalad - my BFF's avocado, deviled egg, greens salad looked good.  \nI really liked my mixed greens with walnut, blue cheese, chunks of pear which looked like golden beets.\nHubby had the spinach salad which was tasty too.\n\nMy rack of lamb (additional $6 charge) came with 2 decent sized ribs, the sauce with it was good, we all liked the potato gratin which came with our entrees.  The one baby carrot and green beans were bland but I prefer them salt less.\nI liked my lamb (med rare).\nThe rest of the table had duck breast which was very tender.\n\nDessert - we all had the orange Grand Marnier souffle.  Each came in a small ramekin with the souffle whipped up light and fluffy.  You cut a hole in the middle and add the cream sauce.  It was a bit too sweet for me, but very good tasting.\nEven after consuming nearly all the souffle, the last 3 bites were still hot at the bottom.  \n\nOur server was really friendly and unobtrusive.

No amount of kitschy decorations will make up for the failures of this restaurant across the board.\n\nAlthough we had complained throughout the meal, as we were leaving, the owner was so clueless that he gave us cards that asked us to review their restaurant on TripAdvisor.\n\nI've had much better experiences and food at a much lower price.", "author": "Joe L."}

Had a 6 PM reservation tonight, a Wednesday, and the service was top notch. Ben, our server was attentive, friendly and made the overall experience very pleasant.\n\nFor those who say it is pricey, I disagree. It was well worth what was paid. Of course, my GF paid for it all, so that enhanced it. LOL!\n\nSeriously...I had the spinach zucchini soup, escargot, lamb with puff pastry, with gran marnier souffl\u00e9 for dessert. I cannot pick one thing over the other that was my favorite. The lamb with puff pastry was, no lie, amazing. The soup lived up to the reputation French food has for being rich.\n\n\nMy GF, Donna had a veal dish, and that was some of the best veal I have ever had. Our friend Sonny had a duck dish I have to try, next time, and believe me, there will be a next time. As for the souffl\u00e9? Another reviewer described it as \"tasting heaven one cloud at a time...\", and they were right. Everything, right down to the wine, in my case a Chardonnay, was simply amazing!! It's a quaint, even romantic little place. Guys, want to impress the woman in your life? Take her to Jeanne D'arc for a lovely, romantic dinner. You might just become a hero!

We started with a great (and reasonably priced) bottle of French wine and each of the three of us ordered the four-course prix fixe. Our first course was vegetable soup (blended and tasty, but not so filling as to ruin the deliciousness to come), and we each ordered the escargots for our appetizer (they were done to tender perfection in a garlic butter sauce). Unfortunately I don't remember all of the romantic French names, but between the three of us we tried one each of the duck confit, the rabbit, and the veal for our mains, all excellent (and tasted everyone else's, of course!). We finished with stunning souffles - not chocolate, as I actually expected, but a custardy vanilla goodness the likes of which I'd never before seen or tasted but had definitely dreamt of while listening to the Beauty and the Beast soundtrack (\"Our souffle, it's delicious! Don't believe me? Ask the dishes!\")  Beyond the amazing food, Jeanne d'Arc has the feel of a quaint French village from centuries past, and the wandering classical violinist really completed the old world aesthetic.

However,since we were going to in San Francisco celebrating my birthday we wanted to go somewhere special, somewhere romantic. This place sure fit the bill! \n\nNot only was it walking distance from our hotel, but the place is so charming and cozy yet has quiet tables for a romantic night out. We were seated at the back of the restaurant (like we had requested) which was quiet, romantic but never ignored. The waiter was helpful & attentive without ever interrupting our conversation. \n\nSince it's a prix fix menu, the options are of course somewhat limited, but honestly I didnt fell deprived or like I settled for something. I felt there were quite a lot of main course options, something for everyone really. We had a lovely leek & potato soup to start, followed by the avocado & goat cheese salad....excellent. For my main course I chose the duck breast with cherry sauce (yummy!) and my boyfriend had the rabbit in the white wine mushroom sauce. While I thoroughly enjoyed my duck dish, I have to say that rabbit dish was AMAZING and I am now officially a fan of rabbit! \n\nNext up was dessert. When we're ordering our waiter informed us they were out of the souffl\u00e9. I was a bit disappointed to hear that but figured their other desserts would be just fine. During our meal my boyfiend asked if there was any way we could possibly get one since we were celebrating my birthday. Our waiter said he'd try but didn't think he'd be able to make it happen. Well much to my delight & surprise they brought out a piping hot souffle. So I'd like to give a special thank you to the chef and waiter for making that wonderful souffle. And yes it's fantastic....perfect end to a rich meal....has the feeling of decadence without being too heavy plus it tastes really good! \n\nSo I must say, if you're in San Francisco & looking for good unpretentious French food then this is the place.....if you want \"fine dinning\" French cuisine cooked by a celebrity chef, then by all means seek it out, but don't bad mouth this place because it's great just like it is!", "author": "Kim R."}

Stained glass windows, stone walls, gothic chandeliers, all the works. But you don't go to a restaurant for the decor, right?\n\nThe food was really great. For a prix fixed menu, the portions are large. Every single dish we ordered was the standard size; they didn't skimp out at all! I was actually content after the vegetable soup, which was an appetizer, but the dishes kept on coming... naturally, I ate everything. I ordered the duck as my main course, and it was cooked to perfection. It was a full portion, so I was beyond stuffed at that point. \n\nOverall, it really is a nice place to go for dinner. The waiter was the sweetest man, and the owner also came by our table to ensure that we were enjoying our meal. I would love to come back to this city and revisit this restaurant.", "author": "Allison K."}

Once you walk down the steep flight of stairs and enter the dining area you get the feeling you're actually in the tight spaces of an old world eatery.  It's a nice diversion from a lot of the more modern choices you'll find in the city.\n\nThe prix fixe menu had so many great choices we split them up between us so that we could sample each.  There really wasn't a bad dish.  I chose the rack of lamb for my main course which I think was the best of the bunch but it was a tough call.\n\nWe had our waiter choose a relatively inexpensive bottle of French pinot noir that was delicious.  If I knew more about wine I'd comment on it, but suffice to say it was a great pairing.\n\nThis meal was one of the few times I've been really happy I saved room for dessert.  They were the highlight.  \n\nThe lowlight was probably the woman walking around the tables playing violin which too loud and honestly not that pleasant to listen to.", "author": "Stephen C."}

The ambiance is classic French rustic, fairly quiet and intimate, the kind of place you could wear your Sunday best, or feel completely comfortable in jeans.\n\nThey offer a four course menu for $40, with they call prix fixe, but you actually have quite a few options. Every course was delicious, starting with a vegetable soup (no options on that one) and a choice of salads, of which I had a really great avocado salad. There are around ten entree options, which all looked delicious, but I went with the rabbit, which came with a side of rice, green beans, and carrots. The portion was larger than I was expecting for the price, and the food was wonderful. Last but certainly not least, you're offered a choice of three desserts, and while I'm sure the others are good as well, seriously, get the orange liqueur souffle if they have it that day. It was to die for. They punch a hole in the top and pour cream into it at the table... wow. \n\nTheir extensive French wine collection is also worth noting.

Besides the 4 stars and the  announcement on yelp that mentioned  this deal, I was also interested because the restaurant included my name. LOL\n\nIt was a rainy day and Elease and I both barted out to the rainy city in our dressy outfits and stilletos. We like to dress up when we dine out to make things fun. Then we camera whore like crazy and take a zillion pics of our food before consuming it while everyone watches us like retards. No joke!\n\nThe restaurant is really cute and cozy and located in the Cornell Hotel. The decor is really cheesy but its okay. We started the night with a nice bottle of French Bordeaux. As part of 4 course meal, it includes a soup, salad, entree and dessert.  The soup of the day was a potato and leak soup, all the other categories had mutiple selections we could choose from. We both chose the salad with the mixed greens, white asparagus and dijon mustard dressing. That was A-OK. For the entree I chose the lamb shank which was recommended by our impeccable server Jean -Leon.  It was delicious and huge! Elease ordered the salmon and she said it was somewhat bland.\n\nFor the dessert we decided to order something different things so we can pick off each other. We ordered the grand marnier souffle and the fresh fruit sorbet. Becasue it was the end of the night they brought out an extra souffle so we had 3 desserts to share. Dessert overload! It was awesome and nice of them. They probably saw what pigs we were and knew we would devour our dessert too. AND they were right! I highly recommend the souffle. Its taste like sweet battered eggs baked in a soufle perfection paired with milk that we pour on ourselves. The sorbet was good too but nothing too special.\n\nOverall, I'm glad we decided to drag our butts from market to bush in the rain. Totally worth it!", "author": "Jeanne L."}

The restaurant is cozy, small, and decorated perfectly to depict casual French bistro dining in the countryside.  \n\nAll elements of the meal were five-star: The atmosphere was warm and the decor simply made us smile.  The service was attentive, efficient, but not hovering.  There were no weak points in the menu.  The first course was a perfectly seasoned gazpacho.  For the second course I chose the seafood pate with lobster cream sauce (which was a rich, luscious classic French sauce).  An intermezzo of pear sorbet and Chambord   followed.  For my entree I enjoyed fresh salmon with a superb cream sauce.  The salad green was lamb's ear with a slab of fresh brie.  The dressing was a simple vinaigrette and  was superb.  Dessert was one of the souffle's so many reference in these reviews, but was Orange Liqueur, rather than Grand Marnier (there was, however, a Grand Marnier sauce provided).\n\nThe price/value ratio was superb.  The portions were larger than any of us expected, but we were still able to do serious damage to all five courses.  \n\nThe wine list was of moderate size, but well chosen for the venue.  The wine prices were among the best I've encountered in San Francisco (or West Coast) dining.  The list could benefit from more 1/2 bottles (they had a few) and by-the-glass offerings.\n\nOverall, again, a five-star experience.

Now every restaurant has a bad day and unfortunately, this was theirs and they went down in almost every area.  The staff was polite but not knowledgable about wine.

Spilling water on our food as they tried to refill glasses, a white wine was tepid to begin with and never put in an ice bucket to cool, the maitre'd/owner (?) came by to ask us how we were doing and when we asked for more water (due to it being so warm in there), he walked away; I felt I was back in Paris. Food came out lukewarm, which was probably the wait staff as it was over cooked. Ah, the food. Started out good but starting with the entrees, all downhill. The fish was as if it had been frozen, then left out too long, then overcooked. The sauce did not compliment it at all. No one finished theirs. The filet mignon was better, but not much.

Mixed review from me, not sure if some of the more higher-rating reviewers here went to the same restaurant.\n\nPros:\nService was great. Waiter was very attentive. Everything right on time.\n\nWatercress soup was very good. \n\nThey had a violinist playing, which was very nice.\n\nCons:\nDecor was bizarro. I understand the medieval French theme, but I had flashbacks to Sleeping Beauty's castle at Disneyland. Lots of faux castley-looking things and random pseudo-French knicknacks everywhere. Kind of over the top. Certainly not relaxing, and a bit claustrophobic too, especially since the restaurant is in a basement down a narrow stairway. They've done a fair job of hiding that fact, but it is noticeable and you can feel it. Felt like I was in a crypt beneath a cathedral, what with the stained glass and all, and the funky castle decor only added to that feeling.\n\nIn general, the food was pretty good, but as another reviewer has said it seems like everything is prepared in advance and then reheated. Reminded me a bit of hotel conference dinners or conventions where they prepare everything ahead of time and then heat it up at the right time for mass presentation. This was especially true of the side dishes like the potatoes and vegetables. My NY strip steak was pretty good, but that was mainly becasue of the sauce. The steak itself had the consistency of having been thawed after having been in a freezer for a while. Would expect better quality for a $42 fixed price dinner.\n\nSummary:\nLike I said, not awful, but not fabulous either. We won't be going back, and that's not because it was actually terrible. It's just that it wasn't great, the decor was kind of creepy, and there are many better options within a stone's throw that are worth checking out.", "author": "Luke E."}

The prix fixe was priced at $39 for four courses - but that's still a pretty good steal all things considered (though I'm a little sore looking at other people's reviews and seeing the former prices. Boo.).   The atmosphere is fabulously French Medieval - there's a small broadsword stuck in one of the heaters, and the walls are painted with amazingly detailed images you might find in illuminated manuscripts.  The violinist played standard French/Edith Piaf themes, and was neither loud nor intrusive in her performance. This isn't a haute cuisine place - it's the kind of restaurant that serves items you'd imagine being cooked by idyllic French families out in the countryside surrounded by fields of lavender or something. \n\nThe first course - fresh vegetable soup - was creamy and sprinkled liberally with julienned basil and black pepper. Totally yum.  I ordered the baby mussels for the second course, which were succulent and tender, bathed in this creamy garlicky white wine butter sauce that I could drink pitchers of if I could get away with it.  The rabbit was tender, juicy, and pulled away from the bone instantly.  I almost didn't need a knife. Plus the mushroom wine sauce it was bathed in was also amazing. \n\nOf course, the Grand Marnier souffle was delicious and light.  Actually, the owner came by (Claude?) in this stone grey, impeccably tailored suit to ask us how we were enjoying ourselves. Upon noticing that we had all ordered the souffle, he said (in a very French accent): \"Oh, ze souffle - it has no calories! It is like...wind!\" To which I replied: \"Well, this is the most delicious wind I've ever tasted.\" Yep, it's that kind of a place.\n\nAlso - my mother fell in love with the beautiful fresh flowers that were on our table, and our waiter came by with a half full bottle of water for her to take some of them home!  It was such a thoughtful touch, and one that could fit in the cup-holder in her car.  \n\nSo all in all: impeccable and thoughtful service combined with a unique atmosphere and delicious down-to-earth French food equals WIN.

I'm disturbed by all the positive reviews, which indicate to me either that San Franciscans have far worst taste than I'd thought, or that Jeanne d'Arc is just paying to post fake reviews itself.\n\nI won't say that the food was awful.  It was edible, traditional fare.  But the quality was a horrendous rip off for the price.  All those people who keep saying this place is a value?  They're talking about the size of the dishes, not about the tastiness.  And when I pay $42 for a prix fixe menu, I expect to actually like what I'm eating, not just to be presented with enormous dish after dish as if I were in a cafeteria.\n\nThe style is traditional French, with a great deal of butter and cream.  Unfortunately, it's also bland and runny.  The pumpkin soup tasted like it had come out of a can.  The salad wasn't fresh.  Neither was my trout.  In general, the vegetables taste like they've sat around for days, utterly tasteless.  And the grand marnier souffle?  Better, light and nicely puffed, but still bland, and not nearly good enough to make up for the rest of the dinner.\n\nOur service was bad (the waiter kept forgetting our orders, again and again).  And as for the much lauded atmosphere?  It's certainly unusual, but I'd call it kitschy, not charming.", "author": "Jessie R."}

But the meal, WOW. The prix fix menu opened with a soup course; carrot/ginger with a splash of basil. It was fantastic. Then I had the mixed green salad with blue cheese, pears, and walnuts. Scrumptious! My main course was lamb shanks which were served with potatoes au gratin, green beans and baby carrots. It was a tender as tender gets and full of flavor. But the finale was the perfect Grand Marnier souffle served with a delicious sauce. I'd consider this a very reasonably priced restaurant if you want to compare it to others in the city with a similar menu.\n\nA couple in the party were in the mood for beef (price upgrade $4 or $6). The steak with pepper sauce was cooked perfectly and my son-in-law make his fillet disappear in record time.\n\nThen there's the decor and staff. The restaurant itself is downstairs in a hotel. It's as though you walked through a time warp into a French castle. The maitre'd was gracious and personable and our waiter was a hoot.  Even the chef came out so say hello (it was a slow night).\n\nService was wonderful, too. The place is celebrating it 47th year. So, while this may not be the place for dinner every day, I'd say it's a perfect place for a special meal and a reasonable price.\n\nThe menu does change and the price on the website was off a few dollars.

Did they switch chefs since early March?  Do they switch chefs nightly?  Is Chef Boyardee suddenly on staff?  It just doesn't add up.\n\nTonight's saddening absences:\nAMBIANCE: The live music we liked so much in March was nowhere to be heard.  The violin added just enough kitsch for the spot to feel playfully classy.  Without it, the French theme feels brooding.\nSERVICE: The same man who served us with panache last time served us with panothing tonight.  And the meal was improperly paced.\nFOOD QUALITY: The duck was not prepared with crispy skin as ordered; the skin was instead inexplicably flipped upside-down and left to drown in an orange sauce, thus achieving the exact opposite effect of what we requested.  The potatoes au gratin were cold.  The veggies were soggy and over-seasoned.  Though warm, the bread somehow tasted five minutes away from stale.  And the pre fixe price increased to 42 bucks, which would be fine had the food been as good as before.\nVARIETY: The soup choices turned into a single soup choice: a bland cream of asparagus.\nDID I MENTiON SERVICE?: We wanted to return the duck so they could crisp the skin, and the hostess said they don't do crispy skin on their duck (um...so why did our server say that wasn't a problem then?  And I'm sorry, who are you?).  She suggested we just eat it-- she told us she likes it like this and we would too.  Oh, well okay ma'am, since you like it we'll just eat it as is then...\n\nI won't be returning here, but at least all was not lost: The salad was still good if not overdressed.  I wanted to French kiss the pastry chef for creating Gran Marnier souflee perfection yet again.  And the magnificent Sancerre saunignon blanc was there to soften the blow a bit.\n\nTonight definitely gets two stars. But taking my first experience into account as well, I suppose it's fair to walk away from Jeanne D'arc with a three-star rating.", "author": "Brendan S."}

If you ever wanted to surprise your friends with a cute, quiet out of the way place in SF, take them here.\n\nFirst of all, you can't see this place from the street, it is in a small hotel basement and as you go into the hotel everyone is looking at each other thinking where are we going. You even pass a Jeanne D'arc cafe and people look at the two tables and wonder if this is it - it is not.\n\nAs you move to the back of the hotel, you have one of those old elevators with the doors you close by yourself - sure you can take the stairs, but take the elevator it adds to the experience. You go through a short basement hallway, then surprise! It takes everyone off guard, like you found this little hidden gem. \"How did you ever hear of this place?\" is what I was asked most often. Sure, it is a little campy Joan but that is half the fun, the place does not take itself too seriously. It is meant to be funny.\n\nAtmosphere - I went here because it was quite, but not too quiet. We had a friend in from out of town and we wanted to be able to each other speak, but the place was not dead silent so there was energy in the air. In addition, this is a French restaurant and in the European tradition the meal is an experience to be savored. We were there for 4+ hours and so were most of the other guests that were there. They didn't rush you out, you felt like you could stay all day. I also see that other reviews called it slightly pretentious - of course, it is French, that is part of the French experience. I would have felt deprived had it not been any other way!\n\nJoe L. did not that the place was a little warm, I agree, but I always run a bit hot. The women in my party felt the temperature was perfect. Also, I did call ahead and reserved a quiet booth and we got the one in the far back corner - which was comfortable for the entire time we were there. I didn't sit in the chairs, so I can't comment to that, but the booth was very comfortable.\n\nFood - I thought it was fabulous. I was there on the same night as Joe L. we arrived near 7pm and we had no such problems with the menu. We had the Lamb, Sea Bass and Filet Mignon and everything was perfectly prepared. Nothing was dry, everything was perfect. My wife had the Lamb and she loved that too.  My only regret is that I did not get the souffle, one member in our party got it and it was \"to live for.\"  As I said, we were there all night, we got our deserts about 10pm or so and the souffle was perfect. I got to taste it, but wish I ordered it.\n\nI loved it - but I understand it is not for everyone. You have to enjoy the French experience and all that entails. My wife is from Europe and we will enjoy taking anyone from over there to the Jeanne D'arc and I'll take my family from Texas somewhere else.", "author": "Jim C."}

This is not one of those pretentious restaurants that serves dime-size medallions of meat with foam from some unidentifiable vegetable over a side dish of grain \"dirt\".

Nice selection of wines too, domestic and imported.  \n\nI've been here quite a few times, and food is consistently tasty. They have duck, filet migon, rabbit, fish, shellfish, etc. Duck magret is my favorite, served with a lovely fruit sauce. If it's on the menu that day, you have to order the dessert souffle with Grand Marnier cream - yummmm. \n\nThe decor takes you back to medieval Europe: wood beams on the ceiling, walls covered with whimsical frescoes (reminds me of illuminated manuscripts), armor, swords, and tapestries.

Known by many local French nationals, who are longtime regulars and/or friends of the owners, and those of us who are fortunate enough to have stumble upon it. \n\nThe ride down to the lower level of the Cornell Hotel de France, on what must be at least a 100 year old elevator, is the perfect precursor to a dining experience that takes you to another time and place. The decor is renaissance sprinkled with antiques and most often there is some sort of live music/singer performing. Having an accordion player during French dining is fun and adds to the ambiance. \n\nThe menu is entirely prix fixe which is nice if you enjoy a multi-course feast. A personal favorite is the Coquille St. Jacques since it is not always easy to find and is done well. The wine is reasonably priced and the service is exceptional. I appreciate the bit of pageantry the waiters display when adeptly adding the cr\u00e8me anglaise, tableside, to the souffl\u00e9 au Grand Marnier. The crowning finish to a delightful meal.", "author": "Alona G."}

The prix fixe menu had a lot of variety.  Butternut squash soup was really excellent--smooth and flavorful.  The duck breast was okay--wouldn't order again.  Gran marnier souffle was enormous--had trouble finishing it, despite being very tasty.  My only complaint is that we had reserved the table for 3 earlier in the day on Open Table, and had the confirmation on my iPhone.  Alas, we were not on their list, so had to wait more than 20 minutes while the maitre 'd tried to resolve the issue--they finally made up a small afterthought of a table in the back for us, as the restaurant was obviously fully booked.

The Allimant Laugner Cremant d'Alsace Ros\u00e9 is very highly recommended! Light, crisp, refreshing, a very slight hint of sweetness but very subtle. For the price of thirty dollars I was amazed that it was not only delicious but the mark up was surprisingly reasonable.  For example you can usually buy a bottle of wine that costs 30 dollars at a restaurant for under 10 dollars on your own.  I looked up this champagne and it goes for 20 dollars a bottle at very select locations.

Other French SF restaurants - Fleur De Lys, Dining Room at the Ritz, Jardiniere and Masa's (across the street).  I know it's not fair - these are world class restaurants.  \n\nJeanne D'arc has a lot of positves though.  It's a charming place  in the basement of the Hotel Cornell de France.  Probably seats about 40, so it's very comfortable.  Surprisingly the bright colors help to keep the basement sufficiently lit, and the noise level is fine.  Given the name, it's interestingly decorated with stained glass, swords, suits of armor, and paintings of battles.  Unfortunately patrons cannot try on the armor or eat with swords.  It would've been nice to drink out of jewel-encrusted goblets and eat with my hands.\n\nGreat service, they seemed sincerely helpful.  Dishes we ordered - salmon, halibut, scallops&shrimp, rack of lamb.  All were decent enough.  Salmon was a little bit better than the halibut, although the sauce kinda made up for it.  Halibut was a little bit dry - maybe it was too dark in the basement to see the timer.  It's probably worth going there for the souffle dessert, which I liked more than the entrees.  Oh I forgot to mention the soup, and the goat cheese salad, which were yummy.\n\nThis is a great place to go for a small family dinner or a somewhat casual date, but nice enough where you can wear a suit for a formal date.  I was wearing a cap and jeans.\n\nOn the way out I had to use the women's restroom because the one-stall men's restroom was locked.  I think the dude was passing a kidney stone in there.  Fortunately Joan of Arc was not in the women's restroom otherwise they would be serving sausage the next day.", "author": "Jimmy F."}

I figured I'd start with something small, like sushi in the Sunset, pizza in Glen Park, or burritos in the Excelsior.  But some friends of ours were in town for a wedding, staying in Union Square, and, having left their 3-year-old with the grandparents, were determined to go out somewhere nice.  After a bit of research I came up with Jeanne D'arc.\n\nFor a french restaurant in Union Square, this place is quite unknown, no doubt because it is hidden away in the basement of the quaint little Cornell Hotel.  But certainly the most salient feature is the medeival decor.  The comparisons to the Excalibur in Las Vegas are quite apropos, but don't let that scare you--it manages (for the most part) to refrain from tackiness or gaudiness.  \n\nThe menu is strictly prix-fixe, 4 courses for $32, with a selection of about 10 entrees.  Overall it's a pretty damn good deal.  Being total suckers for game, we the guys both went with the rabbit, and it was a surprisingly large chunk of meat, which might be why it wasn't as bursting with flavor as I'd hoped.  My wife's duck was perfect though.  As for desserts, it was all about the Grand Marnier souffle.  Mmmm....\n\nThe wine list was reasonably priced and quite manageable (though as usual I just stuck to Californians), and the Pinot we got was top-notch.  \n\nThe only real complaint I can make is that it is EXTREMELY hot in that dining room, to the point where you may well be sweating by the end of the meal.\n\nAll in all, if you like french food, medieval decor, and showing off your knowledge of arcane San Francisco restaurants, you can't go wrong with Jeanne D'arc.", "author": "Wes M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-13", "description": "Having been to only 2 French restaurants...I'm happy to say I've been pretty lucky to have been to two excellent places.\n\nJeanne D'arc is in a great little location (underneath the hotel accessible by an old fashioned gated elevator).\n\nThe mise en scene (if I might borrow one of my old film expressions) is awesome.  The surroundings reminded me of a cross between Lex Luthor's palatial underground lair (in Richard Donner's Superman movie) and a cozy little World War II bunker.  The decor is very relaxed and warm with many intriguing armaments (I saw a few large swords, gauntlets, armor pieces, a mace and a morning star) that gives the restaurant a nice medieval feel (very appropriate since it's named for Joan of Arc).\n\nWe had the prix fixe menu on a Friday night (Four Course Dinner for $38) and I was pleasantly surprised.  We started with some delicious wine and the fresh French bread and butter (yes, I know I shouldn't be impressed) which hit the spot while we waited for other guests to arrive.\n\nWe began with a tasty bowl of zucchini soup.  Creamy and delicious with just enough spice.\n\nMy salad was mixed greens with a mayonnaise mustard dressing which was very tasty.\n\nMy entree (I'm not a complicated eater) was \"faux filet au poivre\" (Black Pepper New York Steak Flambeed in Cognac).  This was absolutely delcious (paired well with the wine) having been cooked nicely and the sauce was very hearty and comforting.\n\nMy cohorts had the Jarret D'agneau Du Pays D'oc (Braised Lamb Shank), Lapin Chasseur (Rabbit cooked in white wine with mushrooms and assorted seasonings), and Confit de Canard, Sauce Bordelaise (Muscovy Duck Leg confit with a red wine and shallot sauce).  All were just as delicious as my dish so overall this place really \"rocked\" to say the least (if you can use such a word to describe French cuisine).\n\nTo round it all off we had some grand marnier flavored souffle and a tantalizing custard.\n\nOur waiter was one of the best I've seen.  He was very professional, personable, and friendly without any hint of pretension.  He made us feel more at home having a great dinner party and not necessarily in a fancy restaurant (hard to do in my opinion - to stay professional and have a comfortable relaxed meal).  I noticed a few people who were eating by themselves...which was a testament to the restaurant's ambiance.  It's comforting to see patrons who simply want to enjoy some excellent food in a place that feels like home.\n\nThe only negative that evening was the high temperature in the restaurant (which may have been perfect for some of the thinner older clientle but not for a plump 30 something like myself who keeps warm with wine!).  =)  It may have been compensating for the brisk downtown SF climate.\n\nIf you're looking for great French cuisine without the obnoxious San Francisco food scene surroundings (and it is sickening a lot of the time) I highly recommend Jeanne D'arc.  It is a great oveall package of fine food, fine wine, great cozy decor, and great service.", "author": "Richard C."}

We were on a serious hunt for a place to eat but we already know our options: One, we were in Union Square on a holiday evening so the food places was pretty much filled with people. Two, it is Union Square so we knew we will be paying 50 bucks for a meal that was totally underwhelming. \n\nWe were just walking around, went up to Powell and right on Bush. Noticed some sushi places but we almost missed the dinner menu that was posted on the wall of the hotel. We did a double take to make sure that there was a restaurant....4 course meal at 36 bucks. The menu looked really good compared to the other places around there, and for a few extra bucks we figure, why not try?\n\nTurns out it was our night, for there were a lot of reservations/parties and we were almost asked to come back for another hour when one of the waiters go, \"There's an available table close to the clock!\". And then we were seated quite promptly. The restaurant itself is on the basement of the Cornell Hotel and if you have claustrophobia, be forewarned! Seems like a lot of people usually make reservations since the place is really small, but has a lot of character (a mini armor suit, along with French country looking decor, and medieval themes galore). It could be romantic for two , but also good for a nice dinner with friends.The place was packed last night because of three big parties, but I would imagine it to be more intimate on any normal weeknight. \n\nThe mushroom soup was creamy and tasty, love the beets on my deviled egg salad. He ordered the lamb shank and I the coq a vin.  Lamb is very tender and falling off the bone, and my \"rooster\".... so yummy and not dry at all. The entrees came with string beans, whipped potatoes and ratatouille...  Reminded us of that scene in Ratatouille when Ego, the restaurant critic tasted Remy's concoction.  \n\nOH the dessert. I had to post the picture of souffle with the grand marnier sauce on my profile for your viewing pleasure. I never had souffle quite like it, to say the least. It was soo good, like melt in your mouth good. \n\nI guess the minus 1 had to come from the service. It was a pretty busy night as I mentioned, and only a couple of waiters were available. They weren't rude or anything, probably just overwhelmed with the rush of people that were there.

I can only echo what other Yelpers have said - other than the one who thought that this place was expensive.  A four-course meal, including a soup, salad, entree and dessert, anywhere else in SF, of this quality and portion size, would hit the wallet much harder, I think!  \n\nDH & Mom enjoyed the Coquilles St. Jacques; I (feeling carnivorous) ordered the rabbit (making bunny comments, naturally).  The sauce accompanying the Coquilles was lovely, or so I heard - the rabbit was tender and not dry, and seasoned well.  We accompanied our meal with a bottle of Dry Creek 2007 Fume Blanc, which balanced both the seafood and the meat nicely.  Lovely bouquet - but I didn't take the time to sniff out all the details - it was simply a nice wine.  \n\nAfter having read the rave reviews of the Grand Marnier souffle - there was no question about which dessert we'd select.  Perfection in a souffle dish doesn't BEGIN to describe this dessert.  Yum.   Triple Yummmm.  Our waiter even apologized before puncturing the tops to pour in the special sauce...   \n\nParking is reasonably convenient in the Sutter-Stockton Garage (entrance on Bush one block from the restaurant) for the walking-abled, and there's a passenger loading zone directly in front for those who can't do the hills anymore.  I don't know if there's a completely accessible entrance - my mother was able to navigate the short entry steps, but only just.  The old-style elevator was entertaining, and functioned well.  I really enjoyed the descent into the basement - it really felt like entering into a secret haven.  \n\nOne Yelper mentioned the collection of armaments - another interesting collection is the set of antique irons of all shapes and sizes.

The baby carrots were NOT baby carrots but rather the chiseled down things from the grocery that are just called baby carrots.\n\nI didn't have my dessert, as it took so long to come that I had to leave before I got it.\n\nI really really wanted to like this place, but I didn't.", "author": "Michael B."}

But the rating I gave, the 3 stars is only about the restaurant and not about the entity that sat across from me.\n\nIt was a chilly rainy day when I was introduced to this cute little place tucked away in the basement of a hotel up a mildly steep block on the border of Nob hill and Union Square.  I did not know there was a restaurant here nor a hotel but every block in San Francisco seems to have a hotel of some sorts so I wasn't surprised.  It was very very overdecorated almost to the point of kitsch.  Like Fuddruckers except with a medieval, burned at the stake French way.  It was charming but it was trying just a little too hard.  .\n\nThere was this Asian family with two small girls all dressed up alike in frilly dresses with pink bows in their hair.  Very well behaved little girls.  The only thing missing were white gloves.  It was so cute to watch them.  It was about the only thing that got me through the evening because it distracted me from my conversation.\n\nThe food here was very creamy and subtly flavored which is kind of not good in my book.  It is not bad per se but I happen to be a BIG fan of those spicy tofu bubbling volcanos of soup served in cauldrons of fire at Korean places.  And on cold rainy days, I'd be more like to go for the cauldron than for French fare. \n\nThe soup was nice, it was a pureed veg soup.  I'd just purchased a hand blender at this time and was on the lookout for new interesting blended soup recipes.  Smooth but again creamy.  I'm trying to watch my girlish figure least it becomes an unspeakable figure.  \n\nEntree was decent.  It was this mushroom puff thing that was creamy creamy creamy mushroom sauce (savory and delicious and finger licking good but so many calories) surrounded by this butter layered puff pastry.  The whole thing was smaller than my fist but the caloric impact knocked me out of the ring.  I usually don't fret like this, for one meal.  But it was creamy on top of creamy on top of creamy.  I felt a little claustrophobic.  \n\nJust about everyone here spoke French and it was pleasing to hear.  You could not tell it was a hotel restaurant which was very nice because most hotel restaurants should charge a lot less for the quality they serve.  \n\nThis was about the last time I had such sweet wine, I'm a chardonnay girl from now on.  \n\nAll in all, French food is creamy.  If that sounds like you, you'll love it.  If that sounds like something only once a year, you'll love it.  If cream is a dirty word in your book and you fear that one day you'll be the object of affections for chubby chasers, don't go here unless you have ridiculous self control and can tell the waiter politely that you're on a raw food diet and can only eat the salad.

The orange souffle was not bad, but nothing to scream over.  The caramel creme was kind of boring and the chocolate mousse was just passable.  \n\noh right, and the rest of the menu.  the shrimp avocado salad was pretty good.  It actually made me hungry and want to eat.  I had the filet mignot and that was quite tasty.  And it came out just like I ordered it: Medium rare, so I thought that was quite good.

I think I've tried every entree on the menu and I'm happy to report there's not a single dish that's not delicious.  My favorites would have to be the duck breast, black pepper steak, rack of lamb and lamb shank.  You won't be disappointed.  And for $38 for a four course meal, what's there to complain about.  The soupe du jour is usually a blended veggie soup.  I'm not a big fan of carrots but somehow their carrot soup always leaves me wanting more each time.  And I can't forget to mention their souffle au grand marnier - a perfect ending to a great meal!  It's always fluffy, baked to perfection.  When you call in your reservation, make sure you tell them to save you a souffle, they usually sell out by 8pm.\n\nParking around the area is really a pain in the ass.

I'd anticipated discovering a hidden gem, but found that this restaurant doesn't even rise to the level of semi-precious stone.  Part of what makes dining in a supposedly upscale French restaurant is discreet yet attentive service, and for a $100/head all in, I would've expected that.  Instead, we were given some grubby menus and ignored for 15 minutes.  When the waiter did arrive, there was no cordiality or the offer of something to drink, just a desire to get our order to the kitchen. As there didn't appear to be any option beyond the prix-fixe, we went with that.\nThe soup, a tomato veloute was abysmal: a can of Campbell's would've been far superior.  The simple but good salad was then followed by rabbit in white wine, which in itself was delicious, however surrounded by a gooey selection of gratin potatoes, sauteed mushrooms and what I believe may have been zucchini at one time that would've been embarrassing had it all come from a cafeteria steam table.  My date's filet was similarly unspectacular, being cooked well past medium rare.  The final insult was an under done souffle for dessert.  \nI'm truly amazed that this place has garnered so many stars, when the only saving grace here was the modestly priced wines; a bottle of Veuve can be had for $56.  On the whole, it had a  tourist feel: something I'd have ever expected in a town where authentic French food is not difficult to find.", "author": "Mike L."}

Apparently the staff knows each other though they are not affiliated.  It is in the basement of a bed and breakfast hotel and the decor is best described as medieval French.  Helmets, chainmail, stained glass, tapestries and painted frecos adorn the dining area.  The ambiance was very nice.  The night we were there (Saturday) a violinist was walking hroughout the small dining area playing requests and also setting the tone, very nice indeed.\n\nThe menu is a set 4 course Prix Fixe for a very reasonable $39.  The first course we had was a nice potato and leek soup.  The soup was flavorful if not memorable.  Second course was a salad or appetizer.  I had a goat cheese and spinach stuffed pastry with tomato sauce, my wife had a salad of some sort which I do not recall.  Niether was spectacular though the goat cheese was especially nice, if a little heavy on the sauce.  Third was the entree.  I have a new york strip with peppercorn and flambeed in cognac, the wife had blacked salmon.  The strip was overcooked by a mile and when sent back, i was told the chef cooked it correctly.  Medium rare does not mean gray to pink center, so no it was not cooked correctly.  I did get it corrected but by then the damage was done.  The wife's salmon was also mushy.  We attributed that to having frozen meat, both the salmon and the steak.  The steak simply rolled up like dead skin when scraped with a knife and the salmon had no definition or texture at all.  Perhaps a fresh salmon and a fresh steak would not behave this way.  We both agreed that the sauces were excellent and were the only thing that made the dishes palatable.  Fourth course was dessert.  I had the Grand Marinier souffle and she had chocolatte mousse.  Both were excellent.  We also had a nice california merlot with dinner that was excellent for the price.\n\nSo, $39 for a 4 course meal with some highs and lows.  If they were to use fresh beef and fresh fish (Hell, there is fresh salmon in Fisherman's Wharf) this would be a 4 or even 5 star.  Perhaps i should have gotten lamb or rabbit, but i felt like steak and they had it.  If it is on the menu, do it right.  As it is, even with the cost, i can't give it over 3.  I would go back to see if they improve on it, and for the atmosphere.  \n\nEDITED TO 4 STAR FROM 3 DUE TO OWNERS RESPONSE BELOW", "author": "Darren M."}

The walls had little people painted onto it.\n\nService was wonderfully nice, very warm and welcoming. Basically letting you dine comfortably.\n\nLast but not least the food, so for $38 you have a prix fixe menu which is soup, your choice of salad, choice of entree and your choice of dessert.

Both entrees came with vegetables and polenta. The polenta was a bit too buttery for us so out of everything on the dish that was the least favorite but other than that everything else was great. My lamb shank was braised and huge, very nice but its very very filling. My lady had the roast duck breast with the raspberry sauce, that was done very nicely also and the sauce added points~ \n\nOk guys, dont worry I'm almost done, and on to the dessert. Man o man, we both got the souffle with orange liqueur, see its either this or some other dessert that I dont remember and I figured its not much of a choice cause souffles are always better..hands down..unless its done incorrectly and by the looks of things that went on here I knew I could trust their souffle~\n\nSo to sum it up, great price, hearty plates, tastes great, wonderful service, cool rustic decor. I'm definitely coming back~", "author": "phillip w."}

The atmosphere was balanced in such a way as to make cramped appear homey and homey appear elegant. Not stuffy in the least. As other reviewers have mentioned you could feel comfortable here in anything from casual to fully formal. \n\nI'm not a connoisseur of French food, but we both thoroughly enjoyed all of our courses. We both chose trout as our entree and though it was good, I wouldn't call it great. But the goat cheese salad and souffle  - those I would call great! We also shared a very reasonably priced half-bottle of Veuve Clicquot - $28 if I recall.\n\nThe surprisingly fair pricing on champagne and the surprisingly small markup for a Valentine's Day prix fixe ($48 instead of the usual $38, while most restaurants were happily doubling their prices) are perhaps what endeared me most to this establishment. A visit to our table by the tipsy proprietor sealed the deal. \n\nAs for the reviewer who called this a \"tourist trap\", I wouldn't listen to that inane drivel. As a long-time resident of tourist-central (a mere 2 blocks from Union Square!) I know tourist traps when I see them.

I'm glad we did because the food was great and it was very affordable! \n\nThe restaurant is hidden under a hotel and we had a hard time figuring out how to use the old elevator to get down there. A man was nice enough to show us, and boy, did we feel stupid! It was a good laugh though.\n\nWhen we got down, the atmosphere was rather cozy and the decor was more flamboyant than I was used to. But who cares about the decor anyway, you can't beat a $38 four course French meal!\n\nIt was my first time eating French food and I was worried everything would be too heavy or creamy for me, but I ended up finishing everything! I started out with a creamy soup(I don't remember what kind), and that was very good. The second course was the deviled egg salad... no complaints here. Then the entree came, Muscovy duck leg confit with a red wine and shallot sauce, it was so good! I loved the sauce that came with it and the duck leg was nice and crispy on the outside but still moist on the inside. It came with a side of mash potatoes which I really liked. And I'm not usually a mash potato fan! When dessert came, we were all pretty stuffed. I had to force myself to finish the dessert (blueberry tart). The crust was very flaky and the filling was very good. It wasn't overly sweet at all(which I was worried about). \n\nTalking about this is making me drool. I would love to come back here again on any special occasion. \n\nThis place isn't too great for vegetarians who don't eat seafood or dairy products.

The food, atmosphere and most of all hospitality, is delightful. It is a bargain for authentic French cuisine.

Menu changes but price is very reasonable. Jeanne d'Arc from time to time has live entertainment, such as singing with accompaniment set in the background for dinner music. Last year the restaurant hosted a special Christmas Eve dinner/celebration, complete with holiday songs and festive decor. Car parking can be difficult. Powell Street MUNI station is blocks away. And there are two MUNI Bus lines that run along Sutter Street, not far from Bush Street where Jeanne d' Arc has been for many years, perhaps even longer than the \"theater\" next door.

There was a half of a broiiled tomato also on the plate which was not flavorful, but it served merely as a garnish anyway.
