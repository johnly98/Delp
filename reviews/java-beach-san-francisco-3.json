Good ratings so we checked it out!  I got the cinnamon roll shaped like a huge piece of square French toast.  I asked the server what were the ingredients and she said, \"a whole lot of butter and sugar.\"  I said, \"I'll take it!\"  I had it warmed too.  It was definitely buttery, sugary, lots of cinnamon, and DELISH!!! I ate half because it was really rich and too much for one person.  We sat outside and it was very nice but the angle of the sun zeroed in on my big forehead...lol so we had to move.  Very cute, down-home, beach-side cafe.

Not very busy when we visited and ordering was easy. Their menu featured several sandwiches and bagels, so I decided to order the Kerry Gold because I had missed eating a classic grilled cheese. We sat outside and the servers brought the food to us. The Kerry Gold was an unexpected open face grilled cheese! The cheese was melted on top of two thick bread slices. Even though I expected buttered up bread and cheese in between thin slices of bread, I still thought the Kerry Gold was good in its own way. The coleslaw that came with the sandwich was tasty.\n\nOne of our tables outside was a little wobbly, but not that big of a deal. There was plenty of seating inside too, but we wanted to feel the ocean air outside. Such a cute environment! I think I would try a bagel if I visit again!", "author": "Katrine U."}

Three stars solely from my experience with a drink (no food order). \n\nLocated right across from the SF Zoo and down the street from Ocean Beach, this cafe is conveniently located to grab a bite or coffee in the area. I don't know about parking during zoo hours, but during the late afternoon on a weekday, it was a breeze to get parking along Sloat. There are small tables outside to enjoy nice weather as well as tables for 2-4 inside as well as high single bar stools. Free wifi also makes this a nice place to work when it's not extremely packed. \n\nThe great thing about this cafe on top of the location is that they have an extensive sandwich and bagel menu. And based on the amount of crumbs on the tables, these are super popular items! While the prices of these items seem more expensive than others (between $6-10), they seem good to try. They also have soft-serve ice cream that is great for the kids that come through with their parents. \n\nI opted solely for a large (16oz) chai latte. It was warm and comforting on a windy though sunny day. However, it wasn't anything overly special. At $4.75, I thought it was a bit pricey, but worth paying if you plan to work here or head to the beach. \n\nMaybe I'll try one of their sandwiches next time!", "author": "Clarissa C."}

How do you mess up a grilled cheese??? By not grilling it and serving it open face. The cheese was melted but the bread was not even browned AT ALL. It was warm cheese bread. Both sandwiches were served this way, so not a mistake. And no, the menu did not state that they would be served open face. (BTW, the cheese was good tasting and the bread was fine. If the sandwich had been an actual grilled cheese, it would have been satisfactory.)\n\nThe sandwiches were both served with chips. These were the Kettle Chips from Costco. They were very broken, mostly crumbs. I would not usually complain about this but since the sandwich quality was subpar, the broken chips just added to the overall poor impression. \n\nThe Irish soda bread was bland and boring. Apparently it is a family recipe. Time for an update. Seriously. $4.50 for bland. Oh, and I had to remind them to give it to me.

There was constantly a line out the door, but we still found that seating was available inside and outside.  Since it was a beautiful day (without fog), we nabbed a table outside.  It's a casual spot where you help yourself to the utensils and waters.  The line moved quickly at the ordering counter.  Cashier was super duper friendly.  Food was also ready in a matter of minutes.  You pick up the plates yourself and dropped them off when you're finished. \n\nEnjoyed our meal without any fuss.  Food is simple and satisfying.\n-Smoked Salmon Bagel ($7.50): Served with your choice of bagel.  I chose poppy seed today.  Could have been better if more lox was packed in there but god enough for me. \n-San Patricio ($10):  Huge sando filled with chunks of chicken breast, avo, lettuce, jack cheese and onions on cibatta roll.  Served with your choice of kettle chips or cole slaw.  The sando was a huge portion packed with incredibly fresh ingredients. \n\nOverall, highly recommend this local spot.  They have the basics done well - baked breakfast pastries, granola/yogurt/fruit bowls, bagel sammies, cold and hot sammies and salads.  If you're a coffee person, they got you covered.  Could be a little pricey on the daily but weekend or occasional visits won't break the bank.  It's all about the location!", "author": "Liv A."}

This shop, surprised me and I would definitely come back! My friends and I ordered San Patricio and Kelly's Cove to share. There is so much filling in both sandwiches, we couldn't even finish half of one! Neither sandwich felt too heavy to eat; it was actually pretty refreshing.

This place would be an easy 5 stars in other places without so many stellar choices.\n\nQuiche is rich and 5-star wonderful. The spinach feta croissant is, too, when hot and toasty. Unfortunately sometimes they'll come out of the over still cold in the middle. The salads are also quite good - you may need to ask with special emphasis that they toss the salad even if the menu indicates the salad to be tossed.\n\nSandwiches are consistently good but not 5-stars amazing. However, the Grilled Apple Cheddar is waaaay better than I would have thought before ordering it. The cole slaw is also a cut above. It's mix of cranberry sweet and peppery spice that I think is much better than the mayonaisy glop many places serve.\n\nThe soups are good, with the stand-outs being the tomato bisque (sometimes called tomato garlic) and especially their chicken curry soup, which goes fast.\n\nIf they have the pre-made salted caramel cold brew I highly recommend it. Even if they don't, sometimes they can try to make something for you that's somewhat like it. Otherwise I don't think their coffee is consistently better than SF average.\n\nFinally, I don't normally care much for Irish soda bread, but give this a try. The folks behind Java Beach are legit Irish and they also make a variety of variations on the basic bread that make it more moist and flavorful than I've ever had before.", "author": "Nathan P."}

Unfortunately the girl making the sandwiches was busier talking with her friends sitting at the counter than looking at the orders ahead. As far as I can see the only thing that takes time making my sandwich was heating up the bacon. This procedure could have been taking place while making the sandwich before me.

Almost $13 for two slices of bread, with slabs of flavorless tomato and thin mozzarella (not the fresh mozzarella kind) with overwhelming gobs of what seems to be mostly mayo and a little pesto, making the bread soggy and gushing out from under the tomato whenever a bite was taken. It's all I could taste. It was yikes. I took it home to doctor it up, as to not waste the $13, but to no avail. I felt gross while and after eating it. I don't think I have ever been so disappointed by a tomato mozzarella sandwich in my life...\n\nOn a brighter note, the chips were good! I also got a root beer float, and at first they filled the big cup with a tiny two-inches of ice cream, and then gave me a bottle of warm (but good quality) root beer. The root beer instantly melted the ice cream, so I went back to ask for a little more, and received a generous amount.\n\nIt was warm and sunny out, and I sat on the patio, which was nice. I was originally planning to go back to try the quiche, but after that sandwich I am slightly afraid to try any other food.

I always order the same thing: an iced latte with almond milk. And I'm always very clear about it being iced because I used to work in the coffee industry for 6 years, so I totally understand the frustration of having to remake someone's drink, especially when you are super busy.  So I always double check my order on their screen to verify that I said my order correctly, and that they heard it correctly. And every time it has been correct.\nI'm not sure what quite happens with the communication after the transaction is complete and the order goes to the barista, but this is the third time they've made my drink hot instead of iced. \nI get that this is really not a big problem in the grand scheme of things (hence 3 stars instead of 1), but it isn't necessarily the mess up that bothers me, it's the way the barista handles it.  And it's literally the same barista that messes is it up every time. \nThe first time it happened to me, I just took the hot beverage because I really dislike frustrating people.\nThe second time it happened, I spoke up and it felt like I completely annoyed the barista.\nToday, the third time it happened, I enjoyed some passive aggressive attitude, as though it was my fault she had to remake my beverage.\nI get it. It's frustrating to have to remake a drink because it takes time and you have a bunch of other orders to fill.  But you should never make the customer feel like they did something wrong, when they didn't. If you're having to remake multiple orders, its most likely because you're rushing and not paying attention to the details.  And frankly, my drink order is pretty simple.", "author": "Samantha A."}

Their Bernie's Blend keeps me coming back - even though whenever I go in and order my favorite open-faced smoked salmon bagel with double smoked salmon, a meal which brings me great joy, it inexplicably comes out from behind the line here differently almost every time:  sometimes open faced & other times squashed together like a sandwich; other times with all the double salmon on one side and all of the tomatoes, capers & onions segregated on the other side (either of which presentations needs to be laboriously dis-assembled and then re-assembled with equal, edible, common-sense portions of ingredients on each side; sometimes with double salmon (as paid for) and other times not; sometimes with regular cream cheese, capers & onions, as the menu promises, and other times with shockingly incompatible sundried tomato cream cheese, which then needs to be scraped off for a total do-over.  Sometimes I get so discouraged with the inconsistent service that I ask for a simple toasted bagel with cream cheese and for all the remaining ingredients to be put on the side so I can just assemble it myself, but that request is usually met with a scoffing attitude from the unconsciously-incompetent millennial behind the tip jar.

We also love to bring friends from out of town because the location can't be beat.  It's just a short walk from Ocean Beach, so on sunny mornings it's so wonderful to eat outside and then amble on down the street to admire the ocean.\n\nWhat's great:\n\n* Love those women that work there.  I'm a big fan of cute girls with positive attitudes, and it seems that's all they hire.  Can't remember the last time I saw any guys working there so if I've missed them, my apologies.  Not that I don't love guys too, but hey, estrogen just squirms its way into my heart a little easier on a slow weekend morning.\n\n* Expect deliciousness.  I've never ordered anything there that wasn't delish.  I noticed that some previous yelpers have had problems with their orders being messed up but I've been there at least twenty times and that has never happened to me.\n\n* Coffee bar, baby!  They always have at LEAST four big towers of different coffees, and no matter what your way of preparing your coffee they'll have the condiment of your choice for FREE.  None of this \"extra 50 cents for soymilk.\"  Nope.  They've got stevia, splenda, the blue, the pink, the white, the brown sugar, the agave nectar.  Skim, 2%, whole, cream, soy, almond, you name it.  Pour it on in.\n\n* Outdoor seating.  On a beautiful day it's so splendid to look down the street and see the ocean and soak in the warm sun.  Sure, during peak times you might get stuck with a table around the corner in the shade, but it's still nice.  \n\n*Location location!  Within walking distance to the zoo and right down from the beach.  I've never been to the other location and I don't plan on it.  This one suits me just fine.  We drive all the way from San Bruno for this place about once a month.\n\n* Wide variety of selections.  Whatever you're in the mood for and whether you're vegan, raw foodist, paleo or diabetic sugar+meat-lover they've got an option for you.\n\n* Kid friendly.  Kids love this place and people love to bring them since it's right next to the zoo.  This is one of the few places I'm exposed to the lil' tykes, and it's always funny to listen to little kid conversations, so that's part of the entertainment I guess.\n\n* Great place to work.  They have wi-fi and it's cozy inside, so bring a laptop and pull up a chair.\n\n* USUALLY great parking, for San Francisco.  Unless there's some kind of event going on at the zoo, and then forget about it.\n\n* Dog friendly.  Bring fido, because you can always eat outdoors with him/her.\n\n\nWhat's less than great, but hey:\n\n* Slow service.  It just is.  I've never NOT had to wait in line, and once out of five times there's no seat because it's packed.  But all good things in life require a little patience, right?\n\n* Hella crowded at peak times.  And people can get cranky about you coming in and out of the door to get more water or bus your table.  Probably because they've been waiting in line for ten minutes and they keep getting bumped.  Crowded has always been a good sign to me, though, and something worth tolerating.\n\n* Outdoor seating.  Yes, it's good on sunny days, but of course this is also right next to Daly City in That Part of San Francisco, so it's usually foggy.  And that means it's cold.  When the seating is all taken up inside you're forced to huddle and shiver at the outside tables in the grey, wet, pea-soup fog.\n\n* Kid friendly.  So if you're out for a romantic date or trying to work on your laptop, expect the occasional scream or picky eater complaining loudly.  But hey, they look cute so calm down.\n\n* Bus your own table.  Yup, gotta clean up after yourself.  Which means some people don't.  So expect to occasionally have to bus your own AND somebody else's table if you want a seat.\n\n* Less than sanitary at times.  A previous reviewer mentioned a lot of crap on the floors, and that is accurate.  There are always all kinds of scraps of dirt or paper napkin or food all over the place.  This may just be a symptom of people bussing their own table, towing dogs and kids, and running in and out for various reasons; but if you're a stickler for cleanliness, just don't look at the floor.\n\nSo for me the good definitely outweighs the bad.  The ambiance is warm and jovial and the decor is very beach-y.  It's a relaxed place for families, bikers at the end or in the middle of their ride, developers/writers/university students, and even tourists.

Their drinks are wonderful and I haven't yet ordered anything I didn't like. The only thing is it's a bit on the pricier side in my opinion. It's a great place to stop by if you're ever around the beach or the zoo.\n\nThe regulars here are also super friendly and it's a super chill spot to grab a bite and a drink. They're open late-ish for a coffee shop, so sometimes when I don't have proper plans for dinner I'll drop by Java Beach. My favorites include the tsunami, any of their lattes, and toast.", "author": "Melody S."}

Unfortunately, I guess this place was so popular that they ran out of almost everything including bagels, pastries, and oatmeal.  Luckily, that lead us to discover the amazing arugula salad and fruit and granola bowl.  Their blueberry pie was also delicious and the perfect sweet end to our brunch.\n\nWhen we came back the next time early enough for breakfast, we tried the oatmeal (which was a little thick for my taste), a pumpkin chocolate chip muffin (a little too thick and chewy), a bagel sandwich (awesome), and the ham and cheese croissant (also delicious).  The beach is only few minute walk away, and on a beautiful sunny day (which I know is rare in this area), it's amazing to be able to have a hearty breakfast, walk along the beach, and then come back and grab a snack back at Java Beach.\n\nI would say their standouts are their sandwiches and salads, and I will definitely be coming back repeatedly to try everything on their menu!", "author": "Carrie C."}

Unfortunately, you're looking at a college student who is scared of birds. I just wanted to find a nice place to study with coffee drinks and lunch and I've heard good things about the sandwiches. But even before I ordered my drink, a pigeon walked in through the front door and flew around the kitchen annoyingly while the workers tried their best to shoo it out. That sure increased my appetite. \n\nThe Peppermint Mocha was not worth the $4 I paid for the smallest size. It barely tasted like peppermint. To top that off, about 6 pigeons walked in while I was trying to study for less than 2hrs, making me pretty uncomfortable with them walking around and having workers and customers try to shoo them out. It wouldn't have happened if the workers just closed the front door but maybe it's normal to keep the door open (who am I to know, this was my first time here). Wi-fi is fast and service is friendly, but who knows if I'll ever give this place a chance for their sandwiches. You def lost me as a drink place and study spot.\n\nLose the pigeons and I'd try the sandwiches there. But still, the thought of a pigeon feather somehow making its way into the kitchen makes me cringe. 2 stars for fast wi-fi and friendly workers.", "author": "Amanda L."}

Usually this place is a 5 start establishment. Today was not that. Never had I such a bad experience. \n\nI called in an order and was told to come in 15 minutes. When I got to the cafe, the guy ringing me up (same guy who took my order on the phone) charged me for three sandwiches when he knew the to go order only had two sandwiches (apparently he \"misheard\"). After charging me he informed me that it'll be 10-15 minute wait.  I asked why he thought I would want to wait, especially considering that I ordered in advance.  He then called over a crabby looking manager that wasn't friendly looking or nice but refunded me for third sandwich. \n\nI asked for a bag since I had so many things (ordered a drip coffee and a bagel too), and they basically gave me the smallest bag possible and stood there and watched me struggle to get everything in for a solid 2 minutes. All the while there was a growing line of people. \n\nI don't know if it's the weekend or holiday staff (I don't think I've ever seen these people before), but they really suck compared to the regular group.

There are two cafe's in the chain, one by the zoo and the other closer towards the cliff house, just off of Judah. Both near the ends of muni lines and perfect for grabbing a little picnic to eat on, or to relax in after a little stroll along ocean beach.\n\nI love both caf\u00e9s. They have relaxed atmosphere, are light and airy and ooze personality. \n\nI have to say I prefer the one just off of Judah, but that's because there are more places to sit outside and it's got the park opposite, so feels more load back than the one by the zoo which is on the main road.\n\nHowever there is friendly service, great food and consistency across the two locations, so there is little between the two locations and I would visit either.\n\nPerfect for a brunch, or using their free wifi, to sit and check your emails.\n\nI absolutely love the tsunami and bonfire sandwiches, made fresh and rammed full these are huge!\n\nAnd whoever thought of the beef and ginger sauce combo for the bonfire sandwich is a genius.\n\nAlthough I would recommend that you go for the mixed salad rather than the chips however with your sandwich order. I find them a little plain and lacklustre - and personally I am a huge fan of rocket (arugula here I the US).\n\nAlso check out the pastries, the croissants aren't half bad, I found it so hard finding decent ones in the US, and whilst these don't live up to the ones from France, they are some of the best I found. I really liked the grilled ham ones.\n\nCookies, muffins and cakes are also good and you get a good sized treat for your dollar.\n\nMy only criticism is that I really am not a fan of their coffee. Have a taste yourself, they'll let you sample. The French roast I found to be the best, and they have pretty much EVER type of milk and sweetener that you could think of, but I just never really enjoyed it. They seem a bit raw and burnt to me.

The lines will pile up, which is the only downside if all you want is a coffee, but it is totally understandable.\n\n$2.50 for a 12oz coffee, and you get to choose which type of coffee you want.

Parking is ample around the residential area.\n\nI can only selfishly wish that this place will not grow super popular due to the Yelp effect, but I do wish that they continue to receive ample business as it will further elevate Sunset's reputation as a new hipster hot spot for coffee loving, beach bumming, pastry hugging junkies.", "author": "David W."}

In addition to having the beach nearby, this cafe is conveniently located to attract more little kids to visit than anyone will ever know. The sunny disposition is shaped by a cast of young, energetic staff, young families that hang out before or after their outdoor fun; and graduate students who tend to stick around longer than usual with their laptops. Wink wink!\n\nInitially I was a little apprehensive about the prospects of the weather in the area, but it turned out nice and warm. Temperature inside was definitely comfy, and the sidewalk seating were filled with people basking in the sun with their pets. At the server's recommendation, my order of Kelly's Cove sandwich ($7.75) arrived warmed by request, and it had a thick layer of pesto and melted Swiss on top of layers of fresh greens and wholesome delicious turkey. The bread was toasted to perfection and although the pesto was a bit too oily, the sandwich was a hearty reminder of Darwin's Ltd. Gosh I miss that place!\n\nDuring my hours of work I also tried their refreshing iced tea ($3), dark house drip ($1.95), and a cup of vanilla and chocolate soft serve ($5+) to continue my celebration of the National Ice Cream Month. The ice cream was like the ones at Foster's Freeze, not too sweet but dense and creamy. It was the perfect motivation to get some work done. Although the seating area was smaller than desired, I really enjoyed having free wifi and the youthful but laid back atmosphere.\n\nA few limitations observed: 1.) It was a warm day so I hope they had kept their soymilk in an ice container to keep fresh, 2.) Even though the server had tried to sweep the floor several times, the nature of having so many little kids around requires more vigilance to keep the place clean. Aside from these minor issues, they have great hours, nice music, and a welcoming d\u00e9cor to keep you entertained. \n\nThank you Cassie, for the wonderful recommendation!

I've never seen any type of wildlife nonchalantly walk into the cafe. The back door is always closed, with the exception of the front. Alot of parents come here with their children from the zoo, for a small cup of after zoo ice cream. Its just a wonderful vibe. Its also pet friendly and they provide an outside water bowl for any thirsty animals. \n\nNow, it is a small location with limited seating, inside and out in front.

With friendly staff and wifi, it's hard not to like this place. It's a great place to grab something quick to eat, do a little work, or just stop for a coffee. Located right across from the zoo, there's usually a crowd of people in the mornings, and seating can sometimes be hard to find. As far as parking, it's pretty easy to find parking. Sure, you may not get the parking spaces right in front, but there's still parking in the Avenues or the lots for the zoo (unless you come the first Wednesdays of the month around noon). Little bonus, there's a small bathroom if you need.\n\nUsually, I get some kinda of bagel, but I've heard all their sandwhiches are good. My most recent favorite is the veggie bagel, which includes tomatoes, cream cheese, lettuce, onions, and sprouts. Though there was little too much cream cheese, it was really good! As far as beverages go, I've only had the hot chocolate, which was a little dissappointing. For me, a chocolate lover, it was a little too rich and not quiet up to par with other hot chocolates I've had. Even though the hot chocolate's not the best, don't let that steer you away from this place.\n\nSo if you're in the area and need something to eat, come here and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Alanna H."}

I can't believe they haven't fixed this (I would think they could almost double their business if they just took a clue)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI have updated this review on 1/7/13 due to a response from the cafe's owner; see below to read about that.  Here's my original post.....\n\nIt is impossible to get a seat in this cafe now, the food and coffee are average, their prices are too high, and their wifi sucks.\n\nSince their recent 'remodeling'/re-shuffling of their space, my guess is that they roughly cut in half (or at best a third) the number of seats available for individuals showing up alone.  The way their new, inefficient setup is, there are nonetheless lots of seats empty, but they're either crammed into a corner behind 3 or 4 people and nearly impossible to get to, or you'd have to sit across from a stranger and share a tiny table space (which I never see anybody do) the width of an actual surfboard (what were they thinking?!?).\n\nSince it seems that most of their customers are individuals, they end up taking up two seats, and I basically NEVER find a seat here anymore, and now find myself just leaving and going to another cafe 90 percent of the time (I have noticed that Beachside Coffee Bar & Kitchen a block away suddenly had a big spike in business after Java Beach re-arranged their seating, and I am not surprised).  \n\nNot only that but they've upped their prices to an unreasonable amount.  I think the only reason this place does so much business is there has been no competition near the beach.  They aren't good enough to deserve so much business, or such a high rating.\n\nOh, and their wifi sucks.  It's always very low bandwidth, shared by many users, and usually multiple times per hour it goes down and you have to wait until a barrista has time to reboot their router.\n\nUPDATE, 1/7/13:\nA months ago I received a reply from this cafe's owner in response to my negative review.  She agreed that the place can be pretty crowded with their new seating layout, and told me that they would be upgrading their wifi soon.  She also had the audacity to tell me that if I came between certain hours when a certain manager worked there, \"she will ensure you get a seat, and an espresso drink on the house as a way of our apologies.\"   \nI take this to mean that since I gave a bad review they would somehow get me a seat in their overcrowded misused space (how?), and a $4 beverage on the house.  So, what about all the other customers who can't get seats?  Will they need to write bad reviews and wait to get special treatment?  I am confused.\n\nI hear that for every person who bothers to register a complaint or give a bad review there are likely 10-20 others who had that same experience but didn't bother.  I'm guessing that's the case for this place.", "author": "Jason F."}

Coffee is excellent. Somehow despite the number of people who move through here, there's almost always a table. Tables turn over b/c it's not a laptop cafe, hallelujah. My one major complaint is that the bathroom is RIGHT off the main eating area, so everytime someone goes in we all get an unpleasant view. Worse, people frequently leave the door ajar or open.

Once arriving, the gal at the cashier was friendly and patient as I decided on what to order.  I was contemplating on whether or not to try something new, or stick with the BBQ Chicken Sandwich that I love there.  I finally decided on the known, along with a Green Tea.  For customers eating there, they have cute little personalized \"Java Beach\" mugs, that are also available for purchase.  \n\nI noticed the gal making my sandwich wearing gloves which I really appreciated despite her not handling any cash.  After a few disturbing experience at other places, seeing gals switching off from handling cash to making food, I've always been bothered by this little aspect.  But it was great seeing this gal wearing gloves and cleaning her counter after each order.  \n\nMy sandwich arrived, and it was consistent and satisfying.  After my sandwich, being the way that I am, I had to buy a cookie.  The Vegan Banana Chocolate Walnut Cookie made by \"Zoe's Cookies\" quickly caught my eye--perfect, chewy, soft, and actually tasted really good, despite my preconceived ideas about Vegan food being bland and boring.  \n\nThey also sell soft serve ice cream, available in Vanilla, Chocolate or Swirl.  Furthermore, they have a little bar area for Draft Beer and Wine.  Such a cool little aspect for a cafe.  Very well rounded items for sale here.\n \nI was quickly at ease from home life here at Java Beach.

This wasn't a touristy place but instead one that had a steady stream of locals throughout the time we were there. (A place with people during slow times has something going on!) Though we were there between traditional lunch time and dinner time, the offerings were the same. Items such as salads, sandwiches, coffees, soft serve ice cream, beer, wine and other eats. The place is small but organized efficiently. You enter through one door. Prepare to order, order and then sit at a small bar area, outside or the dining area seating. Once done drop off flatware, plates and recycleables in one bin and trash in another. This is a clean up after yourself kind of place. Wooden furniture inside makes it feel rustic and casual. Now on on the food. The portions are spot on and the food is presented well. The taste of the sandwiches was delectable. The condiments amp up the fresh ingredients. We tried the Caesar salad which was delicious and fresh. Perfect tasty dressing and not too much of it. The sandwiches we picked were unique to them. The had roast beef, cheese melted on Dutch crunch. The veggie sandwich had sprouts, tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, cheese, all seemingly farm fresh. The bread was soft and with chewy crusts. The coffee was so completely sensational. They don't let you know about the beans totally(read the sign) because if you knew you would buy them from wherever and make coffee daily at home.

BUT my main gripe is the service, in particular, the sandwich-maker, Dalia--young brunette girl with round face who is a serious liability to this place.  After waiting in a line that went down the block, I finally made it to the cashier and placed my order: Hummus Veggie Bagel and a large coffee.  When I finally got my order, it consisted only of hummus spread on a whole wheat bagel.  Hmmm, I found that odd and went back to read the description of the bagel on the chalkboard menu--yup, there should have been some sprouts, lettuce, tomatoe, etc.  When I asked Dalia (remember her?  round faced tall-ish brunette) why there weren't any veggies on my bagel, she proceeded to accuse me that I did not order any veggies.  Well, I guess i MUST BE a simpleton if I assumed the Hummus VEGGIE bagel came with veggies!  Should I have also specified, Dalia, that I would like some HUMMUS, as well?  How about I mix things up and order my Hummus Veggie Bagel ON A BAGEL???  I stood there a bit shell shocked, waiting for her to apologetically take my bagel and restore some normalcy to this whole situation...instead, she snapped at me and literally USED HER INDEX FINGER and pointed at me and then the line and told me to get back in-line to tell the cashier that I wanted veggies.  Well, considering the line at that point consists of 5+ ppl...how about NO FREAKING WAY, DALIA???  How about you learn the meaning of customer service, take back my bagel, and add some sprouts with a flick of your wrist  rather than continue to waste my time????   This girl's audacity was incredible.  I have never met anyone in the service industry with such a huge chip on their shoulder.  I had to take down her name because I was floored!  I'm from NYC--ppl are always giving an I-don't-give-a-fuck-about-you kind of vibe, but even this was nothing compared to what I'm used to back at home.  It felt like she was actively trying to humiliate me with all the finger pointing like I was some child needing rehabilitation for my misguided food-ordering ways.  If you're getting the slightest hint from this review that I'm a sensitive whiney person, I can only offer up that there was another patron  who witnessed this whole debacle and spoke to me in the back area about how inappropriate Dalia was.

It also came with a side of chips.  Sandwhiches come in small, medium, and large.  Portions are very large, so I'd recommend going with the small sandwhich, unless you are starving.

The sandwiches at George's Zoo were always raved about by my co-workers, but it didn't have any \"Wow\" factor for me. Then... the Java Beach Cafe opened. The first time I saw it, I had to stop and blink. After all, it's a very bright blue. How could I not have seen it before? And I have to admit, the choice in paint job made me think twice before stepping inside.\n\nI walked in with a friend the first time. I noted the polite service and nice variety on the menu. I ordered the basic vegetarian sandwich, on a french roll with no cheese --- avocado instead (because I don't do animal products). And for a beverage, I got a large soy hot chocolate with strawberry syrup (they will do this upon request). Once I got the food, all I can say is WOW. Tastes great, comes with chips, and is reasonably priced... Does it get any better?\n\nI've gone back several times. In fact, the last few times I've been in the Outer Sunset is because of this place, despite the fact that it takes me an hour of public transportation to get there. Needless to say, nobody I have ever taken with me has thought badly of the food either.", "author": "Alaka F."}

My boyfriend and I went the other week and over half the ticket was wrong.\nWhen we first ordered, we were shuffled between two cashiers. The woman who ended up taking our order was obviously not paying attention. We ordered a tuna melt, a tomato/pesto melt and two root beer floats. After 15 minutes, he finally got his sandwich... but my vegetarian sandwich was rather rung up as a roast beef. The woman who had taken our order just punched it all in wrong. My correct sandwich was then made. (Took another 15 minutes)\n Neither of us had our drinks. Apparently, you're supposed to ask for your root beer float at the time you order it, they don't automatically give it to you. On the ticket, she also rang up a large orange juice instead of the correct drink.\nWhen we asked to talk to the manager, the woman who had taken our orders wrong came over. Yeah.. the manager is that inept at inputting orders.\nThe java beach north of here is much better.

Weekend afternoons, especially Sunday and the first Wednesday of every month will be crowded.  Parking will be a pain in the a$$.  Parking should be fine every other day and time.

Besides the negative aspects of being at this cafe, I would like to move onto the food.\n\nBeing spoiled by the great sandwiches from Ike's place, I thought I might get a mediocre sandwich from Java Beach because it was close by.  I made a mistake... by ordering a toasted turkey sandwich and the crust came out as hard as a rock.  Taking a bite into the sandwich the crust crumbles into your mouth like a dust storm.  I ended up tossing the whole sandwich out.  Besides the sandwich, I believe that most of their food comes from Costco.  (Don't quote me on this.)\n\nI enjoy the fact that they have free Wifi, but there are always people at the cafe with their laptops setup.  You'll probably end up sitting outside.\n\nI like that they have a bar setup with some of my favorite beers on tap.\n\nTo recap, you can't go wrong if you order bottled drinks and some of the pastries behind the glass.

It seems like most of the patrons simply dropped off there kids and went some where else.  The staff seemed worn out on a Sunday after noon and they burned to a crisp my turkey and cheese croissants. One of the easiest meals to make on the planet.  BTW $2.35 for a brownie come on.  So if you enjoyed the Zoo stop by the kids circus that is Java Beach.", "author": "Dan K."}

This is a cafe\", wine bar, pub, restaurant, combined.\nAwesome view of the Ocean.  This is the best thing that has happened on this side of Taraval in a long time.  The staff was friendly, and efficient.\nGreat food, drinks, and great atmosphere.  A place like this has been long needed in this area.  Great Family environment. Kid Friendly...!!!", "author": "christianne c."}

Staff is friendly.  Breakfast croissants are good (favorite: turkey and cheese).  Oatmeal is good but not the best.  Several choices of coffees.  We bought some of their special blend whole bean coffee.  Wifi availlable and both times there were several people working at laptops.  Not a lot of seating space but it was warm enough to sit outside.", "author": "Patricia W."}

When I have the chance to support small businesses I do over Borders or Starbucks.  Java Beach is a good place to sit and watch people although it's less crowded on weekdays and the foggy days if you want some peace and quiet.  I like the whole wheat bagel with veggies and hummus; cookies taste a little too eggy; on warm days it's a great place to grab an IPA on tap.", "author": "Gina T."}

Especially nice the way they light the place up at night. Good sandwiches, I highly recommend the san something (petrino?) with chicken, cheese and avocado. Small, but quality list of beers on tap, and of course good coffee and pastries. I was a regular the first two weeks when the weather was awesome, not sure how the outdoor seating will fare in the upcoming cold and windy Sunset days. Staff is super-friendly (and a couple of the gals are pretty cute). All around a great place to grab coffee, beer, pastries or free WiFi.", "author": "Al K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-03", "description": "Being a coffee joint during the era of the Starbucks craze, Java Beach deserves some brownie points. It's location is pretty good.\n\nSeating Arrangement: The inside is very crowded, but maybe that's because I visited on (1) a hot day (2) at peak coffee/tea/frozen-yogurt hours (?). The outside is nice. That's basically it.\n\nMy Drink (White Mocha): Delicious! Nothing else to be said. Tasted like a white mocha from heaven. \n\nService: Spectacular. As I fill out numerous job applications for the summer, I notice each one mentions \"serving with a smile.\" As much as I hate that cliche, I actually faced a very pleasant woman who couldn't look any happier to be serving me. When the barista messed up and made a \"normal\" mocha for me instead, she immediately apologized and made my white mocha without any hesitation. However, it was still record time in my book. \n\nSo....4 Star. I'm not head-over-heels to run over there again, but it is definitely better than most coffee shops in the area. I hope to explore their other items next visit.", "author": "Danny D."}

Tullys is much cheaper and the workers are much friendlier.  They actually recognize me and get my order without me having to ask.  Now that's personal service.  I think the whole java beach scene is a bit mismanaged.  They always seem swamped and I guess the owners don't feel they need to hire anymore help.

I stumbled across this Java Beach Cafe place and was instantly drawn to the \"beachy\" feel that the restaurant gave me. Being from the Pacific Beach area of San Diego, the place reminded me a lot of some of the Cafe's down there...however, that is where the comparisons end. \n\nI have tried sandwichs from New York to Honolulu, and next to a certain Philly Cheese Steak at a sandwich shop called Italian Delight in Novato, this is without question the BEST sandwich for the price that I have ever had. The review that I read earlier about the bread crumbling like dust is rediculous. Melted in your mouth is more like it...The one qualm that I had was that it took like 20 minutes to get my sandwich, which was really bothering me at first, but once I bit into that sandwich, my buddy and I both agreed that the wait was well worth it. \n\nI live all the way in the Presidio, but you can bet that I am going to be heading back to Java Cafe in the not so distant future because it is so awesome. Trust me, you won't be disappointed!", "author": "J B."}

If you guys go here and see that dude making sandwiches, you have better order one and experience a deli made sandwich like never before!! Try the Tsunami for starters....I live only a few blocks away so I stroll over there from time to time to get me my coffee and sandwich when that dude is working....but seriously I don't swing that way I just love them sandwiches you make dogg!!!", "author": "dave s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-05-22", "description": "I love this place!  I have been going for coffee and their ham and cheese croisant sandwhich for years.  I like the music on Friday nights and on Sat and Sunday morning, there are tons of kids and dogs out front and sometimes a few stray surfers on their way in or out of the water which is across the street.  My favorite (sometimes salty) waitress always has a smile and she doesn't take any shit from the yuppy customers from Concord that have bad energy.  Its owned by an Irish guy and he hires kick ass Irish Broads that are straight up cool.  One day I was waiting for a friend to to go Stern Grove.  She was one hour late and this older guy chalked up conversation about the Giants and the next think I was on a Muni on my way to the game with him... the Muni goes straight from Java Beach to AT&T. Does it get any better? Come down and smile at the wicked Irish girl behind the counter...  Food is good but atmosphere is awesome!!", "author": "Jenna J."}

The only reason it does not have a full five stars is because I wish that there were some couches for me to TOTALLY lounge about on-  it would be COMPLETELY perfect then!  Where to start-  well, the staff is great!  Fantastic, friendly, fast customer service.  PLENTY of outlets for a nerd like me that likes to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at a cafe, work and do thesis writing from a cafe, since being at home makes me go stir-crazy.  Free Wi-Fi.  Super laid back attitude, not too many people, where you are panicking about getting a table, or freaks are going to steal your stuff.  All of the customers I have chatted with have been super cool, including my new bff that I met there, who I am going surfing with.  Oh, yeah, the location:  two blocks from the beach, so when the work is done, or if you need a break, just roll outside for a breather.  The food is great, AND they have beer!  I love this place!   For under $8, I got two beers for my friend and I, as  a reward for writing for three hours.  Hearts!", "author": "Jennifer O."}

It has a lot of things going for it, but at the same time, falls short onfriday/sat nights as their are lots of kids running around, locals and makes for nice vibe\ncons: overpriced, Costco pastries for $3+ is ridiculous; I also don't like their ordering system (you order/pay @ counter & you order/ticket is sent to the kitchen, and from there is a crapshoot, and your odds are not too good). Last nite I ordered soup, sandwich, beer and the sandwich never came, had to ask twice for it, 25 minutes later it came and all they could say is sorry (how about another beer, next latte on the house? nope...) On that note, I've never seen them giving a small handout to a patron in all of the time I've noticed them mess up an order. Go when it's not too busy, s*** is less likely to happen. Stay away from the pastries, soup, & other \"pre-prepared\" foods, on the other hand the coffee, sandwiches are  good. The place is clean, comfortable, well lit, wi-fi, and the employees there are pretty nice (which I can't say is always the case in SF establishments).", "author": "christian i."}
