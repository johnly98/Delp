If you are just looking for an decent place to eat hot pot without the hassle of lines or high prices, this should be your number 1 choice. Surprisingly, the high quality beef was actually high quality and the seafood was extremely fresh tasting. That being said though, this is a new establishment and the quality might not maintain itself as time goes on. Around 23$ per person is absolutely worth the quality and comfort of this hot pot experience.", "author": "Raymond F."}

So many ingredients- you basically can create any sauce you want. Minced garlic, peppers, creamy and clear sauces, etc. \n\nAs far as ingredients go, everything we had was fresh! I only dislike they stack meat plates on top of another, since I don't know how clean the bottom of their plates are. Each portion is well-controlled too; I never felt tired of eating the same order and had stomach left for other things.

It was super yummy.\n\nWe got a bunch of the sauces they made on the side. We tried it all but nothing stood out in taste.\n\nMy bf and I got the complimentary ice tea, which was good. \n\nThe very big downside was we weren't serviced well, and we also got bad bubble guts while we were eating. Maybe from the frequent putting in raw meat in the pot? We have had korean BBq and never had that problem. Maybe something wasn't sanitary, or meat wasnt good quality. There was also hair on the green onion pancake. We ate the ones without hair, and it was good. Such a shame. Maybe hot pot isn't my thing.....", "author": "Lynn C."}

The restaurant is much larger on the inside than the photos so don't let that discourage you from bringing the entire family for hot pot. They'll make your entire party fit if needed. \n\nAll you can eat hot pot is only available in the evenings starting at 5:30pm. If you get here right on the dot there will be no wait at all. Otherwise make sure you have reservations because the restaurant can get pretty busy as the night goes on. You order off a menu with a dry erase marker (so you can reuse this if you need to order more food). Their grand opening special includes milk tea! Be sure to take advantage of that with unlimited refills to boot. We ordered a ton of food and managed to finish it all without penalties. They warn that you will be charged for wasting food since it can't be re-served to other customers. Definitely load up on the American Wagyu beef and the lamb as it's super good. Their appetizers are also winners. Be sure to get the duck wings, Chinese fried donut, and the green onion pancake. \n\nDuring the day they have an a la carte menu and BBQ food to go if that's your thing.

Chef Li's Cafe's pricing is about as much as I expect any other hot pot restaurant to go for but the quality and diversity of ingredients probably makes it stand out a bit more. \n\nFor starters, the soup broths were pretty standard, you get one spicy one non-spicy (that my friends and I ultimately never eat out of so we always lament not getting full on spicy broths). Since this is ayce hot pot, you can go ham on the ingredients. Fish tofu, lamb, beef, napa cabbage, fish balls of every possible assortment, more tofu, enoki mushroom, and every noodle possible. The sauces are all self serve too and they also got a nice variety of sauces though the standard for me is satay, garlic, cilantro, some vinegar and an egg mixed in (it's a self-made concoction, not an available sauce). \n\nFor what you pay for, I'd say this is a decent hot pot spot that doesn't get crazy crowded.

Pretty good value considering it's AYCE that includes hot pot, milk teas, some appetizer/dim sum items. There are multiple flavors of milk tea like black, green, jasmine, etc. And they're not super sweet either, so I had the jasmine milk tea and it was pretty nice for cutting any spice. As for the dim sum items, we tried the mantou with condensed milk and roasted duck chin & wings. There are lots of soup bases to choose from and they have the split hot pot too. We tried the parsley with tofu & preserved egg plus the secret spicy soup bases. The secret spicy base wasn't that spicy. Sauces and condiments are in the back and there's a wide variety. They even have some housemade sauces like chili and satay. I loved the whole shrimps, clams, and mussels. OK breadth of seafood offerings. As for veggies, they were fresh and plentiful as well. The a choy, napa cabbage, watercress, eggplant, enkoi mushroom were all fresh and not wilted. Excellent meat and meatball options. I loved the egg and quail eggs, but even more they had several cuts of lamb and pork belly.

Though they need to work on sourcing better quality of ingredients.\n\nPRICE: AUCE hotpot with unlimited milk tea drinks is priced at $22.99, which is reasonable and average. \nPORTION: really small and inconsistent, which is okay since it's AYCE. An order or frozen tofu is 2 pieces, fish balls and quail eggs are 2-4 pieces. Meat rages from 4-6 pieces, vegetables on the other hand comes in a big basket. \nQuality: for the quality of food alone I'd give one star. Meat looks old or has been sitting out for a while. The fish balls with roe tasted synthetics and rotten. The milk teas are from powder mixes; it has no tea or milk. \nSERVICE: I spoke Chinese to the servers but I struggled to understand their english first.

I guess that's what makes it \"clear\"\n\nIt's fine, because they have all these awesome veggies like prefried yam and mushrooms that you can just put in the soup and cook your own soup.

They have a pretty large menu.  The atmosphere is pretty casual but they make excellent take out.  Really crazy affordable prices for San Francisco and good, authentic Chinese food.  Reasonable amount of oilyness (relative to other Chinese restaurants) and very generous portions.  My favorite dishes:\n\n- #123: Bean Curd Skin w/ Rock Cod and Roasted Pork - Wow. This dish is just all levels of deliciousness.  I mean, I love the chewiness of bean curd skin and I love fish casseroles (I use this word in the Chinese sense...more like stew).  They are generous with the amount of fish they give.  It also includes some other mixed veggies and wood ears (err...it's like a mushroom/fungus and it's chewy/crunchy if you're not familiar with it).  Best part is the savory roast pork that is also included.  Really, this is always a hit and a must-order!\n\n- #60: Beef Chow Foon - I always order this dish at Chinese restaurants to gauge quality.  They had a good level of oilyness--not too much to overpower the dish, but enough to keep the noodles separated.  Savory and plentiful.\n(We've also tried some other noodle dishes and have been satisfied with them all.)\n\n- #168 - Braised Tofu with Vegetables - Yummy dish and a nice way to get a variety of veggies in my diet!\n\nThey are really nice too...even if their English is sometimes limited.

I'm all for it! \n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant doesn't look like much and I would have never guessed that it was a hot pot restaurant but the inside is well lit and spacious. Nothing fancy about it but I always like places that have their burners inside the table and not on top. Some of the tables only had one burner for a shared pot and others had small burners for individual pots. I was surprised to see that there were 17 different broths to choose from! We opted for the pork bone and the special spicy soup. The pork bone broth had a funny smell and taste to it so it wasn't quite to my liking. I ended up cooking most of my food in that one anyway because the special spicy soup was wayyy too spicy and I felt like my lips were on fire throughout my meal - and this is coming from a spice lover. Just beware if you order it! \n\nThere's a wide variety of meat, vegetables, fish/meat balls, and noodles. The meats came out first and my favorite was the Kurobuta pork. The wagyu was alright but the Australian lamb was too chewy. We had already finished our first round of meat before the rest of our items came out. The meat portions were smaller than I would've liked and I guess they only let you order three at a time because they put them on a 3-tier rack. During the second round we ordered four meats and we were only given three. The second time we ordered the kurobuta pork all the pieces were super fat to the point we thought we ordered pork belly. Service was a bit too slow which made it harder for us to order more meat and they forgot a couple of items that we asked for. The food quality was overall okay, but since I didn't like the broths, it made the rest of the food a bit \"eh\". \n\nThere is a sauce bar in the back corner that has a lot of different sauces that you can mix together. I really enjoyed their house-made soy sauce! They also offer free milk tea (taro, Thai, regular, or jasmine) along with your meal and although that sounded like a great idea at first, I think it's a ploy to get you full faster off drinking their sweet milk tea, lol! (It's unlimited refills too) (I might be wrong) But I must admit it did compliment my meal well.

So much so that Yelp labeled it as the Excelsior...which is about 15 blocks away (they've since updated it). \n\nIt should come as no surprise that Portola is not a destination place when it comes to food.

By day, Chef Li's Cafe, is your standard Chinese restaurant with roasted ducks (looked bomb), soy sauce chicken, bbq pork, etc hanging at the window. You can also order the typical Chinese rice plates, noodle dishes, and clay pot items. By night, it's AYCE hot pot for $22.99 which includes apps (chicken wings, curry balls, five-spice beef shank), \"dim sum\" (pot stickers, green onion pancake, housemade dumplings), dessert (mantou), and milk tea: http://bit.ly/2tds5uK. Kids under 3 are free. Kids 10 and under are free. Seniors are $19.99. Reservations accepted.\n\nThey allowed for hot pot during lunch with reservations so we went during lunch time (same price as dinner). \n\nFor hot pot, you can choose individual pots or do half/half. They have 17 broths and all contain some msg. I told our server about my msg sensitivity and she kindly suggested the pork bone soup which has the least msg. We did a half/half pot with #1 Special Spicy Soup (mala) and #2 Pork Bone Soup: http://bit.ly/2sT731z and http://bit.ly/2tcOb0b. \n\n(+) Huge variety of hot pot items (check off on a list): meats, offal, seafood, seafood & meat balls, dumplings, several tofu varieties, veggies and mushrooms, noodles, rice cakes, etc. \n(+) Meats were super fresh and pretty good quality for the price. Fav: New Zealand Lamb and American Wagyu (limit 1 plate pp). \n(+) Loved the beef tongue...they pre-cook it so it's super soft. \n(+) Housemade shrimp wonton was packed with fresh, crunchy shrimp. \n(+)  Light msg usage for the Pork Bone Soup. No cotton ball mouth afterwards.\n(+) The mala broth had good numbing flavor but I could taste the msg. If I didn't have my stupid msg sensitives, I would have enjoyed this one. My sister liked it. \n(+) Sauce bar with a good variety of sauces include beef drippings and raw egg: http://bit.ly/2tdZlCk. If you're sensitive to msg like myself stick with the peanut butter, chili oil, sriracha, cilantro, jalapeno. \n(+) Fried mantou (made to order) with condensed milk was the perfect ending to this meatfest: http://bit.ly/2tdQxMA.\n\n(-) We ordered some items that never came; e.g. duck tongue.  \n(-) Housemade shrimp paste had a weird, mushy texture. \n(-) Fish ball with fish roe had no fish roe filling.  \n(-) The beef balls had a strange elastic texture. \n(-) Milk tea was pre-made in a pitcher and tasted from the powder variety. \n(-) No booze. \n\nThe fine print: 90 minute limit (+$10 for each 30 minutes thereafter), $20 pp charge for uneaten food, 1 credit card per a table. \n\nThe servers were really nice and attentive which is a rarity for a Chinese restaurant. They even offered to make us some special sauces from the sauce bar. The call their male customers \"handsome\" in Cantonese which I thought was cute. I didn't want to be Captain Obvious and do a 180 to see if they were really cute. Though, I totally would have after couple of shots. \n\nChef Li's Cafe is bright and pretty spacious (I think this used to be a copy shop?). There's about 10-12 two and four tops, and 2 six tops.

Do not be fooled by the looks of this restaurant even though it looks a bit janky. \n\nI wanna start off with a quick story before going on with this review -- My friends and I had decided eat here for the first time as it is still fairly new, also with it being 'Buffet Style Hot Pot'....which I did not pay attention to. As it was time to give our order, plates and plates of Hot Pot components kept getting served to us....and my friends still wanted more. Therefore, they ordered 5 more plates of meat, which to mention, we had gone through 10 plates. I started freaking out because I thought the total of our Bill was going to be SKY HIGH expensive but then...I realized it was BUFFET STYLE. AHHH THE IDEA OF BUFFET STYLE HOTPOT IS A YESSS LOL.\n\nOnto the review -- When you first walk in, you have to wait to be seated. I would say that it doesnt get too packed, however, the moment you are seated and eating, you'll begin to realize (most times) that the tables start to get filled up as time passes by. You will have stoves infront of you that you can control with a 1-5 setting heat (1 being the lowest of heat whereas 5 is boiling heat). \n\nThe waitors give 1 menu per table, and the idea is to just mark off the quantity of what toppings and components you want, however, each person gives their own order of what Soup Base they want.You also can get FREE COMPLIMENTARY_FREE REFILL HOUSE MILK TEA :).There are about 5 different flavors and the Milk Teas have the perfect amount of sweetness/ are rich and creamy. How can I not ask for another refill?\nMInd you, take advantage of the fact that this is an ALL YOU CAN EAT BUFFET STYLE HOT POT only for $22.99 per person. That is so cheap considering you can keep ordering A BUNCH  of plates to satisfy your hunger or cravings. \n\n***Now for the Cons: The reason why this review did not get a full 5 Star rating considering it seemed that I was leading towards a 5 star review......the service.\n\nThe staff are definitely polite and friendly, however, their service could be better. \n\nWhenever we needed more orders, of course we were patient, however, every time we raise our hand or show some sort of gesture to get their attention.....the staff are just not with it and can be slow. \n\nAnother downside is, the staff seems to primarily speak and understand Chinese...therefore It honestly was a struggle to ask for certain things or requests aside from them just having to look at our menu to see what we wanted. \n\nWhat threw me off BIG TIME was my friend asked for water, and we expected a new fresh cup just like any other restaurant would if we had already used the cup with another drink. The lady just decided to pour the water into the cup we had already used, which was filled with Milk Tea......we asked for another Cup and she said we could not have one. Quite upsetting actually now that I look back on it.  \n\nI honestly would still recommend this place. You definitely will get your money's worth.", "author": "Stacey M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-26", "description": "Review is only for the \"all you can eat buffet\" element of this restaurant.  I cannot speak upon anything beyond that.  The following is just my opinion, and that's exactly all it is.  It's not right, nor is it wrong.  Just my opinion.\n\nI really wanted to like this place.  I really, really did.  \n\nFirst thing to note: according to their policy, you only get 90 minutes for the \"all you can eat\".  Think about that for a minute.\n\nSecond note: came here on the weekend.  We were very much excited to try Chef Li's and got there a little bit after the buffet began.  Got a seat right away as there was not a whole lot of people there yet.  We got the menu and began our selections.  Round one was about to commence!  Got our milk teas right away, but the first round of food took a little bit to come out, and missed a few items that we ordered.  \n\nAs we began eating, crowds started to come into the restaurant and it was noticeably busier.  One thing we observed was that at the time, there were really only 2 individuals helping everyone with the service.  An additional employee was behind the counter handling the checkout process.  The thing about an \"all you can eat\" buffet is that service is constantly needed at various tables for various reasons, but that definitely was not happening since they obviously were short staffed.  We were almost done with round 1, and wanted to begin ordering for round 2.  \n\nAfter some wait, and pondering whether we were able to use some kind of dance to attract her attention, the waitress came back with the menu for round 2 and uttered something in the lines of \"you might want to get everything now\".  We started to realize that this is truly not an \"all you can eat\" buffet because we were really under a lot of pressure from time constraints and not only that, limited servicing.  Round 2 took extremely long to get out, and again missed a few items we ordered.  The most surprising part (which was also the most disappointing), is that it took us an immensely long time to get a second round of milk teas (which we ordered on the menu).  It wasn't until a third employee came on the floor that we were able to get that second round.  \n\nNow, onto the quality of the food.  All the seafood is pretty standard, but it was the meat that shocked me the most.  The meats were really not all that great (in my opinion), and quite frankly all tasted the same.  There was this interesting taste to them, that I cannot pinpoint exactly what it is.  The broth was sub par, but the noodles (which for some odd reason took an hour to come out, and two order tries) were solid.  My favorite part of the meal were the milk teas.  That was truly the most on point item they had.  \n\nWould I go there again?  Not really.  For $23+ dollars, I can honestly say I did not get my money's worth.  I can only presume certain things about this place, and I will keep that to myself.  However, if you're looking to roll the dice, you may want to give it a try.", "author": "Bernie C."}

Literally 2 walking blocks from my house. I can see crowds of people here once they see the $22.99 AYCE option! I have been to a good amount of AYCE hot pot places before--there are good and bad ones. This one is actually GREAT for the price. Meat quality is definitely freshly sliced to order. We had plenty orders of beef (rib eye & wagyu), lamb, and pork! They also have appetizers--really enjoyed the green onion pancake and the fried buns with condensed milk OMG! I also loved the cold tripe plate, reminds of the szechuan cold app dishes- must order!\n\nBroths that I liked was the spicy miso--has a good kick. Good for those who can do spicy but not too spicy. Tom Yum was delicious as well. If you don't like spicy the pork bone broths they offered were pretty flavorful!\n\nThere is also a sauce bar-I recommend using beef juice and beef sauce with spicy sauce and drizzle of the peanut sauce that's light brown along with garlic, scallions, green onions, and cilantro BOMB. They take 4 hours to make their own sauces at the bar so definitely check it out! i will be back soon!", "author": "Alice Z."}

The first time was pretty upsetting, because I was the only table available and I still couldn't get my food in a timely manner. However, it was close to closing time so I thought that maybe I'd give them a chance at an earlier time.\n\nBig mistake. Though the restaurant was fuller, the service  was not much different than the first time. This place is a hotpot place so you order what you want on a menu and it comes out for you to cook. However, out of the three times we ordered, my friend and I only received half the items. We thought maybe they ran out of items? It would have still been nice to know.\n\nNext, our food items came very sparsely in some areas and abundant in others. We got the end parts of noodles and our meat came out in small pieces of six, but they gave an excess of veggies and deep fried foods to the point where we couldn't finish them. They also started running out of food at 8pm, two hours before closing. Their sauce bar was not correctly labeled so it was confusing to make sauces. It was overall a mess. They also took 10-15 minutes to come out with food and they never checked up on our table unless we asked.\n\nHowever, parking is never hard (+1) and their milk tea is also unlimited and delicious (+1). However, their bubble milk tea ran out by the time we got there (7pm).\n\nOverall, I wouldn't come back. I'd much rather spend my money on a place where I can receive my food in a timely manner with all the food I ordered. A meal that takes an hour took us about two hours due to slow service.", "author": "Hannah C."}

It was pretty cheap since it was all you can eat for $22.99/person and milk tea included! They have 17 different flavors, I chose secret spicy soup and special curry soup. Both of the broths were okay, it wasn't that flavorful. I wish their secret spicy soup was actually spicier. I ordered 3 plates of New Zealand Lamb, 3 plates of American Wagyu Beef, 1 plate of beef rib eye, 1 plate of house special spicy lamb, and 1 plate of house special spicy beef. \n\nThe New Zealand Lamb and Wagyu beef tasted nearly the same..  It wasn't bad but I didn't see anything special between them. \n\nBeef rib eye just tasted like every other beef. \n\nOkay, now the house special spicy lamb and spicy beef weren't spicy at all.

Because this restaurant has a more mom & pop vibe and isn't overrated with a bunch of hype, it felt like I was more supporting a local business than one of those popular must-try hot pot places in the city. For $23 before tax & tip you have a wide selection of broths to choose from, meats, vegetables, dumplings, noodles and all you can drink milk tea (say what?) \n\nMy sister and I had a date here on a Friday night where there was no crowds or anything and we were looking forward to eating a good meal together. We were seated at a 4 person table with their own burner so instead of us being able to get a split broth pot, we instead got our own broth pot and got to try each others. After reading reviews, I chose the pork bone broth and my sister got the tom yum. I would totally recommend the pork bone broth! It was super soothing for a cold day. We ordered a LOT of food; I would recommend getting the new zealand lamb & wagyu beef for sure and any of their housemade dumplings. Everything else like the veggies and noodles are pretty standard and are usually offered at other hotpot restaurants. They have a DIY sauce bar and even an option to dump an egg into your soup! The milk tea is pretty good however it tasted more like using the powder mixture rather than using real tea leaves.\n\nDownsides of this place: the service isn't the best, as we saw about two waitresses running around to all the tables even when the place wasn't overly crowded. We had to flag them down to get our orders in. As I requested certain items (i.e. the bok choy), they substituted for another item without letting us know they ran out; it wasn't until I mentioned it to them that they told me they didn't have anymore so they decided to give us something else. For the most part despite the downsides, I think this place is good to get your AYCE  hotpot fix at a reasonable price.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

We had to circle a few times and park a few blocks away. \n\nTip #2: There's a massive sauce bar where you can compose your own sauce masterpiece.

Like Ariel stated the menu (with broths) are very similar to iPot. Also,  note that there is only hot pot, and the wagyu you can get is limited. The nice thing about it is that it is affordable, and the portions are consistent. At other hot pot places, I never know the sizing of the portions, so I never know how much to actually order. With Chef Li's, they  use the same plates for all the meats, so you know portioning is consistent. They do mostly offer hot pot at dinner, but if you call ahead of time and ask, they will allow you to eat it at lunch. They also take reservations, as long as you call in. However, only a couple of serves speak fluent English, so you're better off here if you can speak Cantonese or Mandarin. Many of the customers here also spoke Cantonese or Mandarin so it was legit. You can split broths as well-- and they have like 12 varietals of broth you can choose from. Meat quality is thawed or fresh, not frozen, which was awesome, and there was a whole ton of meat you could choose from. Our favorites were the wagyu beef, kurobuta pork belly, and the lamb! \n\nOn our lunch visit, we got half spicy mala broth (which wasn't SUPER spicy-- but I'm sure you could ask them to make it that way if you wanted) and half miso broth. Both were excellent, and yes, they do refill, even without you asking! While they say there is a time limit, it was not strictly enforced during lunch-- though dinner may be different. Service is hit or miss, as they are super busy and like I said, the language barrier may be difficult for people who want someone who is super attentive, but for the most part, it's standard hot pot service. The sauce bar is also super dope and have cool sauces like beef juice (au jus drippings, I guess) as well as housemade spicy sauce (delicious! my favorite seriously) and housemade mushroom sauce. The sauce bar alone is a reason I'd recommend it. The milk tea is also worth it ,though the stock pictures show that they come with boba, and they definitely don't.

With that being said, Frank and I decided to try Chef Li's Cafe in San Bruno because it was 6 PM on a Sunday night and we did not want to wait 2 hours to be seated and then get home late because we both have work tomorrow. In my opinion, San Bruno or Daly City falls to be my go-to areas to look for food when I want to avoid the lines and waitlist. With that being said, we arrived at the location around 6:30 PM and was seated about 5 minutes after (they took some time to clean up a table for us). \n\nThis place seems to have everything from your roasted meat and poultry to family style dinner and all you can eat hot pot. Frank and I opted in for the all you can eat hot pot because Frank wanted something with a lot of meat, whereas I was craving soup (a nice win for the both of us)! The place have about 8-10 small tables and 3-4 large tables that can seat about 6-10 people. Each table have the hot pot system installed. I would say, with the installation, the tables become rather thick, therefore, for tall people, you might run into the problem where the table becomes too low for you and would touch your knees. I ran into the problem where I could not cross my legs because the table was low (and I'm only 5'2\". The place was bright and looks clean. Upon receiving our menu, we were told that we are getting complimentary bubble tea options of our choice (milk tea, or Thai tea). I assume this is a promotional add on for their grand opening. \n\nI don't know whether the hosts and waiters saw Frank and I as Asians and just assumed we spoke Chinese or if they did not know English (the waiters) but they kept speaking Chinese to us even after we told them that we do not speak Chinese. The host spoke limited Chinese, which was fine for us to order and get our food and check. \n\nThe all you can eat hot pot is 22.99 per person (which is about average around the area). There is a big selection of what is included from (lamb, beef, pork, chicken, clams, mussels, shrimp, fish and meatballs) similar to other hot pot location. I would say though that they have a quite a big selection of soup base that you can choose from and appetizer and dim sum is included in the all you can eat (most locations do not include appetizer or even dim sum).\n\nFor appetizer, I got the chicken wings as I love wings and can't live without them. The wings were called 5-spice wings but really tasted like salt, pepper and other light seasoning and then fried. The wings were good but they did not taste like 5-spice wings in my opinion. \n\nFor the hotpot, we got spicy miso soup and kimchi soup. The spicy miso tasted like the Chinese spicy soup mixed with Miso and the kimchi tasted like Chinese spicy soup with kimchi. It was still good but definitely not what I expected for each type of soup. As for the meat, we went with the wagyu beef, spicy lamb, spicy beef, beef tripe, beef tongue, quail eggs, spicy fish filet, New Zealand Mussels, Clams, cuttlefish balls and beef balls. We got a few vegetable as well to justify our healthy choices (watercress, boy choy and mushrooms). Everything we ordered was great and it was relatively fresh. The spicy lamb was surprisingly good as I am a bit skeptical at times when lamb is prepared for an all you can eat place as they tend to still have a smell attached to them. The spicy lamb did not have the bad smell attached to them at all and was pretty good. The seafood was pretty good, it wasn't fresh out of the sea but it wasn't frozen to the point where you can tell by tasting it that it has been frozen forever. \n\nI would definitely come back to this place for their hot pot and maybe try their barbecue section next time as well. I love the fact that there was practically no wait to get a table for hot pot unlike in the city where you could be waiting for an hour or two at a hot pot place that have about 20+ tables. This place is also great for accommodating larger parties as well and it seemed like there is not a big wait to accommodate large parties. I would say, if this place have grill and hot pot, it would be one of my go to spot for hot pot and grill for the no wait and decent food.\n\nI give this place a 3.5 out of 5 because the variety is amazing here, especially if you were to come with a lot of people that have different Chinese food cravings. The service is ok, but I wished they have more English speaking servers. The food was good based but basically what you can get in most hot pot places. The value was definitely there for the hot pot though because you pay $23 a person to get hot pot, appetizer and dim sum, which is more selection that I expected and the price was pretty average.", "author": "Chenny O."}

I'm not sure if its the same owner, if it's not, there's probably a lawsuit on the way lol. The menu is exactly the same! A few differences, the price is lower here, 22.99 for ayce, milk tea is included (regular, jasmine, taro), and there is no half pot half grill option, instead of ice cream they give you a popsicle at the end. The meat quality was good and the service was decent, I will admit the service is a little slower here vs. iPot, there are only 1.5 servers currently. We came at an odd hour for lunch/dinner so the service was not too bad and we got our meat in a reasonable time. \n\nOverall, if you don't want to wait for a table at iPot and don't mind not having grilled meat, I recommend coming here.", "author": "Ariel N."}

There were many options to choose from with regards to broth. The four broths my friends and I got were: Spicy Miso, Tom Yum, Pork Bone, and Salty Pork Bone with Winter Melon. Out of these broths, I really enjoyed the Tom Yum. Not too spicy and not too sour, this broth brought all of the food I cooked inside to a whole new level. The menu itself was extremely extensive. If you're a fan of variety, you have to check this place out! Besides the countless kinds of meats, tofus, vegetables, fish/beef balls, and noodles they offered, their appetizer list (which is also AYCE) was amazing as well. \n\nHIGHLIGHTS: exceptional meat quality (lamb was my favorite), very tasty appetizers (5-spice chicken wings and potstickers were my favorite), SAUCE BAR\n\nThe sauce bar deserves its own section in this review. I always look forwards to customizing my own sauces at hot pot restaurants and when I saw this sauce bar, I was instantly impressed. Not only does this sauce bar have your traditional selections (peanut sauce, sesame sauce, bean curd, soy sauce, scallions, garlic, etc.) but there are also many selections which were created by the main chef. These customized sauces included: a mushroom paste sauce (my favorite), a special spicy sauce, and a beef broth sauce.\n\nService is typically not great at AYCE hot pot restaurants so I do want to point out that the service here was phenomenal! The waitresses were attentive and friendly, and always making sure we had everything we needed. One of the chefs even came out to double check on us to make sure we were not only enjoying our food but having a great time doing so. Nice touch!", "author": "Jason T."}

Any day for shabu hot pot is a yass in sf... \n.\nSo i called ahead and asked if they offer it during lunch and she confirmed it yes! Next was on a mission to here with the awkward lyft driver. \n.\nAs soon as i step my foot in here i was like I'm hungry.... sat me down at a table. All tables were for 4 and have a individual stove on there. The tables were kind of uncomfortable for the leg space and room, due to the table frame. \n.\nThey give you a erasable laminated menu with dry erase pen. If only one person you get one broth and a small bowl. If 2 person you get bigger bowl with 2 broth to choose. \n.\nThey have a big section for veggies, spinach, a choy, tong choy, lettuce, and etc. Perfect for vegans and vegetarian. \n.\nMeat section they have lamb, beef, and etc. But i find it a bit thick cut to shabu. I also discovered that the the spicy lamb and spicy beef was a thinner cut, so i ordered that over and over. \n.\nThey had a variety of miscellaneous items such as dim sum and i just skipped that since it was only me eating. Also can't forget all them pork, beef, fish, meatballs with or without fillings in them. As well tripe and all the nasty bits they offer too. \n.\nThe hot pot soup i chose was tom yum thai soup. The flavor wasnt all there. Wasnt hot or sour. The owner apologized that they were short handed and she made it. Everything else was good. \n.\nI also like the sauce station for you to make your own shabu sauce and because gotta keep it saucy. They offered ginger scallion, soy sauce, peanut butter, mushroom sauce, beef soy sauce, seaseme oil, and etc. I find that most of the sauces were thick in a paste like so you will have to mix it all with soy sauce to thin the sauce out. \n.\nOverall i had a great experience. Surprisingly the server was very nice and polite. She kept busy and was on her toes to bring me stuff. They are short staffed and still improving so it was good for 1st time. As well the buffet hot pot was only 22.99 which was reasonable.  Also comes with 5 different choices of milk tea on the house with the buffet. But mines never came, but it was ok.

We had steamed pork, fish fillet with green beans, and \"Choi sum\" - very fresh vegetables and ingredients.  They even have congee!  I haven't been to a Chinese restaurant that offers such a great variety on the menu. Perfect for casual dinners.", "author": "Portia C."}

What a great addition to downtown Portola (San Bruno Av.). All ingredients were very good - great selections of meat, seafood and veggies, all fresh, we got 2 types of broths: Spicy Mayo and Pork Bone. Both were very good. Service was excellent. Will definitely go back and bring friends with us.", "author": "Joanna L."}

Ducks and pork hang in the window, however, Chef Li's is on another level.  It's simply the best Chinese BBQ I've had in SF.  The duck was melt-in-your mouth tender, and the pork was perfectly seasoned.  This is what Chinese BBQ is supposed to be.", "author": "Aneil M."}

All you can eat hot pot is $23 per person with two people it will come out to about $58 with tax and tip. We told them it was our first time there and the waitresses were helpful showing us the menu and how to order. Step 1 choose a milk tea their free milk tea options are jasmine green, thai tea, black tea, and two others I can't remember. They do not include the tapioca balls just the milk tea. Step 2 choose the type of broth you would like my brother got the spicy broth the first one and I tried the thai thom ka spicy broth which was way spicier than the spicy broth. There are about 17 options of broth. Step 3 after choosing the broth you can take some time to look over the meats, veggies, tofu, appetizers, and dim sum options. You will mark down on the menu with an expo marker what you would like and how many servings of each you would like. If you want to try a lot of items mark down a 1 so you won't get super full on a couple of items. If you know that everyone at your party really wants a whole plateful of one of the items mark the number of people at your table. Once you are done marking your waitress will pick up the menu and hand it over to the kitchen. In the meantime you will have milk tea to sip on and your hot pot broth will be brought over to boil. There are 5 heat levels that you can turn with the knob. Once your hot pot is boiling we found setting 2 or 3 to be the most comfortable. Step 4 pick out herbs, toppings, and sauces for your hot pot. I tried the satay sauce super yummy and the peanut sauce which was just okay. I also picked up cilantro, green onions, and garlic. My brother added more chili sauce to his hotpot but mine was plenty spicy. Step 5 Then your first order comes out and you can go crazy! If you finish your first order and want more food you can order more rounds as hotpot is all you can eat. You can also order the appetizers and dim sum we tried the tripe and dumplings. For the meats we tried lamb, waygu beef, fish fillet, shrimp, rib eye, pork belly, and squid. For the veggies we tried the napa cabbage, mushrooms, bok choy, squash, winter melon, broccoli, and probably more. They give you a lot of each so we enjoyed ordering one serving and splitting to have more variety. We went through the first round and decided to order a few more things. It is important to pace yourself. The ladies brought by napkins and took away plates efficiently overall a great experience.", "author": "Lauren R."}
