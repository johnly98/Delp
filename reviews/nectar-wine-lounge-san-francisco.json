We got in right around 645, and there was plenty of open seats to snag up. Sat at the bar top and the owner/bartender was very friendly. \n\nAlthough we weren't that hungry, we saw truffle popcorn, and just had to! Plus, the mac n cheese. Bacon on the side. He laughed at us when I said no bacon and my friend screamed yes, bacon! On the side. Eye roll at me. Haha. Mac n cheese was watery looking at first, but def tasted a whole lot better than it looked! As for the popcorn, it was a bit stale, with little truffle taste (tbh, still prefer the bar popcorn at The Evil Eye in outer mission). \n\nAs for the drinks, friend went w a Pinot. Not typically a red person myself, but it was great. Full bodied, w tons of flavor. As for me, I got the vermentino. LOVE a great vermentino, and haven't been able to find a great one since leaving Italy...but this one they have here has to be one of the best ones I've had back in the states! Believe the owner/bartender told me this one they had in stock was from the South of France. \n\nAll in all, a great experience.

The owners and staff pick excellent wines for all palates and they will ask you questions about what you like or have liked in the past to make their recommendations. \n\nChris, Leila, and staff cool-guy Jack will give you something that you like or with me they challenged me - opened me up to new and exciting wines that I hadn't tried or had a firm opinion against. Specifically, they don't only buy wines they like but pick for everyone's palate - this is what makes an Award Winning Wine list. I've been given several Grand Awards and their list is on par with those lists - cover the spectrum. Everything I tasted was well structured and beautiful. \n\nI've been here a few times and absolutely LOVE, LOVE, LOVED it!! Pardon me but I was too lazy to write a proper review last time. My good friend Bob turned me on to these guys and he's a Wine Bar specialist. This last time we came over after dinner and tasted some really beautiful wines - both white, and red. \n\nI've been anti-German/NZ Pinot forever and Chris brought out a bottle of German Pinot Noir that was excellent. I might say this is one of the rare German Pinot's that taste this good. As an expert in his business - he explained to me that the owner started these wines from Northern Burgundy (Best Pinot's in the world) graftings - so he took root stock from the Cote de Nuit area of France and drove them to his winery house in Germany and grew them and is now making amazing wines. \n\nChris and Leila also turned me onto a Cremant (like a Champagne) that I'm absolutely in love with and can't get enough. I'm not big on sparkling wines unless they're the best - and for a small price this is in that category for me. Pictures attached of these wines that I highly recommend to anyone that love complex tasty wines. Also have a menu for snacks, cheese, and charcuterie or salumi as some say. \n\nGo and talk to them - they all know their product really well and will expand your palate or give you exactly what you want to make your evening...........or day if you're a daytime drinker.", "author": "Rew C."}

They also had a movie projected onto the wall, although they were playing Jaws which didn't seem to fit the ambiance very well LOL.\n\nI got the bad ass red flight, which was 3 3oz glasses for $18 - seemed pretty pricey (at least compared to beer flights) but then again wine is usually not cheap anyways. The Italian and French wines had similarly tart flavors, while the Spanish one was sweeter and fruitier which I liked better. My friend who ordered the bubbly flight enjoyed that, and there were also pinot noir and white wine flights.\n\nIt wasn't super crowded when we went around 930pm, so this seems like a nice place to go if you're looking for a chill night.

What better way to spend 30 minutes before dinner?\n\nWe took a seat at the bar and were immediately greeted, but not bombarded, which is always appreciated. It's gorgeous inside; dim lighting, dark furniture, beautiful shelves full of beautiful wine, candlelight...

But, of course, their menus are just incredible! This is my kind of food, y'all. I didn't eat a meal here, unfortunately, but I drooled over their menu for far too long. French, Spanish, local, and Irish cheese, butternut squash pizzetta, burrata with prosciutto, garden flatbread, baked polenta... it's a seasonal menu full of fresh and local ingredients, and each dish has a recommended wine listed beside it. For starters, they have roasted olives, bacon wrapped dates, and black truffle popcorn. Oh my gods... the popcorn. I had to have it, even though I was about to head to dinner. Best popcorn I've ever eaten, you guys. Perfectly popped, beautifully light, and perfectly, delicately enhanced with truffle. $7 for a large enough portion to share? Amazing!\n\nI apologize for getting this far into a wine lounge review without mentioning the wine, which was fantastic. I went with a prosecco, of course.

The first thing I noticed was that the menu was short, very short. The wine list was by far the longest part of it (duh) and capped out at around a dozen wines. The food was a total of six or so dishes (not counting the appetizers/happy hour snacks) and three deserts. \nMy wife and I came here for a quick dinner on our way to the airport, and were very pleased. First, the one Sauvignon Blanc (from Australia or New Zealand, I can't remember which) on the list was spectacular - an explosive yet balanced first taste with a delicious lingering finish. It probably should have been paired with some of the excellent looking chocolate desserts.\nSecond, I was very pleased with my German Lager. Outstanding without being distracting, perfect to complement and offset a warm but stressful evening.\n\nStressful, that brings me to one glaring caveat: The parking. Locals will know that the area this is in is godawful for parking, visitors will not. A cross between massively busy and densely residential/popular. Scouring a ten block square for a single open space did not start out my evening well. \nHowever, that means even more bonus points to Nectar for making it all worth it! The friendly staff helped a lot, and the quality of food/drink and the relaxing ambiance tipped the scale into a great dinner.\n\nThe arugula salad was amazing (tart, great mixture of ingredients, served as a mighty pile of greens), and the Mac & Cheese was absolutely mind-blowing! It's plenty for one person, and was enough for us to split, and my god is it good! It's a perfect crumbly baked cheese/bread crumb crust that crumbles right through, so it adds texture without keeping a seeking fork from getting to the juicy, steaming, cheesy goodness below.\n\n...I am going to get some food now, I can't write that without drooling.

I am so glad I liked this place because now I have to come back to use my $20. \n\nAnyway, I came here with a friend for happy hour before our dinner reservation at Isa next door. I really liked the ambience of the place; pretty spacious, with bar stools and high, long tables toward the back and a comfy lounge area in the front. Service was OK; we had to try really hard to get their attention a couple of times and they weren't super friendly but whatever. Their happy hour is pretty good: 30% of wines and their food all sounded really good! We just ordered the truffle popcorn because we didn't want to get too full before dinner, but that was amazing! Also ordered 2 glasses of wine, both good. I do recommend this place if you're looking for a nice wine bar/happy hour spot.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

My boyfriend and I came directly from the Giants game and we're hoping to get a nice glass of wine and one of the desserts before walking home. We thought since it was later in the evening and no one else was eating, the kitchen was closed. However, our sweet tooth got the best of us and we had to ask. The gentleman didn't even hesitate and said he would absolutely check for us. Long story shorter, we ended up enjoying a delicious dessert, fabulous wine and unbelievable service!

They allowed us to bring small decor items (the space is charming as is), which they used to make the space extra special for us. They held our cake in their wine cellar and cut it for us for a modest fee per slice. They moved the furniture so we could have a small dance floor at the front. Acted as our DJs by lowering and turning up the music when appropriate. We met a week before the reception to taste the wines we wanted to serve (the fun part).

Their space isn't very large, nor is it cramped by SF standards, but come early to secure a seat. \n\nWine flights are the way to go -- they have the abc (anything but chard flight), a bad assed red flight and bubbly flight, priced between $15-$17 for three tastes. Interesting varietals with over the top descriptions will surely pique your curiosity. Here's an example of a sparkling wine description: \"frozen bomb boysenberry jam explodes on the palate with a fizzy whoosh of eucalyptus leaves & a hard shwack of leather that lets you know that uncle dick isn't kidding\".  If that doesn't put a smile on your face, then you should order a bubbly. \n\nThey also have a happy hour menu for apps priced between $3-$8.

Movies play silently projected on the wall, while good jams provide a relaxed but vibrant atmosphere. \n\nThere are 2 tables outside that catch some evening sun if its a nice day. If not, head inside to relax on one of the couches or sit at the bar to brush up on your wine skills chatting with the wine experts. \n\nYou can also buy all the wines here at a very reasonable price. So if you find something you really like, stock up. \n\nHappy Hour is the time to go, all wines 50% off by the glass, plus deals on food.", "author": "Carlynn A."}

My husband & I sat on a couch by the window and watched people walk by, enjoying the sunny afternoon in the Marina - great location and very relaxing!\n\nWe ordered the Flight of 3 Nectars which were so delicious and refreshing! The Pink Pearl was our favorite but the others were a close second. We ordered the Breakfast Pizzetta and the Frittata, based on the manager's recommendation and it was quite possibly the best frittata we've ever had!

We tried the homemade vegan juice bread - which was amazing! We also split the arugula salad, frittata (which was small, but delicious) and the breakfast pizza. The breakfast pizza was one of the best I've ever had!

Evidently he had, at one point, worked with the proprietor, and since the sun was going down and the temperature dropping and he wasn't yet ready to start ignoring me for months at a time, he suggested that we go wine tasting together. \n\nIt was a Friday evening, around 5:30 when we arrived. I followed him in, and he walked straight up to the bar as though he owned the place, waiting for the sommelier to acknowledge him. Once he did, my date was greeted with a grin and a handshake and we were immediately shown to a table with oversized relaxed chairs and handed menus. I was introduced to our sommelier (I'm going to call him Chris, although I might be making this name up) as a winemaking student and friend and I awkwardly listened to their conversation for a moment until Chris left to attend to other patrons. I was asked if I would like to do a flight, and I happily accepted. \n\nPerusing the list, I found a number of wines with which I wasn't overly familiar from a variety of international wine regions. I quickly picked out the flight from the languedoc region of France and sipped on my bubbly while the darling ex studied the wine list. \n\nOur wine-pouring friend returned and asked if we had made decisions, and my date said \"Why yes, we're going to do flights and I'm going to have...\" at which point Chris interrupted him \"May I suggest you try the languedoc flight?\" at which point we agreed and he headed off to pour our glasses. Not long after, he returned with our flights and a map depicting the regions and describing the wines we would be tasting. \n\nA few moments of awkward wine sniffing later and we tasted the wines. Unique, each of them, but I wasn't highly impressed by any. We took our time drinking through the three glasses and, before long, nature was calling and it became apparent to me that I hadn't eaten a proper meal yet that day. Gracefully stumbling to a restroom in a classy setting such as this takes great amounts of concentration. Next time, remember to clear the table before you move forward. Their furniture is sturdy and difficult to upset: Score! \n\nUpon my return, the ex had decided yet another glass of wine was necessary and we ordered snifters full of pinot noir (I expect they were particularly generous pours from Chris who thought he was getting an old friend some action) which was, actually, quite impressive to me. We chatted through the last glass and left sometime around 7:30. Despite the fact that the wine bar was filling up and we were taking up space and not ordering food, we weren't rushed and received attentive service. \n\nAn enjoyable experience and pleasant wines.

From the moment we sat down, the service was off and seemed to get worse throughout the night.  We were greeted by server, Silkie (Short blonde hair with tattoos.  Perhaps, she is relatively new?) and politely told her that we wanted to wait for my husband to arrive before we ordered.  We also mentioned that some of us had purchased the Yelp deal to which she answered \"I'm glad you told me now because I hate when customers tell me they purchased the deal after I've already brought them the receipt.  I then have to go back and update the receipt and bring them a new one.\"  We felt that was a little odd to say but decided to ignore it.  \n\nWhen we were ready to pay for our check, the other server came by and we told her that two of us had purchased the Yelp deal.  She mentioned that we could only use one.  So we said didn't know that since we were planning on splitting the bill.  The server then said she would call the owner, Chris over to explain.  While we waited for Chris, our original server, Silkie came by and said \"You only said you had a Yelp deal.  You didn't say you had two\" in a nasty voice while pointing her finger at us.  So then we responded by saying that we didn't appreciate her attitude and would prefer to speak to Chris about this instead.  Silkie continued to badger us so we finally said that as a server she should have a better attitude and be more polite towards customers.  Silkie seemed to be in shock that she was a server because her response was \"Really?  I'm a server?!\".  Yes, you are a server and are there to provide us customers a service.  If you don't like that then you're in the wrong industry.\n\nThe owner, Chris then came by to discuss what happened.  He was very apologetic and seemed embarrassed by what happened, and did make up for it.  And just to note, not being able to use our second Yelp deal wasn't what upset us (we don't really care about the $10 or $20 savings).  What upset us was Silkie's unprofessionalism and rudeness.  \n\nNeedless to say, we will be back in order to use our other Yelp deal and because the owner, Chris is a really nice guy.  I guess we have to make sure that Silkie isn't working that night so we don't feel the hostility from the moment we sit down.  But if she is working, make sure you show her your Yelp deal ahead of time, otherwise you'll have an angry server to deal with.", "author": "E M."}

Nestled in the heart of the Marina, and surrounded by all of the pricier, hipster restaurants and bars, sits Nectar Wine Lounge.  Granted, I can't honestly tell you what kind of crowd you'll find yourself in here, since we came on a Sunday, and we were the only ones in there...but it was 25% off wines and the happy hour menu, and we got extra attention and awesome service, so I'm not complaining.\n\nThe Riesling flight had nice variety, the ceviche was small but delicious, and the truffle popcorn was pleasantly different.  I wished they served truffle popcorn in the theaters instead of that god-awful overpriced, artery-clogging salt and butter concoction.\n\nI'm a little biased on the desserts since I detest strawberries (on the vanilla bean cheesecake) and not a huge chocolate fan (the caramel/chocolate thing-don't know what it's called).

The staff hadn't figured out a sensible way to distribute the food in the narrow, packed room. (let alone napkins)\n\nI thought about cutting them some slack because it was a special event, but if a venue agrees to host a party they should know how to do it. Sure, it was a room full of scrappy actors and other industry people trying to eke out a living in this godforsaken backwater of a town, but then you've also got people like me who hire caterers, rent venues and throw parties...so it's worth always putting your best foot forward if you can.\n\nBack to the wine...excellent selection served up by knowledgeable, patient folks.

First of all, to rent out the entire place, there was only a food and drink minimum, and a $100 deposit, both of which I felt were more than reasonable.  Leah was really responsive, had great ideas and was extremely nice.  The food was amazing.  In particular I don't think I've ever heard more raving about the bacon wrapped dates.  The tuna tartare was super as well.  They both passed plates and had stuff set out.  Music was set to my brother's favorite music, and the place was lit with candles, and looked great.  We had 50 people there, but you easily could have fit more or less and it would have been equally nice, the way the room is organized.  We had beer options, but most people drank wine, of which we had a sparkling, white, rose, and 2 red options!  The bartenders seemed to remember everything everyone was drinking!  Very impressive!  The overall bill was totally reasonable and under what we had budgeted for.  Finally, she let us bring in cupcakes at no extra charge!

The menu is not extensive and limited, but there is enough to keep most people interested. We shared a few things and took bites off each other's plates. We started off with a crab and artichoke gratin thing that I loved. The gratin was a little flaky but not too heavy (just like me). \n\nThen came out a ahi tartare and a mac n cheese. The food paring probably not what most of you foodies would consider ideal, but I was really wanting to try the mac. I like it, but did not love it. maybe I'm used to the Bell Towers truffle mac which is one of my all times favorites.

Example: 2006 La Petite Ferme, Cabernet Sauvignon- an offering of dark chocolate studded with black currants & tobacco by an aromatic suede jacket clad erudite gentleman with salt & pepper temples, a silver tongue and slim buttocks.  \n\n6 glasses of wine and $36 saved from the HH special later, my friend and I finally decided we should leave.

Both waiters/bartenders seemed a lot more interested in taking care of people at the bar, rather than the 6 or 8 tables in the back.  The wine was fine, can't complain about that... but the service, all around, was just terrible.

Couple of great pro's\n\n1) Good wine list! I noticed there was a retail price next to each wine and puzzled I asked about it. Who writes the retail price next to the restaurant bottled price so people know how much more they're paying to drink in house??!?...The bartender informed me that they actually sell wines there as well so if you taste a wine you enjoy, they'll sell it to you for the much lower retail price...never experienced that before...can you say AWESOME?!? (also love how they present the bottle in front of you and leave it there while you wine taste so you can inspect and read the labeling to become more familiar with the particular wine)\n\n2) Service-speedy, personal, and fun. Our bartender Alex was awesome, incredibly knowledgeable and helpful with the wine list. It was our first time there but we felt like regulars. He was funny, engaging, and personable. Later when these guys tried to talk to me and my gf...he and the other staff made sure we were okay. Everyone there was great, protective yet not intrusive, and made the experience a really enjoyable one. \n\n3) Food-we just tried the ahi tartare and salmon flatbread. Salmon flatbread was a tasty light treat that complements the wine pretty well. Can't say I'm a fan of the ahi tartare. I personally love ahi tartare but it didn't taste very fresh, too chewy, and not very flavorful. I heard the mac'n'cheese is great but we were going light that night.\n\n4) Ambiance-great. Good music, good bar seating, plenty of cozy tables and couches for more privacy. Good place to sip wine at a bar, go on a date, or bring a group of friends to socialize.\n\nOverall-loved it.

Our two favorites were from Copain and Elizabeth Spencer, but I honestly liked all of the wines that we tasted.\n\nAside from the Hidden Vine, I don't know when I've had such attentive service.  Our server paced the tasting very well, and gave detailed descriptions of each sampling, in a very friendly and personable way.  The manager also came over a lot, and was genuinely interested in what we thought.  It was almost as though we were guest of a good friend who collects wine and was excited to share his latest finds.  \n\nI ordered the seared ahi, and it was a perfect for a light dinner.  The ahi was tender and peppery, and it came with a green bean & potato salad that was fresh and crunchy.

Well, it's sort of like having several pairs of black shoes.  Lace-up patent leather stiletto boots and demure Mary-Jane pumps usually work best with different outfits or moods.  I find the same is true with wine bars.  I have one for when I want quiet enjoyment with friends, one for that romantic evening when I don't want to pick my own wines and one for when I feel festive and fun.  Nectar is my festive and fun choice.\n \nI've come to Nectar on several occasions, often for the special wine flight tasting nights, and have been extremely impressed.  The tasting flight evenings are often paired with visits from the actual winemakers, which is a big treat.  The wine list lends itself to build-your-own flights since the number of wines available by taste or glass is extensive --- and I would come just to read the wine descriptions alone, they are so ornate, funny and over the top!\n\nOh, and those 'tasting' pours...um, these are not your 1 ounce pours folks, but a serious mouthful that lets you really experience the wine!\n\nThe staff really knows their stuff, too, and all are willing to give you the time to describe and/or recommend, even when it's busy.

When you think of a lounge in the Marina, you think of the center of hell.  I get it.  \r\n\r\nWith that said, however, Nectar has continued to surprise me with its un-center-of-hellishness.  Unlike its competitor around the corner (Wine Merchant), it is spacious with comfortable places to sit.  Even when Chestnut, and every bar in the surrounding area, is packed, this place is tucked away on Steiner St. with plenty of seating.  And speaking of seating, the place is scattered with big over-stuffed arm chairs that you can sink into while sipping red out of a big beautiful glass.  \r\n\r\nThe biggest surprise offered by Nectar, though, was the food.  I went last night with my husband for an after-work glass of wine or three, and ordered for the first time off of their dinner menu.  I had the pork tenderloin, which was CRAZY good.  For a place whose focal point is wine, the quality of the food threw me for a loop.  Very small portions - but that's the intention.  Just meant to give you something small to enjoy that brings out the flavors in your wine.  Pork tenderloin with a potato terrine, wilted spinach and cranberry was only $10.50.  It was the perfect compliment to my wine.  Afterwards, we had a cheese plate.  My only complaint is that they have pretty boring cheeses on their cheese plate.  All very mild cow's and goat's milk cheeses.  No blues at all.  \r\n\r\nAn all-around cozy place to unwind.  Lots of pros, but two cons:  1.  It's in the Marina, and 2.  The cheese thing...cause I like blue cheese.  \r\n\r\nThey have a Morgan \"Twelve Clones\" Pinot Noir right now that is really great, by the way.  Go.

Normally I am not a Marina crowd kind of girl, but Nectar was a pleasant surprise.  Attracting a slightly older crowd than the typical early-20s bunch in the Marina really helps.  \n\nBesides two specific wines we wanted to try, we put 4 additional tastes into the hands of the bartender (and maybe partial owner?).  He gave us some wonderful tastes, we weren't sure we liked the Malbec, so he replaced it with an Italian wine.  Absolutely delicious and only $20 a bottle retail, so I bought one.  Although I have to say, I'm not sure I came home with the right bottle because I distinctly remember the wine being a long Italian name starting with an 'N', but that's not what I have at home now.  I'm sure this bottle will be great as well.\n\nThe gnocchi and beet salad were pretty good.  Salad was a bit over-dressed, but tasty nonetheless.  Also, I HIGHLY recommend the butterscotch pot de creme with the Hungarian dessert wine they had.  Coming from someone that just really doesn't like dessert, this is really a big compliment.  \n\nI wish Nectar were closer to where I lived, as I would definitely frequent it, but being so far out in the Marina is a bit of a deterrent.

Not only does it have a hip ambiance with classy decor, and music that is audible but not too loud, but it also has fantastic seating! ah yes, this does indeed matter. \n\nHow often are we all cramped together, nearly sitting on one-another, looking for a reasonable place to place our clutch or hang our ginormous handbag, not to mention drape our jacket? Much less sit comfortably with our companion... Well, at Nectar, have no fear! No one gets the better seat (i.e. bench vs. chair), as the both of you get your very own huge, comfortable couch/chair! Nectar is one of the few places where I have thoroughly enjoyed my seating arrangement! (yes, I'm a nerd for actually having an opinion on seating arrangements...) :)\n\nOK, back to the basics. The wine was fantastic! My friend and I ended up starting with a white flight  to cool-off (since this was the Friday it was SOO hott in SF recently). Since Nectar changes their flights frequently, it's hard to recall the name of it, but it was something like \"anything but chard\" (though now, 5 days later, they ironically have an \"everything chard\" flight) cute. :) So ours had a green wine from Portugal (I believe), something with the taste of pineapple muddled in it, a fabulous wine reminiscent of a viognier, and a couple others. \n\nOur second flight was all malbecs. To our surprise, we discovered we actually favored a non-Argentinian malbec! Of course now I don't recall it's origin, but how often do you find non-Argentinian malbecs anyway? Very peculiar, and a most delightful flight!\n\nMost importantly - I love that Nectar actually pours you sufficient liquid to do a proper tasting with your flight. Unlike many places, Nectar's flights are substantial and very reasonably dispensed. Instead of giving you a meer few sips per wine, they actually give you nearly a glass per. We were both very appreciative that they actually wanted us to sample and enjoy the wines. \n\nTo accompany our malbecs, we ordered some beef carpaccio - delicious! And we sampled some crazy-yummy cheeses! \n\nEver the romantic ambiance, but also perfect for a girls' night out!

You are probably paying the fact that you're having wine in a fancy location, in a fancy neighbourhood (compare the price of a bottle drank over there or brought home). They had a St. Emilion 2001 for around 40 dollars. Ok, let's have it! Well, they were out of it at the very end and the guy came to us saying: \" We can give you a 2003 for the same price\". It's ok, it's ok....but you know that 2001 was a special year for France in that region, right? Silence. I love to talk about wine even before drinking it so that silence disappointed me a little bit. Cheers.\n\nUPDATE: No seriously, you cannot pay almost 20 bucks for two tastings. My Willamette Pinot Noir (Panther something) was utterly flat, roaming with sulfites while my girlfriend's glass was nothing more than a punch of acidity and a burst of alcohol.

There weren't many people at the restaurant because it was a Monday night, so we thought it would be relatively quick.  \n\nOverall, I was surprised by the poor service.  When we sat (ourselves) down, we had to wait a bit for menus.  And when we ordered, many of the items on the menu were not being served that day or they were out of it...and the server didn't tell us until we attempted to order them.  We ordered goat cheese crepes with figs and a chocolate mousse thing.  The cholocate mousse came out very quickly, but it took longer for the crepes.  10 minutes later, we asked about them.  The server, in one of the most condescending tones I've ever heard, said, \"I know you still haven't gotten your crepes.  They are made a la carte, so they take time.\"  I don't think she realized that a la carte means on the side.  Whatever.  After another 10 minutes, no crepes.  We ask again, she said (again, rather condescendingly), \"I already told you they take a long time.  I'll check again but I know the chef is making them.\"  After another 5 minutes, we ask again, indicating that if they don't come out soon, we don't really want them anymore.  She finally goes to check on them and tells us they would be ready in two minutes (which they were).\n\nSince I've only been there once, I would attribute this bad experience to that particular server because everything (and everybody) else seemed great.  The manager or owner (whoever he was) came over to our table afterwards to apologize for the long wait and explained that the long wait was caused by the fact that the crepe batter is made when the crepes are ordered (our server's speak for \"a la carte\").  An explanation for why it was taking so long was helpful for us to understand what caused the long wait rather than just putting us off or making excuses.  He also didn't charge us for the dessert.\n\nIf the owner/manager hadn't approached our table at the end of the meal, I definitely would have given Nectar a lower star rating.

I don't enjoy it much and I enjoy the culture even less sometimes. It's not for me. Still, I know that I can have fun at a wine bar. There are wine bars that work for me, and are comfortable, hip places. Hotel Biron I suppose is one. Jungle Vino in Reno is another.\n\nNectar is a most-despicable wine bar. It represents many of the things and people I despise in the Marina. Still, it could have been saved with the slightest ounce of creativity...and it wasn't. \n\nOne thing Nectar has going for it is their actual wine. They have a serious selection, and my wino friend and his sommelier roomate both confirmed this. In fact the sommelier roomate went there to blind taste and study for her level 2 sommelier exam. That says something to me and that's why Nectar gets 2 stars instead of one.\n\nHowever, everything else was bizarre or out-of-place. The crowd was old for the Marina (30-50's). But the music was too young (early 20's, Kanye West?). The sommeliers knew their stuff cold, but had no passion/presence. They looked like disgruntled waiters. Lastly, the space, which is narrow and awkwardly set up, was totally unoriginal. The ambient light was very high. The art on the walls was actually nice, but again didn't fit the space. The whole design felt lazy. I'm not a fan. At least the Nectar in Burlingame looks the part.", "author": "Tolga E."}

It's a nice spot and the bartenders are very friendly and very helpful (although not always present and sometimes hard to flag down). I ordered a champagne flight and the 2nd champagne of the flight was out of stock. That being said, they opened up a nicer bottle of champagne and served it, and it was definitely the best champagne of the group. Then, we ordered a port wine and after opening the bottle, the server immediately knew it went bad. He poured it into a glass, sniffed it, and pushed it to the side and then let us smell it to get a sense of what a bad wine smelled like. He then opened another bottle and served that one. We then ordered the chocolate souffle. Warning... it's extremely SMALL!! Like.. half the size I expected it to be. Well.. it came out but they were missing ice cream so they offered to bake us another souffle free of charge. But of course, after 10 minutes, they came out to tell us they had run out of souffle and instead, would be giving us a butterscotch mousse. OMG.. I am SO GLAD that they were out of souffles! This dessert was DELICIOUS!! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. It has yummy cookie crumbles on it that just make it delicious. Normally, I find butterscotch to be too sweet and overpowering but this one was just right.... creamy with good flavor but with moderated sweetness. And then the wines that were recommended with our desserts went just perfectly!! I was absolutely stunned. \n\nThe only downside of this place in my mind is price. It's ridiculously expensive! I mean.. I got the bill and just sat and looked at it for a while. Apparently, a glass of the port wine I drank cost $14 and the pours weren't even that large! The trick is that they have a couple prices listed: pour, glass, bottle. Beware of not just looking at the number on the left; it's the itsy bitsy pour price and it will trick you as it did me!", "author": "Lauren C."}

I like the comfy upholstered chairs, but everything else about the place just didn't do it for me. The white walls could use a nice rich color to warm up the atmosphere of the place. \n\nThere is a good selection of wines, but the menu is extremely limited. We had the prawns wrapped in prosciutto and those were very good. The suggested white wine pairing was very good as well. But the \"jambon et gruyere\" sandwich was a very sad, sad grilled ham and cheese -- not good at all...and I am not someone who easily turns away from a grilled cheese sandwich! The red wine pairing with that was so-so, but not fabulous.\n\nOverall, I just don't see what the fuss is about this place. There are better wine lounges in the city. We ended up going next door to Isa for a bunch of small plates and a couple half bottles of red. Fabulous restaurant! \n\nWe really loved Isa. Nectar on the other hand is just average and the place has no ambience.", "author": "Christine P."}

I caught Mr. Jim Look-Alike reading a book which I initially thought was rude but he was just reading on a wine that they had. Apparently, the staff get tested by the owner daily basis and they go to wine tasting a lot. Also my husband who's not big on wine, forgot what kind he had and one of the servers were able to tell him by looking at his glass (is this possible or was I already drunk and easily impressed).\n\nThe decor was nice.

It no longer is presented in a round shaped with the thinly sliced cucumber. But they do have Mac and Cheese which is absolutely delicious!\nDefinitely one of my all time favorite places!", "author": "Myra M."}

We had 2 glasses of wine each at half price and they were all wonderful. We sat in the chairs against the wall and they were cozy and comfortable. I've been to quite a few wine bars around the city and so far I like the selection here the best. While others might make fun of the descriptions of the wine, I found them really fantastic...very creative and on top of it they seemed to be correct....Nice music was playing and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly.

They even doled out a couple of free glasses after I saved the place from burning down!!!  Hey guys, be careful with the paper menu-votive candle combo; I may not be there to bound to the rescue next time.  I'm a wine superhero!  Let's pick out a name for me!  Dionysus' Avenger?

Generally, we found the wines to be aromatically complex and very exciting on the nose, but a few were too light on the palate.\n\nThe foie gras terrine was nicely plated with a tasty huckleberry compote, but actually it was the phyllo-wrapped mushroom duxelle which blew me away.

Less \"manly\" than described (\"a muscular, dusty & austere spanish lad whose bitter almond breath recalls the fate of unrequited love\"...maybe the sweeter implications of unrequited love escaped me when reading the menu)\n\n2006 Chateau de Campuget, Viognier 'Cuve Prestige', Rhone, France\nThis one's a star!

(There were two champagnes and a Prosecco, and all were delicious.)\nHaving had a mishap with a muddy box of kale earlier in the day, I wasn't looking my best, and was somewhat reluctant to go, but seeing as my co-worker was looking very good, I figured I would go and just kind of hide behind her. At 5:00 pm when we arrived, it was very quiet, with just one other group of people there. Soon afterward, many, many gals came flocking to Nectar... the ratio of women to men was similar to that of a nail salon... or a convent. My friend and I were the only people of color in the place, except for our server, who was also a person of color, and who seemed to hate our guts. She gave good information about the wines when we asked questions, but she did so in an utterly bored, rote recitation sort of way. \n\nAt Nectar, it's fun to read the extremely poetic and fanciful descriptions of the wines in the wine book (something about toasted almonds kissing a tear stained cheek in autumn and a caress of spearmint... no kidding), the selection is vast, and the bar, excuse me, lounge, is pretty inside. It's apparently a place where you can bring a baby, get drunk, and no one looks askance: a Marina MILF- type teetered over to us on her narrow heels, smiling expansively, and told me her son had a huge crush on me and couldn't take his eyes off me. The son in question was an infant so young I don't think his eyes were even focused.\n\n*edit* \n\nOn my second visit to Nectar, I tried two appetizers-- one was a phyllo dough-wrapped mushroom puff with two dabs of aoli... yummy but teeny-tiny. I guess that's to be expected. The other was their black truffle popcorn. It's super salty and oily and you can taste the delicate black truffle flavor. A big yum when you're getting slightly drunk! \n\n(Appetizer prices will run up quickly, so if you're hungry and budget-conscious, just get the black truffle popcorn to nibble while you have a drink and then stagger right next door to Barney's for a burger and fries.)\n\n The service was nice this time around so I changed my stars from 3 to 4.", "author": "Dani Y."}

Wine bars are generally waaaaay too concerned with their stuffed shirt, holier than thou images to surrender to the kind of sharp humor that Nectar write into their menus.

They didn't have a menu for appetizers and the waitress was rude when we asked for a menu. She yelled that they don't have a menu because their food changes everyday. What place serves food but doesn't have a printed menu? When we wanted our bill it took forever. Then she took her grand time to pick it back up. The atmosphere isn't very well thought out. I thought the lighting, painting, and furniture didn't mesh well. The wine I ordered was really good. Probably one of the best glasses I've had in a while.

They are friendly and not the least bit snooty.  Kudos to the Nectar sommeliers and bartenders.  Never been poured something I did not like.  And never ended up with a bill that was ridiculous.  \n\nOn top of which, during happy hour, every glass is HALF off.

I love the decor, I love the menu, and I love the wine. I have been back a couple times since, and it has been great. Once I went with an out-of-town guest on a random weekday, and we were the only ones in the lounge, which was fine by me. I love their wine flights because they let you taste different wines that you definitely wouldn't be able to otherwise. Another cool feature is they allow you to buy \"to-go\" bottles of wine for market cost, so if you taste something you like, you don't have to pay double for it to buy it from Nectar. Plus, if you're hungry, they have a great food menu to snack on. Sadly, this place is a little out of my poor-grad-student budget, so I can't go to it as often as I'd like. It is in the Marina, so I wouldn't expect it to be cheap, but still... it can't be 5 stars for me unless it's amazing AND worth every penny.

Yes, I hit a wine lounge after tasting wine all day.  That sadly meant, I was not incredibly tempted by the wine list, however, I felt compelled to review the spot in any case as I felt the wine list was fantastic with generous taste portions, ability to make your own flight, and oh, people who really know the wine they are serving.  Kind of key for a wine lounge!  I love the notion of a tapas dinner, and by the same token, there are times I like the same notion for my wines, so I can't wait to come back and really give that a go here. The wine descriptions are fun to read - very creative.  The staff is great.  There was a very charming guy behind the bar who had to contend with one of the other ZAPers who had not ensured through the day as well as my friend and I had.  The 'bartender' for lack of a better word (but there must be one, right?  it is too early and I am uncaffeinated, so I can't pull that term up right now!) was so gracious with this very intoxicated guy who really was just looking for a spot to eat his deli sandwich he brought in while he tried to order some wine.  The bartender tried to help him figure out what he really wanted without any success.  Throughout the whole time (and mind you, my friend and I were both a bit concerned this guy who drunkenly had sat at the bar next to our table and could have easily fallen off the comfy, backless bar \"cube\" chairs -- and likely would have 86'ed this guys if it were up to us) the bartender was very kind and never escalated the situation.

Every Tuesday from 6-9 a different winery hosts a tasting for about $20/person. If you have been to Nectar before, you would agree that they give generous tasting portions there, and $20 for about 2 glasses (4 tastings) of wine is a pretty good deal! Not only do they have this great special on Tuesdays, but I have tried several of their other dishes which have been pretty good...the short rib, gnocchi, and the souffl\u00e9s are some of my favorites. The gem of this place is Alex, he serves the wine at the bar and he is very knowledgeable and personable. I am still very new to drinking wine and whenever my boyfriend and I ask him questions he always has great answers and teaches us so much about the wine.

I do think it's a great wine, but once again, at Nectar's prices they need to do something to separate themselves from the pack. Still, we both enjoyed a really fantastic bottle of Grant Burge, an Australian Rhone blend and both thought that the food was certainly terrific. The Arctic Char was killer, the cheeks were perfectly done and the Tortellini was also fantastic. The space is bit weird, kinda feels like your in an abandoned museum, and there is no real bar scene here by any means, so more of a date spot. So, Nectar was OK, and in San Francisco, I'm not sure  just OK is enough to make me go back, because honestly I prefer District's imaginative wine selections, chic food and ambiance, or the bustling noise, rare California Pinot's by the glass and late night bar scene of the California Wine Merchant", "author": "Steve l."}

In fact, she was so terrible that I was tempted to ask for the manager just to explain that we were so disappointed. it was like she was actively trying to be mean to us! She almost wouldn't seat us in the back, even though it was empty. Her question was, \"well, are you sure that there are people coming? because i don't want to put you at a big table if they're not going to show. *sneer*\" (our friends were politely waiting outside so as not to crowd the patrons sitting in the front of the restaurant). My mom was in from out of town, and we had guests visiting from abroad, and it was so embarrassing that she was so unwelcoming in a place that I had talked up. Nectar is supposed to be a classy place. Bad service, slow service, little errors, forgotten orders... that I can handle. It's a restaurant, people are busy and things are bound to get mixed up.

In fact, she was downright mean to the guests, got angry with me about \"minimums\" I'd never been told about in front of the guest of honor without pulling me aside to discuss (even though we had enough to eat/drink to surpass her \"minimums\" of $40/$50 dollars per person), we waited at least 20 minutes for every request - from more wine to simply asking for a menu, she overpoured the champagne I had pre-ordered (up to the rim!) and she never once smiled or asked us if we needed anything. Basically, Shree ruined the vibe of the party. We finally packed up and left to go somewhere else because we were tired of Shree's unacceptable attitude and waiting for our requests to be met. When I called Chris to discuss her absolute disregard for our table, he told me that he had a hard time believing me, and said only that the issue would be 'addressed'. Our party spent almost $500 dollars - with a 20% tip that was automatically added for the size of our party (8 people) and it honestly made me SICK to give that 20% to someone whose service was beyond sub-par. Thank god I was with friends and not clients - if I had been entertaining for business I would have been appalled. Nectar has not only lost my business, but the business of every person at that party. Again - what a disappointment!!", "author": "Sarah B."}
