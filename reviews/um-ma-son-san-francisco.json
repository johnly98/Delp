It's a one-woman show and she locks the door when she can't handle any more customers. If you run into this situation, you can wait outside and she'll start letting people in again when she's ready. I gotta respect that attitude. \n\nWe ordered a seafood bibimbap $16.95, a beef bibimbap $14.95, and a seafood tofu soup $11.95. The bibimbaps were delicious, but I probably wouldn't order the tofu soup again. You couldn't see any pieces of seafood in it, and there wasn't very much quantity. Maybe I'd get a kimchi stew instead?\n\nA bottle of beer is $6 and is enormous about equal to two normal bottles of beer. This is the best value on the menu. \n\nGoing with the theme, this is a homestyle place, so you get some typical homestyle banchan. If you want excitement and ambiance, go somewhere else. If you want comfort Korean, come to Um Ma Son.", "author": "Julia C."}

Seriously, this umma is amazing.\n\nCame for a late night dinner after a concert in the city, and sis and I wanted some hearty Asian food since it was rainy and around 10PM in the evening. Thank goodness for yelp's guidance to Um Ma Son in Richmond. We were the only other group that went in to eat--a table of four was finishing up when we went in. We were immediately served hot barley tea and given banchan once we placed our orders--seafood pancake to share, beef glass noodles for sis, and seafood tofu soup for me. \n\nEverything came out super fast considering that this smiley Korean g-ma was the only one working all of the positions! Food was so delicious, and all of the banchan were yummy. We asked her for more of a select banchan, and she smiled and said something in Korean and brought it out. The food was not oily, like most seafood pancakes are, and the flavors were SO prominent. Diners who care a lot about ambiance and the \"lewk\" of a place might be turned off by how basic and lacking Um Ma Son is. But if you grew up eating in low-key places like this, you'd agree with me that aesthetic means nothing in a Korean spot. This place accepts card, and there are restrooms in the back.\n\nThe warm and no frills space, comforting quality food, and basic aesthetic reminded me of how great simplicity and good food should be more than enough to keep customers like me happy. It's quiet and music-less, so it's great for a quiet dinner or smaller groups. I will definitely come back to Um Ma Son for delicious and worthy Korean tofu soup and dishes like seafood pancake!", "author": "Jodi H."}

It was surprisingly open late and had prices equivalent to korean mom and pop shop's in Santa Clara. I always expect prices of things in SF to be super inflated lol. Most of us ordered the beef tofu soup in spicy, which she cranked out really fast. The food actually came before our side dishes. Which by the way were really yummy, I've never had fishcake that good before and the potato was really flavorful too. I found the soup to be a little watery and not as filling as other places. It was also a little hard to flag her down for side and water refills but it was understandable because another party of 5 came in. Another con was that she didn't give us change... but we meant to tip her $15 anyway so I guess it doesn't matter. \n\nDecor here is really cute!

Luckily this places pretty much stays open as long as there's paying customers.  The owner is this little Korean lady that cooks, takes your order, serves and clears your tables.  She has 1 other helper and that's it!  It is a small place, but large enough to host a couple of large groups.

To the point where we had to shout to talk. \n\nIt's a great place to go with friends looking for some cheap eats.  There can be a little bit of a language barrier with the little lady, so best not stray from the menu too much when ordering.   We ordered some Bulgogi, Bibimbap  and tofu soups.  We did have one person on our table that asked for a Kimchi soup to not be spicy, and also we had someone with a sesame seed allergy so we asked for no sesame seeds.   Our meals came our with sesame seeds and the soups were at the normal spicy level.   There wasn't too much sesame seeds, so we were able to pick around it.   But we did send back one of the soups and instead of having a new one with less spice, it came back with extra spice.     After another 2-3 tries on explaining what we wanted, we were able to get a non-spicy soup. \n\nHowever the food was really great.

Initially glad we found a Korean restaurant with such good reviews open late  at night, but left pretty underwhelmed.\nWe kind of under-ordered (shared seafood pancake and ddukbokgi, and soft tofu for 4) and I think this kind of left a meh impression with the lady who seemed to be working by herself..\n\nSide dishes pretty mediocre in terms of variety.\nDdukbokgi, which only had glass noodles and rice cakes, was pretty tasteless.\nAlso, we thought we ordered a medium seafood pancake but got charged for a large...  But we felt bad for under ordering (and intimidated) so we didn't say anything..\n\nIf I had to come back, I'd get the soft tofu!", "author": "Heyun J."}

We stood in the storefront display (this awkward front window space that could fit another table perfectly but was oddly empty like it was some sacred burial site) like starved fat kids for about 15 minutes before the waitress even acknowledged us to tell us there would be a 45 minute wait. We waited. \n\nThere was one 2 person table that opened up and a couple who came in immediately sat down at that table. They were brought water. They waited. And waited. And waited. They left (they didn't even order). They then crammed all 3 of us at this 2 person table (didn't even have an extra chair so we squeezed 2 on a bench).  We immediately placed our order. One of the bigger tables opened up and one waitress motioned that we would be able to switch over but a VERY RUDE lady came in talking loudly on her phone and approached and touched the waitress from behind while she was busing the table. She sat down at that table and loudly told her friends on the line that they had seating. (OUR TABLE.) \n\nShortly after, OUR seafood pancake came out and was delivered to the table we were suppose to switch to. Obliviously, the rude lady started devouring it before her friends even arrived. For some reason unknown, she didn't even indicate or maybe even realize it was someone else's order. Her and her friends ordered in bouts of half chewed seafood pancake oozing from their mouths. We all stared in shock as our loving seafood pancake was ravenously consumed by 4 loud ladies who also stole our table. \n\nNext we waited. And waited. And waited. Our two beef tofu soups and hot stone bibimbap seemed to be served to other tables. Tables who sat down after us including the ladies who stole our table were served. I politely reminded the waitress we were STILL waiting and to please check up on our order since NOTHING has arrived yet. She was swamped and did not seem to check up on it. We waited. And waited. And waited. In the span of us waiting, we observed a pretty inconspicable yet convincing drug drop/pick up and 2 lonely strangers finding each other and becoming best friends. \n\nI hailed the waitress down again and she apologized profusely and offered us a beer to make up for it. We waited and chatted to the table next to us who saw the injustice of the table stealing, seafood devouring gluttons with no course of action to fix the wrongs. They were given their check BEFORE one of their orders even came. They told the waitress they never got one of their orders (another strike from the gluttonous pacman ladies?!). Upon learning it wasn't even in the works of being made, they just paid for what they ate and left. \n\nFinally our food came out. A thick, doughy seafood pancake, two very bland tofu soups with FIRM (not silken) tofu and a decent hot stone bibimbap but by no means is worth a trip over to this place.", "author": "Michelle W."}

The kimchi pancakes were good but they got mushy as we got to the center. The bulgogi was flavorful but a little tough, and the kimchi fried rice was a little too greasy and mushy for my taste.

Bf was set on having Korean food.  First, we went to Toyose but it was already crowded and a 45 min wait didn't sound too appealing to us.  Determined to have his Korean din, bf and I headed to Um Ma Son after doing a quick search on yelp. \n\nWhen we arrived at UMS, the place was pretty empty around 8pm.  Only two tables occupied the small eatery.  We were a little weary but nonetheless happy about not having to wait.  There were three ladies running the place - owner, chef and waitress.  The waitress was welcoming.\n\nWe ordered a small Seafood Pancake, Kimchi Pork, Tofu and Vermicelli Stir-fry and rice.  The banchan came out promptly after we ordered.  Pretty standard but my fav was the pickled cucumbers, which were a refreshing contrast to the spicy kimchi.  I even asked for more cucumbers and the owner gladly gave us generous seconds.  The seafood pancake was a bit too greasy and could use more seafood.  For a small size, it was actually pretty big and we took some home.  The stir-fry was lacking meat which was a bit of a bummer.  There was plenty of tofu and kimchi but we only found roughly 6 tiny slices of meat in the entire dish.\n\nThe prices were reasonable and food was decent.  It definitely has a mom and pop shop.

Those who have mentioned that they've heard the owner yelling at servers in the kitchen, cussing under her breath at customers, charging some arbitrary number (because she WILL ADD TO YOUR TOTAL if she feels you didn't order enough)...you're not crazy!  It's true. This woman is the worst.\n\nAnd.  She may seem really sweet but according to my friend, she has and WILL compliment you/butter you up, and then say the utmost terrible stuff behind your back in Korean, assuming you won't understand.  She's called people ugly, sluts, bitches, etc.  And not in a way that is typical within the service/food industry.  I'm a waitress, I get frustrated.  I get it.  But no.  This woman will go out of her way to compliment you and then maliciously comment on how you look, act, eat, breathe, simply exist, whatever.  It gets racist, too.  \n\nMy friend wants to move on and put her time at Um Ma Son behind her but I'm gonna continue to be angry for her.  I've read reviews that mention the terrible ways a business will treat its employees and customers and, lol, have eaten there anyway.  Because, like, what's the point, really.  My one shitty review isn't gonna stop this woman from being a shitty person.  So, please.  As you were.  Just know this woman sucks.\n\nOther than that...food is pretty good.", "author": "Ano N."}

Hot pot and K-BBQ are two completely different things. We originally went to Shabu House on Ocean but it was closed (I guess due to Easter Sunday). My bf really wanted hot pot, so we found one in Richmond (Grassland Hot Pot). Got there and it was closed too...we assumed it was because of Easter Sunday again but then we saw a sign that it was suspended because of something with alcohol. You can guess our facial expressions: -____-\nHaha. So we searched on Yelp for anything close by to eat, since most places seemed to be closed around 10 pm. Um Ma Son was open! So we headed there...\n\nEntering Um Ma Son, only one man sat at the table. My party of 3 was seated at the table in the back by the register. Eventually about 2 more parties came in later that night. \n\nThe place is kinda small but a good size. The ladies working here that night were sweet, but understaffed. They only had one person waiting the tables/register, and one working in the kitchen. Parking was a bit easier than usual because it was late-night and Easter Sunday. The price is a few bucks cheaper than other Korean restaurants in the city. \n\nI think the overall food quality was mediocre. My friend and I ordered the seafood pancake, spicy pork, and kalbi to share. On a side note, our banchans arrived after 2 plates was already served.. \n\nSeafood pancake: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/um-ma-son-san-francisco?select=L33xHohIeq7-kEzD38vjew#biSUwtWcCrQ0T4D4cCMruQ\nOrdered seafood pancake cause it was in the highlights, but then again, what Korean restaurant isn't popular for their seafood pancake?! Haha. I like this one cause it was meatier than other restaurants. (More shrimps! I think..) They also come with a sauce but I forgot to try it :(\n\nKalbi: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/um-ma-son-san-francisco?select=L33xHohIeq7-kEzD38vjew#sRRS4MsO7Uta0PwAufxlKg\nWhen Kalbi and spicy pork first came out, it was  sizzling! It was like zzzzz... *makes the sizzle noise* :) \nThe Kalbi was alright. The flavor didn't stand out too much but it was a good amount to bring out the taste still. \n\nSpicy Pork: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/um-ma-son-san-francisco?select=L33xHohIeq7-kEzD38vjew#XLoTN4UInuEVzzdXzvw-LA\nThis plate was a bit of a disappoint. It was good, but it wasn't spicy...and I like my food spicy. I think the spice to it was more mild than spicy. Probably a 6/10 in 'hotness' ranking, haha. (See what I did there? Haha!) \n\nRice: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/um-ma-son-san-francisco?select=L33xHohIeq7-kEzD38vjew#eFsSXBE_HE5XA5z6EAXu3A\nYeah...who writes a review on rice? Lol.

The restaurant is fairly clean, not too big (7 tables of 4) and has a bathroom. They serve traditional side dishes like bean sprouts, kimchi, tofu, and marinated potatoes. We were served 5 minutes after we ordered our dishes. \n\nFor my main dish, I got noodles with kimchi, tofu, bean sprouts and beef. It was a big dish for $13. If you don't like spicy food, don't order this because it is pretty spicy. The dish was okay but only had very few pieces of beef. You can definitely eat the dish for two meals with rice, even though there is noodle inside. \n\nOverall, nothing too special about the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-27", "description": "tl;dr\n\nBest tofu chigae in the city. Open till 2 AM most days!!\n\n---\n\nUm Ma Son is one of those places that you don't want too many people to know about, because once too many people catch on to the secret, then the place will go downhill. It's like discovering a local cafe that has ample seating and plenty of outlets, but is somehow strangely quiet on a Saturday afternoon - you definitely want to keep that on the DL!! ;)\n\nWe've been here no less than six or seven times, with our first visit here to try the Kalbi-Chim (stewed kalbi in sweet sauce with potatoes and carrots) on a recommendation from a friend. He said that Um Ma Son had the best rendition of it that he has ever tasted in the US, and highly recommended us to go - I made it a mental note to try Um Ma Son the next time when I was in SF.\n\nHonestly, I don't remember that much about the Kalbi-Chim that day over a year ago, but our Korean dining scene in SF has never been the same since.\n\nLike other Yelpers mentioned, UMS is literally a one (wo)man show, with a nice Korean lady that handles all the cooking, serving, and cleaning after hours (around 10:30 or so). We've learned that apparently when you go earlier she has a helper or two, but they actually get off work at around 10 or so since we've seen them leave. \n\nThe menu is generally Korean home-style dishes. They have some KBBQ too, but with Han Il Kwan so close and the prices for meat quite expensive at UMS, we have never gotten it.\n\nWe've had a great sampling of their other dishes, and out of what we've had, we highly recommend the TOFU CHIGAE.\n\nUMS honestly makes the best tofu chigae in the city (yes, I've been to My Tofu House - which is a close runner-up). The soup for some reason is extremely savory, but very rarely salty or too spicy (which appears to often be cop-out methods at restaurants to make their tofu chigaes more palatable). The savoriness of the broth has made UMS a go-to place for us on cold evenings when a warm bowl of broth seems extremely appealing. :)\n\nOther than that, I really enjoy their KIMCHI BO KUM (stir-fried tofu, pork, kimchi, and jap chae noodles). It goes really well with rice and I think they make one of the best renditions of this dish. \n\nWe've had their bibimbap, seafood pancake, and the kalbitang, and although they all received passing marks, none were solidly in the \"outstanding\" category. The kalbi-chim was actually pretty decent, but after we had the corresponding dish (and kalbitang) at Han Il Kwan, we suspect that HIK probably just generally makes better kalbi dishes than UMS.\n\nHer banchan is usually so-so, with a few tasty ones (I like the spicy radish when she has it and the fish cake), they come in really small dishes but she will be very happy to refill it for you :) She actually packs banchan in to-go orders, which I thought was really thoughtful :) (although apparently standard now among many Korean places?!) \n\nFREE RICE REFILLS. About ~$12-17 per person, depending on what you get.\n\nBottom line - do your tummy a favor and come here and get a bowl of chigae. It's an amazing place to come on a cold night around midnight when you just crave something hot to eat. During your meal, look out at the deserted Geary Blvd., and have a pensive conservation with your dining partner. (in all our history of eating here, we've never seen the place more than 3 tables full - and this is including meals before 9! - often it's just you, her, and the empty dining room)\n\nBut really, take a moment to appreciate this dedicated Korean lady's cooking. It's fairly excellent, and I can't imagine how she keeps a restaurant running day after day till the wee hours of 2 AM. Looking at her cautiously lock the front door between customers after 11 PM, I wonder how and why she keeps this restaurant going. But lets not speculate - perhaps all you need to know is simply contained in those piping stone pots - all those solitary nights condensed into countless bowls of warm tofu chigae.", "author": "Chris S."}

This was our third attempt at finding Korean food since Muguboka on Balboa was closed, and Han Il Kwan had too long of a wait.\n\nBANCHAN:\nI really enjoyed the banchan here. They only gave 6 dishes, but they were quality ones and I enjoyed all of them. We did have to ask for refills, which was alright.\n\nSERVICE: \nA bit slow. There was one server tending to five tables. Don't hesitate to ask for anything.\n\nFOOD:\nTwo girlfriends and I shared:\n- 2 Spicy Tofu Soups with Beef: Unfortunately they only have one level of spiciness -- spicy. I didn't mind, I like it spicy, but my friends were a bit disappointed they didn't have any options. They were able to handle it though. They add the raw egg and also came with two bowls of rice.\n- Japchae: It was good. Nothing mindblowing fantastic.\n\nThe food was good.

Seven hungry girls circled for half an hour around Geary to find parking to eat here after venturing on yelp for a good Korean spot to hit. One of our girls was craving seafood pancake. \n\nConsensus of the group was not good. I can say this with confidence because amongst the 7 of us, we ordered half the menu + beer + yogurt soju. \n\nLets start with the alcohol (of course!!) -- This definitely isn't a place to drink at. Although they have Cass and OB beer (essentials of a korean restaurant. if they don't serve this at your korean place, get out. get out now!), their yogurt soju is lacking. It was way too sweet and lacked alcohol content. Not to mention, the bottle was small and we had to  ordered so many just to stay hydrated ..ironic but true. hydrated. \n\nFoodwise:\nKimchee fried rice - super bland, and not enough kimchee. All there was was red pasty rice with chopped white onion. Where is the kimchee?\nThey must make their own kimchee, because it doesn't seem fermented long enough to have the right acidic taste. There literally was no taste to it; it was just red paste slapped on lettuce leaves. \n\nKimchee soup - terrible. Salty, red pasted onion filled terribleness. Because we didn't get any water, I dumped tea into my soup twice to make it more watery and soup-like. \n\nSeafood pancake - average, too doughy and not enough content for my taste. There should be more green onion, and more seafood!\n\nChicken wings- average. Really average. \n\nBulgogi - Ok, pretty flavorful, and probably the best thing we got. \n\nThe side dishes were tiny, and we had to ask for them to be refilled. A lot of the expected flavors in Korean food just wasn't quite there at this place. I always think that if it was a legit Korean restaurant, a ton of Koreans would be there eating. That's when I feel satisfied I'm having an authentic experience. I noticed there were no korean people that came to eat in the 4 hour time frame that we were there.

Toyose is the natural default for us, but without a reservation, good luck with the wait when you drop in.  Playground and Arang are our good alternatives, but they usually draw a crowd as well (haven't been to The Spot yet either, but I know it's busy there too).  Thankfully, there's this hidden little gem in the outer Richmond that can offer those drinks and more without any hassles.\n\nDriving down Geary, it's pretty easy to just blow right by Um Ma Son without even seeing it.  However, should you happen upon it, you'll find a modest, cozy little place that serves some solid food.  The Dolsot Bibimbap is pretty good - good mix and serving size of veggies and meat.  Similarly, their haemul pajun (seafood pancake) is one of the better ones, considering how it's loaded with fillings and not too batter-heavy.  I think the one at Muguboka has a slight edge, but it's still really good here, so no complaints.\n\nOn the flip side, the Kimchi Fried Rice is a little uneven for me; the first time I had it was decent, but the most recent time it tasted a little off.  In either case though, there was a noticeable lack of beef, so that doesn't make me want to try it again.  Also, they have pictures on the wall of fried chicken on the menu, but when we tried to order some with our drinks, we couldn't tell if she was saying they were just out, or if don't have wings in general.  Oh well.\n\nThere's a couple of other specialty house dishes they offer that were pretty good, but I can't remember their exact names.  However, the most notable one was the order of braised beef ribs with potatoes and carrot.  The meat was really flavorful, and I loved the sauce.  They give you a decent selection of banchan, but I feel like they used to offer more.  However, the last couple of trips here, the waitress gave our table a free plate of steamed dumplings, so I'm more than willing to make that trade!  And speaking of which, the service has always been friendly and nice.  There's never been a wait either, so we've never had a problem getting a table or feeling rushed out.

The line at Purple Kow was way too long, so we ended up walking in search of a Korean place that was open (this was around probably 11 PM). Walking past George Washington High School, we finally arrived at Um Ma Son (Mama's Hands?) and were (surprisingly) warmly welcomed (unlike that OTHER Korean place that turned us away an hour before their reported closing time...)\n\nWe were immediately seated, brought tea and water, and our order was taken very promptly, but not hurriedly so. The waitress and who I assumed was the jumo were very courteous the entire time. We ordered a seafood pancake and most of us ordered a stone pot bibimbap. I initially wanted just a regular bibimbap, but the waitress insisted it would not be any extra trouble or take much longer to have it stone pot style. Yay!\n\nThe banchan was immediately brought out and dutifully refilled throughout our meal. The selection was typical, tasted great, and just what we wanted: assorted greens, bean sprouts, fish cake, kimchi, kakddugi, spicy pickled cucumbers, the works. By no means your typical 20-dish spread you'd find in an LA Korean place, but who needs black beans anyways?\n\nThe seafood pancake came out extremely well - I believe it's this place's specialty. Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside, not too greasy either. The seafood was spread pretty evenly and was not lacking either. The stone pot bibimbap was pretty hefty on the vegetables without a whole lot of meat, but that's pretty typical. With regards to the food here, it's your typical above-average Korean place (I don't know if that makes sense to you, but it's best way I could put it). \n\nThe main reason this place gets 4 stars instead of just 3 is the surprisingly courteous service we received! We more or less expected to be greeted with scowls for coming out so late (as we were the only patrons other than a couple next to us who was having a lovely-smelling hotpot situation going on - not meant to sound like a sex thing), but much to our delight, the service was very courteous and fantastic. We definitely felt like we were being taken care of, and the service and food live up to the restaurant's name.", "author": "Andrew C."}

She suggested the \"pancake\" appetizer and a noodle dish with beef and vegetables. That dish had very little meat on it though. We also ordered Yogurt Soju too which tasted very good. Almost close to the \"Yakult\" drinks you can get at the Asian supermarkets.

Moist fried rice with beef and a beautiful fried egg on top.  Each piece of rice is covered with red kimchi sauce.  This was a hit at our table.\n\nFried Chicken Wings:  Something about the batter.  So crunchy, with just the right amount f seasoning.  The meat was so juicy.  \n\nSeafood Pancake:  I just can't get enough of this dish.  Although it's made with flour, it didn't taste heavy.  Lots of substance in this huge group-friendly appetizer!\n\nSpicy Rice Cake with Pork:  Initially I though I was ordering ddukbokki, but it's slightly different.  Unlike ddukbokki, this dish is not sweet, but has a \"pickled\" flavor.  I still enjoyed it nonetheless.  \n\nService here is great.

They had 2 people working for the entire restaurant.  Granted it's a small mom and pop shop with about a handful of tables, but the restaurant was filled around 730pm.  Service and quality of food greatly suffered.  The main waitress was very stressed and she made everyone aware.  It was like watching a bad replay of Diner Dash.  I saw a couple walk out because their patience ran out.  She would slam the plates down and her anxiety made us feel very uncomfortable.  I felt like a child and listening to my parents argue.  The other lady was a boss (props) and doubled as the chef and waitress but the results was noticeable in the food.   Most of our meal was overcooked.  It was probably the worst kalbi I've ever had.  Dry, shriveled, lackluster meat.  And WTF over $20 for that little meat???  The seafood pancake was decent.  The dok bok ki was missing a certain flavor and were not in the usual shape of a round stick.  The mackerel was ridiculously oily and overdone.

Maybe they went easy on the spice because I'm not Korean?  Even though Japanese usually can't, I can handle my spicy food.  When I asked if they could make it hotter, the waitress looked at me and giggled slightly while taking it to the kitchen.

I brought family and friends and each time I came I was greeted with a warm smile like I was family and she was my distant grandma I don't get to visit so often. \n\nWhen you order the food its made and served at a decent pace. What do you expect though she runs the entire restaurant HERSELF! Amazing. I don't know how old she is but at her age managing, waiting tables, and cooking...WoW.\n\nFood is really good. Tastes like family cooked meals made by a loving mother. My mother is the best cook in my opinion but this lady's cooking reminds me of my mom's love in her cooking. Yes I'm a momma's boy. \n\nPrices are typical of a Korean restaurant a little steep but quality dishes.

I haven't really been out to one since I was with a couple of korean friends a couple years ago so I decided to go eat here. At first I was thinking of getting to a hotpot but I'll do that another time since that seems more like having to be with more that a couple people to enjoy. \n\nWhat to expect / what I had:\n\n- Seafood Paejun\n- Seafood Dolsot Bibimbap\n- bottle of Hite\n\nWell there was only one waitress and the owner which I think is a lady that ran the kitchen but man does she cook!!! Extremely well, considering the fact that I went out here on a solo mission. It wasn't a very crowded place and the setting was nice. When I came in the lady greeted me with a smile and had me sit anywhere I wanted. There was a couple that was in the restaurant before I was there other than that it was a well relaxed place to have something to eat late night.\n\nAs far as the yelp pictures helped me out in finding this place I gotta say that I was impressed from what a lady can do late night in a kitchen by herself. The waitress had sent out the banchan before my meal so I had the dried fish, fish cake and kimchi. The kimchi wasn't as spicy but I expect so from being a spicy dish. Either I became immune to spicy foods or its just me. \n\n Seafood Paejun was great I had a big one that took up the whole plate, I also had the Seafood Dolsot Bibimbap. I was a bit puzzled at first cause she had an egg yolk placed in there and the lady told me to stir while it was still sizzling :D\nAt first I had a tea to warm me up from the outside cause it was very cold.. but I swapped up since I was gonna eat big again and have my fill so I ordered a bottle of hite to go with my meal. For every 5 mins the lady would ask me if I ws doing alright. I was taking my time since I finished my Dolsot faster than I had my Paejun. I had to take half of it home cause I was stuffed afterwards. It was really great that I had a nice dinner and experience from just a waitress and a lady.

She slammed all her pots and pans when she cooked and served us and when we asked for rice she charged $3 for a tiny bowl!!! I've grown up with Korean food high and low end and the rice she gave us was definitely not worth $3. Our total came out to $160 for 3 dishes what the hell?! And might I add the food was old and was tasted like she kept it in the fridge and brought it out and microwaved it. The dok Bo ki was basically rice covered in ketchup. If I could give this 0 stars I would. If I were you I'd pass on this food-poisoned-hell-joint for mc Donald's. Don't be desperate.", "author": "Serena M."}

My friends and I had the BBQ Chicken, the Kalbi, the seafood pancake, and the dumpling soup. The seafood pancake was more than enough. It was very good and tasty. I love chicken so when the chicken came I was excited. The chicken was very well marinated with no MSG. The dumpling soup had a very nice broth.

She does basically everything! \n\nWe ordered the small kimchee pancake (but it was huge!) and the special Bi Bim Bap in the clay pot with the crack-added (I mean crackling) rice at the bottom.  The pancake was not overly doughy, could have been slightly crispier, but very good all the same. The BBB was delicious with a runny fried egg on top! She mixed it all up for us and we feasted. The lady even came by later to help us scrape the last yummy, crispy bits of rice at the bottom for us! There was plenty of food for two. I don't know what people are complaining about the small portions.\n\n I've overlooked this place so many times and I live just a few blocks away.

Seems like my general laziness has seeped into my Yelp life as well, since I've been resorting to obsessively checking in everywhere on my Yelp app (who checks in at U-Haul? Answer: Jen L. does.) to try to dominate the Yelposphere rather than writing helpful reviews for my adoring fans. I'm only now getting around to writing reviews again, specifically this one, out of sheer guilt.\n\nI came here for dinner with E about a week and a half ago and ever since I started eating healthy foods (veggie and whole grains) to avoid scathing remarks from my relatives regarding my weight (\"You've gotten so round!\") when I travel to China this summer, I've been a little...out of it (i.e., bumping into walls and muttering curses at romaine lettuce). Unfortunately, in my salad-induced haze, I somehow suppressed my innate Asian mathematical aptitude and calculated tip incorrectly, giving the sweet woman who works here less than 15% tip.\n\nE pointed this out later that night and I vowed to write a review for Um Ma Son to try to compensate for my accidental stinginess. (That said, I won't let my overwhelming guilt bias my review or taint my Yelp integrity!) I'll admit that we had originally set out to dine at Han Il Kwan, my favorite Korean joint in the city, but when we drove by, we saw that Han Il Kwan was undergoing some construction so we decided to try out Um Ma Son since it was closeby and seemed to get rave reviews on Yelp.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were greeted by a cute little Korean woman. She apparently does all the cooking and waitressing herself (OH THE GUILT!), but we didn't have any issues with waiting too long for our food and she was still very attentive, checking up on us several times and cooing over E and his love for Korean food.\n\nWe got the seafood pancake, kimchi fried rice, and yuk gae jang (spicy beef stew), and everything was yummy. I would definitely say that I prefer the kimchi fried rice at Toyose, since the one here was a bit too oily, which diluted the kimchi taste. I loved the side dishes here though, they were definitely simple but very flavorful and home-y. \n\nI'd definitely come back when I'm in the mood for homestyle Korean cooking. I love Han Il Kwan, but it definitely has a restaurant vibe and taste (if that even makes sense at all...is this the salad talking again?). Um Ma Son (which roughly translated means \"Mother's Hand\") feels more like a private dining room and it tastes more like the food I used to have at home. Comforting, delicious, and guilt-ridden.", "author": "Jen L."}

Their menu is pretty small compared to the bigger Korean restaurants but as long as they have what I want, I'm happy... \n\nI wanted to try the seafood pancake but knew I wouldn't finish it so I just ordered the Kalbi ($18.95) and the BF ordered the Kim Chee Bok Um Bap(Kim chee fried rice with beef and egg $9.95). The little dishes given wasn't as much as I though it would be but it was good and when the Kalbi came, I scarfed that yummy thing down as if I haven't eaten in days/weeks.. Plenty of meat but not enough for how much you pay for. The meat itself was tender and flavorful but it's just too expensive... The kim chee fried rice was another story. It tasted so weird I couldn't even take two bites. The beef didn't even exist... If you try this and think you can handle SPICY, make sure you have lots of ice water because it is REALLY spicy....\n\nNext time maybe I'll give the Bi Bim Bap($9.95) a try since it looks really good when I was taring at the other patrons eating it!\n\nOPEN TIL 2 IN THE MORNING!", "author": "Juliane N."}

The rice was barely warm. I would prefer it a little bit warmer. The side dishes (i.e. kim chi, bean sprout, cucumbers, tofu skin, anchovies, and daikon radish) were okay. The kim chi wasn't very spicy. The bean sprout was really salty. Cucumbers had too much sesame oil. Tofu skin has a bit too much anchovy paste. Daikon radish tasted a little funny; maybe it was just a not-so-great radish. Beef bulgogi was very tender. A tad too sweet for my taste. Jap Chae was really sweet and kind of watery; good flavor though, maybe just had one too many tablespoons of sauce. Soon Dofu was good. I would like a bit more broth. A little bit too salty; good with rice. ;)\n\nService was great. The lady was very friendly and attentive. She came over to scoop our soup for us.

The kim-chee fried rice here is meh, it was a bit too greasy and buttery for my liking. The restaurant is really cute and small. The pricing is your typical korean food in SF pricing. The downside about this restaurant is that when it gets hectic you will not get what you ask for from the servers. The service can get very slow and annoying because there's only one person serving and one person cooking. There are a lot of people that order take-outs too , so your food might take awhile to come. Also parking is awful on geary =[. Amidst all of the bad stuff I would still come back.", "author": "Lucy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-05", "description": "I was hoping to find a back up to my fave Richmond K joint, Han Il Kwan, but Um Ma Son comes up short.\n\nI really, really, really, want to support the place as it's a small local biz, but they need some help to differentiate themselves from other Korean restaurants.\n\nMy meh dining experience started when I tried to order yuk gae jang because I wanted a simple, hearty, spicy soup to chase off yet another cold and miserable rainy night in SF. But alas, DENIED. I think that was the first time ever that I went to a K joint and was told they couldn't make yu gae jang, which almost sounds like they don't get enough orders for the dish to keep ingredients around.\n\nAfter this denial, I began to wonder if the restaurant had enough traffic to sustain itself for the long haul, as the place was nearly empty at around 8:30 in the evening.\n\nMaybe I can also sense the air of desperation in the place, considering they currently have a half-off happy hour liquor deal after 10PM. Yes, boys and girls, happy hour AFTER 10PM.\n\nSo I ordered the following instead for me and my dining companion:\n\n- Kimchi Bok Um Bap\n\nSimple prep of kimchi fried rice made with kimchi stir fried with rice with grilled egg on top. It was good and decent, but not much better than what I can whip up at home on my own.\n\n- Kimchi chee gae\n\nIt was piping hot and spicy, filled chock full of kimchi and pork, but the broth lacked the depth of flavor I find at places like Shin Toe Bul Yi and Han Il Kwan. I think the portion size was slightly smaller as well.\n\n- Fried chicken (not on menu, picture on wall)\n\nNot as good as the KFC at Shin Toe Bul Yi, but it was pleasant enough fried chiken. Not too spicy (surprising), and served with something that tasted like a mixture of Thai/Vienamese chili sauce and kochujang.\n\nThere were 7 banchan selections served with our meal. Pretty standard fare stuff like cucumber, water radish, bean sprout, kimchi, anchovy, and fish cake. The curveball was the pickled deulkkae leaves which would have gone well with meat, which we didn't order. I was disappointed that they didn't serve ggak du gi.\n\nThere were more options on the menu, including $20+ jungol type dishes, but we took a pass on them on this visit as we were in the mood for a simple dinner that was light on meat.\n\nThe dining room is small and intimate, so it could be a really cozy place for a good meal. And with umma's (presumably the proprietor) gracious and attentive service (not creepy at all you haters), it could be a really awesome experience.\n\nUnfortunately, there are much better options.\n\nI think Um Ma Son can do much better if they can improve on the formula at Toyose in outer Sunset. If a place like that can thrive in a converted garage for chrissakes, Um Ma Son can do better by tweaking their menu and serve more dishes like they have in Korean hofs or even street food and courting a hipster clientele with kiddie soju drinks.", "author": "Bono B."}

Amateur.\n\nAs the name of this restaurant translate's to \"Mom's Hand,\" and with the traditional stews and dishes hard to find elsewhere in Frisco, I hate to short Um Ma Son 2 stars.  The food however, is extremely hit or miss, and the barren restaurant on Saturday night \"dinner rush\" hours belies the high star ratings from my fellow yelpers.\n\nService: Being the only table from 7-8:30 on Saturday, the service from the ah-ju-mah (elderly lady) became borderline obtrusive and slightly awkward.  While service checks and smiles are key to successful customer service, asking if everything is okay after every 3 bites proves difficult to hold conversation with your company.\n\nFood:  \n*The CODFISH STEW is delicious.  Boiled till bubbling right on your table, the stew refreshes and comforts by way of the asian radish and meaty cod harmony.  A perfect remedy for the cold inner Richmond summer evenings.  Careful of bones though!\n\n*Jap Chae - Well known to any Korean food fanatic, this common noodle appetizer was drowning in soy sauce and oil, lacked necessary vegetables, and had one too many unwarranted shakes of black pepper.  Major miss.\n\n*Kim chi Pancake - Crisp on the outside and hot on the inside (good). Kimchi flavors lacking and slightly awry.  Something to eat if you're bored.  (Hit/miss)\n\n*Ban Chan (side dishes) - Miss. Miss. Miss. Kimchi - def not made by MY mama's hands.  I pity the fool...\n\n*Soft Tofu Soup - Tastes like: water, red chili pepper flakes, soft tofu.  No soothing complexities.  Stops boiling in clay pot way too soon.  Miss.\n\nAmbiance:  On one hand, there's something royal about being the only guest in a small restaurant for your entire meal with full attention from your server.  On the other hand, it's very weird/creepy.\n\nWill definitely be go back on a depressing day for the Cod Fish stew, otherwise, it's bust.\n\n$9-20 ave. per dish.

Nevertheless, both soups certainly came out tasting like they were made by mother herself so I didn't mind!  \n\nYukgaejang (ordered extra spicy) had a beefy, deliciously red, deep taste.

He never cooks for himself and eats out all the time ('spensive!).\n\nWe took a late nap and slept through dinner. By the time we thought to eat dinner, it was already past 9:30PM. Now, in Santa Cruz, or another places, the only options open would be diners. This is what I love about city life, like LA, there's always a plethora of options for food late at night.\n\nWe wanted to go some place close, and he seriously lives about 2-3 blocks away. AND this place is open until 2AM! \n\nWe missed the place and had to turn around to find it. The lights that illuminate the sign were off, so it wasn't very noticeable. Luckily we got a spot right out front (parking is another thing that keeps me from coming out to SF very often).\n\nUpon entering, the place was small (probably seats 50ish), but pretty full for a late night dinner. The vibe of the place was nice and was very clean. We were seated promptly by the \"um-ma.\" Seeing all the different foods people were ordering looked delicious.\n\nThe prices on the menu are kind of up there, but then it looked as though the portions were enough for two, so then it's not so bad. He ordered the dol sot bibimbap. I had the ya chae soondubu.\n\nIt amazed me that there were only two people working, \"um-ma\" and the \"ap-pa\" (as Colleen L. called him). Hardcore seeing that they stay up that late Tuesday through Saturday just to serve people food. Really awesome and fortunate for the late night eaters.\n\nThe food was definitely yummy. My friend enjoyed his food (though he didn't care much for my beloved beansprout ends). I liked my soondubu. I didn't realize that there was mushrooms in it, which strongly flavored the soup, but I picked them all out, which actually significantly reduced the mushroom flavor. But even with the mushroom flavor, it was a delicious, savory stew. The egg was even cracked in for me, something I typically make a mess of my hands doing!\n\nI am very pleasantly full from the yummy food here.

It was made with pieces of squid, green onion, egg batter, and comes with a dipping sauce. I thought the ratio of the ingredients was perfect and wasn't too greasy. I probably ate most of the pancake...oops!\n\nspicy soft tofu soup with beef - The soup came out still boiling in the bowl and it was perfectly spicy/flavored. The tofu was really silky, just the way I like it and there was a decent amount of ground beef in there. I kept coming back for more to put on my rice....mmm!\n\njap chae - This dish seemed a little too oily for some reason but was still super tasty. It's just like typical jap chae with clear rice noodles, shredded cabbage and carrots, mushrooms, and green onions.\n\ndae gee bulgogi - This was the spicy pork one and it was delicious!

No, Um Ma Son's show is way better than that baloney. Um Ma Son has a little mama-san who... answers the phone, greets you at the door, refills your water, takes your order, cooks your food, serves your food, wipes your tables, washes your dishes, runs your credit card, converses with you, rubs your belly and blows you kisses from across the kitchen. Okay I'm lying about the last two on that list, but really that one little old lady who runs this shop is definitely the show of the restaurant. If there was an award for \"Best Multitasker of All Time,\" she definitely would win it. I could not believe how one little old lady was capable of running this entire restaurant, while still managing to get everyone's food out without exceeding a 25 minute wait. Despite there being 6 other parties in the restaurant, this little old lady tended to everyone's needs punctually. Bravo!\n\nThe food was acceptable, however little old mama-san steered us away from our original orders. I'm not too sure if that was her tactic to make her multitasking run more smoothly, but she definitely manipulated us into making us order what she wanted to cook. We wanted to order the grilled short ribs (kalbi), but she made us order the steamed chopped short ribs instead. We wanted to order the fried potstickers (mandu), but she insisted on having us order the steamed potstickers instead. In the words of mama-san, \"ohhh no, dis wan bet-tah!\" followed by an irresistible old lady smile. Hmm, was little mama-san trying to make her workload more easier? I think so! But I don't blame her since she was a one man team. The food was ordinary. Nothing mind blowing. The kalbi was flavorful, however if it was the actual short ribs with the middle bone, I think I would've enjoyed them more. The mandu were tasty, however they lacked that crispy crunch I was craving that the fried mandu would have provided. The Kimchee fried rice was so-so, but it worked as a good filler between the mandu and kalbi. Some of the side dishes (banchan) were delicious, while some others looked like baby fetus parts.

We were the only people there at the time, and after saying a few words to the chief/server in Korean about how tasty the food was, I think I became her honorary grandson.

I think they've been open for about four months. I go inside around 7pm and I'm the only guest. I ordered the meal that I was craving for and while I was waiting, to my happy surprise, I was served complimentary tea and soup while I waited for my hot, steaming pot of beef, vegetables and egg. The bottom of the pot had crunchy rice just like I wanted. They served 7 side dishes to be eaten with the entree: pickled cucumber, pickled radish, kimchi, pickled sesame leaves, garlic bean sprouts, sauteed fish cakes and spicy anchovies.\r\n\r\nWhen I first saw the bowl, I thought that there wouldn't be enough rice for all the food. But by the time I've eaten half of it, I started to feel really full. I still ate the whole thing, happily stuffed, since taking it to go wouldn't taste as good. When the bill came, I was served desert, also complimentary. The waitress was really nice too. She spoke good Korean as some native customers came in for a meal. \r\n\r\nThe lady sitting behind a counter went into the kitchen and started cooking for me. When she was done she came back out and watched to see if I was enjoying it from the counter. This just showed how much there care about the reactions of customers. I read in Chowhound that the mother is the cook and the daughter is the waitress.\r\n\r\nI know it's a little ambitious to give a restaurant four stars after only one visit, but this place is really nice to come to when you just want good homemade Korean cooking. The only down side is that the kimchi and pickled dishes weren't that spicy for me. They were flavorful but I felt like there may have been too much garlic and it made me want to go home right away to brush my teeth.\r\n\r\nBi bim bop around $9.95 for dinner.

Good business choice for them, though because I'm sure I'm not the only customer who gets full on kimchi and fish cakes.\nI had the Vegetarian Tofu Stew (which is a misnomer because I can taste the fish broth; not that I'm complaining about it - just letting the vegetarians know if this is a problem for you) - the egg is already in the bowl when they bring it to you - I guess that's better, but a) I like the ritual of doing it myself and b) what if I was scared of eggs right now? The broth was surprisingly soupy for how spicy it was. Big chunks of zucchini was the supporting character to the Tofu. It was not bad, but not the best I've had either.\nMy date had the Dolsot BiBimbap. He got a tablespoon's equivalent of meat in that large bowl - this wouldn't have bothered me, but I know he'd prefer that the meat was served up in the same quantity as each of the servings of vegetables in the bowl. Oh, and the kochujang was really watered down.\n\nSERVICE .5 star\nI can't tell if the girl who served us genuinely didn't understand us or just decided that she couldn't before she even approached us, but seems like it definitely set the stage for the level of service we received.\n\nWhen the bibimbap came, I asked for some kochujang for my date and she looked at me confused. Then I showed a squeezing motion with my hand over his bowl, followed by the words \"Kochujang\" (I said it twice first pronouncing the first letter as a K, then as a G) and \"Sauce?\" (yes, said with a question mark). Then, without acknowledgement, she walked off and I could hear her saying \"sauce\" to the lady in the kitchen who then walked out to find the Kochujang at another table and delivered it to us.\nI asked that same server for an egg, making a cracking motion over my boiling soup when she brought my tofu stew.

I really liked the feel of the restaurant at the first glance -- it was a cozy and a nice middle age woman welcomed us in. I was unimpressed by the appetizers there were two bean sprouts one original and one spicy so the variety was lacking.  I ordered three dishes that have been raved about on yelp: the seafood pancake, the kimchee soup with rice, and bi bim bap. The sea food pancake  was fine. The bi bim bap was also fine, although it was bland and seriously had two tiny pieces of meat in it. So I guess it's good if you want to go vegetarian. The kimchee soup was AWFUL. It was so salty I had to drain the rice from the soup in order to eat it. And again it had two small pieces of meat. I thought it was strange why the woman hadn't asked me if I wanted beef or pork, I guess it doesn't matter since you can't really see or taste it anyway. This is all taking into accountr that I hadn't eaten all day and I would have tolerated any decent food, but this was just really sub par. \n\nAs we got ready to ready, we gave her a $40 for our meal of $34.50. we  waited for 5-10 minutes until we realized that she wasn't going to give us change. When  we did ask for change, she deliberately gave us a $5 bill and 50 cents which forced us to tip ~18%. \n\nI think this restaurant has definitely turned me off from Korean food for a while.", "author": "Lily Z."}

Don't get me wrong.  I love all types of kimchi, whether it is my mom's, fresh, a week old, jarred, homemade, or winter kimchi (super fermented and saved to eat in the winter when there is limited fresh cabbage to make fresh kimchi).  This kimchi went untouched.  The rest of the panchan (the collection of side dishes you receive with entrees) was mediocre.\n\nI ordered the chapchae (glass noodles) and dueje bulgogi (spicy pork).  The dueje bulgogi was OK.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  The chapchae was off.  I wouldn't recommend ordering it.\n\nAs for the service, for a small location, service was very slow.  It was about half full.  I know that it is a mother-daughter duo running it, and it was really cute to hear the daughter calling to her mother everytime customers left so the mother could say goodbye to each customer.  I'm very understanding and accommodating when a restaurant is busy, as I have worked in a restaurant.   But the service was ridiculous.  \n\nI will not go back there.

Of the handful of Korean restaurants I've been to in city, I'd have to say I like the side dishes here the best....fresh kimchi, seasoned bean sprouts, spicy fish cakes, and so on.  Our server (who also cooked our food...I think she was the owner) was incredibly sweet and often came back to see if we liked the food and to refill our drinks.  \n\nNow on to the main dishes.  I had the bibimbap and my boyfriend had the bulgogi.  We both felt these were just all right.  The egg in the bibimbap was barely cooked (like flame kissed) and both the egg white and yolk were runny, which made me somewhat concerned.  I didn't get dolsot bibimbap either, so its not like the egg got a chance to cook later on.  Though there were a variety of ingredients, I didn't feel the bibimbap had a lot of flavor and had to add a lot of hot sauce to get some taste to it.  My boyfriend thought his bulgogi was all right, but kind of bland.  Then again, we are both from LA and haven't yet come across a Korean restaurant in the Bay thats as good as those in the LA K-town.\n\nThough we weren't really impressed with the main dishes, we'd go back for the great service, the side dishes and to give it another try.

Came in for dinner literally starving after a day of fasting and got a table by myself. Waitress gave me some tea and a menu and then proceeded to ignore me for the next 15 minutes. What happened next might have been amusing had I not been so hungry. I flagged down the waitress and asked if I could order and pointed to the menu. Clearly her English skills weren't top notch, since she proceeded to bring me a glass of water. Sort of rhymes I guess.  I asked again and she appeared not to understand that I was there to eat and not drink tea and water and stare at the menu all night. Ten minutes later, I grabbed the other waitress and asked if I could order. She brought over a note pad but no pen, started to chuckle, left and proceeded to help other customers. I have in the past felt on rare occasions, some sense of discrimination for being a Caucasian customer in a basically Asian oriented restaurant, but never like this. It did appear that a group of probably Korean women who walked in well after me and knew the waitress, were about to get served before me. One would have to conclude that they didn't want to serve me, since they were competent enough to serve others there. I tried to figure out how I had offended them by asking to order, but Hunger got the better of me and I had to bail, but let some customers who were waiting outside know what they could expect, like I'm telling you right here.", "author": "Barry F."}

The portions of the sides seemed a bit small since there were two orders made, but they were good none the less.  I'll come back to try the seafood pancake and kim hcee fried rice.  Another plus is that Um Ma Son is open late hours so many thanks for satisfying my late night food runs.", "author": "LittleBird 8."}

The place was empty when we came around 7, and only a few other people came after us for dinner. I hate when Korean restaurants skimp on their little appetizer dishes, but the ones that came out were all pretty decent. We ordered the BBQ pork (bul go gi) which you can never go wrong with. However, the spicy rice cake dish (duk bok ki?) wasn't quite what I expected. I like when it comes as like long cylinders of rice cake, but this place had flat pancake pieces. I guess this is just a personal preference, but I've definitely had the dish with better flavors at other places.", "author": "Jeffrey T."}

I came here with a friend who never really had Korean food before, besides bulgogi. We came here a bit after they just opened, so it was empty; & were greeted by a very sweet ahjumma (middle aged woman), who happened to be the cook & waiter as well! Triple threat! In addition to banchan (Korean side dishes), my friend & I both ordered bibimbap, except mines was in a stone pot, & ddubokki. I've had bibimbap at other places before, but Um Ma Son's was off the hook. My friend who barely finishes her food actually finished her bibimbap. The ddubokki was really good as well. However, there weren't much selection in the side dishes. Service was good too; maybe it was 'cause we were the only ones in there, but was really friendly. Food did take awhile to come out, but then again, the ahjumma was by herself. It was reasonably priced for a Korean restaurant. The place is fairly small; so come with a date, a small group of friends, or by yourself. I'll probably come back again just for the bibimbap, or maybe to try the soup.", "author": "BrendaJoy G."}

That is new for a Korean restaurant in the Bay Area. \n\nWe ordered dol-sot-bi-bim-baap (rice cooked in a stone pot and then mixed with vegetable and hot sauce) and kim-chi-tsi-kae (spicy cabbage pickle casserole). Both were almost as good as the same dishes form anywhere else we've tried all around the Bay Area.  \n\nBan-chaan (side dishes) cannot be described as of generous proportion or varied.
