There is everything one's heart could desire for take away.  The prices are very reasonable!  The Dim Sum is always fresh and sooo tasty!\n\nThis is an easy exit off of 19th and if you get there before 10, you can usually find a parking space.  They also have the two types of Chinese tamales - wrapped in bamboo leaves and wrapped in lotus leaves.  Sofie and I took some home to eat for dinner.  A complete meal that only requires being steamed.  Directions: place in your InstaPot, press \"steam\", wait for the beeper, serve and eat!  Delicious!\n\nPeople are friendly and don't mind if you do not speak Chinese and say, \"Those, those and some of those; and that one too!  4 of 'em!\".  If you want to learn Chinese, they will tell you the names gladly.\n\nJust say: \"Saam go gin doy!\" and you will be presented with three delicious sesame seed balls - crisp sesame dough on the outside filled with sweet and flavorful sesame seed paste.  My favorite dessert after enjoying the meat filled tasties.", "author": "Steve S."}

I came here with a friend and I love how you can order pieces of a item as oppose to getting an order where it comes with 3 dumplings or whatever (3 dumplings for $2.55 so if you get 1 dumpling it's just a 1/3 of the price). Everything taste just as good as any dim sum restaurant. The food was quite fresh and some of the items were huge like the buns. Well worth it! There was a gentleman worker who constantly pushed a kart of food to the front. That guy was hilarious because the store isn't very big but as he made his way to the front he would make a beep beep noise to clear the way. \n\nWhen we got here there was already a good size line inside that went all the way to the back. The total wait was probably about 15-20 minutes. You can get the food togo or dine in, there are several tables and they provide you with utensils. The ketchup bottle is a chili sauce and yellow is a soy or vinegar sauce. A coin flip with the yellow bottom. \n\nWouldn't have asked for a better dim sum experience.

Which is pretty standard for any dim sum place. We got 27 dumplings and 6 pork buns for $25!! (3 dumplings for $2.55). The siu mai and ha gao dumplings were bigger than expected and we all got full very quickly. \n\nUnlike the typical dim sum restaurant, this place is a take-away shop. You're given all your dishes at once rather than intermittently by people pushing carts. This place is also cash only so come prepared! There's a Walgreens across the street with an ATM, but there's a $3 withdrawal fee.\n\nOverall, this place is delicious, definitely worth every penny and struggle to find street parking.

I love the shrimp and pork dumplings, steamed BBQ pork buns, and turnip cake. The soy sauce on the tables is super delicious. It's sweet and slightly tangy. Make the perfect dipping sauce by adding some of the chili sauce they offer too. \n\nSure customer service is lacking and the store looks run down but that's nothing surprising in my opinion. I feel like that's very typical for dank Chinese\u200b joints so I never really take that into account when reviewing a place like this.

As I followed a friend who was loading up on goodies this past weekend, I decided to purchase a baked pork bun as my litmus test to their offerings. The pork bun is average in size and when I broke it open saw that it was filled with very red sauce and meat. Upon my first bite I thought to myself, \"OMG, this is really sweet.\"\nIndeed, expecting a slight sweetness as well as savory elements, the stark sweetness of GL's pork bun was quite offputting. Not to be defeated, I did eat the entire bun before coming to a decision. I don't like sweet pork buns at all.

Undercooked pork? If so, not good! It was a little worrisome for me, but it's been about 24 hours later, and all is good. Thank goodness, but I can still see that slightly pink center in my minds' eye. I have been nuking the leftovers through and through! I've never seen a pink center in dumplings before. In fact, they tend to be overlooked sometimes.  Having said that, the fillings were tasty, and the wrappings on all the dim sum held up well, and didn't fall apart.\n\nI disliked the fun gor though. The pork filling had a strange texture, which was slightly gravy-like, as if they over did it with the water and cornstarch. It's unfortunate, as I really liked the texture of the fun gor wrapper, which was perfect, just like grandma would've made.\n\nWhat I did like was the steamed ricke cake (Bhak tong go). Theirs was fresh, nicely thin and very moist. It's difficult to make correctly, and I might return for this, if I was in the area.\n\nI had fairly high expectations for Good Luck Dim Sum, after all I've been reading about it. In retrospect though, I wish I would've dug a little deeper, as there are quite a few recent one-star reviews.

We wanted something cheap, filling, and quick and I didn't have any interest sitting in a dim sum restaurant with crowded carts and inattentive service. So I relied on trusty Yelp and discovered Good Luck Dim Sum! Unlike Good Mong Kok Bakery (also considered) this place has a dine in option which was crucial for us as the weather was looking bad and we didn't want to eat dim sum in our car. \n\nUpon arriving, I thought there would a menu which I can circle the ones I wanted and how many but it was just a take out menu. Nonetheless we ended up ordering:\n\nChicken Siu Mai & Beef Siu Mai - both were average to me because they were a little drier than I'm used to but it was still good. I preferred the beef and my boyfriend referred the chicken.\n\nDumplings - we ordered the shrimp one & the shrimp and chive one. Both were fresh and delicious! I would recommend getting these.\n\nSteamed Buns- tried the BBQ pork one and the chicken one. Both were delicious! The BBQ pork one is legit not like the super fake red coloring  one you usually get elsewhere and decent sized pork pieces. The chicken one was seasoned ground chicken although was missing some peas or an egg which is what I usually prefer. \n\nChicken sticky rice - this was average! I've had better back in San Jose. Too much rice compared to chicken ratio but it was cooked right. It is wrapped in banana leaf or lotus leaf or something. Obviously don't eat that part. It had one small slice of Chinese sausage for the whole thing.\n\nPotstickers - not really memorable at all. Not hot and no crispy. Pass.\n\negg rolls- I don't recommend as it was cold, didn't have much filling, and really greasy. Also pass. \n\nRed bean Fried Sesame ball- bomb! Hot fresh and crispy. 80 cents each. Wish I got more.\n\nI would normally give this place 3 stars but rounded up to 4 because all of this was under $25 for two big eaters and we had 3 chicken steamed buns and 3 pieces of chicken Siu Mai after! \n\nThey pile everything on a paper plate and give you two little paper boat trays to eat and it's on a kitchen lunch tray if you dine in. Be sure to be clear about 1 order vs 1 piece when you pick which ones you want. We came at 11:11 AM on a Monday and some items were sold out and some of the food was cold. Takeout boxes are 20 cents each. At the tables there was a sweeter thick soy sauce and chili sauce to eat with everything. There's a sign to clean up after yourself and throw away your plate.

Especially if you are more of a newbie to dim sum or can get intimidated by somewhat crass Chinese ladies, just get the piece of paper and make your order that way (circle and indicate how many) - it doesn't matter whether you're eating in or out, they'll still take it that way. \n\nAs someone who grew up going to LA Chinatown on a weekly basis, I think that this is some solid dim sum, but neither is it like a heavenly offering. In a blind taste test, there would be no way to differentiate most of their items; an exception would be the turnip cake, which had some other bits of other things in there, which I see less often at other places. Even the ratios of things are similar. This is more or less why this is a 4-star review for me.\n\nParking is not always easy (and is metered). Seating inside is fairly limited and not good for groups over 4. One downside to getting all of this at once, rather than over time via the cart-delivery system, is that the end of your meal will probably be rather room temperature, so think carefully about what you order and the order in which you eat it.

Microwaved dim sum from a dim sum spot, which allegedly is one of the best in San Francisco, is super lame! The same goes with the rest of the dim sum. It's hit or miss and often needs to be nuked.

The egg tarts were great, the crust super flaky with the right amount of sweetness. The shumai's were OK, to me it was too dense and kinda dry. The har gao was great though I kept biting into REALLY large pieces of strong ginger. The wrapped sweet rices were good, a meal in itself. It wasn't all great though, I HATED the taro shrimp dumpling. It was huge and not only had a taro paste with shrimp, it had LARGE pieces of cilantro which makes me gag thinking about it.

I honestly loved their dipping sauce as well mixed with some chili sauce to kick it up a notch. ($2.20)\n\nSteamed BBQ bun was ok (not enough meat inside) but for the price you get what you pay for pretty much. ($2.20)\n\nDumplings were huge and same as above 3 pieces per order. It was good for the price. ($2.20)\n\nSweet rice stuffed with crushed peanuts and coconut (very tasty) $1 \n\nCons:\n\nBaked BBQ bun (I really wanted to love this cause this is my fave from mayflowers or any other dim sum places). But the bread and filling ratio was 80% bread 20% meat. I love bread but the filling wasn't that great (it was just ok). ($1)\n\nEgg roll was blah (3 for $2.20)\n\nEgg tart was ok ($1 each)\n\nAnother dumpling with green onion and meat inside (gross according to my bf and friends) 3 for $2.20\n\nThe service was good and all but our server lady had the worst attitude. This place gets really packed and I bet she is tired considering it is Chinese New Year's Day. I asked her for how much my friend's order since they only accept cash only she straight up gave me an attitude saying \"I don't know I didn't help her. I only added yours. Next time you tell me you pay together.\" She Rolled her eyes after when I said we just read it's cash only.. so anyways My bf paid for our food and we just handed our friend cash to pay for her food separately since it was such a big deal. \n\nBottom line this place is popular for the price and some of their yummy selections but the service is definitely not it lol..

Since I work all the way out in Dublin this was a big treat. As testament to how good the stuff is, I sent a text out to my coworkers to help themselves to dim sum, stepped away from my desk for about 15 minutes and returned to find only a single pot sticker and two shrimp har gows left?!?!  \n\nFlash forward today, we dropped a friend off at SFO And I took the opportunity to get more on Thanksgiving day.  The hubs and I drove up and quickly found parking on the street, I figured there be a line but I had no clue that the line would be so long!  By the time I made it up to the counter they were out of shrimp har gow, Chinese donuts and baked pork buns?!?!  Since the food is always coming out I learned that my wait was a good 5 to 15 minutes, The lady helping me at the counter wasn't sure.  So I got what I could and then returned straight to the counter with my container to have it filled up with the good stuff 15 minutes later.  \n\nThe hubs and I took our loot to GGP, now that's a Thanksgiving brunch.", "author": "Ann T."}

Wish they had a sweet and sour or some sauce for the egg rolls but I didn't see any.  The big disappointment here is the pork buns (especially the baked) were our least favorite of any of the places we tried (it had a sweet kinda sticky coating on top we didn't care for).

This place is pretty reasonably priced, costing around $2.40 per order of dim sum (three pieces per order).  I always hear good things about this place, but the food here to me isn't really that impressive.  It's certainly a big step down from dim sum you can find at actual restaurants, which was expected.  I usually order the siu mai and the shrimp dumplings here if I need a quick and cheap bite to eat.  \n\nThe siu mai are my favorite of the two - they're really plump and juicy here, but I do think they went a bit too far on the sodium/MSG with it.  The shrimp dumplings are not as good as the siu mai - the skin is usually not as soft as I'd like it to be, and the filling tastes okay.  \n\nOverall, the food is good if you lower your expectations a bit (think of this  as fast food instead of restaurant quality dim sum), but it's nothing amazing or special.", "author": "Tim L."}

The bready dough is glutinous and almost addictive in itself. ***1/2\n\n- Sweet Rice Puff w/Coconut, Peanuts is a surprising combination of flavors that works. The coconuts and peanuts add a crunchy, chewy texture that works nicely with the glutinous rice. I've never tried this taste before. ***1/2\n\n- Turnip Cake has an almost shrimp-like flavor, mild but appealing.

The location itself is pretty narrow and has limited seating. However, most people that venture here take their order to go. It's a quick operation that makes being in line not so bad. \n\nOnce you're inside, take one of the pink slips and pens to mark the items you want. This eliminates any potential language barriers, so it's positive for both sides! Three tiers are available: 3 for 2 dollar items, items for less than a dollar and then the a la carte items. I always go for the siu mai, fried stuffed dumplings, leek dumplings and the turnip cake because it makes you want to turn up! Eh eh!? Okay sorry. But I won't apologize for eating it all myself because the food is great. An added bonus is that it usually costs less than 10 dollars to get you full. If you're still hungry, I highly recommend the baked bbq buns. They're huge and the pork filling is better than most places around the city. \n\nThe women who keep the line moving are really nice. I'm not sure if they have any ownership but they definitely work like it's their store. If you're nice, they might just throw in some extra goodies. This assumes they've seen your face a bajillion times, which will likely happen because you'll come back after your first time here.", "author": "Quoc N."}

I've walked by this long-standing place dozens of times and always noticed the long lines. Funny thing is that I was either on my way to a meal or on my way home after just finishing one. Last Saturday, I was waiting for my car to be serviced when I finally decided yes, I would like to see what the fuss was about here. I didn't know the drill, and frankly everyone in line looked like they knew exactly what they wanted. When I noticed the pink sheet with all the dim sum choices, I was in a bit of a quandary how to order a mix of them until someone handed me a mini-golf pencil for me to circle my choices.\n\nNow here's the stupid part. When I read \"3 for $1.90\", I thought that meant I should choose three different dim sum. With that misconception in my head, I decided to circle six items in that section and add a Custard Tart and a Sweet Rice Bun for $0.90 each (photo: http://bit.ly/1Jv2Ghh). I was quite proud of my thoughtfully coordinated order when I submitted it to one of the three women who were a blur of kinetic energy as they masterfully grabbed the dim sum with their tongs from the various steam baskets and trays (photo: http://bit.ly/1A4n803). What immediately became clear to me was the \"3 for $1.90\" actually meant I was getting three of all six dim sum I ordered.\n\nThat meant I was getting a whopping 18 dim sum in one of those flimsy plastic to-go containers. I was too embarrassed to stop her. She filled that tray so fast that I didn't notice what a hefty bag of dim sum I was about to carry out the door. It was probably too humiliating for me to eat it there at one of the formica tables they have set up since they would have expected the rest of my baseball team to show up. So I lugged all that dim sum back to the waiting room of the car dealership: three Shrimp Dumplings, three Pork Siu Mai, three Beef Siu Mai, three Chicken Siu Mai, three Steamed Pork Dumplings, and three Potstickers (photo: http://bit.ly/1EvQnOK).\n\nIt was just $11.40 for all of that. Luckily, they were out of the sweet ones I ordered, or more likely, the woman felt I ordered enough and moved on to the next customer. You'll be happy to know there is a happy ending to my tragic mistake. As I sat waiting for my car to get ready, I only had time to try one of each kind as I originally intended and found them to be as tasty and abundant as I heard they were. As for the rest of them, I gave them to a young Chinese family who were waiting for their car. I explained my conundrum, and they were happy to take the rest off my hands. So my misfortune turned into someone else's good luck. It's called the Circle of Dim Sum. Seriously. Look it up.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...no matter how many you order, they're all warm and tasty\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...not much to say about this closet of a place except to say it works\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast, that's all\nTOTAL - 4 stars...now I know what the fuss is about but for Pete's sake, don't over-order like I did", "author": "Ed U."}

I got the Chinese sausage roll, egg custard bun, pork siu mai, har gow, and sticky rice. The dough on the buns was was starchy, fluffy and sweet, and I appreciated how I saw them making it fresh in the back. The meat seemed like it was of suspect quality but tbh at dim sum it often is. If you're nearby and have a craving, stop by! It's cheap, sweet, salty, greasy comfort food. But if you're not, it's probably not worth the trip. \n\nOh, btw -- this is a more intimidating ordering process than most so be wary of that when you go there.

Its typical of a take-out dim sum place, so it can be overwhelming with the amount of activity... with the asian women yelling at each other for something or another, and a line of people both waiting to order and at the tables, it can be difficult to know what you're ordering and if its too much food. \n\nThey have a lot of the basic offerings like buns and dumpling-like things, but since we were a group of 4, it was kind of annoying that most things came in sets of 3.

So the wait wasn't too bad. \n\nI've tried several dim sum places around here, and so far this is the best one. Their dim sums are covered with a lid so when you order to-go, the food remains hot. Other places I've been to always had no lid so whenever I eat their food its cold and gross. Also, I think it's more sanitary having a cover over it because when I see people order they are usually spitting, and I don't want people spitting in my food.\n\n[When you walk in, remember to grab their order sheet to mark how many pieces of diim sum you want and they will take your order.]\n\nWhat I love best is their shrimp dumplings. It's pretty big compared to the bay area shrimp dumplings. Also, the dim sums here are fairly cheap. They have a lot of options for you to choose, but obviously not as much if you dine-in in a restaurant. \n\nThe store is pretty small, so tables are limited.

Clement Street: where the Chinese restaurants outnumber the hole-in-the-wall bars and coffee shops 10 to 1.  Oh look, a Dim Sum place named Good Luck, we excitedly said as she checked in with Yelp to see that they had pretty good reviews.  Enter we did and that was the end of our good luck for the day.  \n\nThe place is just short of grimy and dirty. But we said what the heck and ordered this and that at their sticky counter and took the items to our table that had not been bussed.  No table had for the 40 minutes we were there, and the floor was sticky, the table was stickier yet.  People in the back of the restaurant were busy making dumplings by hand, one can see them in a dirty kitchen as you go to the restroom that has no towels and a hideous sticky commode.  The red and yellow (standard ketchup and mustard plastic squeeze bottles that were on each table) were stickier than leftover molasses.  They held the soy and pepper sauce used to drown out the dim sum or give it flavor perhaps.  \n\nYet we bit into our room temp, not hot, dim sum after dim sum.  The dough was similar to eating styrofoam we imagined, the pork inside one was a surprise shredded poor quality meat with bottled red sauce for flavor, the spring roll was very greasy and we had to wipe off the grease on their tiny napkins, the shrimp was tasteless, the veggies didn't go crunch instead wilted in your mouth... you get the picture.  \n\nThen the deserts:  anything to take the taste away from our dim sum we thought.  The egg custard mini pie was so bland and filled with something inedible, we just gagged at the fake color of yoke.  The sticky bun was like a dog toy that had been chewed by a rabid skunk, not even close to being good but was fun to roll around on the formica table top.  Value for your money?  Yes, if you are broke.    \n\nBest thing was the bottled water to wash this rancid food down.  Oh, cash only.  Duh?  You'd call your bank to get your credit card reversed for sure.  \n\nAnd that night, sorry to report, it was indeed Good Luck!

I came in toward closing so they ran out of some of my favorite things so make sure to come early. \n\nI wanted to give this place 5 starts, it was so delicious. I sat and ate and thought about how great of a review I woudl leave. Seriously super yummy and affordable dim sum. We paid under $20 for 3 people and we were stuffed. This is CASH ONLY place so don't forget to bring some $$$ :))))\n\nAlrighty now the reason why I am giving it 3 stars. I got sick after eating there and it wasn't just me. My boyfriend got sick as well hence I had to ding this place 2 stars. I don't know if my stomach could't handle the rich dumplings or it was because I came in later in the day after they had been sitting out but I wish I didn't eat so much. \n\nIf you've got an iron stomach, want delicious dim sum and don't want to pay too much this is definitely the place for you.", "author": "Dasha K."}

All the goodies are premade and kept behind the counter towards the front, you order with one of the ladies behind the counter, and pay for everything all together. \n\nThe quality wasn't bad, especially for premade food, but it's a far cry from places such as Asian Pearl in Fremont or Koi Palace in Dublin. Prices are incredibly reasonable, which makes the quality easier to stomach. I would recommend sticking with the foods that don't mind sitting around for a while, such as the porridge.\n\nPork and thousand year egg porridge:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-luck-dim-sum-san-francisco?select=YYqPK8TXJmm8qV-SMKBw7A#iXNkyJjy5B0WK7BM8ppwmw)\nThis was probably my favorite thing here, as porridge doesn't mind sitting around for a while. The porridge was flavorful and savory. The pieces of thousand year egg were well-boiled to a good texture but not overcooked so that they were soggy. The green onion and crisps on top tasted fresh and complemented the porridge well. \n\nFried stuffed taro buns:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-luck-dim-sum-san-francisco?select=YYqPK8TXJmm8qV-SMKBw7A#VbMfYIktNuBYPiFiqO-AOw)\nSince these were pre-fried and set out to sit, they were lukewarm at best when I got to them. The outside tasted of stale oil, and the inside filling was lacking. I would definitely not recommend these. \n\nPork shu mai (left), shark fin dumplings (middle), shrimp dumplings (right):\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-luck-dim-sum-san-francisco?select=YYqPK8TXJmm8qV-SMKBw7A#UBzkmaQ7Uza6ctj2PDfuaQ)\nThese steamed goodies were okay. They were at least warm from being kept in the steamer, but the shu mai and shark fin dumpling wrappers were falling apart and dry. The fillings were mediocre and not very memorable. I did appreciate the whole shrimp in the shrimp dumplings though.\n\nEgg tart:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/good-luck-dim-sum-san-francisco?select=YYqPK8TXJmm8qV-SMKBw7A#cKgHGifWAHOmlpSEs6QdJw)\nI have an unhealthy obsession with egg tarts, so I had to at least get one to try here. I'm rather glad I only got one, as it was mediocre at best. The filling was a little too gelatinous and not eggy enough for me, the outside wasn't flaky but rather doughy, and it was cold from sitting. \n\nTemperature is a huge factor for me, so I probably enjoyed my meal here less than usual. The food really wasn't bad, especially for the price point, but if I ever come back, I might bag everything to go and reheat it up at home.", "author": "Maggie X."}

But I dont think you need to really give it to them if you know what youre ordering and you speak Chinese. Their dimsum is fresh and i see that they keep them warm in a huge bamboo steamer.

Grab a paper, and circle what you want. \n\nI think their dimsum here is better than the other places i've been in SF, it's just that you don't get that cart service, nor do you get the hot sauce and the hot tea and the sit down feel. I think you should just get a bunch of food to go and eat it at a park with your friends. \n\nPeople also speak English, so for people like me who don't speak any kind of chinese besides a few words for food, it's perfect.

Good Luck is the very first place I go when I land in San Francisco and my last stop on my way out (unless of course I leave or arrive on a Tuesday). The BBQ steamed pork buns are the stuff of dreams...fluffy bun, sweet, tender juicy pork. The potstickers are huge and flavorful. I can (and have) eaten more than my fair share of those hot, chewy, savory dumplings. The pork siu mai, a porkalicious delight. Eggrolls = excellent. Dunk all of those off with a little soy sauce and hot chili sauce and I'm in heaven. The best part (well certainly one of them) is I can get enough to feed a small army (aka myself and sometimes my mom) and get change back for a $20. I ask you, where else in the Bay Area can you do that aside from the Costco food court? There are many places I'm willing to stand in line for, but Good Luck may be the only exception. If I could, I think I would eat here every day for the rest of my life. At my wedding...the pork buns and potstickers will be served (God help my future husband). At my funeral, all I ask is that people celebrate my life with dumplings. And at any and every celebration in-between - Good Luck Dim Sum will take center stage!

This is better when you're eating alone and want to sample a bunch of things. \n\nThe pork bun was exactly as expected with the fluffy bun surrounding a hot, orange substance that was very tasty and hopefully was pork. \n\nI didn't like the sesame bun since it was very chewy without much flavor. \n\nThe shrimp dumplings were just ok. I am not a fan of the smooth, white covers since they feel a little Slimey.  The shrimp was well cooked and good size. \n\nBased on another review I ordered the chicken, sausage and rice dish for $3.50. Certainly a great value since you get a whole plate of rice and meet with some bok choi. But I wouldn't recommend it. There was hardly any sausage and the chicken looked deformed to me. It wasn't chopped up into bite sized pieces. I think it was a thigh but can't be sure. Didn't taste bad, but I only ate half. \n\nThe chicken/pork dumpling was my favorite. Traditional dumpling cover with a delicious filling that had a lot of flavor. I went back for more of these. \n\nMy three stars is based on good value for your money. This is fast food dim sum.

It also helps to have friends that are like-minded, but yeah uhhhh that's something I don't have much control over.  Anyways, next best option is to just stop by one of these to-go dim sum places.\n\nThe benefit of going to a to-go place?  It's soooo cheap.  Honestly, I have no idea how they can get away with $1.70 each for most standard items.  I haven't even seen this type of low pricing in L.A!  When you can run the train on pork siu mai (two of them, they're my fav), shrimp dumplings, egg rolls, shark fin dumping, turnip cake, steamed pork dumplings, BBQ pork buns, and porridge (seriously, $2?) for $16, you just shut up, pay, and walk out the door.  It's practically highway robbery for that price!  I suppose you can get away with that kind of pricing by keeping all transactions cash-only.\n\nI suppose I should also remark on the food.  Certainly I can't claim that it's the best dim sum I've ever had in my life.  Overall though, I can't say anything underwhelmed either.  So pretty much, it doesn't suck and gets the job done!  Again, the price definitely helps.  And the porridge definitely hit the spot, especially when you need something easy for the stomach in the morning.\n\nAs expected, parking ranges from crappy to diabolical.  It's in the hub of all the Chinese food places, so it's to be expected.  Luckily my friend who dropped me off had the patience to wait for me in the line, which moved pretty fast but still took about 20 minutes on a Sunday morning.\n\nOverall, it's cheap and gets the job done.

They pack it for you in boxes but there are a couple of seats and tables if you want to eat your food while it's still warm. \n\nMy favorite was their shrimp dumplings. Their chashu pork buns was pretty good but the bun was cold and a bit dry.

I was not exactly certain about the quality of Dim Sum. My favorite spot in the city remains to be that little line out of door take out only place on Stockton with an unfortunate name, but it's my spot and I can't be unfaithful. \n\nHowever, there are advantages to this place. The price is very good. Like New York Chinatown good. It's also very efficient. I ordered our food in Chinese to impress my friend, who was, as per usual, some white dude who's not originally from California.  While the quality is at best, average, it's easy to go and order something and be out of there in no time at all, and when you order in Chinese (cantonese), they tend to become ever so slightly friendlier. Bonus for me. \n\nI quite like the idea of having a decent Dim Sum take out en route to the Presidio. This is where you may ask yourself: how many places in America can you grab some hot dim sum items like Hagao and Shumai and go for a hike in the woods? There is something utterly unreal about this scene. On one side,  it reminds one of the orient, and on the other, a bygone war-era fort turned into a park filled with newly paved trails. \n\nWhile the food is just okay, the location is superb and the variety of dim sum on the offering is pretty impressive.\n\nWe ate at the meadow in the park, away from the parents with little children having birthday parties. When did the city get infested with parents with young children? They are popping up everywhere, I bet each one of them knows how to order dim sum at a ripe age of 3. \n\nI later asked a colleague what I should have gotten besides the usual, as she's a fan of that place. She said to get the custard buns. I missed that. Perhaps we'd give it another try some day.", "author": "Victoria E."}

There are tables and chairs in the back, I'd say around 6 tables, and can seat around 15 people. Since we live so far, I didn't want to pack everything in a to-go box and then spend another 15 minutes Ubering home while the food got cold since I knew we were ordering a ton. You sort of have to stand awkwardly to the side and just wait for people to finish up, but most diners are aware this is a fast, to-go place so each table typically clears up after 10 minutes or so.\n\nYou order at the counter, and the to-go boxes cost 20 cents a piece. We ended up having to get a to-go box because there was more food than I thought. You can choose to purchase the dimsum by piece of \"by set\" which typically comes with three pieces. \n\nThe chao sao bao here is HUGE, not the typically palm-sized ones, and after eating that as our \"first course\" we were pretty stuff, and had also ordered 4 other small dishes. However, have to say that this place makes great tasting food. Even though it was a hole in the wall, didn't feel like the food was dirty (even though it was served on a tray with a paper towel and paper plates). Our entire meal between two people only cost $16 (and we shared a bottle of water). However, we didn't finish our food, and actually packed some up for the next day. \n\nIf it wasn't so far, and wasn't cash only, I'd go much more often!", "author": "Julia Z."}

Also, like others have mentioned, the customer service is not the best but don't take it personal. Be prepared to encounter a long line on weekend mornings due to its popularity. Parking can also be difficult. Seating can be hard to get and you have to be ready to snag a table as soon as you see people starting to clean up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-08-08", "description": "Good Luck Dim Sum offers one of the best to-go dim sum in the city. Lines are long, but they move at a fair, steady rate. The food is cheap. Dirt cheap. On average, three dumplings cost you less than $2, and you can get full from eating six (at least I do). Most items are loaded with carbs and protein, so you'll be satisfied quickly, but sluggish within a few hours because everything's so greasy.\n\nMy two particular favorites here are the fun kor and the sticky rice ball. Fun kor is a steamed, semi-circular pillow-shaped dumpling that's filled with ground meat. Their version has a nice, flavorful filling; however, there's not a lot of this yummy filling because the dumplings are so flat. And the skin is so thick, too. The sticky rice ball is huge (about the size of a tennis ball), and it's very substantial. The sweet glutinous rice is chewy and sticky. There's small pieces of pork and green onion dispersed throughout. The outermost sheet layer is meant to hold the ball together when steamed, and although it's edible, it's very dry.\n\nBeing able to speak Cantonese is beneficial, but not necessary. Though you're guaranteed quicker, better service if you do speak it. Good Luck.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

Specifically, it's located on Clement St. between 8th and 9th Aves.  Together with Wing Lee Bakery a couple blocks east, they have all your \"fast food\" dim sum needs covered -- good, cheap dim sum.\n\nThis is not a sit-down restaurant with carts.  Instead, you stand in line to order and your dim sum is served to you in a bag, to-go.  There are a handful of tables inside if you want to sit down and eat.  Most of the dim sum is prepared in the kitchen in the back, then wheeled out front to the ordering counter, where the food sits behind the storefront window and interior glass displays.\n\nThere's almost always a line to order.  It's first-come, first-served.  You should get your order right the first time because if you want anything else (e.g. an additional pork bun or drinks), you'll have to start back at the end of the line.  I echo other folks' sentiments about the ladies who work here.  They get impatient if you don't know what you want, so it's best to have your order ready when it's your turn.\n\nYou can get any of the following 3 dim sum items for $1.70:\n\n- Fried sesame ball\n- Deep fried stuffed dumpling\n- Egg roll\n- Deep-fried taro root\n- Flower roll\n- Crisp white sugar cake\n- Shrimp dumpling\n- Pork siu mai\n- Beef siu mai\n- Shark fin dumpling\n- Pot sticker\n- Crystal dumpling\n- Shrimp taro dumpling\n- Fun kor (shout-out to the Teochew dumpling!)\n- Turnip cake\n- Chicken siu mai\n- Chive dumpling w/ shrimp\n- Steamed pork dumpling\n- Malay cake\n- Steamed BBQ pork bun\n- Vegetable pork bun\n- Chicken bun\n\nEgg custard, rice puffs with coconut and peanuts, lotus seed buns, sausage rolls, egg yolk buns, sweet rice buns, chive dumplings, and lucky balls are available for $0.70 each.  Baked BBQ pork buns ($0.90), Chinese long donuts or krullers ($2.00), rice porridge or congee ($2.00), chicken and sausage rice ($2.70), chicken feet ($4.00/lb), and other common dim sum items are also available.\n\nUnfortunately, no cheong fun (rice noodle rolls) here.  Maybe they're too messy for the \"to-go\" format of this place.\n\nSince this restaurant is busy, the foods turn over fast and most of the dim sum is fresh.  The portion sizes are quite generous and they keep a good stock of all the items.  I recommend just about everything.  My favorites include the fried sesame balls, deep-fried taro, pork siu mai, steamed BBQ pork buns, baked BBQ pork buns, egg custard, and chicken and sausage rice.\n\nYou can consider this stuff authentic Chinese fast food.  Some of the dim sum, particularly the fried items, can be a bit greasy.  One BBQ bun (steamed or baked) or the chicken and sausage rice could easily suffice for a large snack or even a lunch.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is only open in the mornings and afternoons.  They close at 6:30pm everyday and are closed all day on Tuesdays.  Bring cash because credit cards aren't accepted.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Hop into the line, grab one of the menu sheets sitting on the counter, and mark what you want. When it's your turn, one of the ladies behind the counter will fill up a box with your order. There are a few tables in the restaurant if you want to crack open the box and eat in store, but they're pretty limited. Most people take their order to go. This is definitely a no frills kind of place, but the amazing food and the incredible value more than make up for it. Everything we got was delicious. The dumplings are also of a fairly substantial size. We managed to feed 4 people for less than $20!

I'm super impressed. \n\nI had bookmarked this place after telling my boyfriend how much I was craving dim sum. We don't ever get it to be honest, so I hesitated but he was down to get some for breakfast. Thank God. \n\nUpon arrival, you'll first notice how small the cafe is. The counter to your left houses the delicious dim sum and pastries they also offer. The line actually weaves towards the back where the tables are so prepare yourself for some slight crowding. The line itself does not take very long and even then, most people try to reserve one of the eight tables provided so they can eat right away. Cleanliness-wise, I'd say this place could use a good scrub down. It just looks like your typical Chinese bakery so that didn't bother me too much. \n\nAs you near towards the head of the line, you'll see the menu up behind the ladies working the counter because they use a red board with white letters. Some of the menus will show how many pieces are sold and how much they go for, while others will provide individual costs per piece depending on the size I'm assuming. The women behind the counter are pretty straight forward, I did feel a little rushed because I didn't know what I wanted exactly. Good thing I checked this page and the reviews though because I was satisfied with my order. My boyfriend got us the shrimp shu mai, pork shu mai, and potstickers. One order for three pieces? Yes please! I myself ordered the egg yolk bun, a steamed bbq pork bun, and a little custard tart. \n\nThis place is bomb digs and I highly recommend to anyone in the area looking for cheap, yet delicious, pick-up food.", "author": "Tricia M."}

Good Luck Dim Sum has all the characteristics of a good chinese restaurant - It's located in an isolated part of the city where the only surrounding businesses are other chinese/asian local businesses, and the customer service is NONEXISTENT, and let me tell you why...\n\nSo each table has a bottle of garlic chili sauce and a soy sauce...well my table was missing the soy sauce and I couldn't find any available soy sauce around. I approached one of the workers and asked for a soy sauce in which she replied, \"there's one on your table\"...I persistently told her that we did not have one so she gave up and decided to check for herself. When she realized she was wrong, she got frustrated and decided to steal the soy sauce from another table that was using it..you can always count on truly asian business to have poor customer service. \n\nAnyways.. on to the food..it was DELICIOUS and the best part was that it was CHEAP. It's always a nice surprise when you pay little for your food and you get something delicious out of it.

She might stiff you on the items you pay for or give you a broken item. \n\nEach time the younger lady serves me, I always get the number of items that I paid for.\n\nThe shrimp dumplings are particularly good here.  I used to like the taro shrimp dumplings but they add too much salt now.\n\nI was surprised how good the fun gor is.  It's like a giant pork soup dumpling.  It's full of porky sauce inside with bits of Chinese celery.  It's really delicious.\n\nMy husband likes their lucky balls, he says it's like a Chinese donut.  It's full of red bean paste.  We also like their fried dumplings filled with pork, it's extra crunchy here.   The chicken sticky rice inside lotus leaves aren't as good as they used to be, too salty.\n\nCash only.", "author": "Lorissa W."}

The business is small and the communication is limited so here's what to do: on your way in, pick up the pink sheet of paper on the right side of the display counter. While standing in line, circle the items you want- the top section gives you 3 pieces for each order. For example, get the Chive Dumpling with Shrimp. If you want 6 pieces, circle the name and write \"2\" next to it to show you are ordering two orders of three pieces each. I would also go with the Sweet Rice Chicken Wrapped in Lotus Leaves. My Cantonese friend also told me that his litmus test for good dim sum is eating the Deep Fried Stuffed Dumpling. Good Luck Dim Sum passed. You should also order at least two orders of the \"Shrimp Dumpling.\"\nDon't upset the ladies and give them your credit card. Bring cash! If you're ordering for 3 people, you should have at least $25 on you. Good Luck Dim Sum is pretty much my go-to dim sum place and it's delicious!", "author": "Grace L."}

Steam from the food fogging up the display window, rice cakes and buns stacked against the glass case, and elderly Asian gents sitting in the back reading Chinese newspapers. \n\nWe ordered har gow, turnip cakes, chicken feet, egg tarts, custard buns and a bowl of rice with pork and greens. The har gow was very large, with thick dough. A little different from the kind I loved in Hong Kong. To me, a good shrimp dumpling has paper thin, translucent dough - thin enough to give the shrimp filling center stage, but chewy and starchy enough to complement its meaty saltiness and hold it together. These har gow are different, but standard for SF Chinatown. The turnip cakes are a little blander than my grandpa used to make them, and not very hot - maybe could have used longer on the skillet. The custard buns are of a different variety than the traditional Canto buns. The ones I am used to have fillings made of preserved egg yolk and condensed milk. When you bite into them, they ooze a molten gold that tastes both sweet and a little salty. These had more of a sweet and crumbly texture, but were still a treat. The egg tarts were the saving grace of this place. They had a wonderful flaky crust, and deep cups filled to the brim with egg custard. And the custard itself was fantastic. Just soft enough so that it didn't fall apart when we bit into them, and with no cracks on the surface, so they didn't look overcooked.", "author": "Elaine T."}

As a result, I tend to be pretty skeptical of takeout dim sum places, but this place is one of the exceptions I'll make. \n\nI've come here a handful of times over the years. They have most of the common items you'll find in a dim sum restaurant, and everything is made to take out. They do have a dining area inside with a few tables though, and they can give you a tray to take your food over and eat there.\n\nGenerally one of the problems with takeout places is that the food sits out at the counter forever so things aren't fresh. But since this place has high demand, food gets ordered and replaced fairly regularly. Unlike other takeout dim sum I've had, this place always had food that you could tell was just freshly made.\n\nYou can order from a sheet of paper, or if you're Cantonese you can just tell them what you want. I find that they're faster if you speak to them in Cantonese because then they don't have to check against a paper to make sure they got everything.\n\nTheir porridge is pretty good here. They don't give a description in English but it's porridge with pork and preserved eggs. If you choose to dine in, all the stuff they give you is disposable so you'll get a tall container with a short plastic spoon.

Like I said, we like to divide our takeout preferences between two places in the same area but this place is great for their haw gow and siu mai (beef, chicken, and pork).  We've also ordered the egg rolls (chuen cuen), custards (don tot), fried sesame balls (jean dui), turnip cake (low bok go), deep fried shrimp dumpling (hom sui gok), and a bunch of other stuff that is deep fried, pan fried, baked etc... so technically, I didn't really mean that only the steamed stuff is good...\n\nThe dim sum is pretty sizable, not wimpy, and the prices are very reasonable (cheap) so naturally you should expect a line.  One cool thing about the pricing is that you get stuff individually or by the order...\n\nFor example, say I order from the 3 for $1.60 group (e.g. haw gow, siu mai, etc..), I can have 3 haw gow for that price, or I can have 1 haw gow, 1 beef sui mai, 1 pork sui mai for that price.  You can mix and match in any combination.  There is an order form with pricing on top of the counter for you to use...\n\nThough they can understand and speak English, I've found that it never hurts to speak to them in Chinese, even if it's \"village\" or \"Ching-lish\"...\n\nRandomly, I tried to order something that my bro-in-law likes but that I've never ordered.  It's called a Malay cake (ma lay gow), and all this time, I though it was a monkey cake (inside joke...)  I tried to order it Xmas morning but I was told by the lady behind the counter that they didn't have any...\n\n\"That's ok, I'll wait for it...\"\n\n\"Then you're going to wait a long time, because we didn't make any today...\"\n\nOh well...\n\nI've only been here before noon and always for takeout so I can't vouch for anything else...", "author": "Lawrence L."}

Best of all, everything can be had for a dollar or two.\n\nThe Bad: This place is so authentic, they don't even have water on tap! I would have liked a wider drink selection.

I particularly like their baked and steamed pork buns, which, frankly, are under-priced for their quality. This place is much better quality food than the other dim sum bakery type shops on the same street or in the area. The best things to order are the food that are still in steamers because they're hot, though they will warm up baked buns for you as well.\n\nThe best thing to do here is to get a box to go because there isn't a lot of seating and the tables there are are cramped. \nThe only other negatives are that sometimes they do sell out of various items, and the line is often quite long.", "author": "Allxie C."}

Yes they're rude, but if you're not a regular they don't really give a damn because you're slowing them down 15 people and you're buying like 5 bucks worth of stuff.

I also did not like the chunks of garlic inside with the shrimp.\n\nThe porridge was actually pretty decent and they give you a huge amount ($2).

Each order equals 3 pieces. \n\nDo NOT expect:\nA spot to dine in and socialize. Very limited space with very limited seating. One table that seemed to originally serve as a spot to sit was drowning in to-go boxes. This place is definitely designed for pick-up orders. Its quite crowded so you'll likely find yourself wanting to exit anyways.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-02", "description": "Sometime yesterday I toyed around with the thought of doing a food crawl along Clement Street. A sample of something delicious here, then move on to the next stop, for one bite, and then a few blocks down to another. There was no set agenda and no list...total spur of the moment.\n\nIt's quite apparent that one of the more popular quick and cheap options along this area best suited for food crawls, are the several storefronts that specialize in dim sum takeout (dubbed \"Dim Sum Bakeries\") with random bakeries selling sweet and savory buns next. You don't even see these kinds of dim sum bakery deli shops in Hong Kong (but they do have el cheapo efficient cooked to order sit down neighborhood eateries that achieve a similar purpose of downscaling it for local folks which are better). And it becomes quite apparent after observing the competitors and Good Luck Dim Sum appears to be the winner. It's not just by the crowds, but also the efficiency, quality, quantity, variety. It's a lottery winning combination, particularly with the target demographic consisting mostly of locals who are Chinese expats from Southern China and some from Hong Kong. It is almost like to them having their egoe$ Swedish massaged with hot stones by a professional from Thailand while offering a Mainland Chinese reflexology foot rub with a pot of lavender tea (tips included).\n\nAnd places like these are also great if you don't want to be arsed waiting hours in line (particularly during Labor Day Weekend) for yum cha at your favorite dim sum joint, rubbing elbow to elbow with even more aggressive FOBs and granny types willing to run your ass over just to get a numbered ticket. Thus the next best thing is just to pick up some takeout/reheat at home, or if you are visiting the area like me, have them fill up a paper plate, then take it to the dining area and wolf it down like goats getting pellets at a petting zoo.\n\nIt all happened so fast...took a check sheet and circled my wish list (I had one entirely In Chinese) then handed it to the employee. Less than a minute later, the plate was packed with goodies, and came to an even $6. $hit, I spend $20 to $30 on yum cha easy (not to mention $1 per person for a pot of tea). No tea here (bring your own, or if you are desperate, there are craptacular boba shops in the area).\n\nHa gow, pork siu mai, dried shrimp cheung fun (a huge monster at that, only $0.70!!!), pan fried daikon cake. I was supposed to \"sample\" right? :-o\n\nThe table spaces fill up quickly, but don't hesistate to ask if someone already seated at the table if there are empty chairs available. \n\nSure, this stuff is not even comparable to a sit down restaurant, but the steamed items are generally still quite hot (the deep fried stuff may be nearing room temperature like the daikon cake). At this rate, don't take the time to nibble and savor....it's PAC MAN time to gobble the stuff up if dining in.\n\nTo assist with this, use the \"ketchup\" and \"mustard\" squirt bottles at the tables. The ketchup bottle (red) is the soy sauce, and probably a tad sweetened. The \"mustard\" bottle is the chili sauce, and I highly recommend you use it, which will elevate the daikon cake and cheung fun to heights you never realized. Heck you are not at Hong Kong Lounge or Koi Palace, so SQUIRT dat chit all over with reckless abandon and let your inner beast run wild. I love my ha gows, but I love GLDS ha gows with chili sauce too! \n\nConclusion? Blows away the 99 Ranch supermarkets that offer dim sum (in the Peninsula or South Bay) and even Dim Sum King in Sunnyvale. Probably pretty close to Mongkok Dim Sum on Noriega.", "author": "Ken K."}

Its not that they don't taste good, its more like the experience growing up - spending the entire Sunday afternoon with my parents waiting forever for a table, then again waiting forever for the right dim sum lady to pass by, and if she's out, my weekend will pretty much be ruined and very much wasted. And the fact that I grew up in Hong Kong (where dim sum really originated from) and Sacramento Chinese food is very mediocre does not help with my dislike against dim sum.  I honestly haven't been to a dim sum place since I was like 16, until yesterday, when I randomly walked in Good Luck Dim Sum with my grandpa. \n1st thought to self: Holy crap! There's a long line! It must be good! \n2nd thought: Holy crap! Its only $1.60 for 3 pieces! \n3rd thought : Really? Holy crap its only $1.60 for 3 pieces!!\n\nThere must have been at least 8 people in line, but there were 4 Chinese ladies working behind the counter, so the line moved really quickly. While you're in line, you can grab a sheet menu which has all the items they offer and you can circle whatever you want. If this is gonna be your first time here, I highly suggest ordering a piece of almost everything, grabbing an extra menu, and put stars next to what you liked best for when you come back, because you'll definitely want to. One thing I really like about the idea of to-go dim sum is that I don't have to wait for a table, and I can order just 1 piece of something, whereas at restaurants you would have to get a basket of 3 or 4 pieces.\n\nWe bought over $30 worth of stuff, of which, I particularly liked the BBQ pork bun, flower roll (steamed plain bun shaped like a big knot), and mochi (what they call the sweet rice puff with coconut and peanut).  My grandpa said he would come back, and that says a lot since he is very picky when it comes to Chinese food. Btw, not everything is 3 for $1.60. Custard tart, egg yolk bun, mocha, lotus seed bun, etc etc are 65 cents each, and certain other items are $2.00 each or sold by the pound.\nP.S. paper boxes are 20 cents extra! Otherwise they put everything in plastic bags. If you love trees and don't want your food mixed and meshed, bring containers!", "author": "Katie S."}

So I'm quite spoiled with the amazing restaurant ambiance with 5 stars service. \n\nBut let me tell ya, this hole-in-the-wall place really hits the spot for me! It's a quick fix for your dim sum cravings. Don't expect good service, spotless tables, waiter changes your plate kind of service! You ain't gonna get it here, fo sho!

Prices are $1.70 for the 3-for items, with $0.70 and $1.00 single-items available.\n\nScrew sitting inside, just walk north a few blocks to Presidio Park and eat your lunch on the damned ground!  Halfway in-between there and GG Park, it's a great little spot and a great little Richmond sub-hood (I've heard people call it Little China Town....is that a thing?).\n\nAnyways, it's very easy to get in, get some good dim sum and get out.  No long lines/wait or dining rooms crammed full of families and screaming, dirty children, or waiting on carts with limited selection of lukewarm traveling food sloughing about.  This place is 100x better than most of the sit-down spots that appear more \"quality.\"\n\nGOOD LUCK!", "author": "Sam R."}

As many as 73 million sharks a year are killed for their fins and, I'm sorry but I can't, in good conscience, recommend a place that serves up shark fin dumplings.  Its an unsustainable food source and, I think, very irresponsible of restaurants to still be serving it.

I'm so thankful for my friend who  lives in SF to introduce us to this place...love it.\n\nLiving in Houston, I'm used to good and cheap Chinese food. But man, there's nothing like Good Luck here in Houston. There needs to be though.\n\nHOW IT WORKS:\n\nYou line up and order what you what on a sheet of paper. The line is usually pretty long (so I've heard), but we went on a Sunday morning at like 9am, and there was really no line. Guess people are too lazy to wake up that early on the weekend, eh? You then hand your piece of paper to one of the workers there, and she'll get your order for you. You get it right there and then before they serve the next person. You then pay at the counter, and have the option to either eat in the restaurant or take it to go. Most people took their order to go, but there were about 6 tables there (4 chairs each) for customers to sit and enjoy their food. \nCon: No waiter/waitress. Pro: No tip! \n\n\nPRICES ($$CASH ONLY$$):\n\nEverything is SO cheap. Most of the items are 3 pieces for $1.50, and some individual items are like 60-75 cents each, and the most expensive item is $2 each (but huge portion!). Milk tea was only $1! I went with my friend, and the two of us ordered a total of $15 worth of items, and we DEFINITELY over-ordered. My friend was a big guy too...and tends to have a big appetite (loves Cici's Pizza and all sorts of buffets). We still couldn't finish everything after stuffing our faces. \n\nFOOD:\n\nThe food was pretty delicious. I wouldn't call it the best tasting, but it was about average. (Houston spoils me).

Also, you just order at the counter as this is not a dim sum place where little carts go around. I had the pork buns (which were too sweet and too bready) and yummy potstickers. I would recommend getting food to go here, because dining in was not very appetizing for me. Twice big disgustingly dirty garbage cans (the kind that go out on the street) were wheeled through the restaurant right by my table. Having to smell stinky garbage and looking at dirty and sticky garbage cans while eating was so disgusting I had to take my food to go to try to eat later on.", "author": "Natalia K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-28", "description": "I was at Good Luck Dim Sum on a Saturday. There were five ladies working at the counter; I was about the 10th customer in line for take-outs.  I finally made it to the front after 30 minutes and the server took another 5+ minutes just to fill my order of about 8 items....not acceptable!  The servers were more focused on conversing with each other than attending to their customers.\n\nThe beef meat ball, taro cake, coconut mochie and shrimp dumplings were good.  The ratio of meat to bread on the baked pork bun was disproportionate, rendering the dough tasteless.  The tamale was decent in size, but it lacked filling and flavor.  They sold out of spareribs with black bean sauce over rice (sold out at noon??), so I tried their chicken/sausage over rice.  That too, lacked flavor; the rice was undercooked, and the chicken was too well done and dry.\n\nI've had good and less-than-desirable dim sum throughout the Bay Area; this place is just mediocre.   I expect this type of quality in the suburbs, but not in the \"new Chinatown\" district of SF.  For take-outs, a better option is TC Pastry. You can literally drive to TC Pastry in the Sunset, pick up your order, come back to Good Luck Dim Sum and you'll still see the same people in line (no exaggeration).  The prices are comparable, but the quality, service and queue are far better at TC Pastry for a casual dim sum take-out establishment.\n\nPros:  Good variation of dim sum selection.  Price is very reasonable.   They do have several tables if you choose to dine in.\nCons:  Lack courtesy and speed in service.  Several of the items lacked flavor.  Parking can be a challenge depending on time of day; be sure to have at least 45 minutes on the meter during peak time!\n\nSince there is no two-and-a-half stars rating, I am giving it an overall 3 stars for the \"ok\" quality food and substandard service.", "author": "Jean T."}

We made it out of there with 2 orders of har gao, 1 order of pork siu mai, 1 order of chicken siu mai--which, by the way, is the lighter and less fatty version of the pork and the one I prefer--1 order of steamed bbq pork bun and 2 orders of pan fried shrimp and pork chives for $11.  That feeds 3 hungry peeps on a recession era budget.\n\n2)  The line was about 15 people deep when we got there.  Processing time was 1 minute per person.  I timed them because our driver posting illegally on Clement (which is the only way to do it) told me he waited exactly that amount of time when I got back to the car.  \n\n3)  Those Chinese ladies behind the counter are fast and more efficient than ants in a colony.  The person in front of us tried to ask for a pen so she can give them her order on that pink menu sheet and she was told, \"No!  Just tell me.  I remember!\"  And Chinese lady did remember.  My turn came next and like a pro, I rattled off one order after another and she boxed it all up in about a minute.  She repeated my order to me in such lightning fast fashion, I didn't really understand her.  But I trusted her efficiency more than my own memory so I just agreed and gratefully accepted my precious pink box.\n\n4)  Best dim sum I've had in a long time.  Tip: order the custard early, they ran out mid-afternoon today and go for the steamed shrimp and chive dumplings as they tend to be less greasy than their pan-fried cousins.", "author": "Joc V."}

It's less than half the price of a sit down dim sum restaurant. I LOVE dim sum, and when it's cheap, that's even better!! It's a hole in the wall place, small with a few tables and meant to be more of a take out place than a sit down dim sum place. There are some tables available. The dim sum here is not the best, but for the price, it's definitely worth it!! Don't get me wrong, this place is good and deserves a 4 star rating. Most are 3 pieces for $1.70, or 70 cents a piece for some other to 90 cent bbq meat buns (mmmm, meat buns!). My family and I got too excited and ordered waaaay more food than we could eat. I should had listened to another reviewer when they said the chicken feet was not good-- because it was NOT good. It was way to chewy and just didn't taste good. I like chicken feet and I could barely finish one. My mom tried to finish it to not let food go to waste but even she gave up. Everything else we ordered was good. We had haw gow, shau mai, BBQ meat buns, egg tarts, and some others that I can't think of the name. It was all good except for the chicken feet!

It's been a while since I ate dim sum.  I took a hiatus, like 3 years.  During that time, I gained and lost 38 lbs.  I ate all manners of dumpling, hamburger, yogurt, food.  I didn't learn anything, yet here I am.  4 years older, not a bit wiser, and much more bitter.\n\nI started dim sum again early October 2011.  After realizing that my BF was never going to be a morning person, never accompany me to breakfast during the AM hours, and I am likely to starve waiting for him, I resolved to eat breakfast by myself.  In the manner I am accustomed: hastily, rapidly, a bit embarrassed, loudly, alone, while grunting out my pleasure.  It could describe any number of activities.  This morning, I'm describing breakfast.\n\nA few weeks ago, I reintroduced Good Luck Dim Sum to my mouth.  I stood in line for over 20 minutes, pink order slip clutched in my hot little hands, and bought only 3 pieces of dim sum.  That's about 1 piece every 7 minutes.  It took me less time to snarf it down.  The lady behind the counter looked at me funny.  Since it was 7:30 am, I looked funny right back, albeit ignorantly-funny.  \n\nGood Luck is much tastier in so many ways to the other dim sum places.  But it has its drawbacks.  \n\n1. Their bao, gar, buns, jook, etc is made with much higher quality ingredients, more love and attention.  The rice wrappers on the steamed gar are never soggy, the fillings are dainty and well proportioned.  The meat is well seasoned and flavorful.  But, everything is smaller.  Slightly smaller sized gar, slightly smaller sized bun, slightly smaller everything.  But dainty.\n\n2.  They have a high turn over of food.  People don't just buy 3 pieces (as I did), they buy 3 buckets.  On early Sunday/Saturday mornings, orders keep coming out of the kitchen for banquet sized foil trays of dumplings, egg custards, bao and steamed goodness.  Your piece of dim sum is probably not much older than 20 minutes.  BUT this means you have to wait about 20 minutes in line since they fill so many phone orders of banquet quantity.  I'm talking church-group sized quantities.  \n\n3.  Efficient ordering system.  The pink paper.  It cuts down on the pointing and gesturing.  Although some people still insist on human interaction.  Maybe this person lives in isolation and has no friends, therefore they talk to as many service industry people as they can when let out of their cage.  I've heard of people who really look forward to telemarketers to call so they can have a conversation with a human voice.\n\n4.  I can't quit this place.  I will get out of bed at 7 am on a rainy, cold saturday morning and drive my hairy butt to Clement street just to get some of the fried stuffed dumplings.  FRIED STUFFED DUMPLINGS!  If ever perfection has been put in my mouth, it would be this.  It is a savory meat filling wrapped in a slightly sweet mochi wrapper, and then DEEP FRIED.  My brain just exploded from happiness.  Sweet.  And Savory.  And fried.  In a dumpling!  If I ever lie about staying late at work, or going in early to work, it'll be because I'm sneaking a tete-a-tete with this fried stuffed dumpling.  It's a homewrecker.  In hooker heels.\n\nJook is ok.  Very flavorful and the best out of all 3 dim sum places that I've tried.  But.  \"Mom's is still the best.\"  Snarf!  This is a close 2nd.  Let's just wait and see if the MSG coma hits hard and fast, I need a short nap before brunch with the kids and the parents.\n\nUPDATE: my mouth.  Is a dry desert.  Of parched MSG-dessicated dryness.

Stumbling upon the gem that is Clement Street, my trusty Yelp app led me to Good Luck.\n\nI don't know if I came on a good day, or maybe it was just the natural high of being in my favorite city in the world, but I suppose it just depends on (1) the ladies' moods that day, and (2) your overall approach to the situation.  I filled out my paper, asked brief questions, and ordered a sh*t ton.  No wonder they loved me.  I took my large order to go, so I didn't have to cage fight for one of three tables.\n\nBaked pork buns:  the meat is a bit more minced than I'd like, but the taste is absolutely spot on.  Sweet, salty, bbq porky, and generous meat-to-dough ratio.  Same with the steamed buns.\n\nPork siomai:  soooo good.  Siomai connoisseurs take note -- here the wrapper is perfectly adhered to a nicely seasoned filling.\n\nShrimp har gow:  see above.  I was lucky to get it fresh :)\n\nSesame ball with mung bean:  umm we call this buchi?  Anyway here at GLDS it's perfectly toasty on the outside and not too sweet on the inside.  I typically don't eat buchi but it was incredible.\n\nSteamed sponge cake:  ehh, typical.  Not bad though.\n\nGet your pink paper, grab a hot-commodity pen, mark your whatnot, ask questions quickly, and pay a very small amount for a very large amount, if you know what I'm saying.

So, if you plan on eating there, make sure someone saves a table.

The conventional inclination about these places is one with people overcrowding the counter with a semi-dingy ambiance where the lighting is not always the best.

If you tried one Dim Sum to go, they're almost all the same.  \n\nSo why the 2 stars?  I was driving by Clements street and wanted to get some Dim Sum take out.  Just for myself.  I walked in there and asked to order.  The lady who picks the food for me grabs a cardboard tray to put Dim Sum on.  I told her \"no, it's for take out\".  Then she puts the cardboard tray away and get a plastic to go box.  It's a individual 'clamshell' plastic box to hold food.  About 5inch x 4inch x 5inch.  Not too big, just an individual take out box.  I though to myself, okay, I'll order enough to fill the box and it'll be a good lunch.  I order this and that until it was fill.  She covered it up and said the total cost was $8.70.  I thought to myself, that's kind of expensive for a box that small.  I looked up at the pricing and it says $1.70 for items of three.  Since I ordered 5 different items of three, that should be a total of $8.50.  Where does the 20 cent come in???  Apparently, that extra 20 cent was to that clam-shell box.  After you open them and eat, the plastic shell just falls apart to become two plastic bowls.  No worth 20 cents at all.  I understand the states require stores/restaurant to charge 10 cent to bags, but why is this place charging me 20 cents for a cheap container???  If I didn't want to pay the 20 cents, how are they going to pack it up and let me take it out??? \n\nNow, to add insult to injury, that little box of food costs me $8.70.  That's 15 pieces of Dim Sum in one little clam-shell box, with room to spare.  That's when I realize what their doing.  They're making all these Dim Sum smaller than other places.  Yes, the price per three pieces is lower at $1.70.  However, they're much more smaller.  I wasn't too happy and went to another Dim Sum place how a few blocks and spent another $7.00 on Dim Sum.  Just your regular meat dim sum, not the BBQ pork bun or anything larger.  And that filled up a MUCH larger plastic box around 10inch x 4 inch x 10inch.  And they didn't charge me a container fee.\n\nYes, Good Luck Dim Sum is cheaper in price, BUT, it's smaller.  They're making food by nickeling and diming.  So in the end, you're paying more money, for less weight in good.\n\nThis forum is about food as well as the price you pay for the food, quality, and so forth.  The rating I gave them is in comparison with other restaurants.  If you eat a lot of Dim Sum, you'll know the average size of each piece.  Good Luck Dim Sim's pieces are actually quite smaller than your average restaurants that serves Dim Sim.  Yes, they cost less compared to other restaurants.  But not by much.  They make up the cost by giving you less food.  That was my rating.  \n\nThe twenty cent container was a unexpected surprise cost.  If you've been there, there's not a lot of tables and seats for customers to eat in.  So the majority of the customers are taking the food out.  But they do not disclose that they charge twenty cent for a disposal container.  This is another way they are nickle and dime-ing customers.  They should just factor that cost into the pricing of food.  But they don't.  If they did factor the cost of the container on the food, the pricing will push their sales over the edge as too expensive for the amount of food paid.", "author": "Jack L."}

Yes, I've only been here once and yes, we kinda scarfed down our lunch, but I'm pretty sure I'm going to want to come back here every time I visit SF. Good Luck Dim Sum is located in New Chinatown, which I didn't even know exist, and that's why you get a local friend to take you there. It's definitely not a touristy spot, and I hope it stays that way (even though, by virtue of me writing a Yelp! review, I'm condoning more gringo tourists to find it). There are maybe 5, 6 small tables, each sitting four comfortably, so most people get their dim sum to go in styrofoam boxes. Dine-in's no fancier: you get your dim sum piled onto paper plates, eaten with cheap chopsticks or plastic forks. Hey, if that means I get to eat a buttload of delicious dim sum for less than $8 a person, I'm willing to eat off the plastic tray for all I care. And that's why I love this place: It's cheap, it's fast, and it's good. Did I mention it's cheap? Seriously, I'm from San Gabriel, where dim sum is dime a dozen (figuratively speaking), but I've never seen three people fed fully on less than $25, as what happened at Good Luck. The best thing is, the dim sum were actually very good. I can't even remember all the different dim sum we ordered. Here's a partial list: \nHar Gow (shrimp dumpling)\nBeef Siu Mai\nShrimp Taro dumpling - this one was suuuuper taro-y (ie. gummy)\nChicken and sausage rice - something new for me, and absolutely delicious\nChinese Chive Dumpling\nFried Sesame Ball\nCustard - a must for me every time, and they do it hear perfectly; glistening yolky goodness\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum is a truly blissful dim sum experience, and a must try even if you're just in SF for a stopover. Don't tell everyone, though; I don't wanna wait in line too long for my next dim sum fix.", "author": "Mariel L."}

Portions are really big.. 3 of us overestimated and ordered way too much and ended up taking a lot of it home.  My only gripe is, even though we ate there, the food wasn't very hot.  We walked around this area and saw a few of the take out dim sum's, Good Luck had the biggest variety as well as the big crowd. Don't be turned off by the long line.. it moves quick.

But great take out dim sum is hard to find and this place is definitely worth the wait.  O.K. probably not the 45 minutes wait on a Saturday afternoon which is aptly named \"Good Luck\" getting your order in a hurry.\n\nThe same three Chinese ladies seem to work behind the counter every day taking your order.  They're a bit curt if you don't know how to order (a la The Soup Nazi) and if you start to ask too many questions about the food items.  For the most part, they work at a good even pace to move the line along fairly quickly.  Pink menus are provided for you to circle your dim sum purchases to make large orders easy to fill.\n\nGenerally, one order of dim sum are three pieces (better group price than individual orders.)  So make sure you say \"One Order\" for three pieces or \"One Piece\" if you prefer a more limited experience.\n\nBest take out jook (rice porridge)  I've ever had, although \"The Slanted Door\" at the Ferry Building makes a darn good jook too.  This place serves (optional) it with green onions and that crunchy fried stuff that other places do not offer.  The jook consistency is always smooth and creamy, not lumpy and watery like some other inferior versions.\n\nLove the shrimp dumpling and the shrimp/scallion dumpling.  This dumpling is fairly large (2\" diameter) and is lightly panned fried on the top and bottom to give it that crunchiness.  My favorite!   \n\nThe chicken bun is also my favorite along with the rice ball dim sum they sell.  Great alternative to the pork buns and they're easy to eat on the run.\n\nFor more of a hefty rice filled meal try the rice wrapped in lotus leaf (a dim sum staple) or the chicken & vegetable over rice.  Everything's reasonably priced and that's why I love living in San Francisco.", "author": "Doug I."}

They have little juice boxes of lychee juice, mango juice or chrysanthemum tea (my personal fav from childhood) for $1 or so to help wash down your grub.  Basically, my boyfriend and I got freakin' stuffed for less than $14.\n\nYou can take out, or eat in.  All the tables are accessorized with soy sauce and chunky hot sauce, the usual dim sum accompaniments.\n\nPersonal picks: shrimp dumplings, chive dumplings, Malaysian cake, steamed BBQ pork buns (really carmel-ly :D)  \n\nWhy no 5 stars? Because their custard buns are a tid bit tough...", "author": "Sherry C."}

This is primarily a take-out place with long lines/waits. \n\nGod forbid you touch one of their pink boxes! So, my friends and I ordered way too much food and we had to take it to go. Yes, we ordered 4 boxes too much. So, we grabbed 4 boxes without asking the dim sum ladies. After that all hell broke loose. THREE ladies, independently, came up to us to yell at us about the boxes. They EACH opened up every single box to make sure there was a lot of food inside the boxes. Apparently, we are supposed to ask them first before taking the boxes, because, otherwise we would have to pay for them. My friends and I hypothesized that they were being so cheap because old asian ladies come to take pink boxes all the time - do we look like old asian ladies?? \n\nIn any case, here's the drill : Get a pink piece of paper and pen from the counter. The 3 for $1.60 means that you can get 3 pieces of X dim sum for $1.60. The top three chinese characters with $1.00 next to them means: coffee, tea, and soda. The dim sum is huge. Each dumpling is twice the normal dumpling. I didn't expect that. However, they were all lukewarm, a little soggy, and tasted pretty much all the same. The oily bread was really, really hard.

So from what I can recall...Like a cheap Asian, I could practically sniff out the epicness of this place while staring at a list of Dim Sum reviews on Yelp early Sunday afternoon.\n\nThis place has a solid rating for a reason. It's not gourmet by any means, and the format for ordering food is rather confusing if you have no idea what you're doing. Luckily, the ladies behind the counter have a working knowledge of English and they'll bark out their demands while you puzzle over the list of dim sum they offer. \n\nIt's a really tiny hole in the wall joint and there isn't a lot of space for seating inside. Most people here seem to order to go, which seems like a good choice if you live nearby. Either way, you grab a little pink sheet of paper with their menu and find a golf pencil. You circle what you want and indicate the quantity somewhere off to the side if you want more than one order. It can be a bit confusing if you don't know your dim sum, so beware! After you make your choices, you show your paper to the Chinese lady behind the counter and she'll grab a pink box and shove your food up in the hizzay. So if you eat in, or take out, it all goes in the same packaging. \n\nThe food very much reflects the people in the place. Hardcore. The three of us ordered about everything on the menu, and the lady was able to calculate it all by hand. Jeez...that's reinforcing a stereotype right there. Their buns and dumplings were very solid. As in greasy, filling, and quite tasty. No delicate little flowers here...\n\nI was pretty happy with most of the food here, however I was a bit disappointed in the chicken feet and their pork spareribs in black bean sauce. The chicken feet seemed to be cooked all mushy and the flavor was a bit off. Both the chicken feet and pork spareribs had these weird bone splinters. Like they had bought discounted chicken's feet...the ones that were broken from the genetically retarded chickens from KFC or something. \n\nI'd probably give this place more of a 3.5 stars...their cooler drinks were a bit expensive for what they were. Asian juice boxes should not be a dollar each! However the overall price of this place is pretty freakin' cheap. It makes me feel very happy deep inside. Meow. \n\nAlso...if you're a vegetarian...I'd watch out how the food is prepared. As I was enjoying my dim sum and commenting on how heavy the food felt, my eyes rested upon a stack of boxes in the corridor to the kitchen. It took a while for me to comprehend in my food-coma-induced-haze...but there it was...LARD. \n\nDelicious.", "author": "Grace Y."}

Men kept coming out of the kitchen with carts of hot, steaming batches of deliciousness to replenish (or so I thought). \n\nWhen it was my turn, I gave the surly woman behind the counter my pink form with circled requests. I said \"for here.\" I actually just wanted to have a few pieces there, dipped in chili sauce scrumptiousness, a bit of tea, then take the rest with me. So I asked her for a box. \"NO BOX FOR YOU!\" she yelled and furiously shook her head. I started laughing, but realized she was serious. (Fyi: You do have to pay extra for the to go pink boxes and I was willing to do so.) \n\nNot sure if my request really pissed her off, but in a wild frenzy she totally piled all the dim sum onto a single plate. This created a dim sum MOUNTAIN. She had also added six pieces I did not ask for. Shumai was rolling down onto the counter. It was completely ridiculous. The man behind me quietly told me to take a few plastic bags with me. Counter lady then shouted, \"HOW MANY FORKS? I laughed and said, \"Ummm, just one!\" Then she screamed, \"YOU EAT FIRST, THEN COME BACK!\"  I wanted to run away but decided I was too hungry to leave. \n\nI went to go make myself some milky Lipton tea--they were out of cream. I sat at a dirty, grease covered table and all the chili sauce containers had been scraped clean. Btw, in order to even begin eating, I had to pack up some of the dim sum into the plastic bags and store it away in my purse like a hobo squirrel! Final note; everything I consumed was cold, chewy (in a bad way) and super slimey greasy. So sad! Shrimp har gow, pork shumai, barbeque pork bun, pork pot sticker.

They don't have the fried Chinese donut that goes so well with congee, but the won ton strips are a nice substitute and included in the price.  I like to pick out one or two orders of dim sum to go with the congee.  \n\nThe har gow (shrimp dumplings) are good though pasty.  I was annoyed that some of the skins were already broken.  All their dumplings are pretty solid, such as the crystal dumplings and shark fin dumplings ($1.20 - $1.30 for three) though not out of this world, five star worthy good.\n\nThe steamed chicken and Chinese sausage and rice dish ($2.20) makes a satisfying and cheap lunch.  I've tried to make this at home and it doesn't turn out as good as theirs (and neither does my congee).  They also sell cheap steamed and baked buns.

However, the shrimp crepes were quite mediocre with very little shrimp. As for the sweets, the lotus bun tasted good but the bun was hard and cold. On the other hand the fried sesame balls were actually on the warmer side and not overly oily. The egg custards were also nicely flavored but again they were cold.

I just got a pan-fried chive dumpling, 2 shrimp dumplings, a steamed BBQ pork bun, a stick rice ball, and a minced meat dumpling (fun gou).\n\nThe chive dumpling has the best crisp of any place that makes it. The filling was pretty average and good tasting. The shrimp dumplings were a little smaller than I am familiar with at sit-down yum cha restaurants but for the value you are paying, this is acceptable. The shrimp is pretty fresh. I haven't had the sticky rice ball in possibly over a year, I couldn't even remember what it is called in Canto. The ball is a little worse than the last time I had it since the rice quality is a bit worse but the size is still the same thankfully. I love the minced meat dumpling here. This time, I thought there was less filling than usual since the taste of the wrap/skin overtook the meat. The BBQ pork bun was on the lower end of the spectrum, too much dough/bun and not enough cha siew filling. \n\nMost of the tables have soy sauce spilled from whoever sat there last. You are to bus and clean your own table. People, please be courteous and pick up after youself! I didn't have to fight for tables late afternoon but a clean table was actually hard to find.

Service is fast and to the point, so don't expect much pleasantries. There's a system of pink half sheets of papers to circle your menu choices, but sometimes there are no pink papers available. VERY Important: if the price is 3 for $1.50, then ONE order has 3 pieces. Therefore, if u write 3 on the pink sheet, that means u are ordering 9 pieces.\n\nI will not mince words, these women can be VERY rude, mean and angry looking. Often impatient and constantly sighing when helping customers. ALWAYS with a long face and murmuring nonsense (swearing in Chinese). Usually native Chinese speakers are attended first, while ignoring other customers in line and making them wait. Only one woman is half-pleasant (only when the others are not around, she has short black hair and timid demeanor), the rest are ALL angry and bitter old women. IF u decide to shop here, my advice is to don't get upset, think positive. These are just minor annoyances in life. Like Bobby McFerrin's song says, \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\".\n\nMost Dim Sum is best when hot, so the ideal time to buy is during midmorning when the food comes out of the kitchen. Many of the steamed dumplings are good (shrimp with taro, etc.). I specially like the fried taro dumplings and their baked BBQ pork buns, it has a good amount of tasty chopped pork meat inside. Most people order to go, but there's also a few tables if you want to eat inside.\n\nThe steamed dim sum in the round metal steamers are made fresh daily (the employees get to take home the steamed leftovers at the end of the day). But the fried and baked dim sum on the glass display could be from the day before. The women control the flow of dim sum that comes from the kitchen by yelling what items need restocking. If you only see a few pieces on the glass display early on the day, those are OLD. When you see a whole tray or more than half tray full, then those were made fresh that day.\n\nIn this area of Clement street, Wing Lee Bakery (a lot nicer to customers) and Good Luck Dim Sum are the most popular shops.", "author": "Luis C."}

There's nothing better than eating some delicious dim sum after getting your pearly whites cleaned.\n\nAnyway, about the food. Good Luck Dim Sum is definitely a hole in the wall - a tiny little place stuck in between two. Usually, there's a long line of people getting as much dim sum as they can. Prices are relatively low compared to other dim sum places I've been to (especially in SoCal - I have yet to see a place like this there, or maybe I haven't looked hard enough). Although the prices are low, the quality of the dim sum makes it seem like it costs so much more. \n\nI usually get the shui mai, the one with the shrimp, and the one with the chives. My bad for not remembering most of the names for these delicious little things, but what I remember is how they taste. \n\nIf you choose to dine in, they put all the dim sum in a little tray, like one of those trays they put hot dogs in. Good Luck Dim Sum makes you feel like you're at home - sitting down in one of the tables is usually someone making some fresh dim sum. While some people may be appalled to see that, but I have no problem with it. I seem to find it a bit comforting...but then again that's just me.\n\nAnyway, 5 stars.

What better way to celebrate an ROTD for a dim sum-centric review than by reviewing another dim sum joint?\n\nAnyway, this place has 300+ reviews so I doubt anything I say will be groundbreaking, but for cheap, fast food, and decent dim sum, this is your best bet.  You can get a drink and eat 'til you're full for right around $5 -- how great is that?\n\nI preferred Ocean even though they were more expensive because they were more of a sit-down place and had a wider selection of dim sum (including some great veg options), but Ocean is long dead and gone and Good Luck is now the place to go.  Some notes:\n\nHar gow: Okay, but nothing special.  The shrimp/taro dumplings and shrimp/chive dumplings are better options at the same price.\n\nChar siu bao: Not bad, but Gourmet's is better.\n\nLuo bo bing: Much less greasier than Gourmet's.\n\nChive dumpling: OM NOM NOM.\n\nYu jiao (deep-fried stuffed taro): Not bad.  Ocean's was better, but like I said, Ocean is gone.\n\nOverall: Much less greasy food than at Gourmet Dim Sum, and even though the atmosphere is spartan it's not as much of a dive as Gourmet.  Food at Good Luck tends to run cold on chilly, windy days because they leave their door wide open.  They could do with shutting the door, turning up the heat, or zapping some items in a microwave or salamander before handing it to you (the way Gourmet does for you without you having to ask).\n\nIn conclusion: OM NOM NOM.", "author": "James L."}

Normally at sit down dim sum places, you're paying $2.50 plus for Ha Gow that is not as good as these.

They put everything together and you won't have to be worried about their English competency.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-12-05", "description": "I'm fairly sure Good Luck employs some kind of tractor beam, because even when I'm hungry in the Inner Richmond and know I should try something different, I always always end up back at Good Luck.  It might be because it was the first dim sum I ever had in San Francisco or it might be because I am painfully and blindingly white, but I really do think that Good Luck is the best dim sum experience that I've had in this city so far.\n\nToday, my boyfriend and I had the shrimp and chive dumplings, the chicken siu mai, the crystal dumplings, the vegetable pork bun, and some chicken sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf.  And tea.  It was $10.  In fact, every time I've gone it has cost about $5 per person and I've left stuffed, so I would say that's fairly standard.\n\nThings I like about individual items: The sticky rice is almost unbearably good - the flavor is very rich and the texture so creamy!  The fried taro dumplings are some of my favorite things to have there.  I had them once and I can't stop thinking about them - the skin is thick and chewy, and the filling is rich and nutty.  And it's fried!  What's not to love?  The veggie and pork bun has a lot of ginger in it, which adds a whole new dimension to the typical meat-on-starchfest that is dim sum.  And the BBQ pork bun: because sometimes you really do want a meat-on-starchfest.\n\nThings I like about the food in general: I haven't gotten anything there that wasn't incredibly flavorful and rich, but they manage to do so without an off-putting amount of oil.  Even the predominantly veggie-based fillings glom together perfectly, making it really easy to enjoy every component of every morsel in every bite.  The wrappers are tasty, too, be they soft and fluffy or smooth, thick, and chewy.  And whatever brand of soy sauce they use is rad (I know that's probably an ignorant thing to say, but I've had a fair amount of dark soy sauce and this stuff is better - I swear!).\n\nMost people don't like the ambiance of eating there, but I have to say i really do.  If you can manage to snag a table, sitting there and gorging yourself in the comfortingly shabby dining area and watching everyone talk, eat, yell, and otherwise bustle around you is a very good time.  It's not a fine dining experience, but I don't really think it's supposed to be.  I think that Good Luck is exactly what it has set out to be, and for that I am always happy to shell out my $5.", "author": "Becca S."}

It was a large round bun that was pan-fried after it was cooked, to give it a crispy bottom, similar to a potsticker.

I saw at least 4 tourists stand in line during my 20 minute meal.  I'm guessing Good Luck Dim Sum came up first on the yelp search.\n\nI normally don't write reviews until I have made an informed decision/comparison with a large sample size.\n\nI have been raised on dim sum.  My standard of comparison is dim sum from Hong Kong, where dim sum is cheap, tasty, large, and fresh.\n\nI normally get my dim sum from Good Mong Kok (in the original china town).  The reason why I go here is because I enjoy eating dim sum at home where it is quiet and clean, allowing me to focus on the quality of the food.  The reason why I decided not to go to GMK today is because it was raining - GMK does not have any tables to sit at.  Also, I wanted to try some other highly rated yelp dim sum \"restaurant\".\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum has NOTHING on Good Mong Kok.  I urge you to try GMK.  Their dim sum is the closest I have had to Hong Kong dim sum.  The price is the same at GMK as well.\n\nHere is why I thought GLDS was below my standard:\n\nCha Siu Bao/Pork Bun - The filling is made mostly of paste and lard.  Perhaps 20% was made of real pork.  You might like how mystery paste and lard taste, but you're totally getting ripped off with 20% real bbq pork filling.\n\nHar Gao/Shrimp Dumpling - These are tiny in comparison to GMK...maybe 20% smaller.  GMK uses more real shrimp for filling.\n\nFried Triangle Pastry filled with beef and taro - Again, this was filled mostly with taro paste.  There was SO little ground beef.  This is NOT normal.  You're getting ripped off with filling.\n\nDan Tat/Egg Custard - This was ok...a little small..but still ok.  I'm not really a dan tat connoisseur.\n\nIn general, most of their dim sum was filled with fillers...this is NOT good dim sum.  If I had to compare, I would say that Good Luck Dim Sum is even worse than the dim sum offered in the South Bay...that is PRETTY BAD.\n\nPERHAPS this is one of the better places in this area, but the original China town has better restaurants.  I give this place 2 stars:\n\n1st star:  Cheap - $1.50 for 3 pieces\n2nd star:  Place to sit + \"tolerable to average\" dim sum + hits the spot when you're craving dim sum\n\nIf you do decide to go to Good Mongkok instead of Good Luck, be aware that there are NO tables at GMK.  You'll need to stand somewhere along the street or eat at a park if you want to eat your dim sum while it is still warm.", "author": "Jonathan T."}

By the time you get it all to the table it's just not that warm, and loses some of its appeal.  It's too bad because some things really did seem good - pork buns, sticky rice with chicken, spare ribs, lots of the dumplings/pot stickers.  But the nasty dirty tables, long lines and waiting in a cramped space as people keep trying to get by, and most important - cold food - just took away from it.  Yes it's cheap, but, oh well.  Lots of places in CHinatown are pretty cheap, but in our estimation they are  more enjoyable.\n\nWe love appetizers, but it would've been nice to have some other options - any sort of Chinese vegetables for example, or a little more with meat.  The menu is limited, and we honestly didn't know what some things were.  We certainly didn't go here with expectations of it being like a sit down place, but it still underwhelmed us.", "author": "D R."}

I have had terrible \"Chinese\" food at the Tonga Room, and liked what I had at House Of Nanking, only to see it raked by Chinese reviewers. \n\n Sigh.\n\nI happened upon Good Luck Dim Sum while driving along Clement with a friend, no prior notice.  I ordered what looked good (\"two of those, three of these and um, oh!  Two of those\").   Everything was much better than any dim sum I've had elsewhere in San Francisco, enough to make me curious about Yelping Dim Sum and trying places that get the highest raves to see how things balance out.   I'll get back to you.\n\nDo they really use lard?  Well bless their souls!\n\nI especially liked the pork buns, which actually had some barbecued pork in them.  Even the shrimp dumplings were nice, with a good flavor of shrimp, but no so much so you began to wonder why...\n\nWe then went to one of those old palaces, upstairs off of Grant (with my cousin's 20% off coupon) and started with dim sum, and wow--how awful.  So, in one week I had the best (I've had) and the worst (I've had) and it hasn't been that long since we ate at a little place on O'Farrell which I thought was very good, but not quite so much so as Good Luck Dim Sum.\n\nYelpers who hate anyplace that costs more than what they think they would have paid in 1935 should like Good Luck.  I walked out with what I thought was quite a bit of food, and I the bill came to $12.00.\n\nI didn't find the staff to be all that rude.

Instead, you have three crabby Chinese ladies barking at you and waiting for you to make your order already.  If you aren't ready, prepare for a mean, tired look.\n\nBut cheap bastards like me are always ready for super deals like this.  The problem here is that if you've never had dim sum, you won't know what to order.  It's probably best to just point at what you want and hope you like it.\n\nI had a feeling the place was pretty good because I saw a bunch of white folk waiting in line.  Hey, if white folk can eat it, then it's gotta be pretty good Chinese food right?  That is to say, it probably isn't too exotic.\n\nFor less than $5, you can get a decent amount of food.  Yeah, dim sum doesn't exactly fill you up, but if you get enough of 'em in you, you'll be happy.  Maybe not satisfied, but happy.  Heck, now that I think about it, maybe buying a bag of potstickers at Trader Joe's for about the same amount might be an even better idea.\n\nBut I digress.

At first glance the menu is slightly confusing because you read \"3 items $1.60\" so it would appear that you order 3 pieces of various dim sum dishes, for $1.60. This is not the case - each order is 3 pieces, and each order is $1.60. So far so good - very reasonably priced compared to a sit-down tea house.\n\nFlavors and textures were delicious and authentic - it's what you would get in Hong Kong or Taiwan. The usual stuff like turnip cake, siu mai, har gow were excellent. But what I really enjoyed was seeing the old school faves - bai tang gao (sweet rice cake), ma la gao (sponge cake), and dan ta (custard pastry). Like a trip down dim sum memory lane.\n\nMy one complaint would have to be their order management process. They had 3 or 4 people behind the counter, handling each order individually and wasting time bumping into each other. This caused the line to back up. I think it would be much better for their customers (and their business) if they organized their set up so that one person handled certain items (i.e. 1 person for the things behind the glass, 1 person for things in the steamers, 1 person for everything near the window) and processed quickly.\n\nI would recommend this place to friends and definitely come back.", "author": "Richard Z."}

Asian food on the cheap, some will love it and some with more refined palates will not like some items but as my friend said best... you get what you pay for. We ordered a boatload since this was my first REAL journey for \"dim sum\" outside a sample or two so we ordered Sweet Rice Bun, Baked BBQ Pork Bun, Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, Shrimp Dumplings, pork shu mai, beef shu mai, har gow, chicken siu mai, Hom Sui Gok, Chive dumplings w/ shrimp, Steamed Pork Dumplings, seasame ball, custard, and a egg yolk bun. We got all this which included two orders of certain items and two drinks for $16.60.  Recession budget... accomplished.\n\nCONS \nThe steamed bun seemed overly doughy. The Siu Mai (pork, beef, chicken) tasted like mystery meat. The sesame balls we were only able to eat a couple bites of, the filling just didn't mesh well with us. The other items, besides the ones listed below, while not terrible were nothing special, just food. They run out of food fast so you have to make sure you get there early as two items we had to substitute something else for. Service was slower than we heard, only 5 people in line and it took 21 minutes to leave. Parking is TERRIBLE. \n\nPROS \nContrary to some, the food was hot and looked mostly appealing, and this is even after calling ahead, stood in line for 10 minutes (we'll talk about that later), and drove about 7 minutes to the spot we ate at. The pieces were HUGE compared to other dum sum I had seen. Chive and shrimp dumplings were excellent, nice mix of shrimp and not just chives and a micro shrimp. BBQ baked bun was a good mix between sweet and salty. The sweet rice bun made me rediscover my inner 1/16th Asian side. \n\nWe heard all the comical or honest reviews about this place having rude workers however I don't think they are rude as much as extremely busy. It just reminded me of my visit to NYC with food vendors and shops where they're trying to move you along so the line can get shorter and have no time for small talk. Piece of advice... fill out your pink order form since we witnessed what happens to anyone who dares try the twice menu over routine... not pretty. I stand 6' and weigh on the higher portion of 200lb club, played football, went to bars with drunk idiots but never felt as intimidated as I felt glaring into the eyes of those tiny Asian ladies. =) I had to laugh since I almost felt like Seinfeld did with the infamous \"Soup Nazi\" episode: \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J02RdkvI6zo&feature=related \n\nAlthough we called ahead when coming in we didn't know do we stand in line or just step to the counter but the stern looks by the ladies just had us jump in line since we saw only 5 people in line. While one lady was very short another suggested something else and wished us well on our trip so maybe bark worse than bite. =) \n\nSo overall on the fence with this place... a few items we really enjoyed, some we did not and with soo many dim sum places in the city not sure this is a \"must have\" as others feel but it definitely gave us our money's worth on the experience alone.", "author": "Mike D."}

The restaurant world has yet to bridge the gap between the Pacific-rim food that made California famous, and the lower-end Chinese food which, in the case of Good Luck Dim Sum, is motherf**king incredible.\n\nOnce you brave the line that snakes out the door, order one of the huge variety of dumplings and either take them home or try your luck with a table out back. I had the crystal, shrimp/chive, and pork/chive dumplings with a pork bun on top and a bottle of water. The whole thing cost me-- ready?-- $7.50. So, to recap, there were 12 items there (each order of dumplings contains 3 pieces), for less than $8. Incredible. The better part is that the dumplings were succulent, savory, and full of flavor.

Most importantly the CHIVE DUMPLINGS...they are, by far, the best dumplings that they offer (and so hard to find at other dim sum places). \n\nThe other thing that we love are the \"colorful\" folks that you'll meet here. For example, on our most recent visit over this past weekend we encountered: \n\n-\"The Bathroom Bandit\"- while waiting in line to use the restroom, I reached out to open the door to enter the restroom, when a woman swooped in and closed the door quickly behind her. I was aghast in disbelief and could do nothing but wait for the bandit to exit... \n\n-\"The Cutter\"- Remember middle school? Remember those crazy kids that cut in the lunch line and everyone shouted, \"Cutter, cutter!\" So you'll need to beware of \"the cutter\" while waiting in line to place your order. While I was experiencing the \"bathroom bandit\", my tall & hunky husband experienced \"the cutter\". Be aware of a very short Asian woman when waiting to order- 'cause she'll swoop right in front of you when you're glancing over your shoulder to see what commotion is happening behind you in the bathroom line. \n\n-\"The Plastic Cutlery Police\"- After exiting the restroom, I quickly spotted an empty table and nabbed it (a big victory at GLDS). My husband proudly arrived with a tray overflowing with dumplings and 2 little paper trays & 2 plastic forks. Problem= he had asked for 3 trays & 3 forks since there were 3 diners in our group. He returned to the counter to ask for 1 more set of \"serving pieces\". The place was jam-packed with people (as it always is) and the line formed a solid wall down the center of the restaurant- the \"cutlery police\" woman left her post at the steamers and came back to our table to find that there were, in fact, 3 diners. She quickly issued the third fork & paper tray. Don't even think of asking for extra cutlery at GLDS...they just won't have it!\n\nWe've never left there without a big laugh!

As an LA native visiting SF, I had hoped that with a four star rating and 400+ reviews that it would be a safe bet for us but we were soooooooo wrong. For starters, all the dumplings were cold and the edges of the steamed dumplings were hard. Again, maybe it's because we came 2 1/2 hours before closing but all I know is had this been even one of the worse dim sum places in Alhambra or Monterey Park, 3:30 or not my buns would not be cold and hard like that. If you're looking for some good SF dim sum, you may want to keep looking because this place was horrid and I'm only talking about the food!\n\nAs far as the service goes, the lady charged us  $.10 for an extra paper plate. My bf gave her a quarter and told her to keep the change since she seemed so hard up. She acted like we were asking to use fine china or something.\n\nIn the end, I was completely unsatisfied but I got over it really quick because we only spent 7 bucks.  I thought about giving the dumplings to a homeless person but I don't think he would eaten it either. We were better off splitting a chowder bowl at the Wharf.\n\nLet me reiterate....this place is yuck yuck yuck and it serves crap crap crap!!!!", "author": "Agnes D."}

Take that and a pen and decide what you want. Write it on the pink menu (by circling the item and indicating the number of sets you want).

How lucky. =D\n\nI've lived in SF for nearly a dozen years in the Inner Richmond, and I've probably been to Good Luck Dim Sum more than any establishment in Northern California. How is Good Luck different than the dozens of take-out dim sum joints on Clement? Why is Good Luck my unquestionable SF take-out dim summery of choice?\n\nThree words: \"Char Siu Bao\" -- their steamed barbecue pork buns.\n\nScientifically speaking, pork buns are the true measure of dim summery. Try a dozen different Chinese buns, and you might find buns like these:\n\n#1. Buns hard as rocks!\n#2. Buns too tough to chew!\n#3. Squishy, soggy buns!\n#4. Meatless buns!\n#5. Fowl buns!\n#6. Misshapen buns!\n#7. Grotesquely huge buns!\n#8. Tiny buns!\n#9. Waaay overpriced buns!\n#10. Tasteless buns!\n#11. Cold, frigid buns!\n \nAnd then you try Good Luck's #12. Mmmmm, nummy, perfect buns!\n\nNICE BUNS! -- FIVE STARS!\n\nOkay, okay, silliness aside, they're also pretty hot buns.\n\n=D\n\nIn ten years, the price has gone from $1.10 for three, to $1.50 for three. Now that's just amazing.\n\nBeware, bun-lovers: the lines here are insane. There are lines at eight in the morning. Saturday at noon, you're easily looking at a half hour to 45-minute wait for take-out dim sum.\n\nNow here's the trick! If you've got a large order, you can call in advance and say, \"I'd like your hot buns tomorrow at noon,\" and when you show up, your buns will be waiting. Skip the line, while everyone else gives you dirty looks. Now this is where you pay, open up one of Good Luck's hot pink boxes and enjoy a sample of one of your hot buns in front of everyone...\n\nI'll leave you with some favorites:\n- the Rice Porridge is great for breakfast and dirty cheap at a buck and change.\n- Chive Dumplings are an undiscovered squishy culinary treasure, seriously.\n- I've yet to find any restaurant that serves crispier Chinese Egg Rolls.\n- And if your mouth still craves some fun, grab a handful of Good Luck's Sweet Rice Buns. =)", "author": "Perci N."}

The freshness of the ingredients (important for dim sum) is especially impressive.  The in-house seating leaves a little to be desired, I'd only eat there in a pinch and recommend viewing this place as more of a takeout place.  At first the table area seems fine, but then you realize it's self-serve, hard to get even a glass of water to go with your meal, and the dim sum line often extends chaotically into the seating area.  There's usually a long line here, and the serving crew tends to be a little grumpy if you don't order according to some cryptic system they've devised.  Kind of like the Seinfeld Soup Nazi in that respect.  \n\nHowever, the dim sum here is so great for the price, it overpowers Good Luck's shortcomings.  It's that good.

I had never been here before, so I was unaccustomed to the procedure of figuring out what you want beore you order, circling the desired items on a menu. My inexperience became quite evident when the person working there started to box up an ungodly amount of food...I guess that when it says \"3 for $0.XX,\" that means for every item you circle, you get three of that for the price shown.  Whoops! The line was quite long, so we didn't bother to downsize our order...nevertheless, we ended up with a large box full of dim sum goodies for around $10. Nuts!\n\nIt's not the most amazing dim sum ever, but it was tasty enough given the rock bottom prices. I liked the various shrimp dumplings (plain shrimp and the shrimp and chive), though the wrappers on the dumplings were  quite heavy and kept falling apart. The fried taro ball was tasty, with ground pork inside. Steamed BBQ pork buns were alright, neither impressive nor offensive. Turnip cakes, ehhh, too dry, I guess. Egg custard tarts...wow, so wonderful and custardy fresh! Then there were the sweet rice balls with coconut and peanut filling...GET THIS!  It's like a snowball of sweet, crunchy, flaky love. Definitely the highlight for me!\n\nGLDS is a hit and run type of place, so don't expect restaurant service or fancy digs. There does appear to be some order in the madness, so pay attention to what other people are doing and keep your eye on the fresh stuff that comes out. Despite the chaotic atmosphere, the food is cheap and decent. No wonder Good Luck Dim Sum is a neighborhood favorite for many Yelpers.

Soft chewy bread and sweet and salty pork stuff inside.  Super cheap and super yummy and apparently all their dim sum is good luck.  I can only attest to the fact that they ARE because my party was a hit and though the last half of the night was a drunken haze I remember the shu mai and the pork buns vividly.", "author": "Jay H."}

I went today, and they served us cold dumplings, cold egg rolls, cold fried shrimp. Every table in the place was filthy with rings of chili sauce, spilled tea, remnants of food. They never did get around to cleaning the tables, even after we pointed out there weren't any clean ones. Resigned to our dirty table, we asked for some soy sauce, and they gave us teriyaki sauce. They knew it was teriyaki sauce, but thought we might not notice? Nothing was edible, it was claggy and gelatinous and, well, like cold grease. It was, frankly, disgusting.  If I could give it no stars, I would. \n\nI have been going there out of habit,  but now I won't be going back. I'm on the hunt for some better all day dim sum.", "author": "Caterina F."}

I was starving, and yet didn't even finish my lo mai gai, it was downright nasty.\n\nStaff seemed to be functioning in some sort of slow-motion total chaos, as they'd sort of move around one another behind the counter, taking bits of pieces of people's orders and yet not really accomplishing much of anything. I'm hardly one to complain about \"poor service\" in Chinese restaurants where most things are under $1.50 (hell, I gave D&A Cafe 4 stars...) but there's a difference between brusque efficiency and just being dour and discombobulated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-11", "description": "A few weeks ago, I fell upon the Yelp review for this place, and since then, I'd been craving dim sum like none other.  Given the distance, traveling out to SF for good dim sum in the morning is not readily feasible, but a few times in the last weeks, I had the opportunity to go out for breakfast in the city, and of course, Good Luck Dim Sum came to mind immediately.  Afterall, with so many yelpers raving about this place - - it just HAD to be good.\n\"Best dim sum'....?\n\nSo two of us walked into this place at 9 AM one morning.  Small store, with perhaps 8-10 tables at which to sit and eat, and a counter upfront with several Asian servers.  I don't think they were Chinese, as many Chinese people seemed to be entering and speaking in English rather than Chinese.  \nIt's a pretty dinky place, but it did look clean.\n\nYou grab a piece of paper to order when it hits you - - these prices are ridiculously low!!!  3 siu-mai for only $1.50?  \"Wow, if this is good.... I could eat like a king every single day,\" I thought to myself.... as I circled this, that, and everything else.  Compared to what we'd normally eat, it was a small order, but we both had our doubts as to whether or not this place would really be good.  Both of us have had the world's best dim sum places, and a small little place like this would have a hard time measuring up... so we'd place a small order and then if it really is that good - - we'll clean out the place.  So goes the plan, anyhow.\n\nAlright.  Presentaton is really important in my mind.  I know when I cook something, I don't want to just slop it onto paper plates - I want to present it so that the dish is enhanced.  At Good Luck, they seem to have some major ISSUE with using those cheap styrofoam containers..... use the smallest possible to pack in as much dim sum you can without wasting any space at all.  Just stuff it in?  We told them we planned to eat here and they threw it onto a plate.  Dim Sum house with no hot tea?  Well, they do have it but it's tea bags... they give you hot water, you make your own tea.  What on earth!?!!?\n\nFinally we sit down.\nTake a bite of this.\nTake a bite of that.\nWe both remain silent for awhile before we look up and simulataneously ask:  \"What do you think?\"  Given the expression on our faces, it was clear that neither party was impressed.  AT ALL.\n\nThere are not many things in the world that are worse than COLD Dim Sum.  The entire point of dim sum and the carts is to serve it piping hot.  Something this greasy cannot be tasted COLD or lukewarm!!!  RULE #1, people!  We can barely finish the small amount we order, and totally disappointed, with me mumbling, \"But the yelpers said it was the best dim sum in CA.... I don't get it.\"\n\nI am nothing if not forgiving, so in Good Luck's defense, I will add in that once I got home, I eyed my little styrofoam container with the suspect food in it and decided to nuke the hell out of it to taste it again - - hot.  Amazing what a little heat can do, folks.  The taste improved tenfold, and if it had been steamed hot -  I suspect it would have been even better.\n\nOK - so the dim sum in itself is pretty good.  Not great, and not even CLOSE to being \"the best\" in any area, but pretty good.  But for the really nasty and unfriendly service (even when not busy) and serving it cold, not to mention being so cheap with their containers - -  I ding this place 2 stars to give it a final 3-stars.  I didn't have any of the buns so will overlook the \"best buns\" comment, but \"best dim sum\" it is not.  It is, however, good dim sum that is conveniently available for takeout, and as cheap of a meal as you can get anywhere in SF.  Worth going to?  Sure.  Just be sure to go home and NUKE it.  Don't eat it there, whatever you do!!!", "author": "Grace K."}

Don't let the interior stop you from ordering, there food isn't Yank Sing, but it is delicious. If I am on Clement Street, I will usually get some.\n\nAs to price, it is cheap, really cheap! You can get nine dumplings for less than four dollars and be very satisfied. Make sure you have cash, they do not take cards. When I used to host events in college, I used to order like 300 pieces for less than sixty dollars, which I think is impressive.\n\nThe food is tasty, a little bit greasy and without a digestive green tea, I don't suggest more than nine pieces. I have been known to over-indulge on Dim Sum and I feel it is my duty to tell people not to. My favorites there are the hao gao (shrimp) and the siu miu (the pork). \n\nIf you are hosting a big party on a limited budget, want to have a snack on Clement Street, or even a meal, Good Luck Dim Sum is a great place.

Mom and dad only get their dim sum from this place. For my aunt who lives in Taiwan, this is one of her favorite places in the world (literally) to get sesame balls (jian dui). My personal favorite: pan fried shrimp and chive dumplings, although you can't miss with any of their fantastic treats. \n\nWatch out - you gotta be super fast on the uptake.

The line is long but it does go really quickly.  The people getting the food is quite rude.  You can still get through customers quickly without the rudeness.  In their broken English, half the time I don't really understand what they are saying even though I'm trying really hard to understand.  I grew up with my parents speaking broken English; I thought I was used to it.  It doesn't help that they don't give a crap what you're saying on the other end.  I was really excited so I ordered quite a bit.  So when she told me she didn't have a dish and something pork I said oh okay thinking she was asking me if it was okay to sub another similar dish for that dish.  It's pretty hectic there, there's three people serving and asking at least three customers in line what they want. When I asked her if she got the chicken and sausage dish as well, she yelled at me rudely \"I TOLD YOU ALREADY I DON'T HAVE THAT.\"  And to add salt to the wound, rolled her eyes like I'm the one with English problems.  Anyways I liked that it was like $14 for two people and we were completely full and had left overs.

It's very cheap (about 50 cents a piece) and it will fill up two people with just 10 bucks. Regarding the flavor, every other dim sum tastes the same and after a while I don't know the difference any more between a shrimp dumpling and a pot sticker.

The dumpling skin is not too think, and you get a generous serving of tasty shrimp inside each one.\n\nSiu mai (pork) - these are a little greasy but are very flavourful and a good size.\n\nLo bak go (turnip cake) - usually my favourite dim sum item, i would say that they are only average to slightly above here. Still they are way better than the ones you buy in the store and are dirt cheap for $1.50.\n\nWu tau kau (fried taro dumpling) - again, a little greasy, but what do you expect - they are deep fried! very tasty and large too.\n\nLo mai gai (sticky rice with chicken in lotus leaf) - these are awesome. I think they're only $1.80 and are almost a whole meal! They even taste good if you re-steam them the next day.\n\nThe only dim sum they don't have which I like is cheung fun (rice noodle roll), which is a shame but not worthy of deducting a star. They have a bunch of other items on the other menu: bao, chicken feet etc which i haven't tried cos I can't really eat that much!\n\nOverall, excellent place for cheap, solo eats, or to take home for several people. The only downside is the lack of seating, during busy times you really need to hover around tables like vultures to ensure getting a seat.", "author": "Jeremy H."}

I can get cheaper and bigger shrimp dumplings in Chinatown. In fact almost everything is smaller portions than compared to normal dim sum take out joints, which this place is just that. You line up and they have a printed menu and pen on the counter for you. Although its not a giant menu I thought it was okay. Unfortunately by the time I got to the front of the line and turned in my slip with my choices, they did not have 2 of the items I had picked. And there was no offer of, \"I am sorry we do not have these items. Would you like to substitute with something else?\" Just the bum rush of having to pay. And after having to wait in line for 5-10 mins while I watched all the old Chinese men/women ahead of me buy boxes and boxes filled and leave. They could have given the courtesy of a minute to ask. That would have been nice. But seeing as the line was constant they probably didn't care about great individual customer service. Then to make matters worst I paid and sat in the very meager choices for seating just to find out that she screwed up my order. And I still think she over charged me but what am I to do? Argue with people who would not give me their  time of day nor speak English and understand English. It's not worth wasting my time to do so.

But there wasn't a line and they were fine with a verbal order.  The ladies have been noted as dim sum nazis.  I've been to hogie places in New Jersey that are pretty similar so it didn't really phase me.  In fact, at the hogie place I would stand outside and squint to read the menu because as soon as you step in the door they start yelling at you if you don't know what you want.  So GLDS ladies really weren't that bad in my opinion.   You just have to be ready to jump in there.\n\nThat said, GLDS is a cut-to-the-chase kinda spot.  Know what you want, order it, eat and enjoy.  Don't worry if the table is sticky or why the soy sauce is almost like teriyaki.  Don't worry about whether you have to go bad enough to brave the bathroom.  Don't worry about if the item is too greasy or too doughy...just eat and enjoy.  Seriously.  It's cheap and good.  That's all you need to know ;)", "author": "Sonic D."}

My friends and I call them the Dim Sum Nazis in reference to the Soup Nazi episode of Seinfeld.\n\nMy friend went there once to get food for his work crew.  He ordered over $40 worth of dim sum, which at Good Luck is a lot of food.  As they were packing the food, he asked for forks.  Rather than simply drop a few in, there was a bunch of grumbling and a \"I have to check.\"  For plastic forks!  My friend was totally pissed and has vowed never to go back, but I can't help laughing at the story every time he re-tells it as a way to wave off prospective Good Luck customers.  But he's got it right, if customers don't know what they're doing or stray from a very fixed set of steps in the transaction, there's grousing.  Hence the Dim Sum Nazi reference.  \n\nBut the dim sum is good and worth waiting for.  Don't eat there (unless you like sitting next to a perpetual line of folks getting dim sum to-go.

I mean, I don't expect great service at a place like this, but I am chinese and I feel embarrassed and misrepresented by these SLOW WORKING chinese ladies.  Usually, when you see a long line, you would like to work faster and get even more business, but whoever hired these ladies, they are just ruining your business.\n\nI usually prefer to eat down the street, where the dim sum is better, more fresh and at least better service.  The reason why I decided to come to this place was, I kept seeing long lines and heard that it's \"good\".  Before this previous experience, I tried lining up before, but I was pissed at watching these woman work.  So therefore, I gave up lining up.  Today there was no line, so I decided to try.  The woman was RUDE and I asked for tea (which I had no problem paying for), however, I speak fluent cantonese, yet, I'm not sure if she knows how to comprehend it.  So therefore, they just gave me a cup and NO TEA BAG... then, as I was getting my hot water, I asked another woman about the tea bag.. and I was being nice about it.  And they were like \"blah blah blah\", so I loudly said \"nevermind\".  I would think there is some kind of service recovery, but no.  Next thing you know, you are sitting there eating the dim sum on a filthy dirty tray, with just a piece of plastic under your food...

She then asks my brother...\n\"Would you like any pork?\"\nMy brother looks at me from the corner of his eye and gets my attention. I know he's full because he's always been a light weight. He then says...\"I'm sorry, I don't eat pork.\" And we all thought that was that. \nThe ex then asks \"Why not?\"\nMy brother looks at me annoyed...\"Because pigs are dirty animals!\" I get that upset stomach feeling - knowing full well that nothing good will come of this.\n\"You know, cows are just as dirty as pigs are!\"\n\"No, I didn't know that, but that doesn't change the fact that pigs are dirty animals and I don't want any.\"\n\"But cows are dirty too and you ate cow earlier.\"\n\"Ok...\" He looks at me with a wink and proceeds with \"I don't eat pork because I was traumatized when I was a kid..ever since I watched Charlotte's Web...\"\n\"OIC...nevermind.\" She then excused herself to go to the bathroom. \nImmediately after she left, the whole table was like WTF!?!?!

Ah, just kidding, I love this place and if it was really unsanitary weak stomached woman that I am would have been rolling around on the floor with E. coli eons ago. Needless to say, if I don't get sick you won't.\n\nNow where else can you go, and snag three different items off the steam rack for just $1.30? These days you can't even do that at McDonald's. But this is something different. Why? Because the food along with being cheap is generally pretty good. I tend to get the turnip cake, a pork bun, and some other random item whenever I go here. The result is salty goodness that is both delicious and filling. I have been to other places like Canton, and things like the turnip cake were not much better there than here. The pork buns, though good and cheap as can be, are significantly better at higher end places in terms of the quality of pork. The pork in Good Luck's pork buns is usually of the drier kind, taking away the sensation that one gets when eating a bun with juicer pork such as can be found at higher end dim sumeries.  However, if its the fluffy outside of a pork bun that'll take care of your fix then you can easily be satisfied here. Besides who are you to expect the world if when you're paying less than 50 cents?\n\nIn terms of dumplings, seaseme balls, and other treats - especially of the non-meat kind - you will be a bit surprised at what you're getting for your money.

The ladies that serve you will certainly not be helpful and guide you. \n\nThat being said we had an opportunity to spend a long weekend in SF and ended up getting dim sum for two of our meals. We ate dumplings (all kinds), pork buns (baked and steam), sticky rice with sausage,  crispy taro root and siu mai. The only thing I would not recommend is the sticky rice - this is usually one of my favorites but it tasted bad and I ended up throwing it. Also it was expensive compared to the other things on teh menu. So stay away form it..\n\nI'll definitely be back....", "author": "P From CA C."}

The ladies behind the corner spoke enough English to answer our questions and were very friendly. We ordered 6 BBQ pork buns, 6 pork shu mai, 6 shrimp dumplings, and 4 custards for our family of 4 (including 2 small kids) and it came to just over $12. Wow. Unfortunately all the tables were taken so we had to take the food back to our hotel, but everything was absolutely delicious. The kids loved it as much as my husband and I. We have eaten at maybe 5 dim sum places in SF, Fremont, and Sacramento but this was easily the best and by far the least expensive. The selection was not nearly as large as at a sit-down Dim Sum place with carts, but they had all of our favorites. No problem with MSG overload that we have experienced elsewhere either.

I tasted several hole-in-the-wall dim sum shops in SF and selected Good Luck for supplying my family reunion picnic for 40 persons.  I made the perfect choice for several reasons.  I could place my order with a phone call a few days in advance.  They spoke English and understood my order and filled it to perfection.  I also asked them to put it in disposable aluminum catering trays, instead of their usual pink cake boxes.   I delivered the trays to them 2 days before my order pick-up.  They were able to hold onto the trays and use them when filling my order.  I asked that they don't smash the dim sum together in the tray.  The lady placed everything so beautifully and symmetrically.  It looked like an expensive restaurant had put the order together.  I ordered 11 different items and everyone of my 40 guests said it was the best dim sum they had.  They all asked where I had gotten it.  The size of each dumpling is very large, almost twice as large as something i would get at any other restaurant.  It was not overly oily.  There was a lot of meat and good fillings in each dumpling.  And no strange aftertaste nor saltiness.  And I was so impressed with the price.   It was very inexpensive.  When I budgeted the dim sum for 40 persons, I thought I would pay at least $15/person.  But with 11 items and 3 of them costing more than the usual .50/piece (baked char siu bao and sticky rice and the sesame coconut peanut puff), it only came to about $9/person with tax!  I am going to them again and again.  Great for large orders---they understand so well, and are easy to deal with.

However, we are disturbed by the presence of \"shark fin dumplings\" on the menu. I have lived in Asia and know how important this delicacy is in Chinese traditions, but hope we can educate people to make better choices in what they buy and eat. My ask is that others who love Good Luck Dim Sum all ask the owners to remove the shark fin dumplings and cease participating in the tragic market for Shark Fin.\n\nFor those that don't know, the controversy around shark finning stems from the fact that poachers cut off shark's fins while the animal is still alive. They than let it free into the ocean because shark's meat costs very little and there is no point occupying ship's storages with it. However, research shows cutting off shark's fins leads sharks to suffer a painful and slow death.  Injured animals returned into the ocean cannot properly navigate in water and hunt without their fins. They will also often get eaten by other predators unable to swim away.\n\nGood Luck Dim Sum, we love your dumplings. Please stop serving Shark Fin!", "author": "Steve F."}

The little pounded fried shrimp things\n5.  The fried rice ball with red bean cake in the middle\n6.  The flavor rice ball wrapped in paper, sorry I dont know the name\n7. Shu Mai\n\nI thought the following were just okay:\n1.  The pot sticker (for me, it was too bland)\n2.  The other big pot sticker like thing (I didnt like it....)\n\nThe price was reasonable, for $15, I had some for my daughter, and enough dinner for me and my husband last night, and lunch left over for me today.......", "author": "M R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-13", "description": "I tried this place out based on all the high recommendation from Yelp, and I agree, its really good! In fact, probably the best take-out dim sum in San Francisco, especially since Ho and Ho's over on 6th near Clement went under in 2001. Of course, the very best Dim Sum is still to be found in sit-down dim sum restaurants (the reason I give this four rather than five stars), but for take-out, this is as good as it gets and approaches restaurant-quality.\n\nI particularly recommend going here in late morning or early afternoon. While this is when the have the longest lines, they're also actively making dim sum in back, so the dim sum you'll get is more likely to be freshly prepared, rather than have been in a steamer for a few hours. Shark fin rolls, har gow, steamed pork buns, fried dumplings, steamed pork buns, and, for that matter, everything really are all good here. The only thing that wasn't good were the pot stickers, which had obviously been sitting out at room temperature for awhile and were lukewarm (yuck!).\n\nLike other dim sum take-outs, dining on-site is available, but like other such places, the atmosphere is harsh and utilitarian, and cleanliness only maintained by the occasional harsh antiseptic mop and wipe-up.\n\nAnd the price is right - you can easily get a filling lunch (with leftover snacks) for $6.", "author": "Peter W."}
