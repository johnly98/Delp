Many of them have their menus posted outside their windows for tourist and passerby to see, right?? They all have a variety of noodles, fried rice, beef, chicken, and pork dishes but how do I know what restaurants are good? We looked down the street and checked out the menu of this restaurant and as we had just barely started looking at the menu from their window the host came outside and motioned for us to come inside... uh, okay? At the time there was only one other customer dining inside.\n\nWe went in and were given a menu to look at. Hubby and I have our favorite Chinese food dishes that we order all the time when dining at a Chinese restaurant but this time we had their \"dinner for 2\" special for $26.95. The special came with wonton soup, pork chow mein, spring egg rolls, beef broccoli, and fortune cookies (not sure why they would add fortune cookies to the menu as if it counts, I thought that was standard). \n\nThe food tasted okay. Nothing that prompted for a second visit. Didn't like the egg rolls, tasted different from what my taste buds were used to. The fried rice and beef broccoli were decent but the chow mein was tasteless with lots of bean sprouts which hubby didn't like too much and the portions were small. The place filled up eventually because the host would do like what they did to us and he'd go outside and tell them to come in while people would just check out the menu from the window. So weird also that some restaurants were closed in the height of dinner time. Did I miss a Chinese holiday? \n\nThere are so many Chinese restaurants in Chinatown that it's easy to bypass this one over another one.\n\nReview #0917", "author": "May A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-06", "description": "Jeez! It finally dawned on me that the years have sneaked up on me. When I say I have been patronizing Bow Hon for a long time, I do mean a long time. I don't just mean years but decades. Yes, without being too specific.... multiple decades! Bow Hon and I go waaaay back.... back to the days of Nancy Kwan in Flower Drum Song. What? You don't remember Flower Drum Song? We are talking about Grant Avenue, San Francisco, CA, USA. http://youtu.be/Qzv_qAlDZyA Grant is a touristy thoroughfare in Chinatown where BH is located, lined with dragon-entwined lampposts during Chinese festivals and jammed with restaurants, quaint shops selling furniture, fabrics, souvenirs and knickknacks etc from China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n \nBH is in the heart of Chinatown. So don't expect anything fancy. BH was closed recently for a remodel and all they did to the interior was the bare minimum...a clean up, a new coat of paint and some furniture rearrangement. The fa\u00e7ade remained divey and the decor was still bare bones. It was kind of like Sam Wo, where the food was better than the ambiance.  The servers are the nicest ladies and even though English is barely spoken, it is not difficult to communicate with them.\n\nThe clay pot rice was undoubtedly BH's specialty from time immemorial. We went off the menu and ordered the classic Salted Fish with Pork Patty ($18.95 for 2), one of the most well loved Cantonese dishes. Traditionally, some bits of fat are preferred in the pork patty so the meat will stay moist and flavorful. However I applauded BH to be so thoughtful to use lean pork for me maybe because they recognized me as a long time customer. Paired with the pork was the salted fish in all its fragrance and saltiness. The rice was cooked in the clay pot creating the much-coveted crusty layer of slightly charred rice at the bottom (farn jiu). Think Rice Krispies.... only better! At the end of the meal, chicken broth with chopped cilantro was poured over the hardened rice crust and scraped off. That provided yet another end-of-the-meal treat.\n\nI can't believe I ordered the Cold Boiled Chicken (half-$10.95) with a side of Ginger and Scallions sauce. The cooking method is homey, simple and a favorite among gong-gongs (grandpas) and poh-pohs (grandmas) from the old country and you guess it.... Me as well! BH uses \"yellow feathered chicken\" (wong mo gai). This chicken is usually free ranged, smaller in size and has less fat. There is less meat, a little tougher but a lot more flavorful especially eaten with ginger and scallions. The chicken was really an accompaniment for the lo mein I ordered ($8.95). The noodles were tossed in soy, sugar and oyster sauce. I love to sprinkle some white pepper on the noodles, slurp them in between bites of the chicken, sucking the bones and gnawing on the wings. I hope I didn't sound too gross but that was the way to do it!\n\nBH has definitely withstood the test of time. It is with sadness and nostalgia to see the disappearance of so many iconic old school restaurants from the Chinatown dining scene recently. Time marches on ruthlessly, stops for no one, restaurants included. BH has created a well deserved  'clay pot rice' niche and hopefully they can continue to uphold this tradition for many more generations to come.", "author": "Geoff G."}

May be OVERCHARGED\nbecause orders are only written in Chinese and they seem to have a history of giving people the wrong checks (form Yelp reviews), making people pay for more than they ordered. This happened to me today but fortunately I read Chinese so I told the lady she made a mistake.\n\n2. Being forced to TIP\nFor their POOR to mediocre service, they force you to give them tips. Don't get me wrong, despite the kind of service I received, I was going to give this lady a 15% tips. But I was going to wait for her to give me the change first from my cash payment and then leave some tips on the table before leaving. When I put my cash payment on the check, she came and actually CHECKED (honestly, counted in front of me) how much I gave and when she realized I only paid roughly for the amount of the grand total, she ANGRILY said, \"NEED TO GIVE TIPS.\" (whuuut?!)\nDumbfounded, I said I was going to do so before I leave, but she insisted I do that before so I still ended up giving it to her together with the rest of the payment. The funny part was that while I was whipping out my money, she was still checking up on me to see if she was receiving her tips. Does she know that tips are OPTIONAL?!?! It's a norm, yes, but it is also a norm to NOT GIVE tips when the service sucks. And who yells at their customers to pay tips?!\n\n3. BLEH service\nThey're kind of short-staffed which resulted in a rather slowww service. I understand they may be stressed/tired but that's no excuse for treating customers poorly. So do them a favor and don't patronize this restaurant, in this way, they'll have enough hands and energy to deal with the customers they have.\n\nFood:\nThe food was somewhere between decent to good.

My friend and I wandered into Chinatown hoping for a hole in the wall type of spot. Unfortunately, this is not it. I ordered the hot and sour soup ($7.50) and Spring Egg Rolls ($5). We also each got a cup of tea, which was okay. I'm not sure if there's refills on it either. When the food came out, it was the smallest portion of food I've ever seen. For a Chinese spot, I usually find myself with leftovers, but definitely not the case. The spring rolls were chewy and the sweet and sour sauce that accompanied it were very watery. Even though it only came with three rolls, I was barely able to finish because it just tasted like fried dough. As for the hot and sour soup, it was okay. It sufficed my need, but wasn't satisfying and came in the smallest bowl ever. Do not even think about sharing your dishes here, which is usually the way Chinese places are --family-style.

After we were seated and given a menu it took 20 minutes to come back and take our order.  We asked for tea and never got it.

She was so distracted that she just put the order in, instead of confirming back with us what it will be.

We refused to get ripped off, so I compromised to charge us 1lbs. for the fish which clearly was!  My point being is they can't just list seasonal pricing, don't inform us of what that pricing is (it was written anywhere on the menu, and there wasn't a seasonal sign posted on the fish tank), and then just throw out a bogus number of what the fish weighed.\n\nCalled SFPD, long story short they mediated for us and the fish was dropped to 1lbs. on the bill.  They were arguing back and forth with the translating officer and was told to hush it because they kept interrupting when we were speaking.  Other patrons had issues with their bill and I even cited yelp reviews of others being ripped off.  An officer also stated that's the only spot in Chinatown they are always getting called to.

As I sat down, I ordered pot stickers because I love them and you can't go wrong. WRONG. They came out promptly but were shimmering with grease and were clearly overcooked. I didn't even need to take a bite, which I didn't. I thought I'd be safe by ordering the tofu and greens. The dish was ok, just very average. The waitress never checked on me and in fact stood outside the restaurant when I was ready for the check (there was only one other party of 3 in the restaurant). Finally I got the check and paid $24.80 for very little food. I agree with other reviewers: a ripoff. But the worst part was when I stood to put on my coat, she came over and picked up the money and said, \"Tip, tip.\" I actually didn't want to leave a tip since I hardly ate anything -- she didn't even ask why I didn't touch the potstickers and left half the other dish -- and the service was terrible. She positioned herself so that I couldn't leave and wrote on her hand, Tip. The other people were looking over. Unbelievable!!!! I lived in Taiwan for a year so I am familiar with Chinese culture. I was polite, didn't complain about anything but was treated very rudely. I just wanted to get out of there. Do not go to this restaurant!!", "author": "Jana E."}

The specialty not to be missed are the dishes braised in clay pots. On this visit I had my favorite, the vegan monk's stew. It is a lovely blend of dried mushrooms of several varieties, tofu, snow peas, green onions, bok choy, and rice noodles is a subtle braising broth. It is eaten over rice, and I finished by eating the well flavored rice noodles.\n\nMy only complaint on this visit was the inability to get the check, get the server to collect it (a cook ended up doing it), and as I walked out, the server chased me down, thinking I had stolen her pen, made hilarious by the fact that she could not speak English.

If I could give negative stars, I would.\n\nMy family and I were walking around Chinatown and decided to have dinner at Bow Hon because the menu looked interesting. I, unfortunately, decided not to check with my trusted Yelp before going in. \n\nFood wise, it deserves all the low ratings that it has received. Nothing special and I honestly suspect that some of the ingredients they used might have been going bad. We also ordered a clam dish in which more than half the clam shells were empty when the plate was put on our table. \n\nThe real kicker came when the check arrived though. At first my family couldn't understand why the check was so expensive. When we asked a hostess to run it through with us, it became clear. A line item labeled \"Rice F\" was apparently a 17.27% TIP that was automatically included in our bill that they didn't even tell us about. At that time, we were a little bit annoyed at the underhanded tactics but we paid the bill. When my mother commented to the hostess how the tip should be voluntary, the hostess literally walked off in the middle of the sentence. Yup, we were paying 17% for that type of service. \n\nBut that's not the defrauding I'm talking about. Right after the waitress walked off, we hear the lady from the next table exclaim that they miscalculated her bill and overcharged her by $4. You can pretty much guess what happened next. We took out a calculator and added our bill up. Surprise, surprise, we were overcharged as well. It was only a difference of $2 but at that point, it was about the principle of NOT DEFRAUDING YOUR CUSTOMERS. The rudest part is after they recalculated both our bills (my family and the family at the next table), they still had the audacity to charge the same tax and MANDATORY tip.

I don't think people should judge Bow Hon on atmosphere because it's simply not the type of place you come for a posh atmosphere: if you want that, go to Tommy Toy's. \n\nThe quality of food varies but the clay-pot dishes and seafood in general are the best bets and what people come here for time and again. The clams in black bean sauce is also a favorite. If you get clay-pot, go for seafood over anything else. People on here seem to complain that Bow Hon is overpriced and it seems a bit high on some items, certainly.  \n\nGolden Flower Vietnamese Restaurant, also in Chinatown but a Viet restaurant with clay-pot cooking Viet-style, is more fairly-priced and probably better overall quality, truth be told.", "author": "Mike W."}

(http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AA4EmkZwGfgpezbJH90WDw), there are few old school eateries in Chinatown these days.  New Lun Ting and the Empress of China, dinosaurs from the iconic '70's, are, along with this Grant Avenue staple, fading beacons of the neighborhood dining scene.  \nAs the food trends came and went, they lasted the test of time.  Sadly, Empress' impending closure will bring the number to two.\nThis small spot used to be next to a corner western grocery store (now a tourist gift store) to the left and an Orange Julius (now a coffee/snack shop) to the right.  My parents took us here for occasional family dinners to enjoy their specialties, clay pot dishes.  We used to order family style and have Sizzling chicken in gravy (jie jie gai) or beef brisket with radish chunks, Cantonese comfort food staples.\nUnfortunately, these family dinners have become in home events so takeout meals are our norm.  Since the aforementioned don't taste the same, I order a medium or large Preserved duck and sausage clay pot rice (lap mei), depending on our party size.  The preserved meats comes in a flat clamshell takeout box on a small bed of rice; the majority of the rice came packed in a large paper takeout box; note:  the rice is not as crispy as some may like.  There is another box with lettuce with oyster sauce.  There is also a tall soup container with the rinsed rice remains (fan jiu) from the clay pot.  A medium feeds a family of four with the addition of one or two side dishes.  The magic to this dish is that the rice and the meats were cooked on medium heat in a clay pot so that the protein flavors permeate into the rice.  They include a small container (bowl, if dining in) of sweet soy sauce to enhance the taste.\nYes, they're still cranking out those clay pot rice orders, but don't wait too long as who knows how much longer they'll be there.", "author": "Mike C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-10", "description": "CLAY POT RICE!!!\n\nThat is the only thing that is good here and the only thing I order.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired but seriously people, you are in Chinatown.  You're not in some fine dining ultra-chic, modern establishment.  You are in a typical Chinatown local eatery.  The portions of the other dishes are small and are hit and miss.  So my suggestion is basically to do what I do:  don't order them.  \n\nOrder the clay pot rice.  The selections of the various types of meat for your clay pot rice is on one page of the menu.  You have to order for two people but it's delicious.  Very few places do clay pot rice well but Bow Hon does.  So give it a try.  If you choose to order other items on the menu, then you're on your own.  \n\nStick with the clay pots.  They give you lettuce with oyster sauce on the house with your clay pot rice so you get your dose of veggies along with your choice of meats such as preserved duck, chinese sausage, etc.  Then after you've eaten all the meats and rice, they will make a soup from your clay pot.  It's a simple soup.  They put some basil and let the clay pot flavor take over.  Don't forget to ask them to make the soup.  It's great.\n\nThis is not earth-shattering food.  It's very typical Chinese cuisine so your life will not be changed by coming here but you will enjoy a good deal.", "author": "Chrys S."}

I have 5 words for you. Go. To. Chinese. Buffet. Seriously. You will get the right stuff at the right price. Trying to get Chinese American food here is a grave mistake and a waste of your money. And yes, dim sum portions are small. And expensive if you get them not in a dedicated dim sum restaurant.\n\nNow, to the review. I think Bow Hon is great if you like real Chinese food and are not afraid to experiment. Today we tried among other things a dish with a really funny name. Something like 'Sauteed Bok Choy In Person' (likely, a bad translation). It was just steamed Chinese cabbage but with a very delicious sauce. We ate it down to the last leaf. We also got a seafood clay pot (too much fishcake and tofu, not enough seafood, but still nicely tasting), steamed fish in wine sauce (only okay for me but my friend loved it), and sesame balls (soft and yummy). \n\nSo my recipe is be brave, try new, share with friends or family, and you'll be rewarded.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-26", "description": "All I have to say is that you have to try the sashimi/raw fish salad and their clay pots which are pretty much what Bow Hon is known for. It was a fairly large space with 2 floors and they had a cool dumbwaiter (aka food elevator) that transported food from the kitchen downstairs to the tables upstairs where we were. \n\nService was decent with our waitress checking on us regularly but she tended to forget things we requested and the food didn't come out as quickly compared to other Chinese restaurants I have been to. The floor was super sticky for some reason too so our chairs were difficult to move around most of the evening. At least no one left hungry after our meal here, that's for sure!\n\nThe special sashimi salad platter (not sure of the price but probably close to $40) was amazing! There was a zesty lemon flavor with a lot of crunch.  It was comprised of fried wonton strips, fried vermicelli, red pickled ginger, roasted peanuts, cilantro, ground peppercorns, and fresh pieces of raw fish/squid. I came back for seconds! I think it comes in smaller sizes as well but this platter fed 9 of us. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AtU4bqmaF5Aw3zc1_n68Kg?select=dBntiM9bb-802gk6LdL48w) Here's a close up shot. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AtU4bqmaF5Aw3zc1_n68Kg?select=-KNJzmfGtaAsCEXJYrZgag)\n\nSome other dishes we ordered were clams in a black bean sauce and Chinese broccoli with beef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AtU4bqmaF5Aw3zc1_n68Kg?select=8Ts9R-3cA_Awdv3lGywYgQ). Both were fairly large portions and tasted great! The 3rd dish accompanied our clay pot order which included preserved duck and Chinese sausage...yum! They cooked it with the meat on top of the rice so that the flavors infused into it (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/AtU4bqmaF5Aw3zc1_n68Kg?select=5RFGWo-T41GFaQJHQ5BlMg). The rice was piping hot, delicious, and went well with the salty, preserved meats. After the rice was all done, our waitress poured some soup into the clay pot to make porridge with the hardened rice on the bottom. So good! Totally worth $19 since it fed so many of us and we got 2 courses in one. \n\nNeedless to say, my belly was bursting when it was time to leave. I want to try their other clay pots next time!

She said they served dim sum and that it was \"very good\" and \"much better than the other restaurants around the area which are tourist traps\". This was around lunch time on a Friday by the way. So we go in, didn't get served tea right away which was kind of strange. And then realized that we had to request it (it's $1.50 btw!) Tea is usually free at other Chinese places so I thought it was weird! We ordered many of the dim sum dishes- which were all really bad. The portions were tiny for $3.95 each dish??? Everything we had tasted old, and not fresh at all. I think it was definitely frozen and they simply heated it up. But even the frozen stuff you get at grocery stores taste better. The menu was misleading. The pictures shows 4 har gow, 4 siu mai, etc. But in the tiny text written below it in Chinese it says there are 3. It was so bad that we couldn't even finish our food even though it was such a tiny portion. Perhaps the other food on the menu is a much safer bet when you're eating here. But if you're craving dim sum, DO NOT come here.", "author": "J K."}

We were wandering around and decided to eat here. The waitress/hostess was really friendly and there were a few people inside eating so we thought, why not? We ordered the Lobster with ginger and scallion and the combination chow mein. \n\nLobster:\nWe took a really long time to order, because we just didn't know what to get. I asked her if they had lobster and whether it was fresh, and she said yes, that it was fresh and in the basement. Whatever that means. And no, I didn't see it crawling around in the fish tank in front. Anyway, but we got it. It came out like three minutes later. Don't ask me how, because I have no idea how they cooked it so fast. And it was actually pretty good, the flavor that is. The lobster itself was pretty fresh, the only thing was the size - it was TINY! I swear that someone in the kitchen was eating the other half of our lobster. I pointed out to my husband that there was only one big claw, and that the other \"claw\" didn't really look like a claw. But whatever, it was good, and we were hungry, but we finished it in like five bites.\n\nChow mein:\nThis was okay, not very good, but not bad. Again, the portion was tiny. Plenty of meat and veggies, but hardly any noodle. \n\nSummary:\nThe flavor was good, service was quick, but we were still super hungry after we finished eating. It was kind of disappointing. The portions are really small. I'd rather they just charge a little more and give decent portions. I hate the feeling of wanting more after you've just went out to eat. Oh well. Will we return?

It was (under the prior owner) a mainstay throughout my childhood, and (under the current owner) remains a place I visit whenever I am in the city.  I am somewhat saddened by how poorly Bow Hon is reviewed.\n\nFirst, it helps if one brings their expectations inline with atmosphere.  PF Changs has very nice restrooms and readily accepts credit cards - but their food (while good in some respects) is absolutely unauthentic.  Bow Hon has gum stuck to the underside of tables, cheap decor, horrible bathrooms, and railings sticky to the touch leading to them (just like those found in China), it is staffed with, cooked by, and filled with ethnic Chinese.\n\nSecond, most reviewers are ordering the wrong dishes.  If you are thinking of ordering pot stickers, beef with broccoli, cashew chicken, a pu pu platter, fried rice, etc do yourself a favor and get it by the scoop somewhere.  Otherwise print the handy menu below and order a dish or two off it on your next visit as these I personally swear by:\n\n  crab with ginger and scallion.\n  clams in black bean sauce.\n  chin min (sp?) hong kong style (with seafood and vegetables).\n\n  Others which are less heavenly than the above but which are great in their own right:\n  steamed fish (ie sea bass)\n  salt and pepper prawns", "author": "Nalin S."}

The food there was so amazing that after I came back from SF three days I still couldn't forget how delicious the food was. I would highly recommend you visit this restaurant if you are looking for some authentic Chinese food. \n\nTaste of the food and authenticity ***** 5 stars\nMy top dishes are the following:\n\nThe 'Eggs and Pig Knuckles with Ginger and Vinegar' is the BEST! If you're willing to venture yourself to try something exotic rather than the regular Chinese food (fried rice, pork chop/ kung pao chicken, etc), you can try this dish and you'll be surprise! learn more abt this dish @http://bit.ly/99UKRZ This dish is really good for your health because it supply calcium and provide protein. \n\n2nd favorite dishes: Steam Chinese cabbage. \nTis dish is super well prepared which you have to allow 15-20 mins prep time. The cabbage is steamed in a bamboo steamer with a layer of foil paper at the bottom, and some minced pork and some green bell pepper on top, this combination made the dish taste terribly good. I've never tasted anything comes close to this. \n\nService **** 4 stars\nThe services was very  friendly and efficient. The waitress kept checking with us and let us know when will the food be ready which is very nice!\n\nPlace *** 3 stars \nVery basic and nothing fancy.

You can park at the chinatown parking garage which is one or two blocks down the street on 728 Pacific Avenue if you can't find any street parking.\n\nPrice (varies)\nTwo people order two main dishes about $25. For the taste of food it's really worth it!  \n\nAdditional Tips:\n\nThey serve dim sum all day long which is super nice if you're looking for some small Chinese dishes to eat.

I see some of the reviewers gave a lower rating because they ordered food like beef chow fun or fried tofu, but when you walk into a restaurant in Chinatown, you really need to know what to order depending on the restaurant.  The clay pot rice is the best in the Bay Area.  I would suggest anything with Chinese sausage or bacon.  Their taste goes right into the rice and really brings out its flavor.  Each clay pot comes with a dish of veggie, which I think is enough for a meal, since your main dish should be the clay pot rice anyways.  After the meal, they will make a delicious claypot rice soup for free.\n\nI am especially impressed by the service in this restaurant, compared to other Chinese restaurants.  Chinese restaurants are not known for friendly service, but the waitresses here I think are trained with an emphasis on being friendly.

The portion, while still small, is quite flavorful (the mushroom, chicken, and chinese sausage as my favorite), and it comes with a plate of veggies.

Like others have said, the 'clay pot dishes' like those with the tofu or beef brisket or duck and taro, etc etc are really kind of well, nasty...\n\nThe good stuff is the 'clay pot rice dishes' where the rice is cooked in a clay pot (rather than w/ a rice-cooker) with various types of meat inside. From what I can recall, you can get the clay pot rice w/ either spareribs or chicken and mushroom or frog or a combo clay pot rice with Chinese sausage + salted/dried duck + salted/dried pork. There are probably more varieties on the menu... bbbbuuut, in any case, the combo salted meats clay pot rice is the crowd favorite. The flavor of the meats is cooked into the rice and you get salted-meat-juice infused into the rice. Yum!  \n\nTip: Try to order in advance since it takes a while to cook the rice in the clay pot. Like someone else mentioned, after you finish the rice, they pour in green onions, cilantro and chicken broth and mix it up w/ the slightly charred rice on the bottom of the pot. Great after-meal treat.\n\nThe raw fish salad is pretty good too, although people seem to complain that there's not enough fish. IMHO, too much fish makes the dish unbalanced and not very good... Everywhere you get this dish the fish is not plentiful, that's the way it is - they'd charge an arm and a leg if they put in the amount of fish people are calling for.

We didn't expect that, so we were like \"she better not charge us for it.\" So when we were almost done,  that's when they brought over her water melon drink! The bill came out to almost 40 bucks. Totally not worth it, and we are not coming back here again.", "author": "Monina C."}

Bathroom, filthy, on the third floor of a sticky, gunky staircase and handrail. I know people rave about this place, but I have to say...my health is important to me and I wont risk it again in this dirty, filthy place. I went with a friend and both of us were suprised at the condition of the restaurant and the food that came. The food had obvious signs of mold and rot. We refused it and left. That they could even think that was okay to serve showed us their standerds.", "author": "linda j."}

It is stellar.  I'm inclined to agree about the rest of the menu...  don't remember anything worth ordering again except that salad...", "author": "K. M."}

I must say that it is difficult to read reviews written by other people on Yelp or other \"citizen reporter\" sites or books to know if you will like a place or not.  Hard to say.  I make at least one trip to Bow Hon every time I come to SF. My meal ends up to be pricey, and I walk out feeling like I've had a great meal, not a waste of money.  That said, I have only ordered particular things: the spiced salt shrimp has been fixed differently on different occasions but then I'm not sure how to order - the one I'm trying for is the one that comes out with the heads on, spicy, and red - last time it came out with some batter on it - not sure why it was different.  Sunde fish salad is excellent, okay, true, not so much fish, but I like the tastes of the peanuts, fish, cilantro, etc. mixed together.  Steamed fish balls were tasty.  I also just got hooked on the minced seafood with lettuce leaf wrap - I suspect there's little actual seafood and a lot of water chestnuts, but I had to go back to Bow Hon again for this on the same business trip.  As something of a reward for helping out with a cultural mis-communication between some French tourists and the hostess/manager, the locals to my left last week gave me a taste of their steamed egg custard with clams dish.  I have not ordered any \"standard large chinese restaurant\" dishes, and maybe that's why I'm thrilled with the place.  The stuff the French tourists were eating was all gloppy and did not look too terribly appetizing.", "author": "Andrea P."}
