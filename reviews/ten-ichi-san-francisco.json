I got a bad vibe immediately after walking in, as the maitre d' counter is at the back of the restaurant near the sushi bar, leaving people confused when they come in. While the restaurant was mostly full, there were maybe two wait staff for the entire place and after they seated me I sat for 10 minutes without seeing one.\n\nOur waitress was befuddled by my friend's honestly normal questions about sushi, such as which fishes were the freshest. Additionally, as some fish had multiple origins, the waitress should be able to address questions regarding the multiple types. Also, I'm guessing she was unfamiliar with sushi because when asked what the best order to eat them was, the answer was \"whatever order you want\". \n\nThe first 2-3 pages of the menu are devoted to non-sushi dishes so I'd say this place is likely more of a teriyaki or udon noodle place pretending to be a high end sushi restaurant. You can do a lot better for the same price.", "author": "Jordan C."}

The performance at the bar is much, much better. The people here are nice, the food is good, but they play games with the bill. On my most recent visit, they charged my card 50% more than the price that they displayed on the original check brought to me. When I asked about this, the waitress responsible for the charge had to verify the constituent pieces of the check with the rest of the staff. Now, you could chalk this up to human error, but during the course of my visit, two other patrons from completely separate parties also exclaimed quite loudly that they were mischarged. One of these patrons was in a party that was of just two individuals, where they were attempting to split the bill. One was charged the correct amount, and one was charged something completely incorrect, like not even a divisible factor of the orignal bill. I don't understand how you screw up a split bill for a party of two. Anyway, in trying to reason about my own billing error, I did notice that my check was written out in a way that was completely confusing. But I knew what I ordered, and so did the staff. There's definitely a problem with this piece of the business. Or not. They've been around for 40+ years. Now, on to the food. The soba noodles were pretty good. So were my two orders of sashimi. The fish was fresh, but not acquired day of. Serving sizes for fish were not great at all---for $16 you get two slivery slices of bluefin tuna. Okay. It's an expensive fish. But really, guys, that just smells bad (figuratively. The restaurant itself smells fine. There are gnats that fly around your food, but there is no fishy smell.) On to the seating experience. I sat at the bar. Very friendly and helpful staff, and friendly clientele. I liked that they bring you a wrapped-in-plastic warmed washcloth.

We sat for about 25 min nobody came over to greet us nor serve drinks. We had to came over to find the waitress cuz we were so hungry. After making the order, we waited for another 40 min or so, my husband came over to the waitress and asked for our food. The waitress served us a bowl of rice with beef, I asked her \"what is that? Was it the sukiyaki bowl (hot pot soup with vegetable, beef and noodles)?\" Because it looked nothing like that, when I ordered I even showed her the picture. She said without a blink of an eye\" it is! It's actually a different type of Sukiyaki\" As Sukiyaki is one of my favorite Japanese dishes that I order all the time, there's no way it is Sukiyaki. After eating half of it, I feel very frustrated I called the manager over and asked him what it is, the manager told me it's not Sukiyaki, I got super upset not because we are waiting for one hr for this meal, but it's that the waitress lied in front of us that she could just said that I'm sorry I made a mistake. Without doing that she tried to tell us that it's a \"different type\" of Sukiyaki!!!! Everyone will make mistake and it's not a big deal, but lying to clients it's not ok!! The most frustrating part was that on the bill, they still charged us the full price for Sukiyaki!!!! Which we didn't have! I asked the waitress why, she said \" look! If I made a mistake, you could have return it when I serve it to you, but now you are half of it so you need to pay\" I said \" first of all, this is not the dish we ordered and you lied right in front of us and let us try your \"different type\" of Sukiyaki , now we have to pay more for the dish that we never had?!\" What the waitress replied really astonished me, she said \" you don't need to pay me any tips, just pay the dish and leave\" That moment I did what she told me, I don't want to waste my time arguing with such type of waitress. She made all the guests feel so worthless, she ordered the wrong dish and lied to us and we all have to pay for it. On our way out, we met another couple outside who was seating right next to us, and told us \" we didn't pay any tips because my wife and I had this dish for 2 hrs, they missed one of our order when we asked her, she said \" do you need this now? \" my wife and I don't want to waste another hr, so we left\" worst restaurant experience ever!!!!", "author": "Keting S."}

Every chance I had to get someone's attention they are either on the phone taking orders, relay racing towards the kitchen, or taking orders at a table. I get it, you're under staffed but wouldn't you think being in a busy street you're in-making the money you're making, you hired more servers? Also my boyfriend got food poisoning from the under cooked chicken teriyaki, and we mention this to our server. It's hard to see when the whole restaurant is so damn dark and the taste of the chicken gave us the hint to stop eating! Sushi is expensive for the quality and quantity you are receiving. Come here if you want non existent service, oblivious to \"authentic Japanese food\", and enjoy being in cave. I'll skip and journey to Japan town.", "author": "Annie L."}

We had to request napkins + water at least 3-4 times..the soup was extremely over heated in plastic bowls with plastic spoons - the city of SF has even banned hot food packaged in plastic or styrofoam for being unhealthy. The better healthy concious spots serve hot food in glass or porcelain not cheapo plastic ware.Seriously, who really wants unhealthy pb's leeched from cheap plastic in their soup or food?!\n\nThe waiter smiled and was nice to the tables around us however every time he approached our table we got the mean, rude, dirty looks  from him. When we requested water, a soup spoon or anything he was so rude and gave us such ugly looks. it was obvious he did not appreciate us at his table! On the way to the washroom, I had to pass the same waiter..he gave me the rudest  looks again..my friend noticed at the table too! He mentioned to me, maybe it was a language barrier??\n\nhonestly we have never experienced rude service before at any restaurant or bar or venue in the city...this is such a great neighborhood and community, everyone is so nice - this was so surprising and atypical of the neighborhood community we know and love. Our groups of friends work, live and play all around the neighborhood, everyone agrees it is very awsom here.\n\nSince we receive rockstar and friendly service all over the neighborhood and are friends with the staffs at pretty much all the other top spots in the neighborhood, we were quite surprised.\n\nWe will never eat here again. There are so many awsom sushi spots around the city, we did not appreciate our rude service and bad vibes with our mediocre sushi. The food was not awful, it was average....there are many fantastic options around pac heights..Out the Door down the street is mindblowing every time and they are nice!.\n\nIn a nutshell - Very Unpleasant experience while out to enjoy some holiday cheer! Really bad vibe from the waiter. It soured the taste of the mediocre sushi. You can do So Much Better in the city, the standards are so high here there are so many awsom sushi spots. We love a nearby sushi spot on 6th and California..also Blowfish is fantastic.  Live Sushi SOMA is another good one!", "author": "T Maria L."}

I'll call it an off night, and it won't stop me from ordering again from you- but it will put you on probation for sure.  My take out order, while accurate, was assembled in a bit of a lack-luster manner.  The one roll I ordered- an 'All American' roll, was quite nice, but the cuts of nigiri didn't look 'as expected', and were sloppily assembled.  Worst off- my toro was unacceptable- skunky in taste and smell, cut poorly, and with an inedible/ unchewable vein-like tendon comprising the length of the cut and 1/4 of the mass.  For what you charge, the toro should be the 'most perfect' piece in the order, and not a cast-off like this.  I had to do a double-take because it didn't look like anything I had ever received from you previously- I thought it looked like a clam or something but it definitely wasn't.\n\nI've been a fan of your restaurant for a long time, ordering 8-12 times a year- almost all take-out with an occasional stop at the sushi bar. This was the weakest execution yet.  I'll call it an off-night, and hope that things go back to my expectations next time.

I enjoyed my food, but I was very displeased with the service. \n\nWe were seated pretty quickly during prime time on a Friday (wait was only 10min, which is great for our neighborhood). But alas, although the crowd in the restaurant was beginning to wane, we still had to wait 15 minutes or maybe more for the waitress to take our order. That was probably the only true lapse in service, but be aware that if you're coming here, you're in for a \"relaxed\" dining experience. It only they would immediately take a drink order and follow up a few minutes later with the food order, the relaxed pace might actually be welcomed. \n\nMy wife and I shared the Veggie Bento and the Veggie Sukiyaki. I also had the Spicy Scallop roll. We both had Sapporo on tap. \n\nThe Veggie Bento is huge. You get a cold noodle salad and miso soup to start, and the bento itself has tempura veggies, agedashi fried tofu, eggplant and tofu in sauce, and 4 pieces of a mixed vegetable roll. Rice was included. I enjoyed all the elements of this entree, although nothing stood out as particulary \"awesome.\" \n\nThe veggie sukiyaki was tasty. I'm not sure if it was \"good\" compared to other sukiyakis, because this is the first time I've ever had this kind of dish. That said, again, I enjoyed it. It came with a miso soup for starters, and was also accompanied by rice. The broth was sweet but not overbearing, and it was chock full of vegetables (though mostly cabbage). I thought there would be more noodles in the dish, but I'm not sure what is normal, so I don't want to complain. \n\nHowever, I was disappointed by the Spicy Scallop roll. This is the 'testpiece' I order at all sushi restaurants, so I know how to compare it. It wasn't spicy and the scallop wasn't particularly flavorful. Also, it was $8, but you only got 4 pieces. I'm used to a roll being at least 6 pieces, so that was disappointing. \n\nI will likely be back, but probably only for the cooked dishes, not the sushi.", "author": "Allison S."}

I've ordered the sushi rolls at least once before but I don't even remember the taste of it because the price sticks out in my mind. They are a pricey sushi restaurant, but their lunch specials are fairly reasonable.  I usually order the same thing which is always the salmon teriyaki and the chicken karage or the shrimp tempura. You can't go wrong with those. The service is quick and friendly and you never wait long for a table.", "author": "Sharon B."}

I was starving and was craving for Japanese food so my husband and I stopped by Ten-Ichi since it was the closest Japanese restaurant to my dr.'s office.  \n\nWe were greeted immediately after entering the restaurant and the host mentioned we can sit anywhere we would like since there were only 2 other patrons there.  We decided to sit right next to their aquarium since it was freezing outside and we didn't want to be too close to the window/doors. \n\nSince I can't order sushi with my preggers self, I opted for one of their bento boxes which was a bit on the pricier side for lunch.   But it was fresh and still very delicious!  My husband ordered a healthy chicken dish for lunch and enjoyed it as well.  Our total came out to $26 without tip so it wasn't too bad.  I can't wait to return to try their sushi. \n\nThey provided excellent service so I will definitely return.", "author": "Christine P."}

Period. :) haha no that would be a lame review. \n\nTruth is...you can't find a better place for a feel good, happy home, delicious sushi spot in the Bay. You walk in and feel cozy, but also know there's some good food to be had. I hear they're revamping their restaurant to make it even more awesome. Sounds good to me!\nI love the family who own Ten-Ichi..they make you feel welcome and want you to just be happy. Thanks Ten-Ichi because as easy as it sounds, so many people do it wrong. You all deserve a wink and a smile.\n\nWe've all had sushi rolls and yes they can all be good, but Ten-Ichi managed to not only make sushi rolls that taste AMAZING, but fresh, clean, and something new! The American Dream Roll..yeah..you have to go there.  Really all of their 5-10 rolls I tried there ROCK!! :) Sashimi..a true test of freshness..and yes..they can do it. \n\nIn addition, they just do traditional Japanese well with some small plates to feed your taste for a variety of food and possibly save you some money to keep in your pocket. But let's face it, you don't want to keep your money in your wallet when there's so much good stuff to be eaten. But you'll also be happily surprised with the decent costs of everything here. I know this sounds silly, but don't leave without some dessert. Pear, Mango, or Green Tea Ice cream topped with some fresh strawberries is such a sweet touch. And just perfect after a belly of yummy sushi. \n\nOverall..I can see Ten-Ichi being a place i visit over and over again for years to come. Because I know I could have my favs, but always trust to try something new and fabulous. :) They've been around for 30+ years..it definitely shows in their fOod, ambience, and welcoming good vibes. :) Love it.", "author": "Bernice L."}

It's close to where we work (2 blocks away) and so when we are craving Japanese, we order from here. Usually, someone else picks up for us so we don't know what the wait is like but the most recent time, we went to pick up by ourselves. We were not acknowledged for at least 5 minutes, maybe more. We were standing right by the register and the waiter and waitress walked by at least 10 times. For good service, I expect them to at least ask us what we want. They had no idea if we were there to pick up food, order, or anything! Finally, we got their attention to tell them that we are here to pick up take out. The man apologized and said they were busy (although the restaurant wasn't full), which is fine. I just want to know that you know I'm there and why I'm there. I also want to note that we were told to pick up in 25 minutes and it took about 35 minutes so be aware of that if you are ordering during your lunch hour. \n\nI got chicken katsu and gyoza for lunch. I would not suggest getting the bento box because I didn't like the tempura nor the California roll that they gave me last time. I don't like the veggies they include in the tempura and my coworkers usually just get shrimp tempura but not veggies too. The California roll last time was smooched and did not look good at all. I understand it was take out but it didn't taste good either. It didn't taste too fresh. As for the gyoza, it was a steamed kind. It was good enough but we didn't get a lot of gyoza sauce. I also didn't get enough chicken katsu sauce for my chicken katsu unfortunately :( The chicken katsu isn't bad though. They actually salt the chicken before frying so you can taste the saltiness. \n\nThis place is also kind of expensive. For lunch for 4 people, we paid a little over $100.

We watched as people who arrived after us get their meal, pay and leave. We watched numerous to-go order leave the bar. We continued to wait. The waitress looked at us apologetically several times. We knew something about the service wasn't right and so did she.  Another 30 minutes and finally one of two rolls finally came out. Sad to say it didn't look appetizing. By then it was an 1 hour into our wait and we had prior engagements which couldn't be delayed by terrible service. Upon inquiring about our second dish we were rudely informed with, \"Dude, you have to wait\" by the man behind the counter.  Wow really?!? This is how you will address your customers? Terms such as \"Dude?\", not acceptable.  This unapologetic, superior tone from the man behind the counter was beyond disrespectful. Your staff treat the customers with respect and kindness only to be marred by the man behind the counters terrible attitude. Shouldn't call yourself a sushi chef.  \n\nNo one needs to be treated like that. We have respect for ourselves so we opted to get our check, forgo the last dish, choose not to eat dinner and leave.

The solid ones are almost the toughest ones to find because you expect a certain level of consistent fish and that can be really tough with sushi in my experience.\n\nYou've got to give props to any family owned restaurant that has been around for years and years. Moreover these people are just really nice. Any one of the reviews below that talk about bad service miss the point: These waiters are really nice people. If the service is bad, it's generally because they are slammed or just a little flustered--and that is \"bad\" service I can live with.\n\nTheir rolls are very good. Not insanely inventive like Blowfish or Tsunami but still really nice.\n\nAnd as for people who say there are other places in the neighborhood to go, I don't know what they are talking about.

We felt it was too expensive for what we got. Especially when you have Godzilla sushi right around the corner on Divisadero and Bush... why would you ever waste $10+ for a 4 piece specialty roll?  At least they drizzled some sauce around the plate for that cheesy artistic look.\n\nI tried to send my specialty eel roll back because the grilled eel (listed as the first ingredient) was nowhere to be found.  The waitress and sushi chef laughed at me and said I had to eat it and that they had made it correctly.  My friend ordered a tuna cut roll, and the rolls were soooo small.  One even had a small pinch of fish in it, and she tried to send it back saying that she paid for sushi, not seaweed wrapped rice... and the waitress also refused to take it back.\n\nWe had a good appetizer of 3 different types of seaweed salad.

I ordered the Chirashi which was very good, the fish was fresh and a pretty good portion for $20. Where I felt was lacking was in the chicken and beef teriyaki that my friends ordered. The chicken tasted a little bit funny, not sure what the taste was but all of us at the table agreed. Service is friendly and the atmosphere is nice but I just couldn't get over the funny tasting chicken teriyaki.\n\nI would say come here to order their specialty rolls and sushi, but stay away from the beef and chicken teriyaki.", "author": "Matt K."}

We both love this place.  But agree it's perhaps a little overpriced for what you get.  Then again, not many Japanese restaurants are actually owned and operated by Japanese people these days.  This one is, and it's food reflects that authenticity.  I don't mind paying more for good food.\n\nI recommend sitting at the sushi bar which is at the back of the restaurant.  You might as well get the full show.  A little miso, a little iron chef ... all in all a good night.\n\nFOR CHEAP BUT GOOD JAPANESE FOOD go to Kitaro on Geary.

Please, Ten-ichi, become the sushi restaurant Fillmore Street so desperately needs (think Elephant or Okoze in Russian Hill).  The sushi rolls have very little fish actually in them which is so annoying given the price - they're all rice and seaweed wrap ... unlike any other place I've gone to in the area (Godzilla, Tataki, etc).  The nigiri comes slathered with a slimy wasabi on top of it - hate it.  I couldn't get over how high my bill was on my last two visits given the lack of fish in the rolls (I tried a traditional roll AND a hand-roll because I was stunned by the lack of fish in the first roll I ordered).  I almost sent the rolls back but I never send food back because it feels so weird.  Looking back, I really wish I had because I feel taken advantage of.  Instead this review will be my feedback.

I especially like that their menu is fairly large and varied, and that their food is fresh.  Most things that I have had on the menu are very good.  Stand-out are their home-smoked salmon, the variety in their chirashi, and the green bean and chicken saute.", "author": "J M."}

That was really what made us try it, in spite of the fact a friend said she hated it!  The fish was super fresh and hands down, it was the best salmon I have in since moving to San Francisco almost a year ago.  Three of us shared about 4 rolls and 3 orders of nigiri while my vegetarian girlfriend had a delicious sake and soy sauce flavored tofu and vegetable plate.  The service was fast and friendly and the bill was only $100 (including two bottles of sake) for four people total.  I would defnitely go there again and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.", "author": "J L."}

I wasn't very hungry so i ordered one of my favorite appetizer dishes, the tempura.  It came piping hot, crispy and very delicious! The sauce i think even had bits of mashed up ginger.  We shared a dish of sashimi, a bit pricey for the 3 thin slices of the hamachi and 3 square pieces of the tuna, but the sashimi itself was delicious. Very good quality fish.   We also ordered a philadelphia roll, i don't usually like cream cheese in my rolls, but this was pretty tasty. not too much.", "author": "Lulu C."}

I also got a couple orders of nigiri.  The fish was fresh and even though I got take out I was given some tea to sip on while they were preparing my order.

Their sushi is very fresh and made \"american syle\" meaning lots of creative maki's and different sauces. All of their food is consistent and ample in portions. The one dish that stands out above all the rest is their Chicken Karaage. Every Japanese restaurant I've been to from as far south in San Jose to San Francisco, Ten-ichi's Karaage stands out above all the rest. Just try it! I promise you'll agree! Overall, the quality of the food is excellent, the service very good, and the ambiance very comfortable. The Fillmore is lucky to have this establishment in the neighborhood.", "author": "M V."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-08-27", "description": "Maybe we were there on an off night, or maybe you have to order the cooked food, but we found this place to be mediocre at best.  We ordered all sushi--tuna (maguro) , yellowtail (hamachi), salmon (sake), monkfish liver (?), and mackerel (saba)--and only the mackerel was decent.  The rest was barely okay.  It was either bad cuts, or unskilled selection by the chef.  I think the rice had too much sugar, too, which drowns out the flavor and consistency of the fish.\nWhen we try out a new sushi place, we generally order a round, and then order another round of what was good.  We didn't order another round.  It was that bad.  We left hungry and picked up something small at Thai Stick.\nThe service was fine.  The atmosphere was okay.  Overall, I would say there are much better places in the area.", "author": "Jason T."}

The sushi is fresh and if when I can't decide what to eat, I sit at the sushi bar and the friendly chefs can make suggestions or create something unique for me to eat. I've eaten here several times now and can recommend almost everything on the menu from the agedashi tofu to the beef negimiyaki. They have the standard tempura, teriyaki dishes, and homestyle yummies like sukiyaki which are all delicious!  In addition though, their menu is imaginative and fun with things like their crunchy roll and tuna carpacio.  I also love their chicken karaage. Just remember with all this good stuff, to leave room for sushi!  Oh and if you wnjoy a cold brew of Kirin straight off the tap and into a frosted glass, this is the place to go!\n\nThis restaurant has been family owned for more than 25 years... you can often find the owner's around for a little chat. The service is friendly and the decor clean, pleasant and uncluttered. This is also a place great for children, who I've seen there many times... especially hanging around the beautiful fish tank.  I've taken many family and friends here and would have no problem recommending Ten Ichi to any lover of Japanese food.", "author": "Christine H."}

The fish is fresh, the chefs and waitstaff are friendly, and the atmosphere is relaxed.

I would say that the sushi may not be exotic, but it is very tasty and the service excellent (especially the owner and her daughter have taken the time out to acknowledge my wife and me). The sushi chef there when we first started going was a very pleasant Japanese fellow who was working on his country western guitar playing. We like'd sitting at the bar drinking cold saki, (declasse'?) and enjoying the banter about us. The prices are not out of line with what you pay elsewhere, but parking sucks. Fillmore street is steadily getting more and more chi chi, so go before all the shops are too expensive.

As a custom in Japan, we will ask the sushi chef to drink with us when the food is great. They reluntantly took a few drinks from us. haha~ Everyone was friendly, from the chefs, to the owner, and his wife. That was great food and great fun.
