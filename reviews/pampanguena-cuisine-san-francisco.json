I'll admit I was a tiny bit hesitant due to some of the poor quality food pictures on Yelp, but once diving in to our fantastic 10 person Kamayan dinner, I was sold. Everything was cooked to perfection and seemingly easy for them. Both baskets of our food came out within a minute of each other and were filled with seafood, meats, veggies, rice, and sauces. This place popped to the top of my favorite Bay Area restaurants immediately. \n\nOh also something that might be helpful- you can get a 2 person Kamayan style dinner.

Spots like this make San Francisco beautiful. Some old timers claim the city isn't what it was. Guess what, it still is. Come check it out. This is the city. It's in here.\n\n+ Chicken Adobo - I liked this a lot! Everything browned in oil and I guess a little garlic and then I put it over the great garlic rice, dang, it's awesome. The meat cooked to the point it's falling off the bone and all the other ingredients soaking up the meat flavor. This was a great dish. We'll get this again. \n+ Sisig Baboy - Marinated and Grilled Pork - Excellent! It comes out on a hot skillet so it has a minute to caramelize and just wow. Get this! I was worried that it would be too hot with the peppers but it's not at all too hot. Actually just enough green stuff to mellow out all the fried stuff. The vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic mix are simply amazing. \n+ Lumpiang Shanghai - These are so good they are dangerous. If you get an order, which I highly suggest you do, be careful. They are tasty and crunchy and if dipped in the sauce, sweet and satisfying. With a sip of juice (see below) magic in your mouth! \n+ Calmansi Juice - This is the first time I'd ever had this beverage. They don't have fountain soda so I asked for a house made juice. Before the meal arrived I thought it was too sweet however with dinner it's perfect. \n\nAs we walked out, we thanked them for their great dinner. The reply, \"Thank you, tell your friends.\" I don't know if it was our server or one of the twenty something's that just took a table. That's what I'm doing. Come here. Bring your friends. The Bay area has a huge Filipino population so I'd assume we'd have a lot of great choices - but we don't.  Everybody needs to try this spot at least once. Get in here. The prices are great and food amazing.\n\nYou'll see us here again but with our friends next time.\n\nCredit Card welcomed.  They gladly take Visa, MasterCard and Debit.

An order of this comes as a huge spread of food on banana leaves: centered around scoops of white rice are a selection of grilled and fried dishes that are simply delicious. The lumpia were nice and crispy, the preserved egg added a perfect touch of salty flavor, and the grilled squid, chicken, fried fish, and marinated pork were all so flavorful in their own way! The fried shrimp were so crispy that you could just bite right through and eat the shell, and the broccoli, eggplant, and mango/onion/tomato \"salsa\" were nice and refreshing. On the side came four different types of sauces, and the staff took the time to explain to us which sauces went best with which dishes! In addition to the kamayan, we also had an order of the kare kare, an oxtail peanut-based curry with a bunch of veggies, including Shanghai bok choy, eggplan, and string beans. The curry was thick, gooey, and full of flavor. \n\nYou really can't beat the value for the food you get here.

You better prepare those salivary glands for take-off because this is gonna be one delicious @ss flight! This deal is really incredible! A full feast that will happily satisfy at least 6 people for less than $20 bucks a person! You know I'm all in! So, let's break it on down with the list of included food items:\n\nKamayan Animan (Feeds 6 guests for $68.95):\n-Chicken and Pork BBQ\n-Grilled tilapia \n-Grilled squid\n-Grilled Pork\n-Flitter shrimp\n-Salted egg \n-Lumpia\n-Mango/tomato/onion \n-Sweet yam \n-Steamed white rice \n-Steamed vegetables\n-Steamed eggplant \n\nIn addition to this, our party of 8 also ordered:\n-Sizzling Sisig baboy (grilled marinated pork)\n-Lechon Kawali (crispy fried pork belly)\n-Pancit Bihon (stir fried noodles)\n-Halo halo\n\nI'm gonna go right ahead and proclaim the sizzling sisig and the crispy lechon as the stars of this show! That sisig came out sizzling and it was sangin' a lullaby to me! It was juicy, flavorful, and marinated to perfection! But that pork belly though! OMG! That lechon was on fiyaaaaahhh! The crispy bake on the outside was PERF! Mixed with the tenderness of the inside... just melting on my tongue like whaaaaa?! You would have thought a girl had died after eatin' that! It was just sooo dayum GOOD! Mmm mmm MMM! \n\nMoving on to the other standouts: the crispy lumpia, the perfectly grilled tilapia, the fresh mango, tomatoes, and onions, the delightful BBQ chicken, and the perfectly sweet halo halo. I mean, THIS meal was like the meal from God! Somebody please please pleeeaase let THIS meal be my last one on earth because I will gladly accept it in a heartbeat!\n\nIf I had to nitpick, I would just say that the salted egg was just a bit too salty for me! I'm also not feeling the fact that this place is cash only, but I digress. Of course I can always say that I would have loved to have more food on the plate because there was NO food left behind here, kids! Portions sizes are ample and the prices are pretty damn cheap for what you get! My friend ordered 100 lumpias for take home for only $30 which is really a steal!\n\nThe place is pretty tiny with limited seating for large groups and it's pretty much first come first serve. The service was great and they were able to accommodate all of our picky little needs. They really handled our large group well and cooperated with us. The owner was super sweet and she came out to greet us and to check in on us several times during our stay.

We chowed down hands first (minus the sinigang soup), and were pretty full afterwards! The animan was definitely enough for a group of 6 or 7, but with a large group, add on to the order!\n\nWe were given plate baskets lined with banana leaves, and dipping sauces for the various \"ulam\" in the kamayan meal. All the grilled meats were so yummy, as well as the lumpia, fish, and squid! The sisig, sinigang, and pancit were also cooked just like it came from mama's or lola's kitchen, so you know the quality of the meals is worth it.\n\nSarap!!", "author": "Mary F."}

Family-owned small restaurant, always support small businesses.  Doesn't hurt that I also love Filipino food so much.  This place is way better than Pampalasa, I paid over $50 for a Kamayan style dinner at Pampalasa, supporting a friend's last-ditch effort to save an overpriced Filipino restaurant in SOMA.  It was definitely high-end Kamayan feast dinners.  When my Filipino friends told me Pampalasa was overpriced for Kamayan, I knew I had spent way too much $$$ aka sucker!  Needless to say, the restaurant closed.  \n\nLittle did I know there's this hidden gem of Filipino cuisine in the Excelsior District!  The staff are super friendly and attentive.  Josie the mom/cook is so awesome.  The ambiance is cozy and small, feels like eating with family once you start grubbin'.\n\nOur Kamayan dinner consisted of the following:\n\n- Lumpias\n- Meat\n- Shrimp\n- Fish\n- Calamari\n- Salty eggs\n- Eggplant\n- Rice\n- Broccoli\n- Mango\n- Sweet yams \n \nWe ordered a la carte sizzing sisig, lechon, pancit, and halo-halo for dessert.

He sees it all over our friends & family's social media and was curious. In comes Pampangue\u00f1a. \n\nThe place is quaint and the decor reminiscent of restaurants from back home; lots of sea creatures and bamboo. We ordered the kamayan for 2 and a BBQ plate for the kids. From the mass of food from photos I've seen, I expected to have to wait a length of time and longingly looked at the food arriving at other tables so I was pleasantly surprised with how quick our order came. The \"dalawahan\" came with pork & chicken bbq, lumpiang shanghai, fried fish, rice (duh!), itlog na maalat and so very delicious mangoes, tomatoes & onions WITH a side of bagoong served on a banana leaf. It has been a point of conversation between the hubz and I how there is no \"fancy\" Filipino restaurant because our food isn't about pretty but all about taste. We're \"jungle\" Asians. Our food is typically served crammed in styro or slopped on a plate. Filipino food served on a banana leaf is possibly the \"sexiest\" way our food can be plated. Pampangue\u00f1a hits the mark on making our food pretty AND delicious. \n\nAs food coma was about to set in, our server asked if we were interested in turon or halo halo. Both please. \n\nAfter our gluttony had transpired, en route to wash our hands from the kamayan, the owner(?) yells \"I JUST MADE SOME FRESH LUMPIA, DO YOU WANT SOME?\" ... well sh*t. \"Yes ate, I'll take two!\" \n\nTL:DR- Partook in serious feasting and couldn't stop eating. \n\nWe'll definitely be back!", "author": "Meryl Q."}

So forget about flexibility nor customer service, this restaurant doesn't have it. Oh... The son of the owner was trying but the mom, perhaps the owner or manage, didn't have customer service in her DNA.\nMORE DOWNSIDE: I understand not accepting Amex for payment. I understand extra charge for using credit card. What I doing understand is not being able to provide an official receipt!!! I asked for one and the mom/manager rudely tells me THAT IS YOUR RECEIPT! uhm.. It was one of those scratch-like sales order... No tax id number whatsoever. So yeah...

I've gone to this restaurant several times over the years and, except for the turon, have yet to find a dish that I trusty love and crave.  \n\nThe kamayan dishes are presented beautifully and are a feast for the eyes but just tastes ok.   Whenever I have a friend that likes to photograph their food, I will usually bring them here because they will usually enjoy the place based on visuals alone despite the so-so taste.  I love their coconut juice which is also beautifully presented.   But, again, I only get these foods for the photographs and not really for the taste. \n\nEverything else that Ive tried so far is below average.  The making of the halo-halo is usually inconsistent but usually below average.   I once ordered the pork sisig to go and was horribly disappointed since it tasted funny.  I ended up throwing it away, uneaten.  \n\nThe only thing that I crave from this restaurant is the turon (fried plantain desert).   The crispy caramelization of the outer wrapping coupled with the sweet plantain inside is just heavenly!   It's usually pre-fried and ready to go near their cash register so makes an easy grab and go dessert.  If you're ever in the mood for something sweet and yummy while in the area, you must drop by and try their plantain.  \n\nOverall, I rate the place as 3 stars since nothing, other than the taste of the turon and the visual appeal of their kamayan dishes and coconut drink, really stands out here.", "author": "Linda H."}

These people all very top-notch Yelpers who take their eating and writing about it seriously. We have been wanting to try a traditional Kamayan meal for a long time and now the time was right. They don't take reservations at Pampanguena you just have to wait for a table. After finding out that Pampanguena Cuisine serves a Kamayan meal for six people for only $68.95 I was sold. With the \"Animan meal\" you get Chicken or Pork Barbeque, Grilled Tilapia, Grilled Squid, Grilled Pork, Flitter Shrimp (which are deep fried shrimp in panko crumbs), Lumpias (Lumpiang Shanghai as they call them), Salted Egg, chopped up Mango, Tomato, Onion, Sweet Yams, three huge bowl-filled scoops of white rice, Steamed Broccoli and Eggplant. Served on a movable tray on top of that banana leaf, it was feast fit for a king. Most of food we tried was excellent, including the lumpias which were a crispy golden brown that paired nicely with the Vietnamese Sweet Chili Oil dipping sauce, the deep fried shrimp were fresh from the fryer, the pork was nicely seasoned, and the veggies were steamed warm, the tilapia was a little too salty even with the vinegar that you pair it with, and the squid was a little too overcooked and therefore a little tough. I loved the salted eggs (oddly enough because I thought they'd be too salty but they weren't for me) as it provided a nice balance with the diced mangoes, tomatoes and yams.\n\nThere was so much food all eight of us could have eaten this huge tray of food and been satisfied. But since we were here we had to try some of the staples of Filipino cuisine, like the Pancit Bihon which is rice stick noodles sauteed with chicken, celery, carrots and onions. I liked but didn't love this dish as it lacked in a little flavor for me. We also ordered the Sisig Baboy which had marinated grilled diced pork topped with chopped onion and jalapeno served on a sizzling skillet. The Lechon Kawali which is deep fried pork belly was fried to perfection and was accompanied by a special dipping sauce. And since our meal couldn't be complete without the traditional Halo Halo with shaved ice, scoops of ume ice cream, condensed milk and sweet beans. It was so weather was so hot around us that the ice literally melted before our eyes, but it still was a unique treat for me.\n\nIn the end, our bill literally came to twenty dollars a person, which for a meal for eight people was a real steal. One of my dining mates even inquired about how much they sold a batch of freshly deep fried lumpias for and managed to make a deal for a hundred lumpias to-go for only thirty dollars! Yet another example of a dining deal in a somewhat unkempt area of town. They only take cash, and they don't have their liquor license, so no booze to go with your large meal. But I'll be back with family members so they themselves can try for the first time the unique dishes of the Philippines at Pampanguena Cuisine.", "author": "Jason F."}

I wasn't a big fan of the tamarind based soup which I found a bit too sour for my taste.

I grew up admiring Kapangpangans for their relationship with food and passion for cooking. \n\nThe BBQ for six \"kamayan\" style is awesome.  It's a medley of grilled meats and seafood served on a banana leaf, meant to be eaten without utensils by everyone.   I especially enjoyed the squid, perfectly tender and not overly seasoned.  Very healthy portions (well, \"healthy\" as in generous not \"healthy\" as in healthy.  It's Filipino food, c'mon).\n\nA few downgrades, not really about the food.  The restaurant is cold inside.

I read from other reviews it's a mom and pop restaurant not too far from my house. It's a small restaurant with street parking and it is cash only. I met the owner and her daughter and they were so nice.  Their menu is pretty extensive with beef and pork dishes, seafood and soups. I was torn between the pork adobo and sinagang ng baboy which is a tamarind based broth. The owner herself recommended the sinagang so I went with that and I was surprised that it was a huge bowl for sharing. The broth was very tasty and you could taste the tamarind in it. It had chunks of broccoli, baboy, and some peppers in it. I definitely made 3 meals out of it. I also noticed the table by me had a spread on their table with palm leaves and their food wasnt on plates but on the palm leaves itself. She recommended me trying that next time, but I'll definitely need to share with my family since they are family size portions. All in all I'll definitely be back especially to try the pork adobo next!", "author": "Dianne E."}

It's one of those family businesses that you cheer on because they are so warm to you. The service really made my day because they serve everything with a smile and welcome you to their restaurant like family! \n\nWe ordered the family style meal for 2 (split between 3). It came with grilled fish, two piping hot bowls of rice, salted eggs that you mix with a mango/tomato/onion salad, lumpia, grilled pork, chicken, vegetables (I think I have it all?). Although to be completely honest, I don't think the Filipino food is up my alley, I do think if you enjoy it a lot, you would love the food here! \n\nAlso, the place is super kitschy and cute.

The server told us they had been swamped up till then and that we came at a good time, so we got lucky!\n\nOrdering food here was the simplest thing ever. We opened the menu, agreed on getting the 3 person platter, and that was that! I love how quick and painless it is here. Yes there are appetizers and entrees you can order a la carte, but since it was our first time here we wanted to get the platters that this place is known for.\n\nOn the platter there was:\n\nLumpia: the fried lumpia rolls were solid. There was enough for 2/3 per person\n\nFried shrimp: it wasn't as crispy as it could be but it had good flavor\n\nBBQ chicken (or pork): the chicken was kind of fatty but other than that it was good\n\nFried fish: it's so interesting that they serve the whole fish fried. It was kind of hard to eat since it came with all the bones and I didn't have chopsticks to pick out some of the bigger bones (had to resort to using my hand instead), but other than that it was fine\n\nGrilled pork: this wasn't my favorite as it felt just a little bit tough to eat, but there was a lot of flavor\n\nGrilled squid: surprisingly good given that I don't like squid that much. It was on the salty side but this might have been my favorite meat on the platter\n\nSalted eggs: these taste exactly like the salted eggs I grew up eating at home. I haven't had one of these in a looooong time so I was really happy the platter had them. To be fair, it was super salty so I had to eat a ton of rice with it, especially with the egg white, but it brought back many happy memories of eating them with my parents.\n\nSteamed veggies: these were all kind of bland. I ate a couple pieces of the broccoli but didn't touch the eggplant or the okra\n\nRice: there was soooooo much white rice on the platter, portion-wise definitely more than a bowl per person. Good thing we were all pretty hungry!\n\nAt the end they gave us some sweet potatoes in a sweet syrup as dessert on the house. These were pretty good, but at this point I was pretty darn full so I only tried a piece or two.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the food and appreciated how much rice we were given to eat with everything. We demolished everything and only some of the veggies were left at the end, so if you come in hungry you can definitely finish the whole thing!\n\nThe food is 4 stars, and my last star is for the service. I loved our server who was really nice. I pointed out an oil stain on the table from the previous patrons, and he came over and scrubbed very furiously at the spot and apologized really nicely for missing the spot when he was wiping down the table earlier.\n\nParking is a pain in this area, watch out. I circled around for 5-10 minutes before I got lucky and saw this tiny street parking spot a block away from the restaurant. Definitely carpool if you are planning to come here with friends! I'm so glad we did.\n\nOur total came out to $17 pp after tax and tip.", "author": "Dianna H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-23", "description": "Hella food. \n\nSo this Filipino restaurant was featured on YELP for an ROTD review and I quickly bookmarked the place. I was checking their photos and I began to salivate as I scrolled through them and I finagled the Wifey into eating here a week later on typical cool and foggy San Francisco day. It was a just before lunch time on a Saturday and parking along Mission Street is always a challenge, but we managed to find a spot across the street. \n\nFirst impression of the place was a typical Filipino joint with decorations that is fitting more for a seafood restaurant with a nautical theme of fish, lobsters, seahorse, dolphins, crabs and anchors adorning the walls. I don't know where they got these from, but it seems like they got them from a yard sale and just hung them up for decorations and they looked out of place against the bamboos and tropical thatch shingles that are more appropriate decorations, IMHO. However, nothing screams Filipino like Karaoke and they definitely had that. \n\nOK, we weren't here for the decorations and we were here to order their \"Kamayan Style\" dishes and they did not disappoint. We ordered the \"Tatlohan\" for three people and sat back and enjoyed looking at the other patrons' orders as they were delivered to their tables as the Kamayan was the popular way to go. Kamayan means to eat with your hands, and you certainly had that option as there is a sink just in front of the counter for you to wash your hands if you choose to do so, but they also offered utensils for those who didn't want to go commando. Hey, eating with your hands is one of the most natural things there is in this world. \n\nUpon receiving ours on a bed of beautiful banana leaf covered straw platter, I had to quickly take a photo and marvel at what was in front of us: A cornucopia of different types of Filipino food that was well balanced from different textures ranging from crunchy, crispy and chewy to flavors from savory, tangy, salty and sweet. We dug in like hungry teenagers just coming home from school and left no evidence behind that such a scene was committed. In other words, you won't be leaving hungry and be prepared for leftovers if you're a light eater. \n\nI also have to give props to the service since it was definitely exceptional. I don't know if he owns the place, but they guy with the mustache was one of the friendliest and happiest person I have ever met working in a restaurant as he surely made it an enjoyable experience. \n\nLike General Douglas MacArthur said to the Philippines during WWII, \"I shall return.\"", "author": "John G."}

Most of the parking is metered so be prepared to bring quarters or have a card on hand for the machines.\n\nWhen you walk inside you see the seating to your left. There will probably be someone near the entrance as well to seat you and/or give you a menu as well. The servers here are very polite and gracious. They really seem to go out of their way to make sure you are attended to you. For that, I am very appreciative. \n\nAfter being seated I received a menu and everything looked amazing. They have a lot to choose from but I tend to be very consistent with what I like to eat at Filipino restaurant. Usually  I get adobo and bistek but today I decided to change it up!!! I decided to go with the Kaldereta and the sisig. It has been a long time since I last had either and figured why not be adventurous here, especially since the reviews are so good. Of course I had to get some lumpia as well because what would a Filipino meal be without lumpia!\n\nAfter placing the order I waited patiently. As expected, there was a TV with Filipino broadcasting on, TFC (Sometimes you'll see GMA but that tends to be rare). This place wasn't too busy either. There was only one other group here when I arrived so I figured it would get busy later on. \n\nBe advised that this is a CASH only business so keep that in mind. There is an ATM located inside but it is currently not working so you will most likely have to go to the liquor store at the corner to get cash or stop by the bank before coming here. \n\nIn regards to the food, everything tasted great. The lumpia was good. I liked that I could get a lot of pieces for so cheap. The sisig was OK but it seemed like there was more fat than meat but maybe I just being picky. The Kaldereta alright but it seemed like they might have put a lot of ketchup an tomato sauce in it to make it taste more flavorful. I did however like the peppers that they put in the Kaldereta, nice big pieces making it spicy!\n\nMy satisfaction with the meal is without a doubt FANTASTIC. But, getting a functioning ATM and/or becoming an business that can accept ATM and credit cards would make a big difference.

I've been looking for a good Filipino restaurant and I'm happy to say I've found one.\n\nPROS:\nThe lechon kawali, fried pork, is delicious. It was my favorite dish and let me tell ya, I usually don't eat this stuff because it is a heart attack waiting to happen. But seriously, it is good and surprisingly, it didn't come out all hot so I was skeptical but the texture was crispy and tender on the inside. \n\nThe garlic fried rice is good. I love love love garlic and the fried rice sure does have a wonderful and garlicky rich flavor.\n\nThe grilled bangus, milkfish, is also good. I ordered it with the diced tomatoes, onions, and mangoes on it and I think it would have been better without it.\n\nCONS:\nWhile we were eating, two homeless-like people came in and I guess wanted money or something. From what I remember, I was told they come in because the customers tend to give them money. One of them was this lady and I had to say out loud, \"Excuse me\" so one of the workers in the back could escort her out. If I would have waited a little bit longer to say excuse me, the stuff running down her noise may have dropped in our food. I know, ewww.\n\nThe Kare Kare, pork stew in peanut butter, was OK.

He was not impressed with the authenticity of the food. I ordered (something \"safe\" for a mid-western American like me) barbecued pork skewers and streamed rice. I was impressed. It wasnt too sweet and was all lean meat. The portion of meat was impressive. Some of the best Filipino barbecue I've had. \n\n After we got our bill, I found out they didn't take credit cards. The waitress pointed to this makeshift ATM machine in the corner of the restaurant. I reluctantly used it and returned to the table. As we sat there counting out money for a tip, a homeless man tapped on the window and pointed at me. I tried to ignore him until he walked into the restaurant and stood at our table asking for money. We got rather frustrated and just wanted him to go away. My husband gave him a couple bucks to get rid of him. I doubt this incident would have occurred if I could have used a card, as I doubt the pushy, fragrant man took credit cards.\n\nWhy would a business not take credit cards? Are they doing something shady and don't want a paper trail? Please don't blame credit card fees, everyone knows they exist and they just get passed on in the price you pay. Not carrying cash is not just convenient but SAFER. \n\nI don't know the city all that well but this didn't seem like a bad area. They need to hire a security guard and  get a credit card machine.", "author": "David B."}

I had already gone north into Glen Park, so decided this time to head south to Excelsior. Very conveniently or dangerously, one of the closest restaurants to me is Pampanguena Cuisine. Growing up in Miami, there isn't a large Filipino population. And while I was friends with many at UCF in Orlando, there weren't real restaurants to go to. Since moving out here, any time I have the option to eat Filipino, I go for it.\n\nI walked in to a table of four finishing off their family plate, and a few other tables with people. The nice waitress quickly got me seated while she was doing three other jobs. Looking over the menu was tough - a lot of seafood options, some standout pork, chicken, and beef dishes, and plenty of noodles. But as I was tired due to moving, I wanted to go simple - adobo chicken and meat lumpiang. \n\nThis is when if it were another restaurant, it would be lower stars - first I was told they didn't have any adobo chicken left. But they did have pork, and like I'm going to turn down pork? Next was their card reader was broken. I did try their ATM, but that didn't work either, so had to run down to the donut shop (speaking of which, I should head down there this morning) and get cash. \n\nWhen I came back in, a Filipino couple joked \"Had to get your fix?\" We talked for a bit and they told me what they had ordered - the beef stew and the boneless bangus, and had loved both. Some things to try next time!\n\nAs for my order: the Lumpiang were really good, nice and crispy with a tasty filling. For the money they give you a lot, and it took a lot of willpower to save half for dinner. My main meal was the adobo pork. Delicious. A good mix of meaty and some slightly fatty bits, and the sauce had the perfect amount of vinegar. While I did have half for dinner, it was tough not licking the plate clean.\n\nBefore I finished a regular party came in, and instantly ordered the family meal for 6. The great waitress suggested I stick around and check it out, as did the owner/chef who came out to talk to the family. When it was brought out, I was impressed and liked that the owner told me to take a picture. She either knew I was a Yelper, or was really proud of her creation. Regardless, I now want to get a group together to eat it ourselves.\n\nSpeaking of the picture, I posted it to Facebook and all my Filipino friends back in Florida raved about it. The second they saw the banana leaf, they knew it was legit, and when I told them that silverware was optional, they were jealous.", "author": "Michael C."}

I did like the onions and jalape\u00f1os  on it which gave it a nice kick. \n\nThis place is *CASH ONLY* but they do have a ATM inside which I won't count on. My BF went to get cash from that very old ATM machine and no money came out!! The funds has been drawn out from his account as well. So we told the lady that worked there which I assume is the owner, and she accused my BF of having no money in his account. *insert rolling eyes emoji here* Good thing we were only missing a few bucks and found cash in his car. \n\nAt first we wanted to come back to try the kamayan but after that incident & the food being just average, we probably won't be coming back.", "author": "Vanessa L."}

I have bookmarked Pampanguena for awhile and while searching for a Filipino restaurant on Yelp, this popped up.  \n\nGot there early so there's no line and I was lucky to find a parking space just right across the street.  \n\nI am guessing it's the owner and the owner's wife that's serving us and they were so very friendly.  Told the owner it was our first time having Filipino meal and he explained to us how to eat and what the food was.  Very down to earth and made us feel right at home.  \n\nThey use banana leave as plate and we were told traditionally food is eaten with the hands.  He also provided some silverware for those who aren't accustomed to the traditional way of eating with hands. \n\nWe ordered a two person platter and an order of 20 piece lumpia.  The lumpia came out freshly fried and pipping hot, just perfect.  The platter looked like a feast and came with a variety of dishes including pork, chicken, whole grilled tilapia fish, rice, mango/tomatoes/salty egg salad, and lumpia.  I devoured the entire fish including the fish head, it's that good! \n\nThey also gave us complimentary pickles and sweet yams to try.

I think this was actually my first time trying Filipino food, and I loved how authentic the whole experience was. My friend and I came here for an early lunch on a weekday (around 11:30am), and we were the only ones there until like 12:30pm. I'm not sure how crowded this place gets, but it seems like you definitely won't have to wait for a weekday lunch. \n\nWe decided to get the 2-person platter, and omg it was so much food. I think it could easily feed 3 people. All the food comes out at once, laid out on a giant banana leaf. Each person also gets their own banana leaf plate thing. Our waiter took the time to explain each food item to us--what it was, what sauce to use, etc. He also encouraged us to eat with our hands (the traditional way). It definitely felt weird at first, but once you get used to it, it's actually quite fun. The platter features quite a few items: lumpia, salted eggs, eggplant, okra, rice, chicken, pork, broccoli, diced papaya/onion/tomato mix, and a whole fish. LOTS of food. But everything was so good!! The salted eggs tasted a bit weird to me...but I think it's an acquired taste. My favorites were definitely the meats. The chicken was fantastic--loved the sauce they used. The pork was great. Both had so much flavor! And the fish, although a bit difficult to eat, was delicious! \n\nAt $26, this platter is a steal! The food is fantastic and it's a wonderful dining experience. Any questions that you have--the workers here will be happy to answer.

Great value for price paid in both quantity and quality. \n\nDine In - 5 stars for food, 5 stars for service. Minus on star for no real ambience, tables and chairs were pretty old, and parking was impossible.\n\nCatering - 5 stars for food (taste, quantity and presentation), 0 stars for packaging\n\nResearched places to cater a filipino brunch and picked Pampanguena based on combination of Yelp reviews and pricing.\n\nWe came first to try it out for dinner on a Sunday night and parked about two blocks away. We were early (about 5pm) and were the only ones there but as we were eating saw multiple people come in for take out/catering orders and by the time we left a few more tables had filled up. Servers were friendly and attentive and food came out relatively quickly. We had the longsilog and lechon kawali, both were delicious and very good size portions. \n\nWe subsequently placed a large catering order and the woman was very helpful with suggestions and portions. When we came to pick up, the food was ready on time. For 20-25 people we ordered 5 half trays of pancit, lumpia, sisig, chicken adobo and longganisa. Was plenty of food and we probably could have easily fed 40-45 people. Sisig and longganisa were the highlights. Pancit and lumpia were also very good. Chicken adobo was okay and was the one tray that was barely touched. Loved that the sisig and pancit were nicely arranged and garnished. \n\nSome tips for picking up large catering orders. \n- Call ahead when you are almost there so they can start taking the food out of the warming boxes and putting into cardboard carry trays\n- Come with at least 2 people. Parking was impossible both Sunday around 5pm and Saturday around 11am so we needed to double park while one person ran into to get the food\n- They are very generous with portions which is amazing but also makes the trays unstackable so either bring extra people or be prepared to make multiple trips back and forth to the car\n- Bring large garbage bags to put the trays in before you carry and/or put in your car. The packaging was horrible (just one piece of foil placed loosely over the top that barely covers the entire tray and does not stay in place). We were extremely careful and everything still got everywhere. The longginisa in particular came in a try full of hot oil/grease that ruined a favorite hoodie and led to a pretty expensive interior car detailing", "author": "Sarina Y."}

Since there isn't a 5-person size on their menu, we opted for the 6-person size.\n\nConsidering the enormity of the mountain of food that appeared at our table, our order really did not take long at all. Like a bunch of sophisticated savages, we dug in with our bare hands. There's definitely a technique to rolling up all the tasty morsels into tidy bite-sizes & popping it into your mouth.\n\nWhat an array of wondrously diverse deliciousness on that banana leaf platter. & there was so much of all of it. We were the 5 who ate as 6. But either way, 5 or 6, it was still more food for the $ per person than you'll find most of the time in SF.\n\nSo while my hands got all grubby & coated with the tasty juices of our meal, to the point of multiple hand-washings not completely eliminating that Kamayan odor, I absolutely feasted like a King! & on the cheap! Would I do it again? You bet.\n\nWho knows? Maybe with enough practice I could get good at scooping up well-composed bites with my bare hands. & for a bonus, they have karaoke. If that's your thing, tune up those pipes. They're game to let anyone belt out a tune or 2.", "author": "John M."}

Cashier was writing down all my orders & computing everything in her little pad. I thought okay weird she has to keep looking @the menu for the prices & did the math on the pad itself but whatever. So then she said sit down & wait for the order (I paid already). Mind you it wasn't busy inside or anything. They could at least offer me some water or anything but none. On top of that the cashier walked by & then asked me if I ordered already to her own realization that yes I did but she goes on & asked me if I paid already & asks for the receipt. I had to get everything out of my wallet in front of her looking for a receipt annoyed as hell & to finally realized she never gave me 1. So then she says oh yes that's right, your good! \n\nWhen I got home we ate the food, it was so-so except the sisig is REALLY good. I give them that. But when we we're looking at the prices on their online menu I realized they charged me WAY more for the whole order 'cause I'm pretty sure tax could not have been $10+!

It also helps when you love Filipino food, which I truly do.  On a lazy early Thursday evening, 4 of us decided to pay PAMPANGUENA a visit.\nParking can be a bit challenging but much to our surprise, snagged a parking spot across the street.  SCORE!\n\nOnce we were inside, and seated, we looked over the Menu.  It was pretty much apparent we were going with the \"Kamayan\" style dinner for 6. Although there was 4 in our party, they do not have a platter for 5, so naturally, we were afraid of not enough food, so we ordered the platter for 6. OMG!  Never underestimate a Filipino cook. Tons of food!  Our platter consisted of the following:\n\nGrilled Tilapia\nGrilled Squid\nGrilled Pork\nFlitter Shrimp\nSalted Egg\nLumpia Shanghai\u200b\nMango/Tomato/Onion\nSteamed Vegetables\nSweet Yam\nSteamed Rice\n\nA la carte, we also ordered (again, for fear of lack of food) Pancit Bihon and Sizzling Sisig.\nFor dessert, we enjoyed Halo Halo. Our two Beverage\u200b of choices were the Coconut juice and the Mango juice.  First of all, the food is very fresh and beautifuly presented. What an array of diverse deliciousness on that banana leaf platter, and there was so much of it!  Sure, we were the 4 who ate as 6, but either way, 5 or 6, it is still more for the $ per person than you'll find most of the time in SF.  It not only was exceptionally tasteful, it was also well balanced from different textures, crunchy, crispy, chewy to flavors from tangy, savory, salty & sweet. Also, despite the rarity of eating with your hands (although they are happy to provide utensils, when asked), I might become an \"expert\" at scooping up well composed bites of the platter food, instead of worried about the mess I was making. Practice does make perfect. Lol.\n\nWe sure did eat like a group of starving teenagers, who just came home from school, and left no evidence behind that a scene was committed. In essence, you won't go home hungry. And you might have some leftovers.\n\nPAMPANGUENA CUISINE is a Fabulous hidden gem. The owners are super nice, and you can tell they have love with their passion for the business.\n\nIt's not a fancy restaurant, but it is a casual, relaxed atmosphere.\n\nMy one complaint?  Maybe PLEASE don't be a 'cash only' operation.  Nobody likes to pay cash today. It would be beneficial to both you and your customers.", "author": "Janet T."}

The serving-size is good and we took home to-go what we couldn't finish. \n\nThe decor is on the casual side. Good enough for a casual first-time date. Overall, services was fast yet pleasant on a Sunday afternoon. They have good teamwork here. Our orders were delivered by different staff. When the food was served, they paused and took time to explain the item. The staff was warm and friendly and ready to strike up a conversation. \n\nTHE CONS:\n\nThe only mistake in our order was the Miki Bihon. My dad explained to me this noodle dish should consist of TWO different noodles, thin and thick. Our order had only the thin noodles.\n\nCASH-ONLY IN 2016. Our total order came out to about $80 with a generous tip from dad (yes that's for 3 people). My ego was bruised because it was my parents birthday, and I wanted to treat them out but I didn't have enough cash on hand. My dad quietly slipped me a $50. There's an ATM inside but my frugal mom gave me the no-you-wont-look. Why should I incur bank fees? Besides, I don't think it was working. This cash-only experience gave me a bitter taste. I WOULD NOT recommend this place for a large party that you'll be spending over $200. Who would carry that amount of cash on Mission Street? \n\nStreet-only parking can be a big challenge on this busy intersection on Mission Street. Be prepared to circle around. If you have children or elderly guests, do them a favor and drop them off first. \n\nI'll give this resto a 4-star (barely). The food was delicious.

In theory, these are fairly hard dishes to screw up and yet they were all really terrible. \n\nWhere to begin? First, the noodles were bland and the sauce had 0 flavor. I was worried it would just be sweet, but it was just flavorless and that was the highlight of the menu. Each pork dish tasted like it had been cooked in the morning and just reheated 10 minutes after we had ordered. There was a stale finish with each bite. Furthermore, it was over-salted overcooked, and just awful in every way you could imagine.\n\nThe rice was overcooked and cake like. All in all, it was close to some of the worst food I've had in my life.\n\nAlso, please don't interpret this as western food snobs showing up to an ethnic restaurant and having a soured experience.

It was just recently that I heard about Kamayan dinners. A meal that's made for parties of 2, 4, 6 or more with a banana leaf that's piled with mounds of food to be eaten with your hands.\n\nPampanguena Cuisine offers Kamayan dinners in addition to your typical Filipino fare of BBQ, silogs, and turo turo style of cuisine where you make your own combo plate by pointing at what you like from the hot trays. They also provide catering and is a good option if you need to bring something for a potluck (a tray of lumpia or turon is always a good potluck item). NO MSG is used as I called ahead to make sure if it. CC's accepted. \n\nThe staff at Pampanguena Cuisine is very friendly and welcoming so you feel like you're eating a Filipino family's house. It's a bit of an hole-in-the-wall that seats about 25 people with TFC blasting in the background. Not exactly a place to impress a date unless you wanna go home with blue balls.\n\nThe Kamayan dinner is the way to go at Pampanguena Cuisine as you can have a tropical buffet for just $13 a person. It's even cheaper if you go in a larger group as the Kamayan dinner for 10 is less than $100.\n\nOur Kamayan dinner for two ($26.95) came with bbq beef, bbq pork with a black pepper sauce (like a Chinese cha siu), a whole grilled tilapia, lumpia shanghai, fried eggplant, steamed broccoli & okra, two hardboiled duck eggs, two heaping mounds of steamed rice and accouterments of diced mangos, tomatoes and raw onions: http://bit.ly/YQwFbm. Several dipping sauces of vinegar, sweet chili sauce, calamansi, and bagoong (shrimp paste) was provided for your dipping pleasure. The meats provided were different than what was listed on the menu (I was hoping for lechon) but this was because they ran out of the meats listed so make sure to come early.\n\nThe bbq beef was tender and smoky, the bbq pork was plump with a peppery sweetness and the tilapia moist and flaky. You can never go wrong with the fried deliciousness of lumpia shanghai. Make sure to eat each spoonful of grub with the mangos, tomatoes and onion to get a pop of tangy tart sweetness. Nothing mind-blowing but the Kamayan dinner IS solid eats that will deliciously fill your tummy without breaking the bank.\n\nI use to cringe at my dad when he would eat with a spoon and a fork. It looked so unrefined but here I was shoveling the food into my mouth with a fork AND a spoon to get maximum grubage per a bite. Total savage status. \n\nTFC's popular show of \"It's Showtime\" was playing the entire time we were eating dinner at Pampanguena Cuisine. For 60 minutes, we listened to Filipinas soulfully singing hits from Taylor Swift, Demi Lovato, and Rihanna.\n\nMr. NSS: \"You're part Filipino so I bet you CAN sing...when are going to sing for me?\"\n\nMe: \"When you wanna go deaf, dear.\"\n\n*Hating my parents for never investing in a karaoke machine*", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-11-13", "description": "Let me say this: it's hard to find good Filipino food within the bounds of San Francisco. For the number of Filipinos here, it's a travesty. Without getting into the centuries of sociocultural baggage that has led to this eventuality, I will just say that I am extremely happy to have found Pampanguena Cuisine. \n\nComing from a Kapampangan (sorry Dad) family, I spent all of my childhood summers in Pampanga, eating Kapampangan food. Frankly, anyone that says that any other Filipino region's cuisine is better, doesn't know what they're talking about. And boy does Pampanguena Cuisine deliver.\n\nPrompted by an intense craving for simple, down home, Filipino food, I came here and decided to chow down on the Kamayan for 2. SO MUCH FOOD and SO GOOD. It hit all the right spots. Grilled tilapia, check. Grilled pork (with their tangy, sweet house teriyaki sauce), check. Barbecue chicken, check. Served with various sides of okra, eggplant, tomato, salted duck egg, mango, broccoli (ok not so traditional), and of course, generous mounds of rice, all on a glorious banana leaf lined boat, it was impressive in its immensity. (FYI, the kamayan doesn't come with grilled calamari until after 3pm). Eating off woven rattan plates lined with banana leaf reminded me of the fiestas of my childhood. Knocking it all down with a zesty, sweet calamansi juice was just the right kind of Filipino comfort that I needed. \n\nSure the decor is a little island kitchy and the 80's/90's soft rock/Celine Dion music is confusing when overlaid over the TFC showing in the corner TV but even that made it feel all the more authentically Filipino. Really felt like I was back home eating at my grandma's house in Pampanga. What could be higher praise than that?\n\nAll of that would have earned this place five stars except for the fact that their posted hours on Yelp say they're open until 9. Word to the wise, come before 8 since there's a healthy chance that they'll be closed by 8:30 (which they were when I first tried to eat here).", "author": "Mark D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-11-15", "description": "We were in SF area and decided to get Pinoy food. So we started looking for the nearest Filipino restaurant with the highest rating on Yelp...and Pampanguena Cuisine was there on the top 5....so, off we went. \n\nThere was only 1 table occupied when we came in around 12 noon and seems like they're still waiting to get their orders as their table are empty...no water, no utensils, no plates etc. - can't tell if they were there for a while or they've just been seated when we arrived. \n\nWe're hearing some loud discussions behind the counter about problems on the internet connection, 15 minutes later and still waiting. \n\nAround 20 minutes or so, a lady came to the other table and took their orders and then she went to our table and asked if we're ready - told her we've just helped ourselves getting the menu books from the front desk and no, we're not yet ready and off she went\n.\nAfter 15 minutes, we are now ready to order but there's no waiter in sight, 10 more minutes and still nothing. So, I decided to go to the counter and told a guy there that we are ready to order, and he said he'll be on the table in a few....Okidokie...\n\nWe ordered the 4 person platter (though we're just 3), priced for $48. My companions ordered a side dish of pancit Canton and Pinakbet.\n\nI thought the order will take a while as they will still fire up the grill for the Tilapia and the Squid but after about 20 to 25 minutes, our order came...not bad huh?\n\nOh yeah, it was bad...you can tell the fish was at least a day old, probably leftover from yesterday - dried and discolored...meat was stale and yellowish, not white which was supposed to be the color of a freshly grilled though previously frozen Tilapia - I should know, I'm a weekend grillmaster and yes, I sometimes eat leftover grilled fish from a day or two ago and that's why I know a duck when I see one. The squid was also very very dry, it's either overcooked or leftover too from yesterday's... \n\nall in all, food was ordinary...even the freshly cooked ones i.e. lumpia, deep fried prawns, bbq were just ordinary, nothing to sing praises and hallelujahs about.\n\nIf they would have just served freshly cooked ones on our order (well, they should do it on every order all the time), then I'll probably rate them 3.0 stars. \n\nI just can't understand why on earth would a highly \"yelp rated\" restaurant like them will serve a day old dish (or maybe 2 days? or 3? who knows, I can't tell the difference) just to save few dollars? Do they really really think their customers can't tell the difference? Is the $3 or let's say $5 money they've saved on that old poor Tilapia worth the 1 star rating I gave them? \n\nHell no....my companion actually posted the picture of the platter before we dug in and 3 friends already posted comments even before we're done eating, asking if they're good and yes...your guess is as good as mine...wasted time and money...\n\nAll in all, we've paid $83 inc. tax and we left the waiter $10 tip...... for the LAST TIME.\n \nLesson Learned...\n\nFor us: we're always skeptic on Yelp reviews...it's always a hit and miss thing....and missed things are getting more and more frequent...so, we'll probably just go with our family's and friends' suggestions...but they're a hit and miss thing too...lol\n\nFor the owners: Please, you're really not doing yourselves a favor (profit wise) if you serve leftover dishes from yesterday's or 2 days ago or 3...you're just shooting yourselves in the foot. You already have high ratings on YELP...the only thing you need to do is to keep on doing what got you the high ratings and that is...SERVE GOOD FRESHLY COOKED FOOD.\n\n\nand what happened to that poor OLD Tilapia?.....no worries, it will still be of use...it will be mixed to an Ilocano dish... yes, Diningding, that's what's for dinner....my Dad's favorite dish...", "author": "Joselito A."}

They say first impression last right? so we can say, there's negative & positive ones.\n\nPROS\n\nRegarding the food, we can't say bad coz it's good especially their inihaw. We just had their KAMAYAN for 6 people and ordered 2 for 13 person, and it's astounding, we still have to take out some of it. \n\nThe price range is I think not bad coz you're eating a nice and tasty meal, truly a home cook meal. We love it! \n\nThe ambiance, nice! If you're inside, It's just like entering into a bahay kubo\ntype of place. You're not thinking that you're in a different country.\n\n\n\nCONS\n\nFirst, this is a \"CASH ONLY\" restaurant... Not Good! They have ATM inside but as we know it, withdrawing money from a public ATMs means additional bank fees for us, so better bring a lot of CASH when you eat here... who brings a lot of cash nowadyas? too risky right?  Ofcourse they have a sign on the door that says.. \"CASH ONLY\" but the fact that you have to find your banks ATMs nearby if you don't want to pay some bank fees makes you a bit pissed of especially if you're that hungry, right? or else better just pay an additional bank fees. smh\n\nThe parking is on the side street only, If it's busy, you'll have to find some parking space which maybe a bit far from the restaurant. And remember, don't count the fact that you'll again paying for the parking space right? maybe $2.00 minimum an hour... smh... Ofcourse this is given to the fact that it's San Francisco area, but I just want to tell for others especially the ones that are not from around here, just want to taste their home cook meals. So just better be ready.\n\nFor their drinks, I think it's a bit pricey especially the \"Buko\" which you can't eat the inside of it coz the hole is a bit small, they should open it up big enough for the spoon to get in. We know that aside from it's juice, the inside is the best to eat.... better just stay with water.\n\nThe place is a bit jammed up too.... so, If you're a bit bigger, need to say excuse me to get to where you want to.... You know what I mean!\n\n\nIn conclusion, we had a good time here, going out full but the mere fact that we have some issues especially the CASH ONLY basis and the SIDE STREET PARKING FEES is just a 3.5 star for me and the rest of my family. Maybe this is not the eating place that you will keep coming back over & over, once in a while I think.", "author": "Lou H."}

The food was not amazing at all except for the \"DINUGUAN.\" \n\n2. The \"BARBEQUED SQUID\" was tasteless. No flavor at all. Dry.\n\n3. The \"LECHON KAWALI\" was a disappointment. It was old. Cooked days before. Akin to an order of another costumer that was a left-over days before; washed up; re-fried. Et voila! It was served to me and to my spouse!  Seeing it on our table was a shock to us. It was insulting, in fact. \n\nAs you must know, when the \"LECHON KAWALI\" Is freshly fried (or baked), its meat and skin should be crunchy; the fat- juicy, and overall color should be golden brown. Here, THE SKIN WAS NOT CRUNCHY BUT RUBBERY! The meat is dry and too dark. It was also served WARM, not hot.  It was a struggle eating it like me having to deal with TUG-O-WAR between my teeth and the F_ _ _ING PORK! Husband and I just tried one each and dang, that was it. \n\n4. I had expected a better food service from this place considering the fact that it has received a lot of 5-star ratings from its patrons. And for crying out loud, they even had a spread at the SFO Chronicle!!! Also, it is costly. Not worth it.\n\n5. Lastly, my  husband had expected an \"AUTHENTIC LECHON KAWALI\" as it is traditionally done (served as a whole chunk of pork and then, sliced into bite size when served. *SEE PHOTOS BELOW*). RE: the sauce- it is a joke. Too much gelatin. I didn't even recognize the liver flavor. it had a funny taste. Well, what do I say? It was a case of a recycled old LECHON! That's it. Honestly,  I sensed that the woman and the man who served us this were watching us all thru the time we were there; thinking probably that they got rid of their old forgotten LECHON to good use. Ha! Yes, we were screwed and we just decided to be  mum during the time we were there, dealing with this frustration and ordeal.

Had to leave out one star for service, however. Last time I went (Sunday at around 1PM), the wait was HORRIBLE. Had to wait ~20 mins to be seated and then another ~45-50 mins to be served food. I was hungry and irritable and it really ruined the experience... they also seemed to be all over the place that time, not cleaning up tables fast enough to free up more space for new customers, forgetting some things we asked for (like lemons for our sisig), etc. Would highly suggest that they hire at least 2 more waiters/waitresses to accommodate their customer flow!

This place is totally unassuming,  It blends in to the rest of the block and would not have been noticed had we not been carefully checking out all the storefronts we passed.  When we made it in, we were greeted by a very friendly young woman.  We were each provided a glass of cold water with a slice of calamansi, a nice surprise treat!\n\nWhile trying to decide, we noticed that they have a few items on the board listed as their lunch special.  We decided to share their 2 dish combo of dinuguan and chicken barbeque.  What we got was a ginormous skewer of full flavored chicken yumminess, a generous soup bowl's worth of some of the best pork stew I can remember having and a scoop of rice, all for under $9.  We also ordered pansit canton because I felt the need to pretend that I am eating a balanced meal including some vegetables, however miniscule they may be.  Who knew this dish would turn out to be so delightful also??\n\nEverything we had had just the right amount of salt, which is usually a pet peeve of mine.  Customer service was awesome.  Prices per item were more than fair.  What's not to love here?!!", "author": "Yvette F."}

Not just any type, Pampanguena style.  With my family being from that region, my standards for the cuisine tend to be a tad bit high.  So I was quite please to find that Pampanguena Cuisine wasn't too far off the beaten path.  Went here with two of my aunts, and all three of us were very much impressed with the dishes.  We started off with drinks---consisted of a huge coconut and the top was removed so that we could drink the fresh coconut milk.  We decided on the Kamayan for 3.  When they say for 3, it really is for a family of 5 or more because the portions are big.  It included a whole fried fish, squid, pork and chicken bbq (Filipino style), salted egg, side of onions, tomatoes and mango to mix with the food, grilled egg plant and so much more.  The dipping sauce sides were also a nice addition, this includes fish sauce, shrimp paste, and some infused vinegar.  We also ordered their sisig on a skillet, which was just as I had imagined it to be.  Lastly, we each had some turon (banana wrapped in an egg roll wrapper dipped in sugar and deep fried)----my favorite.  The owners Josie and her husband were so accommodating and helpful.

I know pretty much NOTHING about Filipino food except that it's supposed to be greasy. Also, lumpia are the most superior form of egg roll in the universe. As you can see, my knowledge is quite limited.\n\nThe nice part about this restaurant (along with the food) is the nice service. I felt like I was in a Filipino household! The cook/mom came around the tables, acting very motherly and very friendly. She really wanted to make sure you were enjoying your food. It reminded me a lot of my family, despite our non-Filipinoness. Enjoying the food is the best thing you can do to compliment the wonderful chef.\n\nThe food itself was great! We got the special platter for two people. It had fish, pork, veggies, fruit, rice - pretty much everything under the sun. I liked mixing some things and eating some things separately - it really leaves a lot to the imagination. And it's family style, so it's very friendly and really nice to eat with a date or a friend! You're supposed to eat it with your hands, but I opted for the fork and knife. Maybe next time I'll try my hands - that seems more fun :)\n\nIt was a great experience and I feel much more comfortable with Filipino food. I can't wait to try more dishes!

We found this place through Yelp and glad that we didn't pay attention to the bad reviews. It was a slow evening for the restaurant as it was a weekday. We had the place to ourselves and ordered fried pork skins, lumpia, garlic fried rice, pork barbecue, Filipino beefsteak, crispy shrimps, pancit (bihon and canton). The portions are big and good for sharing! We love the spring rolls, beefsteak, pork skins and the fried rice! If you're new to Filipino food, order the spring rolls and \"bistek\", you won't be disappointed! The guy that served our food was very accommodating and very polite! You don't get to see that often  even in high end restaurants. It's best to dine here on weekdays (except Fridays) when the place isn't packed and you have to wait for an open table. Thumbs up for a great Filipino dinner!", "author": "Ferlinda U."}

The portion size was really good (my boyfriend eats a lot and we were still both really full) and there was nothing on the platter that I didn't enjoy eating. \n\nWe've actually eaten at a similar Filipino restaurant in Daly City by In-n-Out and it was not nearly as good at this place! That place was a bit more expensive and their waitress was rude (and she also forgot my coffee until I was about to pay for the check)!  \n\nThe service here was amazing!

We sampled their Kamayan Apattan (a meal made for 4 people, usually eaten by hand). Included in the deal for $50 dollars is: Chicken BBQ (which had a wonderful sauce slathered on), Grilled Pusit (Squid), Grilled Tilapia, 8 PCS of steamed and lightly fried shrimp, Inihaw na Baboy (Grilled Pork), Itlog na maalat (salty egg), lechon kawali (fried pork pieces with Mang Tomas sauce on the side), Lumpiang Shanghai (Lumpia), Minatamis na kamote Sweet Yam), steamed veggies, rice and eggplant fritter -with a side of mango salsa. \n\nAlthough the menu stated that all of that feeds four, I swear it could totally feed 6 and those 6 people would either be completely full or end up bringing leftovers home. Meaning, yes the portions are HUGE. I also ordered their diniguan (chocolate meat, as well tell kids), Menudo and Bopis. Although I didn't try their Bopis, the Menudo was really good and the diniguan was fair.\n\nFor a small space that seats about 40 people, they do a really good job keeping the place clean. My biggest surprise was the bathroom.  No offense, but being in the Mission District, I prepared myself for the worst. The bathroom is extremely clean and nicely decorated. Something that never ceases to amaze me. The workers are extremely friendly and nice. They constantly check up on you asking if you'd like refills or if they can get anything from you. They are very hospitable and considerate.\n\nMy only disappointment? They ran out of Turon (Fried Banana with Jackfruit). Although, who can blame that? Turon is such a lovely treat, I'd be more worried if they had more left at the end of the day.", "author": "Shilo B."}

The salted egg also reminds me of the salted eggs they sold in Manila when I was a kid! And they're service is excellent. Really nice, accommodating family restaurant.

The snacks and desserts at the counter looked delicious and the owners were very sweet, encouraging us to \"eat, go eat first!\" and just pay later. The total for two items plus a mountain of rice is just $6- go try it!", "author": "Lisanne A."}

Henry's, Sushi Raw, Zabb Cuisine, Broken Record and to add to the list, this restaurant.  I've eaten here quite often and really LOVE their Menudo and Bistek.  I also order, on a frequent basis, last minute, 100 shanghai lumpias -- they fill the order, no big deal.  I recently had a house party and catered the whole thing from them.  Everyone raved about the food, and the party guests were mostly filipino, so you know this stuff is good -- there were some white folks there too and they loved it!  I want to also add that Josie and her husband are super accommodating and flexible -- everytime I called in to change my menu for my party, it was not a big deal to them.  You really feel like you're calling your Auntie/Uncle.  I highly recommend their restaurant.", "author": "Vicky M."}

The smaller \"Feast Platter\" was plenty (with a couple of extra dishes of fave foods) for 7 hungry folks - plus some to take home!  Josie was great, and it was super to meet her mom too!  The BBQ was best, with the pork, beef and squid vying for top choice!  Pancit great, penagpet too - and the sisig was as well!  Definitely a place to head to for some really good authentic Filipino goodies!!", "author": "Will B."}

There's always a large selection, and everything's well-cooked and unpretentiously served.  I always order two entres and a couple deserts.", "author": "Mark M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-17", "description": "My boyfriend and I were in the area and wanted to try Filipino food.We aren't too familiar with Filipino cuisine so we yelped and found this place. The service is pretty good, the waitress was kind enough to check on us to see if everything was alright or if we needed anything and I believe the manager also wanted to make sure everything was to our liking. We understood nothing, and yet the waitress was friendly enough to explain and offer a suggestion. I still don't remember the name of the platter we got but it is the platter for two people and consisted of grilled chicken, fish, pork, lumpia, assorted vegetables and rice. The chicken was tender juicy and grilled enough that you can taste the charcoal without it being overpowering/burnt. There wasn't any over riding spices which is a good thing because they provide dipping sauce so you can adjust the flavors according to your own taste. The platter set also comes with a sweet potato dessert that tasted like yummy bananas. I left feeling content. Will definitely come back to the restaurant if in the area.", "author": "L H."}
