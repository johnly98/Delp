I did only get a lukewarm tart, so maybe these are better when they're fresh out of the oven. But really I wish that the shell was a little more crispy, like others have described it it's texture is more of a crumbly shortbread cookie, and a little softer than a traditional tart shell. There wasn't much flavor to the shell, it was mostly just sugar and butter. The filling was a little more interesting, almost like a custard + cream cheese mousse. I enjoyed the light fluffy texture, but I think it could have been a little more creamy. Again the favor simply wasn't there. There was only a very light cheese flavor that didn't work as well with the already fatty butter texture and flavor. \n\nOverall, I'll probably not come back to this store, they were SMALL for the price (at 3.5 that's the same price as the massive egg tarts at Golden Gate Bakery).

Their box size is meant to fit a half dozen, so I just had to buy six so that it looks all pretty and fancy schmany in its little paper six-room dollhouse. Besides the cheese tarts, they also sell Brazillian coffee here which initially seemed out of place, but in retrospect, coffee would have complemented these tarts just perfectly.\n\nSo I brought my half-dozen of cheese tarts on a BART ride home and didn't get to try them until ~2hrs later so they weren't necessarily hot and fresh by that time. I was also going into this experience expecting a level of disappointment due to some previous experiences of overhyped Japanese franchises appearing in the states. As a result, I was quite surprised when I took my first bite into the tart because it's pretty good. Given that they're quite small, I don't know if it was $3.50 good, but it was pretty good. I particularly enjoyed the crust which heavily reminded me of a butter cookie place in Japan's Tokyo Station that lots of people I know loved.\n\nIf I'm ever in the Westfield area and am craving for a light snack with a cup of coffee, I would definitely stop by Bake Cheese Tart if the queue is not long.

At this point, we were both drooling and couldn't wait for these cheese tarts to get in our belly. \n\nI was watching a video about Bake Vheese Tart and found out that the cheese tarts are made in Japan then shipped all around the world. At the stores, they are baked a second time. They offer a chocolate tart (which is often sold out) and strawberry, which is coming soon! There are self-serve toppings customers can add on the tart, including caramel drizzle and more. \n\nMy friend and I each ordered the original cheese tarts. In my opinion, the cheese tart was average, and it wasn't anything too special compared to the authentic Japanese tarts I have tried in Japan in the past. The cheese filling was sweet and had a fluffy, light texture. The tart itself was buttery, similar to a shortbread cookie.

From what I witnessed, the employees had more cheese tart freshly baked from the oven coming out.

In fact, I counted as many as 8 employees chilling there, no wonder they baked multiple more. \n\nI came into my audacity and asked them to give us hot ones and they said they sold these cold like this.

She told me that they are from Hokkaido, I was there a few years ago, and had similar but not the same tarts. This store was established only in 2014. Not too sweet but definitely falls into the dessert category. It's very cheesy, when warm, the cheese melts in your mouth. There are a few ways to eat them. Including freeze them in the fridge. We also topped it with cinnamon, chocolate and caramel sauce. \n\nIt's already in Asia - namely Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam and Hong Kong and also Shanghai.

But it's not Malaysia, which is a bummer as I'm likely headed to Malaysia for work in a month. Though I'll also be in Singapore and Shanghai soon so that could serve as a back up plan should I not plan for another 20 minute wait here in SF.\n\nNow unlike Beard Papa which started its US journey in New York and took years to come to SF, this is the very first USA outpost. So if you want the real thing and not headed to Asia soon, this is your best bet!\n\nI think the reason it costs more here than in Asia it's because it's been flown out here from Japan. I like that it's not made here because you know at some point someone will mess up the recipe, and make it too sweet for Americans. I'm glad that they kept the recipe intact here. \n\nKids like them because it's something different. If you ask me, I still like Beard Papa more.

Saw that this place was at the Westfield and knew I had to try it!\n\nIt was Noon and the line was already around the corner almost to the BART entrance! I was in line for about 40 mins. They only had 3 people getting the tarts ready, 1 person packing the tarts, and only 1 cashier. \n\nSince I waited so long I decided to get 2 boxes of 6, which came out to $45.57! I don't think they allow you to get more than that. Anyway, pretty pricey, but I'm not downtown often so it was worth it to me. \n\nThe cheese tart was so smooth and fluffy! The perfect cheesecake texture, but light. The crust was baked perfectly too! I know they're not freshly made on the spot because someone said they're shipped over. But, nonetheless, they were great!\n\nI would definitely come back and wouldn't mind the wait again!", "author": "Fallon P."}

But I'm a believer and will always be down to grab a box from here when I'm in the Westfield shopping center!\n\nIf you're a fan of light, semi-sweet Japanese desserts then go try out a cheese tart! I've only tasted the ORIGINAL tarts and they're pretty tasty -- like a combo of cheesecake, pudding, and egg tarts. I like to grab a box and stash them in the fridge. For a little more indulgent dessert texture, try freezing them! The custard/cream gets thicker and more cheesecake-like. \n\nI've always visited during late weekday afternoons/early evenings as I typically go after work. I never had to wait more than 10 minutes in line. The staff works pretty fast at boxing up your treats. Unfortunately my late visits mean that I missed out on the seasonal flavors -- I still need to try the matcha! \n\nI love grabbing a box for snacking at home, or bringing one for a party/housewarming!", "author": "Bonnie Z."}

I'd heard about this spot (soo much hype) from friends, and happened to walk by on a Sunday when there wasn't too much of a line.\n\nThe crust was super crunchy and fairly sweet, although not overly so that my sweetness threshold was reached. It was good in a memorable sort of way. The cheese itself was somewhat ricotta-y (not sure where all these comparisons to egg tarts are because it's not similar at all), with a light sweetness. Think of the texture as a very, very fluffy cheesecake. Portion-wise, rather small (though cute), and that's coming from someone who likes small desserts in general.\n\nDisappointingly, even though they were baking the tarts fresh in an oven, they were boxing up the cooled (read: room temperature) ones, which made it less tasty. I would come again only if I was already in the area or looking to pick these up for a friend. 3.5/5 for me, with the caveat that it's pricey.", "author": "Nicole H."}

A dozen of the original tarts and half a dozen of the chocolate ones. Pricing wise, I think they were $3.50 each? Since we got them the day after, I first tried the original at room temp. The tart was kind of a mix between a cheesecake and an egg tart. Cheesy with a slight egginess. I liked how they weren't too sweet, but there was an element that almost made them taste a touch savory. I wasn't a huge fan of that. Later, I tried both the original and chocolate after I heated them up in the toaster oven and they were better. I actually liked the chocolate one more and I'm not even a huge chocolate person.

I waited until the hype died down a little and went on a weekday to avoid the extremely long line and the shop running out of cheese tart and it paid off. I went in the afternoon (around 3pm) on the Tuesday after Labor Day weekend and the line was not long at all (I only had 3 people in front of me). There was also plenty of cheese tart to go around. What I did notice immediately was that there is currently a limit to how much you can buy per day. They limited each person to 6 pieces per day and a 6 pieces box cost roughly $20-21. \n\nI tried both the Matcha and regular flavor. The Matcha flavor was very rich in Matcha. I think the Matcha was way too rich that I ended up not like it. However, the regular cheese tart was pretty good and very similar to Uncle Tetsu cheese tart. I would definitely recommend the regular cheese tart to people.\n\nNow whether or not it is worth about $3.50 per cheese tart is a different story. In my opinion, I think the price is a bit too high and I think a factor of that is that the shop is in Westfield SF, which potentially have very high rent so they would also have to mark up their price.

I'd say every order takes about two minutes to process (approximately).  I've been twice now so when you have time to kill you think about these seemingly trivial things. \n\nWhy do I do go to places like this? In one word: CURIOSITY\n\nCuriosity killed the cat, The Curious case of Benjamin Button and Curious George have a new member of their club ...curious Rod. \n\nSaw this place on social media and I was intrigued that it was the first location in the United States. When I saw there was long multiple hour long lines, I had to see for myself what the buzz was about. \n\nI snagged and allowed myself to eat one of each flavor of these pint sized bites. $3.50 for 1 and 6 for $21 (if you can't do math they have it on a sign next to the cash register).\n\nThe cheese tarts are shipped frozen from Japan and at the store according to one of the employees they glaze them and place the egg yolk and then bake them? (sounds feasible). \n\nThe consistency of the cheese tart tastes more \"liquidy\" than your standard egg tart. Since the lines are so long you are sure to get a fresh/warm tasting egg tart. To me it tastes like a light cheesecake-ish almost like the famous \"Zanze's \" cheesecake  in the Inner Sunset. \n\nHow was the taste? Solid but I have it in the middle of the pack of my rankings below.  $3.50 as others have noted seems a tad bit expensive and the taste while different isn't knock your socks off good but it's a solid alternative to the conventional egg tart. Would I wait in a long line for this place? No way , but if there was no line I might snag one. \n\nOf the two flavors I think I liked the chocolate one more because it was flavorful but not too \"rich\" for me. The \"regular\" was good as well so I'd encourage you to try both to see for yourself (especially if you wait in that long line). \n\nI recently embarked on a completely pointless quest to rank places in the SF Bay Area that sell Egg Tart...yes Egg Tart.

Glad to report that they are good but not spectacular and definitely not worth the price for me to want to come back for more. \n\nThis place sells Hokkaido baked cheese tarts which means you can expect a very balanced treat. Not too sweet and not too overpowering in flavor with just the right balance of crunch from the crust with the fluffiness of the soft cheese filling. The big pull for me today versus previous times when I've walked by here was the word MATCHA covering the wall behind the counter. Regular cheese tarts are just interesting but matcha cheese tarts are irresistible! I ordered 6 comprised of 4 matcha and 2 regular. They actually have a sign limiting each customer to only 6 of the matcha tarts so immediately I thought, \"this sh** must be bomb if they gotta cut people off from ordering too many so everyone can get in on the tart action!\" I'm clearly susceptible to suggestive selling and therefore the ideal consumer because I only planned to buy four but walked away with their standard box of six. \n\nLine is usually around the corner and moves really slowly. There is one register so they help one person at a time. Definitely something you shouldn't try to squeeze in on your lunch break unless you plan on possibly skipping lunch and having only tarts. Service is fantastic though once it's your turn. They are very friendly and package your tarts perfectly to go. \n\nNow for the tarts. The filling tastes like a whipped and fluffy cheesecake filling. The regular tart just tastes like a plain New York cheesecake without the heavy weigh you down feeling you get from a cheesecake. The matcha was delicious. Very strong matcha flavor but you could still taste the cream cheese and just as light and fluffy. Almost like a matcha cream cheese mousse is the only way I can describe it. The crust--oh the crust!!! This was the best part. I would come back here just for a bag of crusts! It's a light, buttery crunchy texture that only Japanese pastries get right. Not too sweet and really the perfect counter to the soft filling. I just ate another one before writing this review and I definitely think they taste better cooled off. They come warm with each order and the filling is actually a little runny and unappetizing as a result. If you go, get a box and have a few later so you can see for yourself. \n\nThe biggest scam? The ladies at the counter actually tried to sell me the frozen cheese tart saying how it tastes like ice cream cake and how my son would love it. Please don't try to pawn of yesterday's unsold tarts as today's frozen cheese tart. I would be happy to try one for $1; otherwise, give me the fresh stuff and back away. I'm good to go. \n\nThese are good but not life altering, especially for the price. Worth checking out and probably makes for a great snack after a long day of shopping while you're at the mall.", "author": "Betty R."}

I tried this on a whim when in Japan so I knew that the quality would be up to par here and (although it's hard to compare/remember), I believe it is!

I usually just grab one and eat it immediately.\n\nThe times I've been, I haven't seen any special flavors. One thing is that the browning on top is a bit inconsistent on the tarts.

A few minutes passed and the next thing I knew, there was another 30 people in line behind me.  I only ordered a couple tarts after seeing the person in front of me shell out $40 just for a dozen.   \n\nTaking my first bite, I was expecting to taste an egg tart.  But, I was very wrong.  The crust was crispy similar to the egg tart, but the filling was a lot softer and creamier. It reminded me of cheese cake.  The chocolate tart was not too sweet and had a slightly salty taste.  I was not as impressed since I am not a huge chocolate person.  \n\nOverall, I was very impressed by the taste and quality of the tarts.  The service was a bit lacking as they could only serve one person at a time and they seem to still be figuring out logistics.  If it wasn't for the steep price, I would come back often.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-07-06", "description": "I'm a huge fan of Bake but this first US location sure gives the entire company a horrible name.  All the workers always look so miserable working here, no one is ever happy or smiling and after my encounter with their manager, Leah, today...I can see why.  She can care less about her customers, let alone her workers.  That's such a shame since these tarts are always so tasty and reminds me of my vacations in Japan.\n\nI always make sure to get my cheese tart fix whenever I'm in Japan and Bake has definitely created a name for themselves in Asia.  Warm, fluffy cheese tarts oozing with sweetness but what sets them apart is their nice packaging and friendly service but this SF location is anything but that.  :(\n\nCase in point, today is their first day of launching their seasonal strawberry cheese tarts that has also been shipped over from Japan (nothing is made fresh onsite btw...all shipped frozen from Japan and just baked here).  Customers such as myself have waited patiently weeks for its arrival so it's no surprise we were all excited.  I got to Westfield at 1:30pm this afternoon and was told a new batch of strawberry tarts will be coming out at 2pm.  If you have been here, you will know that there is always a line, sometimes fast but sometimes painfully slooooooow.  Since there was already a line, I proceeded to stand in it not knowing how long wait time will be but to my surprise today, I got to the front of the line by 1:45pm.  Trays and trays of their strawberry cheese tarts were all ready to go, cooled enough that the strawberry toppings were already placed on them.  Since I did not expect to get to the front of the line so quick today, I kindly asked the cashier if I can pay for the tarts first, I will gladly wait to 2pm when they bring them out.  I was appalled when she shouted at me and said \"No!  they are not coming out until 2pm.\"  I understand that and I am more than happy to stand aside and not disrupt the flow of their line but to my surprised, she said I needed to stand back in that long line and wait again.  Hopefully, the next time I'm back up to the front, it will be after 2pm already.  WTF?!?  That makes no sense, why couldn't they just make a separate line for those just waiting for the strawberry tarts rather than making people stand back in line over and over again in hopes to \"time\" it right?!? \n\nLeah, the manager walked up and I explained to her nicely that I understand that the tarts won't start selling until 2pm but other customers, along with myself, did not know how long the line was going to take so we all stood here waiting for the strawberry tarts.  She too said no, that we all have to stand back in line and firmly said \"it's first come, first serve....you can get it if you are the first customers in line by 2pm\".  Clearly, that won't happen anymore since by then, I was only 10 minutes shy from 2pm and the line was growing.  I understand rules are rules but man, talk about no customer service at all.  As a manager, she could have taken control of the situation and started a new line or kindly understand that we are literally minutes away from her 2pm batch but yeah, that was not the case.  Leah could have care less if we wait in that line again and not get any strawberry tarts.  Her cold attitude towards her customers is a big reflection of how her employees reacts too which just makes it a nasty vicious cycle.  \n\nSeriously, I was ready to leave for being treated so poorly...I really wished I was not such a big sucker for sweets and that I didn't promise my family that I will bring some to dinner tonight.  Thankfully, I ran into my cousin and since we were chatting, I was encouraged to wait in that line again, blah!  The tarts are without a doubt tasty but the poor service that comes along with the price tag, I will much rather wait until the next time I'm in Japan or Asia to have them again.  Bake SF - shame on you!\n\nKudos to the girls that were a few down the line from me and did not take their BS!!  They created their own strawberry line and firmly stood there, telling customers to go ahead of them who just wanted to buy the original tarts.  You go girls!!", "author": "Janetto L."}

One day, I eventually sucked it up and waited in line. They were warm, delicious, and the perfect amount of sweetness. Needless to say, when I brought them back to share with family, by the next morning, the whole entire box was gone.\n\nWhen Bake Cheese Tart announced that they would be opening up a store here in SF, I was super excited. I could finally get my dad a cheese tart.\n\nI went on a Wednesday after work around 5pm allocating myself about 45 minutes to get a box before my dinner reservation. The line wrapped around the corner ending just at the door between the mall and BART. The dinner moved relatively fast and about 25 minutes later, I had purchased a box. They were a bit warm and tasted exactly like the ones I had in Japan, except they were a little more burnt. These aren't super sweet so you can eat many in one seating. You can either eat them fresh or refrigerate them for a firmer texture. Le bf who had never had them before wasn't really sold on them. He would rate them 3 stars. He wasn't a big fan of the crust, which was more like a cookie. My dad, who is a cheesecake fan, enjoyed his warm. But after hearing how much I paid per tart, he enjoyed them a bit less. \n\nWith the lines being so long, the cheese tarts being more expensive than the ones I purchased in Japan and them running out of the chocolate ones (there was a sign saying they sold out), I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.

The doors into the mall from the station open at 10am and there's ALREADY a line! It also makes the mall smell really good. So I just had to try one today. There were only about 5 people in line just before noon. It probably took about 5-10 minutes from the end of the window.\n\nHonestly, the line moves pretty slowly when all they have to do is bag the little tarts and ring up the customer. You can't even order more than a certain number of tarts! So I don't really understand why the line moves so slowly. There were 4 workers! One at the cash register, one bagging the tarts, one switching out the trays of tarts, and another who disappeared into the back for a little bit. It could be way faster if one of the employees was outside, taking down orders.\n\nBUT my confusion was melted as soon as I bit into my first cheese tart. It was like the world's softest cheesecake in tart-form, but not tart/sour. The pastry crust was surprisingly firm. It was room temperature. And it was just big enough to get a few bites out of it before it was gone.\n\nI would say it's worth $3.50, especially since it's shipped from Japan, but probably NOT worth an hour wait (like some other Yelpers have mentioned). You can't get more than 12 original cheese tarts, but I don't even think you need 6, unless you're sharing with 3-6 people.\n\nBut I REALLY wanna try the chocolate one now, but one of the employees said they won't be getting anymore chocolate ones until summer 2019! I saw a sign for strawberry flavor, so expect another round of cheese tart hype very soon!\n\nPS - they also have a self-serve toppings corner on the side.

The location is inside the mall so that makes it a bit awkward but the line is always wrapping around the corner\n\nComposition: egg tarts are firm in the middle and have softer shells, cheese tarts are soft in the middle and have firmer shells. This is the main reason why I like them so much, I'm a firm believer that a crust is just as important as the filling. You can tell that the cream cheese filling was lapped in with egg whites, because of its fluffiness\n\nTaste: the filling of the cheese tart is noticeably cream cheese (similar to a cheesecake) with a sprinkle of salt on top. When you first bite into it, you taste the saltiness but I don't think they mix it into the filling because I personally dissected the filling - it was sweet and creamy. So if you're thrown off by it at first, just know it's meant to compliment, not shock you.\n\nPricing: Would I pay $3.50 for a cheese tart? Yes. Would I pay another $3.50 for a cheese tart? Yes.

Mind you, there's already a limit of tarts each person can purchase. \n\nWhen we get to the front of the line, my friend decides that she wants to add 2 more.

I wasn't born yesterday to know that;  you douchebag of a cashier working on a Sunday 5/20 at 6:00pm. Talk about shoddy customer service. It's not like we wanted to add A LOT more cheese tarts. Only 2 more. TWO TARTS to the TWO that we originally ordered making it a grand total of FOUR. You're going to be stingy and make a bunch of lame rules . Where are your signs buddy? Whatever. High prices are one thing, but a blatant lack of respect for your customers is another. I'm never coming back. \n\nOn to the cheese tart. It's just MEH.

There's literally two (more often one since chocolate is sold out so quickly) products so these tarts should already be pre-packaged in boxes and ready to go. Customers literally wait for an employee to set up the box and carefully put 6 tarts in each.\n\nThese tarts are quite expensive, and a dozen cost me $45.57. There's a few ways to enjoy them: hot, chilled, frozen. Remember to eat within a day!", "author": "Jennifer C."}

And that it's not worth the long wait when you can go to Chinatown. Scratching head. Lol First off, these are not egg tarts. These are  Hokkaido cheese tarts that are shipped from Japan.  This is a chain located throughout Asia. I do get that it may be a preference that some may not like the runny consistency if you get it still warm, compared to when they are at room temp  they become more like a cheesecake consistency. \n\nStopped by after work today 5/15 at 4:15p. Easy 15 minute wait. The line was half way from the glass corner of the store to the Bart entrance. Moved pretty quickly. Greeted with friendly staff when I got to the cashier. If you don't want the 30 to an hour wait, then don't come during peak times. Pretty simple. \n\nI ordered 6 of the original. Per the sales rep they usually sell out of the chocolate flavor around 2 or 3p. If you don't intend to eat them the same day, they last up to 4 days in the refrigerator as I was told. $3.50 a pop is expensive. Asked my cousin in the Philippines how much these are there, less than 2 bucks. In Japan these are 216 yen. So were overpaying about a buck fifty. Happy to have it even if overpriced. At least we have the option to get them, and not have to wait til my next trip to Asia! \n\nWaited til I got home to nuke it a few seconds. Cheesy melty delicious. Tastes like cheese in a tart just as the name suggests lol. If cheese is not your thing, then you may not like these. The tart is great too. Like shortbread. \n\n On another note, though this may be the first chain store to arrive in the US, its actually not the first carrier.  85 degree bakery has Hokkaido Cheese Tarts that are worth a try too without the wait!", "author": "Erica M."}

The first time I tried this amazing cheese tart was in April, from a friend who had brought them from his Philippines trip & man, one or two were not enough. \nThese are not your ordinary cheese tarts. The crust is baked to perfection, perfectly crisp & the fluffy cheese filling is made of 3 different kinds of cheese from Japan. Each tart is $3.50 a piece, 6 tarts for $21.00, which in my opinion, is a bit pricey. However, I believe it's worth it!!! Their presentation is so nice too- they place the tarts in a box with separators so the tarts don't get damaged :) They also include a little card that explains the different ways you can enjoy your cheese tarts. \nMy family loved them & will definitely be coming back for more. You have to give these cheese tarts a try & you won't regret it! I loved them so much, that I brought a dozen back home to NY with me (to share one with a friend of course!) Lol. On Friday, I think due to the higher demand/busier day, they did limit one person to 3 boxes. To maintain their freshness, I placed my box of cheese tarts in the freezer. I tried one straight from the freezer & they're delicious!! The texture is still crisp& the filling is like biting into a nice ice cream/cheesecake texture! \n\nAnyway, I can't wait until my next CA trip to come back to Bake Cheese Tart! Also, when will you guys finally share some of the cheese tart love with the East Coast- NY? :) My friends & I will be patiently waiting lol !", "author": "Carla L."}

I was so hungry and had to start my day eating brunch - so I first ate at Koja Kitchen ( I will give this review on another post). Then I need to eat a dessert, so there was Beard Papa's eclairs and cheesecake, and finally saw Bake Cheese Tart opened. It was like in Japan on how this bakery chain specialize their take on a Baked Cheese tart, and this is more of an acquired taste. But I was so excited it opened and willing to try what this Hokkaido Baked Cheese tart is all about. Hmmm... saw the sign - each tart cost $3.50 and if you buy 6 for $20.93. These prices don't include tax and it is better to buy a box of these to share with family and friends.\nHooo... still a short line after 12:26 PM on a Monday afternoon during Labor Day. I know right, this is probably my opportunity to taste these Japanese pastries.\nI liked the packaging which is a box but it separates each tart with care. Very typical of Japanese ingenuity, care of packaging and quality of service and respect of the product has to be well- presented at all times. I am very impressed. Customer service and quality of product and service were all top-notch excellent. I bought the Original and the Matcha flavors.\nThe tarts are made up of a buttery cookie tart shell, and filling is salty, creamy savory cheese. So this pastry offers the best of both worlds - buttery, rich, crispy, slightly sweet butter cookie tart and the cheese filling is creamy, smooth, notes of salty, creamy cheeses. OMG... The original is really good as a snack or dessert. The ratio between the tart shell and cheese filling is right for both. Also, I tasted the Matcha flavor- the Matcha powder was way too bitter - they might have used Grade B Matcha powder not like the tea ceremony grade. So it tends to be bitter, but you get the green tea leaves taste. I didn't like the Matcha. I think the Matcha flavor is targeted for adults who are not into sweet desserts. So they offer these 2 flavors, and it is a matter of preference of taste. Bake Cheese Tarts are great for sharing to families and friends. If you want to give something special for a loved one, or maybe that special friend. Bring home a box of each flavor, and you will never regret it.\nVery few Japanese bakery chains venture overseas especially in Northern California.

Not sure why - maybe they thought they were going to run out or didn't want the line to get insane. But we came back about half an hour later to look at the menu and it was open. We were in a rush so we didn't want to wait again. Fast forward 3 weeks later, I came on a Friday afternoon. Wait was 35 minutes, which isn't so bad or as bad as I was expecting. I first had a cheese tart in Japan. And have tried a few places here in the US but have not found anything close. Until now.... Still not as great as what they have in Japan but pretty good and pretty close. I do wish it was warmer when I got it. They were steadily taking the tarts out of the oven the whole time you're in line. But they serve you the earlier, room temperature ones; not the ones fresh out of the oven. I had one right away and the cheese was melt in your mouth. The crust is twice baked, from what I'm told and it was crispy yet flaky.  I had one the next day after I kept it in the fridge and nuked it for like 12 seconds in the microwave. It was very good still. But prob best when eaten fresh. Worth the wait and price - not really. It's pricey for a small tart - $3.50 each and there's no discount if you buy more. I hope to have it again in the future but hope the hype dies down and I can just walk up when shopping in the mall and grab a tart as a snack.

I used to pass by on my way to work and see a line completely out the mall that would dip into the BART station which is absolutely insane. With that said, lines are relatively short now with a min wait time of at least 5 min. You're never really waiting for the tarts to come out of the oven as they are already ready to go, but youre mostly waiting for people in line to determine how many they want! Currently there are 3 options, the traditional cheese tart, matcha and gold matcha that has been filled with black honey and garnished with a little gold flake. The regular cheese tart is delicious. Super creamy, not overly sweet and if you luck out, you may receive a super fresh one. The matcha is bleh. It's all matcha and not much else. If you are really into a strong matcha flavor then this is for you. The black matcha though is perfect mix of matcha and sweetness of honey that the plain matcha is truly lacking. Granted, these things are pretty expensive and really only for treat yourself moments. At $3.50 a piece for a relatively small dessert is pretty pricey.

The baked goods just sit on the rack to be sold, but it's fresh and surprisingly still moderately hot once you get it. The original flavor and tart itself is good and you can definitely taste the Hokkaido milk flavor. The con is if you buy individual tarts, they put it in a paper bag instead of a box so the cheese oozes off the tart if you don't keep the bag straight. It can also be a bit messy to eat, because the cheese is melted. You can put it in the fridge so it will become cheesecake or you can put it in the freezer and it will become an \"ice cake\". I'm not sure what an ice cake is. I tried refrigerating one of the tarts and it did turn into cheesecake form, but it isn't the soft and fluffy type, it is more like an american cheesecake where the texture is dense.

I dont think i wouldve minded it as much (because i love cheese) but man, $3.50 for one of those? that price was a bit too steep. i guess you could say it was NACHO type of cheese youd want for that price. overall i'd say it was aight. biggest turnoffs were the line and the price along with the failed hype tied with it.", "author": "Patrick C."}

I happened to be staying in the city for work and decided to make a trip to the mall and get some things. I went with my sister and saw there was a good amount of people waiting in line at this place. We walked over to check it out .... $3.50 for a tiny little thing. We walked around for a little bit thinking what is so special about this dessert. Then I finally convinced myself to spend that $3.50 cause maybe it's really that good. As we were waiting in line, the customer ahead of us asked the staff \" whats so special about this?\" Then the employee says \" its the first one in the US\"..... so what? That doesn't explain why its special & definitely doesn't explain why it's worth that much money. First of all, if they used a smaller bag, that will save them a lot of money especially when the size of the tart is half of my palm while the bag can fit 3-4 chinese take out boxes. Anyways, this tiny tart tasted like warmed extra creamy cheesecake. It wasn't bad BUT it's not something I would  go out of my way to get.  \n\nBottom line, I don't know if it's worth the $3.80 ( tax included) . Being the first one in the US doesn't make it that special to me... it's all about the taste. I think I am better off spending $3-$5 on 2-3 really delicious Egg Custards.", "author": "Reginne B."}

We arrived 10 minutes after they opened and the line still took 45 minutes.  The line was not that long, but the staff are not the most efficient.  Two employees assisted each customer while a number of other employees handled the baking/restocking.  The two young ladies did not have an efficient system going, as one stared at the rest of us while her partner was ringing a customer up.  Why didn't she begin taking another order instead of staring into space? I feel like the line could have moved much more quickly, as it should not take that long to take an order, put tarts in a box and swipe a credit card.  The second employee could begin taking the next person's order as the first employee is finishing processing payment for another customer.  There needs to be better training.  As for the cheese tarts- they are like little pillows of cheesecake clouds nestled in a crispy cookie tart crust.  Both flavors (original and chocolate) are delicious.

For the price and the taste, trying once it is ok but It is not worth it to come back frequently to get it as dessert.", "author": "Anonymous B."}

The line was up to the Bart doors, 1/2 hour wait.  Not very efficient service.  One cashier and one person packing the tarts.  Other people:  1 folding boxes, 1 walking around (maybe on break), and 2 getting the tarts ready to bake,  When busy, one of these people could help pack the tarts so the line moves faster.  The tarts aren't made there.  I saw cardboard trays of tarts come out, they brush something on top, put them on cookie trays and bake.  Why do you need 2 people doing this when you only bake 3 trays at a time!!!  The person behind me said eat them fresh, while they are fluffy!!  Got them home and cut one original in half.  The filling oozed out a bit where's the fluffy!!  I texted a friend and asked how was the filling suppose to be because it was more like pudding.  She said that's it.  Again, where's the fluffy!!  Cut open a chocolate tart and it was more firm.  I think the original was not baked long enough!!  My hubby says the filling tastes like the filling in a cheese danish!!!   Not worth the price!!  If you still want to try it... wait until the hype dies down!!", "author": "M. K."}
