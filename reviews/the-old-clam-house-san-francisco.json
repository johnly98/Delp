Its good??\n\n\nThese were the thoughts in my mind after working up an appetite shopping at the Resturaunt Depot. \n\nThe resturaunt has been around forever. The outside is covered in fishing nets and decorative giant clams. You walk in thinking you're at a seaside resturaunt.  \n\nOur server greeted us quickly and served us clam shots and by far the BEST giant sourdough bread we'd ever had. This sucker was huge but it was so good that we had no leftovers! I ordered the cioppino which was packed with delicious seafood... clams, calamari, fish, crab legs, sweet potato, corn and red potato. My step father ordered the seafood linguine which had the same ingredients but a little more kick.\n\n\nUnfortunately,  we inhaled it all before I could take photos. Oh well, I'll have to go back for photos soon!", "author": "Mitra K."}

When we arrived, it was mostly empty and they told us we could seat ourselves.\n\nTo start off, they give everyone a complimentary shot of clam broth. It's still hot, so you know it's fresh. My friends and I slowly sipped at it and enjoyed the delicious clam flavor.\n\nWe knew we wanted to share the cioppino, so the only decision for us whether to order a regular size for $29.99 or the large for $49.99 and what bread to order. Based on the server's recommendations, we went with a large as it seemed like it was a much better value, and also ordered the house-made kettle bread ($0.99) as well as the skillet roasted garlic bread ($5.99).\n\nI'm really glad we went with the large cioppino, as the portion was maybe 3x as much as the regular size. It was a tiny bit spicy, so I had to take some breaks as I was eating to cool my mouth down, but overall the broth had great tomato and seafood flavor. My only complaint was that there was too much broth and not enough ingredients in the stew. If they're going to give us a huge pot of cioppino, there should be a corresponding amount of seafood in it, and there wasn't. Instead, they filled it with plenty of potatoes and olives, both of which seemed very out of place. Thank goodness we had a ton of bread or I would've left hungry!\n\nSpeaking of the bread, both types we ordered were AMAZING!! The kettle bread is really good value, as you get a huge round loaf of bread that you can easily tear off for only $1. The bread is very soft and soaks up the cioppino broth well, making it the perfect complement to the seafood stew. The garlic bread was amazing as well! We saw another table next to it order it and it looked so good we had to get it for ourselves. Highly recommend both!\n\nService was a little bit slow, but as my friends and I were in no hungry, it didn't bother us at all. \n\nI'm not sure if I'll be back again for the cioppino, but I wouldn't mind coming back to try something else.", "author": "Dianna H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-07-28", "description": "I'd say my actual rating is about a 3.5, same as the current overall rating for the restaurant.\n\nThis is a good place. You can get free clam broth, which tastes way more appetizing than it sounds. I've also never been to a restaurant where you can just have bottomless clam broth so I guess that's nice. The food is also pretty good! We got some crab cakes, clam escargot and some other stuff, all of which was tasty but kind of not memorable. The service was pretty good.\n\nFair warning: I'm a Maryland girl, so my judgment for seafood may be a little harsher than necessary--you may want to take my opinion with a grain of salt. But I didn't really think the food was worth the hype. It was about as good as mediocre crab cake you'd get anywhere. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't something I'd come back for. I also was a little put off at how expensive it is. I'm completely willing to pay this much (more, even) for amazing food, but I didn't think it was that amazing. I get the feeling this place was once better than it is now, as I once saw it listed as California's 'iconic restaurant' in an article that listed every state's most iconic restaurant. I don't think this is even remotely close to being 'iconic' in any way, especially not to California as a state. \n\nThe restaurant is also in a really 'meh' area of San Francisco. We used to live in Bayview and The Old Clam House was on the way home. It's not somewhere you want to go for fun.", "author": "Claire C."}

Inside has a lot of nice decor and was well remodeled. Doesn't feel too cheesy like those chain restaurants that try to imitate this style. \n\nWent in on a Wednesday evening, only a few people inside.  My friend got the crab pasta and I ordered the cioppino. This is my first time getting Cioppino, came out hot in a big bowl. The sauce was very good, had lots of seafood in it and crab and flavor. The seafood was hit or miss, definitely ate a few questionable mussels. \n\nThen I realized the bread I ordered and vegetables never showed up. I had to flag the waitress and she said the kitchen missed those items on the order... \n\nMy friend ate his pasta but it looked like he separated the crab and left about half the plate there.  \n\nWe overheard the other tables issues with their orders too. More missing food and poorly made drinks. The drink wasn't well so they added more liquor, way too much I guess because they gave them a side of mixer also after. Confusing. \n\nThe next morning my friend calls me frantically because he woke up with violent food poising. I had an upset stomach as well. Then I remembered the questionable tasting seafood. This place needs better management and quality control. I hope they get it together.", "author": "Yosof R."}

I love the host the waiters, some employees have been there for a while and are great people who have always offered me great customer service. I used to get the surf and turf with the filet mignon and crab but ever since it was taken off the menu a while back I came for their crab Alfredo except I would always modify it to shrimp Alfredo. I only eat Alfredo pasta from here The Old Clam House and the crab house at the pier they're the only places with the best Alfredo my mom is my only exception. I usually order to go. I recently went and I'm not sure if the bartender took the order wrong who by the way is always a pleasure to see I usually order from him or if it was the cook who got my order wrong. I have so much love for this place especially since its many of the few historic buildings that hasn't been gentrified that I was not at all mad for the wrong order but sad. I do not live in San Francisco so when I got home ready to eat my food I noticed my order was wrong which has never happened before so , I was really bummed because I go out my way to drive far and pay to eat what I'm in the mood for. So, I decided to call them and let them know hoping that they would offer some type of comfort reassurance that they care that my order was wrong basically some sympathy. Well I was wrong and beyond dumbfounded especially since I've always received great service from them. I'm not sure who answered. But, the guy who answered when I called and told him how far away I went to get my food to find my order wrong when I got home he said \"oh ok is there anything you want me to do?\" I was at such surprise I didn't know what to say and told him I'm just calling to let you know because I don't think it's fair and he ended the conversation with \"ok thank you\" the employees should be trained and have  protocols for such situation so that they can make their customers feel that their clientele is appreciated and not make them regret that they had such love for the place.

Granted, it's not in the most picturesque part of town, but if you want a classic San Francisco establishment with good hearty food, you've gotta come here! \n\nThis place has been open since 1861, making it the oldest restaurant in the city! Perhaps some gold dust still lingering in the air makes its way into the food and gives it that extra flavor. \n\nWhen you first sit down, each person is given a shot of hot clam juice. It totally warms you up and gets you ready to eat! \n\nStart with the kettle bread. It's a huge loaf with the softest bread on the inside and a wonderful light, crispy crust on the outside. It's so perfect with butter that I could almost be happy with this as my meal. \n\n(You can also order the cheesy version of this- covered in melted cheese and chorizo bits. I just about died when I saw it!)\n\nNext, I ordered the Salmon Fisherman's Catch. The salmon was cooked to perfection in a garlic lemon butter caper sauce and served with buttery soft pasta and yummy crunchy veggies. \n\nThey have a full bar with yummy cocktails to compliment your meal. \nThe decor is fun and kitschy, not stuffy or cold as some modern restaurants in the city.

I've been on a seafood kick lately, so when looking up reservations on OpenTable, I decided to revisit The Old Clam House. I made a same day dinner reservation for four for Saturday, March 10th at 7:15pm. We arrived about 15 mins early (parking was super easy), but were seated right away.\n\n*House-Made Crispy Kettle Bread ($0.99)\n*Clam House Whole Clam Chowder: Bacon, Onions, Potatoes, Celery In A Cream Broth ($11.99)\n*Caesar: Garlic Croutons, Shaved Spanish Manchego Cheese ($11.99)\n*The \"Original\" Old Clam House Clam Bake Cioppino: Clams, Mussels, Crab, Shrimp, Calamari, Fish Fillet, Potatoes, Yams, Onions, Olives, Garlic, Corn ($29.99)\n*Fish & Chips ($19.99)\n*Garlic-Encrusted Baby Back Ribs ($19.99)\n*French Fries ($8.99)\n*Peroni ($6.99)\n*Hess Select Cabernet, North Coast ($9.99) x2\n\nThey start you off with a complimentary small glass of what I believe was a seafood broth each. Nice way to warm up and start our meal. I really wanted soup and salad, so ordered the chowder and caesar. The soup was nice and creamy. I remember the celery flavor being very prominent, so if you don't like celery, maybe go for something else. The caesar was standard. Lots of croutons though which were left behind. I believe their cioppino is their signature dish, so I ordered that as well. Lots of seafood. I was craving crab, so this fulfilled that. The sauce was good for bread dipping. A friend ordered the ribs which I thought were okay. Not much smoky flavor, but very tender. I'm not eating deep fried foods at the moment, so I couldn't try the fish and chips. It was a huge piece and came with a bunch of fries. Not sure why we also ordered a side of fries, but I guess the more, the merrier?\n\nI haven't been here in about a decade.

If not, you should!\n\nOverall, The Old Clam House is an SF institution but doesn't fall victim to gimmickry. Generous portions of high quality seafood, deliciously prepared make this old-school style restaurant well worth a trip to the Bayview. \n\nFood: I'm not sure why this place gets 3.5 stars. Maybe the prices? Or the location? But let's all remember, this is seafood restaurant, and no it's not waterfront, but then again, it probably tastes better for less :).\n\nMy friend and I shared the clams escargot, the crab cakes, a regular size cioppino, and one crispy kettle bread (we managed not to eat all of it and that was actually a good thing!). I was so stuffed at the end that my elastic-waist leggings felt tight!\n\nThe clams escargot is exactly what it sounds like - clams with garlic butter and bread crumbs in a little dish with divots for each clam. It's actually a very simple and rich dish. And it is good--let's be honest, how would it not be?\n\nThe crab cakes aren't huge, but as our waiter noted, other than the breading on the outside, it's straight up 3.75 oz of dungeness crab without any of that BS filler. So, the cakes themselves don't look huge, but you're getting your money's worth bc there isn't corn or bread crumbs or peppers or, well, any of that filler BS in there. \n\nThe cioppino is theoretically for one person unless you order the large or the family size...and maybe that is true if you stop by here after your 18 mile marathon training run. Wha? I don't know what person could eat one cioppino by his or herself. Oh, maybe one of those carb-free people, but you HAVE to get the kettle bread to go with the cioppino! The sauce is the expected tomato variety but with a surprising and addictive kick of spice! You need the bread to sop up that sauce (sopping up that sauce...that's what did me in and why two hours later I'm still stuffed and wondering how I'm going to go to sleep).\n\nThe cioppino has generous portions of mussels, clams, fish, calamari, two crab legs, two pieces of corn, and olives and sweet potatoes. The only thing that didn't quite work were the sweet potatoes. I can't tell you why, since I generally love them. The flavor didn't work w the rest of the flavors.\n\nAnd, the kettle bread - it didn't disappoint. Crusty on the outside, soft and perfect for sauce absorption on the inside :). It's only 99 cents and a huge portion, you really can't go wrong. \n\nAmbiance - old school in a really good way. A little more spacious than the typical SF restaurant. You can comfortably move between the tables without sticking your rear into someone's food. The vibe reminded me of the seafood places in Maine--casual, weathered wood, booths, bentwood chairs, checkered table cloths. \n\nAlso, unlike 99% of the restaurants in SF, you can carry on a conversation without raising your voice. If you don't get down and dirty w a crab, it could be a great date spot. Or, maybe this is where you test out whether your boo is right for you--can they handle you getting down and dirty with a crab ;-)?\n\nService - attentive w a side of snark--and that's a good thing! Like I said, the waiter was the one who noted there wasn't any BS in their crab cakes. He walked us through his favorites on the menu and was quite friendly without being overbearing. Also, I asked for a taste of a wine I was considering ordering. He forgot it, so when he did bring it, I received a double shot to make up for it--lol. We never felt rushed, and given there were open tables, it isn't like so many other places where you feel like you're just a table to be turned.\n\nPrice/Value - this isn't a cheap place. But, the last time I made cioppino at home, it wasn't an inexpensive undertaking either, and frankly, the quality and freshness of the seafood is probably better at The Old Clam House than I can get at Whole Foods. And, I didn't have to cook it and don't have to do the dishes after. For the portions, quality, and flavor, The Old Clam House delivers value for your dollar. Also, the wine, when I got the glass, was like a 8 or 9 oz pour. If I hadn't been driving, I would have gone for one of their martinis. I hear they give you the shaker so it's like 2 for 1.\n\nThis place is worth trip and the indulgence!", "author": "Sara E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-12-12", "description": "A friend suggested this place a few weeks ago. I needed to kill some time before a Saturday appointment in Bayview, so dropping in The Old Clam House for lunch was perfect timing. The restaurant was very quiet, and seating was plentiful.\n\nThe decor pays a lot of homage to the history of the place. Interesting (to a history buff like me), but bordering on cluttered. I'm unsure if the decor of a historic place can be viewed as dated...\n\nThe hot clam juice sample brought when I sat down was served in a cracked glass. I enjoyed the taste, once an unbroken glass came out. \n\nThe menu has lots of very pricey selections! Most of my seafood favorites were in the $$$ range - prices you would expect at Pier 39. I settled on the clam enchilada with two eggs. By the time the skillet got to me, the sunny-side eggs were hard. The enchilada name was a bit misused, as the sauce and flavor was definitely un-Mexican. The filling of the enchilada was just okay; I thought the amount of clam was a tad lacking, and the clam flavor was overwhelmed by the other filling ingredients. Next time, I will have two enchiladas and save the eggs for breakfast. Or, next time I will save up my milk money, so I can treat myself guilt-free to a different item altogether.\n\nThe 99-cent bread loaf was too much for one person, especially one who is not much of a bread person. I will avoid the loaf next time, and put that .99 towards a plate of food instead.\n\nThe waitress kinda forgot about me, and never checked on how I liked the meal. Getting the check took too long, and when it came, it was someone else's check.\n\nOverall, a forgettable experience.", "author": "Tony B."}

It's out of the way, and the exterior looks a bit campy, with a giant clam shell on the roof. \n\nAnd I haven't had the best time at some other \"classic\" Bay Area restaurants. Tadich Grill (Est. 1849) was expensive and mediocre. Spenger's Fresh Fish Grotto (Est. 1890) served spoiled fish that got some people in our party sick (those who actually ate the stuff). \n\nWell I finally tried The Old Clam House (Est. 1861), and now I'm recommending that you try it too. \n\nThe Old Clam House is both full of history and unassuming. People stop in after work for a beer and to watch a game, but they also have a TV-free dining room). The place is full of old photos and memorabilia, of the genuine kind, not the fake ones you'd find in a TGI Friday's. \n\nAnd the food is good, and reasonably priced (for seafood, that is). \n\nEveryone is started off with a shotglass full of salty warm clam broth, which has a nice flavor and no fishiness. They bake their own bread, and serve at least some of it hot, like the garlic bread in a skillet, which was as garlicky and oily as you'd want it (or at least as I wanted it). \n\nClassic clam chowder was thick and rich with a touch of herbaceousness: very far above average. They also have a more modern variety with small whole clams on the shell in it, which I'll try next time. \n\nCrab cakes were full of fresh crab meat and nicely crispy. This place actually does serve fresh fish, still, nearly 150 years after opening on what was then the waterfront. \n\nThis review is getting long, but I want to address one thing that some people have complained about: the price. No, it's not a cheap restaurant. But let's compare it to other real seafood places like Woodhouse:At Woodhouse the crab sandwich is $35. At The Old Clam House it's $17. Is $17 cheap? Not at all. Is it reasonable compared to other similar food in SF? Yes it is. \n\nIn retrospect, a restaurant that's been in business since 1861 must have something going for it, and The Old Clam House does.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-07", "description": "The Old Clam House is the oldest restaurant in the city, and I now understand why they're still in business.  Classic, unpretentious, and family friendly, the atmosphere is very inviting with high quality seafood and comfortable seating.  The walls are lined with all kinds of knick knacks and signs, and while I was there to enjoy the food and my wonderful date, I also appreciated that the Warriors game was on in the background.\n\nI will preface this review by saying that the service on the night I went was really scattered and left a lot to be desired.  After being seated and given our shot of clam juice (which was delicious and buttery) almost immediately, we were ignored for almost ten minutes before being greeted or offered any water.  I'm choosing to overlook this because the waitress acknowledged they were short staffed and seemed visibly flustered, even getting into decently heated arguments with the other server about who had which table.  While I don't think that staff should be at odds with each other in the front of house, I'm pretty sure this kind of stuff doesn't usually go on, and I understand things happen when people call out, get sick, etc.\n\nService qualms aside, the food here is fantastic.  Apparently their house made kettle bread used to be complimentary, but now it costs a whopping 99 cents and I cannot recommend it enough.  It was some of the BEST bread I have ever been served in a restaurant - warm, thick, and fluffy with a beautiful slightly yeasty flavor and crispy exterior that was hard to stop eating.  It is served with some wonderfully salted and lightly whipped butter that was downright fantastic.  The serving for less than a dollar was more than my date and I could finish, even after eating way more than I should have.\n\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer and \"individual\" size serving of cioppino to share, and along with the bread it was plenty of food.  While the calamari wasn't the most elegantly seasoned I've had, it was fried well, only slightly greasy, and came with a couple whole fried lemon slices, which I love, and some sweet cherry peppers, which I haven't had served with calamari before and it was a great pairing.  What really made the calamari a winning dish though, was the tartar and cocktail sauces that came with them.  Each sauce was executed perfectly and the cocktail had an excellent amount of horseradish zing and tomato acidity that cut through the crispy calamari flawlessly.\n\nThe real star of the evening, and one of the restaurants' star dishes, was the San Francisco staple cioppino.  This cioppino was a little different than ones I've had in the past with a thicker, more robust broth that had more of a saucy consistency and very pleasant spice kick.  It tasted deep and roasted like it had simmered for hours and was wonderful on its own or ladled atop of their amazing kettle bread.  The cioppino had corn, olives, and potatoes in it, which I thought was a little odd, but I actually enjoyed every component and there wasn't so much of them that they felt like filler.  The clams were abundant, shrimp cooked well, fish soft and flaky, calamari firm and tasty, but I wish there was just a touch more crab.  Other cioppino's I've had at places like Sotto Mare make the crab the total star of the show, integrating the flavor into the broth, and here the two seemed a bit more separated.  Still, I enjoyed every single bite, and the crab that I had was well cooked, sweet, and delicious.  \n\nI will absolutely return to this old school SF establishment, and the only thing holding it back from 5 stars is the prices are a little high.  I'm never opposed to paying premiuum prices for seafood, and I don't feel like I got ripped off by any means, but considering the location and serving size I would have liked just a bit more bang for my buck.

True to other reviews, the housemade kettle bread was pretty darn tasty-- warm and with the perfect mix of soft inside and crunchy outside. And their traditional clam juice sounds less appetizing than it actually tastes-- more like a broth to warm you up after a chilly winter's day.\n\nWe went on a quiet Sunday night and were seated quickly near the bar. I ordered the crabwich with the $3.99 clam chowder add-on and my partner ordered garlic noodles with crab. \n\nWe were pleasantly surprised at the generous crab portions on both our meals, though the overall dish portions (amount of noodles, size of sandwich) were a little smaller than we expected for an old-timey place. Still, that plus the bread was the perfect amount of food for us to feel full.\n\nOverall, the food was great but a little pricey for a regular night out (came to about $72 for two with tip, and only one of us had a drink). The server was quite friendly, but was either trained to or was independently trying to upsell wherever she could, so it could easily get even more expensive. That said, I did appreciate she was always upfront with how much the upsell would cost, so I only mention it if you're budget-conscious to keep an eye on.

Seafood broth shooters were good, and kettle bread ($1) was easily the best thing we had -- crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, huge and served warm with room temperature butter (THANK YOU, Clam House for that). I 100% recommend the kettle bread.\nService was pretty awful. We sat there for 20 minutes before getting any water, and I had to ask twice (this on a hot day!). Our server didn't touch the table at all until we had been there 15 minutes. This when the restaurant was quite dead and he didn't seem busy at all! He never came back to check how our food was.\nI had steamed clams and my friend had the cioppino. My clams were cooked correctly and the broth was pretty tasty, but honestly it was just a one note wonder of garlic butter. I liked the sweet potatoes in there and the corn was ok (both were a bit overcooked), but since they were swimming in a bowl of what appeared to be 2-3 sticks of butter, it was too much. My side of veg, on the other hand (broccoli and squash, steamed) were literally unseasoned save a little butter, so I had to add a considerable amount of s&p. Cioppino was good, definitely big enough, but the sauce was a touch sweet (at least it had some heat to balance). \nCarafe of Hess cabernet was OK.\nWe didn't order dessert because I was guessing they would all be super sweet. That kind of place.\nParking was not difficult on a Thursday at 7:30. Not the best neighborhood.\nOverall,  nice to have gone for the history/nostalgia factor, but neither of us will be back.

It has an old school, casual atmosphere. Very relaxing and different than most places in SF. \n\nAt first, we didn't even know where to park (it took us like 10 min and finally parked behind the restaurant) and my mom was a little intimidated by the surrounding environment. She kept saying that the food here better be worth it. And let's just say it was!\n\nWe ordered the skillet bread, individual sized clam bake cioppino, and a sea bass (with the cherry tomatoes, olives, garlic and basil seasoning option). \n\nThe bread came in a skillet but it wasn't warm, which was a bummer. It had a crackly crust and the inside was nice and soft though. It was pretty big for only $.95. I probably won't get it again unless it's warm as if it just came out of the oven.\n\nThe cioppino was delicious. They gave me a bib, towelettes, and tools needed to eat shelled fish. There were so much goodies and the seafood tasted fresh. The sauce was great for bread dipping! It wasn't too spicy or salty. The only thing to note is that there weren't any shrimp in mine... I didn't finish mine and I think it's big enough to share among two people.\n\nThe sea bass my mom ordered was really good too. The portion is pretty big-- she was stuffed afterwards! It comes with potatoes and veggies, and this pasta thing that looks like couscous.\n\nThey also gave us shots of clam juice and I had their chili Bloody Mary. The clam juice was too salty for my taste, but it was great to dip the bread into. The Bloody Mary was probably one of the best I've ever had; it had such a nice kick to it. \n\nService was great. Our server was polite, welcoming, and checked up on us periodically.\n\nOverall, we had a nice thanksgiving lunch at this place and my mom definitely changed her mood afterwards.

Starting with the classic clam juice/broth shooter, and listening to classic rock n roll on the stereo. \nWe were there for the crab of course, so we ordered the Too Two Crab for three of us ($74) and an order of fish and chips. \n\nWe were a bit surprised that our waitress could not answer some basic questions about the order, like how many crabs exactly we were getting. \"A lot of crab,\" what she basically told us. Turns out for $74 we got two medium sized crabs. You decide if that is good value for the money. When they came out, the presentation was about as bare bones as you can get: two crabs on a plate. Weirdly enough, the legs and body were not cracked, and the legs were still attached to the body. I'm pretty sure last time we came here, the crabs were ready to eat without having to wield a mallet, which we didn't have. \nWhen we asked the waitress, \"How do we eat these?\" she said, \"I don't know, I don't eat crab.\" \nFinally I asked that the crabs be sent back to the kitchen to see if they could separate the legs from the body at least and maybe crack the claws. Away they went and back they came in five minutes nicely separated and ready to eat. Except we weren't supplied with crab forks or clarified butter to dip. When we asked for crab forks, we were supplied with what looked like salad forks...basically useless for dinning out those last delicious morsels hidden down deep inside the shells. \nBut we made do, and the crabs were well spiced and cooked and we had a fun time trying to get the crab meat out. And the generous wine pours for our glasses made it all go down nicely. \n\nI like the atmosphere of the Old Clam House, and hope that next time I go back they have ironed out basics like info about the menu, presentation, cutlery, and clarified butter!", "author": "Phillip D."}

I'm also not sure why this place only gets 3.5 stars. This place had been on my list for a long time. It just became my new old favorite place in the city.  \n\nThe seafood cioppino is delicious, it's base is thick and rich. There are huge chunks of tomatoes and carrots mixed with shrimp, white fish, clams, muscles, calamari and two huge crab legs. It's definitely one of the best seafood cioppinos I've had.\n\nThe clam chowder is thick and rich, really solid performance even without a bread bowl. The chowder has great flavor with large chunks of potatoes. \n\nThe seafood linguini had calamari, muscles, clams and shrimp. The serving size is huge as far as I'm concerned,  more than enough for a reasonably hungry person. The crab and shrimp Louie salad was also fairly large as well,  it looked fresh and delicious.\n\nThe service is great, our friends we met there have been over 20 times. They said they'd had special events like birthday parties and large groups for dinner and the place had always been accommodating.\n\nThe atmosphere is totally old school. I really like the classic feel of the place. More importantly,  the food is great.", "author": "Ben M."}

It warms up your stomach and if you're celebrating an event, you can make a toast and kind of break the ice. I dunno, it's just an overlooked part of the dinner I liked. We had a large group with Aleski (Alexi? Alexy? idk) as our server. He was very attentive and patient while my uncles and mom shouted over each other because they're old, Chinese and overbearing. But i digress.. On to the food. \nWe had ordered hella food but i'll stick to the things I ate personally. The kettle bread was interesting. Fresh, large, and initially it didn't seem so special. I was wrong. But i'll get to that later. I had their signature Cioppino which was pretty good, although nothing special. Same goes with the fried calamari. The dish that I had thoroughly enjoyed was the clams escargot. Theres something magical about the marriage of butter and garlic. Throw some hearty clams in there and you have one happy Joey. I'm salivating profusely just thinking about it. Now, the kicker with this dish was that after you've eaten all them clams, you have 2/3rds of the holy garlic butter mixture sitting all lonesome in that pan. Enter kettle bread. That bread is so spongey and absorbent, you just dip right into that pan and you've basically got yourself a whole nother dish. Just when I thought things couldnt have gone better, my mom blurts out to Alexi that it was me and my brother's birthday, and if there's anything complimentary he can give to us... Blunt, I know. Alexi didn't flinch as he turned to us and asked if we like tequila. We do. Comped us two shots on Don Julio while he served us the cake we brought in. As a guy who had to constantly apologize to servers for some of things my mom says, I give Alexi major props for taking everything with a smile. Owners, if you're reading this, give him a raise.

I did not enjoy it at all and will definitely not be returning. \n\nFirst of all, they charge you for table bread, and the bread is not even good. Secondly, while their prices do not seem outrageous, the reason for that is because the portions are tiny. The crab sandwich was horrible. It was on the same soft doughie bread that they charge you for on the table and it wasn't toasted or anything so it was just really soft and chewy, like Wonder Bread, and then there was avocado and red onion slices; the avocado, soft bread and crab made the sandwich just a big soft mush ball. There was really no flavor at all to the sandwich except for the flavor of the onions and bread. I am pretty positive they are using canned crab. But there was honestly, on the tiny sandwich, only about 1 leveled tablespoon of crab and the rest of the sandwich was onions and a little bit of overripe avocado: it was not good at all, even my brother who has a hollow leg didn't like it and we ended up just eating a tiny bit of crab out of the center and leaving all the bread.  This tiny sandwich comes with nothing and it's $17.  You can add a cup of clam chowder to your sandwich for four dollars but the clam chowder is bland and seems to contain canned clams. \n\nThey bring you a little shot of hot clam juice at the beginning of the meal, but it was totally flavorless, it could've been low-sodium chicken broth for all I know. \n\nThe fish and chips looked pretty good, but I don't know if it was flavorful because I didn't try it.  \n\nKids sodas are $4 each so so for two kids meals, a crab sandwich, a fish sandwich and two bread bowls on clam chowder, our total for lunch was $160. \n\nThe bussers were polite but our server was no good. She barely ever came to our table and was awkward and rude when she did. This place has been in business a long time but it seems that they changed ownership recently because one of my co-diners said that the place was totally different the last time she came which was a few years back, she said the service and food were way better back then.  It's obvious why this place is still in business after all these years: charging for table bread and putting a $17 price tag on a sandwich that contains a tablespoon of canned crab means that this place is making a huge profit on their crappy food.  Two stars for decent bussers and free refills on their $4 sodas - the rest is a total bust.", "author": "Emma H."}

The vibe is ok, with not much background music, but a warm interior. Most of the customers looks like they are truckers from the area. From the posters on the wall, it looks like this place has existed for a long time--the menu also says this place has been established for decades, and is one of the oldest seafood joints in SF.\n\nIn terms of the food quality, the place actually exceeded my expectation--the food is a little on the expensive side ($25 for a seafood pot), but damn it's tasty! The cioppino had serious punch, with a lot of tomato sauce, and amazing seafood. The balance was just right--not too much sauce, but just enough so it gave a lot of flavor without overpowering the seafood. Nice\n\nOverall, definitely recommend stopping by.

If you don't come prepared, there's a certain place that offers \"more beverages\" within walking distance. \n\nThe only thing I had here that I didn't like was the mussels.

The ciopinno has potatoes, carrots and . . . Corn? \n\nI figure \"well must be a seasonal special surely they have traditional ciopinno.\"  Nope. This it. \n\nVery disappointed I got up and headed over to anchor in the Castro which while farther I know to have the ciopinno I was looking for. \n\nI'm sympathetic to how hard it is to turn a profit at a restaurant in sf so I am guessing these non traditional ingredients are an attempt to control costs a bit on the dish. But perhaps it's just an attempt to differentiate a bit. But in either case I would implore the management to go back to a recipe that doesn't include these ingredients.

I'm a San Francisco Native and grew up in the neighborhood, we celebrated many events here and we all love the quality of the seafood. \n\nService was excellent! Our waitress Griselda gave us great recommendations and kept everyone happy with food, beverages and anything we needed. \n\nThe unique tradition of the clam broth served with the fresh sourdough bread still holds up over all of these years. My nephew, who is 7 and super picky - loves it. It's a perfect broth that is soothing and great to dip your bread in. they will even bring you seconds and thirds, if you want. \n\nTo start, I ordered a Blood Orange Margarita. It was my birthday, so of course I should celebrate. With that a few oysters which I enjoyed with some of the hotsauces that they have (if you haven't seen, they have quite the collection!). \n\nMy boyfriend and I split the sizzling platter of crab, mussels and shrimp - which is just my style. All seafood, no sides. My mom, sister and brother in law all ordered the Crab Louie salad which was not only beautiful, but had a lot of fresh crab on top. \n\nMy Dad ordered the calamari steak with couscous, which he loves. It's tender and delicious, so he orders it everytime without even looking at the menu. Family friends ordered the fish and chips and crab burger with fries. Everyone was very happy with thier selections and satisfied with the size of the meal. \n\nI had a wonderful meal with my family and that was by far the best present I received for my birthday this year.

Should have went to fisherman's wharf and fixed myself a $5-6 meaty, creamy and fresh clam chowder bowl.\nWhat an unpleasant experience it was.", "author": "Vladimir G."}

Only 2 croutons and no bread. My crab cakes for $17 were two tiny patties barely enough as an appetizer.

It's places like this that make me love this city even more than I thought possible.\n\nI liked coming here on a slower weeknight, because I would imagine it can get pretty busy. After being surprised by the complimentary warm clam juice (trust me, it's the bomb! Just think soup. It's really more of a broth, but I digress) My friend and I decided to order the chorizo bread, ciopinno for 1, and the fish fry to split. When everything came out, I thought we might have overestimated our abilities! However, everything was so delicious, it ended up not even being an issue. Apparently, it's the oldest restaurant at the same location in SF (1851), and it has been lovingly maintained, making its charm-o-meter go though the roof. \n\nThe fish is so fresh and delicious, even fried, it never felt too heavy. The Ciopinno was excellent as well....and the chorizo bread?! whoever invented that should be up for sainthood!\n\nI can't wait to bring all my seafood-loving friends and family, because it really is the kind of place you want to share with people to make sure they experience. Also, I want to come back myself and try everything on the menu!", "author": "Caddy M."}

Three of us for lunch mid-week, and we were given the worst service ever in spite of the fact that there were only 3 other tables taken when we arrived.\nYou are first \"greeted\" with a sign that says seat yourself.  Two sides to choose from for seating when it would be better if only one was open when there are so few people there.  The server, a woman, never welcomed us, never even smiled, and didn't seem to want to have us there.  She was very annoyed.\nI wanted to get up and leave.  Because it was a chore to find parking, walk through a disgustingly smelly neighborhood, and go inside we continued on.\nAsking questions about the menu annoyed the server.  She rushed us through our meal, which\nwas actually a Godsend since this was such a bad experience.  This woman is tired and\ndemonstrated over and over that she hated her job.  We shouldn't have left a tip, but there\nwas a busser who probably depends on her to split the tip., if she even does that.\nThe food has also taken a nosedive.  Crab sandwich came with absolutely no side - they are extra, and very little crab in the sando.  Fish & chips turned out to be one unidentifiable long piece of battered fish, fried to a chocolate brown color, and slapped on top of some fries that hardened into a big greasy mess.\nThe prices are outrageous for what you get.  They charge for some bread that everywhere else is complimentary, even if you're having a salad or other entr\u00e9e.  \nWe did not have any drinks from the bar, only water which they did not charge for. \nThe \"atmosphere\" is outdated, not on purpose I'm sure. \n I'm sorry we went there.

But, much to my surprise, there were a range of clientele here, younger/older couples, families, etc. and the place was really bright! \nWe were immediately seated in a \"booth\" (I think you could close the curtains to your table?) and within minutes, the hostess hands us clam juice shots! A great way to start the meal. It was hot, briny and salty, just flavorful.\nOnce we looked over the extensive menu (and because I'm a visual person, I had to check out Yelp user's photos) we finally decided on our order.\nFor appetizers, we got our usual calamari.\nI opted for the steamed clams, hubby got the grill plate with crab and shrimps. The kids got shrimp and linguine and clams and of course pasta and cheese. Surprising, our waitress brought us samples of the clam chowder because we told her that it was first time there. My first thoughts were that it was creamy and had a lot of texture. There was definitely a great ratio of clams just in the small serving.\nAnd of course we had to get the bread (for .95 cents extra. Our waitress made sure to let us know that it was an extra charge.) haha! We ordered 2 servings of it because we couldn't get enough of that crunchy, yeasty bread. \n\n\nOur food definitely came out quickly. A plus is that our food was piping hot!!! Like, super hot! Just picking it up with my fingers hurt. \nAlthough I'm somewhat allergic to crab, that didn't stop me from having a leg (or 2). What I loved was the butter!!!  It was rich, creamy and just delicious!!! I'd be able to pour/dip anything in it! The crab meat was sweet and delectable.\nI enjoyed everything here. We even tried the chocolate mouse and strawberry cheesecake dessert. Nothing to rave about, but it helped my sweet tooth.\n\nThe only downside is that the food was a little pricey.

I made a big mistake the first time Jamie W. and I visited exactly a year ago. Big. Huge. I ordered the Prime Rib, and it was lousy. What was I thinking? It was such a devastating experience that we didn't return for nearly a year when I was browsing for places that were offering a Thanksgiving dinner. Sure enough, the Old Clam House offered a three-course dinner for the bargain-basement price of $29.95. Jamie and I tried it and thought it was pretty good even though it wasn't exactly \"surf\". We received a double header of a Dinner Salad and a cup of their Clam Chowder.\n\nThe chowder was still thick and still full of fresh clams (see photo). Delicious and never in need of the oyster crackers. The Turkey breast slices were good, not great, with a generous ladle of gravy, a side of moist Stuffing, a small cup of Cranberry Relish, and a half-dozen of their famous Smushed Dutch Creamer Potatoes (see photo). A slice of Pumpkin Pie finished the meal in a pleasing manner, but I still felt my original three-star rating stood. Flash forward to New Year's Day 2013, exactly one year after the prime rib debacle. But Jamie loved his Fish and Chips the first time out, so we're back and me with a bit of trepidation.\n\nThis time we both went all-clam with our meals. Jamie went for the $14.95 combination of the Clam Chowder and the Clam Po'boy Sandwich (see photos). what was funny was that the waitress came out with the Clam Chowder first, and another server came out with another bowl of it with the sandwich on the same plate. But in an ironic twist of fate, Jamie doused the first bowl with more hot sauce than he anticipated and basically made that one inedible. The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. While the sandwich was chock full of fried clams, it was too much for Jamie who thought it a bit too chewy compared to crab.\n\nNonetheless, he devoured it. I decided to go full gonzo on one of their $24.95 Prix Fixe Dinners since it appeared to be quite a good deal. First came the Clam Chowder, and then my entree, which was literally a large cast-iron saucepan filled with a house specialty, the Clams Paella Acini. Finally we have a winner. Bathing luxuriantly in a thick, hearty cioppino sauce, the plentiful clams were mixed with bites of Italian sausage, black olives and melted cheese atop the acini, tiny beads of pasta softened nicely in the sauce (see photo). Crusty sourdough bread that came out throughout the meal was the perfect absorption vehicle. I get it now. You order clams for the main, too.\n\nThat was plenty enough food, certainly plenty enough clams. But I get a dessert with my meal. Oh darn. Despite the lure of tiramisu and chocolate truffle mousse cake, I thought Jamie and I could share a slice of Italian Wild Strawberry Cheesecake. Ooops, I forgot that we weren't at the Cheesecake Factory. It was a big enough slice, but it definitely came out of the icebox with a congealed strawberry preserve on top and strawberry slices suspended inside. It was drizzled with more strawberry jam and came with a dollop of whipped cream that tasted like Reddi Wip (not that it was a bad thing - see photo).

They rebuild it, but I can say the food has always been to my liking. Im yelping tonight because of an unexpected experience. Due to the cold weather, my husband and I stopped in for a clam chowder. The waiter was courteous as always. When the chowders were served, I added 4 drops of the hot sauce which is a habit to me. I must say it was a mistake. It burned my lips and when I read the label it stated it was called \"Liquid Stoopid\". The waiter offered to call the Manager and I agreed. I discussed the matter with Dennis, and he thought I was just asking for it to be taken off the bill. I suggested to him that it was not the point of the bill,  but that the establishment should remove this hot sauce from tables and offer mild, medium and hot sauce. This is a dangerous substance especially for kids. Please consider my advice.", "author": "maxine m."}

Very disappointing to find this out.

It was one of my folks favorite San Francisco restaurants back in the day!  They've gone through a couple of ownerships but I still see they are still cranking out great service and food.\n\nOn a Sunday 12:00 afternoon, my family decided to have lunch here. Table for 11.\nWe ordered a pitcher of Bellini's for adults, Pellegrino water for the kids.  We started with the kettle bread. Of course immediately came out, each a piping cup of New England Clam Chowder, chunks of potatoes & clams, SOOO GOOD!!  I ordered for lunch a Shrimp Louis. It was humungeous!  Usually, places give you too much lettuce, the Clam House seemed like it didn't give enough. Too much tomatoes that I couldn't even finish. But it was Delicious, with a smooth, creamy and  not too dressed dressing.  Shrimp was plentiful & plump. My family had various different dishes, my sister had the Crab Louie, my brother shared this huge platter with my brother-in-law called Lotsa Crab, I think it was a pound of crab. The kids (I mean teens) had Fish & Chips, they sure do have hearty appetites, they eat as much as adults now!  And my cousin & her husband both had some kind of pasta seafood dish that looked fabulous!\n\nService was excellent. Food came out of the kitchen with perfect timing. Our server was polite and friendly.\n\nI split a Tiramisu with my sister.

And then there is the enclosed \"patio\" room, kind of out there mainly for crowded evenings. Big screens all around for your sport viewing pleasure. \nThe classic dish you MUST  try, we were informed by the waiter , is one of the various Hot Iron Skillet dishes.\nDinner started off nicely with the crusty soft bread and shot of warm clam juice which is for dipping the bread into. The Hot Iron Skillet Roasted Shrimp with Mussels (Medium - $16.95) arrived on a sizzling platter and was doused in a buttery seasoning. The dozen  shrimp and dozen mussels were cooked just right, nice and tender. We had garlic noodles with dungie crab- it could have used a bit more crab meat , but the dish was good.

It's either the oldest restaurant in SF or in the US (unsure of which). But it's been around since the 19th century, over a hundred years old. The restaurant isn't that big but wasn't that busy though. We easily found parking in the back and they also have street parking in front. Came in and ordered the family size cioppino. Our waiter said it was huge and did warn us that it usually feeds 5-6 people. But the medium size cioppino only feeds like 2 and there were four of us. Anyways food took a little bit to come out. They gave us a giant round loaf of bread and we ordered a carafe of their house beer to tide us over. I didn't east my bread till the cioppino came anyways since I needed the carbs to break up the liquid and protein/seafood that was all the cioppino is. Finally they brought like this cast iron baby bathtub sized rectangular pot to our table. It was so huge - very daunting. We dug in and it did not disappoint. Rich, tasty flavor and filled with so much seafood.  Fish, shrimp, mussels, clams, crab legs, and squid. There was also some small pieces corn and potatoes inside too. It's definitely a once in awhile meal but I would not mind swimming in this family size cioppino tub every so often. I ended up taking all the leftovers home and it feed me about 4-5 more meals. They gave it to me in one of those aluminum catering/serving trays - that's how much we had left. Haha. Service was great and our waiter was friendly.

Today, the bar area consists of the original structure making it San Francisco's oldest restaurant in the same location since 1861. It's also a bit out of the way, on Bayshore in Bay View/Hunters Point. The previous owner, Chua family, had run this place to the ground and that was why I have avoided it for a long time. Now the new owner has added a patio and revised the menu.\n\nWe showed up for the 7pm reservation. The place was already slammed, bustling with holiday festivities. Christmas parties and birthday dinners were in sessions. Hostess guided us to the dining room facing the bar. Yvette was friendly and made suggestions. The meal began on a good note with bread and clam broth on the house. I would love crab but the BF is not keen on it, so I won't venture the 3 lb platter. \n\n*Crab Encilada ($18.95): I ordered the plate with two enchiladas (single for $12.95). Two sumptuous enchiladas with generous crab meat filling, diced onions and green onions, shredded lettuce with melted cheddar on top, served on a skillet with red tomato sauce. They do not skimp out on the crab. Every bite has crab meat---I licked the skillet clean.\n\n*Chicken Breast Milanese ($16.95): tender breast served with capers and very crunchy French fries. It's right up my BF's alley. \n\nAll wines by the glasses $7.95 to $9.95 and you can turn any entree to a set by adding a clam chowder or salad for $4.95.

You can drink it straight or dip the complimentary cold, hard bread in it.  Both ways were quite delicious.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed a couple drinks before the JT concert at Candlestick.  When I asked what the happy hour specials were, the bartender said they don't do happy hour (WTF?!!!) but then I looked at the prices and saw that most cocktails were $7.  For a bar in SF, I was ok with those prices.  I found this place from the suggestion of local SF Yelpers as a pre-show dinner/drinks spot close to the stadium.  They were right.  It was conveniently located a few minutes down the road.  Luckily we found a tight parking spot in the back parking lot.  The place was not busy which surprised me.  It was mostly an older, after work crowd and a couple other concert go-ers.  Maybe the location isn't the greatest.  Hunter's Point and lots of homeless in the area.  At least we were out of there before it got dark.\n\nWe ordered the calamari ($10), and I got the $15 pre fixe dinner, which included a generous cup of clam chowder (pretty good) and your choice of 4 entrees.  I got the crab enchilada.  Thought it was kind of bland but they were generous with the crab meat, and I loved the quinoa salad served with it.  Light and refreshing with a few veggies mixed in.  The calamari was lightly breaded in panko.  Nothing special but at least I got a lot of tentacles.  I also ordered the spicy Mary, basically a bloody mary garnished with a big red chili and rimmed with salt.\n\nI guess this place was bought by the same ownership group as the Stinkin' Rose, the Crab House, the Dead Fish, and Calzone's, so I did expect it to be good.  Food was average, but it was a good place to go before the concert, where a damn 8oz cup of beer is $10!", "author": "Carol P."}

Clam chowder super salty and ordered $50 platter of Mussel/Crab that was really dry and not tasty at all. Mussels looked like it was cooked to long. Tried one that looked really tiny in the shell and was rubbery.  That's when I knew the entire platter was over cooked. Took awhile for bread to come out. Bread came in a cast iron pan to look like it was baked in it but you can tell the bread was just warmed up and placed in it to look like it.  It wasn't a sourdough or at least didn't taste like it was?  Tab was almost $200 for the 5 of us.  We order 2 pasta plates that were okay.  I apologized to kids who are native SFers and waiting a long time to eat  crab. They know what it should taste like. (I made it up to them and cooked 7 Dungeness crabs for them the next night. )(There was a halt with the crab season in the Bay Area because of issues). \n\nA little disappointed.  Loved the nostalgia and warm memories the place I had  eating here with parents.  Wanted my kids to have the same but the food was not so good.   \n\nWill try again because maybe it was a bad night and this can be such a great place because of locale and I know many Native San Franciscans would come back if they knew the food was good.", "author": "Leilani I."}

After we had finish eating i went to the bathroom to wash my hands before we left. As i was returning back from the bathroom the Host was jumping all around and acting completely unprofessional. I spoke up to let the Host know that i was walking up behind him so he would be aware of me approaching. He continued to play and jump around like a little child. When the Host finally jumped and turned around he hit me extremely hard in my left eye with his forehead. The Host knew what had just happened and did not even attempt to apologize to me for striking me in the eye. No one from The Old Clam House came to ask if i was ok, no one seemed to care if i was hurt or needed any type of medical attention. Another customer was more concerned about my well being than The Old Clam House employees. After about 15 to 20 mins our waiter finally came to ask if i was ok. We waited for a very long time for a manager to show up. After waiting for what seemed to be a life time, was told that they do not have any managers available to come and speak with me. I find this completely and totally unexpectable. The employees are childish and should not be allowed to work in an environment where they can potentially hurt a customer. Management is non existence and can care less of their customers and for their employers. When the regional manager finally responed he asked if i needed a paramedic I declined at the time because there was no swelling. I did receive a discount for our meal not because of management, our server  took it upon themselves to give us a discount for what we have been through. Management was a very huge disappointment and i can only hope that the owners of the restaurant will be able to see this complaint and be able to rectify the problem. I have been in many situations before, this one is absolutely the worst. No leadership, no discipline and zero fucks given.", "author": "Peruanita B."}

If things had been different than maybe I can be in their shoes too.\n\nBut here I am, 21 for the 10th year with a \"23 year-old boy toy\" (as he likes to tells everyone) and a 8-pound bark-a-fluff named Teddy, my closest thing to a child except he doubles as a cockblocker. \n\nNaturally, during my delayed quarter life crisis, I turned to Mr. NSS for comfort. Like any good bf, he tried to cheer me up by telling me he was my 400th Yelp fan. He said, he kept tabs on my page and when he noticed I was at 399 (while he was driving), he pulled over the side of the road just to google how to fan someone on Yelp. Awwwww...he truly knows the way to a Yelp addict's heart. He then asked, \"Where are you dragging me next so you can write a review and take 6969 pics for Yelp?\"\n\nOld Clam House was my choice, San Francisco's oldest restaurant. A very fitting choice given the way I was feeling. \n\nI've never visited Old Clam House, an SF institution which existed since Lincoln was president. I heard things have changed since The Stinking Rose (http://bit.ly/ROSgfN)/Bobo's (http://bit.ly/UQKeY1) had taken over last year; namely, the menu changes, higher prices and smaller portions. However, being a fan of both places, the Old Clam House seemed promising. Too bad it was a disappointment just like their other sister restaurant, Crab House at Pier 39 minus the attitude (http://bit.ly/U9HRvx).\n\nDinner started off nicely with the complimentary crusty soft bread and shot of warm clam juice which is for dipping the bread into http://bit.ly/UQI7DH. The Hot Iron Skillet Roasted Shrimp (Medium - $14.95) arrived on a sizzling platter and was robust in buttery seasoning http://bit.ly/10gijQH. The nearly two dozen of shrimp were a bit overcooked though. The Lotsa Crab ($49.95) was a complete waste of money http://bit.ly/WgFHd3. The BLAND crab legs managed to be oily (from butter it was cooked in) and dry at the same time. The crab was extremely overcooked, making the crab meat stringy and super dry. Even worse, there was barely any seasoning so I actually used hot sauce on the table for flavoring. You're better off going to PPQ in Outer Richmond for a complete 5 course crab meal for two for the same price as this platter. What a shame considering its crab season and I couldn't tell if the crab was fresh because it was SO overcooked. For a seafood restaurant, the Bone-in Filet ($29.95) was surprisingly solid http://bit.ly/UD4nLb. It was perfectly cooked to a medium rare with a delicious tenderness. The creamed spinach was an unappetizing greenish brown color but the divinely soft smushed potatoes made up for it.\n\nService was friendly enough but slow. Considering it was pretty dead on a Wednesday night, I can't imagine it being all that stellar or timely when it's busier on the weekends. \n\nGetting a little taste of San Francisco history wasn't cheap. There are way too many options in the city with far superior food to be spending $140 for an overall mediocre dinner for two. Anchor Oyster Bar (http://bit.ly/U9FvMY) and Sotto Mare (http://bit.ly/XWgXMn) are my top two choices for seafood in SF.  Plus the ambiance at the Old Clam House was still a bit dreary despite the remodel which didn't help my cause. \n\nHmmm, I guess it's a good thing that I use my Ben Wa Balls (http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Wa_balls) to keep me from being an Old Clam.

Easy street parking.  I would definitely though park on Bayshore as opposed to the backside streets which are darker and with fewer pedestrians/traffic.\n\n2)  cioppino is definitely the best imo and until i taste better it holds the title.  It simply is my favorite and pretty much the only dish I order when I come here, every time.  \n\n3)  the excellent cup of complementary broth that they serve you to start your food journey off.

As another patron from last night indicated, the service was not good because of a new waiter and some other issues. We never received the clam juice that usually greets us, and there were lots of other service issues. While the food is generally good, I want to mention a confusing issue on the menu. The \"golden clam chowder\" costs $7.99, while the same chowder in a bread bowl costs $10.99. When we asked for two orders not in a bread bowl, she asked if we wanted bread. Since they always used to provide a few slices of great San Francisco french bread, I asked if it was complimentary, and she said yes. When she brought a round kettle loaf like the one another patron raved about, we were happy, even if the menu did say it costs $.99.  However, when we received the bill and were charged $10.99 each for the bread bowl chowder as well as the $.99 bread, I questioned her. She explained that the $7.99 order is called a \"cup\", even though the menu does not say that. We saw the size of the $7.99 order at the table next to us, and it is much more than a usual restaurant cup -- more like a medium dinnerware bowl. We would have been quite happy with that.

The cioppino was fantastic, although we did order a \"couples\" cioppino to split between four people and they accidentally brought us a single one - they later brought us another single one to make up for it. The first batch we had was kind of thick and I didn't like that, but the second one came out super piping hot and more soupy and cioppino-like (what I'm used to) and I enjoyed it a lot more. It was also a bit chilly outside so it warmed me up real nice!\n\nI'm excited to come back here and try more things! Other things I dug was the clam juice starter, which we got two shots of because we think they didn't know we already had some (we didn't complain).

In the middle of Bayshore Blvd, there isn't really anything around except a few fast food chains and warehouse manufacturers. The staff was friendly and they provide bread with clam broth for dipping. I ordered the crab salad and it was quite delicious, they use real crab meat so that's a plus. But do I really think $15-$18 is worth the salad, maybe not.\n\nThe pricing for this place is a little off for me, given that they do serve seafood, I still think I can pay the same price for something even more gourmet.

A woman, not our server, brought a pan with a lid on it to the table, put it down, took the lid off, and said something like, \"Here you go\" or maybe \"Sand Dabs,\" I am not sure. She left us with the hot pan, no way to serve it, no plates to serve it on. Who knows if they were fresh.\n\nAs I was paying the bill my date asked if I thought we should help bring the dishes back to the kitchen.\n\nIf you want crab, go to safeway/WF and get a cracked crab + a bottle of dry white wine + a nice bagette and eat at home.\n\nWTF deep frying a frozen Alaskan crab in an authentic SF searfood restaurant?

Made a reservation for 6:30 on Sunday just in case there was a crows (there wasn't). Due to traffic we were about 10 minutes late and even though our friends were already there, the greeter told us our reservation had been cancelled. \n\nGood thing the house was mostly empty so seating was no problem. Plenty of sea food for four to start and great kettle bread to go with it.\n \nThree of us had the Cioppino which is made with chunks of corn, potatoes and canned black olives at the Old Clam House, actually tastes great and makes an interesting variation on the more traditional styles.  Beloved had a large salad with grilled shrimp. \n\nThe service was as sketchy as the neighborhood.  For three people eating the Cioppino, we only got one spoon and one bib despite repeated requests. The server never bothered to check back for drink refills and the food came out in raggedy order with the double order of Cioppino they had taking more than 10 minutes more than my single order.  Considering that the house was less than \u00bc full, there is no excuse for this. \n\nThe Clam House is in the same building that it has been in since the 1800's on Bayshore in Bernal \"Depths\" which is a pretty sketchy neighborhood. As we parked in the alley behind we saw at least three instances of shattered window glass. We parked the old mini van with a note that the doors were open and there was NOTHING to take. As we left, a family parked near where we were sadly looked at the shattered hatch of their car and told us that all their luggage was gone. \n\nIt is that kind of a neighborhood. \n\nPark on the street if you can.\n\nOverall we would give this visit a low B.

I have been dining at the Old Clam House since the early 80's and it was my ultimate favorite seafood restaurant. Since I was in the City today, my husband and I decided to stop by for dinner around 7pm. The first indication of significant change was that the clam broth came out without their iconic sourdough bread and butter. I searched the menu for Shrimp Scampi and it no longer exists. I asked the waiter about a regular bowl of clam chowder and was told that it's the same price as the bread bowl of chowder. Ok, no problem. So, I decide to order a regular bowl of Clam Chowder and a Crab Louie, only to find out that they no longer serve San Francisco Sourdough bread! WHATTTTT?!!! I understand new ownership, but if your going to keep the same name, the restaurant should serve most of the same items. The Old Clam House use to be a San Francisco staple, now it no longer exists!

We discovered a tiny lot behind the restaurant and parked in front of their trash bins. The smell was awful and right behind our car was a dead, decaying rat. Obese flies (and probably blind) smacked into our faces left and right.\n\nWe expected the restaurant to be busier since we were told to make a reservation. We came in around 3:30pm (on a Thursday) and the restaurant had only 3 tables and a few patrons at the bar. We seated ourselves and a kitchen staff/bus-staff brought out two shot glasses of overly salty seafood broth, cold bread, and piss-yellow, dry, hard butter.\n\nWe ordered and presented our Groupons: $17 for a whole 2lb crab or regular cut prime rib. We got both and a side of their \"Mashed Yukon Potato and Zucchini,\" Italian Wild Strawberry Cheesecake, and a Coke. The other stuff amounted to about $18. With tips and everything, we spent over $60 and I really wish that $60 was spent elsewhere.\n\nService was ok; not great, not bad. The people were friendly. I would've really appreciated it if our server had told me that the prime rib came with a side of their \"potato\" already so we wouldn't have ordered another side of their \"potato\" which we never touched. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the crab and as he said, \"it's not very good.\" My boyfriend is not that picky with his crab. Freshly steamed crab is his favorite. No seasoning required. So for him to say the crab was no good, I'm guessing it wasn't very fresh. It did come out really fast, like less than 10 minutes. We've steamed crabs at home and it takes longer than 10 minutes.\n\nThe prime rib came with 6 pieces of their \"Smushed Dutch Creamer Potato.\" The steak was huge. It was at least 20oz. BUT there was more fat than meat. I lopped off all the fat and the portion of steak compared to fat was pathetic (like less than half). It tasted fine, I guess. The potatoes looked like they got stepped on. I kid you not. I've never had \"Dutch\" potatoes and I am not making fun of the Dutch. Maybe that's just The Old Clam House's interpretation of that dish. Seriously, what did those poor petite potatoes do to you? They were served with some sour cream on the side. Flavorless and very greasy.\n\nThe \"Mashed Yukon Potato and Zucchini\" came out to be exactly like the \"Smushed Dutch Creamer Potato.\" Six pieces for $5.95. A buck for a tiny stepped-on potato!? And I don't know why I got more stepped-on potatoes. I thought I was getting mashed potato. They gave us two menus and one menu had \"Mashed...\" and the other had \"Smushed...\" I don't know.\n\nThe cheesecake could have been better. A sliver of a four-layer cake with alternating yellow cake and cream cheese topped with a strawberry/raspberry compote jelly. The cream cheese was light and airy but still creamy. I liked the cake instead of the usual graham cracker crust but the cake was really wet. Not worth $7.95.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-28", "description": "Good food in a very historic atmosphere!\n\nI was here twice in the past few weeks.  Once for a private party in the enclosed patio room, where the guests were offered choices from a special menu; the second time was to try the regular menu.  I came back the second time since my experience the first time was so good!\n\nThe building has been a restaurant continuously and in the same location since 1861.  This makes it the oldest restaurant in California. The interior decor reflects that and is great and perfectly appropriate, including tin ceilings, and lots of historic photographs on the walls.  When this restaurant first opened, it was on the water front (on a river that snaked to the bay); now the waterfront is over a mile away due to land fill over the last 150 years.   The bar is the original 1861 part of the building.  It has a somewhat crooked unevenly slopped floor; the restaurant staff said that they are required by the city to not fix it since the floor is historic.  Patrons may dine in one of three rooms: the bar room, the main dining room, and the enclosed patio room (originally outside of the original building, but not completely enclosed). In the main dining room, there are several curtained booths for private dining. \n\nThe historic decor is a great setting to the delicious food served by this restaurant.  \n\nCocktails are about $8 each and are competently made and generous. \n\nTo start, everyone is served with bread and a shot of hot clam juice.  I have never experienced hot clam juice before.  I found it to be very good and an appropriate start to the meal. \n\nOn my first visit, I had the cioppino, which was delicious (and a bit messy). The sauce was thick, slightly spicy, and very delicious.  There were many pieces of various fish and shellfish including large crab hunks.  \n\nOn my second visit, I had the Calamari Steak Dor\u00e9 ($16.95). This was perfectly cooked (it is very easy to over cook calamari, but the chef here knows how to do it perfectly, so that it was tender, juicy, and delicious). It is served with a very tasty tiny pasta (acini di pepe) with sun dried tomatoes and snow peas. \n\nOn our second visit, it was right after the Dickens Fair (a few miles away in the Cow Palace), so were were attired in Victorian clothing (I was wearing a top hat, frock coat, ascot, waistcoat, etc), but it fit in perfectly since the restaurant decor is of the right era.  [Other people don't wear Victorian clothing here, but as long as we were wearing it, I felt that this restaurant was the most appropriate place for us to dine after a day in 1863 London!]. \n\nI recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Mike M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-09-16", "description": "Like many of the reviewers I have been going to the Old Clam House for years. But unlike most reviewers I don't think the place has been ruined by the new owners. At least not the clam chowder. It's the only thing I order and is still the best I've ever had. \n\nEvery restaurant I go to (and always those that specialize in seafood) I order the chowder. From my unscientific survey, I must say from Half Moon Bay to the Wharf and everywhere in between, the Old Clam House's is the best around. \n\nWe parked behind the restaurant (in a small alley) and walked by the open kitchen door as we made our way to the front entrance. I sneaked a peek inside the kitchen. A cook was stirring the chowder in a large steaming industrial pot, whistling a tune with a smile on his face. Happy restaurant staff is always a good sign of a decent restaurant. The kitchen floors were spic and span clean. No flies, no rats, no spills, no garbage.\n\nWith the change of ownership, the decor has changed a bit too, as in cleaned up. Literally. Sure, the license plates, old photos and other items of nostalgia has been heavily edited from the walls, but seriously, when was that stuff last cleaned? So some character is gone, but no doubt so is inches of dirt and grime. I do miss the car above the bar and the clam shell bar stools, but other than that, I appreciate the facelift, the new clean red checked tablecloths and modern menus.\n\nIf you're a fan of thick, creamy, dense chowder with more potatoes than clams, OCH's chowder is NOT for you. Their chowder is brothy, light on the potatoes and brimming with clams. Oh so delicious accompanied by hot, fresh Sourdough french bread that's so good it doesn't even need butter (but if you want it, it's provided, nicely chilled). \n\nI LOVE the shot of clam sauce that's served with the bread before your entr\u00e9e arrives. It's like a little preview of what's to come; tempting your taste buds. I'm not aware of any other place that does this. It's unique and delicious.\n\nI ordered a pilsner to go with my chowder. I'm a lightweight so I appreciate the half pint option. The smaller size actually encouraged my husband and I to order additional beers they had on tap to \"taste\" which made the meal a lot of fun.\n\nParking is VERY limited, but as long as you're aware of this, it's not a big deal. The chowder is worth it!! Don't take multiple cars if you're going with a group. Pile into one car. It will make things easier. Try the narrow lot behind the restaurant (which is more like an alley). There might be \"a\" space. Or park along the side street. Be sure not to leave any valuables in the car and lock it up tight. OCH has been on this spot since 1861. The neighborhood around it has changed over the years - a bit rundown and industrial, but don't be intimidated. OCH is on a busy street corner and there's no scary streets to navigate. The entrance is just steps away.\n\nEnjoy the chowder!!", "author": "Jenn H."}

There are great servers who know our orders and take good care of us.  The mussels can't be beat.  Crab Louie is a fave!  The menu changes occasionally (now they charge for bread with dinner?), and the new long-boat dinner dishes are awkward. \n\nBut ... the real reason for the low review is the safety in the area.  My friend's car was broken into recently while parked here.  Tonight we didn't heed her warning and parked in the dark alley behind the restaurant and our car also had its window smashed, all for the thieves to take some things they no doubt can't use.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-25", "description": "Update - We decided to try the Old Clam House again. Saw some photos on line that looked like they spent a good amount of effort in cleaning the place up.  \n\nWell, the only nice thing I can really say about the place is that the remodel they did was nice.  WITH THE EXCEPTIONS of a) they took off 90% of the fun stuff on the walls in the bar and b) they removed the tractor seat bar stools.\n\nThey do not have the large cherrystone clams anymore. We ordered the steamed clams and although it was a more traditional broth, the clams were over cooked. My husband did like his basa with lemon butter caper sauce. I ordered the cioppino but got the pasta with cioppino sauce. \n\nUpside: the prices are lower than they were before. They now have a kids menu at super reasonable prices. They also upgraded the dinnerware. \n\nHonestly, we probably won't go back.  No clam house linguini, no cherrystone clams - those were the 2 reasons we braved the not-so-elegant neighborhood from the peninsula for dinner. \n\nI've down-graded my rating to 2 stars.  Sorry - I liked the old Old Clam house better. \n\nOriginal Review February 2011\nI've been going to this place for over 20 years.   I LOVE this place but I'm afraid the winds of change are blowing.  They are under new management (owners of Calzone's in SF) and they are screwin the pooch by making changes to standard, good old favorites on the menu.\n\nWe had dinner there last night.  We always order the steamed clams. The waitress warned us it's different... said \"there's parsley in it now\".  Hmm there was parsley in it before.  UGH it was the same giant clams but the broth - WAY too salty and it is PESTO that's in the broth.  \n\nOur hearts sank but we kept our hopes up for the rest of the dinner. Only to be kicked in the gut.  I crave the Clam House linguini... that's the reason we braved the storm on a Thursday night to have dinner.  I could see that the red sauce was different.  And it tasted different. I get the half white/red sauce... the white sauce was watery.   Since we had just eaten a ton of crab over the weekend, my husband decided to try the broiled salmon. BLAND. Lovely looking veggies and mashed potatoes that went with.. BLAND.\n\nWhat an utter disappointment.   We gave the waitress an earful. We asked if there were new owner - she said yes.  We asked if there were new cooks in the kitchen.. she said YES! We gave her all our feedback.  She siad the new owners were going to focus on \"higher quality food\".  Holy crap - that's double-talk for \"we're in the biz and know this place could be better\" \n\nTo make matters worse, we couldn't help but notice the original dining room is completely under renovation.  They left the classic tiled roof but I dread the thought of change in a good ol place like this. We usually eat in the bar.  When I asked the waitress if they were going to remodel the bar... she stuttered and said she wasn't sure. I'll HATE it if the remodel the bar.\n\nNew owners of OCH - PLEASE do not try to make the Old Clam House  some swankerffic north beach restaurant.  People don't drive to the bayview/hunter's point for ambiance.  The only thing going for OCH is the food and historical interior.  AND YOU'VE DECIDED TO CHANGE BOTH!!\n\nThere's an old saying - If it ain't broke, don't fix it. You're about to ruin a very good thing.\n\np.s. thanks for power-washing behind the building. That was a highlight of the trip.\n\nGiving 3 stars today hoping that on our next visit we aren't entirely disappointed.", "author": "Hitomi B."}

The mid 50's manager that seated us seemed alarmed that we would not spend enough money when we asked to be able to use laptops in the bar.  He didnt need to worry, the prices were high.\n\nI am sure it takes money to maintain a place like this.  However, the beers are like ball park prices with their $6 small a joke in a restaurant.\n\nHere is how it breaks down, this is a place to try once so you have been there.  But, the food doesnt even live up to Pier 39 Bubba Gump quality and this is shameful at the price.\n\nIf the steamed clams or chowder had just amazing flavors then you could justify an $85 pre-tip bill for three appetizers and three beers.  But the flavor of the food is what you would expect from a TGI Fridays.  \n\nIf you have to go for the experience, get a cocktail and cup of chowder, say you did it, and then have your meal elsewhere.  In the end, it felt like having a cup of chowder at Disneyworld.  You didnt get anything special, you paid high, but the environment was well decorated.\n\nService was prompt but tepid.", "author": "Scott F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-03-09", "description": "I would give them ZERO stars if possible. This is my first Yelp review that I have ever done, that is how bad the service was that I could no longer just sit back and allow restaurants to give crappy service along with mediocre food. \n\nFirst off, I came here 2 weeks ago and the atmosphere was chill and the food was just alright until the bill came. The waitress had overcharged mines and my boyfriend's cards by at LEAST $300 when our bill was only $40. \n\nSo we both got overdrafted and had to pay the overdraft fees on top of being out of those couple hundred dollars for a week and half.\n\nSpoke to the manager and he said there was nothing he could do but that he could give up complimentary meals. \n\n2 weeks later- We return thinking that we would both get our meals on the house. NOPE. The same waitress (that messed up last time) returns to our table to give us our bill, so I was surprised and told her that the manager said that our meals were on the house. She then told us that we would only be able to get one meal for free after arguing with me about the date that I came into the restaurant last time. I tried to tell her that it took more than week to get my money back into my account, and she confronted me to insist that I only came in the week before- which is definitely wrong.\n\nON TOP of while all this is occurring, another customer was also complaining about the service to the manager. I overheard that this customer was unsatisfied with the manager and how he was handling their complimentary coffee and dessert. The customer was trying to explain how unprofessional it is to say you are going to do something, and then not follow through with it. Thus, the manager was not being a man of his word. \n\nAs we were leaving, the customer looked clearly bothered and attempted to reach out to the manager again and the manager just reacted with little to no concern. From what I experienced, the manager seemed to have some prejudice towards certain customers, giving a different quality of service to certain customers.\n\nTherefore, if you want to OVERPAY for mediocre food, with TERRIBLE managerial service, then the Old Clam House is the place to go. Otherwise, don't bother.\n\nTrust me when I say, I'm not too demanding to customer service, I understand how it feels to be working for a restaurant and how frustrating and stressful the job can be, but this experience was just over the top bad management that I had to write a yelp review.", "author": "Cat M."}

If you've eaten crab before, you know you'll eat all you get.  \n\nMy Lady was looking forward to steamed crab, and we did not ask whether that was available.  It is, but if you want it be sure to ask for it.  We didn't and we were surprised.  \n\nWe were seated at mother-in-law's request on the patio, and ordered 2 whole crabs, steamed vegetables, a Caesar salad, french fries (mother-in-law's favorite), and a bottle (3 glasses? Take the bottle.) of Trefethen chardonnay.  OK, the table was packed.  Packed!  And sitting right on the edge was a tempting loaf of good old sourdough bread with butter.  I must have thought about picking up a slice of that sourdough about 20 times.  \n\nThe Caesar salad was good and the steamed vegetables were all right, but the dungeness crab was what it was all about.  2 whole cooked crabs, served on a sizzling platter, drenched in butter, so hot you could feel the heat radiating into your skin.   There it was.  Secret sauce and all.  After the waiter brought out the bibs and nutcrackers, all conversation ended.  We had to break free every morsel of fresh crab meat.  Game on!  \n\nAfter the crab feeding frenzy, the house showed us a game of its own:  a little dessert-only menu popped up out of the waiter's pocket!  My resolve to stick to my diet was decimated.

I still come here occasionally...although I do remember the food being so much more flavorful back then.

I went here a ladies brunch, dinner using a groupon and had dinner after my graduation with the family. The food for the ladies brunch was ok. I ordered the crab alfredo. It was very creamy but definitely was in need of some seasoning....or salt...something.... It was creamy but really really bland.  \n\n The time I used the groupon was great. I ordered the prime rib and it was cooked just right. It was a great sized portion and I really enjoyed it.\n\nAs for the graduation dinner. I ordered the lamb shank which was overall really good. I enjoyed the flavor as did others that were nibbling off my plate, but others that were joining me for dinner did not enjoy their selections as much. I guess their orders were bland and small in portions. \n\nThis place is kind of a landmark, but can be a hit or miss. Things that I love to order which are consistently good are the clams in a pot, clam chowder and crab cakes. \n\nThings that are okay but definitely need a dash of salt are the white cream pastas.", "author": "Krystal T."}

As a native San Franciscan, I've driven by this place for decades but never stopped by.  After seeing a review on SFGate, I decided tonight would be the night.  I'm not sure whom I'm more disappointed in, Mr. Bauer for recommending this place or TOCH for the experience.\n\nI made my reservations via Open Table for 8 pm. En route, I get a call saying I missed my 730 reservation. However, by the end of the message, she had realized her error and said she sees it's for 8. Made me a little anxious that the place would be packed and we would have to wait for our table.  We arrive and not only is the place half empty, but the hostess stand is unmanned.  We stand around for easily 5 mins trying to get someone's attention until a waitress finally spots us and after giving her my name says to go sit over there at the table set up already.  Doesn't even have the courtesy to lead us to our table. We sit there and it turns out she is now our waitress, but doesn't come by to take our order for 10 mins.\n\nNow for me, dining out is the food, service, and atmosphere.  If one is off then the others better be on point to make up for the missing link.  We had the clam chowder (decent, but a little salty), the beet salad and the seafood cioppino.  The portion was generous but the flavor was lacking. The kids had the pasta with tomato cream sauce and it came out a gloppy clumpy mess.  The chicken and fries were ok.  Throughout the meal we had to flag someone down for more bread, more water, the check.  Leaving the impression, that if we didn't, the servers would have just left us to ourselves.  \n\nHaving heard the pedigree of the owners, I had high expectations, so much so that I made reservations at another of their restaurants, Osso Steakhouse this weekend simultaneously when I made the one for TOCH. However, given this experience, I'm having serious second thoughts and might just cancel.", "author": "Dave T."}

It's old San Francisco, it's seafood -- what's not to like? Well as it turned out, quite a lot.\n\nAs others have mentioned, once you are seated, they give you a glass of clam broth. My oh my, this is one tasty little drink. But it went downhill from there. \n\nFirst of all, it wasn't that busy, around mid-afternoon. But even though there weren't that many people there, they must have been very understaffed, because we sat and sat, and waited and waited. Finally someone came and took our drink order. I could see it sitting on the bar all by its lonesome and considered getting it myself, but finally someone brought it to our table. We ordered our lunch and waited again. I think it's pretty reasonable to assume that if two people order one dish each that they will arrive at the same time. But if you assumed that at the Old Clam House, at least on this occasion, you would be wrong. My husband's dish was delivered to the table separately -- no explanation about where mine was, just slapped it down and left. I sat there and looked longingly at the kitchen entrance, hoping mine would materialize. Nowhere in sight. My husband was nearly done when my entree finally appeared. Really bush league service. And the kicker was, it wasn't even that good. I had ordered steamed clams, one of my favorite meals. When it arrived, it looked like a lot of clams. But as I began to take them out of their shells, it became apparent that half of the shells were empty! I'm from Boston and the Cape and grew up digging and eating steamers, I know that sometimes there are empty shells. But there were so many that I swear the kitchen had to have known. Who knows?

He kept telling me that it was a really nice restaurant, but I just couldn't imagine anything close to \"nice\" being on that stretch (or any stretch) of Bayshore.Luckily I was feeling totally bored with my own cooking this weekend and all of the restaurants in the Mission, so I decided to give the Old Clam House a try.\n\nThis was probably one of the best seafood restaurants I have been to in the city. I would say, from what we had, that they stand up to Hayes Street Grill and totally out-do The Fish Market, and are a bit less expensive as well. Here is what we had:\n\nStarters:\n-Delicious complimentary bread and clam juice as we waited for our food\n-Bowls of clam chowder that were incredibly thick and creamy. I, who do not even like clams or any clam chowder at all, was practically licking the bowl. \n\nSides:\n-We ordered a side of Dutch Creamer Potatoes and a side of Swiss Chard. They are large enough sides for two people to share and have some left over.  The potatoes were covered in this delicate crispy skin that tasted like they were pan fried in butter, and the swiss chard was just about the best I've ever had. It was sauteed with bacon, onions and lemon juice and was just perfect. Not a hint of the bitterness that I usually get when I order this in restaurants. \n\nEntrees:\n-The Seafood Cioppino Stew was my boyfriend's pick and he ordered a \"bowl\" size instead of the larger \"terrine\". He was worried it wouldn't be enough food, but couldn't even finish it. His words--the words of a man who is not impressed by much-- \"The best cioppino I have ever had.\" All of the seafood inside was fresh and flavorful.\n-I ordered the pasta with a red pepper and onion sauce with shrimp added. I would give it a 3.5 out of 5. It wasn't as spicy as I thought it would be and could have used more sauce over the noodles. The shrimp and noodles were cooked perfectly though, and tasted fresh. \n\nI was really craving a little Moscato or Limoncello after dinner, but they did not have it on the menu, so that was a bummer. I skipped desert, but the waitress did mention it is all made in-house. Our consensus after the meal was that we would definitely come back to try out more of the menu.

We were seated in a cozy corner away from the ball games on TV and had no problem with multiple conversations.  The attentive, friendly and knowledgable service started with delicious bread and shots of clam juice.  After asking a fair number of questions of our server who was very forthcoming with answers, we all decided on the three course prix fixe menu.\n\nThere is a choice of delicious, meaty clam chowder done with a creamy potato base or a nice salad with very fresh romaine, grape tomatoes, red onions and house vinaigrette for a first course.  Choices for the entree for our party included tangy cioppino, a generous portion of sizzling dungeness crab legs and crab enchiladas.  There were seven other choices available.  Service was timely, but not rushed.  The entrees were delicious and generous enough to be filling but not enough to be gluttonous!\n\nOne in our party decided to skip the desert course and had both the chowder and the salad.  She missed out on delicate tiramisu, tart lemon cake, rich rum cake and fresh strawberry cheesecake.  The desserts are not made in-house, but the waiter told us they are from Bindi, a Milanese bakery that provides wholesale, high-quality Italian desserts to restaurants and clubs around the world.\n\nGroups of six or more are charged an 18% service fee, but the service was worth it.  The prix fixe is definitely the way to go for a complete meal because it's a savings of 30% from a la carte prices with the same size portions.\n\nThe restaurant has been in the same location since 1861 and the decor of historical photos reflects some of that history.

They used to be served with delicious Acini pasta, which absorbed the butter lemon sauce beautifully and enhanced the flavor of the Sand Dabs. Today the dish was served with Gemelli pasta and we were told this would be permanent. So sad! The Gemelli are heavy and flavorless. I won't order the Sand Dabs again. There must be something extra special about a place for us to battle the lack of parking space and traffic. Now I'm not so sure The Old Clam House is worth the hassle.", "author": "Susan A."}

Over the years I conducted much business here for the Union at lunch time.\n\nSo my better half chose to go here for lunch and the first thing that goes wrong is that we get something other than what she had ordered from the bar. We have to go up to the bar because now we can't find the waitress. His response is well thats what you ordered and I can only think how do you know that you were not at the table when we ordered drinks. Customer service? I think not! They were not able to produce the first thing we asked because they said they did not have it although as we looked at the fully stocked bar we noticed some excellent substitutes none of which were suggested by the server.\n\nThe menu is not that good anymore so I would think that the customer service would have to be kicked up a few notches. We were unable to eat what we ordered, and so we packed it up to go.\n\nI would say to the management that folks will have to be taken in the back and reminded that customer service it essential expecially at a time where the place is practically empty.\n\nI hope they survive but it looks bad. Oh did I mention the prices have gone up dramatically. I don't mine spending the bucks but give me something in return.\n\nSpeaking of returning....I don't think I ever will! Big loss for this establishment as I like to eat and entertain out a lot and always take care of the servers. The check gave me the breakdown on tips and I normally leave a minimum of 30% so I left 15% which means the server was hurt by this suggestion oh well thats business.", "author": "Jim S."}

When we were seated (out on the closed-in patio, away from all the TVs inside (we were there on Super Bowl Sunday) where the music was GREAT), the waiter brought us hot clam juice in glasses. I had to ask what to do with it -- was I supposed to sip the hot juice of clam? Because I would! I just needed to know. Yeah, he said, or dunk your bread. I did both, both ways were fantastic and as salty as the ocean. \n\nThe crab was spectacular -- quite literally all the crab I could eat, and I can eat a LOT of crab. My wife says no one has lived until they've seen me covered in butter, eating crab. Usually I am fastidiously neat while eating. I don't like to get my hands dirty. In fact, when I was a kid, I would only eat half a chocolate bar, and then ask to wash my hands so I could eat the other half. \n\nNot crab. Crab, I attack like the Tasmanian Devil attacking a zookeeper (it happens, people: check Youtube). And this was some crab. Delicious. \n\nLala said the steak was good, too. I believed her. The oysters were perfect. The martini was a little weak, but they give you a good amount, so that doesn't hurt. \n\nWe went on a Groupon, but we'll be back just on our own.

My girlfriend and I flew from Vegas and were headed to BevMo to stock up for the weekend. by sheer chance of the luck of the gods we stumbled upon this beautiful old place. The first thing we both noticed where the floors were as crooked and windy as Highway one along the coast. We sat at the bar where the waiter set out with a strange, warm cocktail in shot glasses and hot bread. After one sip of the premium elixir we both knew this was going to be an exceptional experience. Our drink was a mixture of clam juice and potato soup prepared just right. We ordered clam chowder and cioppino (mixed seafood).

The menu was not huge, but there was a good selection of dishes. In the end, we decided on oysters for appetizer, the prime rib and a whole (dungeness) crab. The waiter also served us bread and clam juice, and explained that it was a tradition of that place.\nWe did not have to wait too long for the food to come out. The oysters were fresh and the perfect size, being a oyster lover myself, it was a good start. The prime rib was also perfectly cooked, and came with a side of roasted potatoes that were delicious. The highlight had to be the crab. It came out smoking hot on an iron skillet. Although it didn't look too big, the crab had A LOT of meat, with the special garlic sauce fully infused into the meat. In short, the crab was delicious. \nDespite finishing all the dishes (and cleaning the sauce on our plates), we still found room for dessert and ordered a tiramisu. And although I had no high expectations, it was delicious as well; rich and creamy, the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. \nAll in all, really loved the food. The place started to get crowded around the bar as the evening went by. I could tell that those who were there are regulars, and now I know why. Now I have a good substitute to the overpriced tourist traps of Fisherman's Warf,  Will definitely be back for more of that delicious crab.", "author": "Helen Y."}

Lucky we had a reservation as we were walked right past a dozen or so people who didn't have reservations and they all gave us the stink eye - so long suckers - make a reservation next time you want to eat on a Saturday night at 7:30PM...\nI tried one of their local draft beers to drink - nice and light flavor - we ordered the clam chowder and they make it a little different than I have had any where else - seems like the potatoes were almost pureed into the broth - made for an interesting consistency and a really stand out clam chowder like nothing I've every had before.  Order the bowl - it was worth every bite.   I had the Crab Louis salad for dinner - this was just enough of a meal for me and the crab was very fresh and tasty mixed in with a lot of extras to make it a decent meal.\nWait staff is really fun and other than the table next to us that had one too many drinks that they had to sing along with all the songs that came over the sound system - probably time for them to go home before the one sitting across from me falls out of his seat - we left before that happened, but was only a short amount of time before he passed out - other than that....I will make this a regular stop now...looks like I can go to the bar and just eat there if I want to swing by on the way home from work some night.

I will start by saying the food is great, the atmosphere is nostalgic and I believe the new owners have done a great job with this place, especially with the private booths (you can close the curtains) in the main room. However the service is why I am giving my beloved Old Clam House a 1 star. In the past it has always been friendly, fast, and enjoyable but we got the wrong server last friday. Jonathan was rude, sarcastic and in a way came off plain snobbish. Nothing was wrong with the food and it all came out in a good amount of time but his attitude left a bad taste in all our mouths. He made the meal itself less enjoyable and turned a pleasant evening out into a bad mood. I have a hard time picturing myself going back, which is sad because like I said my family has been going there for generations and we have fond memories, let alone family pictures, at The Old Clam House.

Gone is the old Giants and 49ers memorabilia on the walls.  The place did to get revamped a bit because it was a bit dingy. But it gave it character. They added a indoor patio on the side where it used to be storage. They might want to frost the windows a bit. Don't see the need for everything to be open because there's not much of a view in an industrial area.  We were seated in the patio area even though there were plenty of tables in the bar area. The floor must not be on a even slope because I felt like I was eating down a hill or something. \n\nMenu - It was our first time dining in there since they changed ownership and revamped the menu. The menu looks more pricey than what regular patrons would be used to. We tried the calamari appetizer, Fish and Chips and the Seafood Pasta in spicy ciopinno sauce. The sauce wasn't spicy at all. It had regular and green pasta w crab, clams, mussels, and calamari. The pasta was a bit over cooked and the sauce was a bit bland.  The fish and chips was a very generous in size. It was decent . Not too greasy or overcooked. The calamari was ok.  Nothing too exciting or bad about it. It was garnished with some peppers. Crispy and not to battered. \n\nService: I don't recognize any of the staff and it looks like they revamped that too. Our waitress was good and very attentive. I have no qualms about her or her service. \n\nOverall the food was just ok. I have to somewhat save my opinion till I go here a few more times to find my one favorite item.

Why do I have to come here?  \n\nMy other must-have from the old Old Clam House, the Lazy Man Cioppino is now replaced by the Seafood Cioppino, which is smaller in portion and thicker in the sauce.  While the flavor is good, it's smaller and just...different.  Just not what it used to be.  \n\nThe prime rib was blah at best.  My husband described it as Reno prime rib. I know, we shouldn't expect too much of the prime rib from a seafood joint.  But if they taut it on their wall and their menu, please make it halfway decent.\n\nThe only thing I can praise about the new rendition of this restaurant is the service.  It is definitely better than before.  Too bad... we can't get a satisfied tummy from good service alone.\n\nGoodbye old Old Clam House, who I could count on to have the giant cherry stone clams 365 days a year.  And goodbye new Old Clam House for I will not be returning ever gain.", "author": "Irene T."}

Finally made a reservation for last night and it was packed by the time we got our seats, so make sure you rsvp. We felt a little cramped since we had 4 people and we had our purses and nowhere to put them. They are doing the SF restaurant week so we ordered 4 sets and another dish as well. Sadly our kettle bread and butter was cold, would have enjoyed it much better if either the bread was warm or the butter was softer. I really enjoyed their caesar salad!! (my fav dish of all the dishes on our table) The clam chowder was barely warm and would have been tastier if it were warmer. We were all pretty full from just the starters already so 1 set would have been way enough per person. (we ended up taking out most of the entree) The boneless ribs were very tender, fish fillet was just right but the crab legs were a little disappointing; We imagined it bigger. Desserts were great, only wish the chocolate moose have a thin layer of cake because the portion was really big.\nI also like how the business manager actually reads and reply to most of their reviews whether it's good or bad :D", "author": "Amy Z."}

Step inside the building, and you'll actually feel like you've stepped back in time.  Never had I experienced this in San Francisco...Boston, yes, but not here.\n\nI was lucky enough to read the reviews first and ordered the house specialty, the cioppino.  It came to me in a big bowl, topped with two slices of garlic bread standing on its end.  I was sold on the broth - very light, but had the right spices and was not overbearing.  It came fully loaded with crab, scallops, a couple pieces of fish, and one large prawn.  Down this with the house ale and this lunch had enough food to hold me over till the next day.\n\nWe also had the clambake, which was good but not great.  It was loaded with mussels, prawns, clams, but I thought the broth was uneventful.  The fried dishes on the other tables looked pretty good, so if you're into that, I'm sure you can't go wrong.  Make sure you get the au jus dipping sauce with your sourdough bread, which is the broth from the steamed clams.  It's a healthier alternative to butter, and more flavorful. \n\nBe careful where you park.  There is no on site parking, but if you're lucky enough, you might find a spot in Rape Alley, aka Mugger's Lane, which is right behind the restaurant.\n\nIf I read this book by its cover, I'd have nothing to write, because I would never have ventured into this place.

As soon as we sat down we were brought complimentary clam broth which was delicious. We both got a cup of clam chowder, shared the crab sandwich, kettle bread, and steamed clams. All were really tasty and not too salty which can tend to happen with clam broth. The clams had chunks of potatoes and carrots stewed in the broth which made it super hearty. Make sure you order some bread to soak up that yummy broth.  The crab sandwich tasted fresh and somewhat healthy with avocado & not drenched with mayonnaise.  We went for a weekday lunch and it wasn't cheap, but it was cheaper & less greasy than a place like The New England Lobster Co.  The location is pretty industrial and parking is off the street.

We gave the waiter our Groupon and ordered two crabs and some drinks.  The boyfriend got a blood orange margarita and I got a peach/oj/whiskey cocktail, both of which were good, although mine was definitely worth the money for the amount of alcohol that was in it. They gave us some bread and a shooter of clam juice to dip it in, which I honestly was a little hesitant to get behind, but it wasn't bad. They gave us our drinks in a little dairy farm jar, which was cute and helped in the refilling area.  The crabs came out and they were amazing. Sizzling and covered in garlic herb butter, it was an epic crab experience. The waiter and the guy helping him were both very attentive and friendly, making sure we had everything we needed.\n\nI definitely recommend this place to anyone even though we only had the crab, as it looked like it may not be very popular in the Bayshore area, and it would be a shame to see this place go under in this bad economy.

Charming historic building inside and out.  Old school professional service from our young waiter (efficiently and graciously takes our orders and even recommended the small instead of large calamari appetizer since we already ordered a lot of food) could have upsold us but he turned out to be right - we had a lot left over.  All we ordered was very good. Warm clam juice sounds nasty but was very good and our group had all age ranges and we all liked it.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and we sampled each others as well - all nicely done includes chowder in a bread bowl, clams and linguine, fish and chips, fish fry, sand dabs, crab noodles,  I parked behind the place since it was easy parking with no issues but regarding the ENTIRE San Francisco area I would never park my car ANYWHERE in the city with any luggage or anything of perceived value in sight.  The city is still charming but I feel crime has increased dramatically and the stench of human waste in the streets (none at Clam house or within smelling distance at least)  is increasing.

We have loved their specials as well as their cioppino. We decided to continue the tradition, and came here this past Saturday for lunch.\n\nThe place always starts you off with complimentary clam soup. The soup was delicious, with the clam stock being very fresh and nicely flavored. The waiter got us an extra order because we like it so much.\n\nThe sourdough bread is one of the most sour and crusty in the city. They get it from a local bakery. Unfortunately, it was a bit on the cold side. I do prefer it warm. That being said, I still enjoyed the bread because I am a sucker for sourdough.\n\nCrab Sandwich - The brother in-law ordered this. One of the best crab sandwiches. They use the leg meat, which has a nice texture and was very flavorful. The cheese sauce was delicious, and the hollandaise was also very creamy and rich. The fries that came with the order were great. This was the only good order of our outing, unfortunately.\n\nRib eye - mine and my sister's order: I ordered rare, and my steak was slightly over cooked. Both of our steaks were a bit underseasoned (needed a bit more salt). Our grilled veggies were also only half cooked, and had a still raw taste too them. The potatoes were fluffy and buttery, but because they were buttery, they really stole the flavor from the actual steak. The portion of steak was a decenet size and I was able to make 3 meals out of it.\n\nSeafood Linguine Red/White - these are what my parents ordered. Lots of seafood on these, but the sauce was so bland. My parents heavily seasoned their dishes with pepper and parmesean cheese, and it still tasted bland. They were both very disappointed at how this turned out.\n\nMy dad said he probably won't come back because he felt that it was overpriced for the quality that was served to us. I agree, it will be hard to come back. It feels like this place has changed a lot in a year, though it could just be an inconsistent cook. Who knows. I just know that I probably won't come back either unless I am invited for a party, or if my dad decides to give it one more shot.", "author": "Marc T."}

I agree with previous reviews that this place is not the same as it used to be since they changed owners. Place looked nice, but thats about it in my opinion. I looked at the menu the night before to get an idea of what I might order and that menu said that they had prime rib. SURPRISE! No prime rib. Turns out that the day I went was also the first day they changed their menu. They replaced their prime rib with filet mignon, but what's funny was that they didn't even have any yet. You'd think that if you're going to change the menu, you'd at least have what is on the menu. Anyway... On to the food.\n\nWe started with the fried calamari. It was actually pretty good considering it was gone in about two seconds. It also came with some fried lemons? A question mark because I'm not sure what they were, but they weren't bad. We also ordered a bowl of clam chowder. Only complaint was that this came out to our table about 30 seconds after we put in the order. Okay, not 30 seconds but it came out quicker than it took us to decide on ordering it. Our waitress hadn't even walked back to the kitchen before it was brought out to us. Makes me wonder how long its been sitting. For our last started, we ordered the garlic bread with melted cheese. They brought out plain garlic bread, but brought it back to add the cheese that they forgot. It came back out looking like a fistful of cheese was thrown on top and stuck into the over. If I had known that all they were going to do was that, I would've kept the regular garlic bread. Now to dinner. My boyfriend ordered the seafood cioppino and my stepdad ordered the mixed seafood pasta with spicy cioppino sauce. They both had no complaints. As for my mom and I... Well, we ordered the same thing. We ordered the clam linguini with white sauce. Again, all the food came out fairly quick. Quicker than I would've liked. When it was served, the noodles were not linguini, they were fetuccini. The excuse for that was, \"It depends on what kind of package of noodles we get. If we get fetuccini, then that's what we have.\" No comment on that response otherwise this review will be longer than it already is. On top of the wrong noodles, they weren't cooked properly. They were over-cooked and stuck together. Gross. I like my pasta al dente, thank you very much. Oh and it wasn't even hot. Got it sent back immediately, and just as they should have, they took it off the bill.\n\nI probably won't EVER come back here, but maybe they'll get their act together and actually serve what they have on the menu.", "author": "Katie P."}

It looks like your classic old-timey seafood joint where you won't find any bells and whistles, but the fish and steak will be solid.  To my surprise, the food slightly exceeded my expectations.  True, no bells and whistles, but what they do, they do well.  I had the linguine clam pasta.  The pasta tasted fresh and was cooked perfectly al dente with a rich, but not heavy, butter garlic parsley sauce.  The clams were tiny delicate morsels, clearly fresh, and as a plus, I found no mini grains of sand in my clams!  The sides - creamed spinach and french fries - were excellent.  Nothing crazy.  Just great preparations of solid food.  I was little concerned when the creamed spinach arrived and was still green.  I'm accustomed to my creamed spinach looking light green at most as it's usually doused in cream and butter.  This creamed spinach, by contrast, looked spry.  I tentatively took a first bite and happily got a burst of tender, savory spinach flavor.  The fries are double-fried, so extra crunchy and delicious.\n\nI was really impressed with the service.  I had ordered the crab sandwich for my grandma, but we were served the clam sandwich.  I honestly couldn't remember what I had ordered, I figured I said crab, but it's entirely possible I didn't.

We like to bring out of town guests and friends as we're concerned the patronage may be declining due to the razing of our beloved Candlestick Park and we want this place to continue to survive.  We used to see lots of 49er fans here after our home games but you know the rest of that story.  On our most recent visit we ordered the fish and chips and linguini and clams.  Shot glasses of clam broth precede the meal, a nice touch.  Warm sour dough bread, you have to pay a little for it but it's well worth the paltry sum, is served with soft butter.  Loved both of our entrees but thought the broth with the clams was just a pinch too salty.  The portions are large so be prepared to take home the leftovers, including the bread.

My personal favorites are: the bucket of steamed cherry stone clams and the lazy man's cioppino, which comes with garlic bread.   This and the basket of sourdough bread on the table should feed two just fine, family style.  If there are more in your party, the Chef's special saute, a platter loaded with sauteed shellfish and red snapper over pasta with a side of fresh steamed veggies, provides a good counterpoint.\n\nI also like the hot cup of clam juice they bring you when you first sit down.  The calamari is pretty good, and the clam chowder is just OK, but overall, this is a great place - fresh tasty seafood, unpretentious service, and fair prices.", "author": "Elaine L."}

Looks essentially the same with a good scrubbing done by someone who knew how to treat all of the beautiful wood in the bar.  No more \"saddle\" bar stools, but we saw one on hand, I guess for posterity sake (or perhaps posterior!).  They added \"booths\" to the dining room, but really they are just partitions separating tables/chairs, I was hoping for comfy, cushioned banquettes. \nNow for the food...\nThey still offer up the Clam Broth when you sit but it seemed starchy  - potato starchy with the little bits clinging to the side of the clear glass tumbler.  It was almost as if they strained the chowder base before adding more thickener. And it was more oniony/garlicy than clammy.\nClam chowder - meh.  Uber thick but not creamy.  Tinged yellow rather than the luscious, creamy white we are used to on this coast.\nHubby order the Calamari Steak Dore Lunch Special for $12.95  A fine value!  Came with above mentioned cup o' chowder (note to self, order salad next time) a large, tender, lightly battered, properly cooked piece of calamari but the side, oily ancini pasta with sun-dried tomatoes & snap peas seemed to be a bit of a throw-away.  The on-line menu says it is in a spicy cioppino sauce, it's not. \nI had the Fishwich - HUGE fish sandwich!  A whole fillet of white fish, again properly battered and beautifully fried, served on what seemed like a 1/2 loaf of ciabatta with olive oil slaw.  Served with tartar sauce & lemon on the side.  I must say, one of the better fish sandwiches I've had.  Ate 1st half with bread, 2nd without and I could really see how the olive oil & vinegar slaw complimented the fish.  And, at $9.95 another fine value.\nCocktails...\nChili Mary - their version of Blood Mary. It was ok, a bit much on the Worcestershire sauce but it packed a punch.  \nBlood Orange Margarita -  a bit sweet, not the tart loveliness I expected but again, nice pour on the tequila.\nBe fairly warned though, they're served in a 12 oz tumbler, not a pint glass.

Not too tough or salty, really well executed.\n\nAfterwards there was a Cumbia band from Venezuela playing in the lounge and although we are VERY Anglo, and the crowd there was not, we were made to feel welcome and invited to dance along.

Friendly and attentive. We were expecting a great experience. But there were a few missteps. Our server was Ryan B. who got lost after taking our drink orders as soon as we were seated. We had to ask a second time for water, and iced teas.  And bread. We came in at 1:30 and it didn't seem  very busy, judging by several empty tables. Perhaps they had someone call in sick or had a large group we didn't hear or see. At any rate, after waiting for about 10-15 minutes and feeling abandoned, one of us left the table to hunt down where our server went. Then another search for where our drinks and bread were hiding, after our first request got lost.  Ryan came finally with our drinks and the bread. He apologized. That was fine, but just remember customers will wait a good amount of time as long as they have their drinks and bread to munch on. When the food was served, it was very disruptive. Ryan was again apologetic, saying he was busy with other customers which we would have no quarrel with, but we are his customers too, right? The food we were served was in general good, with a few complaints. Our crab cakes were over cooked and the pickled cucumber(?) served with the cakes tasted dried out in spots which was probably due to being under a heat lamp too long. The cioppino was tasty; however one thing that spoiled the enjoyment was the crab legs were not cracked at all. It was a messy chore to dig through the sauce to get to the crab and then find out it had not the initial cracking. So here you have a slippery leg that hasn't been cracked for easier eating. I also would have wished for a chunkier crab sandwich. I got a finely shredded crab meat mixture with a lot of mayo. I think small crab chunks would have tasted better, and would have justified the price. \nAt the end when he presented the check, Ryan found time to be friendly, and very chatty. I found this especially annoying. I expect service to be gracious and friendly and attentive from the beginning: not at the end when I will be rewarding service given with a tip. Ryan was given a decent tip, only because I was not the one to pay the check. I would have been less forgiving, but we had come with friends and were celebrating Christmas a week early. So no drama. I think The Old Clam House has a fine reputation in terms of food and service. I just hope that they are not resting on past laurels. The staff and kitchen need to never forget what constitutes excellent service and excellent food. Hopefully we just happened to hit on a bad day. We may come back.\n\nUpdate: This is a late posting. I did not see the reply from The Old Clam House until now. I like to post when the business takes the time to write back, and The Clam House did that shortly after my review was posted. Jim sent a very nice message expressing concern with the service issues I had brought up. For that I will add a star, and will definitely come back for another try.", "author": "Diane M."}

Secondly, the dish was sad and small compared to my old favorite, which the waiter said was the same. Thirdly, the clams were terrible. They tasted bitter and gritty. I returned this dish back to the kitchen. I'm so disappointed.\n\nSeafood in Spicy Cioppino Sauce: Again with the cheap Asian egg noodles?!? The dish was again a small portion the size of half a pack of ramen noodles and tasted terrible. The sauce tasted a bit sourer than what a cioppino is supposed to. The seafood was lacking.\n\nAll in All: Don't let their 150 years of tradition bit fool you. They don't have the charm of the Old Clam House nor the delicious food of the past.

We each hadn't been here since we were younger but our memories of the place from then we're fabulous, so when craving clam chowder I thought of this place out of nostalgia.\n\nThe clam chowder tasted like it started as a cup of salt and they just added a touch of the chowder to give it some taste.  The crackers (I had to ask for) were stale.  The menu didn't state that my crab and cheese sandwich came with mayo so I had to send it back to be remade without it.  I wish I would have just cancelled the order all together because even without the mayo, it was HORRIBLE!!!  I took one bite and couldn't eat any more of it.\n\nThe service however was even WORSE!  Our waiter seemed so annoyed when we asked him something.  Even to give him our food order, then we had to call him over to give him our drink order.  When I sent my sandwich back, he didn't believe that the menu didn't state that it had mayo so he actually looked it up before taking it back!  And please...talking on your cell phone in front of your customers is just tacky.\n\nWhen the $50 bill showed up on his bill recently it almost had an anti-yelper creating an account to protest the restaurant.

It's a thing we do every month, taking turns paying each month. The one that was paying this time decided on this place. No complaints from us so here we are.\n\nFrom the outside, it looks like any old building. But when you are in the inside, it looks funky. Sorta like a TGIFridays but without the annoying servers that wear their vests adorned with flair. God, I hate that...\n\nAnyways, we all sit down and ordered drinks and apps. after the server left, this other guy comes over with bread and water and little Chinese tea cups you see in dim sum restaurants. But instead of tea, these things were filled with clam broth. Now, if you enjoy seafood, don't drink this straight because it is SALTY! Use the bread and dunk it in then eat it. Cuts down on the saltiness by a lot.\n\nSo we ordered the Oysters Rockefeller and fried calamari. Both were good. Not overly stupendous but still good. The oysters lacked the abundance of bacon that is usually used to make them and they had some sort of weird cream sauce on it. I remember they were just the oysters on a half shell, bacon, spinach, cheese and breadcrumbs. But maybe each place makes them differently. The calamari was good. Tender and lightly breaded. Cooked really well and not chewy at all.\n\nI ordered the Cioppino. I liked the presentation but the bowl lacked heat. Like it needed a little red pepper flake added to it because the soup or broth or whatever you guys want to call it, it lacked depth. I believe if it had that little kick it would have been better. And adding some hot sauce to it would not have been the same because the hot sauce would did not have the opportunity to cook into the seafood. It's just an add-on flavor. But, nonetheless, it was a huge bowl of seafood. One huge prawn with a copious amount of bay shrimps,scallops, mussels, squid, some dungeness crab and one large clam. It was good but not great.\n\nIn short, it's not all that bad. I would love to give it that extra half star but 3 is the best at the moment. I just can't justify giving this place a 4.

So we go on and order our usual appetizer, calamari.  The plate was literally 2/3rds fried jalapenos and 1/3rd calamari, and the old recipe didn't even include jalapenos.  I then ordered a cup of clam chowder, something they are known to make fantastic.  Took my first bite and had to down the big swig of beer just to get the awful taste our of my mouth.  Tasted like they put some creme, old clams (they were chewey) and celery into a chicken broth and told us it was clam chowder, it was disgusting.  Not wanting to stay any longer if their main courses were also different, we asked if their fettuccine alfredo was still creamy.  The waitress informed us that as long as we paid for extra sauce it should be somewhat creamy and they don't use fettuccine at all, but smaller noodles.  I am not lying, her exact words... Why call it fettuccine alfredo then??  We paid for the appetizers and drinks and left.\nExtremely sad they choose to lie to their patrons and say the menu was the same when they've made so many changes and made it from old and delicious to hippy and disgusting.

My father brought me there as a child and as a native San Franciscan I continued my visits through last week.\n\nI was very disappointed.\n\nWe stopped in for lunch on a weekday, about 2pm.  The place was almost empty--which in fact is a good thing as it gives one an opportunity to see all the memorabilia and photos hanging on the walls.  The menu offerings are expensive considering the casual atmosphere and rather lazy presentations.  Anyway, I went for the Crab Louis, my partner went with the Calamari and a cup of clam chowder.  All were below standard.  The Crab Louis (at $17.50) featured slightly wilted lettuce (complete with brown spots as if it wasn't even reviewed in the kitchen) and 1/2 of a hard boiled egg (guess they needed to reign-in costs) and, most disappointingly, an underwhelmingly small portion of crab.  Making matters worse, the limited crab contained not a single claw piece (that rich, meatly matter).  For that kind of $$, the customer deserves much, much better.\n\nThings were no better for my partner.  Her calamari was heavy and overcooked and the batter had no taste at all.  The same can be said for the clam chowder soup which tasted artificial and lacked any detectable seasoning.\n\nAll in all, the atmosphere is great, but the place is coasting on its unique image and serving way too expensive and underwhelming food.", "author": "Remy M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-01", "description": "Probably the main attraction of The Old Clam House is the interior design and decor, which reflect the fact that this restaurant has been in operation continually since the late nineteenth century. The surrounding neighborhood ain't the best, but somehow this place keeps on going. Ownership is now in the hands of the company that also operates such Bay Area eateries as The Stinking Rose, Salito's, and The Dead Fish, all of which share certain menu specialties, notably an excellent garlic-roasted Dungeness crab. I ordered what was billed as The Old Clam House's original crab cioppino, and I found it disappointing. The broth was fairly bland, and there were too many extraneous ingredients (corn on the cob, carrots, potatoes).  My wife ordered a basic breakfast item (eggs, bacon, and \"crispy potatoes\"), and she enjoyed her meal a lot. The dining room was half-empty and reasonably quiet, but it is a small room with hard walls and low ceiling that likely gets very noisy when full. The adjoining bar also occupies a small room; it WAS full (at mid-day!), and it WAS noisy indeed. Parking exists in a narrow, industrial cul-de-sac behind the building, but given the neighborhood, I'd leave all valuables stashed at home. (At least one other review here on Yelp! mentions smashed car windows.)

We tried to be optimistic to the changes until last night we went for cocktails and dinner. They only carry one domestic beer and both cocktails/beer have gone up in $$$.\n\nThe Menu...Don't look for the Old Clam House favorites, Cioppino, Vongole Linguini with Clams, Prawns Flamingo, Calamari it's all new menu. No calamari in a  seafood restaurant ? What's up with that??\nWe ordered the \"Sand Dabs a la Calamari\" fried small strips of fish, the is dish was ok the serving was small and not worth the $9.95. The Clam Linguini was a concoction of bland pasta in a broth no taste at all, we actually returned this and settled for a crab sandwich, .Crab on a baguette with four slices of avocado, red onion ask for mayonnaise, as you need something to complete it. The Crab in their \"secret garlic sauce\" is okay, the sauce was graining couldn't tell if it was garlic powder or what, as there were no signs of fresh garlic. Keep in mind it is not the cooks,, they are the same cooks. It's the new recipes that they are being forced to use.\n\nIt is no longer the place you can hang out seeing familiar faces, the new management have succeeded in catering to a new clientele, not of this neighborhood with their new menu to suit a different palate. Unfortunate for the people that have been going there for many, many years and expecting good quality seafood in a casual atmosphere. You can keep your \"toy box tomatoes\" and tasteless food. The menu is pretentious just like the management that they are bringing in from their other venues to oversee the old staff. The menu is the same for all their seafood restaurants, The Old Clam house is now part of a chain.

The Clam House Pale Ale on draft is a superb complement.\n\nBut mostly, it's about the clams, clams, clams.  They are delicious and served in myriad ways - steamed, escargot style, with linguine, etc.  If you're not into clams (maybe not the spot for you), the crab preparations are similarly divine.  Crab cocktail, broiled dungeness with the works, you name it.\n\nHeck, if you're a salad person, the arugala and ceasar salads are fantastic.

The car hanging over the bar is gone.  I liked it but it would no longer fit w/the upgraded appearance of the bar/restaurant.  Most of the old photos and memorabilia are still there, but they have been cleaned up and some of it has been culled out to make the walls look neater and less \"kitschy\" which is not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nHowever, all of the tables now sport white table clothes and the dining room on the left (as you enter) which was previously very dark and dingy is now bright and inviting.  They also added a side patio  on the right pat the bar dining area along the side street with very attractive etched/frosted windows but they did the work w/o a permit and it is currently closed.   They hope to get the permit issue worked out soon.\n\nThe menu has also changed significantly and prices have also seemed to have risen.  My GF and I decided to order a combo of plates to share: Seafood Cioppinno (similar but not the same as before), Steamed Clams, and Roasted Shrimp.  They still serve great sourdough bread w/warm clam broth, which is still very tasty.  The cioppinno comes in an Italian tomato sauce broth w/2 crab legs w/a part of the heart attached, mussels, manilla clams, calamari, shrimp and a couple pieces of thin sliced garlic bread.  I think some fish is supposed to be in it too but I didn't notice any.  The cioppino seems a little smaller than before and the crab was a bit overcooked but the rest of the dish was fine.  The steamed clams were actually cherrystones; there were a lot of them and they were very fat and meaty.   The clams also came w/a couple of thin slices of toasted garlic bread and the broth was delicious!  The roasted shrimp are new and we got the medium order w/24 of them served on a hot metal platter covered butter and garlic.  If it wasn't buttery enough, there was an additional metal container filled w/melted butter to dip the shrimp, clams and other seafood in.  The shrimp were well cooked -- not too much or too little.  There was some shell to deal w/but it wasn't a problem.  All in all this was a  delicious meal -- much better than I experienced at the Clam House previously.\n\nService was provided by Andrew who had to work the entire room by himself for awhile.  He was very polite and as attentive as he could be considering all of the tables he had to serve.  Add a $6 glass of Anchor Steam and the tab was \"only\" $61 (before tip)  for a very filling meal which seemed reasonable considering all of the food we received.  We were both stuffed.  \n\nSo, my opinion of the Clam House has changed.  Can't say that I'm a fan of the newly remodeled restaurant yet, but it is definitely better than before and is now IMHO \"A-Ok.\"   If you haven't ever been there or haven't been there in awhile, check it out.", "author": "Martin C."}

Crunchy and quite flavorful.\nThe Prawns Flamingo, was almost kind of like an alfredo, loaded with 6 huge prawns and lots of shrimp. It was creamy but not too rich and I was able to taste the seafood.\nThe other dish, that mixed seafood with angel hair in tomato sauce was really good too.

We were however sadly disappointed. We were seated in a booth, and brought shot glasses of clam juice. What we were supposed to do with these we were clueless. The waitress finally came over and we asked her were we supposed to drink this and she looked at me funny and said it is clam juice like we were supposed to know what were looking at. Later we saw that people were served bread and they dipped their bread in it. We were not served bread however. My boyfriend ordered the crab sandwich and there was very little crab in it and the hamburger bun it was served on was dry and falling apart. I got the fish and chips and the chips were good and I was pleasantly surprised that the fish was not battered and fried, which was a nice, light alternative. The waitress never came back to the table to see if we were okay or if our food was okay. We left very little tip sad to say. Lastly, were charged $1.44 for a government fee of some sort. That was the first I have ever seen that. We were not impressed and will not go back.", "author": "Carroll L."}

Really guys this place has a average rating of 3.5 stars, do you guys not have taste buds or had really good seafood ever before?  First of all this place was really busy, we sat down and ordered, the calamari came out super fast and it was fairly decent, so we were off to a good start (well except for the fact that one of the bus boys that brought our oysters flung the plate around so fast that all of the water/juice landed on my bros lap and he didn't even say sorry).  Then the shit hit the fan, we waited maybe 45+ minutes for our entree.  My mom order the rib eye medium rare and it came pretty well done and the mash that accompanied it was clearly from a box mix.  My cioppino was full of nasty and old seafood.  The crab tasted like licking the freezer.  My bro had the clam bake which was full of sand and unopened dead clams.  I wish I could say something about the waiter but we didn't see him the whole night, he never asked us if we were ok or got refill on drinks.  This meal took us close to two hours to complete and it was about $114 (totally not worth it).  This place is garbage and I have no idea why it was packed!  Please help me understand.

I ordered the cioppino and the seafood was as fresh as can be.  We also ordered the pesto clam liguini and the clams were huge, not puny like how other restaurants serve it.

The new menu has more meats than seafood and you actually have to look for clams in their dishes (a little ironic since the name of the restaurant is \"the old clam house\").

The clam juice and parisian bread that you are given upon arrival is a nice start. The clam chowder is a must here. I always order the cup, because the bowl is too big for me! I think this establishment must have changed hands during the past few years because the last time I ate there, the food was not as great as I remembered. They took the popcorn shrimp off of the menu, which was a huge downer for me. The shrimps were always fresh, juicy, lightly battered and they melted in your mouth! Why would they take them off the menu?", "author": "Yvonne C."}

The service, on the other hand, is hit or miss. I've had great service and I've had servers with nasty attitudes. Nasty enough to stop me from going back. The last straw was, for a period of time, they were closed for remodeling. I wanted to go eat there and since it's out of the way I decided to give them a call to make sure they were open. So when they answered, I asked them politely if they were opened and the person who answered had a really nasty attitude and answered yeah. Judging by the tone of voice, this person thought I was a complete idiot and that it was the dumbest question. Needless to say, I ended up not going that night and have not stepped foot in there since.", "author": "Diane M."}

The old clam house had many things going for it, but this change is a welcomed one. Lets start with decor. It seems as though they are going to try to bring its essence back as this is a historical place. A lot of the pictures, sports memorabilia, and the potpourri decor have been eliminated. It is now just he beautiful original building being polished up. I ordered the steamed clams and the broth was tastier. The added cheesy garlic bread was prime for the dipping!  I llke the way you can order the fish prepared with their various toppings.  Congratulations, my friends and family are there.. at least twice a month if not more!

I love seafood, and I loved everything I had here.  I sat at the bar, and really enjoyed chatting with a couple of the people who work here.  Especially the bartender, Adele; she was polite, friendly, efficient, and helpful in every way.  They had quite a few options of draft beer, and I tried two, but unfortunately they were not too cold.  I think they need to work on getting the thermostat turned up where the kegs are kept.  Other than that, absolutely everything else was just great.  The sour dough bread (which they give you to dip in their home made clam stock) was delicious.  I ordered a Prawn Cocktail that was so fresh, it was prepared after I ordered it.  I've never had tastier, plumper, more perfectly cooked shrimp!  It was so good, I got \"on a roll\" with wanting to try other things on the menu.  It soon became a \"seafood feast\".  I had oysters on the half shell which were big, tasty and \"perfect\".  This was complimented by their cocktail sauce which had a healthy dose of horseradish.  I ended with the most delicious Crab Louie Salad.  This salad was \"off the hook\".  I use this phrase when things can't get any better for me.   The salad had tons of delicious ingredients like tomatoes, boiled egg, cucumber, carrots, etc., but mainly an incredible amount of fresh crab meat.  It was so good, that all I had to do was squeeze a couple of lemons over it.....none of that Louie dressing!   I did taste it though, and it was your basic thousand island, good and fattening.  All in all, this was a great spot, and I'm glad I found it.  The fact that it's been around since 1861, they've had a chance to get things right.  HA.  I'll be back.

It at least had some flavor of wine and garlic. It had no grated cheese on it and they did not offer any. I guess this is the new economy?

After the waitress told me that the 'paella' is actually a rice-shaped pasta that she doesn't prefer in this dish, I ordered it with linguine. Linguine and clams; a classic, right? Not here. The spinach linguine (didn't order spinach, that's just what they served), was undercooked. Not al dente, but seriously needed another minute or two. About 75% of the small clams were empty! Just shells. Seriously. Leads me to believe they're sitting in a pot for a long time and the clams are sitting at the bottom of that pot. Don't they notice when they plate the clams that they're mostly just shells? The sauce was heavy and overpowered the dish. The few clams that made it in were completely lost in the sauce. They threw a few canned black olives in which did nothing for the dish. I honestly haven't had a meal this lackluster in years, and certainly not in San Francisco. Super disappointing to go to a seafood restaurant and get such a bad seafood dish. My son went here last week and said his meal was bad, but since he ordered a Philly cheesesteak, I figured it was because he didn't order what they're good at. From my experience, The Old Clam House isn't good at seafood either. Spent $40 for basically a mediocre bowl of linguine and one glass of wine. Will definitely not be back.", "author": "Julie T."}

We ate there recently after many years and were very disappointed. The clams were rubbery, the calamari was too deep fried and the clam chowder was not good. Go somewhere else for decent seafood in the city.", "author": "Frank Z."}

I ate a shrimp salad that was like the ones in the 50s very raw in presentation.  The service was terrible and there were only three of us in the entire restaurant.  The waiters seem to ignore you if you are not a regular customer.  It is a place for yee old crowd.  Not again for me. Juanito", "author": "john h."}

Nevertheless, I want to go back and try the clam chowder and oysters. Also something neat that my friend and i experiences was chicken broth in a tea cup, it was also served with bread, so we just assumed that it went together.  yummy all around.", "author": "Olivia W."}
