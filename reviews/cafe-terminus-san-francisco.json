A limited menu and a bit hit or miss at times.  Quite reasonably priced for the FiDi though.\n\nBlueberry Muffin: Felt like something out of a Seinfeld episode.  The muffin top was pure heaven and the muffin bottom was kinda nasty.  The top was so airy and had a great crust on the portions exposed to the oven.  Only downside of the top was that not many blueberries rose in there.  Meanwhile, the bottom had a lot of blueberries, but the dough was off.  Like it was a tad under cooked.  I wonder if that's because it had such a wide circumference.  I only had a few nibbles before giving up.  Thankfully the large muffin top was quite filling.\n\nCiabatta Bread: I was skeptical at first.  It looked like a lunch sandwich that happened to have cream cheese on it.  Turned out I was being too bagel biased; it was delicious!  First of all the cream cheese wasn't spread, it was in thick slices that were just as creamy as a spread but in a larger portion.  The crispy bacon and ripe tomatoes were a very nice flavor and texture contrast.  And the ciabatta roll itself was chewy and had  a nice crunch, so it was bagel-like, except not as dense.\n\nRoast Beef Sandwich: Felt like there was too much lettuce on this and it wasn't even good lettuce.  The roast beef was tasty enough; better than Subway quality but not as good as joint that specializes in it (e.g. Top Round).  The bread was decent; don't think it needed to be toasted though.  I enjoyed the creamy horseradish, but felt like this sandwich was missing cheese (bleu would have been perfect).", "author": "Adam B."}

Had a lunch once and it was a tuna salad that literally had one piece of tuna that was one square inch large.  Went back and they gave me a new one, but still it was annoying. \n\nGot a breakfast burrito this morning, it was a good price, but pretty poor quality.  The tortilla, cheese, and bacon were just thrown in the microwave, and then some eggs that had obviously just been sitting there were thrown on top.

It looks like a cafe from the outside with chairs lined along the window, and a bar from the inside. Once you go in, there's music and a big bar with a great alcohol selection. \n\nCocktails are $12. I ordered El Cholo (with mezcal, pineapple, and lemon juice) and loved it!

I thought this might be one of my regular sports.\n\nSecond time, it's 1:30pm this past Wednesday. I wait at the bar for a few minutes but nobody comes. So, I sit down with my friend who arrived a few minutes earlier. She told me her chai tea was extremely spicy. I tasted it, and, although I love spicy food, it was bordering on undrinkable to me. So, we go back to the counter, and, finally, the lady comes up from the back after I waved. I asked if we could get another drink that's no so spicy, and she refused. She said all customers prefer it that spicy. I have trouble believing that every other customer prefer habanero chai tea, but, okay. So, I asked if we could get a coffee instead, because my friend can't physically drink it. She said that they are out of coffee, and only had coffee for cold brew. So, I asked if we could replace it with that, and she said, only if we paid for it.\n\nSo, 1:30pm, no coffee, and no chai tea, not to mention being treated extremely rudely, we left. I thought I'd found another regular spot for our weekly coffee, but instead, I will never come here again. My friend's stomach was still hurting by the time we got to another cafe.\n\nSo, Cafe Terminus. To save on the price of 10 cents worth of coffee, you lost two customers forever.

Mine was a deep purple stew of oats and fruits.

It looked like the egg brkfst options rotate based on what the kitchen wants to prepare each day.

The bartender was very professional and knowledgeable about his absinthe.  We watched him do this thing and he was eager to show off his skills.  We felt like we were getting a private tasting and were really entertained Top notch, fella! And man, that absinthe was intense.\n\nThere was some sort of tech company after party going on so it was louder than usual (according to the bartender). We got pretty intoxicated and had a great time.  Would love to come back on a quieter evening.  Parking could be an issue for some drivers.", "author": "Trish P."}

Things got kicked off with going to illy, and then it sort of escalated into wanting to take on a new place a few mornings out of the week to find a spot that has the best latte.\n\nCafe Terminus happens to be right across the street from my office, and if you walked by, you'd never guess they serve coffee and breakfast items at 8am.  Terminus is basically a one-stop shop for people like me: coffee/breakfast in the AM, lunch items at 12pm, and cocktails/beer in the PM.  So basically, YOU NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE!\n\nI haven't gotten around to trying the lunch or been by for a cocktail, but their latte was delish.

Don't you get all smug with me. You try writing 2,595 reviews and living up to an unearned reputation for eating everywhere. Yes, everywhere. No, I haven't eaten everywhere. Now look, I've had a sandwich at The Sentinel a few times, especially since it's usually located near where I've worked the past five years (review: http://bit.ly/19jetbn). I've also tried Leary's other spot, Golden West in Trinity Alley (review: http://bit.ly/1gIE4U0), and of course, I've had a few libations at House of Shields because well, who doesn't have a drink at House of Shields? (review: http://bit.ly/1gIEaer) But Jamie W. made me aware of their new spot near where the California Street cable car begins...or ends depending on where you're going.\n\nHe and his partner Eric Passetti sure keep busy because they've already opened another spot in the Tenderloin, Trocadero Club, before I even got a chance to jot down this review. We decided to go there for an after-work drink which is not Jamie's usual way of spending a weeknight evening. So I figured I should take advantage and  treat us to a round. It's a pretty compact spot with just a couple of tables for groups and the bar and a couple of counters along the perimeter (photo: http://bit.ly/17SYuae). It was a pretty quiet scene that night and the two guys at the bar barely acknowledged us after handing us the paper with the cocktail listing on it. Jamie was by-the-book and ordered the Citizen's Committee, an apt beverage for him since he is so civically minded. It was a smooth mix of gin, pastis, orgeat, mint and lemon (photo: http://bit.ly/1hEMjlg). Very Mad Men, very white-collar with cufflinks-type of drink.\n\nI decided on my standby, a Pimm's Cup which they didn't mind making off the menu with a little ginger ale (photo: http://bit.ly/170UMbE). Cocktails are a flat $10 each. It was all fine except the tall ceilings caused an echo effect that made the unexpurgated guffaws of the portly woman fifty feet away from me sound like she was yelling in my ear. Still, I was so entranced by their simple lunch menu (photo: http://bit.ly/1aDVsks) that I came back two days later and ordered the $9 \"Salvador Style\" Pork Shoulder Sandwich with Citrus, Napa Cabbage and Mint. It was served in a soft kaiser roll slathered in mayo, so I was a happy camper (photo: http://bit.ly/19je4WA). With a $2 bag of kettle chips and a $3 glass of lemonade, it started to add up, but the pork was fork-tender like something you'd get at a barbecue takeout. So indeed, it is like The Sentinel meets House of Shields, and that's not a bad marriage if Leary is the justice of the piece.\n\nFOOD/COCKTAILS - 4 stars...decent drinks and even better lunchtime options with the Leary signature treatment\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a rather small space, not that inviting. probably crowds up quickly\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...a bit of a ho-hum on behalf of the servers here, could work on treating everyone as nicely as they do with pretty girls\nTOTAL - 4 stars...this terminus doesn't feel like the end", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-20", "description": "Some see this is as the end of the line, others will see it as the beginning. Cafe Terminus is the beginning, the end and the well-ridden line of bars, cocktails and cafes in San Francisco. Located right at the core of inner downtown is a bar cafe that captures the current times, along with an ode to the history of classic cafes in this city. Some cafes here are different than what you'd suspect in the name. It's not just about a place for a quick cup or a morning drop by, or a place where you pop up tablet and post up for three hours after spending three bucks on a cup. Instead, this type of cafe invites people to linger over a bar, over coffee & tea, too, along with being upfront about being a bar. \n\nOne aspect of the bar + restaurant industry in a major city to take advantage of is that the industry has serious professionals -- restaurant, hospitality groups and cocktail consultants. Cafe Terminus is from the Dennis Leary Group. You'll recognize them from the long-running, now-shuttered Canteen, the breakfast and lunch nooks of Golden West and The Sentinel, along with an upcoming bar Natoma Cabana, and the current Trocadero Club. Here they're capturing all aspects of their trade: breakfast, lunch, catering options, coffee, teas, and a well-crafted full bar. \n\nI can smell the absinthe. I can taste the Ricard and pastis. And the afternoon or lunch champagne. Or, all of it all at once.  The focus on afternoon aperitifs for their cocktail menu, including Ricard, pastis, absinthe and a drink called Death in the Afternoon, made for 4pm, keeps it straight forward with absinthe and champagne in a coupe cocktail glass. If you ask me, they're not trying to do too much, they're doing going beyond the standard, and executing it really well. \n\nA heavy-trafficed pit stop for tourists on the cable cars, and the suits on fly by lunches, and happy hours for all. The not so secret aspect of Terminus is they're open 'til 2am, and in this neighborhood that goes a long way when you want a classic late night in, of all things, a quiet downtown. Like 1964 Manhattan. One thing to embrace in San Francisco is that our population is in fact sparse for a major city. There are more bars per capita here than other major cities, which means sometimes you can find an establishment like this late at night to linger alone, on a date, after a late night of work. You can pony up here in denims or a dark-pleated suit. For the beginning of your day, for along the daily work train, or to end the days in a high ceiling-ed, dimly lit, modern space to begin it all over again.", "author": "Jon A."}

But it's still really tasty, with chopped up kale, toasted chickpeas, goat cheese, pumpkin seeds as well as golden raisins to cut through the acidity of the dressing.  They also cut the roll that comes with the salad in half.  Though the roll is somewhat stale, maybe from sitting around all day, we didn't really need it to round out our half of the salad, it's that filling.\n\nOne thing to mention:  They will serve you your food in a disposable container whether you eat in or have it to go.", "author": "Yvette F."}

Apparently it is a snobby establishment with barely enough room to stand at the bar let alone enjoy a drink (its tiny, think linen closet).\n\nAfter being turned down a simple shot we asked what beers they had on tap, the reply, \"It depends what is your taste for beers.\" - How does it DEPEND? On what? You have it on tap or you don't.  \nI don't care I just want to know what you have on tap!!!\n\nWe did not order a beer and then asked what about their specialty cocktails. Again an annoying pompous answer from a bar tender who thinks their craft is excellent while they are really just helping me get drunk.\nHis answer, \"Depends on your pallet.\" OMFG STFU just give me a drink!!! \n\nWe then ordered three separate \"specialty cocktails\". They all sucked, in fact they were terrible. They all had no flavor besides an overwhelming Anis flavor (black licorice).\n\nNeedless to say this place is great.... I mean TERRIBLE. \n\nalso it is a little overpriced for a cocktail ($12 for a cocktail is too much, especially with happy hour prices around the area, the ambiance is not nice either).", "author": "Dakin G."}

Duck in for a quick drink and a coffee on the way to work and be on your way. \n\nWe arrived at 1:30, past the FiDi lunch rush. Unfortunately, all of the salads and the sandwich I wanted to try were sold out. So we opted for the Vietnamese style pork sandwich and the BBQ eggplant. We took our takeout and headed to nearest park to enjoy our lunch al fresco. \n\nUpon opening our take out containers, we realized we had been given the roast beef rather than the Vietnamese pork. I'm not sure how that miscommunication occurred, but it did. Instead of walking the few blocks back and demanding the sandwich I ordered, we decided to dig in and eat the roast beef, which was really good. Those smoked onions made it for me.  \n\nThe quality of sandwiches stands up to Denis Leary's other sandwich joint, the Sentinel.

There is still no signage anywhere, just a series of printed sheets outlining the simple menu, sandwiches and ceviche.\n\n I ordered the Cuban, because Cuban sandwiches are awesome. We got a 'take' on the classic Cuban, no press marks here. The bread was unbelievably light, fluffy, yet still rich. The pork shoulder was cooked well, the ham and cheese performed admirably, but the toppings is what makes this sandwich special. Mustard and horseradish provide a burning kick to the nose. Not heat, but that unique 'tear gas' burning sensation provided by horseradish and wasabi. Unexpected, and not wholly to the benefit of the entire package. The bread and butter pickles were an interesting choice over the more popular, snappy and sour dill, but it worked. They set the sandwich apart.\n\nWe also received complimentary brioche, or again, their 'take' on brioche. Imagine french toast with a crunchy, toasty outer shell, of course, dusted with powdered sugar.\n\nAfter being on an extremely low carb diet, I broke it here.

I asked if their breads have seeds on them, since I'm allergic, and was told yes.  I asked if all their sandwiches have seeds on them, and was also told yes.  So I ordered a salad.  It was fine, nothing spectacular.  One of my friends then sits down with the cuban sandwich - clearly without seeds.  That would have been helpful to know.  So, based on inaccurate information, I had a less than amazing salad for $11 and I'm still hungry.", "author": "Michelle C."}

The dressing is delicious, the mushrooms are smokey and the kale is fresh and crunchy. Perfection! I'll be back for after dinner drinks some time very soon.", "author": "Steve J."}

Cocktails and service were excellent. They have a few very interesting drinks with Absinthe and Chartreuse. The location is really convenient. Decor-wise they try and have it feel like a euro train station feel with both coffee and cocktails with minimal smart furniture centered around the bar. I would definitively go back.", "author": "Jake T."}

He seemed less than impressed to make me a drink after after sitting there for 5 min waiting for him to acknowledge me.  Then I had to ask for a menu and he sighed... When I got the menu and asked for a drink he wasn't sure he could make it...I pass this place everyday and thought why not...now I know why not.", "author": "Meredith A."}

I prefer a mom and pop, but this spot...this spot right here has blown my mind. I work in downtown SF. I'm not going to spend $5 bucks a day in coffee, so I wandered down California to find a non imposing breakfast sign & I went in. Cafe Terminus is my new best breakfast/lunch spot of SF. The coffee is real good but what got me was the small but enticing menu. Everything is made in house & the egg sandwich with chorizo & caramelized onions on a sesame brioche bun was exceptional. I shared it with a co worker,who entail went back for lunch & brought back their roast beef sandwich. The mustard on it was spicy & flavorful. I haven't stopped in for happy hour yet, but there is always a crowd in there. Yes, they have a full bar as well. The space is not that big. They have a few tables( I think they can fit a bit more) that are normally full. You would never think that this full functioning bar had a simple but outstanding menu.", "author": "M G."}

Terminus reminds me of the caf\u00e9s in Italy; walk in, grab a drink/coffee/snack at the counter, enjoy the ambiance, and go about your day. Such a great concept. Stopped in for breakfast and grabbed oatmeal-chock full of delicious fresh fruit and totally reasonably priced. Friend had the coffee cake, which was also delicious and fresh. As we left, they were hanging the lunch menus... honestly I wished I could stick around for lunch. I'll definitely be back!!!!", "author": "Lauren S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-23", "description": "This spot is a welcome refuge for service industry folks as well as throngs of thirsty young urban professionals downtown. The service is welcoming and professional; they hustle but remember your name and are quick to make conversation or give you a chuckle. The cocktails are inspired and reasonably priced. The drink menu is equal parts foreign delight, booze-nerd and old school classic. The location is comfortable and clean, the floor-length window/doors that open at either end of the bar create great airflow and the music is loud enough for you to hear and appreciate the eclectic mix without being obnoxious to the point of obliterating conversation. Terminus is a great spot that will no doubt become an institution in it's own time.", "author": "sarah s."}

I've been trying to go as frequently as possible before word spreads and they have a line out the door every day. The Cuban is top notch, as is the gin selection. Whatever Eric recommends off the menu that day (it changes daily), just go for it. He has yet to disappoint!", "author": "Sebastian A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-10", "description": "My girlfriend and I purchased a HowAboutWe date for an absinthe tasting and sandwich and I specified the date I wanted 2 weeks in advance. However, Terminus never confirmed and HowAboutWe never notified me of anything so I show up thinking all is well and good only to find out that they don't have my name, but that doesn't matter. The owner was very apologetic and although the place was super crowded and busy they still were willing to give us the sandwich and the tasting, and also included a free absinthe cocktail which was really good. The service was really good also, there was only 1 bartender and the owner working in the front and they both periodically checked in on us to see how we were doing. Furthermore, the food was really good. I would definitely come here just for sandwiches on my lunch. Don't expect to come here and get a super divey drink like a long island though. They straight up told one person that they wouldn't make it for him. Twas funny.", "author": "Adam Y."}
