Taco Tuesday had $2 tacos, $2 tecates, and $4 margaritas. Tacos were literally just meat and grilled onion which is great and totally fine because they are $2! But the margaritas were the best part. Service is terrible. They had one server and one bartender on Tuesday night where they are offering insane specials. Drinks would take 20-30 minutes, even for beer! \n\nFriend went back last week and margaritas have gone up to $6 and still has the same terrible service. It's a pass for me.", "author": "Whitney P."}

So she brought me instead. The first thought we had when we stepped in: \"The music's too loud,\" she said, echoing my unspoken sentiments. Turn down the music at least 10 decibels and I can add a star.\n\nThe food: We got three happy hour specials: tacos dorados, pico de gallo with chips, and buffalo wings. The tacos dorados were fine. Rolled up with a little bean dip, they were crunchy and sabrosa. Probably the best of the three dishes. Pico de gallo was not pico de gallo, but it sounds better than calling it what it actually was: chopped tomatoes. No cilantro or lime juice, and very little onion. Buffalo wings were standard. Service was very average.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Let's start off by stating that I came on a Tuesday or Wednesday night, so it was guaranteed to be low key and fairly empty. No issues with the service, the cleanliness of the restaurant, or the drinks. In fact, my margarita was fantastic. It was the food that really disappointed me. \n\nMy boyfriend and I got there early enough that we were able to take advantage of the happy hour menu. We ordered some nachos and then shared a plate of fajitas (not on the happy hour menu) for our dinner. The nachos were over toasted, as if someone forgot and left them in the oven for too long. Some of the chips were a little burnt, and we paid extra for chicken and there was barely any on it. Plus, all the toppings were splattered right on top, so it seemed that after the first third of the nachos, you really didn't have anything other than tortilla chips left. \n\nWhat really got me though were the fajitas. Fajita meat should be cut into strips with cooked peppers and onions on the side. the peppers and onions were pretty much raw and the fajita meat was cut into tiny pieces mixed into the peppers and onions. It's as almost as if they didn't want us to find the meat or notice how little of it there was! For what we paid (even with the happy hour special), it was too much for the quality and amount of food. Definitely walked away disappointed.", "author": "Sally Y."}

They took 40 minutes to come out and only after a friend asked the waitress where the guac was...it tasted fine but it was literally 6 chips. $12 for 6 chips? No thank you.\n\nStill waiting...at that 40 minute mark the waitress comes by because she needed to clarify something about our order from when we arrived, not even mentioning the wait or that our food will be out soon (this was pre-chips so we were hangry and confused since the place was literally empty) \n\nThe Food: Finally came out! Yay! The eggs looked like a kids science project gone wrong and they managed to burn pancakes...Really how do you burn a pancake...(a $15 pancake, bacon, egg plate too)\n\nIf you like terrible service and food that a 6 year old could cook better, come here.

It was a good time but I was underwhelmed. Not sure if I just had high hopes for it after seeing it Instagram, or what. I felt catfished. every photo I've seen of it, it looks so fun, but when I got there the biggest impression I got, was that it looked kinda sad. \n\nWe came in around 8:15. Half of the tables were sat. The bar was about half empty. We were sat by hostess immediately. \n\nThe waitress was nice and attentive. \n\nWe had passion fruit margaritas. They were delicious!\n\nWe ordered chips and salsa to start (basic alert). The 3 different types of salsas were yummy. \n\nFor our entree, we basically each ordered 3 tacos. \nI had the braised short ribs, fish, and steak. \nI was looking forward to the braised short ribs the most, but was the most disappointed by it. Although there was a lot  of meat on it, it was super dry and hard to enjoy. The fish was good, I didn't love it but I liked it a lot. The steak taco was definitely my favorite one. It was delicious. \n\nAt around 9:50, they told us that at 10pm they would have to take our table and chairs away, which was fine with us. At around 9:45ish, it slowly started filling with people who were out for drinks and dancing. We left shortly after that, but I'm sure it's a great place to go out to with friends on the weekends for a late night.", "author": "Tati C."}

Honestly this entree was delicious.  Lots of avocado and the eggs were perfect.  The bacon really made it complete!

The seats at the U-shaped bars are welcoming to solo diners. \n\nWhat a coincidence that it was Taco Tuesday on the day we came for their happy hour! That means: $3 tacos and $7 Tommy's margarita! We each had 2 margies (always with salt on the rim!) so we were set. I had the taco de pescado (seared fish, grilled pineapple, avocado salsa) and the taco de cameron (shrimp, chile de arbol, avocado, mango) both were nicely sized, but the flour tortilla was served at room temperature. However, given the price for HH, basically $1.50 each taco =150 pennies, I ain't complaining! :-)\n\nIt was also ironic that when I came here, it was my 3rd day in a row having Mexican food #fattystatus but whatever!

The only reason I felt I should pay attention to this was because the guy looked at me and said \"no problems, only opportunities\" as he groped this girl that was extremely intoxicated. Long story short, he leaves her and she's stumbling around outside by herself. I stopped her and asked if she wanted me to call her an Uber, she kept refusing. I asked if she knew where she was, she said \"not really.\" I offered to even get in the Uber with her to make sure she made it home. She refused and refused, tried to go back into Sabrosa and the bouncer stopped her and told her she had to leave. (So clearly, he has taken a look at her and could absolutely identify her if she tried to go back in). This girl comes back out and says she wanted water...\nHere is where my issue begins with Sabrosa. The bouncer, a very tall, big man with long curly hair refuses to get water for us. We walk a little bit towards the back door of Sabrosa and try and get this girl in an Uber some more. She bolts back into Sabrosa and the bouncer lets her in. I asked him if she got in and why he would let her in knowing she could very easily be put in an awful situation, she has no idea where she is, no clue where her friends are at, didn't know the last time she had been with her friends that night. She could barely walk! Two of us were holding her up and the bouncer just let her go right back in. When I asked where she went his responses were \"who?\" To which I explained some more. He says \"oh, a drunk girl?\" And scoffs. I get it, you see tons of drunk girls each night but this was different and you knew exactly who I was talking about. After about 2 minutes of trying to get in to find her he says \"I'm a bouncer, not a babysitter.\" To which I told him off and he said \"hey, you're a Good Samaritan, good for you but that ain't my job.\" \nAS THE MANAGER (a women) SAT AT THE FRONT DOOR WATCHING THIS ALL HAPPEN.\nI just want to make a clear note that it actually is your job, working at a bar, to know when someone has had enough and needs to be cut off. The front door staff at Sabrosa are some of the worst that I've come across and it blows my mind that they were all witness to this belligerent girl, but continued to turn a blind eye rather than help.", "author": "Summer .."}

As I was waiting for my Lyft minding my own business a woman approached me and ASKED for help. She wanted help to get away from male who followed her out. I did my best and tried to walk her back to Sabrosa. That's when the male got aggressive with me and told me to mind my own business. I walked back to the club and asked for the bouncers for help. This is when one of he bouncers came up to me and pretty much gave me the \"dont worry about it the male is a regular member\" and shes drunk and to mind my own business speech. I was appalled and also baffled when he also expressed he was some \"Doctor\". Basically telling me it's OK for this male take advantage of this female. The bouncer was a white male wearing a hip hop shirt about 6\"1 with facial hair. I told the bouncer she was clearly asking for HELP. To my surprise he pretty much brushed me away to mind my business. Another bouncer had to intervene to calm down. I explained to the bouncer I have morals and for this to happen is not right. I can't walk away from this situation and pretend like nothing is happening. God forbid this girl end up murdered and on news the next morning. If I see something wrong I speak up. This is how I was raised and hope this can be read by someone in management at this bar to know a certain employee don't care for the safety of their customers.", "author": "Justine M."}

The music sounded good (at least whatever I could hear from outside the bar during my 25 minute wait in line). Finally got in, and I danced as my friends waited another several minutes for drinks, which were literally not worth it with the amount of people bumping into you causing you to spill your drink anyway. The crowd ranges from \"entitled frat boy screaming 'Don't Stop Believin'' at the top of his lungs\" to \"creepy man grabbing you without your consent\" which of course, I don't blame the bar for, but if you're coming here you should probably keep it in mind. \n\nStill, all of this doesn't warrant a one star review, which brings me to my least favorite part of the night. A friend of mine had a little too much to drink, so I took him outside to get some air. The bouncer yelled at us to move out of in front of the bar and go sit on the side, and not wanting to cause trouble, we complied. Went and sat on a chair on the side, and immediately, a bar employee told approached us and screamed \"Get the fuck off my chairs.\" I was baffled since the bouncer told us to sit here literally a minute ago. He said \"No he didn't say that you need to fucking go,\" and not wanting to escalate the situation, I apologized and walked away from the area. He pointed at us threateningly until we reached across the street--it was literally the most extra and unnecessary thing I had experienced. My friends reported similar experiences with the bouncers/employees there, one of whom even threatened to put my friend in a headlock if he didn't leave. Like, I get that dealing with drunk people isn't fun (and I was DD so I was stone-cold sober), but when we're causing no harm to anyone else, it seems like a logical idea to treat your paying customers with at least a little respect. Needless to say, we won't be coming back. \n\nOh also, make sure you have cash on you, because there is a $5 cover for this trash experience.", "author": "Mahima N."}

The good news is they employ him right at the front door so you'll never miss him. I used to go to this place all the time (even though their cover charge is ridiculous) but after last night I'll never go back. I arrived with a group of friends and the bouncer was yelling at two girls in front of us to get their money out. They decided they didn't like his tone so they left. We were up next and he started telling me \"what are you doing get your money out\". I showed him my money and proceeded to the counter to pay. He started yelling at my friends (who I was paying for), \"get your money out, how many times do you I have to say it get your money out now\". I told him I didn't like the tone he was using since he wanted to give off the vibe that we were inmates and he was our CO. He put his face right up to mine and said \"what did you say?\" So I once again told him to tone it down and relax but he decided that I \"didn't deserve to get in\" and opened the line for me to leave. Not much of a threat since Jackson is a wonderful bar across the street with great music and no cover. However this isn't the first time I've seen him treat females at the bar inappropriately. The fact that he got in my face as if he was going to take some violent action towards me is unbelievable. I hope some action will be taken towards his contempt for women, social exclusion, discrimination, hostility, belittling, and violent mannerisms but I bet he'll still be employed next weekend so I'm just happy that people will be able to see my post and will choose not to go to sabrosa anymore.", "author": "Alyxandra R."}

He then proceeded to grab the girl violently and attempted to shove her forward (wouldn't be surprised if she had a bruised wrist) to which she demanded he stop grabbing her and he continued. He was clearly harassing her and using his large frame to dominate rather than his intelligence, since the girl pointed out that he couldn't take a strangers legal ID away. It is in fact ILLEGAL for a bouncer to confiscate an ID (only police can) and this was as they were leaving the bar. The girl turned and asked to speak to the manager, but the aggressive bouncer continued to push the girl and the guy asking for his ID back, saying \"No, get out.\" This was clearly out of line and proof that this business hires aggressive, unintelligent, sexist, and unlawful employees.

Not only because I'm a huge Mexican food lover (so much that I started a Mexican Dinner Club, M.D.C.) but also since after my first visit I saw what a great Bar Sabrosa has. The bar alone takes up about 1/3 of the restaurant and has a great vibe and scene for drinks or light bites.  There's something about a great over sized bar in a restaurant that I like that excites me. Probably since I know I'll frequent the restaurant that much more often to have a drink or two at the bar. Sure enough, a week after visiting  Sabrosa for dinner I was back for a Friday Happy Hour with a friend. The Happy Hour was great, special drink and food deals with a great scene at reasonable happy hour prices! 3200 Fillmore St, San Francisco, CA 94123. (415) 638-6500.\n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista. Emily", "author": "JetSettingFashionista J."}

I'll cut them some slack because they are relatively new but some aspects of the experience were just unacceptable.\n\nThe food was ok.  We started with the guacamole and as far as those go, it was good but not great.  Nice touch with the pomegranates but didn't make it exceptional.  The quesadilla de tinge poblano was ok as well, nothing epic.  So far just average, right? Well what took it well below par was my entree: the spice-rubbed, blackened rib-eye. It was definitely rubbed and blackened but unfortunately they forgot to cook it. At all.  The ribeye is a marbled cut and it's flavor comes from cooking the fat itself, perfect at medium-rare but terrible rare.  Rare is what I got, white fat with bloody red meat, I had to send it back.  Inspecting the steak, the waitress felt terrible and they tried to make up for it but the steak came back over-cooked.  Without us asking, they comp'd the entree which was nice of them but didn't take away from the overall disappointment of the meal.\n\nService was fine, they were busy and left us stranded a couple of times but overall ok.  Decor was decent, pretty familiar array of banquet-style communal tables with booths and traditional tables against a modern, low-lit backdrop.  It was incredibly loud, think night club-level but that was fine.\n\nHope they get their shit together in the coming months, place has potential but was definitely a #fail for us.", "author": "Saminda W."}

THE SERVICE. \n\nOur server did the absolute minimum and was very inattentive the entire time. We ordered our food + chips and guac (another mystery solved: why are chips and guac priced at $9? Because they give you 9 chips) And waited for a very. Long. Time. Finally we asked if we could get our chips us at least. She brought them and our food came shortly after. Huevos rancheros were decent but nothing to shout about. Also the guacamole was bland so we added salt and Tapatio. \n\nIt was the opening game for the NBA playoffs and Sabrosa has advertised this on their chalkboard outside so we thought it would be a great place to watch. The game was playing on the tvs but no sound. We asked our server if we could have sound for the game and she gave us a strange look (you advertised this place as a watch spot so???) and said \"oof, I will ask, but I don't think he will say yes\" (referring to the grumpy bartender) she asked him right in front of us and he replied no (??????) (As you may be beginning to realize his was a very confusing experience for me) so we went without sound until a few min before tip off when I guess the bartender had a change of heart. \n\nGood thing he did because the game drew a crowd which was nice.

They probably should have mentioned at that moment that they often turn the music up so loud that even adults need to cover their ears and is not a suitable place for children. I was looking for a lunch restaurant and this was clearly a bar that happens to serve food. Guess it is partially my fault for not researching this place heavily in advance \n\nAlso they accidentally gave appetizers to our table we told them it wasn't ours and even after a few of us accidentally took chips they picked it up and gave it to another table. Pretty sure that's a health code violation but I'm not sure. It was weird nonetheless", "author": "Shawn P."}

Grilled fish is not my choice when it comes to tacos, but hey this ain't the hardcore place where I can get cabeza or buche right?  But the grilled fish was moist, mango/fruit salsa gave the sweetness to produce some umami when a good amount of lime was squeezed on.  The pork was well marinated and had great flavors as well.\n\n$42 for a small pitcher of Don Julio margarita may be a bit pricey but \"yo you're in the Marina dude, it's all good, just pop those collars\".  We had two as it was super freshly made, it definitely didn't taste like those syrupy store bought kind.  It was very clean, basic lemon with a hint of sweetness only.  Awesome!\n\nThe guacamole could of used more lime, salt and pepper but smooth and creamy anyway.\n\nEnchiladas with mashed potatos...had an non-spicy green sauce of something I forgot, tomatillo?  But I just have one word in my head when sharing one of the three enchiladas, CARBS and yummy carbs.\n\nCeviche de Aquachile, real deal ceviche where all the seafood is raw and they use lime to marinate and cook.  Therefore, shrimp you can see is half raw.  Heavy amounts of lime juice which is good and seasoned very well.\n\nRoasted corn with ricotta?...on the side was refreshing.\n\nTrio of salsa, two were very spicy, I like.\n\nHomemade chips everywhere from our dishes.\n\nGreat service from Anna.", "author": "Kevin L."}

I ordered the enchiladas with the verde sauce which was actually pretty good. My mom got the veggie quesadillas which she she enjoyed as well. Everyone else was not a fan of their meal. They did, however, make very strong margaritas which was a plus. \n\nThe waitress was awful. It was like she didn't want to give us the time of day since we weren't typical Marina dudes.

It became a little busier as we were there, but they hadn't printed nearly enough menus for even their small amount of patrons. I saw the staff apologizing to people seated near us but what's especially weird is that the staff was hanging out doing nothing when we arrived, with plenty of time to prepare menus. \n\nThe Weird/Bad:\nIt was a cold rainy day here in SF and they opened up the doors on one side of the restaurant to accommodate a larger party with a dog. Why not just have this party sit outside? By having them sit half inside/half outside with the open doors, it made the entire restaurant cold and unpleasant.\n\nThe Plain Bad:\nI ordered the avocado benedict and it was the least flavorful benedict I have had in SF. My boyfriend agreed it was completely bland - \"like eating milk.\" There wasn't even any lemon flavor to the hollandaise sauce. The eggs were poached well but the dish was bordering on cold which was REALLY weird given that our order was the only one at the time since they were initially so empty.

This place has an upbeat vibe with loud music, pretty girls, and good drinks. I like that they had comfortable outdoor seating. I got the happy hour special: shot, draft beer, and taco for $10. It's a great deal since beers are normally $6 and tacos are 3 for $14. Other things on the happy hour menu are $5 apps and cheap margaritas by the glass/pitcher. The shot was the house tequila, good beer choices lagunitas, Stella, etc. and we got to choose a taco from the dinner menu. Tried the carne asada and fish, both were flavorful with good sauces, tortilla could be better.

Maybe it's because I'm spoiled by delicious Mexican food and my inexplicable obsession with T-lish, but I have high standards for my tacos and guac and Sabrosa really fell short on the delivery. The carnitas tacos were dry, lacked any semblance of flavor and simply disappointed. The Queso taco, although seemingly unique and filled with a cheddar layer on the surface, fell flat as well. The meat was dry and the tortilla texture was off.\n\nGiven the amazing service, I really didn't want to dislike Sabrosa yet and was hoping the margaritas could make up for it. And while they weren't awful, they definitely weren't anything to write home about. My attempt at being a novice mixologist at home far surpassed the quality of these margaritas. \n\nSo yes, the ambiance is great - cool interior design and very open vibe.

I went inside to see if there was a hostess or someone to seat us but there wasn't so we just sat at the table outside. There was a check there from a pervious party that was sitting on the table. We sat at the table for 30 minutes until I decided to go find the manager and tell her no one had even acknowledged us! She gave me a pretty sorry apology if you ask me and took our drink orders since that was all we were there to do. The server then came out after her and apologized saying she thought we were the party that was there before, excuse me do we look like the people who were seated here before... doubtful. Anyways, we proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for the beer and two drinks we ordered. Ten minutes to mix a few drinks after they had already ignored us for so long, not okay. We then proceeded to get up and leave because it was so ridiculous and made us so mad!\n\nI have never left a restaurant before nor am I a huge complainer, I understand things happen. However, their lack of service and urgency to fix anything about their poor service was a huge turn off. Will not be coming here again, nor will I be recommending to anyone.

We tried the seafood & tomato stew, it was only ok, the rice was very much at the forefront which wasn't really what we would have been hoping for.

Excellent ambiance for that purpose, as well as a central location in the marina. \n\nLet's get straight into the food recommendations. We were lucky enough to get some tastings from the kitchen and I recommend the following:\n1. Guacamole - yes, it's a boring thing to order, but it was very good. They added pomegranate seeds to it which added a tangy, delightful flavor\n2. Ceviche - great seasoning and good seafood. A strong saffron taste (it felt like it, at least), which was excellent\n\nNow on to the minuses (or, as we like to say in strategy consulting, \"areas of opportunity\")\n1. Menu - it needs more diversity. I don't eat pork or beef and found the options to be substantially limited. This is San Francisco, after all, and a menu without ample pescetarian / vegetarian options isn't an SF menu at all \n\n2. Noise - the sound really carries in this place, and it's definitely not meant for couples on a date (I couldn't hear from across the table and my throat hurt from yelling after we left) \n\n3. Service. Let me preface this by saying everyone was extraordinarily nice. But I think they have yet to hammer out how service can be effective. Long wait times in b/w ordering drinks and entrees. ...And we had a very strange experience. I ordered the Diablo (I exclusively drink spicy tequila drinks), which the waiter forgot to mention had been made \"too spicy\" due to over-soaking of jalapenos....instead of a new drink, received a literally watered-down version of my old drink\n\nOverall, it's a fun atmosphere and I would recommend this as a group pregame spot before a night out in the marina.

I couldn't believe it.\n\n   Next he suggested the tlacoyo and with his home run on the drink I took the advice and got it and wow, that made my night!

The kicker:  service was SO bad that I only tipped 10%.  Rather than having a manager walk over and ask me if my service was bad ( which most places do when the tip is low) the waiter put the check BACK ON THE TABLE and circled us for 15 minutes to see if we changed the tip!!

The ambiance  of the  restaurant  is nice, a bit loud with the few people that were there, it's deafening with larger crowds, however. That said, we love the decor and design. \n\nWhere Sabrosa really misses the mark is with its food. It is simply not good. Almost every item we had was bland and lacked seasoning. Asked for a recommendation from our server , we got the brussel sprouts. BLAND BLAND BLAND. The dish had some shaved fried pepper dust on top which added some heat ,but the onions and sprouts were devoid of any seasoning and dunked in some liquefied,  orange colored animal fat that tasted like unsalted grease. It oozed oil on the palate.   Salt, pepper, lime... something with seasoning , please!\n\nNext we had the ceveche augachile, it was the best thing we had, fresh tasting fish in  citrus  and good chips. Of what we tried, it was the only item I would try again. \n\nNext we tried a chicken and  also the  al pastor quesadilla. Again, totally unseasoned and in the same thick orange fat. The al pastor was dry and incredibly greasy at the same time. Both lacked seasoning , but the chicken quesadilla was the far better of the two. Both dipping sauces were uninspired. \n\nI had the luca pinot , fruity and un-aged with no discernible tanin.  I didn't finish it , but the Malkin malbec was excellent. \n\nI could see that the kitchen was having trouble serving 20 patrons and getting out the food, on a busy night I can see why others are complaining about wait times. \n\nWe will give it a second chance, but the owners need to really taste the food and improve what they are turning out.

The bartender must have thought we were drunk and quickly took the $5 and said thanks. I had no idea what he was doing and then realized it later. It was late and there were many drunk people in the bar. That is stealing and lame. 20somethings watch out. I am sure the bartenders have to deal with alot of craziness.

We were drawn in by the lure of a 3-7pm happy hour, but took my chances with the dinner menu so that we could enjoy the patio seating. I wanted to love this place because the decor was fresh and such an improvement from the dark City Tavern venue. Unfortunately, the only reason I give this place two stars is 1 for the EXCELLENT service (very attentive) and 2 for the decor and open architecture. If you are looking for a good meal, there are plenty of better options in the area.\n\nOn the search for a yummy salad my sister and I ordered the chicken cesar and the beet salad and added an order of the chips and guac since that is a sure sign of a good Mexican restaurant! The chips and guac came out first and were fine--homemade chips and light salt (although I though $9 was very pricey). However, when our salads arrived we were both shocked by how salty they were. It sounds crazy, but I swear they SALTED the lettuce before service. At first I thought it was just the cojita cheese on the cesar, but the beet salad was dangerously salty too! Needless to say, we picked at our greens and left starved--and extremely over salted! \n\nI realize I've reviewed a Mexican restaurant only on the basis of their salads and guac, but we left so unsatisfied and honestly in a salt shock, that I'd never go back for the food. Maybe, just maybe I'll give it another shot to try the margaritas.", "author": "J A."}

Carnitas also very flavorful and large chunks of perfectly cooked pork.  The enchiladas are served in their own little cast iron pan and topped with some sort of cabbage slaw, also excellent.

The crabmeat tostado tasted like the chips with overpowered citrus juice.  To be honest I could not taste the crabmeat.  We had the ceviche as well and it looked like a bowl of soup and tasted like hot sauce.  And now for the finale...the steak tacos...it looked like the crap that falls to the bottom of your oven that you will need a snow scrapper and a bottle of cleaner to remove it.  I was in shock that the kitchen allowed the plate to arrive at our table in that condition.

The fruits have it an interesting contrast of textures. I liked that. The margaritas were generous and strong. \n\nAt first I thought the ceviche was a bit short on fish, and the waitress told me she would remove it from the bill, and kindly asked me if I wanted anything else. I said I didn't, not because I didn't  want (the food was great) but because I was already full. \n\nShe eventually removed it from the bill and even though I insisted them to put it because I really enjoyed the ceviche and wanted to pay for it, the manager came very nicely apologized for what they considered a mistake and told me he wouldn't charge me. \n\nThis is professional, this is caring.

We were outside and as soon as the restaurant closed, little Hugo comes over to our table and aggressively starts snatching (yes snatching) our drinks out of our hands and saying 'you're done with that, you're done with that)  I understand that bars close and you need to have people's drinks finished, but there are classy and professional ways of handling these types of situations. For example (Hugo please take notes) 'Hey guys, we're closing and we're going to need you to finish your drinks, do you mind if I grab them?' This on top of the horrible food makes for a bad choice of restaurants to visit. The only reason this place gets even one star is because I feel bad for the people I know who work there.

It is classy and fun inside and is a great spot to enjoy a night out !\n\nTo start, the drinks are so yummy and all very creative. My favorites were the Dos Besos, the Night Creature and the Pepino Diablo. Really, you can't go wrong with any of the cocktails here. \n\nFor food, The guacamole is to die for and it's A MUST! Also the salsa trio is super yummy as well and perfect to share with others as appetizers. \n\nFor entrees, the Chuletn De Res Al Chilmole (ribeye) is beyond amazing. The spices on it are so good and it was cooked to perfection.

I would not go in without ordering a bowl, highly recommend.\n\nI would also recommend the Chuleton De Res Al Chilmole. I'm pretty sure its the same cut of meat that they use at Brixton for their rib eye but the Chili Dry rub that they use at Sabrosa is amazing.  The thing literally cuts like butter and melts in your mouth! You wont find a better stake for under $30 anywhere in the city, I guarantee it!\n\nIf you want something smaller the the Questaco is delicious and not to filling.  If you you that and and the chips and quac it would be a perfect little meal.  \n\nAs far as the service, its been great every time.  I have eaten at the bar alone and at a table with a big group and every time the food and drinks came out fast.  The bar tenders and waiters were super friendly and checked on us just enough to let us enjoy our meals and company but not let us go unattended. \n\nOverall, Sabrosa gets two thumbs up from me.

Guacamole is a must- they add pomegranate seeds and thin slices of jalapeno, served with organic, homemade  thinly sliced corn tortilla chips. The ceviche was perfectly tangy and extra fresh.  Not sure what they're called, but get the tacos made with grilled cheese, steak and a dollop of guacamole- excellent.

Chips were a stale pita bread. Salsas were bland/something you would find off the shelf in low-end grocery store.\n4) The tacos had a foul cheese on top which resembled cheese wiz and made me feel nauseous eating them. From the looks of it, the plate appeared microwaved or at best reheated.\n5) The rib eye steak was ordered medium rare. It came out at least well-done and burnt on the outside.

It was very straightforward with clean, whole ingredients, (read: lacking flavor). The pumpkin seeds were a nice, unique touch. Like the chips, the portion was small. Like all of their portions. They use quality ingredients in everything though, which is especially attractive in regards to their margaritas. Delish! Although I could probably stop at Whole Foods and make the same thing at home for cheaper. But cocktails always taste better when you pay $11 for them, right?!\nDefinitely stay away when they're busy. They can't seem to manage multiple tables at once.

My hubby and I don't often get motivated to go out for Sunday brunch, so when we do, it's a \"special occasion,\" and we really go all out. We had been to Sabrosa in November a couple of weeks after they had opened for dinner and thought it was OK. The service was fine, the drinks were good, the chips and salsa weren't our favorite but they did the trick. The food, I don't even remember what I ordered...I think it was a quesadilla? My husband ordered a veggie entree of some sort and said it lacked flavor, but figured he had made a poor decision to begin with, ordering a boring vegetarian dish. Anyway, we were out with our pup so needed somewhere with outdoor seating. Mexican food is one of our favorite cuisines so we decided to give Saborsa another shot. Such a bad decision...while we were waiting to sit down, one of the servers sneezed the loudest sneeze I've ever heard, into his sleeve before entering back into the restaurant. We both said, \"gross,\" but were glad it just wasn't near any food. We were sat quickly - the one positive event during our experience. It was between 10-15 minutes before the server acknowledged us. Since we had so much time to look at the menu, we quickly ordered the salsa trio and guacamole to start with. For entrees, the grilled chicken, cojito, lemon and pistachio \"cesar salad,\" and the pumpkin seed sauce enchiladas with mashed potato, queso casero, hard boiled eggs & salsa chiltomate. The salad was very presentable, the taste on the other hand was so bitter. The lemon was so overwhelming that I couldn't taste anything else. How can you mess us delicious crisp romaine, pistachios, cheese, and grilled chicken?! It was like the salad was tossed in one pound of lemon rind and some oil. Good thing the grilled chicken wasn't tossed in the salad. I at least filled up on the grilled chicken - my dog did too! So disappointing. The \"pumpkin\" enchiladas...very interesting. They were saturated in a green flavorless sauce. They were indeed filled with mashed potatoes but we aren't sure what happened to the cheese or pumpkin. They were completely flavorless. We have come to conclusion that they have officially mastered mixing what should be awesome ingredients together into flavorless ensembles. So bizarre. Do not waste your Sunday brunch at Sabrosa. It was literally depressing walking home and passing by at least half a dozen other restaurants and seeing the scrumptious foods on the patron's plates. Our experience completely changed the tone and mood of the day. Such a shame. We had high hopes for a great sit down full service Mexican restaurant opening up in the area, but Sabrosa just cannot pull it off. Sadly we will not be returning. P.S. the reason I gave this place two stars and not one, is because it was not as bad as the worst restaurant in SF, CHOUQUETS!", "author": "Kelsey K."}

I've been on several occasions and the service has always been excellent. I drink a ton of water and the little tequila bottles they bring you for water are on point. Big fan of h2o. That sh*t is nice. Best item is the tlocoyo. Its a brunch item though.", "author": "Michael P."}

The guacamole and chips and 3 different hot sauces were really, really tasty.  It has a nice ambiance at happy hour.  The service was excellent - great bartenders who are very attentive.  I saw the early diners get their entrees and it all looked very good.  We'll definitely come back to have dinner here.", "author": "Jenny B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-08-22", "description": "The service and food definitely leave something to be desired.  The food is pricey, not awesome, and served in small portions.  Even when slow the service isn't great.  It seems like it would be a cool bar scene, but I won't be back.  I live in the neighborhood and have visited for brunch and dinner.  Probably a good spot just for drinks.", "author": "Chris C."}

For brunch I had the Brussel sprouts with poached egg yolk and leeks.  So good, I finished the whole thing,(I was by myself) and the Chilaquiles rojo were some of the best I've had. I loved that there were beans in them.\nWhen I had dinner at Sabrosa I ate with friends and shared a lot of different dishes.  My two favorite were the Brussel sprout quesadilla and the Caldo. I could eat that soup everyday.  So beautiful and delicious. \nSo Sabrosa does a happy hour now and it's so awesome.  This is now my favorite time to go in. The bar isn't too crowded and the calamari tac's are such a good deal. These tacos kind of blew my mind.  Fried calamari and a tomato, caper and green olive salsa. So good!!! \nAnd lastly I've had such sweet servers and bartenders.  Barney (our server) was such sweetheart and Jon ( bartender) was hilarious and made me some delicious drinks.  I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Sammy S."}

The staff are very friendly, and attentive. Great non-alcoholic beverages! The atmosphere is very nice and airy feeling. The downside are the portions...very small for the money they charge. I would recommend this restaurant for a first date or a quick drink with friends.", "author": "Kimberly L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-02-23", "description": "We've now been to sabrosa twice and both times we've been, we've been disappointed with the quality of the cocktails we've ordered. While one of the main complaints is the pricing for a very average margarita, admittedly you're paying for the decor and location when one ventures into the triangle - sabrosa, eastside west, and balboa. I still think there are far better options for a drinks in the area - I'd say tacolicious is the better option between the two. So if you're into the whole triangle scene, I get it and you can justify going to sabrosa, for everyone else not so much...", "author": "Andrew B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-16", "description": "It is very rare for me to post reviews.  In the case of Sabrosa, I'm only doing so because I don't think the restaurant will make it unless it dramatically upgrades its service.  I've been twice.  Both times, everyone at the table agreed that the food was excellent.  The guacamole is fantastic, the brunch menu is creative and delicious and the lunch/dinner menu is also great.  The problem is the service.  The first time we went, multiple orders came back wrong (a chorizo scramble with no chorizo???!!!  Seriously?)  The second time, it wasn't until I was actually eating that I was told that they were out of beans - so I wouldn't be getting any with my order.  How can a Mexican restaurant be out of beans??!!  Lastly, the wait staff is extremely lack luster and SLOW.  They aren't trained on the menu (they can't answer any questions about the dishes or drinks), and presenting the basics like, water, salt, pepper and hot sauce seems to really put them out.  If this isn't frustrating enough, during both visits our waitress/waiter disappeared for long stretches.  This is really hard to do in such a small restaurant.  All in all, I'll wrap it up by saying that Sabrosa's fresh and delicious food is superb.  But the service is so poor, I find the dining experience to be frustrating and disappointing.  I hope management will see this post as helpful criticism.  I really do want Sabrosa to succeed.", "author": "Cookie B."}
