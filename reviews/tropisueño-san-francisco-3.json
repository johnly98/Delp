One of my girlfriends recommended the restaurant to us for our first experience in San Francisco and I can definitely see why she did. The service was seriously outstanding, specifically mentioning on of the male bartenders who was ridiculously accommodating and warm to us, totally hooked us up at a table at their high top bar when the place was jamming and we likely would have had to wait an hour to get seated if he hadn't made room for us. With that being said, the seating at the high top bar was a little weird. It was maybe a four feet wide table and we were sitting directly across the table from strangers. It was as if we were at a community table with other people except that the community table was seriously small and intimate and there was no way you weren't part of the conversation the people next to you and across from you were having. I wouldn't choose to sit at this table near the bar if you want any sort of privacy. For us, it was okay because we were literally having one drink, some chips and salsa and heading out to the next place.\n\nQuick qualm, literally no outlets in this place. Searched high and low and then high and low again for an outlet to plug my phone into and they did not have one anywhere. I asked the host station, fail. I asked the bar, fail. Nothing. That was a bummer as we were getting place to place in San Francisco with the help of Uber and our maps and without cell phones we were SOL so we had to go to another place to get our phones charged up. The place was hopping on a Monday night. It was downtown but set apart from the business of the road in a little square with other restaurants nearby, I really enjoyed the area. They had margaritas, tequilas, you know, what you'd expect at a Mexican restaurant. When we sat down at the high top table, there was left over salsa from the people before us in front of us and so for a while we weren't given a fresh bowl there was no way in heck I was dipping my chips into somebodies used salsa so eventually I grabbed the attention of someone and he replaced our salsas. They brought out three different kinds and they were so delicious! Some hot, some smoky but they were all really tasty and unlike any salsas I had had before. I got a vodka soda and it was strong as heck.\n\nI'd definitely come back here another time but I'd try and sit at the regular bar or grab a table.", "author": "Samantha S."}

This place was recommended to me by one of the locals an eh it was average. I came here on a Tuesday night and even then (surprisingly)it was quite busy. This place is known for their cocktails so definitely come here for that, their drink menu is quite large. They offer indoor, outdoor and bar seating at this restaurant. The staff was very friendly and the manager came to our table to check on us.\n\nI ended up getting a shrimp dish. The ingredients sounded great on the menu however my meal was bland. The type of bland that makes you want to sprinkle a bit of salt on your food and I'm not a salt person. The waitress also didn't tell me my meal came with tortillas to wrap it all in but the manager came in after I was finished to tell me I didn't get them. Well bummer, I wonder if that would have made the dish a little different but still.. not impressed. My favorite part of the meal was the triple dip that was brought out and the guacamole. I think I ate more of that during my meal than my actual meal.\n\nI'd be willing to give this place a second chance if ever came back this way but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice.", "author": "Maria U."}

We were seated immediately upon arrival on a Sunday, and it was quite crowded.  When we were seated, we got the usual delicious chips and salsa that they provide complimentary.  \n\nThe food quality and preparation is where this experience derailed and led to this poor review.  Our table ordered 2 of the pollo asado.  We waited a while for the kitchen to cook our meal and when it finally came, we cut into our chicken eager to eat it, but found out it was raw on the inside.  We notified the server, who took it back to the kitchen.  Someone else came to our table to let us know the entire order was being re-fired (which generally means they are cooking an entirely new order for us).  However, a long wait again later, we received the same chickens that we sent back - they just put it back on the grill for longer.  We could tell they were the same because of the areas where we cut into it the first time.  As a result of this laziness and frugality shown by the restaurant, our meals were overcooked, burnt, and the chicken's natural moisture was obliterated during the recooking process.  When you cut into meat and recook it, it gets dry.  The meal was dry and had many charred/burnt areas on the outside.  Veggies and garnish on the dish were also not redone, as they got cold while they recooked the chicken.  There was also no discount offered or any other resolution offered.\n\nTLDR - Expensive, overpriced food.  If they make a mistake (even if it's as bad as undercooking chicken, which can get you really sick), they will not do their best to fully correct the mistake.  They will take the cheapest option possible to finish your table's ticket and charge you for their mistake.  This is really disappointing because their lunch menu and burritos are actually pretty good, but I don't think I'll be back.", "author": "Tim L."}

The waitresses take your drink and food order and you don't wait long for your entrees to come. \n\nI ordered the pollo con mole poblano. The chicken was tender and flavorful.

The prices are good and so is the food!\n\nMy husband and I stopped by on a Monday night around 5 and luckily, we were able to find a couple of spots on their communal high top table. The place was hoppin' already by that time, so get there early if you want to get a seat. We ordered a couple glasses of their House Margarita, Guacamole, Flautas, and Nachos. Everything was great. Their chips are so nice and light. We must have gone through three baskets of chips! The salsas were very tasty too and they had some heat to them too. The Nachos which is only available during HH had a nice amount of meat and other toppings. Definitely a must order with your drink. I enjoyed the Flautas so much, we had to order another plate after we inhaled the first one.\n\nWe've also been here for dinner, but we almost froze eating outside in their patio the last time we were there on a Friday night. There was a 30 to 45 minute wait in their main dining room and as we couldn't wait that long to eat, we opted to sit outside. Unfortunately they don't have heaters outside. They do give you a blanket, but it wasn't enough to keep me warm. The moral of this story is to put your name on the waiting list via Yelp ahead of time, so you don't have to wait too long for a table inside. \n\nWe will definitely be back!

During lunch hours, you go order at the register, they give you a number, you seat yourself and then they bring your food to the table when it's ready. A bit like nando's approach. They brought us a basket of chips with our food and there was a salsa bar. \n\nI have to say I liked the idea of the salsa bar but it was in a small area where only one person could fit at once so a line quickly built up of folks waiting for salsa. \n\nI ordered a plate with a cheese enchilada and a barbacoa flauta. It had rice and beans on the side. Overall, the food was good. The rice had a bit too much cumin for my taste and was a bit dry. Black beans were fine but could've had more flavor.

After an 8hr shift of retail hell - a group of us would come here often and drown ourselves in endless margaritas and the whole delish happy hour menu which was legit and such a deal!! Regardless of the nostalgic memories, I came here recently again for HH with the beau and the food and drinks were still on point, happy to say!!\n\nThe place is large with indoor/outdoor seating, and a sweet intimate bar area. Super easy and convenient location....right snacked in downtown. Service is consistent, nice, and quick, reservations easily made online. Tip: Def. don't expect this place to be super authentic given location overall - not a hole in the wall, very much a full on restaurant, casual & modern.\n\nA MUST ORDER - house margarita!! Super refreshing, light, tasty, and easy to knock back. Def. Will get stronger and stronger as you go ;)\n\nFood talk -\n\n(1) house chips & salsa - fresh hot super crispy chips, lightly salted and easy to eat. All 3 sauces had a very different taste, all good - but def. liked the green verde sauce the most!\n\n(2) ceviche - super tangy and refreshing, I know it's a little too sour for others....but I actually prefer my ceviche tangy so it was all good for me.\n\n(3) chicken taco - was tasty and juicy, not dry at all. Flavor was def. on the lighter side + add any of those colorful sauces AND boom. Flavahh.\n\n(4) steak taco - this was AOK, a little more chewy than I'd prefer but still tasty. There were some fatty pieces that had good flavor, but most pieces were cooked very....well done. (Which is def. Not preferred for steak)\n\n(5) fried fish taco - yes there is a lot of sauce and toppings all over, but still didn't take away from this perfectly puffed fried hunk a fish - bombbb!!!! Refreshing from the toppings and yet still hefty since fried sooo freakn beautifully rightttt **salivation in progress\n\n(6) flautas - fried super crispy, then jam packed with salsa and a bunch of condiments. The chicken and flavor inside is light (which seems to be a thing with their chicken)...BUT again - add one of the House sauces = AOK and good for the price.\n\n(7) cheese quesadilla - average and good for sharing, pretty standard and enjoyable...but def. not anything amazing.", "author": "Saleen L."}

I would come back over and over again for these flautas! The total bill for a beer, sangria, 4 tacos, and flautas was $34 and we were stuffed. Good value!", "author": "Christine S."}

They give out free chips and three types of salsas that are mildly spicy but so good! They have the thinner chips so it's super easy to down two bowls of them! We shared the guacamole, which was a super tiny portion and came in a small stone bowl. It was good but pretty expensive for the amount of guac. We also got the carnitas tostada that are a bit messy too eat but really good to start with. For main, we also shared the grilled steak with rice, beans and a cheese enchilada. It's definitely very flavorful though the meat was a little tough. The good thing though this was a huge sized portion and ended up being more than enough for the two of us.", "author": "Jen L."}

Service was just okay, taking a significantly long time to take our payment and process. I got the Tropisueno carne asada... they did not provide a steak knife, only a regular butter knife. It was incredibly difficult to cut because it was on the medium rare end and I nearly knocked my water glass off the tiny table twice just trying to cut through the meat. \n\nBoth my food and my girlfriend's food were very tasty. They get three stars for quality of food. The tiny table made it difficult to do just about anything, including dipping your chips in salsa - constantly risking knocking over your drinks because there was no space for your elbows anywhere.\n\nMy girlfriend is from Michoac\u00e1n... and the food, while tasty, did not strike her as authentically Mexican - more white-washed.\n\nThis is probably a cool place to come for lunch, but dinner was miserable. We couldn't talk with each other without yelling... the drunk girls at the table next to us (clearly Kardashian fans - they looked and acted as annoying as that family does) were way too loud and used the word \"like\" every nanosecond. Clearly, millennial brains are incapable of processing complex thoughts and sentences. We spent all night making fun of our table-neighbors.\n\nI will not be returning. There are authentic Mexican taquerias in SF that have real Mexican food and authenticity. \n\nBusser staff was phenomenally helpful - much better than our waiter service.

I couldn't decide where to go. So I searched for restaurants in San Francisco and sorted by reviews. Tropisue\u00f1o is pretty high up there. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion with me wanting to sit outside. New York City is in a heatwave right now so it feels nice to sit outside even if it's a bit chilly. \n\nServer was really nice. Even a bit flirtatious at times but I would much prefer that over someone cold. He recommended a few things but I opted for the pick 3 option. \n\nNow at some point they thought I had already ate so they didn't bring chips and salsa. He apologized for the mistake and brought it out right away. It was worth the wait. I could have filled up just on the chips and 3 salsa options. \n\nI ordered the chile con queso. I was pretty shocked when it came because it was a dish that looked like a small clump of cheese surrounded by verde sauce. Boy, was I wrong! This was probably one of the top dips I've had in my life. 100% order the chile con queso! \n\nAs for the 3 options I had a barbacoa flauta, cheese tamale and barbacoa enchilada. The flauta and the tamale were fine but there was something I did not like about the enchilada. Almost tasted like what I imagine cardboard tastes like.

They had never tried Mexican food, so I wanted to impress them by taking them to my one and only favorite Mexican restaurant in the city. Well, WAS- no longer is anymore for the following reasons:\n\nWe ordered from their happy hour menu- a couple of beers and grilled chicken and steak tacos. Mind you, this is their FIRST (and mostly likely LAST) time eating Mexican food. When we all got our food, my mother-in-law began to gag and pulled a long black strand of hair out from her mouth after taking her first bite into her taco. Not only was that absolutely disgusting, but she could have choked on it! That was enough to put the rest of us off in complete and utter disgust and not eat the rest our tacos either. I alerted our server in which he called the manager over to approach our table. When he did, he had a very cold, insensitive and dismissive demeanor and only said that he'd take her taco off the bill. One (1) TACO. That's a joke! $3 mind you, and offered no apology or some sort of compensation for the rest of us not eating our food either. When the bill came, it was just that- $3 had been taken off and nothing more. PATHETIC!!! It is just petty, pathetic, cheap and dismissive all together! We wasted $40 on food we all did NOT even eat. The manager literally made the executive decision to deduct $3 off the bill for the most vile and unsanitary thing a restaurant could do. That's the most unprofessional/ amateur/dismissive thing a \"manager\" from a very popular SF restaurant could ever do. It was a nasty, long black strand of hair entangled in the meat, onions and lettuce inside the taco!!! To their careless and dismissive manager- could you imagine taking a bite out of that and gagging so much you want to throw up? WHY don't your cooks wear hairnets on their heads to prevent this from ever happening??? You should be on top of that! You need a thorough food safety and sanitation evaluation stat! \n\nI'm so embarrassed and livid with their reaction and lack of action to do something after learning the fact that one of their cooks' hair fell into our food. I used to (no longer will) eat and drink at Tropi Sueno a lot as I work right next door to it. I had been going for 6 years or more and always attended their Cinco De Mayo parties. I had recommended and taken hundreds of clients, and friends and family there too. I always spoke so highly of their great food, and even though their service was always terrible and rude, I still went for the food. Now, how could we ever go back after that disgusting hair incident?!\n\nTheir lack of professionalism and action to do the right thing is appalling. So, I have decided I will definitely NEVER EVER step foot in Tropisueno ever again! I work at a company that receives thousands of clients a year, so I will make sure to spread the word not to go and eat their hairy tacos either. :/", "author": "Bridie T."}

This place is located in the middle of a busy area and we happened to stubble upon it after seeing a movie.  It was pretty crowded but luckily we were able to find 2 open seats at the communal table in the bar so we got to skip the wait.  This worked out well and we were happy to have gotten pretty quick service.  The second time we came we were seated in the dining area and we were seated right away.  The service was a bit slow as we sat with our empty dinner plates in front of us for over 10 minutes before anyone came by but they seemed to be pretty busy.\n\nFood:\nChips and salsa (comes with 3 different types all of which are tasty).  The bowl of chips is huge especially for just two people so after indulging a bit too much of the chips we decided to split our entr\u00e9e. \n\nLos Favoritos pick 3 plate with a chicken taco, cheese enchilada, and chicken flauta.  Everything was pretty good, not the best I have ever had, but good enough.  \n\nTaste of 3 ceviches (de camarones, de pescado, salmon crudo).  The portion was pretty small for $17.50 but that worked out well because we didn't eat it all.  The shrimp one was our favorite but the salmon tartare was not what we were expecting and I didn't think it worked well with the chips.  It would have been better in a poke bowl.\n\nCamarones al Mojo de ajo was our favorite dish of both times we dined here. The butter and garlic sauce was delish and I would definitely get it again.  There were 6 decent sized shrimp in the order and it was only $12.\n\nFor dessert they only offer flan and tres leches, we went with the tres leches and it was delicious.  Super moist and topped with whipped cream and strawberries.  We devoured the whole thing even though we were stuffed from dinner.\n\nAll in all, if we are ever in the neighborhood we would go back to this restaurant and have the chips and salsa, the shrimp and the dessert.", "author": "Danielle B."}

As my esteemed colleague would say, \"I'd kill for a burrito right now\" and know that's over at Tropisueno. \n\nThe line isn't too bad if you go before 12pm when the lunch hour crowd shows up. Usually if you show up outside of this time period you'll be waiting no more than a few minutes for your food. I had the carne asada burrito with sour cream and guacamole. This one is pretty good and on par with most taquerias. I can't finish the whole thing, it's way too much food. Remember they are in the financial district so the prices are a bit higher than a cash only restaurant in the mission. Otherwise there is pretty decent service here during lunch. There is no waiter to take your order during lunch. Only counter service which is fine since they can't keep up with the people coming in during the lunch hour rush. When it comes to the salsa station they have it all. Jalapenos, pico de gallo, chili verde, you name it they have it. Definitely get the really spicy one to go with your free chips if you dine in. Otherwise it's a few extra bucks to take chips to go with salsa.", "author": "Tim G."}

Before we could even place our order our server brought over a bowl of tortilla chips and three dips (salsa, salsa verde, and a warm red sauce). All three were delicious, but I definitely leaned towards the salsa verde.\n\nAfter placing our order we were surprised by how fast our food arrived. Today, I ordered the pick 2 combo with a carnitas taco, a pork tamales, and rice and beans. Everything was delicious and well seasoned (and not too salty)!

The short review of this place would be that in my opinion Tropisue\u00f1o is the only Mexican restaurant that is worth visiting in downtown or FiDi.\n\nI've been here about a dozen times mostly for the lunch service. My advice is to come early like around 11:30 am as by 12 there is a line out of the door. 12:30 pm and you are better off getting something to-go as you will be end up standing and holding your plate for a seat to open up. The menu here is a little more than what you would expect in a Taqueria. It covers nachos, tacos, burritos, tostadas, tortas, enchiladas, tamale, quesadillas and plates with meat or combination of other items along with rice and beans. Ordering system for lunch is hybrid table service style, where you order at the counter, pay, get a token, find a table and have the food delivered to the table.\n\nOver a period of time I've tried most of the items on the menu and have yet to come across something that I have not liked. All ingredients used are fresh and the meat is especially good. You have a wide range of options for the meat which includes carne asada, barbacoa, chorizo, chile verde, al pastor, pollo asado and pollo tinga among others. There is a salsa bar on the inside to the right that you can help yourself too.\n\nMy favorite is the wet burrito i.e. Burrito Mojado ($9.50) that can be topped with red or green sauce. Making any burrito a super ($1.75) would add sour cream and guacamole to the burrito, but I generally avoid that as it makes it very heavy for lunch.\n\nPrice wise Tropisue\u00f1o is about 20% more expensive that other Taqueria's or quick serve Mexican restaurants in FiDi but the extra cost is totally worth it. When benchmarked against other Mexican restaurants Tropisue\u00f1o stands head and shoulders above the rest, hence it gets a well-deserved 5 star rating.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I travel across the world for business......AS A FOOD CRITIC. This will be the first of many reviews I splash across social media, urging people to not spend their money at an establishment that promotes mediocre food, lack of ambiance but most importantly, a staff that is so rude....so stuck on themselves that you are made to feel uncomfortable while dining. \n\nMy food was doused in a tomato puree tasting sauce that was weak in flavor and lacked any sort of authenticity or creativity. The portions were so small they made \"small plates\" look like an entree.\n\nMy assistant came to dinner with the group and was served a margarita without being asked for ID.....my assistant is 20. We, of course, had her order to see if they would card and they did not. We took 2 sips of the bland, lifeless, poor excuse for a margarita and then tried to flag our server down to send it back for an alternative beverage. \n\nThe server advised us is in a snotty tone that since we took a few sips, they would not take the drink back for an alternative option. I asked to speak to a manage. A sloppy looking guy approached the table. He was visibly upset that we had taken him away from flirting with a pair of women at the table next to us......overhearing him say he would buy them a few rounds if they were interested in coming back to his house after they closed was the preface I had to my \"guest experience\" with this individual. \n\nDrunk, immature and sloven...this is the management representation of Tropisueno. Kudos to the owners for employing a pathetic excuse of a human being named Alex. At first I thought it was a joke, possibly a drunken guest pretending to be a manager. But alas, this is in fact, the General Manager. While I was explaining my frustrations of the poor service, horrendous food and beverages, all he as concerned about was making googly eyes and looking down my blouse. \n\nSince you are unable to rationalize with an irrational person, my party of 5 got up and left. Alex stumbled after us and tried to \"salvage the guest experience\" by offering to send us all new food and take care of the entire check. My guess is he was too intoxicated to remember this encounter but my staff and I were not. We were so appalled by the lack of professionalism that the poor food, beverages and service took a backseat to being sexually harassed at the table by an individual that gets paid to manage this establishment.

I was pleasantly surprised! The food was really good. The salsas they brought out at the beginning were so good and flavorful - my favorite was the orange habanero sauce. We ordered the platanos fritos and chile con queso for apps and they were sooooo good. The queso has a little dab of goat cheese in the middle that was a great combo with the typical queso cheese. \n\nFor my meal, I got a chicken tinga flauta and barbacoa enchilada. Both were great. Their margs were a little too sweet for my taste, but the food was great and super convenient to where I was staying. Will def be back next time I'm in SF for work.", "author": "Morgan S."}

My friends and I stumbled upon this place at noon on a Sunday, and it was definitely a catch. There was no wait at all and plenty of open tables. Would definitely come back! \n\nThe food was reasonably priced for SF: $3.50 for a regular taco, $4.25 for \"premium\" tacos. I like the concept of ordering first and picking an open seat of choice. My tacos were DELICIOUS--especially the tortillas. However, my friends and I shared the guacamole ($6) and was underwhelmed. The portion was so small for $6 and it lacked flavor, which was the biggest miss for me. \n\nOverall, a great place to try if you're in the area!", "author": "Erika S."}

Actually that's a disservice to Chipotle to compare them to this place.  It's more like an ineffective Chevy's.  Yeah, that's more appropriate.\n\nBasically you wait in line for 10-15 minutes and they take your order and then you take a number sign and wait another 10-15 minutes for the food to come to your table. And then the food is made incorrectly and the stuff that is made correctly still sucks and tastes like it could have made at a grocery store.  That mediocre.\n\nAlso, to add insult to injury, if you want a margarita, you have to wait in a different line at the bar and order there separately. And the drinks taste like they came out of a Slurpee machine.  Ok, that's a disservice to Slurpee machines. \n\nReally, just go to Chipotle and save a ton of money and time and get your margaritas from basically anywhere else.", "author": "Saminda W."}

I have been loving this place for close to 10 years now and it just keeps getting better and better. Here are a few reasons why you should love Tropisue\u00f1o as much as I do: \n\n1. Delicious Mexican food! Fish or shrimp tacos are my favorites. They also make amazing, fresh salads. \n2. So fast/efficient service. Even when the line looks like Disneyland's Splash Mountain circa 1989 - you can still be back at your desk 45 minutes later. \n3. Drinks on drinks. The margaritas are the perfect combination of tart, sweet and salty. I recommend always having two - instant mood changer. But only if you're not going back to work - don't be that guy/girl!\n\nTake a co-worker, friend, date - anyone you want to have a good time with.

The Margherita with jalapeno, rimmed with a spicy sweet salt was just the right amount of tequila.  I ordered the Pollo Asado with rice and pinto beans.  The chicken was quite dry and the flavor leaves something to be desired.  The pinto beans and rice were filling only.  There are also veggies included such as zucchini and they are alright too.

However, based on the price, we picked HH so that we can share more dishes together.\n\nChips and three types of salsa as an appetizer and all three were mmm mmm delicious! Orange salsa has a kick to it so if you can't handle spiciness, definitely be cautious at first. We ordered the fish tacos, nachos, chicken quesadilla suiza, and flautas, ranked from best to least favorite. Pro tip: split the taco tortilla into two so that you can get two tacos instead (shout out to my friend that realized that after she took a bite.) Would definitely get the tacos and nachos again. There is nothing too special about the quesadilla (they all taste the same to me), and do yourself a favor and don't order the flauta. That was a waste of calories IMO.

Fresh chips and 3 variety of salsa was served quickly after seating. One page menu has a good variety of choices and portion size are pretty decent.\n\nCons: This place is so overhyped. Definitely make reservations on Yelp, it saves you so much time and it's so easy. Super dim lighting that strained my eyes looking at the menu. I got the carne asada plate and asked for medium but it came out brunt and really dry. \n\nOrdered: Tampiqueno ($18)\n\nWould I recommend: My coworker RAVED about this place so maybe my expectations were set too high but I'm glad I checked this place off my list so I can say \"been there, done that\" and not return.

A no frills quick ordering system, we placed an order for veggie quesadillas, veggie burritos and veggie tortas with a portion of guacamole and horchata for drinks\n\nWe started off with delicious warm corn chips which were extremely thin and crispy and definitely freshly done. The food was served very quickly and the server was extremely warm. The portions are huge and we actually struggled to finish the three dishes we ordered for three people. The salsa bar is quite extensive and delicious, topped up with radish, pickles, onions and chillies which just add amazingly to the flavour of the food. The food in itself was also delicious and all three dishes were very well made.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-04-09", "description": "Ever since seeing them featured on an old episode of Check Please Bay Area!, I'd been wanting to check out Tropisueno.  I always knew they were a popular spot, especially for the nearby lunch crowd, but I had never really looked into them before.  On the show, not only did it seem like they had a pretty fun vibe (margaritas!), but the food looked great as well!\n\nHaving been here for both lunch and dinner, I can say that the restaurant really does seem to have a lively vibe at all times of day (on weekends, at least).  During both trips, the restaurant was pretty full, but especially so for dinner, so reservations are definitely recommended.  It's not hard to understand why they're so popular though; beyond the vibe, Tropisueno's menu is unlike anything you'd find nearby...not to mention their burrito counter!\n\n-- THREE ITEM COMBINATION PLATE with a Chicken Flauta, Chicken Tamale, and a Carnitas Taco...$14.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tropisue%C3%B1o-san-francisco-3?select=4jUg9aRTYid_gk4_c8lZEg)\nI regret doubling up on chicken (that's rookie move, Mike!), but this was otherwise solid...and hefty!  The flauta was the best of the bunch (crispy, not super oily, and very flavorful), but the others were great as well.  The carnitas were well seasoned and the tamale was surprisingly moist.  What's more, love how their combo plate included avocados!\n\n-- HUARACHES \"TRES COCHINITAS\" - Three Thick Tortilla \"Sandals\" with Three Kinds of Pork - Chile Verde, Carnitas, and Al Pastor with Pineapple...$14\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/tropisue%C3%B1o-san-francisco-3?select=-ylxn2-TQDENmhAO7PMcLw)\nWhile this dish was just as filling, I didn't find it nearly as satisfying.  The sandals started out great, but they got a little soggy and mealy by the end.  As for the three types of pork, the chile verde one was just okay, but I liked the carnitas - crisp and delicious.  Sadly though, while they're great individually, the pineapples and al pastor didn't mesh for me (really sweet).\n\nEven though the food left me feeling a little conflicted, Tropisueno is a pretty good spot if you're looking for something different near this part of downtown/Union Square.  At the very least, it's a good value for the money (their free chips and salsa are awesome!).  Given the choice though, if I was in the area, I'd be more inclined to try something new and head to El Toreador for something similar to Tropisueno, but in a far more convenient location.\n\nExcept for their burritos - I'd be willing to come back to try that.

We found two seats across from each other at the community table, uncomfortably squished between two parties. We had just ordered when I noticed two seats opened up at the end of the bar, so naturally, we opted to move for more space. I walked over to the bar and was confronted by the bartender who basically called me out for moving: \"Is that table not good enough for you? Did those people do something to you?\" He was loudly proclaiming that I had now screwed with their system and it's not going to be his fault when we don't get our food because our waitress won't know where we are. (We moved 5 feet from the community table and literally could see everyone orders being brought out from the kitchen). My boyfriend talked to our original waitress/server and let her know we were going to be sitting at the bar. Our new server/bartender (Alejandro) then went on to ask us if we had ever worked in a restaurant because we clearly don't understand how the system works and how we're jipping our original server of his tip. My boyfriend offered to close out and tip so it would just go to the original server but the Alejandro said he didn't want that and finally settled on transferring our bill over, muttering things to other staff as he did so. \n\nI was honestly so shocked and frustrated at how huge of an asshole he was being for absolutely no reason, I started to tear up. I then got even more mad at myself for tearing up over something so stupid, so of course that made me cry more. He finally then came over very apologetically and tried to give us free drinks (but I refused to drink it out of principle lol). At the end of the night, my boyfriend asked if the whole issue was about tip because we would have gladly tipped them both if the situation was handled properly. But wait for it, PLOT TWIST: WE STILL ENDED UP TIPPING BOTH OF THEM. We tipped the standard 15% or whatever to Alejandro and then gave the original server $20 in cash, because we're nice fucking people and didn't deserve the shitty service we received. \n\nTLDR: food is good, drinks are strong, alejandro is a dick", "author": "Estelle C."}

Do not get me wrong, Tropisue\u00f1o dishes out some tasty dishes, but I feel like the hype is not really what one would expect. I think I have gotten used to the fact that the North Bay slings out some pretty tasty Mexican food, so it is hard for me to really give a stellar review as so few really stand out from each other. Tropisue\u00f1o as mentioned before does a wonderful job, but do not expect a mind blowing experience as many have put it. \n\nSo onto to more of a positive note! Do not be intimidated by parking as there are garages nearby or if you are lucky, some street parking. Due to the close proximity to the Moscone Center and most of all downtown SF, expect ample parking around (On a good day!). Once you finally make it to the restaurant, you may encounter a long line, but fear not as it moves much quicker than you would expect. With the long line it gives you ample time to look over the semi lengthy menu. Once you order via the Chipotle style method, make your way to one of the many ample seats in the house and do not forget to order a delicious beverage from their wonderful bartenders (Margaritas on point!). My go to for the few times I have visited was the Tropisue\u00f1o Torta, basically a vegetarian/vegan nightmare as it is loaded with all of their meat choices, but it is pretty darn good! Pricing will surprise you as well considering their downtown location, so do not expect to pay to much a premium price here, plus I hear their happy hour is one of the best in town (Cannot comment though). \n\nSo overall, Tropisue\u00f1o checks all the boxes you are looking for, but for me it does not stick out from various other Mexican food establishments sadly. A solid choice though if you are craving Mexican food in downtown SF.", "author": "Ryan A."}

I've been coming to Tropisueno for years, and each time it's been for happy hour. Tropisueno is nestled in the cute Yerba Buena Lane complex, right by bunch of restaurants and St. Patrick's Church, and is Bart-accessible (Powell Bart).  As for food, I can only speak (but fondly!) on behalf of happy hour.  Tropisueno's happy hour is between 4-6pm on Mondays through Fridays.  Happy hour is only in the bar area and outside.  Happy hour can get really packed too, as this place is frequented by those who work around the area.  \n\nSome of my favorite happy hour menu items include the street tacos (chicken, beef), flautas, quesadilla suiza, and the ceviche. All great items, very tasty, and affordable (the cheap HH price point is definitely a welcomed rarity in the downtown area).  Fresh chips and salsa come with your meal too; you are given three types of salsa, which are all really delicious...my favorite being the orange sauce/salsa.  I'm always dipping my chips with this orange sauce and smothering my tacos with it too.  As for drinks?  Get the house margarita.  The house margarita is pretty strong, so two of them can get you pretty tipsy.  The good food, good prices, and good drinks definitely will make you pretty happy at happy hour!\n\nDefinitely will continue coming back here again and again.

It's  not just that this is the best Mexican food in SoMa, which generally lacks anything decent, it's just of the best in the city. I think what makes Trop so good and unique is that it combines the offerings of a simple taqueria during the day, and elevated Mexican food with a romantic, sultry setting at night and no matter what you choose the food is killer. \n\nSo lunch time - it's busy, but they're like Henry Ford's Model A assembly line in there. I'm mainly a burrito or torta (mexican sandwich) guy here, and you can't go wrong with really any of the meats. The fish tacos here are solid, but they really excel with carnitas, carne asada, pollo asado, chili verde, etc. Tacos are good too, but I just love the burritos and tortas (the breaded pork one is so good). The agua fresca's and horchata is homemade and rotates every day and then after you grab your food hit the salsa bar. The lighter green tomatillo salsa and the bright orange ones are my favorite and have a solid kick.\n\nFor dinner, grab whatever floats your boat. I've only been 3-4 times over the years for dinner, but can't remember a bad meal. And on top of that, dinner is your time to go ham on their incredible margaritas. There's ample seating, lots of outdoor seating as well, and the restaurant stays pretty darn clean for how much traffic flies in and out every day. It's in the alley way across from the Metreon and in between St. Patrick's Church and the Marriott hotel. Do yourself a favor if you don't want to trek to the Mission and stop here for a damn good meal. Final shout out for an always polite and hustling staff.", "author": "Nate E."}

If it's anywhere near as packed as it is at lunch though, that might be tough. The line here is usually 20 or so deep from noon-1 pm, stretching well out of the restaurant. If you're in a rush, this isn't a great choice; depending on what you order, it may take 10-15 minutes to come out, longer if you have an obscure to-go order. All the better if you can get here around 11:30 am. \n\nThat said, the food is pretty solid, and the folks working here run a tight ship. They have a taco bar run by a bunch of ladies in the front, a full kitchen in the back, and a tequila bar that serves up house margaritas for those of us looking to take the edge off before noon. Order at the counter, grab your number, pay, then get the hell out of the way until someone finds you. \n\nThe best item I've had so far is the Chicken & Vegetable Sopa (despite my weekday-hungover self expecting chicken sopes, it's still a great lunch). Tostadas are alright; not really a repeat order. The burritos look decent, but they are definitely churning out food en masse for the lunch crowd; don't expect anything too fancy. Salsa bar is where it's at as far as adding extra flavor and spice, and the Tapatio hot sauce packets are a must-have. \n\nOne day when I'm in a lonely mood I'll come brave the throngs for dinner service.

Busy means people come for the delicious food right ? Well this place have basic tasting food. More like the typical Mexican fast food and not very authentic! If you're from San Francisco it doesn't compare to El Farolito or any Mexican restaurant in the mission! This place does have very cute decors (very festive). When you first walk in there's a big menu on the wall of everything they serve, you get in line to order and they bring the food to your table promptly after. The prices are reasonable but a little more than what a local taqueria would charge! Maybe because of the convenient location, in the heart of the city. My boyfriend ordered the chicken Fajita plate that looked better than it tasted! I ordered 3 tacos: Fish/Baja, Shrimp, and carne asada. I decided to make the carne asada taco \"super\" aka they add beans and guacamole for an extra dollar or two. My tacos were also alright, nothing special about them. Sadly I expected more. Maybe it's my fault for having such high expectations since it does have 4 stars on yelp and thousands of reviews raving about how delicious it is!

Honestly, I could just eat that all day. \n\nFood - Tacos are a must-try when visiting Tropisueno.

Their shrimp ceviche was a very taste side dish, but a little too sour for my taste. Would've been perfect if it had a little less lime in my opinion. \n\nSalsa Bar - so many good things to try! Pico de Gallo is great, their Tomatillo Green Salsa is also great! But what I was surprised with was their Orange Sauce, which I believe might've been habanero? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it sure did add a really great WA-POW to my tacos!\n\nDrinks - Tequila, tequila, tequila my friend. Tequila and I have always had a love-hate relationship, but Tropisueno's drinks just makes me love it so much more. The Herredura Cocktail was strong, but on a long day, sometimes it's exactly what you need.

For a rainy, Sunday night, the place was pretty poppin'. It was probably for this same reason that the service was just so-so. We didn't get our waters until after a while, and we kept getting wrong dishes delivered to us.\n\nTo start, we ordered some house guacamole and the ceviche. We had the combo ceviche - shrimp, salmon, and tilapia. I liked that there was mango with the shrimp. It gave it a nice sweetness, but the shrimp itself was a bit tough. The salmon and tilapia were pretty good. Just be careful with the tilapia because there are serrano peppers in there and it can get really spicy.\n\nFor my main, I ordered the two item combo. You get to choose from tacos, enchiladas, tamales, or flautas, and it comes with a side of rice and beans. I went with the carne asada taco and the chicken flauta. It was just alright. The beef seemed a tad overcooked, and the flauta was smothered in some green sauce so I couldn't really taste what the chicken was like. Maybe these are not their specialties. \n\nNot sure if I would be back if I were to return to SF - only because the mains weren't that great and the service was kind of lacking.

It's nicely situated next to Yerba Buena gardens and Target, which I hung around while waiting for the rest of the party. We arrived at 5:30pm for happy hour, which is 4-6pm. The inside bar area was packed, so we opted for seating outside in the patio. It was a really windy and cold day, so that wasn't too much fun being outside. Nonetheless, we hoped some drinks would warm us up. I had the House Margarita ($7) and Modelo Especial ($4) for drinks. The margarita was served with lots of ice, so it was even colder drinking that on a cold evening. Since we were hopping over to another spot for food later, my friend and I decided to share an order of the Ceviche ($5). To say the least, this was a very disappointing dish for me as it was too acidic and very tiny to me. I ended up allowing my friend to finish the rest of the dish and would definitely never order that again.\n\nOn the other hand, the complimentary chips and salsa sold me.

Tropisue\u00f1o is definitely a restaurant. However, don't let that dissuade you as the drinks are definitely quality.\n\nIt's open seating inside at a communal table and bar, and open seating at the outside patio. We opted to sit ourselves outside. It took a little while for the waiter to come and give us menus, so beware that the outside area is not as fast service-wise (which makes sense, given it's outside).\n\nWhile I say I'm a drinks first person, the salsa and chips were a nice addition. With three different types of salsa, there was a nice variety for your tastebuds. In particular, I liked the orange sauce, which was creamy and had a nice (habanero?) kick. We finished all of our chips and even got a refill, so there's definitely value gained here.\n\nIn terms of drinks, I got the Tropisue\u00f1o margarita and a La Pi\u00f1a. The Tropisue\u00f1o was a little disappointing to be honest-- I don't like sweet margaritas, but this one was almost too sour. It also tasted like it had Mezcal, which was weird as the menu claimed it was tequila. However, the redeeming drink was the La Pi\u00f1a, which had Mezcal but still tasted delicious.\n\nOverall a good experience minus my first drink. Fair prices for the area.

BUT at the same time not really, it seemed like that type of food but more catered to tech employees. \n\nI am definitely adding a full star specifically for the salsa bar and chips. That salsa bar is as extensive as a lot of places in the mission and they are quite bomb.com. The orange and salsa Verde are the best I think. Also their chips come out thin and warm and are incredibly addicting.", "author": "Samraaj B."}

Easy to get a table around 6PM but it got busy real quick shortly afterwards. They have happy hour from 4-6PM Mon-Fri, but only at the bar and tables outside. We wanted to catch HH but there was no bar seating open and it was chilly outside, so we ended up getting a table inside and ordering from the normal menu.\n\nFood was good, though nothing to really rave about. They served complimentary chips with 3 salsas, my favorite being the spicy orange habanero. I ordered the Tacos de Cachete, as did one of my friends, and tried my other friend's Sopa de Pollo. Everything's definitely on the pricier side given you can get equally, if not better, Mexican food at any of the countless hole-in-the-wall's in SF for less, but it's not pricey by SF standards in general.\n\n* TACOS DE CACHETE ($9) - 4/5\n[braised beef cheeks, taco truck style w/ onion, cilantro, salsa tomatillo & radish]\nVery tender and flavorful!\n\n* SOPA DE POLLO ($14) - 4/5\n[rich chicken and vegetable soup, tomato, pico de gallo & spices]\nPretty large bowl of soup. Warm and filling - perfect for a chilly night out.\n\nVery casual, cozy ambiance overall that reminded me of a lot of the Chevy's my family used to go to when I was a kid, where I'd get coloring papers and crayons while we waited for food.

Stand in this long line out the door and order at the counter where you watch the workers build your burritos and plates right in front of your eyes. They hand you a number as you play musical chairs and try to snag the best possible table (or any available table) in the house.\nIf you want an alcoholic drink, you must purchase separately at the bar, where 1 bartender is trying to make multiple drinks at a time with a dozen people holding their credit cards out, trying to be the first one to grab his attention.\nMenu is expansive with lots of vegetarian/vegan options. I had the veggie burrito here, which was big and very filling. I loved the open salsa bar, with plenty of hot sauces and toppings available.\n\nDinner transforms the restaurant into a nicer full-service style restaurant. They take reservations online only, which I recommend because walking in seems to have a wait all the time.\nThe menu is entirely different as well, which is much more meat-centric. It was actually hard to find fully vegan options, having to modify the few vegetarian options to make it work.\nI had the vegetable enchiladas with rice and beans-No cheese, and with white beans. (Refried is NOT vegetarian-friendly). I thought it was really good and cleaned my whole plate! \n\nThere's a great cocktail menu-comprising mostly of tequila-based drinks.

The ambiance is nice - dim lit restaurant (not great for pictures) and beautiful decor - almost feels like you're in a touristy part of Mexico! Except the food don't taste authentic. The price of the food is average (~$15 an entree) but I don't think it's worth it for the quality, maybe the ambiance and location. They do have generous portions though. \n\nThere is outdoor seating as well as a bar. Their drinks are known to be strong and they have a good tequila selection (though I haven't ordered any yet..too old for shots now!). \n\nNow with my little intro over, lets get into the review, shall we?!\n(Scroll down to star for BAD review part)\n\nI've been here twice and I don't think I'm coming back again after my most recent visit. My first visit was nice, but it wasn't the place for a broke college student. I do remember ordering a cocktail and it was pretty darn strong. If your intentions are to get drunk, you've come to the right place. Just don't drink a drive! Muni, bart, and taxi's are nearby if needed. To get a taxi, maybe you should go to the Marriot next door, haha. I remember ordering the chile verde for my first visit. From what I remember, I didn't eat half the plate, but I do remember it being good.... but I didn't eat half of it cause I don't like beans lol. \n\nMost recent visit, I made sure not to order the same thing for my first visit (almost forgot I ordered it) because it sounded soo good .. but I remember not liking it that much, haha. I ordered the a 3 item combo from OLD SCHOOL FAVORITE PLATO'S ($14.95). Thought it was the best deal if you ain't made of money yet lol. (Slowly growing in my career...). You can choose tacos or enchiladas, tamales, and flautas. I ordered 3 al pastor tacos since tacos have become a new love in my life. Thought it was meh because of the tortilla and what seemed to be no sauce on my meat. Tasted pretty bland. I'll stick to my street tacos. I also ordered a Corona ($6) since the cocktails are like $10+. My total came out to be a little over $20 for 3 tacos and a corona. \n\n***Okay, now where did this all go wrong? \n\nThis dinner was supposed to be my friends birthday dinner. She made reservations for 12 people and we were separated into 2 different tables nearby each other, but not next to each other. What are reservations really for, if you guys are not ready to seat a big group? I understand it's busy because it's the weekend and dinner time but still...\n\nWhile waiting for our orders, a family next to us was finishing up. We noticed that the father had an issue with the bill and he stayed there for about another half hour, trying to figure it out. Turns out he was billed more than he should have. \n(Wait for it.. there's more)\n\nOur orders came 2-3 at a time for our table at 6. Of course we didn't feel right to eat our dish while the others didn't have theirs yet, so by the time it did come, it got cold. Table manners! \n\nThe other table (our friends) finished before us because they got seated first. When paying for the bill, each table put multiple credit cards (5-6?). We try our best to make it easy for servers by writing the last four digits of the card with the cost of the transaction. My friend watched the server swipe each one. Now here's where things get weird.. my friends credit card goes missing when the rest of the tables cards get returned!! How the heck did a credit card go MISSING while getting swiped?! My friend accuses the server of theft. After arguing for about 30 mins, they compensated their table with a round of tequila shots (probably some low quality kind). BUT HER CREDIT CARD IS STILL MISSING!! She was pretty pissed because she had to use it for Cancun in the next 3 days.. \n\nNow we have a new group sitting next to us. The server doesn't come to them for about 30 minutes (probably because of the whole missing credit card thing), so they get up and leave without making their order. They dodged a bullet. \n\nNow our bill comes. We are charged 2 extra dishes on our bill, so this confused the whole table when splitting the tab. We notified them. New receipt, we write the cost of each transaction with the last 4 digits of the cc in the back again. When the waiter came to pick it up, we verbally told him about the cost of each card on the back of the receipt. We get the bill back and we're all charged ~$41 evenly... We tell him of another mistake, and he refunds us and swipes our cc's again for the charge that was on the receipt for each card. This could've saved us 20 minutes. \n\nThe birthday dinner was a disaster with the whole mis-charges and missing credit card. Don't think I'm coming back again, because our server was sketch AF with all these unnecessary additional charges (for us and other table). \n\nOh, and if you would like to know, his name was Hugo according to my receipt.

Every person I have met recently knows what I would do if I could get my hands on that orange sauce recipe! House-made, creamy orange, and straight fire emoji, this sauce has earned a special spot in my heart. \n\nThe orange sauce here has single-handedly increased my spice tolerance!  I used to never eat spicy food, but now as I find my palette changing, I am constantly badgering other members of my office to go with me!\n\nWhat's more is that orange sauce would never go well with a sub-par chip. Here at Tropis, they know how to do chips (way better than Chipotle, too, if I might add), which is why this salsa / chip thing can't be healthy.  It probably isn't, but curbing myself from this goodness would be like separation from a loved one.\n\nFood wise, I'd have to say I'm a big fan of tacos. However, I will say that Tropis food is pretty good, but it isn't the best Mexican food I've had. I usually get tacos or a quesadilla, but more recently, I have only bought to-go orders for the chips and dip.  The to-go orders come with a bag of chips, so make sure you get your sauces ready after you order!  I personally get 2 full containers of orange sauce, 1 mild tomato salsa, and the green sauce!  All of them are so great, but of course, orange is my favorite.\n\nAmbiance-wise, this restaurant is nicely decorated and is a solid lunch place to catch-up with a friend or do HH with coworkers!  Location is very ideal, with it being just a few blocks from Bart.  Lunch is served as an order or go type-of-deal (with the option of eating in) and dinner is served like a restaurant.  I'm generally really impressed with this place, so please keep up the great work!\n\nAnd, lastly, note to Tropis management: would you please package that orange sauce!?!? I will be your #1 fan. :)", "author": "Jana L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-08", "description": "I'm a vegetarian so I ordered the enchiladas de nopales for dinner. The corn sauce on it was super good. However the vegetables were kind of just thrown in the tortillas so when I tried to eat it, the tortilla and vegetables would fall apart and not stay together, which isn't a huge deal but it would have otherwise been easier to eat. The corn sauce was the best part. The rest of the enchilada was fine. I got it with black beans, rice, and some cabbage, which were all fine. \n\nIf you are vegetarian, be sure not to get refried beans because it has lard in it. A lot of the other vegetarian reviews here say people found meat in their food so I was anxious about that but everything turned out okay in my order. \n\nI should also share that I am from Southern California so I have higher and different standards for Mexican food than a lot of people do in the Bay Area. I would say my order was something different that I don't find everywhere, specifically referring to the corn crema.\n\nIn conclusion, corn sauce was great. I would recommend trying it at least once, and I would potentially go back for more. Keep in mind this has 2 dollar signs on Yelp so it is definitely on the pricier side. My enchiladas came out to about $15.50 with tax, and then I tipped on top of that.", "author": "Karishma M."}

There were pretty long lines around dinner time on Sunday, so it took us about 30 minutes to get a table for 2. Reserve in advance if you don't want to wait.\n\nWhat I liked:\n* Unlimited chips and salsa - the salsas were really good especially the green one (guacamole?) and the spicy orange one (habanero?).\n* Ambiance of the restaurant (dimly lit, semi-fancy), good for a date\n* Fair prices overall for a more upscale Mexican restaurant.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n* The main meals arrived pretty slowly (we managed to finish two servings of chips and salsa as a party of 2 before the mains arrived).\n\nI ordered the 3 item combo and picked a combination of flauta, enchilada, and tamale and also comes with rice and beans. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish the main because I naively ate too much of the chips and salsa before the main arrived. The main was alright, but I've had better versions before at other restaurants.\n\nOverall a 3.5/5.", "author": "Michael M."}

We put our name in at 6:10 and instantaneously received a text  confirming our spot in line. They said it would be a 45 minute wait. We went to Bluestem for a drink and came back after an hour after we still had not heard. When we arrived, the manager explained we were never put on the list and we should have responded to the text message and explained we were now bumped to the end of the wait list. We had to show him the text we received that stated it was just a confirmation that we indeed had a spot in line, no action needed. He was the manager, he should have known how it worked, right? We demanded that we be moved to the front of the line. He made us wait 3 more people down the list. Fine. We waited that long and we were hungry so we waited patiently. \n\nWhen we're finally seated we order some much needed margs. They come 45 minutes later (no exaggeration). We asked at least 5 times when they were coming and if we could possibly get comped the round since they were taking so long. The extremely unprofessional/inexperienced server acted like this had never happened before and said no we can't do that. He actually had the audacity to crack a joke to say \"We'll take it off the bill, no just kidding.\" When they finally came, they tasted like pure margarita mix and very little tequila. \n\nFood comes out immediately after drinks and it was cold. I couldn't even eat it - it was that cold. I lost my appetite..\n\nWe explained to our server how unhappy we were with everything in general and all he did was comp us with the dum dum lolli pops they hand out with the check. First time I didn't give a tip. In my life. How could I? I definitely do not recommend this spot. It ruined our night.", "author": "Marie J."}

Last time I met up with my girlfriends we came here for dinner, but this time I came here for both happy hour & dinner with one of my girl friend. I had different experiences here before than i did recently on sunday. the place itself is cute, noise wise it can get loud - i felt like i was yelling instead of talking, but i didn't mind it. the food is actually good for a more americanize mexican resto although i feel like they skimp on the meat. \n\nPast: We ate dinner on a friday 6-8pm i believe and it was a busy night, we get it. we didn't make a reservation because it was a last minute thing. we walked in and the front guy said the wait was between 45 to an hour if we were okay with that, which we were. he told us to come back in 20 minutes, we came back and we asked if there were tables ready and he ignored one of my friend so my other friend had to go talk to him. i get it, it's busy but you just ignored one of your customer that was in front of you as if you didn't see her. rude. anyways we got seated and both our waitresses were really nice, she even gave us our own pitcher of water. LOL so we wouldn't have to keep asking for water. \n\nRecently: We came here on a sunday 4-7pm, yeah they're also busy but less busy than before. we had a choice to eat outside so why not, it's a beautiful day out after a break from the rain. our waiter notified us that we can only order drinks & tapas. we were fine with it since we were going to order drinks anyways then dinner starts at 5pm? i ordered their red sangrai and my friend orders their house margarita. oh, they also serve you a bowl of fresh homemade chips and three different dips, which were delish! we also got guacamole & ceviche, yum! yeah, we for sure did not get full so we decided why not just have dinner since it's already 5pm! we asked for the menu and my friend ordered another margarita and our waiter was like \"order from me, i'm one of the best\" we looked at each other so confused when he walked away. LOL anyways for our dinner platter we ordered their 2 combo plate i got their al pastor enchilada & pork tamales w/ black bean, my friend got flautas & enchilada w/ extra rice. each plate on their combo comes with refried or black bean and rice! the only downside is that we didn't have napkins and when we got our food we didn't even have utensils to eat it with. we thought he probably thought the table already has all that stuff but nope. We had to flag him down and asked for utensils, oh after asking for it, he forgot when we asked him about utensils. UMMM, okay?\n\nAnyways, customer service is good I understand this place get busy and may forget things but they're very attentive, i appreciate that. I'd recommend this place, but if you're coming for dinner after 5pm I suggest you reserving a table.", "author": "Deneb T."}

First off, I do have to say that the food was delicious. But as good as it was, the negative experience, in great part, due to the team of employees left us feeling like this would not be a great place to return. Plus, the food is a bit overpriced for the quality. I get it. It's San Francisco and overhead is very high for any retail business. But it's hard to justify paying over $20 for a Mexican food combination meal and then you still have to account for a tip on top of that.\n\nWhen we entered the restaurant, the host asked, \"How many in your party?\" We replied \"Four.\" He then said, literally, \"We have a table and you can have it for 90 minutes. (As in we would have to leave the restaurant within 90 minutes after sitting at the table).\" It didn't exactly make us feel welcome and almost decided to skip dining here. The only reason we stayed is that we were entertaining guests from out of town and the cuisine served here was the only thing within walking distance everyone could agree on.\n\nFood was very good. But when we asked a staff member for another serving of tortilla chips, they never returned with them, so we had to ask another employee to retrieve chips for us. When the server presented the bill, I left a $100 dollar bill and asked for change (so that I could tip her cash). She returned about 20 seconds later and says, \"You only left me $100 (because the total bill was close to $100 and she implied that I was leaving her a small tip). I explained to her once again, \"I need change of a $100 bill so that I can tip you cash.\" She leaves again and brings back the change and then stands hovering over me while I'm trying to calculate the tip. This is incredibly awkward. Do you really want your server, literally, standing over your shoulder as you sit to calculate the tip and feel like they are examining you at the same time? I had to politely request, \"Please give us a moment while I calculate this.\" She did give us some time, but it was very unsettling nonetheless. It was not a great finish to our dining experience.\n\nSo to recap, food was good, but overpriced. Staff was not terribly welcoming and made everyone at the table feel awkward. If the aforementioned shortcomings of the staff were improved upon, I might entertain returning. But I'm not expecting that to be rectified anytime soon.", "author": "Peter C."}

One of my friends ordered the Pollo Asado which was super juicy/tender. My friend & I both ordered the Tampiqueno which was grilled beef carne asada with a beef barbacoa enchilada, & guac. Grilled beef was very juicy and flavorful. Not a fan of the enchilada since the beef inside was super dry. \nWe also ordered an appetizer, the Tostaditas de Carnitas. Very flavorful but messy to eat since it each mini tostada was on a flat 'chip' and taking one bite into it would cause the whole thing to crumble. It was also difficult to split since there were only 2 \"tostaditas.\" Would have been nice to know how many were noted on the menu. After receiving the bill, we noticed we were charged $3 for 2 side orders of cheese when we specifically asked to have the cheese on the Tampiqueno dishes on the side.

I take back my negative feelings and need to learn that crowded places in San Francisco are probably crowded because they are good. \n\nI've heard the line for burritos at lunchtime is endless for takeout, so be warned! Best time to come would be if you dart out of work a little early and can claim a table for your friends! Definitely a perfect place to start your evening off on the right foot!", "author": "Molli W."}

I had the chicken with mole poblano with nice mole sauce; it was good that it also included classic sides of rice and beans to round out the meal.

I recommend making a reservation online through Yelp roughly when you think your party will be ready. I made a few reservations, came to the restaurant and our name was called, only to find out we couldn't be seated until the whole party was there. This is totally fair and makes sense for them because they are incredibly busy! It was fine though because they let us get drinks at the bar while we waited. There's a huge selection of tequilas and mezcal margaritas, but they also have a full bar so you can really order anything if you're not a fan of tequila. I ordered the chicken and veggie enchiladas. Overall, nothing to write home about, was decent and like your average enchilada. It was pretty filling though, so the portions were good.

I'm very picky about guacamole being from Southern California where avocados literally just grow on trees, but this was delicious! 10/10. \n\nFor drinks, we sampled two of the margaritas. Both were the best margaritas I've ever had, hands down. \n\nFor entrees, we split the Callos a la Plancha, or seared scallops on a plantain-chorizo hash. These were phenomenal. The sweetness of the plantain mixed with the robust flavor of the chorizo was the perfect accompaniment to the seared scallops. We also ordered the Chicken with Mole Poblano.

I walked in (6:55pm)and asked for a table for 9... They told me that they can only do 8, but I explained that #9 was a 1year old kid. They laughed and said ok no problem. I was told it would be an hour to 1-1/2 hr wait. We were fine with that because we were having drinks at PRESS CLUB. After an hour we got a call that the table was ready. We got in and were taken to the back table that can only seat 6 adults comfortably.  When we said this wasn't going to work, the host said \" I explained from the beginning this is all we have\"... BULLSHIT, He never said that at all when I walked in the first time. We asked if we could sit outside since they had heaters and we were denied that as well because it was close... funny, they had 3 other parties outside. 3 members of our party we're ok with sitting at another table... The same host rudely declined by saying no and shurgging his shoulders at them.  He did say they can stay and wait another 30-40mins to eat. Really!?! 6 of us  eat now and the other 3 have to wait?!!!? We decided to go elsewhere and as I was leaving I watched the host throw his hands around telling a server he told us and gave  the \" I don't care hands\"... \n\nFor 4 years this has been our go to place for friends that visit because the food is great. \n\nThis one experience has changed that. \n\nThere were 2 host... 1st guy was short and Latino.

A packed house, but was able to snag a seat at the community bar table. First, the complimentary chips and the delish trio of salsas. $7 for a monster plate of nachos. And the ceviche sampler (thank you, Ann S for the tip) made plenty a meal for the both of us. Service in the store was excellent!", "author": "David N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-31", "description": "I recall when Tropisueno's doors opened in this windy lane. Initially, I dismissed it as another trendy upscale Mexican restaurant with upscale prices. Eventually I noticed that Tropisueno consistently draws a crowd. So I gave in to curiosity and ended up having dinner here. The ambience is surprisingly impressive. The venue is well-kept and very clean, yet somewhat rustic with some raw wood accents. There are also a few alcoved booths with curtains for a bit of privacy. It is a rather large space with an expansive bar and an exposed kitchen. It didn't feel spacious at the time, because it was a full house. They offer outdoor seating, but Yerba Buena Lane catches a lot of cross-wind, so I imagine those seats are only occupied on warm days. \n\nWe were presented with menus and complimentary chips and salsas. The chips were served warm, not too oily, thin and crisp. They were accompanied with a trio of salsas, which included what I believe was a spicy chili salsa, salsa verde, and a habanero mayo-looking one. Surprisingly, the orange-colored habanero-mayo salsa was our favorite due to its creaminess. Usually, salsa verde is my favorite. There is also a salsa bar, but I completely overlooked it, because everything was juicy and flavorful.\nWe completely polished these off while waiting for our entrees. Entrees come with Mexican rice, tortillas, and beans. We chose black & refried beans.\n\n$16 Pollo Asado - grilled chicken on bone, zucchini, mushrooms, squash, peppers:\nThe plate includes an entire chicken leg. A very thin crust formed on the outside, covering some very juicy thigh meat. It sat on top of the zucchini, squash, and peppers, which were delicious, but just a touch soggy. Even the black beans and rice were tasty filler items.\n\n$17 Tampiqueno - Niman ranch beef, thin-cut grilled carne asada, w/ beef barbacoa enchilada, guacamole:\nThe carne asada was juicy and full of flavor from the meat juices and intense seasoning. It was topped with uncut grilled scallions. The enchilada was covered in tangy salsa and queso fresco. The Mexican rice and refried pinto beans were topped with a scoop of guacamole, and absorbed some of the beef juices as well. Everything was excellent. I just wish it had a little bit more guac.\n\nSince dining here and enjoying the food, I feel enticed to possibly return for lunch or happy hour. The menu is a little different and prices are more affordable. For lunch, the restaurant operates as a taqueria-style cafeteria. Margaritas, ceviche, and tostadas for happy hour sounds pretty good, too.", "author": "Joy W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-03-19", "description": "This is probably the best Mexican restaurant in the Financial District. By day, it is a taqueria, by night, it is a restaurant. So that's why this is a clever concept. Workers from all over downtown SF, tourists, and local visitors eat here to get their fix of Mexican cuisine. At first, I glanced at their pink take-out menu what they had to offer. Then decided, this is a good place to start. Then saw 2 guys waiting, but read the sign. 1. Order whatever food you want to a server on the counter. 2. Order your drinks as you pay your order. 3. Seat for yourselves. Little, did  I Know there was a salsa bar in the dining area. And you can order cocktails, beers ahead of time while you order and pay for your food. The ordering is confusing at first, but their service is fast like less than 5 minutes or more depending on what food items you order. \nThe food is simple Mexican food but very authentic and it is all homemade. The reason like their refried beans is cooked with lard. I recognized their chorizo has a lot of cumin but it is salty. It was delicious. I just had 1 carne asada street taco and 1 chorizo street taco served with cilantro, and onions. Both are $3 each. Then the server asked if you wanted chips. I just forgot where the salsas are. So I just ate Tapatio sauce with it. I am missing my salsa for my chips, and tacos. Then I ordered Hibiscus tea or what they call Jamaica agua fresca in Mexico. It was more on the sweet side. Next time, I will add some lime juice to neutralize the sweetness of the drink. This place gets warm, but the drink is great. The server suggested light ice in my agua fresca - yummy - great recommendation. Food for lunch is cheap like $3 to $17, just depends on what you order.\nWhoever gave very low ratings, didn't know what the deal is here or what Mexican cuisine is all about. In my book, the food here is great, authentic and all homemade. Little did I know, the salsa bar is bonkers because they have a lot of choices to suit your spiciness, and added flavor profiles to savor your dish. At lunchtime, it is affordable, fast and really excellent. At night, it is more authentic, showstopper, game changer, and the quality are impeccable. Free tortilla chips are made to order but it was too salty, but they were thin. Yummy! Food is 5/5.\nThe ambience is great too, almost like a countryside home with some Mexican trinkets here and there. It has comfortable and welcoming vibe here. 5/5.\nService and attentiveness of all the staff especially to Manuel, the bartender are really great. That is what makes the place so memorable.\n5/5.\nTropisueno is a great Mexican restaurant located at the bustling and busy streets of the Financial District and tucked within the neighboring museums in downtown SF. If you want quality Mexican food that is authentic, homemade  and all of the food items are made from scratch. All of the items are fairly priced - come here and get your fix of Mexican cuisine with a casual and welcoming vibe, high-quality food and customer service.", "author": "Jade M."}

So let's get the not so enjoyable out of the way. Long story short (mainly cause i should have wrote this a week ago and could go into details more) Me and my wife's food came out semi hot in some places and just cold in others which let me know it was microwaved. My wife had opted not to have her food re-fired because she was taking it home.When we me mentioned our issue to Liz she was quick to  do her best to rectify the situation. OK food comes back out not only was it hot it was a totally new plate of food Cool !!!  Drinks were good, service was great (Good Job Liz!!)

They had all the options that you would see at a Mexican restaurant but nothing particularly unique.\n- Additionally Mexican cuisine is usually pretty Vegetarian friendly.

He lives in Chicago and loves Mexican food (his wife does not). It was between going here and going to Don Pistos (I have never been to either).  This was closer to my office and near his meeting so we got there at about 4:50pm on a Wed. night.\n\nThe hostess took my cell number and said there were a lot of reservations and she wasn't sure if we would get seated at 5:30 when they open the dining room for dinner (but no problem at all as it turns out).\n\nWe squatted at the bar and had a couple margaritas (good but too much ice, the salt they used is a bit smoky and good). We were served some of their thin, delicious and WARM chips and a trio of salsas. The service was a little spotty at the bar - we had to ask a few times to get some water -and the bar quickly filled up.\n\nI got a text at 5:30 on the nose and we were seated.

Cyrstal suggested the green sauce for my enchilada (I had ordered it with Mole) I THOUGHT we agreed to go with her suggestions but a small taste of the mole on the side (that is not how it turned out  - I got the Mole and no taste of the green sauce).\n\nWhat was weird was that a lot of  the food around us was coming out very quickly and being served by workers with disposable bright purple gloves on - it was just weird, and not so appealing (our food was not served by purple gloved hands).\n\nFrankly the happy hour food coming out at the bar looked better, so that is what I will do next time.\n\nMy food was good but not hot.\n\nI didn't see the bill.

The resulting plato ($12.95 + tax, I think) was the perfect analogue of a dish that I order quite often at Picante Berkeley.  My view is that Picante's version is tastier, though not by a mile.  Meanwhile you can't find any first-rate art museums in West Berkeley.\n\nConclusion:  I don't regret our choice but wasn't especially bowled over.  Said differently, Tropisue\u00f1o is alright!

Wife ordered a quesadilla, I got a margarita and two tacos.  That's where the problems began...\n\nFirst. my margarita was the most watered down drink I ever had.  Cup was completely filled with ice, and I was able to finish my drink in about three seconds.  I was completely ripped off for the $6.50 I spent on that drink.  Most restaurants try to jip you on drinks, but this was the worst case I've ever seen.  Was basically a shot of margarita in a cup of ice.\n\nThen, they almost gave my wife's quesadilla to the wrong person.  There's only a few things on the menu (taco, burrito, quesadilla), and with 12 people bunched together at a small table, people are bound to order the same things.  It would be helpful if the staff would actually make sure they're giving the food to the right person.  They almost gave my margarita to the wrong person too (who also ordered one), but my wife and I sat down and ordered a good 10 minutes before they did, so we knew it was my drink.  The staff is in such a hurry to get work done, they just give food and drinks to whoever claims them first.  Would be nice if they were more thorough to avoid mix ups.\n\nFinally, I had to wait about 30 minutes for my two tacos.  We reminded the wait staff twice before they finally brought them out.  I ate while my wife, who had finished her meal 10 minutes prior, sat and watched me eat.  The wait staff kept telling us \"your food is on it's way\", but it was clear they just forgot to make the food.  I had a fish taco and street taco.  They were ok, but fish taco was very overcooked.  Way too crispy.\n\nI'd give them two stars, but they comped me on my two tacos since they came so late.  Was nice of them to do that, but slow service, making sure the wait staff doesn't give my food to someone else, and not getting insanely ripped off on drinks isn't a way to spend an evening.

I wish I could smile all the time, but my resting bitch face prevents it :-p\n\nAny who, I got the combo plate with a taco and enchilada, both carne asada, and  the taco was excellent! I loved that they put the green salsa on it because it had this delicious tangy flavor that I couldn't get enough of. By the time I got to the enchilada I was pretty full, so I can't really comment on it, but it looked good! Oh and the salsas that came with the chips were super good, my favorite being the verde. I also like the orange one, but it was a tad too spicy for me.

I'm not using hyperbole when I say you'd probably have a comparable overall experience at the now defunct but once nearby Chevy's.\n\nIf you need some really good Mexican food you are a short Uber ride away from the Mission so don't be lazy.

Yelp can certainly lead you astray once in a while but I didn't expect that anything with more than 1k reviews could be wrong. \n\nFirst off, if you do end up going try and make a reservation. We went on a Weds night and people were being told there was a 30 min wait; luckily we had a reservation so were seated immediately.\n\nThe chips and salsa were actually decent but what's the deal with the stingy guacamole? For $8 I was definitely expecting enough guac to fill a crowd of people but they literally used an ice cream scoop and we got a single scoop of guac to share for the $8. This wouldn't have been enough for me alone. By the way, avocados cost like $1.50 at Whole Foods. Jeez. At least it tasted alright.\n\nThe drinks to me were very weak (read: low in alcohol) but also super uninspired. Not sure how to explain that one but none of the drinks seemed \"interesting\". I even asked the waiter which he likes and you'd think I asked him to read a drivers manual given how uninterested he seemed in all of them. \n\nIf you end up going, just realize that it's a pretty average tex mex bar. The steak I got was fine but sadly lukewarm. The rice was too dry even for me to eat (I LOVE rice!). Overall it was very average and deserves more like 3-3.5 stars.

The chips that the guacamole comes with are so good. Sometimes tortilla chips are too dense and oily, but these were perfectly crispy yet not too thin that they couldn't hold up the guac. The ceviche was a little lackluster--it was mostly avocado, and the seafood was not that interesting. The margaritas were good -- strong enough to be worth it but still tasty. Overall, a good meal. Would recommend the guacamole and margs, would not recommend the ceviche.", "author": "Camille J."}

By this time, everyone else was done with their main course and they were just waiting on me. I had to get my enchiladas to go and cancel my drink order.

Our party of two didn't have to wait long (~20 mins) to get a table even though the hostesses said it would be about 30-40 mins. Lies! This was a Saturday night, and we were the only party waiting for a table around 8PM. Useful fact, there is a single restroom for the ladies' room, so time your pee breaks accordingly!\n\nOur server Adam was very polite, but not as prompt. He was a sweetie and very courteous though, so shoutout to you Adam! We had the Petito (CUCUMBER FTW) and Tropisueno (sour bitters) margs, and started with their seared scallop ceviche. It actually wasn't very ceviche-like, and more like an appetizer. See pics for details :) We also shared the nopales enchiladas (the only veggie option under the enchiladas section), which were delicioso! SO GOOD. We debated between sharing the salmon plate or nopales, but they're known for their enchiladas, so we went with the nopales plate.\n\nI think that because I'm not from the city, Tropisueno isn't really a \"diamond in the rough.\" I've had amazing Mexican food down in South Bay where the food prices are much cheaper and the margs are still delicious! BUT if you're in the SOMA/Union Square area and looking for a place for an intimate but still loud date, this is your jam. They have candles, tahitian-style flowy window covers and dark lighting around dinner time, so this is a great place aesthetic-wise.

(There's the Rotunda or MKT if you want a fancy -- and spendy -- lunch, but what about when you want to sit down with your family and would prefer not doing that at a food court slash human zoo?)\n\nTropisueno is one of my favorite lunch options. (I can't vouch for it for dinner, but it has my lunch vote.)  It is relatively relaxed and right near Yuerba Buena. They have solid Mexican food at lunch: tortas, burritos and combination plates. A plentiful salsa bar. This is not a hole in the wall but it is seat-yourself. Inside, they've created a harmonious atmosphere in their roomy dining room, complete with twinkle lights and carved wood furniture, despite the cafeteria style line-up. It's a relatively quick and easy lunch stop, providing a welcome respite from nearby crowds. \n\nThe food is surprisingly hearty and good. The best orders are tortas and combo plates. They pass the good chip test: complimentary and taste deliciously handmade. Mole is a somewhat weaker link: saucy sweet versus packing good warm heat, but maybe still good for those who like a sweeter option.Careful at the salsa bar because some of the items marked as \"mild\" are anything but, and you'll find plentiful help-yourself sliced radishes, cilantro and fresh pico de gallo left out for the taking.", "author": "Rachel H."}

Their service is good, always checking if you need more water or anything else.  This is a good place for a great lunch, especially on a sunny day you can sit outside and enjoy the fresh air.  \n\nDinner time turns into a full service restaurant.  There is a pork dish that comes served cooked in 3 different styles and plated separately. I forgot the name of it but that is my favorite.  Very tender, fresh and seasoned well.   Their ceviche was also very good, you taste the fish and the fish is not over powered by the seasoning.

I'd learned my lesson with upscale Mexican food at Nopalito i.e. the most $$$ and smallest portions I've ever encountered for Mexican food. Tropisueno was finally put on the calendar when I was summoned to pick a dinner place around Powell, and when I realized they have normal-people portions instead of tapas, which is a euphemism for the fastest way to unknowingly go broke. \n\nAnyways, enough of Nopalito bashing. Here is my take on Tropisueno:\n\n(+/-) Chips and salsa, complimentary: Not particularly outstanding, and the chips aren't warm. Quite possibly bought in bulk from a wholesaler. The salsa is alright and the orange one is interestingly spicy, but otherwise it's average.\n\n(+) Rice and beans, complimentary: Choice of pinto, black, and white Peruvian. White beans! What a nice change from the age-old question of pinto or black.\n\n(++) Chile Verde, $14 (tender pieces of pork simmered in tangy tomatillos, green peppers, chiles and herbs. house favorite): Pork is so tender, it's like pork belly minus the fat. The seasoning is intense and complex: piquant, earthy, aromatic.\n\n(++) Enchiladas de Nopales, $14 (grilled chicken or veggies, corn, cactus and chiles in a fresh corn cream sauce): Hearty and creative take on enchiladas (cactus!!)\n\n(+) Margarita, $10: Much better than your average margarita at a random bar.\n\n(+) Margarita with violet liquor, $10: Personally I couldn't really taste the violet liquor, and I found it funny that it looked exactly like the regular margarita, except in a old fashioned glass rather than a Collins.\n\nPortions are huge and could last two meals. (Secret: I got a box for leftovers, but it was so tasty that I ended up finishing it while waiting for a movie at the Metreon)\n\nThe ambiance is upscale and nice--a theme of polished wood and dim lighting with an elegant storefront. They pay attention to details, like the wispy curtains in the windows and pebble-lined candles.\n\nTakes reservations with the easy online Yelp system, so we got a table at 7pm on a Saturday with no wait.

Sure enough, our table was ready about 45 minutes later..\n\nThe ambiance here is super romantic with dimmed lightings and adorable strings of lights and decors all over. However, the noise level did get a bit loud and I had a hard time hearing my friend sometimes. Our table was super close to two other tables so I was a bit bothered but not so much.\n\nI was starving so I munched on so much of the complimentary chip and salsas. They provide you with 3 types of salsa and they're all unique in their taste and spiciness. Although the orange one was yummy, it was too spicy for my liking so I stuck with the green salsa. You can tell the quality of the chip is freshly made and they're the thin type so it's not too filling.\n\nThe water here tasted really good, too, almost like mineral water..\n\nMy best friend who has been here many of times before said she always got the Tropisueno Camarones (shrimp dish w/ rice). However, this time, she did notice that the sauce was less thick and less filling so she was able to finish it, unlike previous times. It was still good for her, but not as good as before.\n\nGoing away from my bff's suggestion and trying to be healthy, I got the Salm\u00f3n En Hoja De Platano and it was similar to my friend's dish but with salmon on a banana leaf. I thought the salmon was delicious but everything else on the plate was weird tasting for me and it didn't go well with the salmon so I finished only the salmon portion. \n\nI love Mexican food but I was a bit let down by the overall taste blending of all the ingredients on this plate. Maybe if I had another opportunity, I would just get what my friend suggested. We spent about $25 each after tax and tip, and I don't think it was worth it.\n\nCheck out their happy hour Mon-Fri 4-6 PM!", "author": "Minh-An C."}

After work on a Wednesday night, the place was crowded and we had to wait a good half an hour before getting seated.  What was odd was that the waitress asked us, before even leading us to our table, if we were ok with limiting our dinner to an hour and a half because there were reservations and they were running behind.  It put us a bit off, but it wasn't a huge deal and we agreed.\n\nThe restaurant/bar is smaller than I would have expected it to be, but they decorate the interior in a fun yet neat way.  It had a cool, fun and new atmosphere.  The drinks were very strong (I heard each had 2 tequila shots). Overall we all ordered multiple drinks and had a great time. We continued to sit, drink and flag him down for more drinks, but never once did he ask if we were ready to our dinner orders.  45 minutes had gone by until he finally came by to see what we had wanted. We didn't mind so much because we were having a good time catching up and talking, but if the restaurant had gone through the trouble to ask us to shorten our stay, they didn't seem to put in the effort to follow through. \n\nThe food arrived in a decent time after placing our orders.  Everything was delicious as were the drinks. I had a chicken plate and my meat was so wonderfully flavored as well as tender and juicy.  I also usually don't like black beans or pickled radish, but both were absolutely tasty.  I believe everyone's food and drink were great as well.\n\nAnother mishap was that a friend had ordered a drink, but it never came.  By the time we had finished eating, it still hadn't arrived and he didn't think it was worth to ask again.  Though the food and drink are well worth 4-4.5 stars, their service is pretty poor and they obviously don't know how to cater to the customer. \n\nI may return just because I had a great time, with great eats in a cool place, but the service is a bit weak.\n\nAtmosphere: 4/5\nFood and drink: 4.5/5\nService: 2/5\nOverall Experience: 3.5/5", "author": "Elizabeth L."}

If perceived quality alone could sell me, I would have stopped here in a heartbeat to see what all the fuss was about. After standing in line for not too long, we made it in to see the menu and proceed with our foray into superior Mexicana. \n\nThey serve everything you'd imagine a Mexican restaurant to have (no surprise) and quite a bit more. I hadn't seen tortas on any menu in a long time, and I was further inspired by trying the eponymous dish, so I ordered the - you guessed it - Tropisueno Torta, which was loaded with carne asada, grilled chicken, carnitas and chorizo. With the addition of a couple horchatas and guacamole dishes, we were ready for the feast. \n\nThe guacamole was perfectly consistent, savory, and dip-able, and the torta was fantastic. Sort of like a Mexican sloppy joe, but with none of the questionable quality, I couldn't help myself from devouring every morsel. Washing it down with some not-too-sweet horchata and sitting out in the California sunshine definitely helped shape my opinion as well.

There was only a 2 seat table available. They had a rope dividing the tables. Taqueria time only has like 5 tables. I guess when its dinner they remove the rope and all tables are available. SO the front desk guy tells us theres only that table and cant seat us in a larger table because that area is closed. It was 4 of us and he expected us to sit at a mini 2 chair table. Luckily there were good samaritans, young couple sitting in a booth and offered their table and they'd sit at the one available. So that there was a big no! The food isnt mexican authentic the rice tastes too can tomatoey, the beans taste canned too. I ordered enchiladas not to wow.

I came on a Friday evening before a Giants game (hoping to fill up and avoid buying overpriced food and drinks at the ballpark). We ordered fish tacos (3-4) and house margaritas (5), and unlimited chips and salsa came with the order. We were definitely starving, as we went through a lot of chips and salsa before our orders arrived. They provided a platter of three different types of salsa, which was delicious and generous on their part. \n\nSeating was unbelievably crowded - they roped off over half the restaurant either for cleaning or for non-happy hour patrons, I couldn't tell, so the only seating available was at the bar or on a long skinny bench across the bar. My friend and I had to request another group of patrons to rearrange their seating in order to squeeze in. As such, I'd highly recommend getting there early for happy hour and grabbing a seat immediately - it's free seating. We had to motion the waiters quite a few times to get food and water, but this was understandable as it was loud and crowded inside. The quality of the food made up for it. The margaritas weren't particularly amazing but they were incredibly strong - so if you're happy hour hopping I recommend sharing with a friend or sticking to Tropisue\u00f1o for the duration of your evening.

There is a nice patio area so we opted for this place but it wasn't clear we had to order inside (sort of like Chipotle style). So we reserved our seats outside and went inside to order. The menu is pretty large so I went with the grilled prawn plate which had salad, rice, beans, and shrimp. With a drink, I spent about $20. Not cheap for \"fast food\". Everyone else in our party got their food within 5 minutes but I didn't get mine until 25+ minutes later after I checked with an employee. The food was simple and tasty but my god, that wait was terrible. I'd pass, especially if you're in a rush.", "author": "Regina W."}

The carne asada burrito is my go to. The beef is perfectly seasoned and marinated. The burritos are massive and I guarantee that you will be full after your meal. \n\nWith every order they give you a side of their Cantina style tortilla chips. They have a salsa bar/ sauces for all of your salsa needs. My favorite salsa is the pico de gallo and their orange sauce. Its basically their own \"La Vic\" sauce. I think their orange sauce is better than La Vic's. More flavor and it has more of a kick.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-20", "description": "Made reservations here based on the volume of good Yelp reviews, but very disappointed. Taking a trip into the city, on a weekend night, fighting 101 traffic, finding parking downtown is already a challenge. Finding this restaurant for the first time, at night, without your cell gps telling you where it is ... also a big challenge. \n\nUpon entry, a line of about ten people. No hostess and no eye contact from serving staff. Very busy, peak dinner service, I get it. Not worried since we have a reservation. Hostess finally returns and seats us right away. Table for two in the corner, but seating is extremely tight. I could bump elbows with the woman sharing the benched against the wall seating next to me if I ate left-handed. Oh and because of that our conversation could not be at all private, so we kept it to chit chat and about the food and drink.\n\nHusband requested ice water while we were deciding on apps... We got room temp flat water. Ok, we will ask our actual waiter when he comes. The chips and salsa were very good... Freshly baked and perfectly salty with three salsas to choose from. I could eat just this and be perfectly happy, honestly. We ordered empenadas, guacamole, and chicken flauta appetizers and each a margarita. It was about ten minutes until we got our drinks and guacamole. House margarita was fine. The guacamole was a little on the small side, but very good and flavorful. Not too chunky not too creamy, just right. The empenadas were too cheesy gooey on the inside for my liking, but the flautas were good. Crispy on the outside and the chicken very tender on the inside and the sauce was pretty good.\n\nUpon the waiter return we placed our dinner order for enchiladas nopales and my husband ordered shrimp sauteed with onions in a red sauce (not sure menu name). He also, again , asked for ice water and some tortillas and a side of cheese. We both ordered drink refills. Here is where dinner service began its steep decline. We waited what seemed forever for our food. In the meantime, another lukewarm glass of water with no ice is delivered to the table. Ok, so if you want ice, order a margarita. Note taken. But wait, here comes a drink... Only one? Before we can ask, that server is off and running, probably from the angered look on my husbands face... Neither of us want our warm water, and now only one of us has a cold drink. So we share it . Not much fun. But I digress. \n\nDinner plates are finally delivered... Well mine is a dinner plate. My husbands is an appetizer? Um all he has had so far is a bit of guac, the two empanadas and a margarita... And he is looking at six smallish shrimp in some sauce. They hand him a towel, which turns out has the tortillas... But he can fit all the shrimp in one tortilla, so he was not happy. He made it work into two, so it was more like a meal, but not really. No cheese to be found and no second drink for me... Oh did I mention we were here to celebrate my birthday? \n\nMy enchiladas probably would have tasted a lot better, if I didnt have an unhappy husband, an empty cocktail glass and no server in sight... and rightfully so. The service was not on point, not delivering what is ordered, not informing the small size of the shrimp and no ice, no cheese, no margarita, and no waiter to relay this to because he doesnt check back. By the time he comes over with a complimentary dessert, proceeds to sing happy birthday with my husband... Which ok thank you. And which in theory is a nice gesture, but I happen to be allergic to strawberries so I could not even sample it, lol. Sorry, but those of us with food allergies know how frustrating this can be. it was not worth even saying anything but thank you at that point. We were done and ready to go home. \n\nWhen he did bring the bill, I did address him saying, I hope there was no cheese and no second margarita for me since they were never delivered. Oh, no they are not on the bill, he says... but the cake is on me... Um okay. So what you are saying is you never ordered it so thats why we never got it. Makes sense, but we should overlook that for the free cake and song... Mmm no. \n\nIt was so not worth $100 before the tip. About 25% overpriced based on the poor service level. My husband would have been happier taking me to Chevys, getting fast service and only a tab of $75 with tip. But he wanted to do something nice for my birthday. Plus add the thirty minute drive into the city  and the SF weekend night parking fees. Just saying. No matter how good some of the food may be here, you need wait staff to support the prices you are demanding. Only when you have that will you get these customers to return.

Walked by a few times and it was always full and had a wait. The decor inside is pretty nice, with a lively atmosphere and warm soft lighting. The seats are a little crowded--you can hear the folks talking in the other tables because they sit so close to you, but it's SF so that's fine. The wait staff are also pretty nice and professional. You even get a candy at the end :)\n\nThe food itself is also pretty good. The chips/appetizer had 3 kinds of dip, and each was pretty interesting, especially the orange one--had a kick to it. For the main meal I got the seafood soup. When I ordered it the waiter said it was \"spicy\", and man, was he right! It was SO spicy I had trouble talking, even with water. So if you like spicy, this is the soup for you.\n\nIn terms of price, the place is ok. The price is a little high, but was worth it (the seafood soup had a lot of seafood, like large chunks of scallop etc).\n\nOverall, a pretty good place for a meal or hang out in the bar area.", "author": "Henry L."}

The lunch taqueria is absolutely delicious and filling.  This time around, I was able to go to Tropisueno for dinner without realizing that the menu for lunch and dinner are completely different.  \n\nI like the fact that they \"transform\" into a modern Mexican restaurant for dinner with traditional plates as well as excellent dinner plates.  The appetizers all looked delicious as well.\n\nMy wife and I spit the appetizer and the main meal.  I remembered that the servings here were big so we didn't want to be overstuffed plus they start your meal off with the best tortilla chips you will ever have.  They are light, crispy and perfectly salted, they come with 3 excellent salsa's that range from Hot to Standard, the orange one (hot) is my favorite as the heat isn't overpowering (keep in mind, I like spicy food), but, leaves a great flavor with the heat.  For my wife who doesn't like spicy food, the orange was too hot but the green and red were excellent.  The red one has a small kick to it, but, nothing overpowering.  The green one was excellent as it tasted extremely fresh.  We added on a guacamole because I remembered how much I like it and how fresh it was.  They add jalapeno and cilantro, which I generally don't like in my guacamole but we weren't disappointed. \n\nFor appetizer, we had the Platanos Fritos and the Empanadas De Hongos.  We both loved the Platanos and my wife was not a fan of the Empanadas, however, I didn't think they were great but I enjoyed them.  We finished the Platanos, but, not the Empanadas.\n\nFor dinner, we split the Tampique\u00f1o and it was excellent.  The steak was cooked perfectly with an excellent seasoning.  I mixed it with the pinto beans, mexican rice and guacamole and absolutely loved it.  The beef enchilada was very good as well, I love the dough (?) they use to make the enchilada, its a little dense but extremely tasty.\n\nI can't wait to go back the next time I am in San Francisco, I highly recommend it as it is an excellent Mexican restaurant.", "author": "MichaelAnthony C."}

They have a wide range of different salsas which all are pretty good and two are on the spicier side. They have outdoor seating and are pet friendly.  The service is really good if you ask for something they are on top of it. The things keeping me from giving 5 stars is the salsa bar is small only accommodates one person at a time unless you know the person you can butt elbows to grab salsa and the lack of flavor on the fish tacos.", "author": "Miguel C."}

I've been waving the flag for margaritas for a long time since it is THE most popular drink in the country.  Thus when I got there, I was quite surprised at how uncrowded it was.  We sat outside in their \"patio\", if you think a bunch of tables and chairs in that walkway count as a patio.  Since it was happy hour the crowds did build up and since the happy hour order deadline was 5:45pm, my group was itching to get our final orders in before the window closed.  After multiple times trying to find a server to take our order, we did indeed find someone to put in orders for a fish taco, nachos, ceviche, and guacamole.  The food was OK, decently cheap and not really authentic.  \n\nI probably should try their regular menu on another visit but for now, they stay at this rating.", "author": "Ben H L."}

I noticed that this Mexican place had some great reviews. It is located on Yerba Buena street on the rear side of the hotel, which was very convenient. I got there at about 9:15 PM on a Tuesday night. (They close at 10 PM). There are lots of tables there but I chose to sit at the bar instead of being \"seated\". The bartenders there were very nice and helpful. There was also a ?manager? walking around and asking the customers how everything is going, which was nice to see. I ordered three pastor tacos (about $17) which come with rice and beans. I ordered a Modelo Negro which they had on draft (about $7). The food came out fairly quickly in about 10-15 minutes. The food was really good. I am a fan of Mexican food and this place was very good. I was in and out of there in about 30 minutes which is always a plus.

The drinks are semi-pricey but they are worth it. The margs are almost all $10, there is one that's $14. The other cockies are between $11-$14, but they really are such thoughtfully crafted drinks with lovely combinations. They have a special salt rim paired with each tequila-based cocktail and these drinks really pack a punch too. I may or may not have gotten an insider tip that while the Marg de la Casa is in a pint glass and the others are in small rock glasses, the Casa has less alcy-hol lol. Don't ask how I found that out, but let's just be clear, I didn't drunkenly ask, ok? Rude. \n\nI had the Tropisueno margarita and it was great and sour and bitter just like I like my men. Rachel, the bartender, suggested the Violeta next so I took her recommendation and it was a lovely sweet reprieve for my bitter soul and palate. \n\nI got the nopales enchiladas and they were fab. These ain't your madre's enchiladas, but they are delicious and double-stuffed!  I only finished a little less than half the food on my plate. The corn sauce on these enchiladas is great.  Next time I want to try their Mole.  My compadre, Stephanie, got a combo plate with a taco and enchilada.  I'll toss a link to her review once she posts :)\n\nChips and salsa were great, the orange salsa is delish, just like everybody says, but my favorite was the red because it was fire-roasty, with just the right amount of heat.\n\nI would make a reservation if I could next time.  When I got there, around 6 on a Wednesday, there were plenty of tables, but my girlfriend was running a little late, and when she got there around 6:30, the place had totally filled up.  I originally planned to just sit and wait for my friend and have a drink at the bar but when Rachel asked if I wanted to order food and I told her I was waiting on somebody, she stuck a menu and napkin on the place setting of the empty stool next to me.  That was really nice of her and even though I had envisioned us getting a table, I changed my mind and decided to take her up on her offer to save the seat for my friend because it was obvious that she was going to give great service.  And she totally did.  \n\nShe is so awesome, I would honestly return to Tropisueno just for her.  Sitting at the bar, I could hear other patrons talking about how lovely she is too. Her male counterpart, a heavy-set guy with a beard and mustache, who was making drinks for the restaurant, not the bar, was much more aggressive than he needed to be.  I witnessed several people try to order a drink from him (maybe because he is making drinks behind a bar...you know, like a bartender...) and he was pretty short with them in informing them that he was not available to help them.  He also scolded me for holding a seat for my friend, but it wasn't even my intention to hold the seat.  Luckily Rachel interjected and threw me a bone. Thanks Rach!", "author": "Emma H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "description": "What's not to love about a restaurant that, for under/around $20, will give you enough food to last TWO meals??\n\nTropisueno accomplishes this by loading you up on chips and three different types of salsa before a waiter ever comes around to take your order.  Seriously.  The chips are thin, crispy, and lightly salted, while each of the three salsas has a distinct color, texture, flavor, and level of spiciness.  Green was the most mild, red kicked it up a notch, and the orange one had me reaching for my glass of water.  My friends and I must have gone through a basket by the time someone came around to take our order, and then another before our order came out.  We came for dinner on a Thursday night, though, and were fine with the wait because it provided us ample time to catch up.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\nJacque C:\npozole vegetariano - 12\n\nIona C. (Me):\ncombo 2 - 12.95\ncarnitas enchilada & chicken tamale\n\nLisa L:\ntropiseuno margarita - 10\nsopa de pollo - 12\n\nBoth the pozole and sopa came with rice, while my Combo 2 order came with rice and a choice of beans (I opted for black beans).\n\nAs I mentioned before, with my stomach already half full of chips and salsa, I knew I had to be strategic about what I would eat there at the restaurant, choosing to eat things that would probably not be in great shape the next day for lunch.  I ended up picking my way through the rice and beans, and then taking the enchilada and tamale to-go.  \n\nI tend to prefer to eat jasmine rice that is still somewhat chewy/al-dente, as it's the kind of rice my mom would make with a variety of Filipino dishes growing up.  I find soggy, soft rice is anathema to me.  While the red rice at Tropisueno was softer than what I usually prefer, it wasn't soggy, and it had a lot of great flavor.  The simple black beans were just what I wanted in terms of having a counterpart to the richness of my combo items and the rice.\n\nAs for the carnitas enchilada and chicken tamale... I nuked them for two minutes on high and they were still really good.  I appreciated the corn meal to meat ratio in the tamale, just about even.  Both the chicken and the carnitas were well-seasoned.  The corn tortilla pretty much fell apart, but that was to be expected.  Mixing it into the carnitas was an easy fix, and I still enjoyed it a lot.\n\nTropisueno was packed when we came for dinner, and I think we narrowly avoided having a long wait for a table.  Next time around, I will definitely try to make a reservation.   Yes, I am very much looking forward to another food-venture here (perhaps with a $5 Happy Hour margarita).  ;)", "author": "Iona C."}

Lunchtime gets extremely busy, and I will say I was able to take advantage of being a solo diner and easily snagged a spot at the bar. For larger groups, it would probably be hard to eat here at lunch. Nonetheless, the line to order moved quickly and my food came out in a reasonable timeframe. I ordered two tacos (one fish, one al pastor), one enchilada (chicken tinga), and a side of guac. The fish taco was not quite worth the $5 price tag but the al pastor was amazing! The enchilada also had a nice amount of heat and didn't rely on being smothered in cheese to be tasty (unlike a lot of places back home).\n\nEvery order gets a basket of chips and access to the salsa bar, which has plenty of yummy selections for all palates. Overall, I would probably give the food 4 to 4.5 stars, but the service I received on my visit gets an extra star. First, I decided to order a margarita at the bar, and upon looking at my ID, the bartender gave me a comp tequila shot (of surprisingly good quality) because \"we were born a month apart and happy belated birthday.\" It was a bit aggressive for lunch, but it was free and I didn't have to work, so the gesture was much appreciated! Then, my food runner accidentally brought out two orders of guacamole when I had ordered one, and when I pointed it out, said that I was welcome to have the second one free of charge.

I thought it was more of a traditional restaurant setting because it looked like it was everytime I'd pass by it, plus since they take reservations in the evening.  So, I chose to meet my aunt there for a lunch break.  \n\nI got there around 11:45 and there was a line out the door.  I was thinking was this to get seated?  I did see what looked like an unmanned host stand. Turns out it was to order.  It's set up cafeteria like style like traditional taquerias.  Menu is posted a little before you order and then they get your order then you pay and get your number to sit at the table and they bring it to you.  If you want a bar drink you have to stand in yet another line to order that at the bar.  My aunt got the tamale plate with more rice no beans and I got the carnitas burrito.  The total after tax was around $19.  \n\nThe wait wasn't long for our dishes and chips to be brought to us. I was a little turned off that they served me my guacamole in a little container vs putting it in the burrito but we ended up using the majority for our chips.  She said her tamale was fine, which means average.  I thought my burrito was good as the meat was moist and it was still a good size.  I ended up asking for more foil to take half home.  The chips were nicely salted and fried.  Definitely not a bad option if you want something a little less pricey in the area.  I still like Gordo's more for burritos due to price and quality but I wouldn't mind coming back to Tropisueno, especially when I'm not on a time crunch to enjoy one of their margaritas.  3ish for now.", "author": "Cat C."}

There are typical taquerias in San Francisco, and then there are upscale Mexican restaurants. This is the latter (though it moonlights as a taqueria during the day). I've been to Tropisue\u00f1o for both dinner and daytime taqueria, so I'll review both. \n\nOverall, the food and service are both incredible and the ambience is always fun and upbeat. The only downside is there are only 2 bathroom stalls, one for men and one for women, so you can imagine how long the wait can be if it's packed (and it's always packed)\n\nThe Food Overall\nChicken fajitas are delicious, not too greasy and the flour tortillas are cooked perfectly. The salsas are incredible and the chips are great.\n\nDinner\nTropisue\u00f1o is incredibly busy for dinner. I can't stress the need for reservations enough, they often won't have any available reservations at all between 530 and 9 (dinner starts st 5:30pm), and I've even seen it have no reservations available for days on end. They also do drop-ins, but you can wait more than an hour. it's fairly dark inside - both bar and table seating available with great ambience. Expensive drinks (~$11 for a margarita) and the food is fairly pricey, but the portions are huge and it can definitely be shared. I've had taco combinations plates and chicken fajitas - they're both good but I'd recommend the chicken fajitas. Rice and your choice of beans are included, and the price is $13.95. 3 flour tortillas are included, and this is enough to fill 2 people (unless you eat like a horse).\n\nSalsa and chips are complimentary. There are 3 main types of salsa provided and they're all delicious. The orange salsa is vaguely cheesy and spicy, it seems like habanero, and I could eat it forever. If you're a fan of spicy, you absolutely have to try it.\n\nTaqueria\nTropisue\u00f1o does not take reservations for the taqueria lunchtime (which is before 4pm on weekdays and 5pm on weekends). Dinner starts at 5:30pm but the same menu is available during the day. The only difference is you're not waited on, you order food at the kitchen counter and take a number. Drinks are also ordered at the bar. Salsa and chips are still complimentary, but the salsa is serve yourself style.", "author": "Taylor S."}

Happy Hour is a great deal for some good house margaritas on the rocks or some cerveza.  The chips come with three different dipping sauces which are delish.  The orange one is really hot!

Finally we were asked if we wanted to speak to the manager John and we wanted to explain how upset we were. Then this guys shows up and rambles something about the food coming, didn't even bother to let our table talk and say anything and didn't even bother to apologize he spoke so fast and left so incredibly fast that it was imposible to understand, turns out that was the manager of the restaurant-JOHN.\n\nHonestly this was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life, the people didn't care, their excuse to things were \"something was broken\" and despite taking forever with the food they even managed to get the orders wrong. I will never in my life be coming back to this place, the customer service is horrible especially from the restaurants own manager.", "author": "Allie A."}

The cuisine isn't anything mind blowing, but you can expect solid Mexican food in a fun -- albeit noisy -- atmosphere. Although the restaurant is large, it attracts the post-work crowd and fills up pretty quickly, so I would suggest making a reservation ahead of time. \n\nI ordered the salmon baked in a banana leaf (super moist and flavorful), as well as the sides (black beans, rice). It managed to be delicious and fairly healthy at the same time. The server told me it would take ~30 minutes but it actually came out with all the other food. Would definitely order it again. The salsa they give you when you sit down is great, but the pink one is extremely spicy so be careful! I will need to venture back for happy hour one of these days.", "author": "Valerie L."}

I came back for the lobster / seafood soup and it was surprisingly delicious. I had huge doubts - any restaurant in Union Square is a red flag since you're typically paying the tourist fee. But the food and wine were really quality, a bit on the pricey end but still worthwhile.\n\n* GUACAMOLE ($7) 3.5 STARS:\nPretty good and fresh (tastes like what I make at home), but it was TINY! The chips are incredibly fresh and crunchy, and they offer 3 types of complimentary salsa. Nice way to start, but if you're looking for a good guacamole, I'm embarrassed to admit I really like Rosa Mexicano's.\n\n* CALDO DE MARISCOS ($19) - 4.5 STARS: \nSeafood soup with large shrimp, calamari, sea scallops, mussels and fresh fish in a lobster-chile broth topped with crispy tortillas. I've lots of Mexican soups, from upscale to hole in the wall and while I really appreciate every style and version, none of them have been particularly high quality. This on the other hand was flavorful and fresh - the broth was the big stand out, and there was a generous amount of really fresh seafood.

While my bf and I were in the area and looking for a place for dinner, we stumbled upon this restaurant. He's always down for Mexican food, and I'm not too picky in trying new places. We entered into a dimly lit restaurant, and was quickly seated amongst the busy crowd. We were offered a complimentary nachos and three types of dips (the orange spicy kind was my bf's favorite- he literally had like 6 small servings of that).\n\nATMOSPHERE: A fun, intimate, upscale atmosphere but attire can range from casual to business casual. It's feels sort of cramped in there, but not squished. Busy, so it can get pretty loud. Great place for groups of friends, coworkers, and family, GNO, drinks after work, etc.\n\nSERVICE: Attentive and accommodating.\n\nFOOD: I ordered the Chicken Mole and the portion was huge!!

She saved me a seat and ordered a lot of food and a drink while waiting for me. He told her repeatedly and unprofessionally that she couldn't save the seat and was preventing him personally from making money. Well guess what Sergio... you not only prevented yourself from making money but the owners as well. Lost business forever. I sat down 5 minutes before happy hour ended and wasn't served or asked if I wanted a drink. Others came up to the bar after me and were served ahead of me (while I was trying to get his attention as he was directly in front of me).

For American-style Mexican food, I would venture elsewhere or you may disappointed from an underwhelming experience. \n\nFood\nWe ordered a few dishes and every single one was bland and salty. I had the chicken enchilada and pork tamale. Both tasted basically the same and my tamale was really hard like it was premade and had just been heated up. The enchilada was also not fresh. The rice was really salty and over seasoned - my friends all agreed. And the 3 salsas they served with the complimentary chips looked nice in various colors, but didn't have distinguishable flavors. Each tasted a little spicy and not very fresh. My friend had the camarones (prawns) dish which came in a soupy reddish color sauce and not much else except for the rice and beans. \n\nService\nThe service was okay. The hostess was prompt and kind, but our server wasn't very friendly. She also disappeared in the middle of our meal and we had to flag someone else down for water. It was a little odd. It wasn't the worst but certainly wasn't anywhere near good. \n\nAmbience\nThis is a noisy place, especially during dinner hours, as many of the patrons are at the bar drinking and chatting.

We also chose a Friday lunch to try this place so I'm sure it's a bit crazier. So you see the menu ahead of time and order when you get to the counter and then your food is delivered. If you want a margarita you have to order from the bartender. Prices seem reasonable (for the food- my margie was $10!) , and their menu is extensive.\n\nSo, seating is first come, first served. This is especially annoying when people come in large groups. I actually witnessed a guy hogging a table of 12, who sat there from the time I arrived to the time I left. Please do the rest of us a favor and don't come with more than 5 people. I could have eaten my meal there instead of circling the restaurant for 10 minutes.\n\nThe order- margarita, carnitas taco, and carna asada super taco. I'm pretty sure that was the right move. Do yourself a favor and check out the salsa bar- lots o' goodies in there. Everything was delicious and I think I hoovered it up in about 10 minutes.\n\nWe'll be back- they have a Happy Hour!", "author": "Alyssa J."}

The service, the food, the prices.. all on point (on point = well executed). \n\nLunchtime = cantina style! Cantina style is mexican for going up and ordering at the counter similar to cafateria style. Note that burritos are only served during lunchtime (even though it's one of Trop's best items). I suggest the Mojado Burrito (~$10) if you like it wet and flavorful. \n\nService: Everyone's no nonsense which I like (?). For dinner, the waitress told me to go drink at the bar to wait for my party. The bartender told me to update my ID picture. When the rest of my party came, the waitress told me to close out my bar tab and bring my beer to the table (Modelo Negro was ~$4 during HH btw). From this experience, I learned I'm really, really good at following directions. More importantly, I didn't really have to think about anything other than what I wanted to eat. \n\nFood: Everyone talks about the food so I'm not going to bore anyone with the details. Definitely order the guac and hit the Mole if you're into that. Everything on the menu is solid. I. mean. everything. FYI - the cheese tamale isn't vegetarian because they add secret goodness into the maize. ;)\n\nLocation: Yerba Buena, Westfield Mall, Metreon, tourist stuff, etc. Needless to say it's an awesome location that's easily accessible by bike, BART, MUNI, pretty much anything.. Keep in mind the restaurant is located in between the Powell and Montgomery street stations. \n\nOther suggestions: This would be a cool first date place on a weekday, if you're into that. Good food, full bar, loud enough of a restaurant so there's never really an awkward silence and tons of options in the area to hit up. \n\nTropisueno is highly raved and for good reason. It's definitely a must-try.", "author": "Chris W."}

My boss and I had talked about getting margaritas the previous day after a tough afternoon.  So it seemed a great convenience this was close by.  The place is packed and busy.  We originally put our name down for a 30 minute wait, but a spot by the bar area opened up and we grabbed it.\n\nAfter a couple of margaritas each, we were ready for food.  I got the Caldo De Mariscos (seafood soup with large shrimp, calamari, sea scallops, mussels and fresh fish in a lobster-chile broth topped with crispy tortillas).  Although nothing particularly special about it, I thought it was a fine meal.  Nice heat to it and I thought it was a nice complement to the margaritas.  My boss got the Chile Verde\n(tender pieces of pork simmered in tangy tomatillos, green peppers, chiles and herbs. house favorite.)  He seemed to like it - finished it all.\n\nOverall a good experience. Our waiter was a bit forgetful as we had to remind him on a couple of things - water, another round of margaritas, a beer order.  But he was a nice guy.  Other than that, nothing to complain about here.", "author": "Thai N."}

I was expecting a reasonable, if not authentic Mexican meal, and a Vancouver sized drink (read: small). Try again, expectations!\n\nI walked in at about 4.30pm, hungry and thirsty. I didn't realise that they were gearing up for their transition from taqueria to full service restaurant, so that probably explains why the hostess was zipping around and not immediately able to help me. Once I grabbed her she quickly explained that I just needed to go to the window, order, grab a number and pay before finding a seat. Ohhh I get it now, so simple (cut me some slack, my brain was working backwards after a week of amazing and intense learning, and a nasty cold working it's way through my body.)\n\nI ordered a chicken enchilada plate and found a spot at the bar to tuck myself into. Once I'd squeezed in I ordered a margarita from Ale, the lovely bartender, and moments later my food arrived! I was super impressed with the speed, although my delight faded for a moment as I realised I need to wiggle back out of my seat to grab cutlery and salsa! (Ale came to the rescue on the cutlery, but couldn't reach the salsa for me!) I loaded up on three delicious salsas and mowed down on some fan-freaking-tastic food! \n\nThe food was way more authentic than most I've had in Van, and a giant portion! I only got one enchilada and I was super stuffed. Not that that stopped me from eating the complimentary tortilla chips and salsa that were delivered in front of me... \n\nThe first margarita I got was huge - a 16oz glass filled with ice and delicious booze and oh boy was it good! I really enjoyed it and can't believe it was only $10! The second one was half the size, but stronger - the rose salt rim was tasty, and the ginger was a nice touch although it could have been stronger (but I REALLY like ginger!)\n\nThis place was really excellent and I can't wait to go back next time I'm in SF!", "author": "Ayla C."}

I did not put in reservations, so I expected a wait, and there was one, but it was minimal.  We were shown to a dark little corner booth and given chips and sauces. They were spicy but GOOD. I especially liked the Avacodo/cilantro/lime and the roasted jalapeno ones. \n\nWe placed our orders for the Tres.. Yeah, The three pork dish and the 2 platter. I chose the steak taco and the chicken flauta. It didn't take them long to put the food on the table either!

Each of our mains was served with seasoned black beans and Spanish rice.  \n\nThe spice on each dish was good. Even my husband, who eats ghost peppers for fun, was saying how much he liked the heat. Me, it was a bit warm, but I survived. And I enjoyed the experience.  We were both able to eat the proteins but not the filler, and that's OK!  This meant that we still had a bit of room for dessert.\n\nAh! Dessert.. Original flan was our choice, it came to us, beautifully presented, topped with caramel sauce and strawberries. This consistency was more like cheese cake, but OH MY! The flavour was divine, and when you ate it with a strawberry, it was utter perfection!  I have to say, I was delighted. \n\nBut the reason I took off a star and didn't give it 5: Canned coke at $2?  Iced tea at $4? That's just ridiculous. They have a bar.. they should have coke on tap. And in what planet does iced tea - even the two they serve cost that much. That's just a gouge. Stick with water or alcohol if you're drinking. \n\n\nAlso be aware, it is -very- dark in some areas.

Definitely boozy, I had two and I was funked up. \n\nThose chips and salsa. DAMN YOU, you chips and salsa. You are the bane to my existence. I just CAN'T STOP EATING YOU. Those salsas were just so spicy and flavorful to boot. Feckin' a. Bonus: ask for the habanero salsa, it will get your taste buds going. The bartender offered it up after my brother and I basically told him were inhuman when it comes to spice and just to bring it on! He did.\n\nNo need for apps here since I ate a bag of chips and salsa. I opted for the two enchilada combo plate. I absolutely loved that they let me order different ones! I opted for the chicken tinga in rojo and the chile verde in verde sauce. Throw a crap ton of rice and beans in to the dish and there you go. So.Much.Food. I wish I could tell you I didn't finish it, ::sigh::. I ate it all (actually, I spied a few black beans and rice on the plate). All of this for like $15. DAYUM. Still more expensive than some hole-in-the-wall spot in the Mission, but this is the FiDI and it's trendy, yo!\n\nThe enchilada's were good. I preferred the chicken tinga more for the spice factor. The pork in the chile verde was so tender, but ultimately lacked the flavor that green chile is known for! Huge chunks of pork, though; no denying that.\n\nService at the bar was ah-mazing. If all servers were on top of it as mah dude at the bar, the world would be a better place. Friendly, quick, informative, fun and passionate about what he's doing and where he's working. I wish I got your name, since your manager needs to know!\n\nFood - 4 stars\nService - 5 stars\nAtmosphere - 5 stars. I like bustling restaurants that are loud and high energy, if this place was empty, I don't think I'd enjoy it as much!\nDrinks - 4 stars\n\nI'll definitely be coming again, fo' sho' when I've got some serious hunger pains and looked to satiate with some solid Mexican eats!", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

Order ur food, take the number, look for a seat and wait about 10-15mins for food. During lunch the Staffs are act super quick to clean up and bring chips to the table.  They are super friendly.  \nI ordered shrimp burrito and added guacamole $1.50 but I don't see and taste any guacamole in my burrito.  Since they r too busy I dont want to go up and ask.  so maybe Next time I won't add any guacamole in it. Beside the guacamole I'm happy with my meal.  Don't forget to get horchata.  I wasn't a fan of horchata until I got one from them.  It was delicious, the drink it wasn't too sweet and too rich of cinnamon which I love it.  \nAwesome to my tummy.

We were still talking and thinking about it for the next couple days after, but there are just too many food options in SF and we wanted to try other places during our short visit. Otherwise we surely would have returned again and again.\n\nTropisue\u00f1o is tucked away on Yerba Buena Lane, a pedestrian-only thoroughfare that is located on the backside of the Marriott Marquis. It's easy to miss since Tropisue\u00f1o is only lightly etched on the window, therefore look for the lit exterior sign that reads \"Mexican Kitchen\".\n\nI highly recommend making a reservation which you can do so on OpenTable. We weren't able to make a reservation since it was a Saturday night and very last minute and we therefore ended up testing our luck as a walk in customer. It was about a quarter after 7pm and the wait was about an hour.  They asked us to check in with them in about 30-40 minutes which worked out perfectly since it allowed us time to head over to Union Square to snap some photos of the Christmas tree and decorated Macy's building. We headed back in the time they suggested and were promptly seated 5 minutes later.\n\nShortly after being seated, they delivered complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were freshly made and thin, just the way I like it. There were 3 homemade salsas provided...chili diablo (spicy), tomatillo avocado (mild but flavorful) and roasted tomato (lightly smoky)...all delicious!\n\nMy brother and I started with Strawberry Margaritas which were disappointing. We both thought the drinks were rather sour with no strawberry flavor at all. But to be fair, I don't usually order margaritas or tequila-made drinks so maybe it was supposed to taste like that??? On a positive note, the drinks were pretty strong. I read a review where the reviewer said him and his wife each had 3 house margaritas and walked out with zero buzz. Either I'm truly weak sauce or was just lucky to have a bartender with a heavy pouring hand because I was warm & tingly after only half my drink.\n\nBut the main purpose of our visit wasn't to drink, but rather to eat. Therefore onto the food...\n\nI ordered the Camarones Tropisue\u00f1o. Large wild shrimp in a creamy chile de arbol sauce finished with tequila, lime and cilantro. WOW...the sauce of this dish was OMFG delicious!!! It stated on the menu it was supposed to be spicy. Perhaps because I really like spicy, I didn't think there was much heat but regardless, it was perfect in every way. I about licked my plate clean and was hoping for more. My brother said this is the dish he would order if we came back.  If you like seafood, then I highly recommend ordering the CAMARONES TROPISUE\u00d1O.\n\nMy brother ordered the Chicken with Mole Poblano. Leg and thigh braised in a traditional sauce made with dry chiles, spices, nuts, herb and chocolate. It was good. The chicken was moist and sauce well balanced.  Both entrees come with a side of rice and beans which you have a choice of pinto, white or black. They also provide fresh, warm tortillas.\n\nService was great!  The hostess was friendly and our server, Sergio, was helpful & attentive.\n\nTropisue\u00f1o will definitely be a must for me on any future SF trips. Without a doubt...5 stars!!!", "author": "Angela C."}

My first experience with chicken and mole did not go well, so I'm glad I didn't have to relive that night again.  The triple dip that went with the chips was somewhat unique.  I couldn't handle the spiciness but I still tried to eat as much as I could.\n\nService was good... until the end.  It was really obvious that they were trying to get us to leave.

They've got all your normal Mexican dishes, but also a surprising amount of seafood on the menu. The tortilla chips were thin and crispy and came with not one, not two, but THREE different colors of salsa! Their tortillas come wrapped in towels --\u00a0not foil\u00a0--\u00a0and you can get more for free! \n\nThey have pretty good service. Staff was friendly and helpful about menu questions. \n\nThe only downside is that it's a little on the expensive side ($13-20 per entree) and the place is insanely loud. You pretty much have to yell for the people on the other side of the table to hear. \n\nIf you come without a reservation, expect a 30-45 minute wait time. That's alright though, I just put down my phone number and walked around Yerba Buena Gardens for a bit. They send a text when your table is ready.", "author": "Kevin C."}

It's within walking distance of Yerba Buena Center, Moscone center and all the museums.  Now on to the food. They place a bowl of warm tortilla chips and salsa (3 flavors from mild to spicy) when You're first seated. I ordered the empanadas.  They came with a spicy sauce and cortido. It was light and very flavorful.  Also filled with veggies and no meat. (BTW this place has lots of vegetarian options from appetizers to main course). I then ordered the veggie Posole. It was filled with veggies and hominy with a perfectly chili flavored broth. I asked for lemon and it added just the right amount of zest. Seating was immediate although by the time I left it was getting full so if you're going after 6 I recommend making a reservation. The service was excellent.  Can't wait to return.

I ordered the nachos since I was feeling like snacking over an entree and a strawberry margarita. Ordering food is a little odd since you need to order your regular food and pay and get your #. Then, you go around to the bar to get your alcoholic beverage of choice. \n\nThe nachos were amazing with the carne asada I added to all the fixings- salsa, guac, sour cream and cheese galore. I couldn't even eat through half of it so I suggest ordering it with a friend or ordering a regular entree so you don't have a too large pile of chips covered in amazing-ness. \n\nMy margarita, on the other hand, seemed a bit off. My friend has a spicy strawberry margarita that he downed like water that had jalepenos to give it that extra kick. Mine was just ok. For $12, I either want it to be a little better than just ok, or be at some fancy bar.", "author": "Leina K."}

What started of with a 30 min wait and high expectations ended in me wondering if they give out free sombreros like Chevys...\n\n[Ambiance 3/5] While very cliche, the decor wasn't that bad. It felt like you were in a slightly cleaner, slightly more upscale Chevys... or a stereotypical cantina\n\n[Service 4/5] The service was probably the one redeaming quality of Tropisueno. Our server was very friendly, joked around with my friend and I, and was fairly attentive throughout the meal. She checked on us several times, and made sure our water was always filled.\n\n[Food 2/5] The highlight was probably the free chips and salsa... although the salsa was extremely bland and had no bite whatsoever. Given I wasn't at a taqueria, I decided to go for a more conventional dish and ordered the mole. While I wasn't expecting spectacular, hours over a pot mole, I was extremely disappointed with the dish. The mole came out cold and lacked any sort of complexity. It seemed to have a fairly mundane single note of cacao. The chicken was overcooked and didn't fall off the bone. And worst of all, it seemed like they microwaved a stack of tortillas before bringing them to the table. The tortillas were stuck together and mushy, resulting in them falling appart when trying to remove them from the towel. I guess it didn't matter that much, seeing as there was barely any mole on the plate to be sapped up by the tortilla...\n\n[Value 3/5] While I was extremely disappointed by the mole, I was surprised that the prices weren't that bad, given their downtown SOMA location. And seeing as there's always a line out the door, either they're known for the cliche staples of burritos and enchiladas, or their drinks must be so strong that the food no longer matters. Either way, Tropisueno is not the place to go to if you're looking for proper Mexican food, but may have other redeeming factors which I have yet to discover.", "author": "Francis D."}

I loved the chips and salsa guy & I loved our sweet waitress but that's where the love ended. \n   My husband and I both ordered the \"seafood caldo\"\n(Seafood soup) and it was missing one major ingredient... SEAFOOD!! It really should have been called fish and garlic soup. Almost every spoonful of soup I ate was just garlic and fish. There was literally ZERO shrimp in my soup so my waitress had the manager bring me four. LOL! I cannot make this stuff up. I really thought I was gonna get a giant bowl of amazing caldo de 7 mares or some crazy Mexican chiopinno but it was a $20 bowl of fish & garlic soup. This place fell very short of its 4 stars. If you San Franciscoans want real Mexican food, go elsewhere! FYI...Mexican food costs very little money to make. You're getting ripped off here! I could've made a giant pot of seafood caldo for the $50 we paid for fish & garlic soup.", "author": "Patricia J."}

As my friend said, \"it's a good first date spot.\" And that's about as good as it got for me. We were here for dinner and our plates came out 75% covered with a boring spanish rice and \"sat-under-the-heat-lamp-too-long-and-now-there's-a-crust-over-me\" beans. After a bit of excavating on my plate, I found my taco and flauta, as miniature as they could be, come out from the pile of rice and beans. Clever way to trick us into thinking we're getting more food, Tropisueno. But maybe I'm just a tough critic because my friends loved their food. They did get more \"meaty\" options such as the carnitas and steak, so who knows, maybe that tasted better too.\n\nI gave this place 3 stars because there were a few redeeming factors. I had chicken on my miniature taco and flauta, which was cooked very well and had great flavor. Too bad it lasted only two bites. Second, we had some of their cocktails, which were delicious. Highly recommend the Tropisueno margarita. Third, they serve you free chips and salsa almost the second your bottom touches your seat...so I can't complain about that. The trio of salsas that come with the chips is pretty good too.\n\nOverall, I'm not dying to come back to this place for the food, but I wouldn't mind coming back here for some pre-dinner drinks with friends.", "author": "Renu A."}

The staff who greeted us was very friendly, as well as everyone else throughout the night. The restaurant has a fun atmosphere, especially at night. However, the food was awful. I ordered the pick 3, and got a chicken tamale, taquito, and carne asada taco. The tamale and carne asada taco had no flavor, and the chunks of meat were so thick, making it hard to chew. The taquito was the only thing I liked, but that may or may not be because I put a bunch of salsa on it. Chips were good too, and they give you a little dish with 3 types of salsa to go with it. Overall I feel I wasted my money. Food did not taste authentic and ended up being disappointing.", "author": "Jacqueline D."}

There weren't any reservations available through their website at the time we wanted but we ended up getting a table at 7:00 p.m. on a busy, Wednesday night.\n\nThe food and ambiance is easily 5 STARS - I enjoyed everything about my house margarita, the carne asada tacos I ordered, and I loved the whole vibe and decor. However, what left much to be desired was the service. I know we didn't have a reservation, and that the restaurant was busy, but we were told by the hostess that they needed our table for a 8:15 p.m. reservation and that we would have to be done by then. I have NEVER been told this at any restaurant and was amazed at how aloof the hostess was about the whole thing. I was having dinner with an old friend and didn't want to rush with dinner, but I honestly felt like our whole experience there was totally rushed.\n\nWill I be back? Possibly - I did enjoy the food and drinks and it wouldn't be fair to not give Tropisueno another chance, but it'll be difficult to not keep this first experience in mind.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

Great food with some unusual extras that take the food to the next level - a huge assortment of different salsas, fried plantains and several kinds of beans, and things like mole, tamales and excellent seafood dishes raise this above a standard Mexican restaurant. \n\nBy day they are a counter restaurant, where you order your food at the counter and pay there, then choose your own table. The bar is open at lunchtime, but same deal, you go get your own drinks. They do bus and clean the tables at lunch. Dinnertime is a sit-down restaurant experience with servers and waitstaff. The menu is very similar but some things, like the plantains, are only available at dinner. Their chips (available all day) are really special, very light and crispy and delicious with all the amazing salsas. You can eat WAY too many of these chips!! Especially with their excellent cocktails - margaritas are very good and they have spicy ones that are a bit too drinkable for my own good. Great service too.\n\nThis place gets VERY busy, for good reason, so plan ahead. They do not take reservations at lunch so go early or late. They do take dinner reservations and you do need a reservation! Otherwise, plan on an hour+ wait at dinnertime, and longer on Fridays and weekends.

The dish consisted of nine shrimp in a creamy, spicy orange sauce with mexican rice and beans. The sauce was so tasty without being overly salty or spicy (if I could by just this sauce i'd probably put it on everything). The shrimp was cooked perfectly too and was not rubbery or chewy at all.\n\nThe second time I got the chicken in mole sauce that also came with rice and beans. There were two chicken legs and two thighs and was very tender. The chicken itself didnt have a ton of flavor but when paired with the mole sauce... wow it was damn good. Mole sauce was just right.\n\nI've also come here for lunch before and its similar to chipotle where they have all the food laid out and you can build your own plates, tacos, burritos. You also have the option of ordering a plate of something and they bring it to your table. The best thing is they have a salsa bar so you can get all the salsa you want (I love the orange one... so tasty!)\n\nI love this place... great drinks and great food. One of my faves in downtown SF.

The hostess seated us immediately as long as we agreed to be done within an hour and a half when a reservation was coming. I did end up spending my first 15 minutes there in line waiting for a bathroom because there were only 2, and they were single person. Even the kitchen staff were in line waiting to use it. When I got back to the table, they'd brought us chips with what they may consider salsa but more resembled 3 various hot sauces to me. \n\nI wish I would have better read the menu before we settled on eating here, because nothing really jumped out as fantastic or unique. Both my husband and I were underwhelmed with what we ended up getting and didn't even eat half. Also, the restaurant was SO LOUD. I couldn't hear anything my husband said even when I leaned in to hear him. We just stopped trying to even talk there because we would end up shouting and still had difficulty hearing each other. The music was just very loud and everyone else is shouting in their efforts to have a conversation with each other. Pretty sure this would be a one star option for a first date unless you sat outside. \n\nIt took awhile to get our bill after our waiter disappeared for a good amount of time (maybe he had to wait in the bathroom line too). When we signaled that we were ready he seemed pretty irritated and essentially threw some suckers and the bill at our table. It was busy and he might have been stressed and honestly we didn't care at that point because we just wanted out of there. \n\nWe had been so hungry we didn't scroll through all the reviews.

They have glasses of iced water but also offer cans (and some bottles) of soda. \n\nI grabbed a couple types of salsa but the one I really enjoyed was the only one with a label that said \"mild/med.\" The chips were that perfect middle group of crispy. They had a great crunch without being cut your mouth hard (that's what she said).\n\nMy food came out pretty quickly and I was shocked at how gigantic the burrito was.

This burrito definitely required a knife and fork.\n\nI had spent my morning walking all over the city so I was super hungry and...meh, it was kind of a let down. It was a terrible burrito but it wasn't a great one either. There aren't a ton of shrimp, which turned out to be a good thing.

The ceviche here is filled with tomato and avocado - in any case, it wasn't bad but it just wasn't my preference. The fish taco was tasteless and could've used extra lemon and fixin's.

So expect to wait without reservations.\n\nInside, they have adhered to the tropical dream theme.  The carnivalesque lights add to the festivities with all the green foliage and dramatic lighting.  I felt like I was in a fancy restaurant in Cabo walking in here.  The service is excellent whether sitting at table or dealing with the bartenders.  People are friendly and like to be here.  \n\nWe came in here last minute with our party of five, and they were able to seat us under the conditions of leaving in an hour and a half to accommodate another party.  We appreciated that and were able to enjoy our tasty meals and relax in good time. \n\nI ordered the Pollo Asado with black beans.  The portion size was massive.  I consumed as much as I could though and was sad I couldn't finish it.  The flavors were fresh and fun like a party in my mouth.  Some lucky homeless guy got the rest of my chicken.\n\nI can't remember what other members of the party ordered, but if clean plates mean anything- enough said.  \n\nTheir house margaritas (Margarita de la Casa) are great.  Unlike most Mexican joints, the house margaritas here are refreshing with a nice chile salted rim.  They are not weighed down with excessive amounts of sugar.  They also have about 130 different tequilas here for some of you tequila connoisseurs.  A nice shot of Grand Centenario will cost you $60.\n\nNothing but quality in here:  drinks, food, service, atmosphere and even pricing\nI would go out of my way and come to SF and enjoy the fiesta to be had in here.  -best exceptional experience for dining at a Mexican restaurant around!!", "author": "Elizabeth S."}

My friend and I got there around 7, and it was a 40 minute wait, so we opted to sit outside (which is a first come, first served basis). The service outside was pretty good, and luckily it wasn't too cold. Everyone immediately gets chips and salsa, which were pretty tasty. For my main dish, I got the salmon cooked in a banana leaf, and while it was cooked perfectly, there was way too much seasoning on it. That kind of killed the whole dish. I was also supposed to get flour tortillas on the side, but they never came. :( I feel like they would have soaked up the spices a little better. Anyway, this is just a typical Mexican restaurant; nothing really special or different about the food.", "author": "Rachel H."}

The waitress was pleasant and came to our table at all the right times without over-attending. Don't fall into the trap of gorging on the amazing salsas and chips that they constantly re-fill. My favorite salsa (of the three) is the slightly warm and spicy orange.\n\nPortions are huge! They can definitely last you two meals, especially if you're already partially full with salsa and chips...which you most likely will be. I ordered the \"Tres Cochinitas\" which was a three-combo Pork taco dish including Chile Verde, Al Pastor, and Carnitas. Really loved the Carnitas and Al Pastor; the chile verde meat was a little too fatty for me. \n\nThey offer options for refried beans, black beans, and Peruana beans. Try the Peruana! It is a mild-tasting white bean simmered in broth, bay leaves (?), and some spices. Very comforting side dish. \n\nDefinitely coming back to try the margaritas.", "author": "Arushi S."}

He told us we had to put our name on the list, and of course a long discussion came along after about what his host told us.\n\nEventually, they realized they made a mistake, and sat us right away. Well, service wasn't that great either. Its as if they put us in our corner, and purposely forgot about us. Until after we finally spoke up, and waiter came and told us he didn't know our table was his. Really?\n\nThe food was really good. I ended up getting the chicken poblano (?).\n\nInterior decor is nice, and seating isn't too bad, but it is small inside. \n\nIf the service was up to par, and we didn't have the little mishap in the beginning I would give it a five star.

The Wait: You're greeted at the door, asked for your name, etc. etc. The wait was about 30-45 minutes, so not terrible. And they text you when your table is ready. Why can't all restaurants do this? I'd rather have them text me than hand me a grimy buzzer or force my party to wait around in a confined space for extended periods. I was able to wander over to the Union Square during the wait.\n\n2. The Bar/The Alcohol: The bar is POPPING! Its a party up in there. The drinks had good flavor, but oh boy were they stronger than what I expected! I got whatever their \"lightest, fruitiest, sweetest drink\" was and that had me glowing in a few minutes. So all you light-weights out there like myself, be careful with those things. :) \n\n3. The Food: You get bottomless chips and an assortment of three dips - thats FRESH! How could I tell? All three dips come in one plate, but two of the three dips came out chilled every time, and the third dip (the red pepper one) came out hot. I appreciate that they're poured for every serve and not pre-prepped/sitting out.  \n\nI got the Enchiladas De Nopales - one veggie and one chicken all soaked in a creamy corn sauce (if you're picky about sauce-to-food ratios, may want to ask for it on the side). It was so delicious! Wish there was more chicken in that enchilada, but otherwise I have no complaints. Also, exxxxecellent beans and rice. \n\nI also tried the Salmn En Hoja De Platano, a salmon entree thats slow-cooked with pasilla peppers and onions in a banana leaf. ITS AMAZING!!! I ordered it medium-rare, and it simply melted in my mouth. I had no idea salmon could hold such a punch of flavor. It's a must-try. \n\n4. The Service: So friendly, genuine and attentive. My water glass was always topped and we were checked-in with at appropriate moments. I also received honest feedback on menu items, which is always appreciated...Shout-out to our awesome server RACHEL!!! :) \n\n5. The Price: Ouch. A bit high...I wouldn't come here for a casual dinner. But I still walked away feeling like the experience was well worth it. \n\n6. Other Tips: This is not the location to catch up with somebody you haven't seen in ages. If I recall correctly, you're given 1.5 Hrs to dine. \n\nI'll be back!", "author": "Clare S."}

It was around 9 pm but there were still several people waiting to be seated. Crazy on a Thursday night! I have been here a few times before but my man hasn't so I was excited to bring him here so he can try the food. The first thing he said walking - in was.. \"Baby, it smells good in here\". The hostess said there's a 35 minute wait but we didn't mind. We sat inside as we watch people coming in to the restaurant. People keep coming and it is passed 9:15! We both loved it since it gave him an impression that the food will be good. We got seated after 25 minutes. We started with the Platanos Fritos: Sweet, fried plantains, black beans, Mexican crema. They came up so warm and well cooked. So soft that it melts your mouth. The black beans were cooked so well; it didn't tasted bitter at all. \n\nThen we had the Ceviche De Camarones : white shrimp and sweet mango, cured in citrus with red onion, red pepper, cilantro, jalepeno. My bf really enjoyed this! The sourness of the mango with the freshness of the shrimp made it so tasty. \n\nThen we shared the 3-item Enchilada platter. Barbacoa of course! I only had one since it was sufficient enough for me. My bf ate the other 2 and inhaled it. It was SOOOOO GOOOOODDD!!! \n\nThe best part of this whole experience was our waitress who made our experience all worthwhile. Her name is Rachel. She's probably the best waitress we've ever had in SF so far. She's very hospitable, charming and quite engaged with us the whole time. (And she keeps saying that we looked cute together. Aww..)

Why oh why doesn't this place exist in Western NY!\n\nMy first visit was for lunch. I was instantly overwhelmed by the large menu full of delicious options, all of which I wanted to try. I settled on the regular tacos - meat of your choice, cilantro and onions. A perfect lunch order. At first, I thought, \"will this fill me up?\" Yes, it did. Plus, with a side of chips and their fresh salsas you can't go wrong. Ever! You grab the salsas yourself at a little serving station by the bar. I've never seen so many options. I favored the salsa verde. It had a subtle, but impactful kick of heat. Top some of that on the taco and you're good. \n\nI suppose it can be a hassle during the lunch rush trying to find a seat in this always-packed taqueria, but we had no struggles at all, landing a spot at a family style table, joining another group of coworkers.

Reminded me of Rick Bayless' shop in Chicago.\n\nIt's easy to get full of their FREE non-stop crispy and light tortilla chips with 3 home made salsas but don't!

A juicy and meaty Niman ranch bone in chop that's been brined with all sorts of Mexican flavor via chilies and spices to make it bright, vibrant, and porkie. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_EncdQezAzcShATMFXL0dA?select=9TgktVRTxaLmq1TXMiMk3g)\n\nI bartered some of my chop with my friends tampiqueno (flank steak) and chile relleno and those were really good too.(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_EncdQezAzcShATMFXL0dA?select=1IL1tUCbAab4M5GwUWuygw#1IL1tUCbAab4M5GwUWuygw)\n\nDefinitely a fan. The prices are good, the service friendly. Maybe because I wasn't  expecting it, they over-delivered.  \n\nWhat sets them over the top and I'm going to have to remember for next happy hour is that if you.....\"Invite 5 friends to drink at the bar, the host drinks for the whole evening for FREE!\"  Since we came as 6, I would have had drinks free.

I had to combo with a mole chicken enchilada - FANTASTIC! and a green chile cheese tamale - it was okay, but I would not order again.  \n\nFor dinner, I had the taco plate with one carne asada taco and one al pastor - both were excellent and would definitely order again.  We had the $7.50 guacamole appetizer - but was barely enough for one person - but still very good.  At dinner they provided chips and a sampler of 3 salsas - we had to have more salsa brought, every one of them was authentic and excellent.\n\nPS:  For outside diners during the day, BEWARE of the dive bomb pigeons who are very familiar with eating off plates.

With $6 house and strawberry margaritas available, Tropisueno was definitely calling my name. \n\nHowever, due to its popularity and location downtown, you must come here EARLY. By 4:30 or 5pm at the latest, or else you'll spend at least 30 minutes waiting for a spot. It's open seating during HH. The tables with booths require at least 4 people to be able to sit down.\n\nDrink this:\n+ MARGARITAS -- of course! I personally prefer the house margarita because it seems a bit stronger and less sweet. My friend likes the sweeter taste of the strawberry margarita. \n\nEat this:\n+ CHIPS & SALSA -- even better...they're free! I love the freshly heated chips along with the spicy salsas. They pair perfectly with the margaritas.\n+ BAJA FISH TACO -- this is a hefty taco, which makes it a great snack when you're slightly hungry. The tilapia was flaky but I wish the batter was more crispy. I enjoyed the citrusy slaw and salsa verde on top. \n+ QUESADILLAS -- you can't really go wrong with melted cheese between tortillas. I really enjoyed the corn tortillas here.\n\nI've only come here during Happy Hour, but would like to visit again during lunch or dinner time to try out more of their food options.

Probably the best salsa I've had. I have no idea what the sauces are called but its their take on traditional salsa, salsa verde, and this spicy cheesy one. \n\nTheir food is also traditional and uncommon to most Mexican restaurants in the city. Giving you big portion of meat, rice and beans for a $15-20 price average. Although everything was cooked properly, the flavors were to foreign for me to enjoy. Most of the seasoning is more rustic taste then salty and savory that I'm use to. With that said, most people enjoy it. \n\nMargaritas i think are over priced for something that taste like juice and tequila. Although are much cheaper during HH and would be enjoyable with a bowl of chips and salsa. \n\nI do enjoy coming here, its a beautiful restaurant in a perfect location.

Lazy hostesses need to get off their high horse and do their job. Don't let the high number of reviews fool you, they are mostly from the workers in the surrounding area who just come here to eat after work and go. So they don't really care if the experience is good or not. \n\nMy party got our meals after 1 hour of waiting. The surrounding tables who came after us got their meals and had left before we even finished. Not only that, they have a policy during dinners you can only stay 1.5 hours because the place is busy. I had to tell my waiter that I did not want to be kicked out before I finished my food. The waiter did not care that my table was waiting an hour for food, no updates even after asking twice. No sincere apologies or anything to make our time there better. They just kept on insisting we buy extra drinks to pass the time.

There was a small wait for my party of 6, but we got a table in under 10 minutes.  Just enough time to buy some cream puffs while we waited :)  The wait staff was excellent, and my chip basket was never empty.  That's an important feature in a Mexican restaurant IMO.  The drinks were OK, but probably over priced (though it's in the city, so the price was probably standard).  The food though, the food was yummy.  I got the Tres Honcharitos (sp?), a dish with rice, beans and 2 different styles of pork.  All 3 of which were excellent.  The rest of my party also seemed pleased with their dishes, so I'm calling it a huge success!  I'd go back again for sure.", "author": "Corey S."}

The decor has a very rustic feel and there's even a bar!\n\nFree chips and sauce are offered for both lunch and dinner. \n\nFor lunch, Tropisue\u00f1o offers fast-casual dining, where you pay at the counter for your order and seat yourself. My girlfriend, who is a huge fan of Mexican cuisine, thoroughly enjoyed the entree plate with Mole.\nI ordered a Mojado, which is a wet-burrito. For less than $10, it was a HUGE portion of food that I could barely finish. Needless to say, the burrito was delicious and I love the addition of sauce on top. Well worth the price. \n\nFor dinner, Tropisue\u00f1o offers a casual dining experience, with waiters taking your order. The restaurant was quite dark and loud for dinner though. I ordered the Huaraches \"tres Cochinitas\", which had tortillas and 3 kinds of pork. The pork was tender and the whole dish was very filling and flavorful.\n\nI definitely recommend this place for casual dining, as the atmosphere is very clean and comfortable and the food is well-made, authentic, and well-priced.", "author": "Jonathan C."}

It was so bad that I think I will make a detour on my daily morning commute to work, just so I don't have to see this place and remind me of that horrible Friday night.\n\nIf you don't want to read the whole story, here is what I suggest: Don't go here. \nYou might not hit the jackpot and get the same treatment, but why risk it.? You deserve better.\nFew nearby alternatives: \"Garaje\" on 3rd has much better mexican food for much lower prices, \"Zero Zero\" for drinks and pizza, awesome service. \"Marlowe\" if you want a really nice burger. \"Jamber\" if you want beer and wine on tap with good eats. \"Nordstorm Cafe\" if you want a classy place, good services, and good eats.\n\nSo, here is what happened.\nMe and some friends were hanging out around Soma on Friday night and we ended up in Tropisueno for some margaritas and dinner. \n\nWe asked for a table, and was told the wait would be about 45 minutes. So we were debating if we should get some drinks and wait or go somewhere else. After 15 minutes or so, few seats at the bar area opened up. So logically, the 3 of us grab the seats and ordered some drinks. We were getting hungry too, so we ordered some food as well, while we wait for our other friend who is running late since.\n\nAnd that's when things started to get complicated, fast. \nSince there were 3 of us, and 1 friend coming, we have 1 seat thats \"opened\" next to us.  The server came over, cleared the surface of that 1 seat and said, \"no miss, you can't save this seat, this area is first come first serve.\" \n\nWe figured, no biggie, we will just move to the table when it becomes available. We went to the hostess and asked them if our table is available. They then said \"oh, if you had ordered food, then you can't move the the tables. Thats the rule\" \n\n\"But we have another friend coming!\" we said\n\"Sorry\" the manager said\n\nWe went back to the bar, the server came over again and asked us what the manager said. \"The manager said we can't move to the table because we already ordered food\" The server said \" ah , yea, but you can't save this seat, this is first come first serve\"\n\nWe were really stuck. Our food had just arrived, we couldn't switch to a table, and our friend is coming, with the seat next to us possibly taken at anytime. \nOne of our friend asked the server \"What should we do then? Our friend is coming\" Server answered simply  \"Sorry\"\n\nNot having much of an option, we were pissed and started eating hoping no one would take the seat, or we would just finish eating and get out of there. Then our friend send a text saying that he is 5 minutes away. At that time, a couple came over to the bar and asked if anyone is taking the seat. \"yea we have a friend coming\" The server immediately stepped up and push his face really close to  my face and said \"No miss, you can't do that, you can't save the seat\" \nThen gave the 1 seat away to the couple.\n\nAs expected, our friend arrived 3 minutes later, as he arrived, we told him, sorry, your seat were just taken like 3 minutes ago. The couple saw our friend and kindly said \"Oh, you guys can have this seat, no worries\" and moved.\nThen immediately, the server came up again, and said \"No miss, you can't do that. You can't save the seat.\"\n\nI was furious at that point. That man had interrupted our dinner 4 TIMES at that point. I then told him \"No! The couple offered to let our friend have the seat!! She gave it to us!\" Server then said \"oh oh.. ok, it was just that the manager sees this and he won't allow it and I would get into trouble\" \nI then told him \"ok, why don't WE go and talk to your manager together then? where is he?\" Server pointed at the black suit wearing man, the same guy who told us we couldn't move to our table because we had already ordered food.\n\nFurious and frustrated I went up to the manager, with the server quickly followed. I then told him \"So we were the 3 people who ordered food and couldn't get transferred to a table, and now the server here said he would get into trouble since we were trying to save our 4th friend a seat. I just want to let you know that the very nice couple who was assigned the 1 seat at the bar, nicely offered us the 1 seat to our 4th friend is that ok?\" the manager said \"what? I don't know whats happening. yea yea its fine. \"\n\nNeedless to say, we will never to return to this restaurant ever again. This place is always crowded and their food is decent, but neither me or my friends had ever been in a situation where we felt SCREWED at a Friday night drinks and dinner. \n\nThere are better options out there, you can do better.

We waited for about half an hour for a table; the atmosphere was incredibly loud but not boisterous. Music and loud conversations were at times overwhelming.  \n\nWe had tostaditos de carnitas, open-face pork taco appetizers, and they were excellent. Flavorful and weighty, they were worth the trip! As was the house guacamole, which was smooth smooth smooth and had tender bits of identifiable avocado that were still somehow soft as a pillow. The callos a la plancha were delicious (sea scallops with salsa and chorizo-plantain \"hash\") and filling - it was fine as a main dish but it's listed as an app. I stole a carne asada taco from my beloved's huge taco plate, and I in turn benevolently shared the extras on my plate of pollo asado. But not the pollo asado. I'm not THAT kind. This was some delicious chicken. \n\nThe staff members were kind and not pushy, happy to let us linger long after we had paid the check.  \n\nMake sure that if you park at the nearby parking garage, you get your car by 11pm because if you don't, you can't get your car out until the next morning!", "author": "Austin J.

But the fact that I have to stand in one line to order food, and order food where there isn't a visible menu....then stand in a completely different line to get a drink from the world's slowest bartender....who then rushes you to get your ID out before serving you....and is the rude when the other person your party doesn't immediately show up with their ID.\n\n....I haven't even gotten my food yet and this place has already been a huge headache. Wouldn't recommend coming here if you want a smooth dining experience.\n\n[EDIT]\n....and now I've downgraded this to one star (from 3) because the \"manager\" was so rude to me that I've decided to return my food. I'm not about to eat somewhere where the \"manager\" has attitude with me because I didn't get him an ID fast enough.\n\n[EDIT]\nAnd now they are back up to 2 stars because the general manager spoke with me to try to make things right. \n\nHere's the whole story--so I order my food and am directed to the bar to order my drink. Ok. That's fine. It's inconvenient, but not a deal breaker. I order 3 drinks, 1 for me and 2 for my other companions. Well, SFPD are eating right behind me so the bartender is very insistent on getting my ID. Again, this is fine. But he needs ID from my two other friends. This is where things start to get weird. I text my friends to come over with their IDs. While I'm waiting, the bartender tells me 3 more times about how he needs to see their IDs. Yeah buddy, this is fine, I'm not arguing about this, I'm not making a fuss...I'm WAITING for them to come over with their IDs. My husband comes over, takes his ID out....but now the bartender has waved us off saying \"I'm not dealing with this today, I'm not going to serve you.\" Umm...ok?? We sit back down at our table. \n\nAfter dealing with the parking nightmare that is SF, all I wanted was a freaking margarita. So I head back up to the bar to try my luck. This time I order just one margarita for me. I have my ID out and ready. Bartender looks at me and initially decides that fine, he'll help me. I order my margarita....but instead of making my margarita, the bartender proceeds to scold me about how the SFPD are sitting behind me and that's why he has to ID me. Listen....I don't need to be scolded. I never objected to showing my ID. But what's ridiculous is that if it's so important that he checks ID (apparently only when the police are around)--then it should be unacceptable to have me bring the IDs of my two friends up, because I could just grab IDs from any two random people over 21 to get drinks! Thus....it is necessary for the person with the ID to present it themselves. So thus, the attitude that the bartender copped with me not once, but twice, was completely unwarranted. The fact that he refused to serve me for....taking too long to produce an ID (and complaining a little bit about the process...cuz come on, it's inconvenient in that cramped space)...unacceptable. And then the fact that he felt the need to \"educate\" me? I'm being nice by saying he was \"educating\" me on how when the police are present he needs to check ID...but really he was \"mansplaining.\" Well...at that point he refused to serve me again because I became visibly upset over the scolding that I was getting.\n\nAt that point I asked to talk to a manager. He informed me that \"I AM THE MANAGER.\" Wow. Honestly if a place puts someone like that in a management position....I don't even have words.\n\nSo I did the only thing I could think about doing, which was ask for a full refund on my meal and refuse to eat there. Thankfully the person at the register immediately refunded me without scolding me.\n\nKicker is...by the time all of this went down, they had delivered our food. I barely ate it because I was still upset. But what I did eat....meh. Seriously, it wasn't flavorful or exciting. I would rate it at mediocre at best...but even that's a stretch. When you consider the service here, the food is NOT worth it.\n\nThe general manager eventually came over to check out the situation and I explained what happened. He listened intently and even said to me \"[based on what the bartender was saying] I thought I would be dealing with a much more mentally ill person.\" Obviously the general manager (Alex) didn't have a problem talking with me...so I don't know what's wrong with that bartender.", "author": "Sarah C."}

The cause of this is usually because menu descriptions mislead me into thinking that the food is far more appetizing than it actually is. You know this pain! \n\nWhat I can say though, is that there are no regrets here.\n\nThe BF and I called our order in to do take out. Definitely a good choice on our part. Choosing this restaurant was like shooting fish in a barrel; hungry, lazy, and not in the mood to sit down, we chose from a Yelp search for restaurants nearby our hotel and settled on Tropisueno. Who knew that the place would be so poppin?! Thirty minutes after placing our order, we showed up and saw a small crowd outside the restaurant waiting to be seated. Lucky us--I was definitely in no mood to wait after a day of running around the city.\n\nThe hostess was friendly, and brought out our food quick and easy. We ordered: Ceviche de Pescado, Chile Verde, and Crispy Flautas. Our take out order also came with some crispy tortilla chips and yummy salsa. Awesome deal for so much food.\n\nI can't remember what salsas we had now, but I do remember one that had a slightly smoky flavor. This was lighter in color (not exactly red, more orangey), and I thought it would be more mild, but dang this was HOT. So was the ceviche. I definitely enjoyed the ceviche though; at first glance, the serving looked a little small, but it rounded out perfectly. It was light, fresh, and citrusy. Winner!\n\nThe BF ordered the Chile Verde and the Crispy Flautas. The Chile Verde was absolute bursting with flavor, and the portion size was huge.  The pork was mind blowingly tender. The Flautas were a pre-emptive order in case he was still hungry, but he definitely struggled to finish everything. The flatuas were just OK, crispy and good flavor, but also a little dry for my tastes.\n\nA little pricey, but portions are generous and flavor is on par. Take out is an awesome option if you're craving the food but want to circumvent the wait, but I definitely want to try eating in next time, if only to try out the fabulous salsa bar and to sample the margaritas!", "author": "Donna M."}

Other standouts, the trio of salsa's they serve with nachos for dinner.  Also loved the ceviche trio.  The lunch experience is completely different from dinner but still on point.  It's kind of fast-food style, you order what you want, are given a number, and then it's served to you quite quickly.  I had the pork tostada and the meat was so tender and perfect.   They also have a self-service bar of all of their delicious assorted salsas during the lunch service.\n\nThey are a very busy restaurant located next to the Marriott Marquis so peoples' complaints (I see some petty one star reviews on 12/30 about not being able to seat big parties).  They have to deal with the locals as well as tourist crowd.  This is a place where you need to plan in advance - come early, come during off-peak times or make a reservation.  Standard practice at popular restaurants, especially ones with super reasonable prices.  However, even at 9 pm on a Saturday  night, a friend and I were able to snag a table and the host was courteous.

First, the restaurant was hotter than Dantes Inferno. When I asked if there was some way to cool it down I was told the A/C was broken. While waiting for our food I finally went to the ladies room to put my hair up so I could cool down. Meanwhile it was awful to watch the sweat pour down my husband's face. Of course I couldn't tell him anything because it was so loud we couldn't hear each other, and our waiter couldn't hear us either.\n\nWhile the room was hot, the food was not. My beans were a mixture of warm and cold, my Pollo asado taco was flavorless, and the chicken tamale and barbacoa enchilada were nothing to write home about. My husband liked his chicken mole, but it was way too sweet for my taste. \n\nConsidering the vast quantity of great taquerias in San Francisco,  I'd say save your money by going to one of them instead of to Tropisueno. Or maybe to Chevy's.\n\nOh, and they FINALLY opened the door to cool the place off, but by then the night was too far gone. \n\nAfter deciding to give up on the food (mine was lousy, and my husband filled up on the two bowls of chips and salsa they brought to us while we waited...and waited) our waiter finally decided to check back on us. Noticing my half eaten plate he asked how it was. So I told him. He asked if I wanted something else, but since we'd already been at the restaurant for almost an hour I just asked him to pack it up.

We have eaten there for lunch several times and it's always outstanding.  Our first dinner experience, we ordered salmon ceviche to start.  It was amazing.  Dinner comes out, I ordered the tampiqueno (a bunch of beef stuff) and it's delicious.  My gf ordered the salmon, cooked in banana leaves.  After two bites, she realizes her salmon is raw.  And I don't mean undercooked, I mean straight up cold and raw and could probably still swim.  We send it back and our waitress, who I think was the only server on the entire floor, just nodded and took the plate back.  My gf ordered veggie enchiladas and they come out super quick...except its just enchiladas on a mini plate, no rice, no beans no anything.  The waitress comes by again and I ask her if she looked at the salmon and she nodded and said that the owner of the restaurant was told and he was talking to the chefs.  They comped us a desert, strawberry shortcake, which was nice but they didn't tell us and just brought it out.  What, I believe anyway, to be total BS is that there was no mention of any of this.  Our dinner was $100 and the manager and/or owner never came out and apologized or told us they can just comp the meal or whatever.  I thought this was an upscale, fancy place.  Clearly I was wrong.  If this happened at an actual respectable place, you can bet the manager and/or owner would be out they'd be making sure everything was stellar and apologizing profusely.  That didn't happen.  Instead they're okay with accepting the risk that we, or anyone else ordering the fish, could get really sick from FOOD POISONING, SALMONELLA or any other food borne illness from raw fish that isn't sushi grade.\n\nSuper lame.  \n\n\nIn typical SF fashion, the customer is expected to just accept less than what they pay for.

We hadn't packed snacks on the plane and didn't indulge in $12 crackers and hummus, so we were famished. In a daze, we stumbled out of the airport without getting any food court junk and got on the BART. That was when we realized we were in trouble. Dizzy with hunger and plane-ness (you know, that feeling when you get off of a plane--gross, perhaps groggy from a bad nap, and in a different time zone), we survived the zombie ride and my husband immediately steered us toward Tropisueno. He had the pleasure of dining here during his last business visit to the city, and I was thankful he knew about it just because they serve food. \n\nBut they don't just serve any food. They serve DELICIOUS food. We both got entrees with chicken and green sauce. The green sauce was amazing and the whole entree was quite short lived.  I ate more than I expected to and was so happy. The black beans and rice were great sides and the fresh avocado on the side was so creamy  and mouth watering--that's something you earn a great appreciation for in Ohio. Finished with a Coca Cola and the meal was perfect! The service was also fantastic. Everyone was nice and made sure that we were taken care of--I think we looked a little disheveled with our baggage and gaunt, hungry faces. \n\nDefinitely recommended!

We went in, I believe it was around 9:30-10 PM, and there were several open tables. We were sat crunched between another couple and three people at a two-person table. Our waitress and the food had started off pretty good. We were digging it! The people sitting to my right, however, were horrendous. They were speaking very vulgar in Spanish, which my boyfriend and I speak. They were pretty drunk and had brought their maybe 10 year-old daughter who had kicked my leg a few times and put her hands on our table as well. We didn't want to say anything at first because we were really tired from a long day of sightseeing so we ignored it; kids can be tough, we get it. As we got our food, the woman kept getting closer to the point where as I was eating and my elbows kept being tapped by her back and hair several times - without a flinch from her or an \"oops! I didn't realize I was that close to you.\" I thought it was really strange, but then it didn't stop. When I went to get up to go to the restroom I asked her if I could sneak by because there was no room really between the tables, and she didn't even answer me or move! When I came back from the restroom I went in via the other side with the other nice couple sitting and eating. It was so tight I almost knocked over their nacho chips - I apologize profusely having to get that close to their table! Ps- I'm petite at 110 lbs; it's not usually a problem. I also saw the rude table had moved my jacket and purse closer to the other table. A lot of the workers saw what was going on and finally my boyfriend got up and asked a busboy if we could just sit somewhere else to finish our meal (since there was a pretty good availability). He was super sweet and said he was OK with it - looked like he saw everything. I wouldn't normally blame the restaurant for a really rude guest, but some other waiter kept coming by and taking shots with the really rude guests. They were all plastered. When our waitress realized that we had asked to be moved, she all of a sudden became very standoffish with us and borderline rude herself. I thought she was going to be a bit nicer and accommodating, as my boyfriend and I were pretty calm about the whole situation. We told her that we didn't want to say anything to the rude customers and that we just wanted to have a nice night so we asked to moved. It was probably the strangest experience/interaction I have had in a restaurant... I'm still not quite sure why the rude table was being rude nor do I understand the waitress' demeanor to us after the experience we had near the rude table of guests... maybe they were friends with the staff and that's why? We tipped 20% because it wasn't the waitress' fault for the rude customers, but it left a very bad enough taste in our mouthes of the whole place that I wanted to leave this review at the very least. Maybe it's a fluke and it generally is a great spot?! Definitely not our experience though.", "author": "Ms. R."}

The chips and salsa are probably the best I've had anywhere, and I eat a ton of Mexican food. So good!\n\nThis review is about the service, which has been mind-bogglingly terrible every time. I kept going back because the food is really good, but I've finally hit my limit.\n\nOnce: I ordered only soup, while dining with one other person. His food came out promptly, but my soup never came. Various employees came by to ask how the experience was, and each time I asked after my soup, each time to be reassured that it would be out ASAP. My friend was nearly done with his food, so I went up to the cashier for to-go orders and asked after it -- was told the same thing. I went back to my table and waited for so long that I went back up to the cashier, only to be told the same thing. Come on now, you're not concocting it from scratch... just ladle it into a bowl and give it to me! By this point it had been over an hour of just waiting for soup, so I went back to the cashier a third time and asked for my soup money back. He rushed to get a bowl of it from the back but I said no, for pete's sake, just give me my money back. By the time I returned to the table to retrieve my friend someone had arrived with it, but forget it -- my lunch break was over and my desire to eat there had evaporated.\n\nTwo friends and I went there last night, which will be the last time I ever go back. We were shown to the outside seating, and proceeded to wait for 10-20 minutes while at least seven different employees flew by with various items for every table but ours. We got chips and salsa (which we requested refills for several times before ever seeing a menu, it took so long) but did not get silverware until after our food had arrived. When someone came by after our second bowl of chips and asked if we wanted menus, I nearly laughed out loud -- we'd been there nearly half an hour! At this point we had not even met our waitress -- who, when she came, had the affectation of \"this place, the service, I know, right?\" A while later a completely new runner confidently tucked plates in front of each of us, not asking who had what, then said, \"I'll get you silverware\" and never came back. They weren't our dishes at all, but another table's! We sat and stared at this food until we were able to flag down our waitress.\n\nI get this place is crazy busy just about all the time, but their inability to coordinate service while employing what felt like an endless supply of bussers, runners and waitresses, is completely beyond me. The outside seating is first-come, but you must have a system for keeping track of and taking care of your tables! It's glaringly obvious there is little to no staff communication or coordination at all. My boyfriend has worked in fast-paced fine dining for over a decade and if I brought him here he would be disgusted and confused. On that point we are in agreement.", "author": "Vanessa M."}

Everything was full of flavor! The enchiladas in corn sauce I had were amazing, and they modified my order so there would be cheese inside along with the vegetables. It was quite possibly the best Mexican food I've ever had.\n\nToday I made a trip to the city just to experience that greatness again, but learned they have a new chef. The new chef and his crew apparently can't handle simple modifications (like just putting some cheese in the enchilada, not hard). That's not my only issue, though. The food just tasted so much more bland in general. The corn sauce before was so rich and creamy (and there was a lot more of it). I didn't leave a single scrap on my plate, and scooped the remained of the corn sauce up with chips. This time, it barely had any flavor at all. It wasn't thick and creamy, but more of a thin liquidy sauce. There was also a lot less of it. The whole thing was so disappointing I barely ate any of it. I asked my partner how his meal tasted, and while he said it wasn't terrible, it was far from anything special. I wish he could have tried the food while the old chef was there. There was nothing like it! \n\nThe wait staff was very nice and offered to remove my meal from the bill, and even offered to make me something new.

This place was great and the service was phenomenal. All people want from a server is a personable, upbeat attitude, friendly smiles and a genuine concern for your comfort and enjoyment. This place delivered!\n\nMy go-to entree at a Mexican place is usually a burrito or chili relleno; I can tell the authenticity by either of these two things. However, the burritos are only on their lunch menu. So, I went with my Plan B and simply asked the waiter what he'd suggest. Right away he started pointing out the enchiladas with cream sauce. I was sold and decided to try that with the black beans. It was amazing! Definitely had fresh ingredients, fresh sauce and homemade beans -- not something dumped from a can.\n\nI also asked for a margarita of his choosing and he brought me the house margarita...or two. \n\nThis place can get pretty packed -- understandably so -- so when I went, I was shown to a long, narrow table that had others sitting at it, already. I'm from Los Angeles, now living in Reno and I have NEVER seen something like this. I asked the hostess, \"So, you want me to sit right THERE?\" pointing to the only spot that was right across from a couple that were clearly on their first date. I smiled awkwardly before sitting down and waiting to order. This was all new to me, so I almost thought that since the table was so narrow, that we'd share the chips and salsas -- thankfully, I waited and didn't make a fool out of myself by snagging up someone else's chips, even though they were, literally, right under my nose.\n\nI'd have to come back here a second time to determine the consistency of the food/service to give a 5-star, but this place will forever be on my radar when I'm back in town.", "author": "Elaina B."}

Got the tacos quickly - seemed like there was tofu in it, maybe mushy chicken?  Took 25 minutes AFTER my dish came out to get the grilled shrimp. I think they forgot about it. The manager was hanging around our area, so you would think he would have noticed a missing dish.  Asked the manager after 15 minutes of waiting, took another 10 to get it. Only takes a few minutes to grill shrimp.  Right after the plate came out they closed the kitchen.  No apology or anything from the manager. \n\nMost bizarre thing, as  they were getting ready to close the kitchen - they roped off the dining area with people still in the area.  A lot of people were stepping over the rope, which was at least 3 feet high. Accident waiting to happen.  Had to get some silverware and water (all self-service) and went to open the rope, sorry not stepping over, the manager grabbed it and did it for me, not without commenting that I could make it over.

Their chips are so thin and fresh, and the trio of salsas are all unique. Both times I've been here, we polished off one round of chips and salsa so quickly, it's quite embarrassing. I really like all of the salsas, but the warm orange one was very unique.

Had a very pleasant day so far, shopping and walking around the city. We got hungry so decided to go eat somewhere. We're not from Sf so don't know the restaurants very well. We passed by this \"Mexican\" restaurant (Tropisue\u00f1o) it didn't look like what we're used to. Being Mexican ourselves, we might've prejudged, because we have been to places in the city where it's mostly just ambiance and the food ain't that great. We kept looking for somewhere else to eat but we didn't see anything tht looked good near by so we decided to go back to Tropisue\u00f1o and give it a try, we were starving at this point. \nWhen we arrived the host looked at us with a blank stare, we asked for a table for two, he said something along the lines of it was lunch style taqueria hour, don't really remember exactly. But basically we had to go order and seat ourselves. Tht wasn't a problem. We ordered our food, paid $24 for 3 tacos a tamale and an enchilada with rice and beans on the side. It was reasonable not too overpriced for sf prices. As we proceeded to seat ourselves we tried sitting in an area where it was 90% empty, so many tables available. This guy that worked there stepped up to us and started dancing to the music that was playing, waving his hands side to side, I guess trying to say that we couldn't sit there. Didn't say a word, didn't tell us why we couldn't. I don't understand why he couldn't just say sorry this is for reservations only, because that's what we assumed since he couldn't communicate like a normal respectful person. We were getting sketchy vibes from this place already, the staff was just looking at us in a weird way. But we decided to get drinks while we waited for our food, we went up to the bar and my husband asked what kind of beer they served, the bartender answered in a very rude way \"Mexican beer\" with this rude ass look on his face. It was very weird because we seen all the staff being extra friendly to all the Caucasian customers but to us they were very rude and giving us the side eye.

I didn't think it was anything extraordinary, especially being a short BART ride away from the real deal in the Mission. \nTried it again today after remembering I had seen it on Check Please with someone raving about the Mole. \nSo, naturally, I tried the Mole. It was on point and tasted quite good. The meal was huge which was a plus. I liked their salsa bar, which had about 8 salsas. The ones I tried were great.\nI still think this place is good but not necessarily amazing. We came in right before they opened for dinner service and most of the restaurant became roped off from the public. We had just gotten a table before they roped it off so I was climbing over the rope on my trips back to the salsa bar and to get chips, which weren't offered to me until I realized I didn't get any when I sat down. So, I guess the concept is order your own food taqueria style during the day and then table service for dinner. That's fine but it's a liability risk to have people climbing over roped off sections. Just a matter of time before someone trips or falls and sues. \nAside from that my food was definitely good enough to merit a return visit. Also, when they were clearing my table one of the bus boys cheerfully ran up to me and gave me my iPhone, which I had dumbly left on the table. Huge bonus for that. He didn't have to do that, and I've had my iPhone stolen from restaurants in similar situations.

First, you can't beat the location and convenience if you're at Moscone Center for a tradeshow. Second, the manager (James) and his staff are really great to work with. Very attentive, worked with me on every detail (I'm an event planner, so I asked 1000 questions) and on the night of, the staff was so polite and helpful and helped add to the good time. We came up with two \"signature drinks\" the same colors as products we were launching. We did a \"buyout\" for the evening which included open bar and unlimited food for up to 400 people from 5-9pm. The rate I got per person was fantastic for the size of the event and location.  I would say that maybe 100-200 could fit in there at a time, so we had a flow of people through the evening. We moved tables around and set it up for more of a cocktail party, not a sit and serve dinner. They let me put company banners up, branded tent cards and used our company napkins and coasters so our event had a great Branded feel. Everyone ordered at the bar for drinks and could help themselves at the Taco bar all through the night. It is loud and gets a little cramped (bottle neck by the bar into restaurant area).

Apparently they have a great lunch time deal but for dinner, I found Tropisueno totally not worth the price.\n\nI made a reservation for 5:30 as I knew that Happy Hour lasted til 6 and that they had a great outdoor patio. Upon arriving, I was informed that with a reservation I wasn't allowed to sit outside as outside was only for happy hour and happy hour was over. Thankfully I had done my research and so knew better than to let her outsmart me. \"No your happy hour goes for 30 more minutes. Please sit me outside.\" \"Well our last call is in 15 minutes and our reservations are for inside only.\" I'm sorry but what a dumb policy! Walk-ins get the prime outdoor seats while those with reservations are punished for thinking ahead?? And if your website says happy hour goes til 6, don't be cheap and turn people away 30 minutes before that. This totally left a sour taste in my mouth and if I wasn't waiting for someone to meet me here, I would have left right away.\n\nThis isn't to say their indoor seating is bad. It's actually quite charming and has a great ambiance. But on one of the hottest days of the year, outdoors is obviously preferable. Especially when they continued to seat people outside even after 6.  Hostess, you are a house full of lies.\n\nOur waiter was slow, but super friendly and helpful in ensuring we ordered the right drinks and food. Drinks were delicious and he even offered to provide me with more agave since I had mentioned I prefer sweet drinks. Thumbs up for the wait staff!\n\nFood-wise, I've definitely experienced better. Chips were lame and guacamole was unmemorable. My chicken enchiladas were good, but nothing special. For an $80 bill for two people, I expect more.\n\nOverall, fun ambiance, meh overpriced food, and horrible hostess + happy hour policy. I'd be willing to try them for lunch, but would never return for dinner.", "author": "Rachel L."}

While we were told there would be a 45 minute wait for our table (you give your cell number to the host/hostess and they text you when your table is ready), the time went really fast because the weather was excellent and we got to sit outside enjoying some great margaritas.  Also, the service was excellent that evening (2/13/15 dinner service, female waitress - forget her name).  For lunch, the next day, we ordered the chili rellenos again, a carnitas taco and a torta.  Aside from the same comments about the beans and rice, the rest of the meal was delicious.  Lunch is more self service - you wait in line and order, pay, get a number and find a table.

You walk into the restaurant to a menu, place your order, receive a number, take a seat and receive your food promptly. \nSince there was less interaction with the staff, initially I did not think too much of the service as being \"bad\".

The people might be better?, it wasn't.  The food still held its high quality.\n\nDinner was a No-No for me.  First of all the menu is completely different and something I was NOT accustomed to.  I ended up ordering the mahi-mahi and huranches? not too sure but both dishes were very appetizing and pleasing, it was very flavorful, and the pork was practically melt in your melt quality.\n\nThe PROBLEM? the service. \n\nThe Hostess who is suppose to greet people at the door is instead flirting with the customers drinking at the bar. Come on honey, your job is to greet the front door, not trying to get dates with those at the bar.\n\nThe waiters and waitresses seem confused on their tables and never even so much as smile when they serve.  The waitresses in particular are very rude, when I asked a simple question of if I could order, she condescendingly told me to wait for my own waiter, there is a nicer way to talk to people ( you B*$&$).\n\nI would give this place a 2 but when the bill came out, I received the wrong amount of change, it was 10 cents short, but hey if you can short me on that, there is no telling what else you can short me on. what you can't do math, while you stand there and talk to your buddies while I wait for my hard earn money change...no thank you, I won't be returning.\n\nThe food here is amazing, but the service is horrible, retrain or rehire your horrible staff, I will be telling my friends to STAY AWAY.", "author": "Steph Q."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-02-28", "description": "Blink and you'll miss it Mexican restaurant in the Yerba Buena Square area, the next store up from Beard Papa's, and near Press Club. The place does not have it's name on the marquee on top of the restaurant; it's only written on the front window, so just look for the yellow sign on top that says \"Mexican Kitchen\" and that's it. I actually like this place better for drinks than Press Club...although most are tequila-centric, there's a brandy one with egg white (they actually have a whole set of egg white cocktails, which is pretty unique for a Mexican joint) that is pretty tasty. We were running late (parking is a little tough; we got one down near Mission and Third, which is about a 5-7 minute walk to the venue) and couldn't find the place, but the staff was still able to accommodate us and get us our table, which was great. Definitely make reservations in advance; you can't really modify them online once you're about 2 hours out; and when you call their phone number you get a recording to use their website for all reservations, inquiries, etc. You have to keep calling until you get a recording to press \"1\" to speak to a live person for assistance. I tried about three times before getting a hold of someone, so something to look out for (and maybe for the restaurant to improve on...they technically open for dinner around 5:30, but I called slightly before that and had to wait awhile before getting a staff member, although the restaurant is open at that time). The food is quite good; the guacamole can be skipped, as it's kind of bland (it's jazzed up slightly by mixing it with the spicy dip they offer you with the complimentary AYCE chips. You actually get three dipping sauces, each one of varying spice). The ceviche was fresh and I liked the mangoes inside. My main course was the \"old school combo plate\", a chicken tamale and carne asada enchilada. Beef on the enchilada was seasoned well, although I wish you got more of the Mexican rice with it, that rice is boss. The pork tamale my girlfriend got was definitely better than the chicken tamale I ordered. The crab enchilada, the special, was good, just different. Probably wouldn't be in a huge rush to get it again. Beers (Presidente, Modelo, and Pacifico on draft only) will run you $5. The service is a little spotty; I think you can flag down anyone for help, but it's so busy on a Saturday night, you may have to wait a bit. There's a TV at the front with a full bar, and the bathrooms have a really cool matador poster inside...it's possible you will have to wait awhile though; only one toilet per bathroom. Overall, if I'm in the area for Happy Hour, I'd probably make a left turn and hit this place over some of the other establishments in the plaza.", "author": "Dan M."}

TROPISUENO was one of them! Being close to BART was a bonus and it's situated in a cool area right by the Jewish Museum on Yerba Buena Lane.\n\nSO I decided to give it a shot on a First Date and it was a great environment for the situation: FESTIVE, loud (but not in an obnoxious way), and fun. Let's get to the meal:\n\n--DRINKS--\nThere was a running joke throughout the whole night as I asked the waiter for any drink OTHER than a margarita....where he promptly brought us both margaritas....no biggie....the margarita was a margarita....nothing special. If you're into TEQUILA, they have over 80 selections at the bar and decent variety of specialty margaritas.\n\n--APPETIZERS--\nWe went with the GUACAMOLE for $7.50 with jalepeno, tomato, onion, fresh lime, plenty of chips and three types of salsa. This hit the spot, and maybe I was just feeling avocado at the moment, but it was awesome.\n\nThere were a bunch of additional appetizer options: fritos, carnitas, flautas, ceviche, crudo, tamales, tacos, and enchiladas. You're bound to find something that fits your palette. \n\n--ENTREE/MAIN--\nI'll start off by saying portion size (at least for what we got) was huge. We both were not able to completely finish our plates. All entrees are served with traditional Mexican rice, beans, and tortillas.\n\nI chose TAMPIQUENO for $16 - niman ranch beef, thin-cut grilled carne asada, served with beef barbacoa enchilada, and guacamole. The meat was great, I liked getting a small taste of the enchilada on the side, and it was a lot of food to consume. Very hearty and filling plate with lots of flavor.\n\nMy date had the HUARACHES \"TRES COCHINITAS\" for $14 which included three thick tortilla \"sandals\" with three kinds of pork, chile verde, carnitas, and al pastor with pineapple. Obviously, if you're looking for a diverse selection of meats this is a great option.\n\nAnother intriguing option - Camarones Tropisueno: large wild white shrimp, in a creamy chile de arbol sauce finished with tequila, lime, and cilantro.\n\n--DESSERT--\nWe skipped dessert....but not to worry! Our check came with Chupa Chups lollipops.\n\n--CONCLUSION--\nI'll be coming back! Definitely want to try the ceviche. And they have good Happy Hour specials: $2.50 can of Tecate, $5 wells, $2.50 tacos. This place is fun, in a good location, and has great Mexican food. I recommend this place to all!\n\nUntil my next review...HAPPY EATING AND TRAVELING!\n\nTyler", "author": "Tyler J."}

Finally got to try it for Sunday late brunch, and I was happy to see that it was a lot less busy, with indoor seating available (and no wait). It was also a \"seat yourself\" type of situation, which I prefer especially for daytime dining.\n\nFirst, the chips. My friend already prefaced our meal by telling me how much their chips rocked. Can confirm that they are, indeed, very good. Not salty, greasy, or thick... rather, very light and crispy. Almost like a potato chip, except it's made of corn. They also have a salsa/dip bar, with a variety of options. Liked that, though, I have to wonder how sanitary it is with so many people stopping by to use it. Still, it looked to be kept in pretty good condition.\n\nOK, onto the food: we ordered the chicken salad (was 'meh' maybe bc the chicken tasted like it belonged only in a burrito and not a regular salad), nachos (good but the chips didn't hold up so well because they were so thin), and ceviche (not bad, but they should serve it with more than just 2 taco wraps).\n\nI'm told that the empanadas here are really good, but they only serve it at dinnertime... so, I'll have to come back another time to try them... if I dare to brave the dinnertime crowd.", "author": "Diana K."}

The best Mexican I've ever had tend to be in divey hole-in-the-walls, so I was already a little skeptical as I walked in. With a giant menu up front, you walk up to the open kitchen, where you put in an order much in the same way you would at a Chipotle. The difference here is that, after paying, you're given a number, find a seat, and wait as they bring the food out to you. \n\nWhile my friend got an order of their pork enchiladas, I took the advice of fellow Yelpers and got myself a chicken mole poblano for ~$13. Taking a few bites of both, my earlier assumption turned out to be correct - not spectacular, and just another average Mexican joint. Though, I did appreciate the mole for not being overly sweet as most mole dishes seem to end up, but they ran into the issue of oversalting.\n\nAnd while prices are just okay, you do get free chips, portions are large, food is served quickly, and the staff are all pretty nice.", "author": "Johnny W."}

We were staying in Union Square and wanted something within walking distance.  After consulting websites, concierges and everything in between, we decided to go to Macys first so my bf could find shoes.  As I'm sitting there pursuing Yelp for ideas, my bf asks the salesperson if he could recommend any Mexican restaurants.  He said no, but called a colleague over and this guy gave several options, one being Tropisueno. I looked them up on Yelp and saw mixed reviews and thought it was far so by the time we left Macys we just decided to walk on Market and see where we end up. We were starving at this point and after a short stroll I see a sandwich sign out for Tropisueno and figure since it's close and he first thing we see let's check it out!\n\nIt's Friday evening an we got there around 5:30 and several people were eating outside in the cold, which I was not gonna do.  Once we got in we saw several tables open so our chances were good to get a table immediately.  The host asked us if we would be done by 7:30pm since there were reservations and we were totally cool with that.  Let me now say that I am so glad that guy in Macys mentioned it because it was the best gem found in the Financial District!\n\nFirst, they bring out fresh, warm chips and a trio of salsa.  The orange and red salsa was delicious and the chips were sooooo goood!  I was trying not to eat a lot so I could save room for real food.  We ordered the plantains in black bean sauce and it was so divine that I wanted to take it home with me!  I had a spicy mango margarita which was refreshing and a shrimp plate with rice, red cabbage and black beans.  The whole experience was amazing and the food was so good that we went back the next day!  I have never done that with a restaurant, let alone one on a trip so that really means it's good. \n\nWe got there for round 2 at 4pm on Saturday before our flight and was told that they don't serve dinner until 5:30 pm.  I was really craving the plantains again but oh well.  They have an a la carte food line to order from, so we sat at the bar and guess what?  Got more chips, and a wider array of salsa options where it was help yourself!   I tried the strawberry margarita and white sangria and both were tasty.  Now my meal was a chicken quesadilla which was so good that I took half of that sucker home back to LA and had it for lunch the next day!

The times I've been here, it has not disappointed. \n\nAt my recent outing, I suggested this place to meet up with a friend. I wasn't in the city at the time so I called to schedule ahead, as did my friend and we've found that it wasn't possible to schedule an appointment. Not a surprise, the place is just swarming with people. My friend went ahead to get us tables for two, seatings to be available to us at 7pm. I got there late, and apologetic, arriving 25 minutes past the scheduled time. To my surprise, and the servers delight, we were able to be seated the moment I bursted through the door. \n\nCompared to my previous afternoon outings, where you ordered at the register, the night time options had you order from their menu pamphlets. To start, the servers had us with a bowl of chips and 3 sauces for the sides. One sauce was a spicy nacho cheese, salsa verde I believe, and just regular salsa. Before I could even think to ask, they inquired if we wanted guacamole. Absolutely yes. \n\nI was kind of excited to be honest, I wasn't too brave in choosing the options from the board, like a taco or enchilada. I had read a review earlier on one of this dishes, Salmon En Hoja De Platano, which I ended up ordering. Fantastic fish, cooked to medium, had a bite to it that would quickly fall apart in my mouth. To top it off, a big serving as well. An absolute plethora of sides dotted the dishes and I was sure as hell unable to finish it. My friend wasn't into beans, and requested a side of salad if possible. The server told us that they don't have a salad option, but he could try to see if they would whip up something. Fortunately, they were and surprisingly the salad was decent and did not end up being a more garnished shredded cabbage. \n\nThe service is fantastic, speedy, and attentive. There wasn't much we needed, but water was always quickly filled, peoples foods were coming out in a timely manner and the appetizers were fast enough to tide the starving people over. Maybe one niggling issue, our over attentive waiter who would sometimes  break into our conversation just to ask if we needed anything, but we laughed it off.\n\nThe scene is very divey at night, feels casual in the afternoon. That means if you want those nicely lit Instagram photos, you won't get them during the night menu and don't even try. \n\nOverall, a solid choice if you have to get something to eat in SoMa.", "author": "Albert H."}

Because although I'll let you taste the back of my hand* for saying there's no good Mexican in NYC, there are no burritos that I would put in the Mission class. Tropisue\u00f1o might not be in the Mission, but it's a DAMN good alternative near the Yelp office (so close it's been called the \"Yelp Cafeteria\").\n\nBasically, I'll never say no to an al pastor super burrito; it's quick, it's efficient, and it's ever so tasty. The major downside is that eating an entire delicious burrito log will render you useless for the rest of the day. \n\nBut don't even think about eating half and sticking the rest in the fridge.

Not wanting to settle on fast food/hotel restaurant/or delivery. We decided to yelp around! We were sooooo lucky that we stayed only a block around Tropisueno. Opentable had no reservations available so we tried to drop by and see if there were any seats for us. Upon arriving at 8PM, our hostess notified us that there was a 45 mins wait but the bar is first come first serve. We dived right towards the bar and found 2 seats available. Upon seating, the bartender immediately place a bowl of home made chips with 3 types of dips in front of us and handed us the menu. Before I had a chance to even open the menu, I was already stuffing my face with their AH-AMAZING chips and dips already. After munching away half of the bowl and finishing one whole sauce dip, we were finally ready to order - my fiance ordered the skirt steak with pulled pork enchilada with rice, black beans, salsa + avocado and I went with cauldo de marisco which came with a side order of rice.\n\nAfter placing our food order, the bartender paused and asked if we were over 21 lol. We confirmed that we were and were not interested in ordering drinks. He was more than okay with us refusing drinks despite the fact that we were sitting at the bar. Even though he was the bartender, he was extremely attentive in serving us and refilling our water. He even refilled our chips twice and sauces 3 times! I guess he's used to it since their chips are so yummy - other customers must ask for refills all the time! Our entrees were HUGE yet soooo tasty. I'm easily salted out yet the soup was sooo perfectly seasoned and I drank every last drop. My fiance woofed down his entree and couldn't stop raving about it through out. It was the best Mexican food we had together. Wayyyyyyy better than Dos Caminos or Rosa Mexicano here in the city. Even after I finished my entree, I couldn't help but eat more chips and dips as desserts lol. If only we can replace every Dos Caminos and Rosa Mexicano with Tropisueno in the city.

We had about a 45 minute wait, which was fine and accurate. Problem started with the table. It was a booth for 6 not 8 and eventually they stuck some chairs at the end of the table. We asked from some thing different and they started whining they are not really prepared to handle parties this size. So why did they tell us they could?\n  The waitress was not too pleasant not was she very good. We ordered drinks which took about 20 minutes to arrive. We had glasses of water hold the ice. I ordered a club soda which came in a bottle. When it arrived and I opened it it sprayed all over me. I was not too happy. The waitress was like what do you want me to do? The host came over and offered me some warm white dish rag to clean my blue pants up. White cloth...blue pants bad combo and I was pretty angry at that point.\n  As for the food is was ok..not bad but nothing to write home about. I had tacos but they have no corn tacos just soft flower. Kind of weak on my view. Also the chips for the salsa were super thin which I also don't like.\n  The bathrooms really a joke. One men's and one women's room to accommodate 1 person.\n The host did apologize and was nice enough. Maybe for  a smaller party it's ok. But lots of excuses for bad table and bad service. The reality is there is no excuse. Also you would think maybe they would offer a drink or dessert or something. The host did mention that was coming next, yet it never came. But just warm dish rag to clean the mess. \n  All this said. 2 stars is actually being kind. Really one of the worse restaurant experiences I have had in a long time.

For a regular lunch, the portions are generous but there always seems to be a huge line out the door and the restaurant interior is noisy. Seating, especially if you come in a group, is hard to come by. I always feel in the way (even seated!) with the constant comings and goings of patrons and staff.\n\nI also tried ordering catering by phone, but the person who answered said they won't take phone orders or deliver if the total is under $200. So I walked to the restaurant to order in person for later that afternoon, but of course they were in the middle of lunch rush so the staff was running around.

It's the spicy kind of salty which reminds me a lot of my elementary school days where I would buy mexican candy for like 10 cents. \n\nHappy hour is half off margaritas.. sometimes if you are sweet enough the bartenders make your drink a little strong. He always say \"thanks mija\" and give me a wink.. That's when I know... I cannot take heaping gulps. I need to be sipping... But who follow rules anyway. I take my gulps and leave my tab open for the next round. Did I mention there's unlimited chips and three different salsa. \n\nI have not tried the food here yet, but I am very tempted to.

You order off the menu board and the food is brought to you as opposed to sit-down service during the dinner. The menu for lunch is well priced with few options over $10. Its like much better version of Cafe Rio. A large self-serve salsa bar with a variety of dips and toppings is there to satisfy any pallet. I had the Tropisue\u00f1o torta sandwich with features four different meats along and it did not disappoint. The carne asada was delicious and the chorizo was full of flavor, I'd definitely get it again.\n\nI want to try the chile relleno burrito next time as I've heard great things about it. The restaurant itself is well appointed and service was great. No complaints at all means this spot gets a rare 5 star review!", "author": "Justin G."}

MIND BLOWN!), but this place was close to our hotel and looked pretty decent.\n\nIt was busy at the dinner hour, but we were still able to get a table for 2 right away. Definitely pretty dark in here - I think someone said something, because it got noticeably lighter about halfway through our meal.\n\nI got the Tampiqueno, which is essentially their carne asada. I wouldn't call it \"thin sliced\" as it says on the menu, but it was still tender and well seasoned. They give you two HUGE pieces of it, and I didn't come close to finishing. \n\nThe beef barbacoa enchilada was awesome...I kind of wish that I had just gotten a plate full of those, just to make eating a little easier than having to constantly saw through thick pieces of carne asada.\n\nService was attentive throughout our meal. I was nervous at first that I'd constantly be waiting for my water to be replenished (glasses are small-ish), but thankfully the waiter came by with a jar of water to leave on our table.\n\nJust a note if you need to split the check - tell the server at the beginning of the meal. We told him as he was taking our entree plates away, and he said that it was too late. After a pause on our end, he said he'd see what he could do, and then came back with split checks. You think they'd be a little more prepared to split checks given that this is next to an enormous hotel full of business travelers. At any rate, save yourself some trouble and tell your waiter at the beginning.\n\nAlso, huge list of tequilas, if you're into that sort of thing.", "author": "Aubrey S."}

It has sort of a Mediterranean feel to it, but almost Havana-like, which I guess would be Casablanca-esque. \n\nAnyway, a part from the actual set-up, and why I rated this place only 3 stars (mind you this is for the decor only), is because my husband and I arrived on a Saturday around 4:00pm for some Michelada drinks, and we almost walked out after 30 minutes since our drinks had not arrived ye to our table. We sat at the communal table near the bar. We saw the 2 bartenders pouring drinks for others, so we couldn't figure out what the delay was.\n\nThe waiter was nice enough to bring us chips and their 3 salsa platter the minute we sat down, but it was not substantial time for us to wait there for 30 minutes before our drinks arrived at our table. \n\nThe verdict? The Micheladas were so salty that I think my blood pressure spiked after the visit. I will come again to try the food and sit in one of the booths, but I sure will NOT dish out any mullah on the subpar drinks (0 stars for the drinks).

And the interior of Tropisueno reminds me of a beach side taqueria on the Sea of Cortez. I actually love it inside (they have a bar too) because it looks so nice, but maybe that's because the people around here look so much better than they do south of 5th street... oh well divergent much, but yes, the lunch combos come with a huge serving of beans and rice and some tomatoes, avocado, and cabbage. Normal Mexican places have good food too, you say? Perhaps, but I would argue that it is not quite this good. And you know what the best part is? Its the...\n\nSALSAS!!! Some of the best that I've had in any Mexican restaurant, seriously. There are about 9-12 different kinds from tomato based to chili blends, from mild to pretty darn spicy, as well as an assortment of limes, cilantro, and the like.

I am usually skeptical of Mexican food outside of the mission, but my expectations were by far exceeded here. Tropisue\u00f1o is a beautiful Mexican place that manages to combine affordability, decent ambiance, and very good food. Good rice and beans. Meat is tasty and of good quality.\n\nWhat makes this place worth the trip is the fantastic salsa. There is a large range that fits every spice tolerance/desire. Beyond that, the flavors of the salsas are complex and don't just rely on spice to give it kick. Every salsa (of which there are many) has subtle flavor and isy complimented, but not overpowered by the spicy elements. The orange mole is particularly awesome. \n\nBeyond the typical Mexican offerings, this place does great burritos, surprisingly good salads, and fantastic combos for when you're super hungry.

Instead of dull and semi flavored food, theirs are amazingly specific, sharp, and powerful taste. \n\nTheir main dish portions are humungous. Best to just share a plate for two, unless you're hungry.Price is moderate ranging from $10-20\n\nService was FANTASTIC! Their smile always looked sincere even when we were being a little difficult. \n\nSecond Day Visit = Bad\nSome days, the food is good but not as good as some other days, and this day was just above average. We got a FML server and had a temper tantrum when I found a white strand of hair that I pulled out from my mouth from my tamale. (For the record, I have natural pure black hair and have not gotten a white hair on my young head yet) The server says, \"Sorry, (nice try) we don't have any women working in the back. (So it's not my problem)\" Then walks away. Well, that was a bit rude.\n\nLater, a manager checked up on our \"hairy\" dish. I said the same thing to him as I had said to the server. The manager apologizes and said that every once a week they have volunteers to cook for them.They didn't charge me for the tamale in which I appreciate. But the server from there on started to ignore me and talked to only my boyfriend. \"How was YOUR dish, sir?\", \"anything else I can get for YOU?\"; giving him eye contact only and not me.

After visiting SF last weekend with my family, we decided to go to this little restaurant that was moments away from our hotel.  It had excellent reviews and a short wait, but it was a Mexican food joint.  I was skeptical.\n\nGoing in, you can immediately see that the interior is really neat!  The place is dimly lit and has an almost Inca-like atmosphere as the furniture and decor holds many art pieces of that culture.  \n\nI decided to go classic and try the Chicken with Mole Poblano (that was my first time).  My family ordered a shrimp ceviche, tacos, and a flauta.  My chicken with mole poblano was amazing!  I've never tried such a thing, and don't let the \"mexican chocolate\" deceive you!  It's not sweet at all...in fact, the chocolate has a bitter taste that blends unbelievably well with the rich, savory taste of the chicken.  I loved my dish so much!  The tacos and flauta were really good as the meat inside was marinated extremely well, and the ceviche was great too!  The shrimps were very fresh, and the taste of the ceviche was simple but had great flavor!\n\nService here was very helpful and friendly as our waiter explained to us each dish and his favorites.

Upon arrival we were seated at the bar. We ordered a first round of drinks to kick off the celebration, soon after we ordered food and began to have a great time laughing and participating in the self promoted lively experience of the restaurant. After 30mins, I asked to order another round of drinks for the table, at which time I was told we had been \" cut off.\" We were shocked and quite confused as to why we were cut off after ONE drink.\n\nI asked to speak with a manager, at which time I was directed to a man that had been standing by our table for the last 20 mins, which now heightened my discomfort. The manager, summoned 4 other men ( including the bartender) to also be included in this conversation that I thought was going to be between him and I- I suppose my 5'0 petite frame intimidated him.  I asked the manager why my friends and I had been cut off, he replied by saying  \" it is our policy to cut people off after a point.\" Confused, I said, well is one drink that point- because that is all we have had. He then proceeded to tell me, he will no longer serve us alcohol because one person in our party appeared drunk and he no longer wanted to serve us alcohol.  I asked, so an entire group of people are cut off because of your perception of one person?  He again repeated the standard lines above, \" it is our policy to cut people off after a point.\" \n\nAt no point during our time at this restaurant was anyone in our party less than appropriate for the setting of the restaurant, and therefore the cause for the \"cut off\" was clearly motivated by something else.  \n\nOur treatment was motivated by the fact that a group of young Black professionals were sitting in the restaurant laughing and interacting in a way that is outside of the white cultural norm of San Fransisco. Those interactions made the manager feel uncomfortable- and in a white hegemonic place like San Fransisco anything outside of white norms is decidedly not acceptable. \n\nWe proceeded to pay our bill and leave the restaurant, it was clear, by the policing of our table and our behavior that we were not wanted. This Mexican restaurant that was being managed by a white man predominantly serving white people has created an atmosphere build on white norms and white comfortably and does not make room for norms outside of the status quo- and quite honestly has no problem dehumanizing and creating a frightening and uncomfortable atmosphere for people outside of their decided upon norms.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "This is one of my favorite HAPPY HOUR spots in the FiDi!! Though be warned, if the weather is crappy, the area in which you have to be happy is relatively small as Happy Hour prices are only available at the bar and patio. My suggestion: get there early or send someone to save some spots!! Happy Hour is from M-F, 4-6\n\nTHE GOOD:\nThey have 3 sauces available for consumption along with their never ending supply of chips. Each of the sauces has a different spice level (as expected) but the stand out sauce for me is a slightly creamy, spicy red sauce. i have no idea what they put into it but I like to mix the creamy one with the regular and I am in heaven. Can eat those damn addictive chips all night. Did I mention they never end??\n\nHappy Hour food prices are also totally worth it. You can get tacos, guac, ceviche,  quesadillas and more for under $5. I will vouch for all the items on the happy hour menu :D\n\nThe staff has always been super friendly and accommodating even when we had groups of 12+ hanging out for happy hour. The food comes out quickly and the restaurant is always very clean and inviting.\n\nTHE SUPER GOOD (if drinking):\n1) If you have 6 people drinking at the bar together the 6th person, or host, gets drinks all night for free!! (Ask/tell the bartender) \n\n2) The Violet Margarita is my most favorite drink in the city. It has violet liquor (never even heard of this before here) and vanilla salt on the rim... yes, vanilla, freaking salt. It's a little sweet from the vanilla with the tang of the tequila plus a slight floral under tone of the violet. It's a brilliantly balanced concoction. Plus, it's purple!!\n\nTHE NOT SO GOOD:\nI have only eaten a sit down dinner here twice, even though I have been to the restaurant dozens upon dozens of times.  It has probably been over 2 years so read this with that in mind. I don't confess to remember all the specifics of the meals. What I do remember is that the beans and rice were pretty bland. Overall I would be open to giving them another try for dinner.", "author": "Dana V."}

Then we waited and waited and waited for more than 10 minutes in which I tried to get the waitress's attention- and then finally flagged down a busboy to get the bill.

Don't make reservations for a table unless you are okay with them running out of the dishes you want and then giving you a lecture when you don't order enough. Here's a thought: Don't run out of 3+ dishes and then don't say anything to customers who can't find anything other than one more thing off the menu. And don't arrive 10 minutes early and want to be seated in an almost empty dining section. I've spent hundreds of dollars drinking in their bar - you better believe I'm never going back. And neither should you. \n\nI should also mention that last time I was there they ran out of the beer that was on happy hour so I was forced to order a full priced drink. Now that I think about it, it was probably not a coincidence. \n\nGo over to the Press Club. I had a much better time and they didn't run out of Empanadas.

The moletes came out with out the black beans or pickled cabbage garnish but the food runner took them back and brought the correct dish in less than 5 minutes. However, when The entr\u00e9e plate came out and was also wrong, I kid you not, it took 25 minutes to toss a tamale on a plate with two enchiladas. No one apologized for messing up the order, our waitress was stretched so thin she never really checked on us, and the manager honestly seemed to be a bit useless. If you have a waitress who has from my count more than 12 tables to care for on a Friday night you need to roll up your darn sleeves and jump in to help her. Bus tables, take drink orders, run drinks, check on tables who have complained because their food took over 30 minutes, do something other than awkwardly walking around the outside area. to finish off our dinner we sat outside waiting for 25 minutes to pay our bill I eventully got so irritated I went inside to pay. \nwe come here for lunch quite often and dinner occasionally, hopefully tonight was just an off for the restaurant.", "author": "Ranesha M."}

This place was pretty close by to where we were doing some shopping, and we decided to give it a try.\n\nI'm definitely glad we did! I liked that lunch was very casual (you order at a counter and food is brought to you). We just made a quick stop at the bar to order house margaritas before choosing a table outside to enjoy the beautiful, warm weather.\n\nThe margarita was fantastic. It definitely packed a punch but was still flavorful. As a bonus, they used some sort of rimming salt that had some extra spices in it. \n\nI had the regular pollo asada quesadilla (ordered it \"super,\" meaning with sour cream and guacamole). My friend ordered a (HUGE) burrito. For my dish, the portion was also quite generous and everything came out hot. Everything on the quesadilla tasted very fresh and had tons of flavor. Even at an off-peak time (3 or 4pm) this place was pretty busy; I'm not surprised by this given how delicious the food was! I would definitely go back next time I'm in the area.", "author": "Brandon F."}

After enjoying a great meal of enchiladas and margaritas, we came to find out that my sister's purse had been stolen. Now mind you, we were at the bar and she had used the hook right below her. After double checking everywhere around us, we alerted our waiter and he immediately reacted. We had the feeling that every staff member in the place was on high alert for her purse. The staff was quick to check the lost and found, with no luck. The management also responded and tried to place who could have been there last. We ended up parting ways so we could file the police report, but they made sure we were taken care of and kindly comped our meal. \nSo, I would like to thank our awesome waiter (I'm so sorry for not remembering your name!!) for the great service and excellent tequila recommendations along with the rest of the staff for handling the situation as professionally as possible. There are good people in the world, thanks for restoring our faith in humanity :)", "author": "Nicole M."}

We came here and the tiny bar area was packed! We squeezed our tooshies up to the bar to order and we were greeted with some super friendly bar tenders. I got the house margarita. It has the WOW factor I'm looking for in a drink. A margarita on the rocks rimmed with salt and chili powder, say what!!?? That's unique.\n\nI heard the salsa was amazing so I had the bar tender hook me up with some. Another WOW factor item! You get three different salsas with your chips: orange, green and red. at first I really liked the orange salsa and I wanted to love it based on all the reviews but then the more I ate, the more I disliked the sunflower-ish flavor. However, the green, avocado salsa saved the day with it's special pizazz. The chips were warm and fresh too.\n\nThe thing that made me give this place 5 stars is their finishing touch. When they bring you your bill you get a Mexican lollipop. And I mean the good ones. Not the generic ones that your cousin gets for their kids pinata. I think the brand is Chupa.

I can die happy now. Okay, maybe not happy, per se. I mean, I don't wanna get off on the wrong foot and sign my own death wish, but I'm happy that I got to have some rendition of the dish before I move along to whatever Jesus Cristo, or whomever's in charge of all that reassignment jazz, has in store for me. \n\nAs soon as our server warned of the pozole being the spiciest dish on their menu I was ripe with excitement. As a (Chicago Suburban) renowned hot-head, it's hard to make a dish too spicy for this senorita. After finishing off the ultra deep bowl, I'd rate this a sold 3 out of 5 chili peppers. For me, this dish hardly registered on the calliente scale but maybe for regular gringos it's something that heeds a warning. Still a delicious dish, despite not quite living up to my heat-seeking infrared taste buds.\n\nThe guac appetizer was a good, nothing I'd label as being too terribly memorable but I solid standard appetizer when doing Mex. Overall, I'd say I probably enjoyed the complimentary salsas the most- and that has nothing to do with the fact that they're complimentary. They're just damn good! With the options of orange, red, and green - and yes, I know they probably have real and more descriptive names, but I didn't ask and after my Santo (St. Germaine Margarita) it probably wouldn't have stuck either. My fave was the orange because - and this is gonna sound REAL weird - it kind of reminded me of how tuna casserole tastes (as far as I can remember). And I love a good home cooked tuna (or any other home-made version of) casserole. Had I not been present with a classy date (wink wink, JZ), I likely would have drank it straight from it's tiny, white, porcelain trough. \n\nAs far as going back is concerned, I wouldn't rule it out. Even though it appears as though I already conquered their only vegetarian entree on the menu, I'd be down to chug a few more troughs of that orange salsa before I head back to the Chi 'Burbs.", "author": "Candice G."}

Let me elaborate.\n\nThe first trip was with my coworkers, who definitely enjoyed their food.  I would have enjoyed mine, except they put the sauce/sour cream on my 1 fish and 1 shrimp tacos, after I asked them to be on the side.  Normally I'd just ask nicely for them to swap them out, however my tacos came 20 minutes after my coworkers' food arrived (we ordered at the same time), and I just wouldn't have time to wait another 20 minutes.  The manager was apologetic and gave me coupons for 2 free tacos.\n\nI decided to come back for the tacos, as I was confident that my experience was not a normal one, and that their tacos will taste even better if I can control the amount of sauce and sour cream.  Upon ordering the tacos to go (I ordered 4 again, so I paid for 2 and used the coupons for the other 2), the manager was angry at the waiter for taking my order, instead of attending to people waiting to be seated.  I mentioned that I was also a customer, even if I'm not dining in, and he said another waitress will take my order.  The waitress eventually took my order, but my tacos came out almost 30 minutes later, which shouldn't take that long.\n\nI really wanted to like Tropisueno and recommend folks to stop by here, however twice in two days I had uneven service.

I made the reservation weeks in advance. Bestie and I walk in and check in, they do not seat incomplete parties so we waited at the bar. We ordered margaritas while we waited, my bestie has high standards and always asks for top shelf..drinks were really just all ice, completely watered down and cost me $35! Should have just opted for a house marg, small glass maybe would have done the trick! ;-) Disappointed there. Once our other 2 girls came we checked back in and were seated within a couple minutes, cute little table in the corner. We had the guacamole and empanadas to start. Guacamole was pretty boring and bland and a very small portion. Empanadas were tasty, nothing too spectacular though.

And this review is for a weekend lunch, where you have to order at the counter. I wasn't expecting that.\n\nSo for lunch, they make everything ahead of time (for example, enchiladas) and MICROWAVE IT. That is an incredibly sucky way to do business, people of Tropisueno. The absolute worst way. My cheese enchilada was hard, unmelted cheese. I talked to them about it and they were kind enough to bring a replacement enchilada, which was exactly the same. Cheese still in hard, grated form, not melted at all. Putting a sauce on it doesn't help. Side of guacamole was astringent and inedible. Terrible guac, probably from a Cisco tub.\n\nWe will never darken their door again.\n\nHave to weigh in about the bathroom.

We had the house margs, and I loved the salt chili rim. Chili was a nice touch. Margs are good and $9! They offered chips and salsa. The habanero salsa was served slightly warm and what a great touch! Spicy but not fire. Well, we like spicy so...beware if you are a beginner.  The smoky tomato was the DEAL and tomatillo had a slight zesty kick that made it also very delightful.\n\nI had the 3 pork tacos meal. Holy Guacamole. Smack yo mama good.  The refried beans were flavorful and I just tasted the rice...standard fare and not eventful. Did I mention the tacos were stupid good? My hubs got the veggie enchiladas and almost licked the plate.

When the plate of food arrived, he moaned, \"What is wrong with you people?\" I guess it's true that Americans over eat. Portion control? WTH is that? USA! USA! If you leave hungry at Tropisue\u00f1o, something is very VERY wrong with you. \n\nYou won't leave hungry. But, I don't know that you'll leave satisfied. Everyone always makes mention that the BEST Mexican food is in CA. I'm sorry to say that I haven't found it. Chicago may not be in CA (I know a little geography) but we've got it covered when it comes to slammin' Mexican cuisine whether some shorty is making burritos, a dona is making huaraches or Ric Bayless is making the definitive everything that is Mexican (I'm still not so comfortable with that statement). Point is, we've got good Mexican eats in Chicago. So, if I am going to travel mucho miles to eat Mexican food, I expect it to turn me out. Along those lines, the food here is an over-the-jeans squeeze.*\n\nChief amongst my complaints: the guac is really bland. No bueno. I get that the place gets slammed and they need to keep the line moving, but put a little love in your heart and some lime & salt in your guac! The burritos are shockingly large, full of meat, beans & cheese and you'll labor to get through one but, in my experience, it's not memorable. I've eaten here a few times (circumstance) and each time, I am stuffed full but not very satisfied.

Not terrible in my book, but it's all what you're used to. The highlights were the chips and salsa, margaritas, and the service. \n\nThe Chips and Dip (BUENO) - It's tough to go wrong with chips and dip. At Tropisueno, they bring you three kinds of salsa and are generous about refilling both the chips and the dip. \n\nMargaritas (BUENO) - The choices were pretty unique (ie - spicy mango margarita), the drinks were decently strong, and each drink came with a different salted rim. The little details make all the difference. \n\nService (BUENO) - When we asked the waiter to make our guacamole extra spicy, he not only upped the heat, he also brought us a habanero salsa that was several notches hotter than the three salsas they typically provide. We were BIG fans of the habanero salsa.\n\nBeef Cheeks Taco (NO BUENO) - There was nothing wrong with the way this dish was cooked. I just didn't like how it tasted and couldn't take more than one bite. Who knew you could go wrong with a fatty cut of beef. \n\nMole Chicken (NO BUENO)- When I think about good Mexican food, I think fresh ingredients and bursts of flavor from jalapeno, lime, and herbs. This dish was none of that. True, the plate looked beautiful and the chicken itself was tender. However, flabby chicken skin is a big no-no. There is a cardinal rule that if chicken includes skin, the skin should be crispy (ie - fried chicken). Otherwise, don't serve it. If I could have removed the skin, I wouldn't be making a big deal. However, it was so thoroughly smothered in mole sauce that it was impossible to figure out what was what without barbarically digging around with my fingers. In the end, I had to suck it up and eat it, flabby skin and all, along with my tasteless rice and less than memorable refried beans.   \n\nOverall, I would come back for happy hour margaritas and chips with dip (especially the habanero salsa), but I'd head to dinner elsewhere.", "author": "Cindy T."}

I get it that it is a Sunday night and you make your money off alcoholic beverages, but some of us don't want to drink, thank you. One of the members of our group was not feeling too well and asked for a glass of warm water and the guy just went on to lambast us about how he cannot serve anything warm to us - they don't have a microwave in the kitchen, they only serve cold beverages. He then caveated it by saying \"I don't want to be rude!\" Then what did you want to be? \n\nWhen it came time to order the main course, one of us wanted to know what a caldo (it was on the menu) was - I know, noob question if you eat mexican food a lot, but we don't - the guy just did the biggest eye-roll I have seen in my history of eating out.

Our group of 3, later to be joined by a 4th, walked in a little after 4:30pm on a Sunday. We were told to order at the counter and seat ourselves, because waiter service didn't start until dinner (no time mentioned). After we ordered, but while we were waiting for our food to arrive, a rope was placed around the tables. One by one our dishes began to arrive, the last making it's way to the able around 5pm.  A woman approached us at 5:15 and told us we needed to finish up and move in 10 minutes, because reservations were coming in at 5:30. Apparently, on a Sunday in the business district the place was booked solid. The chips and guacamole were good but my chicken quesadilla was greasy and many of the chicken pieces were too fatty to enjoy. We were visiting from Philadelphia and chose to meet our San Fran friends here to catch up. Rather than have the opportunity to drink margaritas, eat food, and talk, we were rushed out of the place.

This place is out of this world when it comes to great food at very good prices. As a vegan, it can be really difficult to find delicious food at most restaurants. But with Tropisueno, they even have a selection of vegan dishes. \n\nWe stopped by after an afternoon of hopping around to a couple of museums. As I sat outside the Museum of Modern Art Store, I looked over to see a really nice place that had a lot of happy faces sitting at the tables. Since it was early afternoon, we showed up when the place is set up like a regular tacqueria. You order your food at the counter after reviewing the menu just inside the front door. After you pay for your meai, you find a place to sit down and wait for your order. \n\nAs I waited for our food, we were given fresh made tortilla chips that are absolutely the best I've had in a very long time. They were crispy and delicious, perfect for dipping into a salsa. And since they have a nice big salsa bar with a variety of tastes and temperatures, I was able to find one that was just right for me. \n\nI'm sorry I don't have any pictures, but we were so hungry and I just had to dig in and start eating right away. It was so good that I could only sigh with delight. It helps that we had a table that looked out over the pedestrian mall outside the restaurant. We could enjoy the view and the food!\n\nIf you want a good meal with great atmosphere at an affordable price, the Tropisueno is a great place to go! I can't wait to go back and try something else (and take pictures of my meal!)", "author": "Corey G."}

We also got an order of guacamole and when I tried it it was very spicy. I asked my waiter if they could be made mild instead and he said no the guacamole was pre-made. I then asked again when it was time for our entrees and he finally said he would ask the kitchen. They made me a side order of guacamole without the jalape\u00f1os, which I did appreciate, but that should have been offered from the beginning and I was still charged for the extra guacamole.\n\nWhen the tacos arrived, my dish had the beans and hers didn't. Then, I tried the chicken tinga tacos and they were beyond spicy. My sister has a good spice tolerance and she even thought they were really spicy. I ended up just wasting that taco.

Mexican food, arguably, is my favorite ethnic cuisine. Since I moved up to the Bay Area, it's been difficult finding a decent Mexcian food joint in the city. After many failed attempts, I finally discovered Tropisueno... and I'm SO stoked I did!\n\nATMOSPHERE: Dim with nice decor. To be honest, the decor seemed a little on the girly side. In my opinion, the best way to describe the decor is \"whimsical\" - playful and quaint. But it wasn't over-the-top. The atmosphere sets the place up to be a great date spot. \n\nSERVICE: I made reservations for two at 7:45pm this past Sunday through Open Table. We were seated right away when we arrived. Our server (forgot his name) was really cool. He gave good recommendations and was on top of everything. \n\nFOOD: This is a bold statement but I probably had the best chips and salsa experience ever at Tropisueno. Right when you sit down, they bring over a bowl of tortilla chips and three different kinds of salsa. I couldn't really tell what two of them were but there was a red, green (most likely salsa verde) and orange one. The orange one was bomb. When I first tried it, it really took me by surprise because it was a warm salsa - really good. The green one was delicious as well. I didn't really care for the red one but it wasn't that bad. I ordered the Carne Asada Plate (Tampiqueo) which came with rice, beans and a beef barbacoa enchilada. The Carne Asada was cooked perfectly - tender, juicy, flavorful. Man, that shit was delicious! Everything else on the plate was good but they took a backseat to the amazing steak. I highly recommend the carne asada plate!\n\nPRICE: I was shocked when the tab came. My buddy got two bears and an enchilada entree plate. I ordered two margaritas and the carne asada plate. Our bill came out to $58.55 before tip. I thought that was very reasonable, especially since my steak was BOMB. \n\nI highly recommend making reservations if you plan on having dinner here.", "author": "Bruce C."}

The combo plates and everything I've ever tried is simply delicious. Speaking of lines, their salsa bar usually has one since people usually load up. So many different varieties and all very tasty.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable as well. For $10-$15, you will not leave hungry. Pick a menu item, tell the service folks what you want, get a number and take it to your table. Load up on some chips and salsa (careful not to overdo it, although I always do), and then the service brings out the food. Definitely keep your receipt because sometimes they mess up.

So rate this 2 1/2.\n\nI had a 5:30 reservation and even after a slow stroll and window shopping from Opera House got there 5. No problem, figured I'd have one of the famous margaritas at the bar. Some restaurant bars are extension of dining room; same customers waiting for tables or maybe eating at bar. This was, simply, a bar. A lot of youngish guys who knew one another and bartender by name. I was the only woman. And way older. I looked and felt very out of place. They asked if I wanted margarita, I said yes. I later saw a strawberry version I would have preferred had I been told it was an option. Kept eyes down, sipped drink, halfway through they finally offered me the chips. They were very good, thin & crisp, liked salsa. I ate the whole bowl, probably a mistake to fill up but I had consumed half a margarita on empty stomach...\n\n5:30 arrived, got table. Restaurant so dark I needed my flashlight to read menu. I got salad, thought of Mole Poblano but I sometimes make that so opted for the pork 3 ways as I'm less likely to cook that. Should have stuck with first choice. Salad good, had greens, seeds, jicama, something sweet (mango? could not tell since it was literally too dark to see my food). Asked for aqua fresca, told unavailable although it was on menu so just drank water. When pork arrived, I could see white squiggles, about all I could see in darkness, and knew them for crema. Not only do I dislike crema in itself, I think it mutes and ruins flavor of food. Had I known meat came with crema I'd have asked them to hold it; this may have been in fine print on menu but it was too dark for fine print even with flashlight. With no visual cues, I could not tell which pork was which. Corn pillows, however, very good. Crisp edges, soft interior, good corn flavor. Black beans, which waiter recommended, bland.\n\nWhile I was eating salad another party sat at next table. Tables were so close together when the waiter stood between them to take their order, his ass was literally in my face, and he was not fat. I guess funny in a way but when I'm eating I do NOT want some dude's ass in my face! They need to train staff to stand behind diners, not between tables. \n\nWaiter recommended tres leches cake but I was feeling really unwell. Not just over full but out of sorts. I had an article I wanted to finish so had been reading by flashlight during dinner. I told him to give me a few minutes, hoping I'd feel better, instead room began tilting back and forth. I asked for check, which was promptly brought, paid, stuffed everything in my purse anyhow and got up dragging coat and gloves. When I stood room began to slowly revolve. I made it out the door, barely. Fortunately they have outdoor tables and after sitting in cold about 10 minutes stabilized and was able to get to BART. This was in NO WAY the fault of the restaurant, I want to stress. Reading by flashlight is not a steady light and that plus the alcohol threw my system out of whack for a short time. But still, combine the uncomfortable feeling at the bar, the inability to see my food, the crema which I really dislike, ass in my face, not having an item which is on the menu, and dizzy spell, it was just not a great time.

But, out of all the places that I have tried, Tropisueno is one that I have come back to on more than one occasion.  Granted, it is the more fancier side of Mexican, but it is a place that I rather enjoy.\n\nCame here last night for my bestie's birthday.  I did not have a reservation.  But, upon telling the hostess that it was the BFF's birthday, she immediately got us a table.  Amazing service.  I was very pleased with all the staff last night. A+ guys!!!  And they brought her out an amazing Tres Leche cake for dessert.  I had a mini-bite.  Very sweet and tasty.  She loved it - as it was obviously from her complete devouring of it...\n\nWe weren't very hungry, however, deciding to spend the night sipping on some margaritas and munching on snacks, but it was still very good.  I love the trio of salsas that are presented here.  So amazing.  I scarfed on them.  And ordered more...\n\nMargaritas were strong and good.  Though, I hate to say, I have had better.  But, they were still pretty good.\n\nThe ceviche sampler is amazing.  One of the fish is a bit too fishy.  But, it was still a very good ceviche.  I would recommend it.\n\nAnd...unfortunately...that is all we had.  I would go back.  I mean, I have.  I continually have.  And...to add another plus to it, the restaurant is located right across the way from the Metreon.  So you can come here for a bite, head to the movies a little slushy and lushy after.  AWESOME!!!", "author": "Jenn S."}

Something I also noticed is that every one of my servers has been male and the only women I've encountered, have been the hostesses.  \n\nI've tried several things here like the ceviche de pescado (pretty tasty), the tampiqueno (a bit chewy but great flavor), the Pollo Asado (really good but the veggies were way over cooked and I didn't get any mushrooms), and the Huaraches \"Tres Cochinitas\"  which is amazing and will be the only thing I'll order in the future. In addition, the guacamole, chips, and salsa trio are devine and totally worth it if you're yoyo dieting like myself!  \n\nOne complaint, I ordered the house margarhita and ordered it spicy, the first was great but had too much ice, the second I had to send back and the third was just okay.

OK, it wasn't that bad. But I came back from a vacation abroad to rediscover a pleasant surprise in Tropisueno. It was actually the second time I tried the place after nearby Yelp staff was praising it to the heavens when it first opened a few months ago.\n\nA decent Mexican restaurant was desperately needed in the area ever since the Cadillac Bar died a tragic death many years back to make way for the Moscone Center. You can have Chevy's though that tortilla machine is pretty entertaining, and don't get me started on Andale in Westfield where mediocrity is a requirement in that pricey food court. Tropisueno turns out to offer good, fresh Cali-Mexican dishes (...that's the way I would describe them anyway) right on Yerba Buena Lane opposite the big, tilted cube of the Jewish Museum.\n\nWell, first, the mandatory chips are excellent and always fryer-hot - so watch your piggies when devouring them with the two bowls of tasty salsa that come with them (see my photo). The $8 Molotes de Papa y Chorizo make a nice starter - a masa concoction shaped like an empanada that they fill with potato and chorizo and then drizzle with crema and black bean sauce (see my blurry photo).\n\nI've now tried two of their entrees, both solid choices and not overly ambitious on their part. The $14 Tampiqueno is the more intriguing of the two - thinly sliced carne asada that they top with grilled onions which is complemented by an enchilada, rice, a small scoop of fresh guac and fresh uncut scallions. your choice of enchilada (see my photo). I also liked the $13 Traditional Oaxacan Mole Poblano where I went for a chicken leg and thigh that was swimming in a thick sauce filled with dry chiles, spices, nuts, herbs and chocolate. I had wanted to try the $13 Pollo Asado where they marinate the chicken with citrus and achiote, but I was forewarned that it takes 25 minutes to prepare. Maybe I'll be more patient next time...not!\n\nNo pinatas, no bullfighting posters, no mariachi jukeboxes, no senoritas in off-the-shoulder peasant blouses sharing their maracas (ahem). The place has more of a California feel after a day in the Cost Plus furniture area, but it works.

It's a nicer choice to have a group lunch other than Chevy's. I cannot help to compare it to Chevy's, because you get a similar serving of complimentary thin tortilla chips and salsas. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/32lqhWMpq_YpGUbfYg_ZDQ/l The only reason they get a low rating, was because the last time I was here my dinner was disappointing.\n\nWhen I came the place was packed and busy, most of the tables had groups of 6 or 8 people.

Usually not a problem, \"IF\" the food is prepared well.\n\nThe appetizer of mushroom & cheese empanadas topped with guacamole was good. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/I1ZXgKoM0RAVch8qoI1QWQ/l After that I had to wait a very long time - more than 45 minutes. Somehow the waitress forgot to place my order or maybe my entree went to a different table, I really don't know what happened. I realized something was wrong after the staff tried to clear my table thinking that I had already finished my meal. I had to tell them that I was still waiting to get my food order.\n\nMy waitress came back (I guess the bus boy told her) immediately apologized, said that she'd have my plate in 2 minutes and left. I thought to myself, wait a minute how do you cook a steak in 2 minutes? I had a feeling that the meat would probably be overcooked (I imagined an angry cook overwhelmed with orders, burning the meat at high heat to complete the rush order for my plate), and after about 4 or 5 minutes I saw exactly that I was right. The pieces of meat on my plate were mostly burnt (you couldn't see any grill marks). The exact same dish at the next table to my right had better looking meat (not burned) with nice grill marks.\n\nIn my opinion, the wait staff looked tired and flustered from all the people they had to serve that night. For that reason, I didn't feel like making a fuzz or sending the dish back, it would have been a waste of more time too (yeah, I'm a fool for not pointing out their error). I had lost most of my appetite anyways, while waiting and eating tortilla chips. I cut the edges of the meat thinking that the center would be less burned, ate what I could and left the rest. I filled up with the enchilada and beans side dish.\n\nHere's the picture of my \"carbonized\" beef:\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/PwhED8Yw1V3bQJUFtxpLbw/l\n\nSide of beans and tortillas that comes with every entree:\nhttp://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/yBr7XJu4-IkKjwRhekpN3w/l\n\nThe long wait time and the burned meat = wasting my time and my money, should merit only one star. But since the place was really busy and the waitress seemed to be trying hard to please all her customers, I'm giving them a 2nd star. I might visit them again in the future, MAYBE. If that results in a better experience, I'll revise my review and rating then.\n\n*********************************\nNote: I've corresponded with one the owners.

We asked our waitress if we could have the table, since we had outgrown the smaller booth, and she went to check with the host.  The host told us we couldn't have the bigger table because it was already accounted for, and that typically the restaurant does not take reservations for groups larger than 4.  We went with it, but then he seated two people at the massive table.  It just seemed logical to us that we should take the larger table, having 8 people and give the 4 person booth we were squeezing into to the couple.

Being from Texas, I was skeptical but we found Tropisuno nearby and decided to give it a try. Short answer is that I was blown away.\n\nWe arrived at 5pm on Sunday night and they had just started some kind of transition where I guess they were changing out the kitchen staff or something, but they said they wouldn't start seating people or serving food until 5:30. We weren't pressed for time so we just went to the bar and ordered a couple of margaritas. They do not serve any kind of frozen drinks here, including frozen margaritas, which is fine with me but it caught a few of the other patrons off guard. I ordered the top shelf margarita with cointreau and my wife got the house margarita. I ended up ordering a house margarita myself because it was absolutely the best house margarita I have ever had, and remember that I live in Texas. The bartender, Alejandro, was phenomenal and we ended up just staying at the bar to eat instead of swapping to a table at 5:30. Alejandro had us try a tequila that was made in Austin, TX and also showed us some infused tequila that they were making. \n\nThe chips and salsa are fantastic. There are three different salsas (traditional salsa, verde, and a spicy habanero one) and each one was very good. I think my favorite was the verde, but my wife claimed all three were the best salsas that she had ever had.

Anyway, once you find it, its all uphill from there! We went seated promptly and our host/waiter greeted us jovially with the chips and salsa. There were 3 kinds of dips for the chips: Salsa, green salsa and a chipotle-type dip. ALL of them were amazing! Especially the chipotle-type dip. Mmmm..\n\nOur waiter/host said we should order a margarita because they use 'quality tequila'. So we did. And MAN that was quality tequila because this drink was STRONG! \n\nI ordered the mole chicken and my date ordered the seafood stew. My mole chicken was out of this WORLD. Believe me when I say this, because I am not usually a fan of Mexican food, but at Tropisueno, I was SOLD! My date's seafood stew was great too, but my mole chicken - YUM! And the portions were SO generous! My dish was only $15, and I could only eat half of it! The rest of it, I took home and clung on to for dear life so I could save it for lunch the next day. \n\nThe restaurant was pretty, the service was GREAT, food was DELICIOUS and pricing was just right.

The wait wasn't bad at all on a Saturday night -- around 20~30 mins for a party of 2.\n\nWe started with their house margaritas. They actually rimmed the glass with a special blend of salt -- more flavorful than regular table salt that other places use. Yum yum!!\n\nI had their sea scallops appetizer as my meal, and it was amazing! The scallops were rich and creamy, well spiced, and paired well with the chorizo. I was surprised a Mexican place can deal with such a delicate seafood item so well -- I usually only see shrimps and fish done well in a Mexican-style dish.\n\nThe mister got the chicken mol\u00e9 and was really impressed with how tender the chicken was. The mol\u00e9 was pretty good too, not the best we've had but certainly not shabby.\n\nTheir complimentary chips and salsa are another crowd pleaser. Chips are similar style to Chevy's (thin), but with a richer corn taste, and they serve it with 3 kinds of salsa, one for every tastebud out there ;)\n\nOverall I am very impressed. I usually like to go to taquerias or taco trucks but once in a while it's nice to have a sit-down Mexican place to chill at. Especially one that makes good drinks.", "author": "Alice C."}

Thought we can grab a bite to eat and some cerveza before we head out. As you walk in, the rustic wood finishing and the colorful lights and palm trees teleports you into another place where time passes slowly. Having traveled to Mexico a few times in the past, this truly feels like an authentic Mexican restaurant!\n\nThere was something pleasantly peculiar with our nachos that we shared. We noticed that the carne asada had a bit of a sweetness to it...almost like brown sugar. It was different, unexpected, but still delicious. We wanted to eat more just to figure out exactly what it was.\n\nMinus one and a half stars for attentiveness. In case you don't know, Tropisueno is a restaurant where you order your food at the register, sit down with a number, and they bring your food to you. After your food is served, there was a great lack of service. No one was checking in on us (or anyone for that matter) to make sure everything was okay. We needed more napkins and most importantly, utensils. After a few minutes, I had to get up and get them myself from their waiter station. I know doing so breaks an etiquette rule, but I couldn't wait any longer. \n\nOverall, this place is really cool.

Yes.\n\nAfter almost three years of setting meetings here over $5 Margs with hab sauce & chips, the four of us -- all regulars and neighbors of the bar -- ran into a young man, the Host, who saw himself plush with more regard for himself than necessary. Because a young four set inquires about the happy hour and dinner at the same time, does not mean we don't want dinner, it means we want both. A fair question. So we all decided we'd like to sit and have dinner without the happy hour deals. But the Host didn't like our decision: \"Let me see if I can find you a table.\" Cue the camera to pan across the empty dining room. Host turns away from us, seats other people. Forgets about us. Roger that. Not coming back. \n\nRarely, if ever, do I write a review based on an experience like this, or in particular about a specific staff member.

Unfortunately we had a terrible time here.  I have loved coming here for lunches and this was our first time trying dinner.  We were very impressed with how they change over the facility for dinner, quite neat!  From the moment our waiter met us, he either hated us, or hates working there.  Joselito stepped on my wife's foot when he first came up to our table and it went downhill from there.  We had to request a water for our child after he only brought some for us.  He left before we could finish telling him what kind of beans we wanted (there are 3 choices).  Our appetizers came over 10 minutes after our entres despite us specifically asking for them first (which is going above and beyond what you should have to do anyways) as one was our kids meal.  We had to flag him down to get tortillas that were supposed to come with our entrees and he only brought a couple.  We had to ask if he was bringing our guacamole appetizer and he brought it right out then.  A separate issue, but pretty sure he brought us just a side of guacamole as it was a tiny 1/2 cup scoop in a bowl.  If that's really $8, that's another issue!  He genuinely disliked us or perhaps he should no longer be part of the front of house staff.  That being said, everyone else we encountered was excellent.  The people next to us had Omar as their waiter.  He was a normal great waiter like you encounter all over SF but seemed like the best in the whole city compared to our experience with Joselito.  There is only one other time in my whole life I have left less than a 20% tip, it was that terrible.  My family has worked hard just to survive living in the city as non-techies and we can only afford 1-2 meals out a week.  I suppose we won't need to return to Tropisueno anymore. Sad.

This used to be our favorite spot in downtown with great ambiance, friendly and attentive service and great margaritas. My past few visits were terrible. I went there last night with couple of my friends. I had to wait for 25 minutes for a bartender to notice me at the bar. That didn't mean I was helped. I went to the other side of the bar only to hear from bartender \"There is no need to stand here, I'll be with you when I have time\". I didn't have a chair, so when a woman next to me closed her tab and left, I didn't hesitate to take her sit. Same bartender immediately told me that I couldn't take that sit since it belongs to a different area and called someone to take it away! Seriously?! People were sitting there just fine and I couldn't? I understand there are certain rules, I manage a bar myself in Marina and I know no matter how busy you are a smile and good attitude make a big difference. Being rude like that without saying a single nice word is absolutely inexcusable. Another time I had dinner there with my friend I only ordered an appetizer while my friend had a full dinner. I apologized to our server for not being very hungry and told him I'd make up for it with drinks. He got so pissed of, he literally told us we need to hurry up because other people were waiting for a table. And took my margarita from me half full! \nI guess their policy is to pay little attention to service since their location will keep them busy no matter what, but I really wish they could improve their attitude a little bit.", "author": "Olga S."}

I add the fancy caveat because if I personally wanted Mexican, I would find myself in the Mission, but Tropisueno will definitely fill the void in the financial district.

I stumbled across a raving Joi B review and since Tropisueno is literally in the same building as the Marriott Marquis I decided to give it a shot.\n\nA Yelp truth, if Joi B says a place is really good, it is really good!\n\nFor lunch, this is a Mission style burrito place and it is really good.  $10 for a huge burrito with fresh ingredients and great service.  For lunch, this is a 4* place.\n\nSadly, I went back for dinner a few nights later and if I understand correctly, the dinner service is managed by a completely different set of people.  The waiter told me that the \"lunch kitchen\" is locked and that he could not obtain any ingredients that were utilized during lunch.  The dinner was ok, kind of pricey and the service was slow.  I had the Carne Asada type dish and it cost about $25.  \n\nIn summary, I would not go back for dinner but I would definitely go back for lunch.", "author": "Lance W."}

We walked in the door and asked for a table for 3, and were immediately greeted with \"well it's going to be at least an hour\". No hi, no hello, nothing. So we asked if it'd be okay to grab drinks from the bar while we wait, and he replied with \"well if you want to try, but the bar's small and it's full right now\".\n\nThe rest of the exchange was even worse- the host snapped at us, skirted around answering fairly simple questions, and at one point interrupted my friend's question to chastise her for speaking when he wasn't done yet (while still not answering any questions). I've done food service, I get that employees get frazzled, but this wasn't just a stressed out employee. This guy was a complete jerk. \n\nAnd that point, I was tempted to say screw it and walk out. But the recommendations we'd gotten were so glowing, and honestly we were so hungry after travelling all day, that we decided to stick it out. I'm glad we did. Everything else was fabulous.\n\nWe got a margarita at the bar while we waited- despite the bar being very busy, the bartender was fast, friendly, and mixed a wonderful margarita. Ultimately, our wait ended up only being 30 minutes or so, totally reasonable given how busy they were. I got the chili verde, which was fantastic and a huge portion. My friends got a vegetarian dish and another pork dish, and both seemed to like them. The fresh guacamole was great, as was the second margarita ;) The vegetarian options on the menu weren't super obvious, but there are a few.\n\nThankfully, the rest of the staff here was great. Bartender was so friendly and quick, the waiter was extremely nice and explained all the options to my friend who was a vegetarian.\n\nUltimately, I'm glad we got past the awful host and stayed here, because we had a great time. But if I hadn't been so determined to stay there, I probably would have walked out and left an awful review- it's sad how one person can really ruin a place, especially when they're the person who is supposed to greet people.\n\nSuggestions to the owners: Train your hosts to actually greet people. If possible, try to put more than one stall per bathroom (there was quite a line). Mark the vegetarian options on the menu to make it a bit easier to choose. Then this place would be perfect ;)", "author": "Amanda B."}

Most people seemed to agree that it had the best damn chips and salsa in the city. Boy were they right! \n\nThe first time I came here it was during lunch hours, which make seating and ordering more casual. You order at the counter and sit where you choose and they bring your order out. I settled on the chile relleno platter. While waiting for my entree, I had a tremendous amount of chips and salsa. The chipotle and salsa verde are to die for. Both are very flavorful and give you that extra kick you crave when chomping on tortilla chips. The chips were fried to perfection and were bottomless.\n\nWhen my order came, it was drizzled in the appropriate amount of cheese and sauce. The ingredients were fresh and everything has an amazing amount of flavor. This was definitely the best chile relleno outside of my grandma's cooking I have had.\n\nThe second time I went here was with the boyfriend to show him how amazing the food was. He loves chile rellenos as well, but decided on the beef stuffed one, which both of us agreed was amazing. Our server was attentive and kind and we got flour tortillas with our entrees! \n\nIf you are in the city, visiting Yerba Buena or are in the downtown area, YOU MUST GO EAT HERE.

Our waiter took the chips away as he brought our food... which sounds like a potentially bad thing, but it was actually thoughtful. He said, \"Now that you have your food, you'll want to concentrate on that.\" Which is true -- you get a very substantial meal here, and it's delicious, so why fill up on chips if you're here for a main event? \n\nMargaritas are wonderful. They taste really fresh -- the house has an almost herbaceous edge -- and they serve them on the rocks. I tried the house and the watermelon. The house was great but I think I give the edge to the watermelon. No pitchers.\n\nTo the entrees... I loved my chili verde -- gone in a flash. Lots of tangy flavors, slightly spicy, and the meat was super tender. The accompanying rice provided a nice vehicle for absorbing some of the extra sauce. Perfecto! My friend loved her salmon -- which our sharp waiter recommended. And her husband had something with beef (sorry... can't remember what! Bad Yelper!) and he thought it was good -- wasn't raving over it, but was happy. Three types of beans -- refried, pinto, and black -- showed up at our table. I thought they were all grand, and the refried beans weren't greasy. Also really enjoyed the fresh, hot tortillas... though with the rice and beans, I honestly just had one, only to try it.  \n\nAnd I notice they like to keep the beverages movin' here. Even though they put a bottle of water on your table, the waiters and servers come by frequently to make sure your glass stays full. I really appreciated that. And the margaritas: Dang. We'd pretty much finish off a glass and it was like they had installed radars in the bottom of those glasses, designed to go off at the moment of Margarita Completion. Our waiter would come right by and be all \"Can I get you another?\" as if we were hanging out in his home and he was just being a gracious host. :) You're almost ready to say yes because they're so good... and the tequila wears your defenses down... so be ready to say no! Once you're in Margarita Town (TM) it's easy to be all, \"Yeah, bring it on!\" and forget that (a) there's tequila in them thar drinks and (b) you are, in fact, paying for them...\n\nGiven the proximity to all sorts of hotels and businesses, it draws a crowd. So, DO get reservations because even on a weeknight it gets busy. And if you're the first to arrive and your friends are on their way... still check in with the person at the front. They won't seat you until your entire party's there, but at least they probably won't give your table away.\n\nLong story short: You'll enjoy your food and beverages. Convenient to BART, hotels, and lotsa offices. Have fun!", "author": "Tami S."}

It's a little pricier than the taquerias in The Mission, but if I was downtown this is probably my go to place if I want Mexican food. It gets very busy for lunch so call in your order if you plan on picking it up. I recommend the shrimp burrito. It's pretty big, but it feels me up for the rest of the day.

Boyfriend and I wanted to have dinner out last Friday and realized it had been a long time since we had Mexican food. Since it was a weekend date night, I wanted to go somewhere with a decent atmosphere (don't get me wrong, I love taquerias, however, for a Friday night I wanted to go somewhere we could sit at for awhile, have drinks, etc). Also, due to the crazy storm we just had this past weekend, I didn't really want to drive too far for food. Hence, after a little Yelping, seeing great reviews, and remembering having passed by Tropisueno, a dinner destination was chosen.\n\nWe went to Tropisueno on Friday night for our 7:30pm reservation and the place was packed! The only issue I had with this was that it was really loud/noisy, tables seemed to be extra tight next to each other, and it was hot hot hot inside. Other than that, everything was wonderful.\n\nAfter you sit down, the server/busser brings you chips with three different salsas - green, red, and orange (varying spicy levels) and also asks if you would like Guacamole. If they ask you, say YES! From the get go, I was blown away by their chips, salsa, and Guacamole - every single one of them was fresh and so delicious. (Keep the sauces and guac for your main dishes - yum yum yum!)\n\nThe cocktails here are also great. They have a menu of different types of Margaritas, a  menu of Tequila cocktails, wine, beer, etc. I had two of their cocktails - I don't remember the names but the first one was their Margarita with cucumber puree, second one had ginger and honey in it. Both tasted of quality ingredients, tasted great, and were strong! Definitely some great, stiff drinks = me like!\n\nThe true test of the restaurant - the food. Boyfriend got the Los Favoritos, which is the traditional combo plate. He got two items - grilled chicken Enchiladas and cheese Tamal. I ordered the Chile Verde. We also got Empanadas on the side. All of the food was absolutely delicious. I love that not only is the food here so tasty, you can tell they use quality ingredients. The sides here are great too - rice, and regardless if you order Refried or Black Beans, they're all tasty. The high note for me was definitely the tortillas/carbs (?) they use here - tortilla that came with my Chile Verde, Tamal & Enchilada tortillas, and chips are all some of the best I've tasted. \n\nOverall, I loved Tropisueno! Very satisfying find. Great food, drinks, atmosphere, and service, all at a very reasonable price.", "author": "Tiffany K."}

The portions are large enough to satisfy any gurgling tummy-chasm, so head over with an appetite. \n\nDuring lunchtime they transform it into a taqueria situation. Get in line, pick your lunch bomb from the giant menu (nearsighted people rejoice!!), and make your way down the assembly line to the cashier. Don't forget to appreciate the people bustling like crazy making your meal, these folks work like mad, and still manage to make your meal attractively prepared. If you avoid the lunch stampede hours between 12pm and 1pm, you can usually snag a nice table either inside the restaurant or in their outdoor seating area. Make sure to pay a visit to their well stocked salsa bar. I truly appreciate the presence of limes and hot sauce. \n\nFor dinner I would recommend making a reservation. The taqueria shuts down to make way for a more comprehensive menu rife with delectable choices, and walking in to try and get a table can be difficult. \n\nHappy hour is great, there's some small plate menu options, plus their margaritas are tasty business. I will stop the gushing to insert a tiny gripe - the happy hour drink prices do not extend beyond the bar. If you find yourself at a table during happy hour, prepare to pay full price even if you are getting food. Sadly, the bar is nearly always packed during happy hour -- so shoot a few jealous glances at the lucky bar-bodies and hope for better luck next time. \n\nOh!

It wasn't the worst, but it could have been better.  And (3) The ladies room on my second visit (didn't use it the first time) would have really benefited from some tidying.  Whenever I see a dirty restroom, I always think of what I read once in an Anthony Bourdain book.  He advises to never eat in a restaurant with a dirty bathroom.  Why?  He says the restroom is the part of the restaurant that the customers see.  If they're not willing to keep that clean, imagine what the kitchen (which you *don't* see) must look like.

Initially they were amazing, but the problem was they heated them to a point where they were perfect when they came out but quickly cooled. By the time I ate the tamale it was about room temperature. Wished it was heated a little bit more. That being said the food tasted great and I plan on returning next time I am in the area.

Then I worked on the other side of Yerba Buena Gardens for a year and a half and Tropisue\u00f1o was shortlisted as a go-to cure for a  ridiculously long workday. Now that it's been a while, indeed I occasionally still have tropical dreams about the one too many tequila/chips'n'salsa-induced headaches I developed here. Ah, what fond, fond memories. Qu\u00e9 buenos recuerdos.\n\nBut what is Tropisue\u00f1o, exactly (and what is it not)? The answer: a lot of things. It's a taqueria, but it's not a hole-in-the-wall. It's commercial, but it's not a chain. It's a nice restaurant, but it's not expensive. It's a bar (yay), but it's family-oriented. Basically, Tropisue\u00f1o is an independently-owned version of Chevy's (which it faces some fierce competition against, down and around the block). As such it appropriately serves up more authenticity and ambiance. And the margaritas? They may not be as ginormous or colorful as you'll find at the franchise counterpart, but they are tastier and pack quite a punch. Highly recommended, especially if you can get there before 6 (when happy hour ends).\n\nDecent prices, enjoyable atmosphere, great location (nestled between Market St. and Yerba Buena Gardens, in the same plaza as the Jewish Contemporary Museum) and did I mention that it IS a bar? IN FACT, if you bring five friends, your drinks are on the house!! (\u00bf\u00bfEn serio?? That's what the website says: http://www.tropisueno.com).

It's like Chipotle on steroids (they have seafood) and not in a good way.   \n\nYou start off by getting in line, ordering from the lady behind the glass and then you watch them make enchiladas in the microwave.  We were a party of three, so we tried a variety of items: a carne asada burrito, a tamale & carne asada taco combo plate, and the cheese enchilada plate.  I didn't stand by to watch them put together our entire order but I did notice the following: 1. Corn tortillas for tacos were not warmed up on the spot, they had been previously warmed and wrapped in foil ready for the next customer - me.  2. Four more previously warmed corn tortillas are taken out, cheese is spread, and plopped into the microwave - BOOM, now you have enchis.  3. I've had better carne asada.  \n\nI wont return but I'll give this place two stars for a killer salsa bar and its ambience.", "author": "Cynthia V."}

Mind you, this is after we had ONE drink, so we clearly were not. Furthermore, how could the actions of one person end with the decision to cut off an entire group of people?\n\nTo me, this was simply a case of people being uncomfortable with a group of education, black professionals out enjoying themselves with one another. At no point were we bothering any other patrons. At no point were we belligerent. And at no point were we even asked to keep it down. And mind you, this was IN A BAR!\n\nAfter speaking with the manager, he told us that we could continue to have drinks, but that one person in the group couldn't. Really?

I could have made a meal out of this alone! I ordered the Tropisueno Margarita which was smooth and creative made with ginger and lemon for a fresh and unique take on a classic drink. \n\nThe dishes that followed were all stunning. The ceviche was so fresh and chunky and had the perfect amount of citrus zing to it. I practically drink the sauce at the end! I found, however, that it was better to eat the ceviche with the light and delicious tortilla chips rather than the harder, less flavorful shell that they serve it with.  The friend plantains (one of my all-time favorite side dishes) were sooo well done: the perfect texture, not too mushy, and the most perfect balance of sweet and salty.  I almost ordered it again for dessert! The two al pastor tacos were also perfectly crafted, with rich tender meat, flavorful corn tortillas, and a burst of sweet pineapple thrown in. The empanadas were yummy and the dough was especially so - it was, withe the guacamole topper, the star component that really made the empanadas truly special.\n\nThis is definitely one of the best Mexican restaurants I've eaten at outside of LA and Austin, but again, I didn't actually order any of the entrees.  I think we did the smarter thing by trying a variety of dishes off their incredible appetizer menu.\n\nAlso, I would have liked to see a more robust dessert menu.

There were three salsas: a super spicy tomato-based salsa (I have a really, really high tolerance for heat  -- this salsa was HOT, but super good), a tomatillo salsa (which was equally as good, but not as hot), and some sort of spicy queso, which, again, was really good.  The little trays the salsas came in weren't very big (one of the minor reasons I didn't give 5 stars), but the server was happy to supply us with more.\n\nI ordered the house margarita ($8, I believe), and it was absolutely delicious.  It had spicy salt on the rim, and was housed in a huge glass (not your average small margarita glass).  I was pleasantly surprised.  I also had a strawberry margarita, which was really sweet (try it, if you're into that).\n\nFor our main course I got the street-style tacos (can't remember the actual name), which were also really good, but I was kind of surprised when my plate showed up with only two tacos on it (another reason I didn't give 5 stars).

While it kills me to wait an hour when there are such amazing restaurants in SF, the convenient location near Powell and reasonably priced menu made it worth the wait. \n\nAlthough I love all the authentic hole-in-the-wall Mexican food in S.F., it was really nice to go to a sit down restaurant with this cuisine. Tables are served chips and three different types of salsas, each better than the last. We ordered guacamole for the table, but it wasn't anything special.\n\nThe Margaritas have way too much ice in them. For an $11 drink I expect more than 5 sips.\n\nAll the entrees were tasty, but not the best Mexican food I've had before. The Salmon filet was a standout, as well as the Chicken with Mole Poblano. \n\nI would still honestly come back because the ambiance is great and it is extremely convenient.

The meat was well seasoned but nothing amazing. The tortilla was really hard and not steamed properly. I'm thinking this isn't a normal thing for them -- I probably caught them at a bad time.

I was meeting my partner there for dinner who works for Westfeild. The hostess took my name and told me she would have a table for us in 5 minutes as there were several being cleared then put my name into a list on the computer. I looked over and saw several small tables being cleared...after standing less than 5 feet away from her for a while in the small reception area next to the bathrooms. When my BF came in and greeted me with hug...She began to seat parties of two ahead of us that just walked in and asked for a table for two?... WTF? I was standing right next to her...Was she high? Drunk? Forgot to take her medication ? Who knows? \n\nI'm a pretty patient guy, not pushy or demanding.. I'm a clean cut professional and so is my partner.  I've worked in the restaurant business for years...I know your pain.\nAt this point i thought it might be an oversight on her part. clearly, I was confused as to why she didn't seat us and was seating parties of two ahead of us...\n\nAfter several parties of two walked in after us who asked for a table for two  and were seated by her  right away, I asked her what was going on and if there was a list we were on and why she didn't seat us at a table? She acted like she was miffed,then told me I mis understood her, then said it was a miscommunication.  Then I asked her how long it would be to be seated? Then she told me she might be able to seat us in maybe 20 to 25 minutes!  This was after she told me\" 5 minutes and that tables were being cleared\".  Keep in mind that I had been right in front of her the whole time, and at this point t we'd been waiting for about 15 minutes and we were the only customers waiting in the small reception besides her...\n\nThis is when it became creepy. she stared right at us  with a manic- F-you grin on her face.

It is very affordable given the quality and quantity of food, which makes it great for college students, dates, groups (someone in a group will inevitably be broke), and this dried up queen who tends to find something to snarl at.  Luckily there was no snarling here last night!   I'm a San Francisco local who has his fair share of amazing Mexican food and is a general food snob, but I really like this place!  I live close by, and I am definitely adding it to my list of places in the neighborhood to frequent.    \n\nFor vegetarians who grumble that most Mexican restaurants don't have many vegetarian items, I have found one here!  I wasn't feeling too well, and I've also been trying to eat healthier, so I got the Pozole Vegetariano (vegetable soup with a tomato broth).  It was very flavorful and filled with vegetables.  I'd definitely get this again.  \n\nI've had the less vegetarian-friendly Tampique\u00f1o, which comes with an enchilada.  It is a ridiculous amount of food!  I recommend both.  If you're not into the insane about of carbs that Mexican food typically involves, the tampique\u00f1o is good choice because it basically like a steak.  And without getting overly descriptive, all I have to say about the enchilada is that they're really good and you should probably get one.\n\nAh yes, last time I also had the empanadas.  I expected them to be all deep-fried and overly crispy (aka, prepared hours ago and reheated prior to being served), but they are super fresh here.  To all people who skip the first round:  don't skip it here.  They have great starters here that you shouldn't miss.  Plus, it gives you an excuse to have another margarita without looking like you have a drinking problem!  \n\nSince my first visit months and months ago, THE SERVICE HAS IMPROVED BY 200%!    \n\nThe server was very attentive about making sure that I never had an empty margarita glass, and the entrees didn't come out until after the very yummy Molotes de Elote y Chorizo were finished.  I think it is also helpful that the margarita glasses are significantly larger now.  \n\nI give a lot of respect to the owners of Tropisue\u00f1o for reading Yelp reviews and responding to disgruntled patrons.  I was NOT happy with the service the first time that I came here.  As a result of their openness for improvement, then coming back to see dramatic improvement, it shows that they really care about their patrons, and I will definitely frequent this place more often!", "author": "Derek B."}

Once we finally made it to the restaurant after wandering the neighborhood we were seated quickly as there wasn't a wait.  The chips and salsa (4 kinds) were brought quickly. Chips were hot and cripsy and the salsas were great! Great flavor and kick. The salsas gave us high hopes for the entrees.  The guacamole was okay. It needed more lime and salt.The house margarita was good, but not really worth $8 based on the size and taste.\n\nWe were hoping for a great meal based on the taste of the salsa. We ordered the following:\n\n1) 2 Chicken flauta and cheese enchilada combo plates\n2) Chicken enchiladas combo plate\n3) Carne Asada dish\n\nThe waiter and kitchen messed up the order and only put in 1 order of the flauta and enchilada so I was left waiting for 15 minutes while the plate was made so were didn't even get to enjoy our meal together. There was an apology but no other show for their error. \n\nHere's a review of the food:\nThe flautas were good. The enchiladas (Cheese and chicken) were not up to par because the sauce was not good. If you are looking for a flavorful sauce, this is not it. It tasted and looked like tomato sauce out of a can with a little something added as an attempt at flavor. Also, there wasn't enough sauce to cover the enchiladas so the tortillas had dried out as well.  I didn't try the carne asada but according to my cousin the spices and flavor were good but it was dried out, chewy and very hard to cut even with a steak knife.\n\nWe ended the meal with a birthday and not only did they take forever bringing out the dessert they also charged us for the dessert that wasn't even very good.\n\nAll in all,  it was an okay experience. The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the salsa. It was a 2 star experience otherwise. I may go back for happy hour or something but not for the entrees. I've definitely had better.", "author": "Roma N."}

We arrived early and got to choose where to sit in the empty dining room. Ten minutes later, the dining room was packed.  Tables being moved around to seat parties of 10, and people vying for tables and chairs.\n\nLike other reviewers have mentioned, I expected them to make our entrees in front of us as you placed your order. You know, taqueria-style.  No worries though. Our food came out relatively fast: nachos, chicken quesadilla, chicken enchilada. The portions were big. We boxed up half of my daughter's quesadilla and rice/beans from my enchilada plate.\n\nThe crowd was really easy going and fun. We sat on the banquette opposite the windows. I like the pillow (?) dividers that set up \"boundaries\" between you and the next table. The dining room is a bit dark but very relaxing.

My favorite salsa was the orange one.\n\nThe dishes are very reasonable in price for downtown SF.  At about $12-$20 for most entrees, Tropisue\u00f1o will set you back about the same as going to an Anytown, USA Chevy's, and of course the food at Tropisue\u00f1o tastes much fresher than your \"local\" Chevy's (sorry no love for you, C!)\n\nI ordered the Tampique\u00f1o, and I was given a generous slab of steak and portion of rice, beans and tortillas served with a scoop of guac.

My wife writes all the cool stuff\n\nA couple weeks ago we had dinner before going to see Inception.  We were in downtown San Francisco near the Metreon on Yerba Buena Lane and noticed a Mexican restaurant, Tropisueno.  Arriving a few minutes too early for the start of dinner service at 5:30, so we enjoyed a drink at the bar.  The drink menu has a list of specialty Margaritas, which I highly recommend.  Different flavored salts are used to rim the glasses to enhance each Margarita.  I ordered the Violeta, a classic Margarita with a hint of Violet liqueur on the rocks with Vanilla salt.  My husband ordered the Margarita de la Casa, which is a traditional Margarita, but rimmed with Arbol chili salt.  Both Margaritas were well balanced and the flavored salts added a nice dimension to the beverages.  The beverages definitely stand out.\n\nThe dinner menu is fairly large offering an assortment of small seafood dishes and starter dishes, a number of entrees, and more traditional combo plates.  For a starter we ordered the Empanadas de Hongos, small Mexican turnovers filled with mushrooms and cheese.  The crust was tender and a bit flakey and the filling was well seasoned.  Chips and salsa are brought to the table at the start also.  The chips are amazing.  Thin, crispy, and salty.  They don't even need salsa.\n\n\nTropisueno Empanadas and Chips\nAll entrees are served with Mexican rice and a choice of beans.  The rice is lightly seasoned to produce a great flavor to accompany your main dish.  We decided on white beans for our choice.  They were creamy and sweet.  I ordered a combo plate with a vegetarian taco, and tamale, and a cheese chile relleno.  The relleno, a cheese stuffed pepper baked in a corn flour coating was the best item of the three.  Very rich, but you can't go wrong with cheese.  My husband ordered the Tampiqueno, thin cut carne asada served with a beef barbacoa enchilada.  The thin grilled beef was nice and tender and the enchilada was a delicious accompaniment to the dish.\n\n\nTropisueno Chile Relleno and Tamale\n\nTropisueno Tampiqueno\nAll in all we had a good experience and a good meal at Tropisueno.  It would be a fun place to go with a group to celebrate a birthday.  I'll have to go back for lunch, for during the day the restaurant it a taqueria, serving a different menu.", "author": "Chad G."}

The ceviche was really tasty, but the fried fish in my burrito tasted really inedibly fishy. FYI, that \"fishy\" taste or smell is an indicator that what you're eating is far from fresh, and it made me feel slightly nauseous for the rest of the day.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-15", "description": "Just went to Tropisueno for lunch with my co-workers to try their burrito.  My office has continued to rave about this place and how it makes Chipotle seem like fast food (which...it sort of is...) in comparison.  In any case, I had the shrimp burrito with the spinach wrap tortilla.  When it came out, I almost died when I felt how heavy it was.  For $8.50, this was most definitely two meals.  While we waited for our food to be brought out, we were given an unlimited amount of chips, unlimited access to the salsa bar, and refills on waters.  Bear in mind that we had ordered our lunches to go, so it wasn't like we were going to be eating in for lunch.  This place gets kind of crazy and busy during lunch hour, but it's for all the right reasons.  One of my coworkers made the comment that he thought that this was some of the best Mexican food he's had in the city.  For the amount of food you get, plus the freshness of their lunch items makes this place TOTALLY worth it.  Other items that were ordered in our group was the beef quesadilla (which was deemed \"OK, but a burrito would have been better), a barbacoa burrito, and a shrimp burrito with a wheat wrap.  I definitely think that this place is worth trying if you're looking to break away from the monotony of Chipotle.  Note that this place does not do burrito bowls, but has salads available.  Customizing your burrito is also easy as I asked for no beans, cheese, or sour cream in mine.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Soy un fan de Tropisue\u00f1o!\n\nKnowing that there's always a line out-the-door at Tropisue\u00f1o, my friend and I decided to do an early lunch on Friday, 5.7.10. We arrived at 11:30 AM and luckily, there wasn't a line yet.\n\nFOOD/DRINKS:\n*Guacamole: $3.95 - YUMMY!  The guac was nice and buttery with hints from the garlic and chilis to give it a nice kick. However, there were very large chunks of avocados which would break the chip when you tried to scoop it out from the bowl. So, we ended up with pieces of chips inside the bowl.\n\nYes, the homemade chips were good and were served warm, however, they did NOT hold up to the guac as they were very light, thin, and crisp. They were similar to the Chevy chips but less oily and salty.\n\n*Chicken w/ Mole Poblano (dried peppers, nuts, and chocolate): $11.95 - YUMMY! This was the first time I had mole and although I was excited, I had my reservations b/c a \"savory\" chocolate flavor seemed less than appetizing to me. However, I was totally blown away. The chicken (white) was extremely tender and flavorful from soaking up the sauce which was creamy, savory, spicy, nutty, with a very slight bittersweet chocolate aftertaste. \n\n*Chicken w/ Mole Amarillo (dried chilies, red tomatoes, onions, and garlic): $11.95 - Meh! The chicken was dry and tasted more like chicken (used for the burritos?) tossed in pico de gallo. The sauce which was more like a salsa consisted of tomatoes, garlic, onions, and cilantro. It was quite bland and didn't have much to heat to it.  \n\nBoth moles came w/ a side of seasoned rice a choice of red, black, or refried beans, and a salad. \n\nThe rice was nicely seasoned and was cooked al-dente. The red and black beans were tender. They were unseasoned, however, it was topped with cotija cheese which gave it some seasoning. The salad consisted of crisp butter lettuce, 2 slices of red tomatoes, and 3 slices of avocados. \n\n*Pineapple Agua Fresca: $2.95 - It was ok; it was bit too syrupy and sweet for my taste.\n\n*Watermelon Agua Fresca: $2.95 - It was very refreshing and slightly sweet. It was a bit grainy which shows they used real watermelon.\n\nHowever, both Frescas were ROOM TEMP which was disappointing. \n\n*Salsa Bar: There were about 5 different types of salsas from what I recall. \n1. Salsa Verde was watery and was borderline flavorless w/ a very slight kick to it.\n\n2. Pico De Gallo (mild and medium) was fresh and had nice chunks of red tomatoes, onions, garlic, and cilantro, however, it was flavorless. \n\n3. Salsa Ranchera? (orangey color salsa): OMFG, it was SOOO YUMMY! For those who are familiar with the infamous Papalote Salsa which is creamy, garlicky, and packs a kick that will leave your mouth with a fiery aftertaste...this one comes pretty damn close.\n\n4. Salsa Roja was extremely HOT and vinegary. \n\n5. Condiments: Beets, jalapenos, pickled jalapenos with onions and carrots, white onions, and cilantro. \n\nSERVICE:\nThe service is so-so hence minus 1 STAR. We weren't greeted by the ladies who took our order and we waited 10 minutes at the register to pay b/c the cashier was fumbling w/ the register. She then just told us to come back and pay. \n\nIt's Taqueria style during lunch; look at the menu, order, get a number, pay, and they bring your food to your table which takes about 5 minutes or so. However, it's a sit-down restaurant during dinner. \n\nI'm not fond of the Taqueria-style ordering system here b/c it's highly INEFFICIENT during lunchtime. At 11:45 AM, although the dining area was near empty, there was a line of more than 30+ people that stretched far our the doorway which is caused by bottlenecks holding up the line from staring at the menu AND b/c there's only one register. Since they bring your food to you anyways, they might as well make it a \"sit-down\" restaurant during lunch as well.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nI LOVE the ambiance at Tropisue\u00f1o! It reminds me of a hacienda converted into a restaurant; the open kitchen w/ Spanish tiles, the dining area w/ sloping bamboo ceilings, rustic wooden tables, chairs, flooring, and cabinets, and the cabana style booths which adds a sexy romantic touch. \n\nPARKING:\nThere's a garage 1/2 block away on Market and 4th, however Public Transportation is highly recommended as the Powell Street station is just a block away. \n\nIf I'm in the area and craving Mexican food in a rustic environment, I'll definitely come back to Tropisue\u00f1o!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

His exact words were - \"See Miss whatever has happened has happened, we can take this out of your check\" and he left. I was like really, this is how you behave with your customers? I think he was just trying to ignore me may be because this happens often there and he is used to it. I would give 0 stars if possible!! Sometimes I feel it is sin to be a vegetarian.", "author": "Deepali A."}

Maybe I had just built up the idea of the margarita in my mind?  They were fine, but nothing I'd write home about.  My boyfriend got the sangria which he liked, but I didn't.  Had too much of a coca cola flavor to it for me.  \n\nI had a beef dish and my boyfriend had the shrimp.  Both were great.  The ambiance was nice.  I would definitely stop by here again for their happy hour.  The bar looked nice and crowded.\n\nThe tables were close together, but not so much so that you could hear the person next to you, which was nice.  \n\nAnd finally, the ultimate compliment came from my boyfriend, who's favorite fast food restaurant is Chipotle...he said this place was better than Chipotle.

They start you off with chips and three different kinds of salsa. It's not like the regular chunky tomato salsa at all, but all three are unique, which makes it extra hard to stop filling yourself up on chips before your meal comes.\n\nWhen our entrees came, I was speechless at how giant the portions were. The chili verde came on a huge plate, that was primarily covered with the most tender pork in a really great herb-y and spicy sauce. The ratio of rice and beans was also perfect, although I would've liked more of the cabbage salad because I loved the vinegar-y taste to balance everything out. Usually chicken is my number one choice for meat, but when the pork is this tender I can't decide which is better! My boyfriend had the chicken mole, which came with the biggest pieces of chicken I've ever seen at a restaurant. The flavor was nice and smokey, and the meat was also cooked well.\n\nWhat was even better was that I ended up with enough leftovers for another meal, and it tasted just as good the next day.

Lunchtime gets super busy, and for groups larger than 2 it can really be a chore. We finally got a table, and waited for our food. The weird thing about this place, is that they don't bring all of the food together. Each item came separately and between my burritto and my mother's soup there was a good 15 minutes. It makes it kind of awkward when you're eating with a group. \n\nThat being said, the food is amazing. The burrittos are HUGE and super yummy. I always opt for the Veggie will all the fixings.

It was still HH at the bar (great prices, need to make it back just for this) but we were able to put our name on the list for dinner, which starts service at 5:30. We ended up waiting about an hour and a half for our 3rd person; our reservation came and went, but the amazing hostess (who we had plenty of time to observe as she deftly handled the crowds coming at her from every channel) took care of us and we were seated as soon as #3 arrived.\n\nThe ambiance is warm and relaxed. Some tables are close, but not too imposing. It creates a comfortable coziness, I think. The chips and salsa was promptly delivered and drink orders were taken. The chips are light, thin, and warm and the 3 salsas range from mild to a wee bit spicy.

But only at lunch. Very disorienting.\n\nThe menu is a large blanket-looking object hanging from the wall and is hard to read. So you basically walk in, read the blanket, talk to the line cooks, make your way down to the cash register and pay, get a stanchion with your number, find a seat and they'll bring you your food. And if you want salsa, there's a salsa station over by the bar.\n\nGood food, good atmosphere, just hard to navigate.

I'm starving just writing about this and I'm on my plane ride home where the authentic Mexican food, while remarkable, is not at all veggie friendly unless you want to go to Chipotle and I don't.) Plus all those carbs, well, they fill you up so one burrito a day is the thriftiest way to go.\n\nI went to Tropisueno for lunch yesterday due to its proximity to Yelp HQ and oh my...it did *not* disappoint. I asked for my usual \"extra EXTRA, no seriously EXTRA\" hottest sauce they've got and hoped for the best. Sadly, what they gave me didn't even approach \"extra\" (I think they forgot, or didn't believe me, but I all but pleaded with the counter lady. I may look like a gringa, I'm a hot sauce addict). Unlike the lower brow joints in the Mission, they don't have the ubiquitous squeeze bottles of possibly the best salsa in the world, so that was a slight drawback (maybe I just didn't see them? Maybe I should have asked for a quart of hot salsa on the side? By the register, they had tiny packets of cholula or a similar hot sauce, so I grabbed a bunch of those, but in San Francisco, I want some of that salsa opium fix.)\n\nHowever, *Hold the presses* because for once in my life, I did not even need to drown my burrito in hot sauce and why? Because the ingredients were *that* good. I also didn't even need--brace yourselves for this one--salt! I ordered a super veggie burrito and it came with just the right amounts of veggies, pico, beans, delectable rice (normally not a fan of a ton of rice in my burrito) and gauc. It may have had cheese, but if I didn't notice it, then it was just enough (the recent former vegan in me knows that cheese is not necessary in a kick ass delish burrito). Just a touch of sour cream and we were good to go. \n\nAlthough I had the best intentions to eat only half and save half for later (it *was* the size of my forearm), I practically inhaled that baby in minutes, while my more sensible coworkers daintily nibbled on less monstrously sized portions of food. Hello, I haven't had a burrito since I was at my fave Mexican place in Brooklyn (Taco Chulo...gotta give them props) and I just couldn't be stopped.\n\nDon't get me started on those warm, salty chips they include in the bag. Again, normally I'm of the camp that chips always need a bit of something extra, whether that be salt and a squeeze of lime (learned that trick from my San Diego pal, Jen E), salsa and of course I'm all about the guac (by the way, anyone else agree that the avocado is the most perfect fruit? I view it as a giftfrom Mother Nature. Or, perhaps it is proof that there is in fact a god/dess). Their chips? Eaten straight out of the bag. Perhaps \"scarfed down\" is a better description of my style.\n\nThis place also has a fun ambiance going on, too. I'm a sucker for a festive Mexican environment and my favorite place on Valencia doesn't have that going on, so I'd look at that place as more of a meal on the go and Tropisueno as a place to sit down and drink some margaritas along with those amazing burritos and chips.\n\nAnd now, I return to Kansas City where the majority of Mexican joints are not really looking out for the non carne-asada lovin' minority, so the memories of this burrito will have to last me for a while. Know something? I can deal with that. And so can my waistline.", "author": "Joi B."}

There's not a clear indication of where you are supposed to go to pick up your GoPago order, but luckily I was with another co-worker who is familiar with the process, and she led me to the cashier area to wait for someone to ask us what the names on our orders were before bringing them out. Since it wasn't really busy that day, we decided to sit at one of the indoor tables even though our food was all wrapped up in foil swaddling clothes. Our burritos came with chips, and I appreciated the salsa bar selection: the three different salsas I tried were all good, and there were more that I hadn't even laid a hand on. A third co-worker who didn't use GoPago ordered her food to-go, but they treated it as an eat-in order, which was fine in our case, but it may be annoying otherwise. We had way more complimentary chips than we could possibly eat in one sitting, so we took our leftover chips and untouched salsa back to the office to share the wealth.\n\nMy chile relleno burrito was interesting, but although it sounded like a good idea at the time that I ordered it, the huge pepper inside was a little off-putting and not as easy to eat. I think I'll go with a more traditional burrito (e.g., carnitas) next time. I probably should have stopped halfway through my super burrito rather than waiting till eating 80% and realizing that I would have to take leftovers with me anyway.\n\nThe verdict: I'll be back since it's right next door to the office. GoPago makes it really quick, too.", "author": "Tiff T."}

The burritos come with a side of warm and freshly made nachos, the salsa bar is loaded with options and they all taste really good.

They benefit from the fact that there are few Mexican restaurants close-by, especially being in the Financial District where everything closes after lunch. So they have some room to slack on customer service without it hurting them much. \n\nThe first time I went, the hosts were not at all welcoming or accommodating, they looked at me and my friend like we were lost. The second time was alright because I sat outside and the outside seats get no service so you order inside....\n\nThe third and final time, I went with a friend, waiting for two other friends to arrive. The general seating area had not been \"opened\" up due to their wacky hours/availability, even though some people were sitting there. Anywho, we saved two (of the 9) bar seats for our friends who were on their way and there were no other seats left (during happy hour, shocker!). Other people wanted to sit in our reserved seats and since there were no other seats, they opted to leave. Some communication of some sort went down and the manager emerged, angrily telling us we cannot reserve seats. After my friend asked why he was being rude, he began to speak Spanish to the bar tender, telling him to stop serving us. Unbeknownst to him, my friend is a native Spanish speaker and caught the comment. They went back in forth in Spanish until finally, my friend told me that we were leaving. \n\nI have NEVER had such poor service at the hands of a manger. Absolutely terrible! What he should have done was offered us the general seating area but he dropped the ball and in the process lost 4 customers for 2 and damaged his and the restaurant's brand in front of many paying customers. \n\nI have been there before when people saved seats at a crowded time and had no problem. Overall, Tropisueno is disorganized and has poor customer service. I should have trusted myself from my first visit and never returned.

It was comprised of 3 different types of pork (one with pineapple, one with chile verde, and one in thick chunks with a drizzle of sour cream), each on a deep fried thick tortilla served with rice and beans. All 3 types of pork were distinct enough to keep me interested (but if they went a little more aggressive on the sauce, I'd be even more happy), and there was definitely enough on my plate to eat. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone with a hankering for some Mexican pork. My friends got the carnitas tacos + chicken flauta and they also found them really good.

I highly recommend them if you're a fan of seafood. I was disappointed to hear that they ran out of the Chicken Mole, so we decided to the Barbacadoa which was alright.

The place was practically empty so I chose to eat in, grabbed my number, scooped some salsa and took a seat in the dining room.  \nI started to read my book and about ten minutes later a group of Alpha Kappa Alphas that had ordered after me were served their meals.  I wasn't sure why my relatively quick order was taking so long but wasn't too concerned.  A few more minutes pass by, with either me reading or trying to flag down a server (I hadn't received my tortilla chips).  I check the time and it was 3:33.  I look at my receipt and the woman taking my order had written down 3:11.  \n\nA server taking a dish to someone else comes up to my table and asks me if I'm waiting for something.  I tell her what I'm waiting for and without a response she walks away.\n\nI'm confused and not feeling any guarantee that she's checking on my food so I grab my jacket, number, receipt and walk up to the counter and say that I've been waiting for over 20 minutes for my quesadilla.  She checks the order wheel facing the kitchen window and I can tell she's saying to the cook that my order isn't there.  He asks me what I ordered and I say a shrimp super quesadilla.  He tells the cashier to comp my order but panic is in her face because she doesn't seem to know how to do a cash return.  She asks a colleague and after a few minutes she hands me nine dollar bills.  \nSo I got a portion of my meal comped.  But not my soda.  Which was clearly on the receipt, that I showed her.  Ridiculous.  I didn't want to press the issue, I just wanted my freshly prepared lunch since time was ticking.  \n\nI do tell her that I'm running out of time so I need my order to go.  I go back to scoop some salsa, this time in take away containers.  I return to the counter just as the cook is putting a shrimp super quesadilla in a to go box.  I stare at my food for a full two minutes before the cashier is free from ringing a customer that is his sweet time deciding on his beverage selection before my order is placed in a plastic bag and in my hand.  \n\nI don't understand where my original order went or why there was no apology about the wait or why I got back nine dollars for my $11 meal.", "author": "Eugene X."}

I like Mexican food, but sometimes feel like it would be great to go to a place where I can get good food, but not have to sit in a complete hole in the wall with blaring Mariachi music and a standard burrito bar.  Tropisueno is the place I was looking for.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I'll still enjoy my typical hole in the wall Mexican dive, but when I'm craving Mexican without the dive-y experience, this is my new go-to!  Also, the drinks were great!  \n\nOnly minor downside, is that it felt really crowded, but we were there on a Friday night and I think we may have experienced some of the spillover from the Happy Hour, after work crowd.", "author": "Michelle D."}

Long wait, they'll text me.  We wait across the street in the park while the 5 kids played.  After an hour and 15 min we walk back to check in and see how much longer.\n\"Oh we texted you 40 min ago.  Held the table for 20 min then let it go.\" I never got a text. \"Yes you did.  You texted right back and said you were on your way.\"  Um, no.  I really didn't. \"Oh whoops, technical glitch, text never went out.  We can seat you in an hour. Drinks and apps outside while you wait?\"  So we go outside and wait.  Drinks for kids, drinks for adults.  Chips for all. 15 min later I'm asked to come look at a table to see if it's too small for all of us.  I go, looks good, we'll take it. \"Ok, give us a few minutes to prep the table.\"  I go back outside.  And wait.  Manager comes out 20 min later.  \"We close at 10p are you going to want the table?\"  Um, yes.  I said that.  I was waiting for you to get us when it was ready.  (I'm thinking I'm stuck in a communication black hole and this is a joke.)\nSo we sit.  We order.  We were given one quesadilla we didn't order (but were charged for).  We were not given an ordered burrito.  But it came out later. My meat was cooked the opposite of what I asked for.  The beans were the other kind we didn't ask for.  Food was fine.  Just not what we ordered.\nIt was truly a comical experience.  Best part is we were with out of town friends, our kids met and got along great.

It had ambiance, it was quiet (for a full house) and easy to hold an intimate conversation, the service was excellent and the food was delicious and very well priced.\nThe meal starts with warm, thin corn tortilla chips with 3 types of salsa-yum! I had a drink special which was a watermelon Margarita ($11). The drink was strong with the flavor of fresh watermelon. \nI followed with the Chicken Mole, which came with Rice and White Beans. The entire meal was warm, fresh and perfectly cooked. The chicken almost fell off the bone and the Mole had just the right amount of heat and sweet. The rice was tasty and seasoned correctly and the white beans I mixed into the rice and again were delicious. I only ate about 1/2 my meal and was full. It's a good amount of food. This is the best Mexican I've had in several years.\nDo make reservations, which can be done online through yelp.

They bring you chips and 3 types of salsa: green, red and a yellow one that is served warm and reminds me almost of hot nacho cheese from the theater but with a strange tangy taste that I did not care for.\n\nEverything was priced fairly cheap and they give very generous portions. My date and I ordered a small dish and a large entree and it was more than enough. A good tip is to not fill up on all the cups before your food arrives.\n\nThe only reason this is getting 4 stars is the waiters. Although super nice and quick about most things, they actually took a VERY long time to get us our bill and then return my card. Ill I'm trying to do is give them money! I dont get it.

Lunch is served cafeteria style; order, take a number and seat, and food will be served. All the ingredients are great and the rice is excellent; think restaurant quality Chiptole with more options. \n\nThe bar is also open during lunch; lime juice, lemon, and orange are pressed in front of you - the tequila comes in all flavors. I recommend stepping up from the house stock, and paying the extra 1-2 dollars for reposado or higher grade - start with Partida. The vanilla / rock salt is an added bonus and tastes great.\n\nFor dinner, expect a packed house - tourists / hotel crowd, with some locals.

The margaritas with the chilli salt are fab and have a real kick. \n\nLovely atmosphere, buzzy vibe with Latin music on the nights I was in. Had I not been stuffed full of food, I might have dusted off my dancing shoes and grabbed one of the waiters for a salsa...\n\nMenu was great and being GF, I had plenty of options. I had the king prawns in a lime and tequila creamy sauce which was fantastic. Beautiful flavours, with rice, red cabbage and black beans on the side. Big portions and they didn't stint on the seafood which was cooked perfectly and lovely and fresh :-)\n\nGetting free tortilla chips and three types of salsa is great - I got this both times I ate here and water being brought to the table and topped up without being asked is great and a nice attention to detail. Staff were lovely and friendly and second time I ate here (alone), I experienced the same great service and didn't feel at all self conscious.\n\nIf I was back in SF, I would be back here in a heart beat.

Happy hour specials which include $3 draft mexican beers and $5 Margaritas, as well as $ 2 tacos, is only offered in the bar area.  When I arrived at 5:30, the bar was packed.  I always wonder how people get off work so early to take advantage of happy hour specials.  I was able to order drinks at the bar and bring them to their tables outside.  They do not allow food outside though.\n\nI had a reservation for 5:45, which I bumped back to about 6:05 while I waited for the rest of our party.  Even though the restaurant was packed, they were very accommodating.  This place is big with the after work crowd so I recommend reservations.  There were few open tables when our party of 4 was seated.\n\nAtmosphere:  Small, crowded, and very loud.  The noise level is fun if you are looking for some place where you want to feel like you are at the \"place to be\" but it definitely made conversation difficult.  If you want to talk I would not recommend this place for groups more than 4.\n\nFood:  Very good and very affordable.  They bring delicious chips and salsa (3 different varieties) to your table.  I had a $15 carne asada dish that was very good.  Others in my group got the Los favoritos which allows you to pick 3 tacos, enchiladas, and a few other options for $14.\n\nOverall:  Food was really good (not mind blowing) and atmosphere was fun.

Took two of us, one a little drunk but that's beside the point, to find you Tropisueno!!!\n\nUpon entry on a Wednesday at 615pm, we were surprised at the amount of people surrounding the bar. We approached the host, or who appeared to be the host, and told them we were just a party of 2. Immediately, he told us the wait would be 45 minutes. We were welcome to have a drink at the bar while we wait. Sure, but did you even put my name down? No. So I had to go back and ask him to put us on the list. I was quite annoyed at the front of the house already, which doesn't happen that often, and it definitely didn't help that there were a bunch of empty tables inside the restaurant.\n\nFine. Wasn't looking too good for Tropisueno at all and I was worried I'd be disappointed with the rest of dinner. We were super excited as some guy was leaving the bar and told us to quickly go to his open seat.

You just told us 45 minutes which I really think he meant to say 2 minutes??? UGHHHHHH.\n\nWhatever, we went to take our seats and immediately ordered our drinks.

Tropisueno if you are listening, ASSEMBLY LINE! If you served your food assembly line style like many other places do you would cut down on the line, serve many more customers and prevent people from leaving or not coming at all b/c of the long wait time.  For orders that need special attention, someone could step out of the assembly line to make those orders without effecting the speed  or the assembly line.  Seriously take this into consideration for your own good as well as the customer's.\n\nThe prices are a bit steep as well, but the food and ambiance is EXCELLENT.\n\nFor the positives:\n\nThe Chips are awesome and I love that you can get a bowl of them.\n\nThe eating space is very well done.  It has a semi upscale feel, but it is not a sit down restaurant.  Excellent idea and execution.  However for dinner the place transforms into a sit down restaurant, also well executed!\n\nThe salsa bar is great, there are at least 6 salsas to choose from and I like all of them.  There are also other condiments such as onions, cilantro, limes, etc.\n\nThe agua fresca are very tasty, they rotate the flavors, but they are all good (Melon, Watermelon, Pineapple, Jamaica, Horchata, etc.)\n\nThe portions are huge and food is high quality.\n\nSomeone brings you your food to your table.  This is a nice touch and allows you to eat chips and fill up on salsa while you wait.\n\nThey also have a good drink menu and bar, but I do not partake on my frequent lunch visits, I have to go back to work afterwards.\n\nDid I mention that the chips are hella good?

The second time I had out of town visitors again, I was redirected to a weird seatme booking site and only Fri and Sat nights are open for reservations. Unfazed, I tried calling.  No real person answers the phone, instead you get a recording telling you to check out their menus online if you're catering etc. Then they tell you to go to seatme.com to make your reservations. Thinking that maybe they are probably not going to packed on a Sunday night, I left it to chance that we might get lucky that night for a party of 6. Sunday came and my visitors and I were there at 630pm and were told that a table for 6 will not be available till 9pm. The hostess took out her iPad, made an act of taking down my name and phone number and said that she will contact us when the table becomes available. It was an act because the phone call/text never came.\n\nOf course with our visitors hungry, it wouldn't be nice to make them wait too long for a meal.

Everything is very fresh and cooked to perfection. I usually come with my girlfriends or boyfriend during happy hour which is 4-6 PM. During this time, the food is EXTREMELY CHEAP. Before I even dive in, I have to talk about the chips and salsa. I swear that there is nothing like it. Not only are they free but they're unlimited. The chips are toasted warm and it comes with three dipping sauces: salsa, guacamole infused salsa verde & a very spicy cheese one. \n\nThe quesadillas are considered more of an appetizer but the portion is unbelievable. They are absolutely phenomenal. I always order the carne asada quesadilla and I'm full before the third slice (there are four slices). Even my boyfriend who eats like a monster gets full from this. Mind you these are ONLY $5. A steal, especially in the financial district where most of your dining options are overly priced. The decor and service is incredible too. \n\nBefore happy hour (during lunch), it looks like a tacqueria and there is even a salsa cart with a multitude of sauces to choose from. At dinner, they transform into an elegant restaurant with wholesome entrees. The plates are basically a full meal. Whatever you order comes with rice, beans, etc. I also LOVE the dessert. My aunt ordered all three: tres leches cake (which melted in my mouth), vanilla AND the chocolate panna cotta. I loved every single one but I have to say that the tres leches cake was my favorite. They only serve it during dinner time, however, and I'm never there around that time. Ever since, I've fallen in love with it and have been searching for a bakery that serves up a mean tres leches cake.\n\nI find myself coming here very often and suggest it to all my friends whom love it as much as I do.", "author": "Joyce L."}

All of our appetizers, entrees and drinks arrived at the same time which was overwhelming. As an apology for the wait, they did comp us a chocolate torte with warm, chewy churros which were quite tasty. Still, nothing helped alleviate the antics of the creepy waiter. I'm talking winks, table lingering and uncomfortable questions about where we stayed/lived; I felt so bad for my poor coworker who was getting the brunt of this attention! \n\nAside from that, we enjoyed most of the food. Some highlights:\n\n- Awesome thin chips served with three kinds of salsa. One was spicy, the other was verde and the third tasted faintly like beans and was served warm. Due to their thinness, it's hard not to plow into the entire bowl\n\n- Chile Verde: Giant chunks of tender pork in a lovely house sauce. All the main entrees are served with your choice of white, pinto or black beans, rice AND tortillas. If you're afraid of carbs, what are you doing at a Mexican place anyway?\n\nI could have done without the Tacos de Cachete (braised beef cheeks). They're a bit too heavy to start off an already meat-laden meal and since it came at the same time as our main courses, it was doubly difficult to finish. The Camarones (Garlic butter shrimp) were too firm and super acidic from the lime but palatable.

I'd order guacamole (coz the free salsa/guacamole is meh) and eat the free chips and have Margaritas. \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow strange.. their online menu is less expensive than the actual menu at the restaurant!

He actually said \"I don't know, some type of milk\". To be fair, that cake was freaking AWESOME. Tasted light and fluffy kinda like Angel cake. \n\nWhen we exhausted our free Nachos and asked for more, they didn't come with extra salsa ( which I had to ask for twice before I finally got it)\n\nThere is definitely a language barrier as I asked them what type of rice they had and they said 3 (white, black, and refried).. umm ok I think they misunderstood my question.\n\nFood: The chips are excellent. Their salsa is so plain! And, their guacamole (free with Nachos) tastes like bananas and is watered down :(\n\nThe main dishes were very bland, nothing special at all! Very greasy too. Their mexican rice was very typical and bland. The beans were extremely salty and again.. for lack of a better word.. bland.\n\n\n-  2 stars for high price, \"meh\" food and drinks, \"meh\" service.\n\nWINE HERE IS VERY BAD.

Over to what, I still couldn't tell you.  There really isn't any discernible host area, although I could have been just anxious to get my tequila and didn't notice it.  Also, the \"hostesses\" had the personality of chimichangas.  \n\nAnyway, although I can appreciate this due to people overstaying their welcome past happy hour and taking up a table without ordering anything expensive, we were told to go to a small table away from the roped off main area.  A table which was dirty.  Thanks, but I'd rather wait until you clean it before I go sit down at it.  Just a personal preference of mine.\n\nAs far as the food and the booze goes, it wasn't too shabby.  Nothing spectacular, although I did like the chips, but I wasn't bowled over.

They start you off with chips and 3 different types of dipping sauces--my favorite was the green one, though the spicyness of the orange one sneaks up on you in a surprisingly pleasant and tasty way. The portions are pretty generous and the food is well prepared and delicious.

Since we arrived relatively early at 5:30p, we were one of the first to be seated in the dining room. The bar area, however, was totally packed. The waiter was attentive throughout the evening with water refill and chips. The kitchen was prompt in dishing out our entrees. We thoroughly enjoyed our feast with sufficient time to take a leisurely 15-minute walk to the Park before the first pitch.\n\nI ordered the Tampique\u00f1o (thin-cut grilled carne asada). My companions had Chicken with Mole Poblano, and Chile Verde. All three dishes were great and served in good portions. The beef was tender and flavorful. The chicken was moist. The pork was one of the best in the City. This place is WAY better than any Chevy's and the prices are very reasonable for a cloth-napkin establishment.\n\nThe restaurant is very lively, partly because there is no separation between the bar and dining area. Consequently, the loud noise does travel into the dining area; but it did not hinder our conversation at our table.\n\nI titled this review as \"hidden gem\" because the location of the restaurant is in a pedestrian thoroughfare and not visible from the street. Unless you are attending a function at the Moscone across the street, you probably would not see or aware of this place.\n\nParking is relatively reasonable. Approx one block away is the Mission Street garage. The rate is $3/hour, the same as street meters.\n\nI will definite return to try other menu items. Reservation is highly recommended.

Thank goodness I remembered it! I'll skip the boring part here where I complain about Mexican food in the Bay Area. I just got back from eating great Mexican food in San Diego a few days ago and it almost seemed like a bad idea to tempt fate by trying Mexican food in the Bay Area (based on past disappointments at a variety of restaurants), but the Yelp reviews for Tropisueno pretty much echoed what I'd heard on Check Please.\n\nTropisueno is on that little thoroughfare that goes between Mission and Market across from the Metreon. Beard Papa is at one end and I think Amber India is at the other. The restaurant is a moderate size, so I highly recommend making reservations or else you may have to wait a while or sit at the bar. The inside of the restaurant is warm and inviting and smells great. We were sat at a small table and immediately got chips and 3 types of salsa. I liked the orange salsa the best because it was tangy and had some heat, but the other two salsas were also good (an avocado salsa and a smoky red salsa).\n\nWe ordered some ceviche to split as an appetizer and all of us enjoyed it. It had a classic Baja peninusla flavor to it and was enough for 4 people to split. I ordered the chile verde which was really great! Sure it was a little fatty, but there was a really good portion of tender meat along with some very tasty rice, fresh tortillas, pickled onions, and three different types of beans (refried, black, and white). All of us really enjoyed all our entrees (another chile verde, chicken mole, and a sauteed fish dish).\n\nOur waitress was super nice and attentive and the service was great! I accidentally got a cocktail which I thought was just going to be regular fresca juice (watermelon), but it had a ton of tequila in it. This surprised two of my friends as well including one who doesn't drink, but our waitress took the drink off the bill and got him a diet Coke right away. Anyway, blah, blah.

I haven't explored their main entrees beyond the Chile Verde and Tampique\u00f1o, but the latter, especially, is so warm and comforting on the palate.  I would use those two words about a lot of their food at least that I've tried.  The spices and flavors are not explosive or exciting, but more on the soothing side.  It's a restaurant that loves to use sauce on everything.  They gently lay and spread across your taste buds much with the viscosity of lava slowly stretching across land.  This is good for those who can't handle or just don't like to be shocked and upset by a super spicy punch.

Although the interior is a tad kitschy, it still evokes a sense of authenticity, all told. Rich, dark interior, with bamboo roof in areas, enclosing you in a cozy cocoon.  Good start.  We were seated by the window, and I love to people watch, so this was perfect.\n\nWater and chips and salsa come out promptly.  Things are looking up...especially after I try the superb salsa.  So we wait...and wait...and wait.....no service.  I eventually have to get up and ask for service.  Strike one.\n\nSo we ordered the guacamole as an app.  This version was served chunky, and was quite good. Only problem? The thin chips could not stand up to the \"heft\" of the guacamole, and kept breaking off.   Boo!\n\nAlso ordered the seared sea scallops as a starter. Quite pleased with these for the most part.  Cooked fairly well, and presented with a wonderful accompanying avocado-tomatillo salsa.  Yum.\n\nTheir entire menu does reflect authentic Mexican coastal cuisine.  Execution is generally a positive.  So...on that note, on to the entrees.\n\nWe split the Chile Relleno de Picadillo, and were quite pleased.  Wonderful meshing of flavors.  \n\nInteresting note. With entrees, the black beans are served as a side in a separate dish. Not so with the rice.  It would be nice if the rice were as well.  I didn't even eat much of mine.\n\nOur server then offered what I thought was a wonderful suggestion: to try their award-winning mole.  Oooh, yes please, sounds like a plan!\n\nOut comes a full \"chicken with mole poblano\" entree.  Uhh....we didn't discuss the chicken or an entree, we were talking about mole, remember?  \"Oh, I'm sorry...well it's quite good.\"\n\nHrmph.  Thought about sending it back, but viewed this as an opportunity to try another dish instead.  Gotta say, the mole is a knock out.  So good!  But...the chicken served with this dish is bone-in, with the meat very inaccessible underneath the veneers of mole and skin.  I'm not one to eat the skin personally, and would have preferred a different cut of chicken (not leg or thigh) for this dish, preferably one with much more meat to actually eat! Alternately, skin the chicken for us, or serve the mole on the side.  As it stood, we were left with not-so-tidy mounds of bone and skin on our plates.  No es bueno!\n\nOn a positive note, the shared entrees were served split for 2 people, without us having to request it.\n\nHaving eaten plenty of exceptional Mexican food in both TX and NM, my standards for quality Mexican fare are pretty high, especially considering I know how incredibly bloated and stuffed I will feel afterwards!  All in all, pretty average with a couple notable exceptions (mole), but I doubt I'd return soon for a full meal, with all of the wonderful food to try in this city.  \n\nFood: 3.5\nValue: 3\nAmbiance: 3.5\nService: 2.5", "author": "Ethan R."}

Anyway, instead of a trip to a sandwich joint that Mr Johnny of the T had picked out for lunch, we made the quick hop to this joint, where I was stuffed with so much Mexican grub that I' pretty sure I resembled a Pi\u00f1ata, albeit an extremely pale one, once the meal was over. \n\nQuality wise, well given that I'd spent the first couple of days in the mission, it was good but just felt a little to reserved and tame in comparison. Good grub, but lacking the sharpness in flavour (oh yeah, I'm going there with the U in flavour!).\n\nIt's good, it done the trick in filling a food shaped hole (several times over) and is pretty convenient.

The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and service was quick. I can imagine that's hard to do in a place like this where it just gets packed. We had people coming to our table multiple times to ask us if we wanted more food, chips, drinks, or just ask us if everything was okay. All in all fantastic service.\n\nI got the steak entree which came with a ton of sides (way too much for me to finish). It was really an enormous entree. Very good flavor but some of the steak was tough, so that's why I'm dinging them one star. If they had just gotten that part right I would have given them a solid 5 stars across the board.\n\nThis place attracts all types -- people flocking to the bar, families, retirees, you name it.

Tropisueno is a great place to meet up with a friend for drinks (bonus points for being in walking distance to Bart, and CalTrain if you're willing).  I came on a Friday night and the wait for 2 was supposed to be 45 minutes, but my gal pal & I were seated within 30.  We split a ceviche appetizer, soup, and the tampiqueno entree between the two of us and it was a lot of food even for 2 hungry girls.  The portions are very generous, especially the soup which ended up more like a stew/small pho bowl sized than a side order.  The grilled carne asada was very tender and flavorful and the ceviche refreshing...would definitely come back again!", "author": "Chinh T."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-13", "description": "I have never really delved into the finer parts of Mexican cuisine.  Truth be told, I never knew there was one outside of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, rice plates, etc.  For that sheer amount of ignorance, I apologize.  My mind was able to be opened when my chonie and fellow smaggit Bollywood was visiting from Hong Kong as a result the gfs coordinated a double date.  We arrived a little early, however, was whisked away promptly  to our booth, tucked away in the back.  Just as promptly, a bowl of fresh chips and three types of salsa were laid before us.  I had a light lunch so that I could chow the fuck out and immediately starting throwing down chips by the fistful.  These chips were fresh made, warm and delicious.  I knew I was in for a treat just judging from the chips and salsa.  There were three, the regular picca de gallo, some green kind, and some orange one (tastes similar to papalote sauce).  The green salsa was so fucken good...drinkable fucken good.  When our bowl was close to becoming empty, it was immediately replaced by a fresh basket and a new plate of salsas.  When everyone was situated, the menu was presented to us by a most wondrous waiter.  He went over the menu, and because I think that he had trouble memorizing it, rapped it out to us.  His right hand was bobbing up and down as he spit out item after menu.  I should have told Bollywood to lay down a beat.  I ordered the scallop appetizer, salmon tartar, and an entree of the salmon special.  The copine ordered the pollo asado.  \n\nscallops: 5/5  The scallops were served in a plantain chorizo hash along with avocado tomatillo salsa.  Delicious!  The scallops were tender and full of flavour.  Pairing it with the salsa and meaty sauce was on point.  \n\nsalmon tartar: 5/5  The salmon tartar was also very good.  It was the day's special and was served along with a side of chips.  The salmon had a slight tangy taste from the minced mangoes.  It tastes even better when you find rolled up chips and shovel the tartar in the crevices.  \n\nsalmon special: 5/5  I usually like to order the day's special b/c you can eat the regular items anytime.  That day's special was salmon cooked in banana leaf with some type of tequila sauce served on a bed of caramelized onions.  It was joined by Mexican rice, avocado, and slaw.  When I first saw it, I cursed myself for eating so much chips.  It was a fucken heap of food.  The rice was a massive pile and I quickly asked for a side of sour cream to mix it in.  The waiter advised me that the salmon was smoky tasting and different and he was right.  The salmon was delicious and unlike any other salmon I have ever tasted.  I cannot really describe it.  The caramelized onions were a good counterpart.  The only complaint that I could possibly give was the sauce was a little too sweet.  It was like candy sauce.  The slaw was refreshing and good to clean the palette.  I love Mexican rice, however, too much and it gets dry.  The sour cream was a good antidote.  In addition, the waiter gave us some hot tortillas and a bunch of different beans.  Protein is vital for aesthetics so I dumped the re fried and black beans in.       \n\nI tried KJeh's pollo asado and while it was good, it was nowhere on par with my dish.  The chicken was very tender and ripped easily, however, like a lot of chicken dishes, was a little bland.  Our friends ordered the al pastor tacos and chicken with mole poblano.  I was lucky and got all the money dishes.  The al pastor tacos tasted as any street taco would and the chicken with mole poblano was straight up disgusting.  The meat was braised in a sauce that contained chocolate.  It tasted like one of those Vietnamese bean desserts my mom used to make which after a spoonful, I have steadfastly refused to eat since.  It would be better if I hadn't sampled my counterparts' tidbits of food, as those little morsels single handily brought down the ranking from 5 star to 4.  If I had not had lady luck on my side, I could have ended up with one of those dishes.  However, my experience with Tropisueno was most excellent.  The waiters were very attentive and were quick to refill water or give us more chips and salsa.  I had one of the best dinners in a while.", "author": "Brian V."}

Each experience was ok, the food was good, the servce was ok there and the set-up was good.  \n\nThis last experience was absolutely terrible.  I normally order a chicken dinner and grub on the nachos and salsa that they provide.  I went out on a limb and ordered the Ceviche Pescado, which was saturated in lemon juice and jalapenos.  I love acidity and spice in my food but for some reason, this was a tad overwhelming.  Since I ordered this appetizer as my meal (I had a big lunch), it was all I had to eat with my corona.  Unfortunately, I found out the hard way that the reason they used so much lemon juice and spice was due to the fact that they served me old/bad fish/shellfish in this dish.  I got home late after ingesting and crashed...woke up 6 hours later to an itchy and swelling feeling, only to discover that I had hives.  This is the worse allergic reaction I have ever had in my life.  I had never had hives before and this experience just kept progressing and sent me to the doctor twice.  Aside from hives, my head and neck were swelling and my glands swelled to almost the size of a golf ball.  \n\nI had not had a bad experience other than this one time but I assure you that I will never return.  If anything, NEVER order their ceviches...I fortunately was able to recover but the hives are probably going to take a week or two to go away and that is with the hope that they do not return, as they sometimes can.

When I got up to grab some salsa and napkins, Sara P. said that some guy who happened to be walking past (we were sitting next to the window) kept staring at my burrito.  Probably because it looked like my plate was having a huge boner.  Once you go.. never mind.\n\nI also chose to have the horchata, but it was a bit too sour (?!) for my liking.  Too bad, as it's one of my favorite drinks.\n\nToo many beans in my burrito (did that sound dirty to you?  Because it did to me..) but that's just a minor flaw.

C'est la vie, we had a nice time anyway. \n\nAs a Mission resident, it's hard to top some of the joints in my hood when it comes to Latin fare, but everything was relatively decent. \n\nThe reason I'm rating them higher is because, although they were super swamped with the after-work crowd, and our entr\u00e9es accidentally didn't get fired so we waited forever for them, is that the servers totally made up for it all. They gifted us some yummy tequila and something-juice shooters and a flan to top off our meal. Hey, crazy rushes and mix-ups happen. We were having a good time and didn't mind. But it's always appreciated when the servers care about your experience. Thanks, guys.", "author": "Christina S."}

Or, is it later in the evening and you are looking to sit down to some awesome Mexican food? Also your place! \n\nTropisueno smoothly transitions from daytime taqueria to upscale Mexican dinner spot.  Their food is fresh and flavorful. They also have the best housemade salsa in town. During lunch, you can get all the salsa you want from the salsa bar. At dinner, they bring you chips and three types of salsa after you are seated. \n\nAs much as I love this place, I have two negative(ish) notes. First, I found their serving of guacamole as an appetizer is a bit small for the price. Secondly, they take OpenTable reservations as late as 15 minutes before the kitchen closes. My friend made a reservation for 6 on her birthday and when we arrived we were told we had 15 minutes to order or we couldn't get food. Luckily everyone made it on time, but it was weird to have no warning about that when the reservation was made.\n\nHowever, I consider these minor setbacks to the awesomeness that is Tropisueno!

It was one of my favorite restaurants until biting down on a small sharp piece of metal embedded in my burrito this past summer.  I brought it to the attention of the manager and his response was \"do you want a refund?\".  He didn't apologize or show any concern that I could've swallowed it and gone to the hospital.  As a result,  I have boycotted them since.  I refuse to come to a place that doesn't care about their customers.

It is a great local mexican spot that can serve as one of my lunch \"go tos\" as well as a great dinner option as well.\n\nThe great thing about Tropisueno is that it has found a way to be a great Dinner and Lunch spot that also features a \"To Go\" window for lunchers on the run.\n\nOne of my favorite dinner dishes is the grilled Salmon with a side of rice and beans. The dish is incredibly filling, yet light and not heavy. The kitchen seems to always grill it to perfection and not dry out the fish, which is easy to do. Additionally, the fresh chips, salsa and guac are a must have on every visit!\n\nFor lunch, Tropisueno is a hidden gem. The \"to-go\" window is a great option for those of us looking to grab a meal and take it back to the office, with the quality of a sit down meal.  Normally I go with a Chile Relleno Carnita's Burrito and load up on pico de gallo and fresh cilantro.  One thing is for sure, the staff at Tropisueno doesn't go cheap on the meat or fresh fillings for the burritos - they stack the contents high and make sure they you don't go unsatisfied.\n\nI promise you'll love Tropisueno and you definitely will not go hungry!", "author": "Justin O."}

I came here at lunch time with a friend and I got the veggie burrito. Often times veggie burritos are just beans, rice, and cheese smothered in sour cream and salsa, but this had grilled veggies in it and made me full in that burrito way without making me feel like death in the way that other mex places often do. \n\nThe place gets crowded at lunch, but there is ample seating. You do end up sitting quite close to your fellow diners if it's a busy time, though, so this is not the place to come and have a private conversation.\n\nTheir salsa bar is absolutely amazing. i tried about five of them and all were good but I highly recommend the bright orange one as well sa the light green salsa.\n\nGreat place.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-28", "description": "Tucked away on Yerba Buena Lane, Tropisueno is a little gem of a Mexican restaurant that is a cut above most of the \"sit down\" places in the Bay Area.  While not necessarily one those upscale Mexican places that are popping up all over the place, Tropisueno is a lively and inviting eatery focusing on the pure, clean flavors of Mexico.  They use fresh, quality ingredients to conjure up faithfully traditional dishes.  And the best part?  The food is cheap!  And, it comes to the table quickly!  The concept behind Tropisue\u00f1o is to offer an inexpensive and authentic Mexican experience.  I'd say that this concept has been successfully rendered.\n\nStarting with the most additively delicious chips I've ever eaten.  Fresh, hot, crisp and salty, the chips overshadowed the well made accompanying salsas (salsa verde and some kinda of roasted red salsa.)  We decided to get a few appetizers and opted for the tacos al pastor and the mushroom and cheese filled empanadas.  They were the perfect starters, small yet full of flavor.  The tacos were served in classic street style, garnished simply with pineapple (standard for al pastor), onion, cilantro and a little red salsa.  The earthy tasting empanadas were topped with a little fresh guacamole.  Wonderful.\n\nOur entrees were the chile verde and chicken with mole poblano.  A sucker for slow roasted pork, I was taken by the depth of flavor the chile verde had.  Unfortunately, I was a little less impressed with the mole poblano.  While the chicken itself was good, exhibiting the taste and flavor of a naturally raised bird, the mole was a little unbalanced.  A well made mole combines chiles, chocolate, spices, nuts and herbs into something rich and complex.  This mole was too sweet, with cinnamon and clove overwhelming everything else.  The standard accompaniment of beans and rice were not mere after thoughts, as is the case in many restaurants.  Here, the perfectly cooked staple could easily be a satisfying meal.\n\nWashing all of this good food down were the excellent $8 house margaritas.  Typically, the term \"house margarita\" is a shudder eliciting combination of crappy harsh tequila and syrupy sweet bottled mix.  Not true here.  This margarita in question is made with El Jimador tequila, fresh lime juice and agave nectar.  The glass is rimmed with a spicy chile salt.  Strong and delicious.  Did I mention it was $8?  Oh, and they drop that down to $5 during happy hour.  \n\nTropisue\u00f1o is the first Mexican restaurant to challenge the hold on my heart that Frontera Grill has.  While not quite as good, I can go to Tropisue\u00f1o anytime I want.  And it's amazingly inexpensive.  Neither of which I can say about Chicago-based Frontera Grill.", "author": "Bryce B."}

The wood latilla ceiling probably set the proprietors back some funds. The decor is inspired and seems as though someone really had a vision for the place at some point. \nOn a Monday night after an event nearby co hosted by the mexican consulate the restaurant was packed. But my high hopes for great food were dashed when the guacamole ($7.50) came out looking like it was purchased at trajer joes three days earlier. The green color was oxidizing into brown even though there was a good amount of lime present in the avocado. Why wasn't it fresh?\nThe biggest disappointment came from the chicken mole entree. The initially flavorful sauce gave way to the discovery of raw...ish chicken underneath. Now I was worried I was going to become ill. But heck two bites of raw chicken never killed anyone or??\nThe rest of the food was passable and better in theory (menu description) than in practice. Again the place was packed, maybe its different on other nights? Maybe people go for the drinks, I cant tell from one visit if it sucks or just an off night. But if you go... try lunch I hear it is less of an investment all around.", "author": "Savannah G."}

So first the good stuff:\n   1) Chile Rellenos - were not overly cheesy, red sauce was perfect\n   2) Horchata - flavor was just right, but got a bit too gritty at the bottom\n   3) Salsa bar - will leave everyone happy. I liked everyone of their salsas actually, and enjoyed changing up my chip dip throughout my meal. \n   4) Bathroom was really well kept, decor was also well done. Love the booths near the front windows, as well as the wood on the ceilings.\n\nNow for the bad\n   1) I don't like the cafeteria style service. I guess thats what a taqueria is. Or maybe they just do this during lunch time. Anyhow, the wait was long..... \n   2) I was eating there, and yet they gave me horchata in a plastic cup?!?!?! ummmm, why? Seriously, lets keep it green folks. \n   3) They use lard in their refried beans. So if you are vegetarian be aware. Also, you should probably ask for all the veggie options, just in the event they are adding animal products into other items. \n   4) Don't forget to ask for chips, otherwise you won't get them. I think I'd prefer if the staff offered us some while we paid, instead of us having to figure that out from observing people around us.\n\nI will probably return here next time I'm in the area.

Fortunately for me, the norm didn't hold true at Tropisue\u00f1o.\nThe food is as authentic as the decor if not more and the tacos I ordered were just right portion-wise (the entrees on the other hand were massive)!  All of the ingredients taste as if they were just picked right before you walked in and ordered up your meal and it's great for group - a definite draw.\nOne thing I missed out on the first time I stopped in was the trio of salsas they bring out.  I ordered a delicious mojito this afternoon and nibbled on the tortilla chips and salsa, expecting it to be typical munchy bar food.  Instead, the spicy, cheesy, and refreshing salsas kept my tastebuds guessing.  I didn't know what favor would hit me when and how.  All this from salsa?  Good to know!\nThere aren't enough waiters/waitresses and I noticed that we had to wait awhile to give any service, but when we did, all the food and drinks were correct and worth the wait.\nI am so happy my friend and I were lazy today.

Two of us walked in and we were seated immediately.  Upon being seated we were immediately given menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  We explained it was our first visit so we needed to look at the menu and our waiter hovered.  Right as we placed our drink orders (we both got the Tropisueno and it was the right choice) the chips and 3 kinds of salsa arrive.  Chips are warm and salted just like I like them, but a little too thin for dipping IMHO.  All the salas were excellent, but the green salsa (tomatillo) was good and earthy and I really enjoyed it.  Our friend arrives, she settles in gives her drink order to the waiter and we all really start looking at the menu.  Our orders were the Chile Verde with pork cooked so tender you almost didn't have to chew it, Tampiqueno (I think my friend enjoyed it even though the server came two times trying to take it away when she was clearly not finished eating) and mine the Chile Relleno (honestly, I can be wrong but my first impression was that the sauce came from a can, and my meal was not warm, but not really cold.  Also, the rice was so hard a piece of it got caught in my throat.)  Depending on what was ordered, the food ranged from delicious to whatever.  At the end of our meal the server put on our table a little container with lollipops when he brought our bill.  In hindsight we should have grabbed them right away because after he got payment and his tip (20%, mind you) he grabbed the container with the 3 lollipops and actually dropped them on the floor as he turned away.  Yeah.  Whatever.  I would probably go again but would hope for a different server and would definitely order something different.", "author": "Laura K."}

I got the 3 item combo: chicken tamale with mole, chicken taco and chicken enchilada with mole.

I was in Cancun a couple of weeks ago for spring break (I KNOW I KNOW) and spent as much time looking around for unique tequilas as I did frolicking on the beach and saying no to crafts people (no gracias please go away also please do not behead me THANK YOU). \n\nI like the dark aged tequilas well enough, but I am really moving towards high quality silvers, chilled, straight up with a little twist of lime. Amazing citrusy flavors and with the right tequila, very little burn. \n\nIt all started at the bar at Tropisueno where I was taking suggestions from the bartender and this guy sitting next to me, who, it turns out, was the brand ambassador for Fortaleza (How cool is that job?). \n\nI drank a number of unique silver tequilas that night, but the smoothest and best was definitely the Fortaleza. It's kind of hard to find but totally worth the hunt.  As usual at these nicer Mexican places, I like to sit at the bar and graze on the appetizers, and they were particularly good at Tropisueno.  The al pastor taco truck style tacos with pineapple, onion, and cilantro were muy delicioso. \n\nBut wait, there's more. See, the Fortaleza guy, despite having the best job in the world, turned in to a raging lunatic asshole about an hour in to my litlle saunter down tequila lane. I swear we were just sitting there chatting nicely when he starts hurling insults at me. At first I laughed, you know like when a friend starts hurling insults, but this wasn't like that. I don't know if the dude was just a twat and the tequila released it, or if he had untreated Tourettes or what. And I'm also pretty sure I didnt comment on his dwarf-like stature or ask if his mother did donkey shows in Tijuana. \n\nAll I know is that was 6 months ago and I vividly remember the name of the brand he was pushing and have since bought 3 bottles. \n\nWell played sir.", "author": "Jay Z."}

They have the best tortilla chips I have ever tasted.  Their salsas are delicious, too:  red pepper, green salsa, and habanero, in increasing order of hotness.  Everyone, from the tender-mouthed to the Texan, can enjoy them!  I had a shrimp dish that was very spicy, but not too hot, served in a creamy sauce (I can't remember the name)--it was fantastic.  My husband had chicken enchiladas, which he pronounced delicious.  Service is fast and organized.

I stroll right on up, get in its face, make sweet love to their chili relleno burritos, and then, with a smug sense of dominance and superiority, I drop my ten-spot at the register and walk away feeling like a man.\n\nI might have even fist-bumped someone on my way out the door... \n\nYes, I know this place is open in the evenings. I've been, and it's pretty darn good. I recall some delicious tacos with pineapple and cilantro on top, and an excellent dish that was comprised of a fried corn masa shell stuffed with chorizo and cheese. And sure, I'd go back again for an evening/dinner rendezvous, but I gotta say, I'm a guy who likes to handle my floozies on MY time, and only during daylight hours. It keeps'em from expecting too much.\n\nSo when all is said and done, I'm gonna stick to the lunch hour trysts. I like my super chili relleno burrito, all battered and fried golden, the melted cheese like a flaxen maiden of yore. And I even enjoy my moments with the darker-featured, though equally sexy super carnitas burrito. So meaty, and just all man. Mmmmm. And hell, since we're on the topic, I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm tempted by the occasional tamale from time to time. Doesn't make me less of a man.

Their $5 margaritas are strong, their small plates are actually pretty big, and if you make it in on time you can have a whole meal plus drinks for not a whole lot at all. They serve standard fares like tacos, flautas, quesadilla, and ceviche, and everything we ordered was tasty.\n\nI have also been here for dinner, and their entrees are actually quite good, and real big too. I would recommend splitting a big entree and getting one or two appetizers. We had Molotes de Elote y Chorizo, which are chorizo-filled corn mesa goodness that's deep fried and served on a bed of beans. DELICIOUS. Their Mole Poblano sauce is also amazing. Makes me want to order more rice and sop it all up!\n\nDinner can get busy tho.

The waiter was nice enough to bring us a sample of their mole sauce, which we thought was alright (had better mole elsewhere too).  Overall the menu options were solid yet limited in selection.

That dish is surprisingly easy to screw up, but not here!  \n\nDrinks: I had a cocktail made with tequila and cucumber. (I can't remember the name).

As we walked by, I noticed a bunch of tables were occupied and when we entered at 5pm, there were also a number of people at the bar. The hostess asked how many and grabbed some menus.

As we were leaving, we heard her leading a couple who arrived after us into the dining room.\n\nWe we were refused service because I had a service animal, which was barely visibal (and absolutely mute), though the proper tags were visible. For those of you out there that are cheering for the way I was treated (though illegal), I really hope that you and every single person you care about, never has to be put into a situation where having a service animal is necessary. \n\nThough other restaurants may not have liked that I had brought in a service animal in their place of business,I have always gotten positive comments when leaving a restaurant from management for my dog being a non issue.

The mole pablano was cooked with 3 chicken legs and one thigh and it was just the right chocolate taste, not overly sweet, and not overly bitter (like some of the moles that I have disliked).  It also had a nice roasty flavor after taste that went well with a scoop of rice or beans.  Our waitress told us that their mole was some kind of award winning mole, and I don't know if that is true and what is their definition of \"award winning\" but it was 5 stars in my book.  \n\nTropisueno was absolutely packed on a Wednesday night at 8PM, when we arrived, and we had to wait about 15 minutes.  I noticed a mixed crowd of people and it had a nice ambiance for a Mexican place and I could tell there were a number of people on dates to the tables adjacent to us.  Classy atmosphere and will have to come back again to try some more of what Tropisueno has to offer.  This restaurant is tucked away a bit discretely in Yerba Buena Lane right off of Market St. so be careful not to miss it when you swing by.", "author": "Albie F."}

This restaurant was a fantastic choice that I semi-blindly picked based on reviews alone. I went with my friend who lived in Mexico and Spain so she knows what good and authentic Mexican food tastes like. She gave this place two thumbs way up.\n\nWe were seated fast on a Wednesday night and served tortilla chips with four different flavors of salsa. I was blown away at how tasty a spicy the salsas were. From my experience, when I visit a Mexican restaurant the salsa tends to be mild and watery...this place has cracked the code of delicious and flavorful salsas. We also ordered a house margarita each that gave us a great buzz to start off our meal.\n\nFor the main course, I order the chicken with mole poblano. The last time I had mole was in Mexico and once again I was pleasantly surprised at how authentic the flavor tasted. The meat was cooked just right so it fell off the bone with little effort. Our waiter asked us if we wanted a side of fresh, hot flour tortillas and beans which we excitedly said \"yes\" to. The combination or flavors, textures, and spices were perfect and made for a delightful dinner.\n\nThe service was great too. Our waiter was attentive and we didn't feel rushed.

This is how bad this shit is.\n\nMy Jim G. and I came on our weekly dine out night. We figured it can't be too bad since it's in a great location, it's mexican food (you can't eff this up) and I was excited to come here since I see it when I go to Press Club. \nWe go in and it's pretty packed. Good sign. We asked how long for two. We were told 10-15 minutes. Now this pissed me off already. No effing way in hell would we have been seated in 10-15 minutes with 3 couples in front of us. I asked if we could wait at the bar and they seated us. No one took our names. Bad sign. I asked the bartender for one margi. ALL I WANTED WAS MY MARGI! He looks up while making 5 drinks at once and said \"yah ok hold on\". \n\n... 2 more drinks and nothing. 4 more drinks. I politely ask \"oh uh,.. how much for my margarita?\". He looks up and gives me a bill. 18 bucks. WTF. 18 dollars for one drink? I was about to flip my shit. Oh btw I still hadn't gotten my drink. I asked \"wait.. for just one?!\" and he says \"oh sorry no.. uh, here.. \" and gives me a tequila sunrise. What. The HELL. I say \"no. I just want one margi. No salt please\". He nods. Makes 3 margis and hands them off to a waitress to give to a table. WHO WERE JUST SEATED. I've been waiting my 15 minutes. No drink. No table. I walk up to the hostess. I told her the sitch. It's been 15 mins. We aren't seated. I haven't gotten my drink. And homeboy can't even tell me how much my drink costs. She goes up to the bar and he LIES straight to her face- \"oh.. No I gave you your drink\". Clearly. Because it's not in my hand. I got a drink on the house. +1 star.\n\nSOOO skip to 12 minutes later. I'm literally yelping other places in the area because this is bs. We finally get seated and the server asks what Jim wants to drink since he's not a tequila boy. He asks for some vodka drink with a specific vodka -I dont remember but the server didn't even know if they carried it behind the bar. WTF. Know your shit. He comes back and says they don't carry it. But suggested 2 other vodkas. We're almost ready to leave and he just says fine and takes it.\n\nNeedless to say... there was quite a great source of entertainment. If Seth Rogan and joaquin phoenix circa \"I'm still here\" had a baby.. this man sitting next to us would be him. He's clearly on a blind or first date with this girl with a banging body- and all this guy does throughout the night is make awkward ex gf and sex jokes. The party to the other side of us is drunk on someones bday and homegirl to my right is plastered and it's not even 7:30 yet. On a Tuesday. Classic.\n\nThe food. Mediocre. to say the lease. I would honestly compare it to chevys. Now.. I love chevy's .. not bagging on it. But I just expected the food to be more authentic.. and .. better. I couldnt stomach to eat my two apps (guac and chips pluse serviche and a side of rice). But then the man tells us after taking our dishes they have FLAN. OMG yes. Flan. PLEASE DONT EFF THIS UP FOR ME!!\n\nThey do. Caramel was burnt. But I dont give an eff. It's flan. +.5 stars.\n\n\nI will never come here again. I will never recommend this place to anyone.

My friends and I decided on this place for our monthly get together.  In an alley with other restaurants, this restaurant was PACKED on a Friday around 7 pm.  The bar area was filled and the entire restaurant was filled up.  Good thing I had reservations through OpenTable which was very convenient.  Decor was a little tropical, carribean but very very dark and very hot.  There wasn't much ventilation and with all the people in there, it got a little uncomfortable.  \n\nWe were seated promptly, as soon as our third party member arrived which was nice, and I didn't even have to tell them that we were all there.  We started with ceviche, which was a little fishy in my opinion and all I could taste was the fish, the other flavors that I attribute with ceviche did not come through.  The onion was light, the lime and citrus was also very light, there wasn't enough variety in the flavors to make me want more of it.\n\nThe chips and salsa are just as good as everyone says.  If I come back to this restaurant, it's for the chips and salsa.  They serve three types of salsa with their complimentary chips and they are all diverse enough to be very yummy.  The light, airy chips were so addicting.  I wish I could eat those practically every day and at every Mexican restaurant I go to.\n\nI had the carne asada which was done with skirt steak that was low quality in my opinion.  It was chewy, very sinewy and was not cooked tender enough.  Maybe I rarely eat carne asada in this fashion but was not a fan.  The enchilada it was served with was nothing special either.  Something you can get at any Mexican restaurant.  The guac, the little dollop that was provided was actually very good like others say.  Chips, salsa and guac, things that most Mexican places shouldn't mess up were AMAZING.  \n\nOverall, overpriced Mexican in a very dark atmosphere that was nothing special beyond the chips, salsa and guac.\n\nAs my friend said, \"This is the perfect place to have a date if you have acne\", lol", "author": "Brian C."}

I like their pork tacos.  Simple, small, flavorful, and a great accompaniment to margaritas.  They offer a creative range of specialty margaritas (i.e. lavender infused with vanilla salt, etc.).  I've only had the House one, and haven't had a reason to try another - it's soo good!  Mild, strong, with a kick of chile salt - ka pow!\n\nAnother great feature of Tropisueno are the prices.  Prices are comparable to Chevy's, which is a run-of-the-mill chain.  But Tropisueno stands out on it's own with personality, flair and a comfy, friendly vibe.\n\nIn these dreary economic times, this is a great place to brighten up without breaking the bank.

The real reason why i go is because i love their salsa bar, especially the creamy kinda coral-orange salsa, it is just delicious. The price point is a lil high, even though i understand is San Francisco down town, but i will apreciate if at lease they are a lil more generous about serving the food. All the timet i order a chicken, or carnitas SUPER burrito, its only super with rice, beans, sour cream, guacamole but i never find the meat, COME ON, they charge like almost 11 dollars  for that burrito, can u make that burrito worth the money we pay for?. If i order 2 tostadas with extra cream and guacamole, its almost 7 dollars for each tostada, its crazy. Now, talking about the service, the ladies who are always encharged of the register have the worst attitude, they are so unfriendly, rude and have such an expresion on their faces that u feel they are forced to be there or either they hate to deal with people. You  guys need to change that, when we get to the register, is the moment that we are giving our money to your business and we want to make sure and feel that what we are  getting in return is worth are money and that includes quality food and great customer service. if those issues are solved you guys will be a really good place to go very often but i feel u guys got very confortable with the business you have at the moment and feel u dont need to change anything, but BE CAREUL!! thats is not an smart business thinking, you can get competition anytime and your business will just drop", "author": "Brenda C."}

But, in good conscience, I can't.  I would give this place 2.5 stars if it would let me, but given the choices, I'll have to settle on 2, because 3 really is one too many.\n\nWhy is that?  Well, while the service was great (although a little slow getting our entrees out), everyone was polite, and the ambience was clean and well-decorated, the food lacked oomph.  The flavors were too subtle for my palate, and everything seemed...well, mushy and wet.\n\nThe menu wasn't terribly original or expansive, and seemed to really be playing it safe with very traditional fare.  The most interesting-looking dishes on the menu were the appetizers, so my partner and I started with two:  The Empanadas de Hongos (mushroom cheese filling) were tasty ONLY with the guacamole on top.  Without it, they were practically flavorless, except for a dull undertone of mushroominess.  The Crispy Flautas were just ordinary flautas, nothing special...but I've had better at any of a dozen other taquerias in this city.\n\nWe then waited...and waited.........and waited for our entrees.  Luckily, we weren't in a hurry that night.  I had ordered two enchiladas, one cheese and one meat.  They weren't terribly flavorful, kind of muddled.  They arrived with rice and white beans.  The rice was just rice, and the beans had no flavor really.  \n\nMy partner ordered the Chile Verde.  That was a better dish - the pork was very tender.  Still, the rice was just rice, and his refried beans weren't special...just refried beans.\n\nWhen I first saw this restaurant mentioned in a Yelp weekly email, I thought we'd give it a try.  But, sadly, it was not a special culinary experience.  In fact, this restaurant doesn't do much over what you can get at any hole in the wall in the Mission, and many of those restaurants do it better.  This place just dresses up the same old thing with a trendier address (SoMa, right by Yerba Buena) and nicer decor.  If you are looking for good Mexican food, you'd be better served by a taqueria in the Mission, or by the comparably more upscale Maya.  There's even an inexpensive Mexican place that has better flavors in the food court of the nearby Westfield Galleria.  \n\nThe only reason I'd come back here would be if a friend was having a birthday party here, but otherwise, I'm just going to file it under restaurants where I was underwhelmed.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't special, either.", "author": "Amy L."}

Not only was this a good choice, but I would go here again. Even though it's not directly on the menu, for dinner, I just had a cheese quesadilla as my meal. It was good and definitely unique.  The cheese had an interesting taste (in a good way) and the flavor of the whole quesadilla was good. Even though we had to wait for a table, the wait wasn't too long and we were provided with chips, salsa, and water while we waited.  The server we had was nice and knowledgable.

I had a ton of food left over, so I took it home and wrapped it into two mondo tortillas which served as my lunch the next day. \n\nMy wife tried the fish tacos and liked them as well.

I also crave their seafood ceviche at random times and need to get my fix occasionally ;)\n\nAnother great thing about Tropisuenos is its location-- a block or 2 from the Metreon, across the street from Yerba Buena bowling and ice skating, and riht off Market Street (not the shady part, either!).  I would recommend this place for a date, but not a super romantic one.  The noise level is moderate, the lights are dimmed, there is a hip and energetic vibe about the place.

I recently developed Celiac's, which is basically a gluten allergy, and most restaurants I have been to don't even really know what gluten is. The most recent time I went here, the server knew exactly what gluten was, and took extra care to make sure my food was gluten free by checking with the chefs and warning me of things that may have some gluten contamination. Big bonus! \n\nThe best thing about this place is their chips and salsa. Thin, warm, and crispy chips, 4 different types of salsa... What's not to love!? Also, the margaritas were delicious. I think they rim the glass with rosemary salt to give it an extra kick. \n\nThe only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars is because of the staff. They are very friendly but a bit... let's say ditzy? The first time I went, the server forgot our drinks several times, and when I went there this week, the server completely forgot about taking our order and came back about 15 mins later and said \"whoa, I completely forgot about you guys!\" Also, when I made a reservation, I had to repeat myself a number of times before the hostess got it right, and then when we got there, she still had the wrong amount of people for the rez.

Though enchiladas are always a staple order of mine, I decided to go out on a limb here and try the shrimp burrito. The shrimps were all kinds of deliciousness.  They were big for burrito shrimp and grilled with some pretty nifty seasonings. The only problem being, there weren't that many of them.  The Tropisueno burrito is big, not small human baby big, but big in its own right.  For the size of this edible creation, there needed to be a larger shrimp to burrito accompaniment ratio.  In other words, I wasn't digging the overwhelming amount of lettuce and beans inside the flour shell. \n\nI have to give them applause for the salsa bar, and more importantly both the salsa verde and the bright orange colored salsa.  Both amazing, but the neon orange was pretty killer.  It resembled orange Tang and tasted like fireworks in my mouth.  Definitely had a kick and went well with their homemade tortilla chips and as a side dip for my burrito. \n\nI'd totally come back here again and try some other menu items.  I was a little overwhelmed by the wall menu and the amount of people lined up behind me.  It reminded me of my first trip to Subway back in 1991- I still have anxiety when I think of that process.

I have been here a few times and these are some of my suggested plates\n\nStarters:\nScallops with Chroizo Hash-Great pairing and balance of flavor\nEmpanadas- Filled with mushroom and cheese. Our server informed us that they have a lady who is dedicated to make these as well as the temal and chili rellenos..That makes me feel that these are very special.\n\nEntrees:\nAlbondigas- Hot and very filling. The broth is very savory and comes with rice... Perfect for cold nights. \nChix Mole- Previous reviews say it all.. I am not a mole fan, but do order it when I come here. \nChili Relleno- usually you find these soggy and way to heavy. Trop find a way to make the batter very light and they fill the chili with a good amount of cheese and covered in homemade sauce MmMMmmM\nChili Verde- slow roasted pork in a tangy balanced sauce a winner!\nPork Chop - forgot the name of this dish, but this one is worth the wait. It takes about 25 min to prepare, but that just tells me that this place focuses on freshness. The spices they use are very aromatic and the chop holds an insane amount of juice. They serve it with a slaw that help's balance the plate to perfection\n\nThere is nothing more I can say about the chips and salsa that has not been said before, but the margaritas I can go on and on about. You cannot really complain about them or their price due to the fact that they are made up to par of what SF locals demand. They are natural, fresh, strong and made with a higher grade of tequila. Our server informed us that it was only lime juice, agave and blanco tequila. :)\nThere infused salts keep me very interested. A favorite drink of mine is the Aztec Manhattan.. PLEASE TRY IT!\n\nThe decor is warm and inviting.. which is always how i have found our service.

We put our name in and were told to expect a 1-hour wait. We were cool with that and planned to drink the time away at the bar. The second we got to the crowded bar and did that stand-on-your-tippy-toes look for the bartender we were greeted with a smile and the bartender suggested that we hover \"over there\" because some people would be leaving soon. A few minutes later we had a pair of seats at the bar. \n\nFrom the moment I ate the first bite of homemade chips and salsa I knew this place would be legit. We ordered a masa/chorizo appetizer that was pretty outstanding! My girlfriend had a pair of beef and pork tacos--I stole a bite of each and they were great! I had chicken and mole sauce which was okay--they serve it as a bone-in leg and thigh which I would agree has better flavor than a boneless cut--but deboning a bird smothered in (tasty) sauce is a little awkward.\n\nOn top of the great food, the service (in our case two bartenders) was really great. They were super friendly and talkative and even made my girlfriend an off-the-menu drink with raw egg whites and a house made pepper infused tequila. \n\nBy the time we left the crowd had died down, the rain died down and we were both stuffed!", "author": "Todd E."}

We gave our name and were told that our table would be ready closer to our reservation time (Reasonable, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed, as I have heard that before at other restaurants only to have to wait around for an extra half hour, depute a reservation).\n\nJust to prove me wrong, at 7:16, they called our name and showed us to our table.  What followed was near perfect service, really great chips and salsa, and a meal that was truly delightful (had the huaraches...huge, but I ate it all!!!).  The only less than stellar part of the meal was that the flan was too much like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e for my taste (I like creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, but not when I want flan).\n\nHaving long ago decided that a decent sit down Mexican restaurant was all but extinct in San Francisco, I was extremely happy to have my preconceived notions about Tropesueno proved completely wrong.

Refried beans had the perfect consistency and spice. The rice was flavorful and crumbly, just how I like it. The beef was juicy and tender. The best part, it's affordable.

Weird fact: I actually heard about this place during a job interview and the interviewer seemed legit enough so I figured, why not give it a try? To my surprise, it has become one of my favorite places to take anyone in the city. \n\nWhat I really like about Tropisueno is that they have typical Mexican restaurant things like tacos and enchiladas, but they also have other more interesting seafood and soups and all that more interesting stuff! When I go there, however, I love getting the plantains as an appetizer, which is an interesting find, especially at a Mexican restaurant. They really grill them well and it has a great sauce on top. For entree, I typically get the three entree-ed, \"Los Favoritos\" with a carne asada taco, chicken enchiladas, and a pork tamale. Omg, the beef in the carne asada taco is grilled so well and the mole on that chicken enchilada - fabulosa - and the pork tamale is surprisingly tender and juicy. Oh and the free chips? Uh, is it just me, or does that seem like a slight luxury nowadays? Maybe I'm just going to the wrong places... The vibe is good, the chefs at Tropisueno seem like they know what's up - all in all, if you're looking for a great place for happy hour, or a nicer alternative to Andale's at the mall, Chevy's down the street, or Chipotle, Tropisueno is that must-go.

Hot deal right? How can you pass this offer up.. yeah that's what we thought. But what it really means is buy 5 drinks (hence bring 5 friends), and you get 1 free (your drink free). So yeah, just had to throw that one out there first.\n\nNow on to the food. My girlfriends and I made a trip up to SF for the weekend and decided to eat here before a night of dancing at Roe. The wait was a little long but that was anticipated as it was a Saturday night so I can't complain there.\n\nI highly recommend sitting at the bar while you're waiting for your table. Not only do you get to work up your appetite, or in my case KILL my appetite, with their delicious chips and salsa (the orange one in the trio is money!) but you can also get a round of their house margaritas! The chips like many have stated are on the frail side so don't load up on too much guacamole or salsa or they'll break on you.\n\nThings you must order:\n+Chile Relleno -- Devine! This was literally melt in your mouth, cheese exploding everywhere kind of good. It's stuffed with beef, raisins, and olives too!\n\n+Chile Verde - There are enough comments on this one so I won't even need to go into detail. Let's just say of the 7 girls, 4 of them ordered this.\n\nThe food was great and the service was even better. An added bonus was the close proximity to Roe. So if you're trying to find a nice, decent priced restaurant in SOMA, check this place out.", "author": "Jessica Y."}

I yelped Mexican food in SF (my personal favorite) and Tropisueno came up with decent reviews. My daughter and I were starving by the time we got to SF and were really looking forward to a great meal. First, this place is somewhat confusing, because it's not a restaurant where you sit down and order your food, it's taqueria style, so you order your food, pay for your food, and take a seat with a number and wait for a server to bring your food to you. I didn't mind, but I just wasn't expecting that. (The woman who took our food order had a very bad attitude, but the man who rang us up was nice). Anyhow, we sat down and enjoyed our chips and guacamole, and a few minutes later our food arrived. The presentation was great..my carne asada (steak) tacos looked amazing, but they tasted awful (they also forgot the avocado I paid extra for). I mean I have never in my life tasted anything so foul. The taste was very sour and I kind of wondered if they gave me the wrong meat or if the meat was spoiled. I let my daughter take a bite and she agreed, it was terrible. The refried beans were luke warm and tasted old. The rice is a Spanish rice and it was very dry. My daughter had a burrito and the entire thing fell apart because there was so much juice from the beans that  the tortilla ripped. She was going to eat it with a fork, but there was hardly any meat inside and she said it was nothing special, so why bother. We both really enjoyed the horchata though. Anyhow, we left our plates untouched except for a few bites, and we just got up and left. It was $40 total, and a complete waste of money, because we left hungry and the taste I had in my mouth from the meat was literally making me gag. Thankfully, we went to a great place in the Mission District called Rooselvelt's Tamale Factory and let me tell you..hands down a MUCH better choice! I really don't know why anyone would eat at Tropisueno. There is nothing authentic or tasty about their food and I truly think I would have enjoyed some roach coach tacos or a hole in the wall taqueria more than I did this place. I hope the owners make some changes, because while this place has potential (a small bar, in a heavy traffic area, nice interior/ambiance) they are falling very short on food/prices/service. Never again!", "author": "Rowena C."}

Average wait is about 5 minutes to order and 10 minutes to receive the order. Total amount of 20 minutes is not too bad considering how big of a lunch rush this place gets.\n\nWhat I usually get is a carne asada burrito. The consistency of their quality really varies based on the lunch rush. Most of the time, it's a good burrito without rips or sauce spilling out. Once in a while, it a burrito with all those problems. Well, nothing is perfect so once in a while is understandable. Their burrito is quite big and contains a good amount of meat, rice, and beans. The carne asada is not the greatest quality meat but it is nicely soft and tasty. What I found out is there's an option to make the burrito spicier by asking them to put hot sauce into it.\n\nThe burrito comes with a nice amount of freshly made chips. There is a sauce bar near the bar area of the restaurant. Their orange sauce which I have no clue what's it call is very tasty with a nice hint of spiciness. There's the regular salsa and other commonly found sauces at this sauce bar.", "author": "Steven B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-16", "description": "As much as I LOVE... I mean LOVE Tropisueno, it kills me to rate them a 4 star... I'll explain.\n\nI have been here many many times, lunch, dinner, happy hour....The food rocks.  Bartenders are pretty good, service is pretty fast, nice atmosphere.  During the week lunch can be pretty busy with all the lunch crowd.  At night its a sit down restaurant as opposed to the taqueria at lunch.  Happy hour has great bar snacks at great prices.\n\nI have been mostly for lunch, so my review will cover lunch in general (as well as my most recent lunch). They have a pretty extensive menu, the combo is a pretty good deal, you can choose from tacos, enchiladas, tamales, or flautas (with chicken, beef, etc).  Now my complaint here is the menu is posted on the wall, and you have to memorize what you want, and then place your order at the kitchen.  There are no paper menus or a menu at the kitchen, and many times I have forgotten my exact order by the time its time to place my order and have to revisit the menu... ugh.\n\nThe orders come with tortilla chips, that are among the finest. They have a great salsa bar with about 10 different salsas... all of which rock, and range from mild to REALLY spicy. The tomatillo salsa is among the best I have ever had. (At dinner they bring you a sample of 3, but you don't get the full bar to choose from).  Orders are then brought to your table, and usually pretty quickly.  \n\nWe both got the 3 item combo, cheese enchilada, carne asada taco, and chicken flauta.  The enchilada was great, really good sauce, and not the kind from a can.  The taco was fantastic, juicy steak, and avocado on the side which I added. My complaint comes with the flauta.  I have had better, and I have had better here.  They cover the flauta in a avocado cream and sour cream, which was pretty good, but made the crispy flauta soggy.  It also was slightly room temperature (and it was the first item I ate).  I would have preferred dippy sauce on the side.\n\nWe also go margaritas.  These are super strong... I mean 2 knocks you on the floor strong. But really tasty. They also have a chili salt they use on the rim that is prefect.  My husband however gets the plain salt since he does not care for the chili on the rim.  There are several different flavors of margaritas to choose from, all with unique salts. I have sampled many.\n\nAdding to their down fall (and therefore unable to get 5 stars...) No fountain diet coke.   If I drank regular Coke I would be happy because they have the Mexican Coke made with real sugar...but alas... No fountain soda, and eating that much good food, I really need lots of diet coke. \n\nBut seriously, best Mexican food. Just could use a couple small improvements..", "author": "David P."}

This place is popular, so be wary of lunch and after-work rushes (like you didn't already know, this is Yerba Buena, people). Reasonable prices for delicious food, even though the wound still hasn't healed over that $1 \"surcharge\" for the chile relleno. The beans are perfectly seasoned with flecks of cheese. Yummy rice, and the plates are  garnished with hunks of ripe avo and shredded iceberg. \n\nNow, LET'S TALK SALSA. This place knows what they're doing. The habanero is incredible. What am I saying?? They're ALL incredible.\n\nGood options for us vegetarians, and there's at least ONE vegan offering on the menu. HOORAY\n\nI prefer to dine during the afternoon, rather than evenings.

I especially like the spicy chicken burrito and their empanadas. As far as margaritas, I'm a die hard fan of the Violeta, but all of them are delicious.\n\nNow for the main reason why Tropisueno has earned 5 stars in my book; the staff.

I looked around and the line was misleading because there were still a lot of tables available, so I knew I'd be able to get a seat.  (This is the kind of place where you order your meal and pay for it and take a number and a waiter brings your food when it's ready.)\n\nThe carnitas taco that I had was delicious and a lot larger than I would have expected.  I felt like having guacamole with my chips, but was eating alone and knew that I couldn't eat a whole order by myself.  I ended up ordering a side for something ludicrously inexpensive (maybe 95 cents?) and figured I'd get a few chips worth.  Well...I ended up getting a full ramekin full of guac that was more than enough to satisfy my craving!  (Well, not *more* than enough because I ate the whole serving!)\n\nThe waiter brought chips that were complimentary, but so crispy and fresh.  I usually don't like most chips at Mexican restaurants, but I couldn't stop eating these.  I also loved that they had such an extensive condiment bar of different types of salsas and peppers.\n\nAlas, I didn't have any alcohol (I was already way too mellow after the spa and was afraid I'd fall asleep), but was pleased to get my Diet Coke in a can (instead of from a fountain).\n\nThe prices were definitely right.  The carnitas taco, guacamole, and Diet Coke were less than $8!\n\nThe location is great (right across from the Metreon), so it would be a good place to hit up before or after one of the museums in the area or a movie.

The ambiance of the dining area is awesome; I recommend sitting next to the window so you can see the sculptures outside. All food orders come with free chips and free run at the salsa bar. I will say that the chips are too thin and too greasy; not only are they shiny with grease, but they oftentimes break when trying to dip them in the pico de gallo. That being said, the selection of salsas is great; pico de gallo, spicier red salsa, two kinds of green salsa, a very tasty orange sauce, and a generous portion of freshly-chopped and juicy limes.\n\nWe got the carne asada super burrito and the chicken torta. The burrito was very good; each ingredient was fresh and tasty, and you can really taste each of them. The torta was a pleasant surprise; the bread is soft and delicious, and the chicken is very tender and tasty.\n\nYou will be filled up with some of the best-quality Mexican food around for less than ten bucks, and be able to enjoy it in a very pleasant dining environment.

The food always arrives with perfect timing, fresh and perfectly cooked, and best of all never bland!  The portions are great, definitely feel I'm getting bang for my buck!\n\nThen, to top it off, they provide some kick-ass margaritas!  Their full-bar has just about everything you could want with your dish!\n\nThe staff is so friendly, watching them interact with each other, as well as the consumers, make it feel like a big family fiesta!

We arrived in time for our 8 pm reservation and were seated immediately.\n\nWe were served by at least two different servers who made sure our drinks were full and our food came out quickly.  Surprisingly, we were in and out of there in an hour and we dragged out the time we spent there.  Service is *insanely* quick... we had a round of drinks and chips, an appetizer, then our entrees, followed by another round of drinks.  In most restaurants, that many separate rounds would have taken us at least 1.5 hours but instead we headed out for drinks at another location before our movie.\n\nDrinks: I'm certainly not a tequila fan, but the cocktails do not taste like it.  Surprisingly deceptive, the cocktails were like juice and I had to be very careful to not drink them as such (the menu warns they have two shots of tequila instead of the standard one you'd expect in a cocktail).  Amazingly delicious and wonderful!  \n\nAppetizers: Free chips with three types of salsa (two were moderately spicy, one was way over my tolerance limit) and two mushroom empanadas (omg they were amazing, I loved them!)  \n\nEntrees: My friend ordered the chicken with mole while I ordered a cheese enchilada, veggie taco and rice.  I wasn't asked what level of spice I wanted in my food so I was a bit taken aback by how hot the enchilada was, but I went for Mexican cuisine knowing I would likely have to experience the heat and flavours... which is what the experience is all about!  \n\nFortunately nothing was over the top for me in regards to heat (other than the one salsa) and I was extremely happy with the amount and quality of the food, the drinks were amazing and the friendliness and service from the staff impeccable.  I'd be more than happy to go back and enjoy the restaurant and its food again!", "author": "Cassandra J."}

First, your chips come with no less than four salsa varieties including a tomatillo (my favorite), a nicely flavored more mild salsa, and one salsa that was burning hot (and oh-so-good). \n\nWe ordered the scallops for an appetizer because I husband loves them and rarely gets them. I don't like scallops. But these scallops were AMAZING! Perfectly cooked so they were slimey or rubbery and the flavor was unbelievable. \n\nI ordered a spicey margarita and it was tasty, but not terribly spicey. \n\nWe ordered the pork chop and carne asada for appetizers and they had good flavor, but were a slight let down after the amazing scallops (thus the four rather than five stars).\n\nPrice: Fair prices for SF.", "author": "Kat S."}

Very fresh and authentic. \n\nWe liked it so much, we decided to come back for dinner and I'm so glad we did. My middle name being Violet, I was immediately drawn to their violet margartia. I asked our waiter what it was like and he let me know if I didn't like it, he would get me something else, which led me to believe most people sent it back but any hesitancy I had was immediately lifted when I took the first sip. This is THE BEST, I repeat, the BEST MARAGRITA I have ever had. It tasted like a fairy drink. The violet was suttle and light-not over powering. It was rimmed with vanilla salt. I would fly back to SF just to have another. The next time I come to the city, this is their bar is the first place I'm going! \n\nFor dinner I had the Chile Verde-very good and flavorful.

Well, everything minus the pozole, the only vegetarian entr\u00e9e on the menu that my long-suffering then-boyfriend was able to gulp down with minimal effort but which I found to be alarmingly bland. Chips, someawesome carne asada and those margaritas proved to be the right cure for the night.\n\nI still kind of don't understand their pyramid scheme-esque drink promotion, wherein if you bring five friends you get to drink free for the night.

Tropisueno is one of those places we go back to because of it's potential but it could definitely improve and be a super amazing restaurant.\n\nTheir chips and salsas are a strong point, flavorful and interesting they've got that down..especially their salsa verde and the smoky chipotle one. As a lover of seafood I would say to pass on their shrimp cocktail which is definitely more American and less Mexican (i hate the first, love the latter). Ceviche is pretty fresh but the lime definitely overpowers and it's missing maybe one more fish to really make it interesting.\n\nTheir entrees are solid with their mole as my favorite. It's chocolatey and spicey in a very smooth way. The only thing that is a bummer is their lack of consistency in food - it's hard to say when it will be good or amazing so if they can work that out I would get it more often. Their meat can sometimes be a little dry but their sides always taste freshly made and the guacamole is good.\n\nI wish they had aguas frescas available for dinner too, but their margaritas are strong and refreshing for those coming to drink.

Highly recommend the plantains, just a tad sweet and crispy enough, with the black beans served with light sour cream perfectly complementing the dish with a savoury tinge. The enchiladas in the cream sauce were very well-prepared too. \n\nWonderful, cozy ambience. Our server was patient, pleasant and gave us some great recommendations. Location is very convenient as well. At the end, they give you some pretty awesome candy.

I liked every part of the meal... The chips and dips were awesome.  They gave us three different types of dips and each was better than the one before it.  We also started with the empanadas and the molotes.  Both were delicious and between those and the chips, I was stuffed before my meal even came!\n\nI had the camarones tropisueno and they were delicious.

My husband and I are relocating to SF and we were in town to look for apartments. Of course, being in Cali, you are guaranteed good Mexican food. \n\nFood:  Well, I'm a little skeptical about fancy Mexican restaurants because I love ordering my quintessential enchiladas EVERYWHERE. Well, their enchiladas do not disappoint! The enchiladas at Tropisueno are different from the ones I'm used to having, which are normally smothered in Jack cheese and melted to perfection. Everything is the same with the enchiladas except they use fresh corn tortillas and Oaxaca cheese instead of jack cheese, but great either way! My husband ordered the Tampique\u00f1o, which was EXCELLENT! It's a must try. The nachos, salsa and all their additional salsa that come FREE are also excellent.\n\nService: Awesome! Our waiter was really funny and just so easy to get along with. He catered to our dietary restrictions and was quick. Food came out fresh, on time, waters were constantly filled and drinks were flowing!\n\nLocation: It's a great location; right next to Bloomingdales.

I ordered a Solo Carne plate with beef and my husband got beef enchiladas. The orders took a long time to come out, and when they did the food was lukewarm x(. My plate was huge and looked good at first, but it was extremely bland and the whole thing was dry. Just a lot of rice and beans and a big portion of \"beef\" with tiny shredded lettuce and one small slice of tomato and a tiny piece of avocado with no dressing or anything made the whole plate very boring and dry.  It was in serious need of some acidity from a salad to break the dullness and dryness of the rest of the plate. The so called beef did not taste like beef at all. It had no seasoning whatsoever and the texture was more like pork. Maybe they made a mistake? But whatever it was, it tasted bad. The most decent thing was the rice, sadly. My husband's enchiladas were bland as well. Can't forget to mention the pigeon infestation they had outside, where we wrongly chose to sit.

Here's what we ordered (all for happy hour prices): \n\nDrinks: \nMargarita de la Casa. ($5/glass) chili salt rim. I was pretty excited about the salt rim when I figured out there was chili powder. yum. Also, these are margaritas are strong - you're definitely getting your $5 worth. \n\nFood: \n- The chips and salsa (free!) are in a category of their own - totally addictive! \n- Nachos. (don't remember the price) The crack chips + beans, guac, cheese, pico de gallo, sour cream (I think...). Good, but would have preferred to just continue with the chips and salsa. \n- Chicken Quesadilla. ($6?) Delicious. Generous portion. The chicken was grilled perfectly, and there was a healthy amount of smoky cumin flavor overall. \n- Flautas. ($3 for 2) Also good, but not as memorable as the chicken quesadilla. \n\nMy girlfriends and I rolled ourselves out of there satisfied, a little drunk, and ready to explore the city for the remainder of the evening.", "author": "Laura R."}

First of all, for being located in downtown SF, it's reasonably priced.  They also make the best spanish rice I've had (that my mom didn't make).  And their mole is AMAZING (again, hints of cinnamon and just plain delicious!!  I'd put it on ANYTHING!)!!\n\nTheir drink list was pretty extensive and featured some interesting concoctions (rose/hibiscus infused ingredients and the like).  I had a couple of beers, but if I'd had the $10, I would have tried one of their signature drinks.  Maybe for next time.\n\nOur server was also very good, and patient, as it took us about an hour to finally order (old friends catching up yadayada), and when there appeared to be an error on our bill, they cleared it up relatively quickly (having an engineer at the table didn't hurt either).\n\nIf I were hosting someone from out of town, this is definitely a place I'd consider taking them!", "author": "Matthew B."}

The house margaritas are strong and the food is pretty authentic, plus it's good quality.\n\nI really do think the major turn off is that they don't realize that their primary market of customers are people looking to \"hang out\". Yes, I get that I can't linger at a table for hours on end and expect my server to be excited about it, but the last time I was there my friend and I were there for about an hour (for dinner) and we each ordered dinner and two drinks, and after our second drink was served and food was still on the table, we were given the \"get the hell outta here, quick\" look and treatment from our server. Bad day? Sure. But just chill out and let us finish! Same thing happened on another occasion with a table of four, all with entrees and drinks. \n\nI checked both times, no wait at the front and there were open tables, so it's not like we were taking up precious space for other diners. \n\nAnywoooo. Just save your trip to Tropisueno for the lunch hour and you will be pleased.

For my entree I got their signature Camarones Tropisueno, which was jumbo shrimp in a chili-cream sauce.  I had never had anything like it, and honestly I was addicted to it.  So unexpected from a Mexican place (where my boyfriend was having the tacos and enchiladas).  \n\nWhat was really weird was that they didn't ask us what type of beans we wanted until we received our food, and by the time they came we were already stuffed and not in need of more food.

For some reason, it was determined by the staff that we didnt need it but should be told that it would be arriving shortly (over an hour of waiting). We ordered our food and I was not impressed. Not particularly let down, but not impressed either. The chicken tacos were average and the flauta (or taquito) was over fried and under stuffed. It felt like i was chewing on just a overly fried-rolled up tortilla. Then, we waited about 15 minutes just to waive the server down to close our tab. I was tired of waiting so i just handed him my card. Lastly, as far as parking goes, there is a large garage across the street on Mission (keep in mind it is packed during the day through the normal work hours).\n\nAll in all, i wouldn't recommend this place for anything other than a margarita. If you want to take a chance on the service, I would say make sure you go during a time when there are very few patrons in order to avoid a poor level of service like we had.", "author": "Derek F."}

Its pulled pork cooked with a green chile sauce, with a side of rice. SO GOOD! \n\nMy friends ordered some sort of steak, and another friend tacos. they were jealous of my chile verde, and ended up asking the waitress if they can have a side of the sauce! The waitress was very nice and brought some out, but it wasnt entirely the same. I think they cook the pork with the chile verde, which makes it sooo much more delicious and savory. \n\nWe also ordered their ceviche, which was also really good.

I eat vegetarian.  While they may not have many vegetarians in Mexico, I'm sure they have a few, and we definitely exist in Northern California.  As a result, I expect places to have more than one dish for me (us?) to chose.  Not here hombre.  They had one main course for me to chose from, pezole.  Good part was that I normally like pezole.  It's sometimes even considered a delicacy.  Unfortunately, Tropisueno's pezole is more a half cooked vegetables in tomato broth mix.

The reviews for this place are great but our experience was really poor and definitely not worth repeating.\n\nPacked, way too hot and noisy.  Service was a little patchy from the host to the waiter.  I know AC is not always necessary in SF but the room was incredibly hot and stuffy.  In fact, it was the hottest thing about the place.\n\nFood was poor.  The free chips and dips were the only highlight.  Flautas seriously lacked flavor, seasoning and taste and if there was chicken in them, I didn't find any.  \n\nTampiquena was better but the bar was now pretty low.  The slow cooked meat was tasty but sadly there was only very little of it.  The enchilada was soggy and unable to support a kitten's breath let alone any meat.  The steak was woefully under-seasoned and lacking in flavor.  The rice was dry and chewy and the refried beans (which I normally love) were dull and flat.  The other dish was equally disappointing.  Some deep-fried corn fritters that were soggy and greasy.  Now I'm not a chili masochist. I don't believe that hotter is better but this food was so lacking in spice or flavor it was incredible. \n\nListening to the adjacent couple arguing with the waiter was an added bonus (just give the guy what he wants. He's paying and he's not being unreasonable asking for a drink to be made how he likes it.  I know the waiter felt that he was being unfairly criticized but seriously, I could have made the drink for the guy in less time than the discussion took about the amount of coke in his JD & coke.  And the guy was trying to be very nice about it all too).  We didn't have any margaritas, which was perhaps our second mistake, but the wine was reasonably priced and drinkable.\n\nDue to the very long wait for food, they kindly comped the flautas.  Which was a relief as I would have hated to have paid for them.  The dog got the rest of the steak and he seemed pretty happy.

The chips and salsa are SO fresh and delicious. The waiter was great; I told him I was vegan & asked about options for me. He admitted he wasn't sure what that meant; major points for him there, I really hate when I can tell someone is unsure of the limitations but tries to fumble their way through. He took his time explaining literally every single option; and there were many. I ended up getting the plantains sans cream. So delicious, and a generous portion size. I will definitely come back.

Making a reservation for four or more is a must especially if you're coming in after work or on a weekend. I came here once when in college and just recently when I went back to the city to visit friends. I highly suggest trying the cocktails along with your endless supply of chips and trio of salsas. Ask for their special margarita menu because they range from original to mango and strawberry, and these specials aren't always listed. For the main entree, I always go the \"Los Favoritos\" at the bottom of the menu and order cheese enchiladas and cheese tamales, that come with beans and rice. It's filling, not too spicey and flavorful. If you need a place to go after a long day of shopping, working, with a festive environment, great food and drinks - I highly suggest this gem that's tucked away in Yerba Buena garden.", "author": "Krutika D."}

So I am only reviewing food here.\n\nMy tamale and enchilada were both good, nothing mind blowing, but  decent.  Big downside:  not served with vegetables of any sort, definitely something I've come to expect from sit-down places in this city.  If this place were in the $ range instead of the $$ range, they'd probably have 4-5 stars in my book.  But if a restaurant is going to charge more than $10 an entree for Mexican, I like my food to blow my mind, or at least set off some sparks with a bit of smoke, and I always expect vegetables, even if I order the chicken.  Otherwise, I might as well be at one of the awesome taquerias in the Mission where the decor is a bit cheaper, but the food is just as good, for half the price (or less).  Plus, this place is just as noisy, so it's not like you're paying for ambience--you're paying for new floors and an artistic gathering of large sticks in a pot in the center of the room.\n\nHowever, it is exceptionally convenient if you are going to see a movie at Metreon, and if you're going to see a movie at Metreon, you've probably already overpaid for the ticket, so you might as well just bite bullet and pay too much for decent, veggie-less Mexican food.", "author": "Sydney H."}

First of all, a few days prior my sister and I walked in and since there was no sign of \"Please wait to be seated,\" we walked right  to a table only to be escorted back by some worker and they pointed at the banner which is the menu and said, you order there. Alrighty  I thought to myself, kinda rude there. We left because we just missed the breakfast menu. Well a day later we went back and got in line and ordered. I really wanted authentic Mexican food and thought maybe a torta de asada would do the charm. The meat on the torta wasn't even asada, more like beef stew in some sauce, not the carne asada I expected. My sister ordered a burrito de carne asada and same thing with the meat, the rice in the burrito seems liked they scrapped the last of what on the pot because her burrito had burnt pieces of rice. The guacamole and chips were ok, the only thing I really enjoyed was my Jamaica drink. Then as we sat and picked through our \"asada meat\" some young lady comes and greets us and places a laminated card on our table. Turns out its a thanks for visiting us  card but get the fuck out by 5:45pm because there are dinner reservations. Um...ok..beyond annoyed at this point. How does a walk in  restaurant (if you want to call it that) where you stand in line to order your food and sit down have reservations?? I mean its like a dam taqueria only a little different because of the seating even then at a taqueria you have a server. And nevermind the owner of the place trying to hook up with the Asian chic at the bar \"bring me back a bottle and I'll repay you in some way.\" Super annoyed to hear conversations like that, how about greet your customers?!?! To add the icing on the cake, as I walked into the \"Ladies washroom,\" the bartender was coming out. Just weird. Food is nasty and over priced. If you like food similar to Taco Bell, then this is your place, its just over priced. If you want real authentic Mexican food, find another place.

We haven't been able to find what we consider traditional Mexican food in a sit down restaurant setting with a server and full bar since we moved to SF last year. We were SO hoping that Tropisueno would fulfill our \"need.\" It absolutely did not. When we arrived, we sat down at the bar for a margarita while waiting for our table. There were at least two false alarms that our table was ready. Annoying. Once we were actually seated, we got our menus and that's where the confusion began. How do you not have quesadillas or burritos on your dinner menu?! Ok, maybe you want to be on the gourmet side so you have \"fancier\" options for dinner but when your website lists all the burritos, quesadillas, tacos, and enchilladas you desire, and then none of them are on the dinner menu, that is odd. I figured I would ask for some quesadillas any way...after all other items on the menu included tortillas, cheese, shredded chicken, rice, and beans they had the ingredients...Well we were brought some chips and salsa and they were fine. Nothing fancy nothing bad just chips and salsa. Well, after dreaming about all the burritos, and quesadillas that were on the menu I was perusing from home earlier in the day, I did not feel like ordering one of their not so traditional entree items. When the server arrived I showed him the menu items listed online and asked him if we could have some of those. His response was, \"those are only for lunch.\" Well fine, my mistake for looking at the menu from my iPhone and not a desktop computer because the option to select lunch and dinner menus was not obvious, but seriously?! How can you tell a customer that you cannot make a quesadilla or burrito when you are already using all of those ingredients to create other dishes?! It's not like I was asking for fried chicken with a soy sauce and balsamic glaze or something crazy. Mind-boggling. Anyway, we both ended up ordering combo plates...mine with a grilled chicken taco and shredded chicken enchilada and my husband the chile relleno and a vegetarian enchilada. We agreed that our meals tasted like they came out of the freezer. Like TV dinners. That was the first time I had ever eaten an enchilada without melted cheese on top...the taco was a small soft tortilla folded in half with a few pitiful pieces of grilled chicken and a few shreds of cheese. My tacos are 10 times better. You might be thinking, \"how can your husband judge the food off of vegetarian or bad choices to begin with, but I will tell you, coming from Louisiana with THE BEST vegetarian and non-vegetarian Mexican food in the country, I thought in a place like SF where vegetarian options are EVERYWHERE, that they would find a way to add flavor to a vegetarian entree...sadly they did not.

It's as good as it sounds.  \n\nThe Chicken Mole was quite disappointing, especially since the majority of Yelpers recommend getting this dish.  The steak Tampiqueno was mediocre at best, with overly-tough (we ordered medium-rare) and underseasoned meat.", "author": "Jen Y."}

We sat in a booth that is tucked away a little and were over half way through our meal when the place started to fill up a bit. One of the guys who worked there walked over to our table and placed a sign on it that read \"This Booth is Reserved for 4 or more people.\" He set it down, without saying a word, while we were eating (the two of us), and walked away.

Not only is everything delicious, but the three-item is a bargain (I've not yet attempted the four-item).\n\nAlso, must note that if you like drinks, you MUST come to Tropisueno.  Their bartender, Manny, is one of my top 3 bartenders in San Francisco.  He does things with tequilla that I never even dreamed of.  The house margaritas are unbelievable (with real agave nectar to sweeten), however, I highly recommend trying one of his speciality drinks.

I think I just like my Mexican food dirty-- dirty as in El Farolito, or Taqueria Cancun. Dirty and greasy and bad for you. Tropisueno just felt a little too healthy for my taste. \n\nTropisueno has catered an office event for my work, I've been there a few times for lunch, and I was there for Cinco de Mayo this year. The food for the catered event and Cinco de Mayo were actually quite excellent. I especially enjoyed the house-made chips, which were oily and delicious. I also really enjoyed the salsa and guacamole at that time, though they were not memorable. \n\nIt's in their lunch menu where I really feel they are lacking, though I haven't quite been able to put my finger on why. Perhaps it is the prices? I feel that it is a tad expensive for Mexican food. I got the salad once, and that was served in a tostada. I didn't like it too much... I didn't hate it, but maybe it was poor choice on my part considering I do not like healthy Mexican food. I got a super burrito another time and it was huge. It was pretty good, but not memorable. I don't think I loved the salsa at the salsa bar either.\n\nThe place is always really busy for lunch, so I advise against going with a big group for lunch. \n\nI did really enjoy Cinco de Mayo at Tropisueno though. It was packed, as were almost all Mexican places in the city I'm sure. They cordoned off an area in the front. You had to push through the crowd to get inside to the bar to get drinks. There wasn't an outdoor bar option to my knowledge (perhaps it was temporarily down?).  The wait was long, but kudos to the bartenders who I'm sure were working under so much pressure. I'd probably been waiting about 15 minutes when this chick in a low-cut tank top squeezes next to me at the bar while we're waiting, plops her boobs on the bar and tries to get the attention of the bartender. After about another 15 minutes of waiting, the bartender ignored her and took my order.  I heard her scoff to her friends and said that she'd gotten there first. Um, no you didn't! Anyhow, I appreciate how the bartender did not fall for her slutty antics and made sure we tipped him well. They had a taco bar for the food, and that was actually very good. \n\nI'm not likely to return for lunch (though I may give it another shot and see if the tacos on the regular menu are up to par).

Cream colored adobe-esque walls paired with subtle arches and dark wood beams make for a pleasant place to eat that doesn't feel like it's trying too hard for its atmosphere.\n\nThe tables were all full when we arrived, but the bar was empty, so we eagerly planted ourselves there.  Same food plus easier access to tequila?  Yes, have some!\n\nThe cocktail list is basically a compendium of everything you could think of to do with tequila (and unless you study the bar carefully, you might be tempted to think that's the only alcohol they offer).  After sampling a number of the various creative offerings, we uniformly decided that the house margarita (a bit pricey at $8) was still the best of them.  Made with El Jimador and agave nectar, it's a little on the sweet side, and quite tasty.  They also fancy up all their drinks with different types of salt (smoked, or chili, or sweet... this was pretty cool).\n\nAs for the food, we started with the guac and ceviche.  For only $7, the ceviche is a HUGE helping of Tilapia, which was very fresh tasting and not too acidic.  I would have loved a little more variation in what all was in it for some textural variety, but it was certainly a good value.  The guac was heavy on the tomatoes, but fine.\n\nThe much ballyhooed Mole Poblano was pretty good.  Nice flavor, on the sweeter side, though I would have appreciated more complexity, and more of a roasted pepper richness, as well as a little kick - it was quite mild.  Definitely not as good as that served up by Fiesta del Mar down in Mountain View (the High Bar for Mole in the Bay Area as far as I'm concerned), but certainly not bad either.\n\nThe Chile Verde, on the other hand, was by far the winner of the evening.  Flawlessly tender melt-in-your-mouth chunks of pork in a heavenly rich green chile sauce.  I would have liked a bit more kick to the sauce, but that's my only complaint.

Fresh ingredients and good sized portions\n- Convenient location (close to parking at the 5th and Mission garages; close to shopping at Union Square and the convention center etc)\n- Reasonable prices - all entrees were in the $12-16 range for the most part and starters were mostly less than $10\n- Nice ambiance - while certainly not fancy the decor was festive and gave a good \"going out\" feel to the whole place\n- Called to confirm our reservation\n\nCons:\n- Service was a little patchy - the waitress put a lot of pressure on us to get alcoholic drinks (asked several times etc) and at the end they seemed to be pressuring us to leave, even though there was no one waiting for a table and there were several other parties still around (it was around 9:45-10pm)\n- Gratuity (@18%) was added to our bill although we only had 5 people in our party.

All of the good Mexican places are in the Mission, but I want one in SOMA!  Came here for dinner around 10:20pm on a Friday night and my husband and I were seatly promptly.  The decor was nice.  It was a casual eatery and not a lot of Friday night revelry, which was perfect for the mood we were in.\n\nChips and salsa were brought out and the chips were just the way we like them-- light and thin.  The salsa, on the other hand, didn't seem like it was made from fresh tomatoes.  Disappointing.  We also ordered the guacamole and it definitely wasn't made from fresh avocadoes.  So first impressions were quickly brought down.  \n\nI ordered the house margarita.  After realizing that agave nectar doesn't mix well with tequila and lime juice, I ordered another without it and was pleased by the quality of the drink.  We ordered ceviche and chile verde and liked both of those.  I was pleasantly surprised (after tasting the salsa and guac) that the ceviche tasted fresh.  But the chile verde was definitely the star of the night, because the pork was cooked to perfection and the sauce was divine.  Delicious.\n\nOverall the restaurant is okay.

If you work in the area, be sure to consider Tropisueno for your next board meeting or networking event.

You got your taco bar, fajita bar, chips, rice, beans, whatever your little heart desires. Order conservatively, though. The taco and fajita bar account for 2.5 tortillas per serving, which is a lot if you throw in the rice, beans, chips and guac. I had 28 college students in the room, ordered the fajita bar for 20, and still had food left over! \n\nAside from their catering service, Trops has become one of my go-to spots for an after work drink.

Noise level in the bar is at just under rock concert loud - so if you are planning on an intimate evening with a lot of pre-pillow talk conversation, you may want to try another spot.  Met up with a friend and we were seated with a reservation right away - recommend you make a reservation, as it was busy and you may have to wait awhile to get a seat.\nThe place has a small outside seating section, but it was starting to get chilly, so recommend that area for daytime only when you can get a little sun, indoor - was nicely decorated - this is what I would call a Mexican+ restaurant.  Not quite a Chi Chi or El Torrito in cliche decor style- a little nicer than any of those.  We were set at a table for two and it was a little small, considering we were served water, cocktails, chips and salsa (three salsa's - orange, green and red - the orange was zesty hot and my particular favorite - but all were good), appetizers and main dish (in some cases all of that was there at the same time, so it got a little crowded on the table).\n\nDrinks - I had the Prickly Pear margarita and it actually looked and tatsted a little more like a Sangria.  Not that that's a bad thing - I really like Sangria, but not what I was expecting.\n\nAppetizers - we shared an order of Cerviche de Camarones - made with shrimp/sweet mango, marinated in citrus with onion and a little bit of habanero spice - not so much that you needed a glass of milk to douse the fire, but enough of a kick that you will want to try more.\n\nThis is when some of the service got a little spotty - we had the chips and the drinks and the appetizer and within a couple bites of the appetizer the waiter's assistant brings our main meals...really?  I know it's busy, but the difference between an El Torrito and this place should be the service and the menu - the menu beats anything you will find in a chain, but the service - you may be expecting a little more for this place.  To her credit, out waitress was very apologetic about the timing of the courses, but I took a star off for that and had them at 3, but put another star back on, as the food was really good here and want to make sure people consider it.\n\nEntree - I had the Tampiqueno - which is thin-cut grilled carne asada, served with a beef barbacoa enchilada and guacamole.  The beef, even though thin -cut was massive and took up at least 3/4 of the plate - but it was cooked to perfection and I did manage to make my way through the entire thing - lucky I didn't fill up on chips and salsa.  Beans - you get three different kinds - Black, Pinto or Refried - I had the Black and they are served a la carte, but were what you would expect and added to the overall compliment of the meal.\n \n Because she messed up on the delivery timing of our meal, the waitress brought us a complimentary \"dessert\" item, which was some sort of deep-fried unknown item with more black beans drizzled with sour cream - a odd dessert in my opinion, but appreciated the effort.  It was more like an appetizer, maybe someone canceled that at another table and she had an extra item...whatever - - not enough of a distraction.  I'd gladly eat here again.", "author": "Steve A."}

I also went to their website and checked out the menu, and the aesthetic of the place is just so incredibly me...so i'm really looking forward to the visit.", "author": "Shannon R."}

All hail Tropisueno!\n\nI noticed that until now my Yerba Buena list had only one 5-star food review on it, for the Chieftain (which is really a bar that happens to serve delicious food).  Everything else around here is either a really divey place suitable only for boring work lunch, or a really fancy/trendy place suitable only for blowing money.  But Tropisueno is the Goldilocks option.  It's sit-down Mexican with feisty but fairly-priced dishes (the Camarones Tropisueno is some top-notch shrimp sauce, and the molotes are the best tasting dumplings this side of dim sum), it has a cozy bar area that's perfect for happy hour, and most importantly, it's that rare restaurant whose decor job is obviously well-funded but doesn't feel sterile.  Plus, it's situated on a pedestrian plaza.  This would be a classic in any neighborhood; in the dicey Metreon-area food-scape, it exerts an almost magnetic pull.", "author": "Wes M."}

The food here is as good as it gets.  I hope they are paying the chefs well as losing them would be a crime.   I grew up eating Mexican food at least every other day and this food is really amazing.  This is my comfort food.   \n\nI understand why people on here say the place is too loud... it can be loud if you have drunk girls celebrating a birthday as it was in my case, but the food is outstanding. \n\nAs for the service, it was fantastic... quick and friendly.  \n\nThe chips were light, crispy, and warm.  The salsa was not spicy and had amazing flavors.  I started with flautas and they were very good... the salsa on the flautas did have a little kick but not too much that made it last for too long.   I had a chicken enchilada, chicken tamale, and a carnitas taco.  I ordered the carnitas as my waitress suggested carnitas... and I am glad I took her advice.... they were AMAZING.  The tamale, while very good was not the best I had ever had.   However, it was very good.  The masa was a bit thick for my taste, but what made it ok was that it was stuffed well.  There was plenty of chicken in the masa/chicken ratio.  The enchilada was also very good.   As for the rice and beans... again very tasty.   \n\nThe entire meal was great... there was not one thing that I ordered that I would not eat again.

We were seated at the only booth-like table that felt really private. The atmosphere of the restaurant felt like a rustic and authentic Mexican home. \n\nNow, for the food. It was really delicious! First, the chips were thin, perfectly crispy, and salted. The salsa was just the right blend of spice and tasted fresh. We shared the empanadas as an appetizer. They were stuffed with mushrooms and I really enjoyed them. For the main course, I had a hard time choosing. I decided to be a little adventurous and went for the chicken mole. I am so glad I did! The chicken was not dry as I had feared and was actually really tender and the mole sauce was the perfect complement. I thought the rice was a saltier than usual, but I actually enjoyed it! The waiter recommended the mestizo for a drink which tasted like a better version of a cosmo. \n\nOverall a great dining experience!

We came in at 11:30am and it was beginning to get packed. As soon as 12pm came, the restaurant was full. The layout of the seats certainly causes trouble for large parties, say 6 or more, as the number of tables available is limited. The food was great. I had the super burrito and was overwhelmed by it.

I thought it was a restaurant, so I had to ask a couple people if the line was only for takeout or to be seated, and I guess it was a line formation to pay for your order and grab a number and find a table.  Hehe, silly me, the restaurant looked so nice, I seriously thought it was sit down formal style with hostess and waiter service.\n\nAnyways, the FOOD.  We ordered a regular Al Pastor burrito and a super chicken quesadilla.  The meat was so flavorful and the portion size was just right for the average price of $6-9, it was good.  Sure it's not Chipotle gigantic burrito style, but the proportionate selection of meats, beans and cheeses is just right.  The salsa bar is to die for.  There are at least 5 different kinds of salsa in addition to two kinds of peppers (the preserved jalapenos and carrots or a whole preserved pepper).

It took a while for me to decide what to get, but in the end, I decided with the regular burrito made with pinto beans and al pastor.\n\nThe burrito is definitely on the large side- the woman making my burrito kept piling on the rice, beans, cheese, and al pastor to the point where it looked like she might have some trouble closing it up.  What impressed me about the al pastor at Tropisueno was the way they kept the roasted pineapple separate from the pork- that way, it retained a lot of its charred pineapple flavor.  It was lovely to get random little nuggets of sweetness from the pineapple in contrast to the salty cheese, smooth beans, and tender pork.  The pork was delicious in that there was a huge dollop of them in the burrito, plus it wasn't overly fatty.  \n\nThis huge burrito was accompanied by a handful of homemade chips, which definitely added some great crunch and texture to the meal.  They were well-seasoned, super thin and crunchy and utterly perfect with the selection of salsas they have there.  I was particularly enamored of the spicy orange salsa- I can't tell what exactly was in it, but it was good.\n\n4 stars for a really good lunch for under $8, especially given that I only finished 1/3 of the burrito-2/3 of it are still waiting for me as a second meal.  I'd definitely be back to try out the other menu items and I can't wait to go back and eat more of their chips!", "author": "Angela H."}

So far, I've been here twice!!  \n\nIt's a cute little spot behind the Marriott Marquis next to Beard Papas.  The Chips and Salsa that they give you is really good!  \n\nOne down side is they are very slow with their service, so look at the menu ahead of time.  It was slow during dinner both times I ate here this week, but it's still really good. \n\nI've never had Chicken Mole before, but it was awesome!!  I don't know what it's made of and I hear that I wouldn't want to know, but I'll keep ordering it!!  \n\nThe Empenadas were good, but I wasn't a fan of the Al Pastor Tacos and I was pretty excited to order it and pretty disappointed that the meat was kinda tough. \n\nDidn't try the beverages cuz I like to stick with my Vodka Tonics, but it looked like they had some fun concoctions!

Very long wait, but I expected as much.  If a restaurant doesn't have a wait on a Friday night, something is wrong.  \n\nThe service was embarrassingly lousy.  Everything took at least 10 minutes to happen.  First we want some chips, we wait 5 or 6 minutes, nothing happens.  We mention it to someone else, wait a few minutes, nothing happens.  Then we get our chips, but we need salsa, we try and flag down another waiter because we have no idea where ours went.  We wait another 5 minutes, he has disappeared.  We see our waiter!  Can we have some salsa?  Maybe some more diet coke?  Okay great, thanks!  Another 5 minutes passes ... where did this guy go?  The food comes!  Awesome.  Do you think we could have some salsa?  and refills?  and ... the beans and rice for the fajitas?  Great, cool, see you in a second.  Another 5 minutes, the food is getting cold, the salsa shows up!  Awesome. Could we have some refills and the rest of the fajitas?  \n\nAnd so on.  Until the very end of the meal.  Even the check was a struggle to get.  \n\nThe only thing that can override how completely lack-luster the service was (and the fact that an entire damn entree was completely cold by the time we received the rest of it -- I mean, what point are fajitas without the beans, rice and tortillas?) was how fucking good the chicken tacos were.  I mean, seriously, I don't even live in San Francisco and I'm considering making a trip just for the damn tacos.  \n\nEat the chicken tacos.  Ignore the bad service.  Don't worry about ordering the fajitas -- they weren't that good, with or without the beans, rice and tortillas.  But for the love of all that's good and holy, eat the damn chicken tacos.

For dinner we had the shrimp cocktail, plantains with black beans, and chicken mole.  The shrimp cocktail is not your typical cold shrimp in a glass with cocktail sauce, it's like a ceviche, but drowning in a tomato based sauce with tons of lime.  Yummmmmm.

(new to me anyway).\n\nLocated in a fun alley between Market and Mission by the Metreon, Marriott and Westin, Tropisueno is flanked by cute eateries like Amber, Beard Papa and Press Club (just across the way). Right from the beginning the place looked good.\n\nInside, lots of soft lighting, warm woods, and friendly staff complete the ambience for a lively inviting experience.\n\nWe were promptly seated for our 7p reservation, a window facing seat. We were immediately greeted by some light flaky and warm tortilla chips served with red and green salsa. Yum!\n\nWith a pregnant friend and having to drive, most of us ordered a virgin margarita, which was still tasty, and looked fancy with colored salt.\n\nThen the eating commenced. We started with the fresh guacamole ($8) and plantanos ($6). I only wished there was more of the plaintains.\n\nFor entree, I tried the Tampiqueno ($14), thin cut of carne asada that had the flavor of the grill. The plate came with rice and guac and a cheese enchilada. I really liked my carne asada, could have done without the enchilada though.\n\nMy friends ordered the Camarones Tropisueno ($16), which was shrimp in a creamy chile sauce. Very tasty as well. Served with rice.\n\nOur entire table was also laden with 3 types of beans - refried, flava (or pinto looking ones), and black beans. We were also given warm tortillas. We were swimming in food. Everything was delicious. Service was great. Our waiter refilled our glasses regularly, came back with extra chips, extra tortillas, and even extra lollipops (Chupa Chups - comes in several flavors, those with cream and those just fruit).\n\nWe were way too full to have dessert (3 options - tres leche cake, flan caramel, or fruit chocolate fondue). Great meal. Total for 4 = about $100 before tip.\n\nTropisueno will be high on my go to list.", "author": "Cindy W."}

Quesadillas were around $8, tacos $3-5. Everything was made to order and really delicious. Their house margarita is really strong but the salt is chili powder like. We went there for dinner the next time and got take out and ordered the same stuff and ended up being twice the price. So I'd recommend their lunch because of the price difference.

I then called the restaurant on Saturday (they were closed on Thursday and Friday for the holiday) and still, no one bothered to pick up the phone. So I had to drag myself in to the establishment (I live 30 mins away), only to interact with a VERY RUDE manager, who told me that my credit card was nowhere to be found. I knew this couldn't be true, because Tropisueno was the last place I used my credit card. Feeling discouraged, I left my contact information with the manager just in case they magically found it. I quickly canceled my credit card...only to get a call from the rude manager at Tropisueno, telling me they found my credit card. It's obvious he didn't even search for my card in the lost and found bin OR someone was planning on using it, until they discovered the manager was looking for it.

These were also very good. Grilled bits of pork with pineapple and more of that delicious green salsa.

Knowing we'd be hungry after our flight I had researched good cheap eats near our hotel in the Financial District and Tropisueno seemed to be the consensus; it did not disappoint. Great casual, inexpensive Mexican fare. As you enter a blackboard lists the menu which features massive burritos for just $6.95 (a venue back home touts burritos bigger than your head and these were even larger), tortas (Mexican sandwiches), tacos and other typical fare. You place your order at a counter, customize your extras (some included such as choice of beans, some extra such as guacamole, sour cream and mole sauce and grab a seat (inside or al fresco) where your food is delivered. While you wait you receive complimentary tortilla chips and access to a salsa bar with a myriad of options. Caution if sitting al fresco; do not leave any food unattended or the local pigeons will help themselves. The interior is set up like Mexican cantina and has a full bar if you want a margarita or what not with your grub, there is even Mexican coke. Arriving in between lunch and dinner on a werkday there was no line and ample seating.

I was expecting a huge line from reading some of the reviews but the time spent in line was probably a total of 7 minutes including ordering and paying. After paying, you get a number if you're eating in and they'll bring the food to you. Sometimes they have it already at the cash register if it's a simple burrito or chips. \n\nThe menu has all the typical fare including guacamole chips, nachos oversized burritos, taco truck style tacos, cheesy enchiladas, chile rellenos, and combination plates. \n\nI got a combination plate with enchilada and chile rellenos, very solid fare. My girlfriend got the burrito. Guacamole chips appetizer were good as well with the semi-salty chips, mmm. My gf and I are light eaters so neither of us finished our food. In hindsight, we probably could have shared an entree so recommendation for those couples who eat light, simply share an entree and get an appetizer. I also got the cantaloupe agua fresca, which was good stuff, not too sweet like some places would have it. \n\nI liked the atmosphere and design of the place. Once you sit down, you really don't feel like you're in the middle of downtown. Rather, you get the sense that you're in Mexico having a lunch, away from all the hustle and bustle of the working city.\n\nOverall, it's definitely a good place to have a sit-down lunch (as well as takeout) if you're in the mood for Mexican food at reasonable prices.", "author": "David N."}

So much so that I went to two happy hours today (perhaps disclosing this fact might not be such a good idea in my first Yelp review, but hey, let's be honest here-- I love my happy hours!).  A little bit ridiculous to go to two in one day, perhaps, but nonetheless worth it.  \n\nI was planning to spend one hour at Tropisueno and the second hour at the other bar, but I definitely enjoyed Tropisueno so much that I stayed later than planned.\n\nI've been to Tropisueno once before-- and I loved it that time!  So since then, we've been itching to return.  The $5 margaritas, which come with a disclaimer warning of high alcohol content (which is the best kind of disclaimer, in my opinion), are tasty.  They were strong enough to make two of my friends tipsy to the edge of drunkenness after two margaritas by the time we left.  \n\nThis time, I just had the chicken quesadilla ($5).  They got my order wrong at first, bringing out a cheese quesadilla instead of quesadilla con pollo (chicken quesadilla), and although I told our waiter it was okay and to forget about it, a minute later he brought a chicken quesadilla for me anyway.  How could I turn that down? I couldn't.  So I got to try the chicken quesadilla, which was juicy and cheesey and good.  \n\nMy friends ordered tacos (beef) and ceviche.  I absolutely adore ceviche.  Tropisueno's ceviche is pretty good, but I wish the fish had been a little fresher this time around.  I thought the \"fishy\" flavor was a little strong compared to the first time I had ceviche at Tropisueno.  But for the price, I cannot complain at all.  And with the bottomless tortilla chips and salsa, I would definitely recommend this place.  \n\nNote:  I would only come here for happy hour.  My cousin and I walked by Tropisueno in the fall while looking for a place to eat, and on a whim we walked into Tropisueno . . . then walked right back out.

The orange one is very hot, so be careful.\nI had the Tampiquano. I'm not usually a carne asada fan because the meat is usually very tough and not to flavorful. This changed my tune on carne asada after one bite. The meat was cooked and seasoned very well. It also came with a beef enchilada. I am an enchilada fan and I deal ok with some heat, but thing was hot. Took a couple of bites, it burned, but I liked the taste enough to go in for a couple more at the end.\nMy wife had the chicken with mole poblano and she said it is the best chicken at a Mexican place she has ever had. She got all the way through it before I thought to ask for a taste! She said it was just the right amount of heat and the chicken was super moist.\nNo dessert.

Perfection realized.\n\nI also ordered the guac and as usual, devoured all the chips before my food came so I 'had' to share my tostada & I didn't roll out of there.  Big chunks of avocado really made this guacamole great.\n\nBaja fish taco... yum!!!  The batter was light and crispy and since I ate all the chips, I piled loads of guac on top and made it even better.  I mean, what is not better with guacamole?! \n\nMy friend ordered the horchata and I insisted he give me a taste (or 5) and it was really good.  I opted for my fav, Fizzy Lizzy.  They have this at my favorite Puerto Rican restaurant (Sol Food) and I'm starting to think this is a good sign.\n\nThe 2 item combo looked delicious and was a huge portion.  I didn't try it, but this non-Yelper says, \"it was good.. the food overall was ok... out of 5 stars it gets 3.3...  the guac though was good... the ceviche was delicious\"  Sounds like you may want to skip the carnitas taco / flautas combo and go my way ;)\n\nI was extremely happy and full leaving Tropisueno.

In fairness, I had ordered the pork chop before and it was bigger and juicer, but this was pretty small. Given that I munched away on chips during the hour I waited I was not really hungry by the time the food arrived anyway (maybe that is their strategy?)\n\nMy wife's shrimp entree was pretty average too, it was advertised as spicy, and maybe it is for the folks in Kansas, but to my taste pretty mild. The only good thing was the price point, one hundred bucks for four adults with drinks, not bad, but I didn't really enjoy the food, which is really the whole point of eating out.

Got my shoes within a half an hour and when we came back our table was ready. Lovely.\n\nSat down in a lively room with dim lights and were immediately served the best chips and salsa ever. My sweetie was all over the smoked red pepper salsa and we ordered our house margaritas. At first glance upon receiving them, you're like, \"Right, this is gonna be good? Look how small this glass is?\" Do not be fooled. This margarita packs a punch and is delicious to boot! Pair that with your salsa and chips and I'm good until dinner comes. We decided to order tapas style and ordered the empanadas, pork tacos, and grilled shrimp. We were still hungry and later decided to order the fish ceviche. Everything was so amazing. The flavors settles nicely and stayed with me all night. The portions are perfect and you won't feel overstuffed. The environment was a mix of couples an d families without screaming kid fest.

That being said, the meatballs in the \"stew\" were hearty and tasty.  The big winner of the night was the chili verde.  Portion-wise and flavor-wise the pork was completely satisfying.  Prepare to ask for more tortillas unless you feel that three is adequate.  The house margaritas felt dinky in both quality and quantity for their $8 price.\nOverall, the experience was enjoyable thanks to the contributions of the chips, the beans and the festive decor.", "author": "Bita H."}

As a new Soma resident, our yelp suggested adventures have been hit and miss, but Tropisueno pleased and surprised us throughout the night. \n\nFirst off, chips and salsa=clutch. Freshly made warm chips and two different salsa options were a nice change from the typical stale chips and gloppy red concoctions at chain restaurants. \n\nThe entrees aren't just good mexican food, they actually taste too good to be mexican food. Whenever I am in the mood for Mexican, I am craving greasy and sloppily assembled street food full of flavor- but definitely not fine dining. This place served us exquisitely prepared food, with all the fun flavor of a taco truck. The ingredients were fresh, the tortillas delicious, and all of the meat was juicy and well seasoned. I had the pork and it almost melted in my mouth. My girlfriend had a two taco combo platter with one chicken and one beef and was definitely satisfied (only 10.95!) We also both noticed that for the first time at a mexican restaurant we both thought everything on our plate was delicious! The beans were great and the rice tasted fluffy and perfectly seasoned (not too spicy or tomato-ey.) In short, every bite was great.\n\nBONUS- they serve you lollipops with your check which is the perfect thing to satisfy your sweet craving after a rich and salty meal.", "author": "Nate M."}

Four were for lunch and one was for after work drinks. The first time I ate here was dinner a few weeks after the restaurant opened last year.\n\nI love how Tropisue\u00f1o is two restaurants in one. At lunchtime, the garage door is open and it's pretty much a taqueria. In the evening, the garage door is closed and there is more formal dinner service.\n\nThe complimentary chips are awesome. Nice and thin. Come here during lunch so you can have the chips with a wide range of condiments.\n\nThe carnitas (I had it with a super taco) were a revelation. They come in chunks as opposed to shredded. Great flavor.\n\nYou can get out of here at lunch for less than $10. One item (enchilada, tamale, chile relleno, or taco) with rice, choice of beans, and a small salad will run you $6.95 (not incl. tax). Wash your lunch down with a Mexican Coke ($2.25).", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

They tasted even better with fresh guacamole. The chips are also really tasty, lightly salted and very light and crispy. I am addicted.\n\nThe scallops are my favorite dish, I didn't really like the poc chuc (pork dish), the meat was dry and quite flavorless. Finally, the mole is just okay, it's done just alright but the beans that go with the mains are actually quite good as is the rice.\n\nOverall, it's a great place to go with groups, just make sure that if you are celebrating a birthday and you ask them to cut a cake for you, that you ask them about a cake cutting fee. They tried charging us $17.50 without telling us ahead of time about the fee. They did remove it after I brought it to their attention so we made sure to tip our surly waiter a little extra for losing the higher check average.

We decided to get 2 remy and cokes and they were whispering behind the bar area (we could still here them though) about whether or not this one bartender had informed us if it was pricier or not. The other bartender then replies to the other guy that \"they didn't ask. so its on them.\" WHAT????? really. We honestly didn't care but the fact that they were talking so LOUDLY about it made the experience worse.

Crispy on the outside, soft and sweet on the inside with creamy black beans. We also started with a round of house margaritas. They are $9, but tangy and strong(er than average).

Accompanied by subtly spicy Mexican rice. For $10 it was SO MUCH DELICIOUS FOOD! \n\nThree bowls of beans were brought to the table. Black, white and re-fried.

Real chicken with real cheese sprinkled on top.  Accompanied by a tall glass of horchada, I was quite satiated - all for around $10.  I'm looking forward to going back for dinner and experiencing the magical transformation from lunchtime taqueria to sit down mid-range dining experience.  \n\nDoes anyone know what Tropisueno means?", "author": "Audrey T."}

I think it really helped that we had reservations. We were seated immediately in a nice quiet little corner, very conversation friendly. The guac was good, we all liked the mint garnish, gave it a little kick. I had a margarita which was mostly tequila. I also had their chicken enchiladas, quite good. Service was excellent and I was thankful for that. Would come again definitely! Love the atmosphere. The nice side of casual.", "author": "Diana C."}

That photo of the mole sold me and we even called to see if they could make it vegetarian- they said yes.\n\nTropisueno has a lot of potential.\n\n Their salsa is really good but lacks in spicy-ness. It turns out that the mole could not be made veggie bc of the chicken-stock in it. I wish that they would've told us over the phone. booo. Instead we ordered enchiladas and mushroom empanadas. It was pretty decent. I must say the best part of the meal was the sour cream and the drinks.

Seems to be the current lunch hot spot - and for good reason! A deliciously festive alternative to Chipotle and (yes, I'm just gonna go ahead and say it) Chevy's, Tropisue\u00f1o is quickly securing it's spot among Yerba Buena Lane gems such as the delectable Beard Papa and trendy wine bar Press Club.*\n\nThe breaded fish tacos were fresh and light(ish) and are sure to become a lunchtime staple. The other day I went in for a burrito, and it was way too salty for me and didn't come the way it was described on the menu. Seems they are still working out some kinks. But since sauce in it's various forms (including salsa), makes the cut in my top 5 favorite foods, Tropisue\u00f1o gets extra props for their monstrous salsa bar (with endless lime slices!). I sure am looking forward to the margaritas and checking out the \"dramatic\" nighttime transformation.\n\n*Sidenote Challenge/Brilliant idea: Spend the day in Yerba Buena lane - Grab some Schoggi Coffee and lil' somethin' for breakfast, pop into the Craft Museum for a while, lunch at Tropisue\u00f1o, midday Beard Papa dessert/snack, peruse the Jewish Art Museum, dine on some quality Indian eats at Amber, and finish off the night with some mighty fine vino at Press Club.

Always randomly searching for the next good place to eat...so what on earth took me so long to discover this place??\n\nI've worked in SF for over 8 months (been yelping the whole time) and not once did I come across the name Tropisueno. Only when I specifically searched for Mexican food near Powell did I realize this place existed.\n\nI came here last night with a friend for dinner and was in love. The place is beautiful, tucked gently away in a corner behind the Four Seasons Hotel and across from an old, red-brick church. As we walked in the church bells began to ring, as though in reverence of our arrival. \n\nWe were seated basically wherever we chose, we were the first to arrive for dinner. There is ample seating all over and even a few private booths for larger parties. The lighting was dim and had a slight romantic air to it; even the rainbow string lights across the bar were pleasantly lit so as not to diminish the aesthetic appeal of the area. \n\nThe chips for dipping were amazing! Crunchy, light and warm. I love warm chips, it makes my day. There were 2 types of salsa- one green, the other red. The green was rather tangy and not to my taste, the red was tasty but not spicy at all. Pretty much everything we ate lacked spice. We both ordered the 2 item combo plate for $9.95 (this same plate is even cheaper if you go for lunch!). We tried the enchiladas and tamales. The portions were fairly decent sizes considering the low price we were paying for it. Not quite hot enough (temperature wise) but flavorful and filling nonetheless. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the place. Good atmosphere, decent food, prompt water refills (I drink A LOT of water), and unforgettable chips. Ohh the chips...mmmm...I'm giving an extra star for the chips alone!", "author": "Scooby D."}

Margaritas are excellent, started chips and salsa are delicious. They're both pretty addicting.\n\nEverytime we come here we have to get the pork chop. The meat is so tender and juicy, and falls right off the bone. It's flavored perfectly and the beans, rice, salsa are great compliments that only bring out the flavor of the chop.

Our first time was for dinner, not many months after they first opened.  The food was quite good.  I had the ropa viejo, and the meat was tasty, well-seasoned, and plentiful.  All entrees off the extensive dinner menu seemed to look delicious.  The decor was upscale but rustic, and the full bar was packed with people.  We ate in the dining room.\n\nWe ate here for lunch the second time, and it was like eating at a different place.  The lunch menu is much more limited to things like tacos and burritos.  It is self-order and self-seating, definitely setting a more casual atmosphere.  Figuring out to line up for ordering in the entryway was awkward and confusing.  But mainly the food wasn't nearly as good.  Soft tacos automatically came on corn tortillas, but we prefer flour.  Everything was fresh, but the meat flavors (we had carnitas, carne asada, and chicken) were not very savory, and seemingly under seasoned.  The strong corn flavor of the tortillas overwhelmed everything else.  The tacos looked good, but they weren't delicious in the way a good taco can be.  It's harder to find a good Mexican dinner restaurant in SF than a great taqueria.  If you want delicious, cheap tacos, go to El Farolito in the Mission, it's worth the effort.\n\nI think we'd go back, but for dinner and not for lunch.", "author": "Dave N."}

Pollo verde.  What the hell?  Chile verde is always pork.  Learn your menu.\n\nCoworker 2: May I please get a super burrito with al pastor.\nTropisueno: (puts pollo asado into tortilla)\nCoworker 2: Oh no, pastor please.\nTropisueno: This is pastor.\n\nWhat did the coworker end up with? Pollo asado.  Actually two of my coworkers ordered pastor and got pollo asado.  Again, learn what's on your menu.\n\nCompletely ridiculous.

I've mentioned before I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food. I grew up in a house where both my mom & dad cooked awesome mexican food. So i'm super dooper picky. \n\nA co worker suggested we go here for lunch. I asked is it MEXICAN or is it \"chipotle/chevy's/aqui\" he said \"no its good. I think you will like it.\" Hmmm ok lets go. \nThe decor is very awesome. Apparently it's a taqueria by day and restaurant by night. \n\nso we walk up and yes you order as you go and pay at the end ( they take amex which makes it good for business lunches). You then get a number on the back of a loteria card ( loved the detail) and you go sit down. Some of my co workers had gotten just tacos so their food was ready by the time we paid. I ordered the chile rellenos. I asked for picadillo- but i actually ended up with cheese. HMM however the cheese chiles were so good I didn't go switch them. I was most impressed by the salsa bar. It had Grilled whole jalapenos!!! My favorite I grabbed one and sat down. YIKES the chile was so hot that I immediately became addicted to this place. \n\nAny Mexican taqueria/restaurant that has the sense to have grilled chiles ready gets my seal of approval!! \n\nTaqueria prices were cheap. We paid $42 for 5 ppl including sodas! I don't recommend for groups over 6 ppl at lunch time unless you don't mind seating seprately.

It was crowded but not packed, so we were able to get in without a wait.\n\nWe started with chips and salsa, house margueritas and the shrimp appetizer.  All of them were really good, especially the magueritas (on the rocks, with salt).  For dinner I had the tampiqueno steak, with an enchilada (+ rice) and my wife had the pork adobada.  We both really liked our dishes, and saw several other things on the menu we would like to try.  The service was great.", "author": "Richard M."}

While I wasn't blown away by the food... or the service... or, well, anything really... it was a welcome change from over-priced sit down joints around the area. The ambiance is chill and offers up an ideal place to grab a tequila inspired drink and chow down on a surprisingly reasonably priced menu. \n\nThe food? The appetizer menu offers a better assortment of dishes which were all pretty good. Go with the scallops in chorizo and the carnitas tacos. Delicious and filling. The entree's were far less impressive. The grilled mahi-mahi and the chile verde topped the table favorite list but the self-professed restaurant specialty, camarones tropisueno (shrimp), was a sad version of any shrimp dish found in the mission. \n\nGo for a drink. Go for a snack. I probably won't purposefully opt to come here again but the food isn't terrible and it's a welcome addition to diversifying the restaurant options for this part of town. \n\nPlus points for being right in front of the Jewish Contemporary Museum... creates a very visually dynamic eating experience.", "author": "Jonny Bobby G."}

My doctor also told me that some people have a bad reaction to ceviche which could be what cause the stomach issue. So I don't know if the issue is \"resolved\", but for as sincere as the owner may be I'm not sure that the staff who was joking around the whole time and the showboat bartender are on the same page. I know how hard it is to run a business and to find quality help, but all it takes is one person to not wash their hands to hurt someone else.\n\nOriginal review for transparency:\n\n\nI'm almost 100% sure this is the place that I got food poisoning from. The night after I ate there I had horrible diarrhea, and it has been about 4 weeks and I'm still not right. I guess we will see what I have when the blood/stool samples I had to give come back tomorrow. I'll update accordingly. The reason I know it was this place is because I went with friends and everyone else got sick in the same way, itd be way too much of a coincidence to say we all got sick from different places at the same time. I guess I just ate more of the \"house favorite\" ceviche than they did, it messed me up bad for a few days.\n\nAs for the service/food: The food was so/so and the margaritas they line up in pint sized glasses and then after making them they pour them into other way smaller glasses..not really worth $5. I had the guacamole, fish tacos, and the ceviche along with some chips.\n\nI will not EVER be returning to this place, I havent been able to drink coffee or alcohol for almost a month now because my stomach is so messed up from whatever bug I caught from this place.", "author": "Chris S."}

For such a large space we were a little taken aback by how few tables were actually there. Waiting for our table we ordered some of the house margaritas from the bar, which were super delicious (and much more potent that I had expected).\n\nUpon being seated we happily started munching away at our bowl of the Most amazing chips you will ever eat. I would probably come here for the chips and margaritas alone, no questions asked. We spent a long time deciding what to order. It was either that the menu was a little too confusing, the lack of real vegetarian options, or we were just too distracted by the amazingly delicious chips (we were on bowl 3 by now). I ordered what was probably a lunch combo plate, but it was rice and beans with a tamale and enchilada. While waiting for our food we continued to munch on chips and order more margaritas, that by the time our food finally arrived none of us were really all that hungry. The food was average, a little dry, and little salty, but still mostly good, but nothing to rave about. \n\nI would recommend this place for it's drinks and chips, but not for dinner. While we did have a lot of fun here, it is not the kind of place I would want to go when expecting dinner, and especially for the price.", "author": "Allyson S."}

The first few times, I chalked it up to the restaurant being new. It's been a few months, and I've eaten lunch here multiple times, and I can no longer give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe food is 4 stars. As far as I'm aware, it's the best Mexican at this price point in the neighborhood. I particularly like their barbacoa, which I've enjoyed on nachos, on a tostada, and as a taco. Guac is solid, and the chips are pretty delicious without being super-greasy. \n\nBut the service. 2 stars. It's almost like stepping into the twilight zone -- often, there's no line, but it still takes 5-10 minutes for someone to take your order (even if you go after the lunch rush). I'll keep my fingers crossed that they'll shape up, and I'll probably still frequent the place. What can I say -- I love me some barbacoa.", "author": "Marisa F."}

Not that what they serve is terrible but it is American Mexican style food. I found the food very bland and nothing more than adequate.

I saw as I was there for a while that they actually had someone going around the place timing the tables. I thought that sucked. I ordered a Pacifico and what they brought me out was like a bud light. Wrong color and definitely wrong taste. I sent it back and they brought me another that was closer but not Pacfico. I see many reviews about the chips and salsa. The chips are a little too gourmet for me but not bad. The three salsas again are not real mexican salsa but more of a sauce. Again not terrible but not what I was expecting. Spending my whole life in San Diego I know my Mexican food and this is not it.

Unfortunately, other things weren't so easy. We were sitting eating our chips and salsa (which were delicious) for literally 15 minutes before a server came over to ask what we wanted. We ordered guac to start, two margaritas, and two entrees. The margaritas came a while (about 8 minutes) later, but no guac. Then came our dinner plates, but still no guac. Then came the bill, with guac on it (no, not a smudge of green goodness, but a charge for something we didn't get). Waa waa. However, when we brought it to the attention of the server, he took off the guac AND COMPED OUR DRINKS. Above and beyond for sure. \n\nThe Chile Verde was AMAZING, but my fellow diner's plate, the Tampique\u00f1o, was a little dry. Three stars for one plate being amazing and the willingness of the server to make up for other shortcomings with discounts (the only other way to my heart besides food).

I walked by and saw an exterior that looked like a hip latin restaurant.  You walk in and you're kind of let down that it's a burrito joint with a cafeteria line.\n\nIf there's no signage explaining how it works or no one is there to greet you (and there should be, it''s a brand new place after all) to acclimate down from the feel that drew you in the first place, then you're not real sure what you're supposed to do and you're let down that muuuuch different from the outside.\n\nI was starving so I stayed.  I ate solo at the bar.  A young woman who appeared to be the owner was with what appeared to be her mother at the bar as well.\n\nShe had her back to the door.  I was the only other person at the bar and she was two seats away and never acknowledged me whatsoever. Not even when I got up to leave did she say thanks..how was everything?

They came in...paused to figure out that it's not a hip latin restaurant after all but a cafeteria-style burrito place...and the owner had her back to the door yacking with her mother behaving somewhat oblivious.\n\nThe food for what it is, I can not deny is decent.  Given the high-brow location however (Four Seasons, Jewish Museum, The Press Club across the walkway, this woman has no concept of service or of managing the problem of customers coming in and discovering that it's not the HIP LATIN RESTAURANT THAT IT LOOKS LIKE FROM THE OUTSIDE.\n\nYou have an authentic mexican taqueria lady, but you need to learn customer service.

None of this freddy-krueger-fingers-chip, so thick it cuts my mouth to pieces\" nonesense. \nThe shrimp was great, the sauce was similar to the orange delight mentioned above, and the rice was seasoned just right.

We had reservations for 6 at 6pm. The place was empty with the exception of the bar. We were seated immediately, which I thought was great. \n\nWe were quickly given chips, salsa and water. Chips were amazing, thin and crispy but  the green salsa was not spicy at all, I was a little disappointed at this. Our friendly server shows up and takes our drink order. Margaritas are amazingly good, but really small and a little pricy.  \n\nFor appetizers we order ceviche, guacamole and fried plantains. All of them disappeared from the table quickly (especially the ceviche, it was that good). \n\nAll of a sudden the place gets completely packed. All tables are taken. People are loud and there is a lady whose phone keeps on ringing every five minutes with the loudest and most annoying ringtone I've ever heard.  \n\nWe order our food, chile verde, mole poblano and tampiquena. All of this dishes came with rice and beans. Rice comes on the  plate, beans come separate in a \"family style\" as our server told us after only one small bowl of refried beans appeared for all of us. Beans were good, but obviously not enough for all of us. The rice was not good at all. it was hard and dry. The chile verde was not flavorful at all. The mole I can't even describe. I decided not to try the other dish anymore. \n\nWe all looked at ourselves with disappointment. We have heard many good things about this place and the experience was just falling through. We asked for our check, not once, not twice, but three times! and still it took about 30 minutes to arrive!\n\nI really think that the place is under-staffed. Our server (it really seemed like she was everyone's server) was running around everywhere trying to help all the people but obviously she couldn't be in all places at once. \n\nOverall I think they need to improve the food. It was just bland, not outstanding at all. Get more staff, seriously! One server for 20 tables is not enough! I felt bad for the lady that was our server at the end.

You'll be happier if you lower your expectations before coming. \n\nWhile there are several issues, the main one is that the food just isn't very good quality - the chicken in particular. The dishes are generally overflavored, yet the flavor is not very interesting. The whole time we were there, we kept wishing we were at another Mexican place, such as LuLu's. It's not bad, but there is definitely better elsewhere.\n\nAlert: this is one of those places where you order at the counter, then (hopefully) find a table, and they bring you the food later. How much later varies widely; with only four people and only normal dishes, some dishes came out so late that others at our table were already finished eating. They bring chips (eventually) which is nice, but they are too oily. And there is frantic music playing - as if someone needed more hypertension - it makes the place more stressful.\n\nSome positives: The combination plates are very large - good if you're very hungry but we had to leave quite a bit behind - and the beans are pretty tasty.

Awkwardly. \n\nBe warned that this place charges you if you are celebrating a birthday and decide to bring in a cake. It's not a small fee either-it was like 25-35 bucks. Not only is the fee ridiculous (we could have bought a cake for that price!), but we also weren't told that a fee would be assessed. When we brought it up with the manager, he wasn't getting it, so my friend Cristy started speaking to him in Spanish. At one point, he just blurted out and said well this is how we do it in Mexico along with other nonsense. After a while, he conceded and it was taken off our tab. Other than that fiasco, no major complaints.", "author": "Jenny W."}

At around noon, the restaurant was pretty crowded. At first I thought there it was a cafeteria-style type of ordering where you get your food and pay for it, but turns out you just order and they bring it to you. For my lunch dish, I ordered the carne asada torta, and it honestly was not the best torta I've had. The bread was a little soggy and the meat was a bit oversalted without the savory sensation that I expect from my asada. One thing I did enjoy was the jicama fresca, with just the right amount of flowery sweetness that was refreshing even in foggy drizzly San Fran. \n\nThe best part about the restaurant is probably the free chips and salsa bar. The service there was splendid as well, and fast! Because the ordering line was too crowded, I approached the bartender and asked how I can get some free chips. She actually sprinted over to the kitchen and brought me some freshly baked chips! Chica was on TOP of it! Kudos to her! And there were probably 12 different things at the salsa bar, and I'm a sucker for options and dipped my chips in practically everything (the chipotle sauce was some spicy goodness) \n\nNice vibe, overall - loved the stringed lights - I guess I liked everything about the restaurant except for the actual main course that I got.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-03-17", "description": "At Tropisieno, it's the small things that really count. I love the way they offer you four different salsas with your chips and the flavored salt that adorns the house margarita. Or. Maybe it's a choice of three differemt kimds of beans with your entree. They are what make up for the things I don't like, slow service being the big thing. Even with a super friendly server, it's hard to ignore a slow kitchen. And, I might be a bit spoiled thinking this, but I shouldn't have to wait fifteen minutes for my two top, not when I have a reservation. And yet, both things are true. I think Tropisueno occasionally falls into that special San Francisco category of places (Frances and Flour+Water come to mind) where no matter what day it is, it's always packed and you just have to wait, wait, wait. I find that annoying, but I can't penalize them too mucj for it. Besides, the food is good. Really good. My camarones Tropisueno really rocked. The spicy chile de arbol sauce had just enough cream amd lime to give it a nice zing and the potion slze was perfect. My friend's tampiqueno (beef, beef, and a little more beef) was equally delicious. So, good eats and some prime people watching saved the meal. Oh, and the excellent margarita.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-30", "description": "I'm giving the food four stars, and the service (including the hostess and their special events planner) only 3 stars. \n\nLet me start with the most important part of this review: FOOD. The trio of salsas each had their own characteristics. The orange salsa had a different texture than most salsas and it was a little peppery hot. It's best to try them all for yourself to experience what everyone is talking about. Next, we had the tacos al pastor and the empanadas de hongos. The tacos were so good with the pineapple and grilled pork. It was like a classy taco from a taco truck. The empanada was meh. If it was served just out of the oven or deep fryer, I'm sure this savory hot pocket would have been crispier and melt in your mouth good. The guac served with it didn't do any justice, but it was a great addition to the salsas and chips. For our main dishes, we ordered the pork chile verde, chicken with mole poblano, tampiqueno and the camarones tropisueno. All were served with Mexican rice, warm tortillas, and black and refried beans. The chile verde was flavorful and the pork was so soft it was easy to pull apart with you fork. The chicken mole was unique and had a nutty flavor. The tampiqueno was the most favored dish among our party. The carne asada was medium well, and when stuffed in a tortilla with rice, beans and salsa, it resulted to a perfect mini burrito. The second favored dish was the camarones tampiqueno. It was a hearty dish of scrumptious shrimp! Lastly, for dessert was tres leches cake. We were so full from our dinner, that we couldn't really enjoy dessert, also Tropisueno does not serve coffee or tea. The tres leches cake was good, but could have done without the bitter sauce that came with it. \n\nIf you are still reading this, cool! Now about the service...the service we experienced at Tropisueno was a bit off. Their hostesses were a bit sketchy and clueless when it came to making reservations for a party of 8. I finally had to make my reservations through their special events planner, Erin. Erin was really helpful and accommodating when making plans for our dinner party. A week before we dined at Tropisueno, she worked with me on creating a set menu to make our dinner party special for the birthday girl. Our server was serious and stiff, just like a strict teacher that wouldn't allow us to have any fun. Also, something happened to Erin's computer that evening and she was unable to print out our customized menu, and as an alternate solution, she came up with simple and characterless menus for us. Oh well. My friends and I want to come back, and next time we'll just expect good food with a so-so service. \n\nTo summarize this long review, great place for dinner and margaritas with an almost below average service. \n\n**diner tip: bring an appetite because the food is really filling!", "author": "Jocelyn P."}

As we were placing our orders, the lunch crowd rushed in. \n\nWhen you first enter the restaurant, the menu is to your immediate left. Get in line, place your order, grab your order number, and find a table. Don't forget to grab your utensils and salsa along the way. \n\nThe chips were lightly salted and perfectly crunchy. I ordered a carne asada super quesadilla, which turned out to be 4 quite large pieces. I surprised myself by finishing the entire thing. Not good for my diet at all!! The guacamole had chunks of avocado in it, just the way I like it! The quesadilla was delicious without being greasy. This is not a taqueria with authentically greasy Mexican fare, but it is a good lunch option for those working in the downtown area.", "author": "Aileen P."}

Leaving the Contemporary Jewish Museum with a hankering for Mexican food, we stumbled upon Tropisueno right next door.   It was packed on a Thursday eve., and the wait would have been over 20 minutes.  But they seated as at the beautiful bar, and we were happy to eat there.  The place is so comfortably and authentically arranged, it's hard to believe it's only been there 3 months!  They've got plenty of super friendly and gracious staff, so they're not overworked.  They were attentive and the food came fairly quickly, even though it was crowded.\n\nIncredibly flavorful food at reasonable prices.  Great margaritas.  Lots of fine touches: toasted corners of the empanadas, the salsa had a very rich roasted flavor, the pozole had a real kick to it, the huge bowlful of warm, light, tasty chips did not last long.  We got three different types of beans that all had excellent flavor and texture.  I was with two vegetarians who were plenty satisfied, though there is room on the menu for more dishes.\n\nOne of the owners was running the bar, and he clearly set the tone for this place, with a very clear vision of great Mexican food, ambiance, and service, and with a calm, low-key approach that made the whole experience relaxing and entirely satisfying.", "author": "Fred W."}

The room and lunchtime ordering are awful. Too bad! At lunch it is always crowded with a line from about 11:30. I go just before. The menu is on the wall away from the lady taking the orders so when she asks about sauces or fillings you have to go back and refer to the wall. If there is a line you really have to swim upstream through the people behind you. Except for seats next to the windows the place is very DARK inside. The bar is on the back wall. There is lots of seating outside, but it is always shaded and cool or cold and windy. I suggest that you go early or for dinner when there is menue/table service.\nThe sauces here are excellent, both the ones on the food and at the salsa  station. The problem is that there is often a line at the salsa station. The food here is authentic  Mexican homestyle food from an open kitchen. It reminds me of La Chata in Guadalajara where you can see the ladies preparing your meal. Tacos (street kind)  Tortas, Tostados, and the useual items. Last time I ordered the Chile Relleno and enjoyed it. They use very good ingredients. The food here is just to good to be wasted on this dark space with very poor flow. I hope that they move to a better space. Oue lastima!", "author": "David I."}

My friend and I shared the guacamole (which turned out to be completely unnecessary because everything we ordered ended up coming with guac), shrimp tostada, and the Tampique\u00f1o, which was an entree of carne asada with an enchilada with sides of beans and rice.  The meat was absolutely delicious - cooked medium-ish with that great grilled/charred (not burnt) flavor, yet soft.  Our waiter brought us all 3 types of beans to try.  I would normally order black beans, but the refried and white beans were delicious too! The rice was kinda salty but still edible. The tostada was really good too, but our flautas were definitely kinda burnt (which was hard to see w/ their mood lighting, but there was definitely some blackness going on).  Another bad thing was that our waiter was hard selling their crap like no joke.  I mean, I get it - sell more, get more tips, etc...but he was definitely pressuring every person to order at least one alcoholic drink.  He did generally have good recommendations for us, however.\n\nKey points: Free chips and salsa, good house margarita (says the friend that had one), and pretty poppin even at 9pm on a Saturday night.

Tequila-y.\n\nThey also passed out samples of microbrews they had on tap. I really wish I could remember the name of them, but the darker amber one is phenomenal. \n\nAs for the food, it's all pretty good. There were these mini nacho chip bowls filled with various things. The guacamole one was great.

After seeing us briefly debate whether we should stay or find another place, our waitress Monique offered to bring out whatever she could for us from the kitchen. She brought out more food than either of us were hoping!! Her extra care and attention to us has definitely made us want to come back in the future. Can't speak highly enough about her service or her sweet demeanor. Tropisueno has Monique to thank for making us repeat customers!!", "author": "T S."}

Their chips were really fresh, and the salsa is fantastic. I had a Corona that was pretty cold, though it didn't come with a lime; which I thought was a little odd. My girlfriend and her friends had the house margarita, which they said was really good.\n\nFor the entrees, I had their \"Pollo Asado\", which was really good though I wasn't expecting an actual half of a chicken to be on my plate. Good nonetheless.\n\nFriends had their \"Los Favoritos\" meals, with some tacos, enchiladas and tamales that looked pretty good.  One of the plates in our party was messed up with chili relleno instead of a tamale. The waiter apologized, said they'd being out a tamale free of charge. Four minutes later, the tamale arrived though as some other reviews have said, when they mess up, the cooks seem to be _very_ rushed back there. The tamale arrived with the corn husk still on, and melted cheese on top of the husk. Pointless, much?\n\nScrew ups aside, the prices are decent for the quality of food you get.", "author": "Jon U."}

Tropisue\u00f1o was our pick and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe four of us ordered plenty of food to share. We started off with lots of chips with salsas and guacamole, as well as their Crispy Flautas. The regular salsa and the salsa verde are very good for my taste, in other words, they are quite mild. LOL. I wished their guacamole were bigger because I can never have enough of them. The flautas were crispy and tasty as how they should be.\n\nThen we had two orders of their \"Los Favoritos,\" which included a taco, an enchilada, a tamale and a Chile relleno. They also came with rice. The beef taco and beef enchilada were exactly what I expected them to be. But I especially loved the chicken tamales and the Chile relleno. They are so full of flavors and delicious. The portion was generous and for $14.95, it was a steal. At Zazil in SF center, a chile relleno alone is $14. We also had the Tampique\u00f1o - a thin, marinated carne asada, topped with grilled green onions, and Fresh Mahi-Mahi en la Parilla - seasoned mahi-mahi with ground chive and cabbage slaw. Both dishes were delicious and memorable,\n\nOverall, I think it was a nice restaurant with great food in one of the best locations in the city at a very affordable price.

Overall, the place was nice because it was clean, predictable (no experimental  flavors or anything) Mexican food. No surprises but no disappointments either. \n\nThe sweet lady who took our orders and brought it to our table was more than nice, and at 8 months pregnant, no less.

Luckily I checked yelp and I found Tropisueno which is just steps from Market street. The ambiance of the place is classy but casual and the prices are extremely reasonable for what you're getting. The wait for a table here can be pretty long on busy nights so I decided to skip the line and eat at the bar. I got the chicken enchiladas and a house margarita (in addition to the complementary chips and salsa). I think you can tell a lot about a place by the chips and salsa and Tropisueno's chips were still glistening from the oil where they hand made them. The chips weren't greasy nor were they too thin or too thick. The salsa was probably the best I've ever had and they even gave a small selection of three other types of salsas which was a great touch. As I watched the bartender make drinks for others at the bar discussing origins of the different types of tequila and working with fresh orange zest and other garnishes I knew I was in good hands. Their house margarita turned out to be fantastic, a shining example of what a margarita should taste like. When the enchiladas in red sauce came they looked and tasted phenomenal. They give you a few choices for beans and it's served in a bowl on the side just so they could have enough room for your enchiladas and rice on the plate. The everything was seasoned perfectly and never before have I had melt in your mouth chicken like the chicken in these enchiladas.

I'm not sure what spices and seasonings go into it, but man, it was tasty. The pollo asada also comes with a side of veggies which were fine, but nothing amazing.\n\nThere were also great chips and salsa served beforehand.\n\nI will say that the service was not amazing. On the plus side I was warned of a 25-minute wait for the pollo asada, and when it turned out to be just about 10, I was pleased. On the downside, my waitress was mostly indifferent and not terribly friendly.\n\nIf you can deal with the service, then definitely go.", "author": "Paul M."}

The food is nice and clean (i.e. not too heavy or greasy. ). I loved the salsa and guacamole. I could have a meal on that alone. I also appreciated the fact that the portions weren't too big. and there cocktails are great! I had some drink that had honey in it.  It went down so smooth I felt that it would be a great thing to drink while sick. That is a good thing. They also have a drink with absinthe. Which may sound scary until you drink it. Then you realize that it is scary good.  \n\nThe only real reason that I am not giving this five stars is for its location. Unfortunately they are located in the small complex sits between Market and Mission. If my friend hadn't known that there was a restaurant that existed somewhere in the general vicinity I would have never gone.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-06", "description": "This review is mostly about the service that I experienced last week. \nOur waiter did not seem to know much about the menu. When I asked him how to describe one of their sparkling cocktails he literally leaned over my shoulder to read the menu description to me, instead of answering my question about the tequila to cava ratio. When I asked for a recommendation for dinner, giving him 3 things that I wanted, he chose something completely different than what I said I was interested in. (I mentioned the mahi-mahi, the chicken, or the carne asada. He suggested the shrimpl- seemed like he was trying to upsell me or would win a prize if people ordered the shrimp). Finally he suggested the chicken, so I ordered the Pollo Asado. I was never told it was a 1/2 of a chicken (like a rotisserie chicken, on the bones) and it does not say that it comes served this way on the menu. I never would have ordered this dish if I knew it came served like this (although my husband would have loved it, I do not). When I asked the waiter if the menu said it came served like this he said and gave an uncomfortable yes, and then just simply walked away. He did not bother to see if I liked it, he did not ask if we wanted more drinks, and he obviously did not read the menu, because it does NOT state that you will get a 1/2 of a chicken.  \n\"Pollo Asado plump, free range chicken marinated with citrus and achiote. grilled and served with sauteed zucchini, mushrooms, yellow squash, peppers and onion\"\n\nI believe this was misleading and not really acceptable to not inform the customer of what they are ordering.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-11-26", "description": "We decided to make the BART trip to Tropisue\u00f1o after they won Mission's Kitchen yearly mole competition, which was pretty much the limit of our knowledge about the place.  My first impression upon walking in the door was, \"Wow.  I clearly don't get out of the Mission enough for Mexican.\"  Far from a no-frills hole-in-the-wall, Tropisue\u00f1o is all big and nice.  Everything is painted in Mexican / Southwest motifs, and all the tables and chairs are nicely crafted and well-treated dark wood.\n\nWe probably arrived at around 8:30 on Friday evening, and sure enough, were quoted a 30-35 minute wait time for a table.  The bar, however, was nearly empty, so we opted for that.  (I mean, really; no waiting, equal access to food, and speedy access to booze and bartenders?  Why not sit at the bar, if there's only two of you?)  The friendly and attentive bartenders handed us a reasonably extensive menu of tequila cocktails right away, which was a pleasant surprise; we'd expected a reasonable selection of margaritas, but were extra intrigued by the variety and creativity of the list.  One side of the menu was devoted to variations on a classic margarita (ie, elderflower or ginger liquor in place of orange, or chili or vanilla flavored salt), and the other to other tequila-based cocktails.\n\nMy boyfriend started off with a classic margarita, which was pretty darn good, though not the best I've ever had.  I opted for a Santo, basically a margarita with St. Germaine elderflower liquor instead or orange liquor, and chili-flavored salt, also very tasty, though a little on the sweet side (he didn't like it as much as the classic).  Later, he ordered the ginger-flavored margarita, and when I couldn't decide what to try next, the bartender suggested a drink from the \"tequila cocktails\" list made with hibiscus-infused tequila and cucumber puree, which reminded me in some ways of things I've had at The Orbit Room.  I am not typically a huge fan of cucumber, but this absolutely worked; we both agreed that it was pretty fantastic and yummy.  Pretty much everything was in the $9-11 range (and I think there was one $12 drink), and worth it.\n\nAs with any Mesican establishment worth its salt (hah), chips and salsa were complimentary and quite tasty.  Don't know for sure, but I could believe the chips were homemade (still slightly hot with oil & with a fresh-tortilla-sort-of taste).  They brought a red tomato based salsa that was pretty good, and a green avocado-based one that was FABULOUS, though it could've done with just a bit more kick.  It was all I could do not to gorge myself on chips.  We also ordered the guacamole, which was also really delicious and fresh, if just a touch on the salty side.  It didn't look like much at first, but kicked our asses in the end; we were sad that we only managed to eat about half of it.\n\nBut understandable, all things considered.  I was drooling over half the things on the appetizer menu, but given my self-appointed status as benevolent empress-dictator in charge of SF ceviche quality control, I had to go with the ceviche, which was quite a generous portion for $6.  (Bonus points for the fact that it was tilapia & thus environmentally sound.)  REALLY good.  For entrees, I had the Chili Verde pork; the sauce had a fantastic, fresh green chili & black pepper flavor, with just the right amount of spice.  The pork itself was also of excellent quality: meaty chunks with not a lot of fat, but still tender enough to eat with a fork.  This was definitely one of the best parts of the meal.  My boyfriend had the Mole Poblano, which was sort of why we were there; he's definitely more of a mole eater than me, but I enjoyed the taste I had.  The chicken was good, and the mole sauce itself was thick and chocolaty, with a hint of smoke and a really nice cinnamon flavor.  Both entrees came with rice and beans, which were not amazing, but pretty good mixed in with the chili verde sauce.  About $100 even after tax and tip for two entrees, two appetizers, and four cocktails.\n\nThe atmosphere was laid back and fun; the bartenders were friendly and super-attentive, and the servers were absolutely on it the whole time we were there.  Not sure how often we'll get out here in the future given that it's a bart trip and a bit of walking, but it was definitely a fun and tasty evening.  Definitely recommend, even on a weekend evening. :-)", "author": "Angela B."}

Although, it took us over an hour to go the 2.5 miles to get here and finding parking is a nightmare. Best to park in the mall parking garage and walk as it's really not that far.   Still worth all that though. Walked in at 5:45 PM and waitress told us we had to be out of our table at 7:15 for someone who had a reservation but we were okay with that as we just wanted food.  They bring you 3 different salsas and two of them were good. Chips are nice and thin and were very warm. Ordered guacamole too and it was okay.  I had the Carnitas and they were very good! Not too fat and lots of flavor. Hubby had the Chicken with Mole and he said it was very good, flavorful and tender.  Two complaints - Diet Coke in a can - Seriously?

One picture had me on the phone calling for a reservation. We went on a Friday @ 6pm and the bar was packed but there were plenty of open tables. I do suggest if you plan on going anytime after 6, making a reservation because once we sat down it filled up really quickly.\n\nThe busboy brought us water, chips and salsa within 2 minutes of us sitting down! The chips and salsa were very good! They could have been a TAD less salty but the water is plentiful and quickly refilled throughout the meal. We ordered margaritas (The House Margarita & the Violeta). The Violeta was 50 cents more but had much more tequila than the house margarita. The margaritas were great! The portions were slightly smaller than other restaurants but it was hardly an issue.\n\nFor our main courses we order the chicken with mole and 2 chicken enchiladas! The enchiladas were good! There could have been a bit more flavor but they included a nice cheese on the top! As for the chicken mole, WOW! This is the BEST MOLE I have ever had. I am somewhat of a Mole Aficionado and I was thrilled with the mole @ Tropisueno. The portions are generous. We ordered black beans with our meal which were a little watery but good none-the-less.\n\nThe service was great! We were greeted immediately.

Four of us were attending the Gertrude Stein exhibit and gallery talk at the Contemporary Jewish Museum, and one of the party had the good sense to make dinner reservations beforehand at this eatery.\n\nWell.  I tell you.  I am now a convert.\n\nThe food was absolutely tremendous.  I cleaned every plate put before me.  I chose two appetizers: the platanos fritos and the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo.  Ssssccrrruummmppptious!  The chips that arrived before dinner, with a selection of three dipping sauces, were horribly addictive.  Be careful about ordering spicy dishes.  Some of them are ultra sultry ;-)\n\nI can't say enough about the Tres Leches cake.  Four of us shared two of them, and know what?  Next time I am getting a whole one to myself.  I don't usually eat cake of any kind--I'm more of a pie-and-cookie person--but this dessert rocked my world.  Incredible flavor.\n\nWe went on a Thursday at 6 PM; the place was jam packed to the gills; you felt an energetic, lively, slightly chaotic vibe the moment you stepped through the doors.  I strongly recommend reservations if you are coming for dinner.", "author": "Lizette W."}

Instead at Tropisueno they have you wait in line, order,pay for your food, then wait 10-15 minutes for your burrito to be ready. All the food and ingredients are in front a la Pancho Villa and even Chipotle. Their system is much faster and efficient. All in all it is a little pricey and their food is ok and their system sucks.

Read about Tropisueno and their fajita bar.  SOunded fab and their Yelps were good.  I called on Monday, assured someone would call me back but was asked to fax in my request \"so she'll be prepared.\"  Tuesday afternoon, no one has called back.  I call again.  Someone different answers and tells me \"we don't deliver.\"  Um, your website says you do and I've already spoken with someone about having it delivered.  She puts me on hold and I'm disconnected.    I call again the following day--third time now--and say that I'm getting nervous, the event is quite soon...no one's called me back.  I give them my personal cell since \"the manager can only call you back after 430\" when I'm off work.  No one calls me back.  I call them AGAIN, in the evening, when I'm assured a manager can talk with me.  And I am put on hold.  Forever.\nSo, to recap: four calls,  a fax listing our desires & willingness to pay with a credit card,  uninformed & uncaring staff.  Guess what?  We went with someone else.  The food may be great but I'll never know because the service was ridiuclously bad.  They are getting one star because Yelp won't let me give them NO stars.", "author": "julie a."}

This place is great for lunch, happy hour and dinner. The overall atmosphere is nice -- not too campy or cheesy, but just enough decor to keep it interesting. The vibe is generally pretty energetic, with most tables usually full. \n\nThe selection of salsas they bring you when you arrive are great. I hate going to places and eating the same boring salsa over and over until the meal arrives. Not only do they give you four, they give you four GOOD salsas. Just be careful, it's very easy to fill up on chips before the dinners make it. The dinner food is actually pretty unique. It takes Mexican food to the next level, with a little more intricate flavors and presentation. I normally opt for the traditional plate, which lets you choose a combination of 2 or three unique items (I'm pretty predictable and stick the the chicken taco and cheese enchilada.) I've tried other items on the menu and have been equally as satisfied. \n\n As other reviewers have noted, the service here sucks. Plain and simple. I've yet to have any sort of amazing experience with a wait staff -- tonight, for example, I ordered a second round of their \"Margaritas de la Casa\" (delicious, BTW...), and had to flag the waiter down after 20 minutes of waiting. It was busy, but it wasn't THAT busy....They can be pushy and start to clear drinks/glasses when they are still half full. They checked in three times on me asking if I was done when I still had a taco in my hand. Not the end of the world, but annoying no less. \n\nBut in looking at the quality of the food and drinks, it's hard to stay away from this place. It's conveniently located near Muni (and my work!), so I definitely see myself going back for more!", "author": "William d."}

Of course what do we do when we need to find a place?  Go on yelp.\n\nFor one, the staff was very accommodating to us (We joked that it was mostly due to the fact that my friend is a very attractive woman).  Getting there at 8:15 on a Friday night, with no reservation, they were telling us that it was going to be a 45 to 60 minute wait for a table.  Not wanting to wait that long, we asked if we could just sit at the bar.  While they said that was an option, they instead set up seats for us at a bar like center table which ended up working out for us.  On top of that, after we ordered, the host came by to tell us a table had become available and offered for us to move if we wished.  A nice consideration.\n\nThe food here was very good and pretty sizable portions.  I had the Chicken with Mole Poblano.  I found the rice and the chicken to be pretty tasty and there was so much that I still had half left to eat for drunken leftovers today.  I also had the chance to sample some of my friends' dishes and every one of them was delicious.  The margaritas were pretty good too, although I would've liked them to be a bit stronger, but then again I could just be greedy.\n\nI really liked the atmosphere this restaurant had too.

Or the Callos de Hacha a la Plancha (seared sea scallops on a plantain-chorizo hash with avacao tomatillo salsa). This was sooooo good! I admit, I wasn't sure what to think of a plantain and chorizo has, but it worked really well with the scallops. The plantains weren't sugary sweet (but plantains aren't) and the chorizo isn't too salty, so the two work well together, an in combination with the scallops - even better. Tony and I liked it so much, we used the awesome tortilla chips (perfectly light and not oily) to scoop up the rest of the hash. That was one clean plate. I was sad when the server took our plate away (even though there really wasn't anymore left). When I heard the server at the next table tell the folks he highly recommended the scallops, I kept saying \"they're damned good\" to Tony. Of course, this might be due to the house margarita (El Jimador Blanco, fresh lime juice and organic agave nector). That was a very good margarita, but very strong.  I couldn't finish it before I started to get sleepy and the busy Friday night crowd noise seemed to be amplified. Of course, I could have been getting a food coma from the Chicken with Mole Poblano (leg and thigh in a traditional sauce of dry chiles, spices, nuts, herbs and chocolate). The dish was huge! The tortillas they provided were super hot and fresh. There was a wonderful aroma of warm chocolate and spices. It was a very good mole sauce. Tony got the Tampiqueno (marinated carne asada topped with grilled green onions with an enchilada) - 1 huge piece of carne asada  (it was bigger than his two hands put together). I like my mole better. I wished the pork had a little bit more fat in it, because I think grilling it made the existing meat a little bit on the drier side.  We ended the nite with a coffee (to try to wake me up from the food coma and pleasant buzz) and this huge flan. The flan was an interesting texture, smooth and creamy at the top, drier at the bottom (you can tell where the water bath started and ended) - and it was a thicker and creamier texture than flan usually is. I felt like I was eating an egg flavored almost-cheese cake. It was delicious, just different. Tony's drink? A Michelala? (sp? - mix of Mexican beer and wine) - I didn't enjoy it that much. It tasted like flat beer. \n\nThe portions are big, the servers were friendly, they refilled the water quite frequently. A great find. PS - I agree with other yelpers., the red salsa definitely taste better. The green salsa is made with tomatillos, and a lot of lime juice. It was sort of an odd tangy flavor- not bad, not great-just odd.", "author": "Annie Y."}

Pulled up three random chairs and we made a mini table until a real one was open. Only took about 20 mins to get seated.\n\nThe margaritas were really good--we got the chili salt-rimmed ones. They have several different kinds of salt, which is great. And they were awesome. About $9 each, which is fair considering it isn't Dave's. \n\nThey served their chips & THREE kinds of salsa immediately. Absolutely delicious: the chips were clearly house-made, and the salsas...verde, a pico/red salsa mix & the most incredible orange-colored sauce. One negative is that they brought out guacamole which was amazing too--but apparently costs an additional $7 and we never requested it (thought it was free til we got the bill)...so minus a star for that--you should not serve ppl food that they didn't order if it's not free...seriously. \n\nI got an amazing chicken dish--perfectly seasoned & roasted, and still on the bone which I thought was interesting since it came with tortillas... My friends got the meatball soup, which she said was fabulous every time she got it--and really filling. We also got this appetizer that was named after cigars for their shape (name escapes me now)...they were vegetarian, fried and amazing (although, I do always commend a place for having non-fried vegetarian food--it IS possible, I swear). \n\nIt was pretty loud but was at capacity, so I can't be surprised.

Their house Margarita is my favorite standby, and I have recently ventured out into some of his other creations without the least bit of disappointment so far. I find now that I have to look at the drink menu again before I make a final decision.\n\nI have only had an opportunity to have dinner there on one occasion, and am extremely pleased with the service, food  quality, and proportions. I look forward to trying their lunch which is taqueria style with an open kitchen and roll-down menu that gets closed up and put away when the convert into sit-down dinner service.

I can't believe there are people that would give this place four stars. I was going to give this place 2 stars but the House Margarita's are to die for. The disappointments: the mole was too sweet, the rice was dry and had a weird sour taste. We asked for corn tortillas with our meal and were given two tortillas. One for each person. I don't know about you but 1 tortilla is not enough with Mexican or Latin American food. The positive: House Margarita's with agave, the beans, plantains and the salsa that comes with the chips. Side effect: My husband and I were extremely gassy after eating at this place. I know, TMI but someone has to let you all know.", "author": "Karla B."}

Any other restaurant would have a host welcoming you, especially if their door is open and obviously open for business. This place is only a sit down, actual restaurant style place starting at 5:30pm. Also you must have a reservation to eat here. Otherwise, be prepared to stand and eat as it is custom to do here apparently.... (really?!) Before 5:30pm, you can sit down at the bar, or small tables (but the rest of the restaurant is closed until it's open for dinner). There is very limited seating.

The food is so good and closer to authentic than most Mex places. When you walk in immediately see the menu which isn't one that has been pasted on the wall, it's a huge menu and big enough for many people to read together. The staff is very nice and you can see what they're putting in your plate while you're ordering. I had a veggie Torta and words can't describe how good it was. While my plate was being made I munched on chips and 3 different salsas from the salsa bar. The sangria I ordered from the bar was delicious but it was $8, although still worth the money.

At 8:30 our waiter told us that we would need to leave in 15 minutes because the next reservation had arrived. This made my friends and I extremely upset. When we spoke to the manager, he told us they typically allot 2 and a half hours for a dinner party. We told him we had barely made an hour.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-01-22", "description": "So I walk by this place occasionally and there is always a line. So today my friend and I decided to see what this place was really about. Honestly this was like the worst food I tasted in a long time.\n\nThe place is really nice so that is why I am giving it one star. The service was horrible at the cashier desk. I ordered three tacos and a drink ($1.75 for canned drink, like come on, I have ate at restaurants where the drink is $2.00, but they have refills). The Fish Tacos were 3.95 I think, but somehow the bill ran to 19.80, so does that mean the tax is almost $6 dollars?? And there was a sketchy receipt incident where I couldn't really get the total.\n\nWell the cashier in there (I will not identify the gender of this person because everyone has a bad day at work) with a low voice said the total was something but I couldn't hear them but it sounded like they said $9.80 (I should have been smart and thought 3.95 for three tacos is not 9.80 but I said maybe they said something else but definitely not 19.80, Man was I wrong). I checked to look at the cashier register total; it said 1.75 so I assumed that was for the canned drink. It never said the total. So they gave me .20 cents I think, I put it in my wallet carefully. Then I started to turn around and realized she hadn't given me back my whole change. So I turn around and say u didn't give me back my change. So they say \"Yea\" and point at the receipt that is right by their sided of the register. Then I realized maybe they gave it to and it is in my wallet. THE RECIEPT( my Stupidity) I thought it was there for some odd reason. So I walked off to my table. I have worked Retail before and they always teach u to hand the receipt to the customer rite, I am thinking it's the same for Food locations too. Or at least place the receipts right by customer side of the counter so they know it's theirs to keep. While at my table, I say I never got my receipt (late thought I know), actually my friend reminded. So I go back to ask for the receipt (I will say the place did get busy), the cashier takes a receipt out of the garbage and hands it to me (I am not hygienic freak so its whatever). BUT I look at the receipt walking back and it's not my receipt.(bad luck).\n\nAnyways I get my Three $20 worth of tacos, wow so good..NOT. The tacos didn't even come with any chips and it had way too much cabbage in it. Honestly I prefer to eat Mexican food ( not taco bell type) but this wasn't even good. I mean it was so plain, no taste at all. Honestly I have eaten at Chili's and Cheesecake Factory (American restaurants) and even their tacos are not that plain compared to these. I am not saying I am a Mexican food expert, but if any food is plain, I don't care how Mexican it is or it isn't, it sucks. Let's be honest, you can taste bad burritos and tacos but u can hope their salsa is good but not here, the salsa sucked. The fish tasted horrible and plain also. I also noticed that there were people that had chips and salsa and we didn't, and my friend said I think you have to ask for it. If that is the case, I am going to leave that assumption alone cause I hope not. Even taquerias in Hayward give chips and salsa. \n\nIn conclusion, the place was pretty crowded to my surprise. Maybe people know what to order I think. Fish Tacos is a no go. I would not come to this place just because there are way too many Mexican places that are better, I think I would really have walked numerous blocks to go to Gordos (which is ok food) then pay $20 for this meal.  If you like this place don't feel offended or think this is personal attack ok, it is just my experience and my opinion of it, so don't freak out Tropisueno lovers. But the service I experienced was horrible although the person that brought my food was really nice.", "author": "Syed J."}

My boyfriend ordered the Albondigas Guisadas -- a lighter dish but still filling.  I got the Tampique\u00f1o -- i like how my carne asada was juicy and tender, not dry at all unlike some places might cook their meat.

Once again, my awesome fellow Yelpers did not disappoint! We were in town for Wondercon and staying near Moscone. We were looking for a good Happy Hour and Tropisueno, aka Yelp Cafeteria to those in the know, was calling my name!!! \n\nWhat an awesome place. The vibe is mellow, the staff is friendly, the food is delicious, and the margaritas are strong. The menu states that each margarita contains 2 ounces of quality tequila...and oh they are not kidding. I watched the generous pour of El Jimador go into our many margaritas and experienced the warm, happy, and eventually fuzzy feeling that followed. The happy hour is the best deal going...get here early because the bar fills up fast! House margaritas are $5 as are well drinks. Tequila shots are $4 and cans of Tecate are $2. There is a large assortment of happy hour food at reasonable prices.\n\nMy partner in crime had the house margarita which comes rimmed with a deliciously spicy chili salt. It was crisp, smooth, and strong. The other signature margaritas on the menu were not included in the happy hour (regular price $9,) but they sounded so interesting I had to try a couple. I ordered a Violeta, which was a violet perfume explosion in my mouth. It comes in a glass rimmed with vanilla salt. I am not sure this is for everyone but I enjoyed it. For my second drink I ordered the Tropisueno, a margarita with ginger liquer, lemon juice, and a rim of rose infused salt and sugar. This was a delicious variation of a lemon drop and my favorite drink of the evening. Our fabulous bartender also made us a Bloody Maria which was awesome. His special touch was the juice of half and orange which brought out the bright sweetness of the tomato in the mixer. \n\nThe happy hour food menu had so many amazing and inexpensive choices but we had a couple more stops to make on our happy hour food crawl, so we just ordered the nachos. The chips were light and crispy and the beans were deliciously creamy. There was an abundance of gooey cheese and fresh guacamole. The portion was huge and only $5.\n\nWe enjoyed our happy hour experience so much we returned the next day for lunch. Lunch is taqueria style where you walk up, order your food, and find your own seat. I ordered a rajas tamale with mole poblano and a bean and cheese tostada. My partner in crime ordered a shredded beef burrito. The tamale was light and fluffy with nice strips of chile and just enough gooey cheese. The mole was nicely spiced and a really good match with the tamale. The tostada had a generous portion of the creamy and delicious refried beans. The gigantic foil-wrapped burrito weighed about 3 pounds and was generously filled with tender and flavorful beef. There is a salsa bar with an assortment of fresh and tasty salsas. I fell in love with the tomatillo salsa and couldn't stop eating it. By the end I was drinking it...no really, I was. I washed my meal down with a house margarita which was just as delicious as the one from night before. Lunch for two including my drink was $21 and we were full up to our eyeballs!\n\nGreat food, great service, great drinks, at great prices!!!

We called ahead and found out the wait was 45mins to an hour. Rather than go there and wait, we went on their website and made reservations for 8:45pm (it was 7pm at the time). When we got there, we were promptly seated. The place was crowded with people waiting even at 8:45pm. The drinks were delicious. We got a margarita and one of their tequila / bubbly wine drinks. Me and my girlfriend would definitely recommend the guacamole. Its a bit pricy but the portion was huge! Definitely enough for at least three to share. The chips were very crispy and delicious. By the time our entrees came out we were pretty much already full. The entree portions are big as well. I got their pork chop, which was think and juicy, and served on a bed of slaw and rice. My girlfriend got the tilapia. She said it was good. We both left very happy and full.

First of all it was a \"order here\" first then you sit down and they deliver the food to you.  I got my 2 tacos first before I received my shrimp with the red sauce.  The tacos were mostly flavorless and cold.  The meat was pretty tasteless compared to the taquerias in the Mission and the avocado and toppings were piled so high it was hard to eat.  Then the shrimp with the red sauce came out.  The shrimp were small and tough, tasted like they were frozen first, and it needed the sauce just so you wouldn't taste the shrimp.  I tasted the tamarindo drink and it was also watery and flavorless so I settled with the watermelon one which was just ok.  I wouldn't go back.

But seriously, it was a dark and stormy night, and it was late. I had just gotten done meeting Mark J. for a drink at Amber next door. I was mad fiendish for some food (and you know I love me some food!) Unfortunately, Amber was no longer serving food - boo! (Though, it was like super late on a Tuesday, so that's understandable).\n\nAs we trudge out through the rain, my stomach rumbling and Mark worrying if the thunder was quickly approaching, I console him and inform him that the noise is just my stomach.\n\nBut wait...what do we have here? \u00a1Tropisue\u00f1o! (Do you like how I got all fancy and Spanish there?) What luck! But wait...they are closing. We run to the door just as the owner, Erin, is turning the sign. But Erin (in case you did not know) is a sweetheart. She's the kind of sweet that would take in a box of stray kittens from a homeless woman at Wal-Mart. Just overflowing with sweet. So she takes pity on our pathetic and slightly wet souls and lets us in. (Though she had to rush to the kitchen to tell them that, even though she said that they could clean up, there was just one more customer...)\n\nSo from the very start I love this place. From there...it just keeps getting better (sorry for stealing the Christina Aguilera lyric...)\n\nSo back to Miss Erin. Aside from being utterly sweet, she's utterly devoted to this place. As an owner, she loves what she does and she loves her customers. How do I know? Because she told us. We were able to spend about 15 minutes talking with her and getting to know the \"lay of the land\" in regards to Tropisue\u00f1o. I've never had such a great time getting to know the owner of a restaurant before. Usually it's them talking about where they've worked, how fabulous they think they are...yada yada yada. Instead, she told us how excited and nervous she was for the restaurant to be starting. Mark and I both gave some suggestions, and even mentioned the Yelp part of ourselves, which she said she loved...because (to paraphrase) \"I want this restaurant to be for the locals. And Yelp is great for giving me feedback from the locals.\" Well Erin, this local loves what you're doing - keep it up my dear!\n\nManny (Manuel) the bartender makes the most delicious michelada - and seriously, I've had some good ones before. But his rocked. There's something about the secret recipe salt that he uses, with just a hint of lime and pepper...my lips weren't burning, my stomach wasn't hurting...it was D-double-LICIOUS! \n\n\nIn regards to food...I ordered Tropisue\u00f1o with the white beans. So f-ing good. Like not even playing. It all blended so perfectly together in my mouth that I thought I was having a food orgasm. Hell, I might have...who knows? And the white beans...yes, they are definitely one of their specialties. As Mark said, it does have a slight sweet taste to them. Though it's a natural sweet taste. But to me it taste like barley or oats.\n\nOverall, Tropisue\u00f1o definitely deserves it 5 star rating and if I could give it more then I would. Even if they are in the thick of \"downtown tourist\" central, they are made and cater to us local folks. With an exceptionally delicious menu of amazing and authentic quality food, backed up with the outstanding service from the employees and the owner...you have to try this place out. And while I might be a bit sad if I come back here and this place is swamped busy from such great reviews, I know that waiting around will be totally worth it.", "author": "Nicolas H."}

The bartender seemed extremely competent and everyone was friendly.  For a light dinner I had the appetizer tacos al pastor (grilled pork with pineapple, cilantro, onion & salsa) - it was quite tasty although needed a pinch of salt and maybe a pinch more pineapple. Tried their tres-leches cake too it was probably the second-best I've ever had (first best being my husband's cinco-leche cake with toasted coconut on top).  The guys next to me at the bar ordered regular meals that looked alright but, like other reviews say, sans vegetation.

That pretty much sums up how awesome it is. They also have tarot card imagery on all their stuff, which to me has some odd associations with my crazy Latino mother, but I didn't seem to mind. Overall, the d\u00e9cor manages to capture a certain Mexican flair without being cheesy like many places going for that look. \n\nThe food is quite fresh and tasty. They have two different types of vegan burritos. One involves some sort of marinated tofu and the other is grilled veggie. I believe you can get these in other forms like tacos and tostadas, but don't hold me to it. The tofu burrito was pretty good. The tofu didn't have much flavor. I kind of feel like Latinos don't know what to do with tofu sometimes and kind of freak out and just throw it in a burrito tasting all bland and sad, and then everyone is sad. The grilled veggie, though less exciting, is much better. The veggies are all grilldy and zesty and make it nice and flavorful. \n\nThey also have a salsa bar! I cannot understate the importance of a salsa bar. I hate it when you have to ask for extra salsa, so that you can pour it on your burrito! For a bite composer like me (I'm a nut case that likes to create the perfect balanced bite every time), side salsa is a must (I'm talking to you Chipotle!). Anyway, the guac is pretty good, though nothing to write home about. What I would post a serious letter to someone about are the Margaritas. They make them fresh with agave nectar! They are really quite delicious and not cloyingly sweet like many, and that's just their basic margarita. You don't even have to order top shelf for that. [By the way, I love how all the foodies have discovered that agave rocks everyone socks, and they're including it in all sorts of foodie drinks and stuff and acting like they just discovered it!

Food was delicious, homemade and super fresh, drinks were amazing with service to match!  We had Paco the first night and he was awesome - great service and loved all his recommendations.  I usually don't even like margaritas on the rocks, but they don't have blenders but he assured me I would like it.  He was right!  Another one of his recommendations was the Pepino - a cucumber margarita that was out of this world!  We had our kids with us so he explained that they didn't have a kids menu, but could pretty much make them anything.  So, while this isn't a kids place, it was definitely very family friendly.  He basically made them plain chicken tacos and a chicken quesadilla, which, was probably the BEST quesadilla I have ever tasted.  So, our kids were happy and we were happy too, because we didn't have to settle for substandard food/drinks/environment that usually come with a family friendly establishment.  To top it all off, it was AFFORDABLE!  This place is an absolute FIND in the middle of a high tourist area where you would expect prices to be inflated.  My husband came in the second night we were there and I knew he would love it, so we had to go again.  Our experience was equally fantastic!  We loved the Pepino margaritas so much our waiter (different the second night) even gave us the recipe, after we asked.  He even told us if we wanted to buy another, we could go up to the bar and watch the bartender make it for us, so we could see exactly how to make it.  We really appreciated this - the bartender, a very sweet and friendly gal, explained the steps to us.  Everyone really went out of their way to provide service at a level you normally just don't see, but you could tell this is just the way they do things.

I'm not a big mexican food fan which is why I have a hard time giving this place 5 stars - though it should be noted that if they can please a non-mexican food lover then they're doing pretty good!. I called ahead and told them it was the bf's birthday and they said they could bring out a dessert and sing.\nInstead, since we ended up ordering dessert, they brought out a nice shot of tequila in a champagne glass with a salted/seasoned lime. very classy! and the song they sang was nice and not corny. My bf is not one for making a scene but he enjoyed it.\nA+ to them for making it a special birthday.\nThe food was pretty good too. We had the scallops with chorizo for starters which were very nice. I ordered the stuffed chilli, quite nice, and the bf ordered a shrimp dish which was too spicy for me but he really enjoyed it.\nWe each had a margarita. I love that they sweeten them with agave syrup! Nice touch.\nWe will definitely come back next time my boyfriend insists on mexican food. If the experience is just as good the next time around I might consider upping this to a 5 star rating.\nGo check it out!", "author": "Sandra E."}

The first time I went to Trop it was for lunch, and I was blown away at the quality to price ratio for two street tacos.  Since then, I feel like the tacos keep getting smaller, the servers a little sloppier and the prices a little less bearable.  \n\nThe deathblow for me came right before Christmas when I was at happy hour with a friend of mine, we were having a good enough time drinking margaritas and eating chips and salsa, that is until the bill came--12 margaritas for $72 dollars.  Wow! Now that is an expensive happy hour for two people, not to mention the fact that I DIDN'T drink 6 margaritas.  As most people comment, the drinks are stiff, and personally I don't have a tolerance of a professional binge drinker.  One could therefore reason that with 6 margaritas I would be in a pool of my own vomit when the bill came. I informed the waiter of this discrepancy, that in fact I could have not consumed more than 4 margaritas, but as I am a reasonable person I will pay for 5 since I believe it was a misunderstanding.  Long story short, he told his manager/owner(?), who then informed me that if he SAID we had 12 margaritas then I would be paying for 12 margaritas.  So we did, and despite the fact that the service was outstanding (on that occasion), I left no tip and will not return for another drink.  \n\nNothing like this has ever happened to me when dining out, so it never occurred to me that I should be responsible for keeping a running tally of drinks in case they try to slip a few extra in there. Consider yourself warned happy hour isn't a very good deal if you have to pay for 4 drinks you never consumed.", "author": "Brian F."}

I remember the food being very good, but we were frankly in a mad rush to catch a movie so my friend and I couldn't really get the feel for the place. \n\nRound 2 on Saturday night with another friend. This time we came for drinks before seeing a rock show downtown. I like the fact that they take pride in the quality of their cocktail ingredients. All the tequila are top notch. No Cuervo or Patron in sight. Only the finest Jalisco has to offer. And they use agave nectar rather than simple syrup which makes the drinks even better. But the bar service, this is where they really earned the 5th star! Manuel and his bar staff, Luca and Gonzalo rounded out the experience for us. I even got an adhoc Tequila education from Manuel who was very busy that night. They are just terribly nice folks who want to make sure their patrons are happy and taken care of. I will come back here again and again. It's unpretentious and warm and the atmosphere makes me feel like I'm in Mexico all over again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-04-08", "description": "This is one of the worst Mexican restaurants in town. To start the food is priced too high for the amount of food you get. The food here is disgusting. I had taco de carne asada and the meat tasted old like it wasn't clean or has been sitting there for a while. Of course I never give up on a place after one try, so I ordered the tamales. The  tamales here were mediocre and not very impressive. They used cumin in this dish which is not a  traditional Mexican spice and actually shadowed the other flavors in the the tamal. The rice was disgusting it did not taste authentic and again had that over powering taste of cumin. My friend had the mole and according to her it was not good at all and also said it did not taste authentic. The only authentic Mexican thing at this restaurant is the servers and other wait staff. The only thing that is worth going here for is the margaritas and chip during happy hour other then that I will never return or recommend any one going here. Now for the actual venue.The lighting in this restaurant is so dark that it is almost impossible to read the menu or use the bathroom. I also think the bathroom in the front are  the only bathrooms in the restaurant because you constantly see servers and chefs using this bathroom, and to top it I dont think I sen the sign stating it's law for restaurant workers to wash Tere hands before going back to work.  So if your looking for an over priced un-authentic Mexican restaurant where there is hardly any room to sit then Tropisueno is your place.", "author": "Rafael M."}

The PLAINTAINS are what make it for me. YEAH Plaintains! Also good fresh light salty homemade tortilla chips, a must for good Mexican in my book.\nDECOR: Cute Mexican style, pleasant atmosphere, but often very crowded.\nSERVICE: OK but too slow during busy times. They don't go out of their way to accommodate special menu requests. \n\nHere's my story:\nThe first time we went here I'll admit I was in a PISSY mood. Don't ask me to explain myself; I just was. When we got there on Friday evening, it was packed as all hell and we were told we could camp out at the bar area or wait 90 minutes. I needed a bevvie, stat. It took about 25 minutes to get one, only after I very nearly pulled out MEGGA BIATCH to get one from the bartender. I was hot, thirsty, and why was this place so goddamned bright? I was also getting crap from the waiter for wanting a quesadilla when we were there after lunch & happy hour, and though they made them then, suddenly, miraculously, these ingredients seem to just disappear from the kitchen after 7pm. I settled on plantains, guac, and booze. Luckily, the ritas came eventually and that makes everything better. The night got progressively better after that. The plaintains were AWESOME. I love that they even have them on the menu- why doesn't everywhere?! \n\nTo top it off, they give you CHUBBA CHUBS instead of mints. Hellloooooo these are the best lollipops ever. I highly recommend the icecream-flavored one. I nearly peed myself when they came out. Um, I think that was after 2 or 3 margaritas. But I was ready to award many a star after that, let me tell you. \n\nAnd, even better, on our way home we stopped in a little convenience store on 4th street across from Yerba Beuna Gardens. After some drunken conversation with the guy behind the counter (involving tequila, and why the jelly bean container I was holding should only cost 1.99 instead of 5.99), just as my friends and I were about to leave, I was awarded a FREE thing of jelly beans. And I am not a give away free-things-to cute kind of girl, so let me tell you, after the whole Chubba-chubs excitement, I was ready to dance in the streets with my free jelly beans. Sweeeeeet. It's the simple things, really. \n\nThe second time we went it actually was happy hour, so quesadillas were allowed. Pretty good but nothing amazing. We were instructed we could stay at a table only until 7pm; as the hour neared we kept getting looks from the waitstaff to get up and go. We didn't even get our lollipops. I snuck an extra Chubba-chups on the way out, just 'cause. Been back a number of times for drinks- the ritas always keep me happy.", "author": "Kristen L."}

When I spoke to the host about it, he wasn't rude at all, despite the fact that they were absolutely packed. We only had to wait a few minutes and they were kind enough to accommodate all 5 of us. The margaritas were decent; I think my friends liked theirs more than I liked mine. The guacamole is awful here, but everything else was very good. The Tampiqueno, which my friend got, is like an entire cow on a plate. Seriously, two or more people can share that dish. I had the scallop and chorizo appetizer and it was delicious, especially considering how easy it is to ruin scallops. They provide free salsas, chips, beans and tortillas for the table, which is very generous. Our waiter was friendly and helpful, but had some Nazi-like person (manager??) shadowing his every move. She barely smiled, and didn't seem too friendly, and I just thought that seemed kind of strange. We had no problems with our service at all.

Wondering around Yerba Buena Lane, we stumbled onto Tropisuena. Never heard of the place... looked Mexican... I'm not a fan of Mexican food, but the place smelled good, looked great, and the menu was very interesting.\nAfter the show - good show: Andy Warhol: Good for the Jews? - we went back and were seated at a table for two in the window. The place was about half full and the waiter came right over for our drink order. Drinks in hand, we were given time to peruse the menu, and a fine menu it was, fairly traditional, straightforward and simply prepared Mexican food. We ordered Guacamole to start. My wife had the Combo Special - black beans, rice, a beef enchilada and a chicken enchilada. I ordered Albondiags - meatballs in a chili broth with chunks of carrots and potato, yellow rice and white beans on the side. The table was hardly big enough to hold all the plates. It all went well with a XX Lager draft.\nEverything was perfect. The enchiladas were tasty and moist and NOT smothered in cheese, as they so often are. The Guacamole was chunky and spicy. My Albondiags were served in a bowl, swimming in a very spicy, but not disagreeable chili broth. The warm, white beans were creamy in the mouth, and the perfect coolant after the spicy broth.\nAll in all, great! The servers were attentive, friendly and not pushy. I'll be back.

The inside is nice, and once seated they give you a basket of hot chips with a trio of salsas.  So it starts off really well, but then... we ordered drinks and dinner and it just started to go down hill.  They have different margaritas which is good except it took an awfully long time to get them and once they arrived one of them was the wrong kind.  Mistakes happen at all restaurants and it was kind of loud so it's not really an issue, but an apology wouldn't have hurt either.  When we ordered dinner one person was having a tough time ordering so they asked the waiter for their recommendation after handing in their menu.  This was a mistake.  The waiter recommended the mole, the person ordering said, ' it's chicken breast, right?'  The waiter replied, 'yes and it's very good.'  The meals came and the mole was chicken legs not chicken breast.  The issue was mentioned to the waiter and he said, 'no, its chicken leg and thigh.'  Again, it was loud, and the mole looked good so we overlooked it.  Next came the chile verde and this one was definitely a strike out.  Rather than coming as the described succulent pieces of meat, we received a blob of meat that fell apart easily and was at least 50% fat.  The bits of meat were fine, but what restaurant serves a chunk of fat?  Yuck.  We pulled off the meat and left a giant pile of fat.  We would have mentioned this to our waiter during dinner but he never came by to ask if everything was alright.  When he finally came we told him everything was good but the chile verde was a disappointment and pointed out the giant pile of fat left over.  He thanked us for letting him know and said he was going to take it to the chef.  Later he brought us our bill and never mentioned the chile verde again.  Really?  That's the best they could do?  It's not terribly surprising but it is disappointing.  Once again an apology wouldn't have hurt and an offer for a free drink or a dessert would have made us happy.  Oh well.", "author": "Cantik E."}

Cons:  service was so rushed it was unbelievable (like a SNL skit), most of the food was chevy's quality (ie. not good), and the drinks were inconsistent (see above).  I wouldn't go back for dinner.  Maybe lunch is better?", "author": "Michael W."}

The prices are really reasonable, portions are more than generous, and the food is damn good. I love the mini salsa bar they give you at the beginning with a mountain of chips. If you're a Gringa in disguise like me, cuidado! The salsa is on the spicier side. My husband really likes spicy food and his nose ran, but he loved it. Fortunately the avocado salsa is more mild and they give you some white-girl salsa on the side so everyone gets to snack. Some horchata would have been a godsend, unfortunately it's not on the menu. I opted for a Mexican coke instead.  I highly recommend the plantains with black beans to start, and the Chile Verde. It has a hint of all spice, so expect more of a green mole flavor. I really enjoyed it and the pork was cooked perfectly--big cubes of moist, cut with a fork meat. \nThe service was very friendly and prompt, but not rushed at all. The decor is really cozy and warm. Noise level is a bit loud, but not distracting. Maybe not the best place to take your hard of hearing grandparents or a soft spoken date. Perfect place to go after a movie with a group of friends or for happy hour.", "author": "Nitalia P."}

We didn't have a reservation, but got seated almost right away for 8pm dinner for two.  Started with House Margaritas ($8).  Really good flavor, cute glasses, salt, on the rocks.  I should have had two, but instead tried the Pale Ale, which was ok.  For dinner, my Husband had chicken mole, which he loved.  I had a vegetarian soup with spicy tomato broth, vegetables and hominy!  Extremely filling, and goes well with beer.  The wait staff was really polite and friendly.  They didn't rush us out.  Several people had birthday dinners that night, and the staff came out and sang for them.", "author": "Erin C."}

I thought i read somewhere in fine print that they use 2 ounces of tequila. It was good but too strong for me. I drank a third of it and passed it on to chris.\nThey chips were warm, thin and crispy. It was served with what looked like a roasted red tomato salsa. It reminded me of the chevy's salsa but better. The other salsa was creamy, it tasted like there was avocado in it. I ordered the shrimp cocktail. It was different but good. I ordered the camarones tropisueno. It was delicious and spicy. It was served with mexican rice, a trio of beans served family style and warm corn tortillas.\nChris had the grilled pork chops. It was tender, juicy and very tasty. I had a few bites of that. I ordered the Tres Leche cake which was good but not as moist I had hoped. The Tres leche cake from Safeway still wins. The service was good and the bathroom was clean.", "author": "Joie G."}

We came in just as it was filling up, but only had to wait a few minutes.  The place looked cute, with little pyramids on the benches separating the tables, and weird containers of stones on the tables themselves. Starting out, for drinks, the only drinks they offer are alcoholic - no agua frescas or juice or anything like that, yes we asked and they even told us that. We stuck with water, and got a nice pitcher of water left on the table (yay). They also give you nachos with four different salsas. We were both hungry, and filled up on those, which were the best part of the meal. J didn't see anything he really liked on the menu, which almost never happens, as he really loves food. He ended up getting the enchiladas, which were not featured, but squished at the top corner. Most of the items sounded fancy, but then when you saw what they were, you realized they were fairly boring. Meat with veggies and side.  And, it's not like we have not been to non-tacos/enchiladas type mexican places before..we usually like them.  I tried a seafood soup.  We started out with plantains, which were the second best part of the meal. Not the best ones ive had, but good. They came atop some beans. By the time the entrees came, we were both pretty full. J's meal tasted basic. My soup was GIGANTIC and I ate the seafood pieces out of it, but the broth was bland. It seemed like a dish I've had at italian places, but without the flavor. They bring you a thing full of tortillas and beans, and mine came with rice, so I filled up mostly on the rice and beans, which were good. I was not impressed with my soup at all. As I said, we had a coupon off, but it still cost more than I would have paid for the tastiness of the food. So, it wasn't bad, but the \"meh, I've experienced better\" two stars probably aptly describes this place, after a discussion between J and I. The d\u00e9cor was nice though, and the location convenient, and the bathroom was ok, but I had to use the men's room, as there was a girl holed up in there who wouldn't (couldn't?) come out lol. I'd say, check it out and see what you think, you might like it. I don't think I'd go back.", "author": "Merredith L."}

Upon entering we saw some people at the bar and the dining area was mostly empty with just a few patrons. The table where we were seated was small. It was hard fitting everything on the table when our orders came. \n\nThe service was very good. Upon seating we were going to order ice tea but they didn't offer that. So the waiter offered us a Jamaica (hibiscus flower) juice drink. He brought a sample for us to taste. It was good and he said that it was good for clearing out the toxins from the liver. After we place our orders, the server brought us some delicious fresh chips with a guacamole dip and salsa. I had salmon, rice and vegetables. My companion got the mole with chicken which was appealing at first because the sauce contains chocolate. The sauce was good but the chicken was very dry. It was like eating chicken jerky. I was happy with my salmon but wished there was a more flavor. Along with our entrees they brought a side of refried beans and tortilla wraps. I made myself a wrap and was filled to the brim with food. We decided to go for the dessert. They only have one - a chocolate fondue with slices of mango, strawberries, and banana. The dessert was disappointing. They brought the fondue out and the chocolate started burning after awhile but the actual temperature of the chocolate was lukewarm. I think they used dark chocolate which is a plus. \n\nOverall, the server was very nice. He kept coming over to check on us. He tried to explain what things were on the menu.

But regardless, it was a great meal. Relatively well priced, especially in downtown San Francisco. However, guacamole was almost the price of an entree.\nThe food was very tasty - kind of soul Mexican food. This isn't a burrito/quesadilla place - it's a more authentic, comfort food. The portions were great for the price as well. \nWe also had a tres leche desert cake - wow, one of the best deserts I've ever had, worth every penny and more.\nCheck it out, it's worth the stop.", "author": "Austin S."}

The food was over salted with that chalky iodized salt.  I had the combo carne asada and chicken enchilada. The meat was a very small portion, dry and salty.  The enchilada lacked cheese and also heavy with the salt.  Even the beans on the side were salty.  It was if the cook had an accidental spill of salt. I had to drink so much water.  I tried a piece of my friend's salmon and that was fine.  I hate to say it but its on the par to Chevy's.  It is  aesthetically pleasing and the service was descent.  I think at the very least its okay for an afterwork margarita.", "author": "Food F."}

There are simply no good burrito places within walking distance of my place. We ate here and thought the food was decent, but there were some problems. For one, it seems like they still have to figure out a logical flow for the place. The ordering, getting utensils, and getting salsa was a little confusing. Also, the food was overpriced. The burritos are especially expensive at a whopping $9 for something you could get for $4 elsewhere. Yes, the place has some atmosphere, but for these prices the food should have something special going on too.", "author": "Michelle A."}

The first thing I would like to compliment them on is the service, we had 2 people waiting on us the entire meal, never had to ask for drink re-fills, kept bringing us chips and salsa, the salsa was so yummy when i mentioned this to the waiter he brought us a larger bowl of salsa, they even gave me the recipe.  My hubby and I ordered the cucumber margarita recommended by the waitress and it was a great choice.  The food was also delicious, I ordered the mushroom empanadas and told the waitress I would love a salad but did not see one on the menu, she brought me a very generous side salad with avacados, my hubby also loved his meal.

It's too bad I don't live in San Francisco, because otherwise I would go here all the time. I live in Southern California, so you would think I'd be able to find a better Mexican restaurant here, but Tropisue\u00f1o is the best!\n\nStarting off with the chips and salsa, the chips are fresh and there are two types of salsa: one green one and one red one. The green salsa was good, but the red salsa was awesome! You could tell it was homemade, and it tasted better than any salsa I've ever had. For drinks, my boyfriend and I got horchata and this too was no store-bought horchata. It's not like the sugar-filled drinks you'll buy from a store or get at other restaurants. This was sweet, but not too sweet. It was also kind of thick. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it is good and should be tried.\n\nAs for dinner, my boyfriend ordered the mole and I ordered two tamales and an echilada. The enchilada was very good as were the tamales. My boyfriend really enjoyed his mole as well. For dessert, they only had one option. It's melted chocolate served with cinnamon tortilla chips and assorted fruit. Unfortunately, this wasn't on the menu, so I will just tell you now that it's $10, which might be a little too much, but it was good. However, if the owners are reading this, pineapple dipped in chocolate is odd. Bananas would work better.\n\nOverall, I'd give the food 4 stars. Yes, it is very good, and definitely on par with the best Mexican food I've had, but I have recently tried 5-star food and Tropisue\u00f1o just isn't quite there. Why do I give it 5 stars then? Because of the 6-star service. One of the ways I rate a restaurant is how often they refill my water (I drink a lot), and they not only leave you with a small bottle with extra water, but the bus boy comes over to refill your glasses for you! The waitress was also very nice. For those who don't like too much service, you may feel a bit smothered, but I was very happy with the service.\n\nGood food, excellent service.

Coming from San Diego we were in search of a good, reasonably priced Mexican joint that wasn't a chain.  Thank goodness for Tropisueno!  \n\nFirst Impression:  We went there when it first opened up [before they had their liquor license] and were kindly greeted with a smile.  That hasn't faded the whole time they've been open. \n\nD\u00e9cor:   This place is nicely decorated.  It feels authentically chic and the mood lighting helps you unwind after work or when you're just strolling around the 'hood.\n\nAmbiance:  Chill - great for socializing and hanging out!\n\nFood:  The complimentary chips and salsa - can't go wrong.  Guacamole - delish.  Carnitas?!  - YUM!  The flavor of everything is great but could use some toning down of salt.\n\nHappy Hour:  The margaritas are strong and the spiced salt on the rims give it an extra kick.  Yummy!    The only complaint is their hH is too short.  Only until 6 PM?!  We'd give it another star if they bumped it an extra hour.  \n\nPrice:  Lunch, happy hour, or dinner their prices are well priced for the tasty food, especially compared to other places in the city. \n\nService:  Depending on how busy it is the service can be a bit slow, but they are super attentive to what you want.  We've always had them asking if there was anything else we needed.\n\nConclusion:  The food and prices are comparable to that of San Diego.   The authentic flare is there and so is the kindness of the people working there.  No need to look for another place to get street tacos.  Bon Appetite!", "author": "M and S."}

I got chicken and carnitas tacos, served simple with onions, pico de gallo, and cilantro. Both meats were tender and free of fat, and I could easily dress up the flavor (though flavorful enough on their own) with one of the many delicious salsas they offer for FREE at their salsa bar. Broiled serrano peppers are also offered at their salsa bar, making for a nice free little appetizer if you aren't feeling the chips your meal comes with (as others have said, they aren't anything special).

We like to sit at the bar when we go out to a casual meal but the head bar tender seems ruins my experience at this restaurant each and every time. He's unfriendly (even though he knows our faces), he's lazy, he's forgetful (last time we dined he forgot to place our order), he's unapologetic and he's always one step behind what we need -- a fork, a glass of water, another drink, more chips, etc. This place would get 5 stars if he got canned.", "author": "Alexis L."}

The ceviche was tasty but not amazing, the chile verde was awesome and tender, the margaritas were made with El Jimador and left us thoroughly anesthitized!", "author": "Madelena M."}

For fellow out-of-towners: they are EXTREMELY hard to find, solely based on their address. They're actually located INSIDE the yerba Buena center...Yerba Buena isn't actually a street. It was a bitch trying to find it using my tom tom! So I'm taking a star off. They're set up like a fancy chipotle, as you stand in a line and watch them add the beans, rice, meat etc on your plate. If you get something that requires a little more handling, they'll give you a number and bring it to you. At first it was a little confusing, so we had to stand back and watch a few folks go thru the line to get it lol. The food was more than enough...they had BIG servings, the chips and guac were good and they made a strawberry margarita with real strawberries. All around good experience.", "author": "vanessa m."}

We were greeted by one of the owners who was gracious and professional. The place was full so I recommend reservations unless you enjoy having a drink at a busy bar area while you wait to be seated. The atmosphere was fun and welcoming by the entire staff. The scallop app was terrific. I recommend for two. Since this was our first visit we ordered standards for a  Mexican/Latin American restaurant. We both had the version of combination plate which included taco, enchilada, tamale. Each dish included rice, choice of beans, and hot tortillas. We were impressed with the quality and quantity. If we ordered this dish again, we would just pick two items for the combo. Service was stellar and the owner stopped by to confirm we were happy with the meal. She appeared to be very experienced in the restaurant business. We will be back to test the \"Happy Hour\" special menu, beers, margaritas, and other dishes for dinner. We encourage everyone to stop by and have some fun!", "author": "Gerry C."}

The food is good and the prices are pretty reasonable.  The service is a bit on the slow side, though not that big a deal.  But it gets 3 stars instead of 4 because it's not as good as Mexico DF.", "author": "Tom S."}

But the Appetizers are really a waste of money.\nWe got two little tacos like with no flavor and tons of sour cream. And that was 8 dlls!! Considering you can get a decent burrito full of flavor anywhere else in the city i thougt this was a total rip off.\nAlso when we got our plates all above the 15dlls range, they only got us 3 little cups of beans and one basket of tortillas for a group of 8???\nOf course they promptly added the 18%  for a large party and charged 2 extra margaritas! They corrected that mistake but i remember they did the same thing when we were there for happy hour.\nOvercharging guys who drink a little bit is not a good thing.\nI will be drinking my margaritas somewhere else!\nI dare to say Chevy's... i rather go drink there!\nSmall drinks, is not a trade of for a view!", "author": "Jose A.

Make sure to get there early because happy hour an get pretty crowded. I mostly eat at lunch because it's quick on the cheap and very tasty.  They allow me to sub chorizo on my taco so they can do no wrong in my book.  Salsa bar selection is top notch and the chips are homemade and best in town!", "author": "elizabeth s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-21", "description": "We had lunch there today and they were not too busy which I now understand why.  My wife's chicken mole was tasty but everything else was pretty average. All items from entr\u00e9es to rice and salsa were just way too salty!  My al pastor burrito was nearly inedible because of the salt. I guess they are hoping everyone will order more drinks?  The chips.... according to other yelpers - the chips are made there?  Doubt it, and if they were making them then that would be another knock - I've had way better chips elsewhere - lots of places actually.  Can you write about service in a place where you order at the counter as you come in and they bring the food out the match the number?  The food did come out fast but the man didn't bring water or utensils.   So its mostly self serve. I don't get the other yelpers that write about such great service - have you really eaten here?  Lastly whats up with the picture of bullfighters in the bathroom - I thought this was a mexican place not a spanish place?   Anyhow, with so many great places to eat in SF  I don't think I'll be going back for seconds.", "author": "Eric H."}
