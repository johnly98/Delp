They automatically charged for tip but when paying with credit card they didn't provide the original bill afterwards so it's easy to overlook the fact that they had already charged you ... so you end up paying them double for tip. The gratuity font is also super tiny right above the total not next to tax so there's no doubt that they're doing this on purpose. Service was also not great, they came by once to get our order and another to deliver the food. Then later on just casually slipped the bill onto our table without a word.  \n\nDuck fried rice was great. Curry was too sweet and Tom yum soup was too salty. FYI curry doesn't come with rice and is an extra $2 charge. Would not come back here again because of the way they operate.", "author": "Ashley W."}

And with that being said...\n\nThis is definitely not a 5-star place, although it is good.  The interior is part calming (good), part funky (not so good).  Chicken Satay was fine, peanut sauce great but chicken could have been cut and cooked a bit better.  Tom Kha Khai soup was creamy, and tofu inside was not fried but nice and soft, which is good, but just not the ultimate flavor-wise.  \n\nI'm a huge fan of Massaman (or Mussamun) Curry, a special Southern Thai dish which, if done right, is cooked for 24 hours and uses stew beef chunks.  They have this curry here, which initially drew me in, but it's not the beef stew kind, just one of their several curries that you choose a meat to go with, which is not traditional.  So I knew this wouldn't be my regular fave, but I decided to try it.  Unfortunately, it was just 'ok.'   Definitely not the Massaman I'm used to.  Hard to even describe the flavor -- peanut mixed with some other spice I can't put my finger on.\n\nYah, I'm definitely a bit picky, the food here is fine.  You'll have a decent meal.  But, for me, it doesn't come close to my go-to, Chili Cha Cha 2 in the Mission.", "author": "Merrick W."}

Since they don't take reservations, it was a 45 minute wait at around 8:00 pm. So, we opted for Sriracha his favorite Thai restaurant in the Inner Sunset area and were seated immediately as it was only half full.\n \nMy sister, who frequents Sirarcha, suggested some of her favorite dishes.  Needing another item, I was tasked with selecting an entr\u00e9e.  Our dishes:\n \nPad Se-Ew Shrimp - stirred fried rice noodle with shrimp and sweet soy sauce., Chinese broccoli, broccoli, carrot and egg.  Tasty with a slightly sweet flavor.\n \nPineapple fried rice with prawns, pineapple, egg, raisin, pea-carrot, onion and cashews. Rice had a good texture and dish had four good size prawns. \n \nSriracha fried rice with egg, chili, hot basil, onion, topped with grilled prawns and fried egg.  This dish was flavorful, but it does have a kick to it, especially to those that have a light tolerance to spice.\n \nKanah moo krob - stir fried roasted pork belly with Chinese broccoli, spicy chili garlic and black bean\nSauce - More of a Chinese stir fried dish with Chinese roast pork. Good, but didn't seem like a Thai dish.  Also, black bean sauce was light in black beans.\n \nGrilled chicken with Thai herbs, with sweet and sauce and fresh green salad.  My order, which my sister has not tried. It was grilled chicken breast that was a little on the dry side.  Probably my least favorite of our dishes.\n \nFried banana with coconut ice cream. Two egg rolls filled with bananas and a scoop of coconut ice cream.  Creamy ice cream, but I have had better deep-fried bananas.\n \nFresh mango with sweet sticky rice - first time trying this dessert. It consisted of slices of fresh mango with a large scoop of sweet rice.\n \nOverall, very good Thai cuisine in good size portions with efficient friendly service. Nice option for Thai in the Inner Sunset.", "author": "Al L."}

It drew me in like the pied piper.\n\nI ordered the Pad Kee Mao with chicken for only $8.95.  The flavors blended perfectly and the chicken, while very lean and only white meat, could have turned out way too dry but was cooked just right so that it was not.  It had a twinge of spicy that wasn't too strong for my Caucasian taste buds, but left a nice afterburn lingering in my mouth.  It wasn't too salty or too oily, there wasn't too much gravy drowning out the noodles, and they didn't skimp on meat and vegetables and give mostly noodles the way some places do.  \n\nThey also have a nice wine selection, and a decor that looks both classy yet ethereal at the same time.  \n\nI'm also intrigued that they have vegetarian samosas here.  Usually I cannot eat samosas as they are usually made with wheat-flour and I am allergic to gluten.  However, these ones are made with rice flour.  So I think that next time when I am with a bigger group, I will try those.\n\nOne of my favorite Thai dishes in general is either the Tom Yum or the Tom Kha soup.  What I really appreciate about this place is that you can order a small cup of soup as an add-on to your meal, and you don't have to automatically buy a large portion for about $9-10 if your friends don't all want to split it with you.  I also appreciate how their menu is laid out, so that you can decide if you want a dish that is focused around noodles, stir-fried meat, or curry, etc.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this place.  For a reasonably-priced place that isn't super expensive or high-end, the food is very tasty.", "author": "Sarah R."}

The cousin that recommended Sriracha Thai said that this restaurant had the most authentic tasting khao soi (coconut curry noodle dish) that she's had since she was in Thailand a couple years ago!! After trying it, even though we had nothing to compare it to because neither of us have been to Thailand, we agreed it was one of the best noodle dishes we've had. It had a creamy coconut curry sauce and lots of crunchies! \n\nAlong with the khao soi, we ordered red curry with chicken, the spicy chicken wings, and a bowl of rice. The red curry with chicken was verrry similar to the khao soi, but we weren't mad at it! It had more veggies and was more liquidy than the khao soi. It was really yummy over rice! The spicy chicken wings are far from spicy, but still good. The sauce is reminiscent of sweet chili sauce, and I loved that it was topped with fried basil. \n\nService was very friendly and the price point was pretty reasonable. I'll for sure be back to get some khao soi!", "author": "Tara A."}

As well as not having to feel like a pariah for offering one of the few dissenting voices.  More than 50% are five star reviews?  Really?\n\nAlthough the name may be new, Sriracha Thai looks quite similar to its predecessor, Soi Gow Cafe.  Not only is the staff/management seemingly the same, but the menu looks familiar as well (with the exception of a few dishes here and there).  Which, in total, makes all of these sparkling reviews kind of surprising; under their old name, they only had a three and a half star average!  Then again, it did make them that much more intriguing...\n\n-- (#6) SPICY CHICKEN WINGS - Deep Fried Chicken Wings topped with Chili Garlic and Crispy Basil...$7.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sriracha-thai-cuisine-san-francisco?select=Faqn9IysrFsMVQIKT77PJg)\nProbably the best thing we had, though there are better Angel Wings out there.  I liked how the batter wasn't too heavy and how juicy the chicken was.  However, while the overall flavor of the sauce was fine (not overly sweet), it really could have used a bit more heat.\n\n-- (#1) SPRING ROLL with Pork - Deep Fried Egg Rolls stuffed with Silver Noodles, Taro, and Vegetables, served with Sweet & Sour Sauce and Ground Peanuts...$6.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sriracha-thai-cuisine-san-francisco?select=3MO451RAME1ra1QLmxo24Q)\nNot really flawed, but not really memorable either.  The rolls were fried up to a perfect golden brown, weren't very oily, and had a nice amount of filling.  That said, the rolls weren't super flavorful on their own and I didn't care much for the dipping sauce (my friend liked it though).  \n\n-- (#81) PAD SEE EW with Chicken - Stir-fried Small Rice Noodles with Sweet Soy Sauce, Broccoli, and Eggs...$8.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sriracha-thai-cuisine-san-francisco?select=BeiJmFI_xoXhZ1h53V3bFw)\nNot spectacular, but pretty solid all around.  The portion was decently generous and I liked how they didn't skimp on the goodies.  Plus, the noodles had a great, chewy texture to them.  I think they could have gone a little lighter on the sweet soy sauce, but not a big deal.\n\n-- (#60) PAD GRA PROW with Beef - Sauteed with Spicy Garlic Sauce, Sweet Basil, Bell Pepper, and Vegetables...$9.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sriracha-thai-cuisine-san-francisco?select=8Ng12PI2rTnq6pJh--eIDg)\nMy least favorite dish, though due, in part, to my friend's choice of beef over chicken or pork. (either would've worked better).  It also would've helped if the sauce stuck to the meat better.  Still, there's no denying there was a good amount of beef that was quite tender.  \n\n-- (#92) KANAH MOO KROB - Sauteed Crispy Roasted Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli, Spicy Chili Garlic, and Black Bean Sauce...$12.95\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sriracha-thai-cuisine-san-francisco?select=bv2YbQJ-xXCiWbAPpWTYMA)\nA bit disappointing, to be honest.  Though it tasted fine (more salty than spicy), the dish was light on pork belly (it was the best part!).  What's more, it was made even more apparent by the dish's overwhelming amount of broccoli (side note - there were A LOT of stalks).\n\nWhile the food certainly didn't overwhelm us, there really wasn't anything \"bad\" about it.  Plus, given the lack of crowds here, it's certainly a spot worth considering for something quick in a pinch or for some take-out (if you happen to be here already, as parking around here can be a pain).

We ordered a variety of fried appetizers which were mediocre -- nothing exactly special. The wonton wrapped around the shrimp and egg rolls were pretty good though, not too greasy. \n\nI got the pad Kee Mao which was pretty good. Not too much chicken, but the flavor was pretty good. \n\nThe others in my group had other dishes that were more disappointing. :/ there was the rad na (thick noodles on gravy) -- thought the gravy could be a little thicker and there could definitely be a little more portion-wise. The specialty entree (forget the exact name) came with a green curry, overcooked vermicelli noodles, and some small pieces of salmon on the side. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the place was nice -- serene background music, normal voice levels, decent seating and spacing.

Everything about the meal was right, and yet we were one of only five tables!\n\nWe had the chicken pad sew, the beef pad kee mao, and the duck curry.\n\nThe pad sew was fantastic. Great balance of flavours. I had it with the chicken, but I think beef would have been better. The chicken was by no means dry, but it was definitely less moist.\n\nThe roasted duck in red coconut curry was delicious. I didn't have much, since I found it a bit spicy, but my friend loved it. I have to disagree with Andrea V., though; we found that we needed an extra order of rice. As for the pad kee mao, the meat ratio was a little low, and I've had better rice noodles. But it was still quite tasty.\n\nThe Thai iced tea was good, if a bit sweet. I had never had it before, but I think I would get it again.\n\nThe decorations weren't anything to write home about, and the instrumental music playing was light and inoffensive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-03-08", "description": "Some background: this spot used to be named \"Soi Gow Thai Noodle Cafe\". The same man who owns this restaurant also owns \"Sri Thai Cuisine\" that's located on 48th and Lincoln in the Outer Sunset. In a way, you can say that these two family owned restaurants dominate the Sunset District in terms of Thai food, because both are incredibly tasty and offer quick service at affordable prices.\n\nThis specific location had a re-birth if you will. They changed their name to \"Sriracha Thai\" and remodeled the outside of the restaurant to a more modern look. Though management never changed, they definitely stepped up their game. Before changing their name, they had a 3.5 stars on Yelp, and now sit at 4.5 stars. It's definitely deserving, as they deliver perfectly in all areas: the Red Curry with Chicken here is top notch. Quick tip: one order can feed two people, just make sure to order side rice for each of you. The Satay Chicken is always great, even before their re-branding, this was always my go to appetizer. The peanut sauce is just awesome. Lastly, the Pad Thai. Hard to compare to all the other Thai places I've been to in the past, but I will say that it's as good as any here. \n\nThe one thing they excel at is making high quality Thai food at inexpensive prices. I love that they import their tea from Thailand- something that I asked the woman working here because I was hoping to find out where I can buy the tea myself. Just a short fly away from Thailand! It also is just 1 dollar tea, what a deal considering the lady refilled my tea at least 4 times. They are very attentive here and strive for good service. \n\nFinal verdict: this place is fantastic. Located on a quieter block of the inner Sunset, it's a great place for a night out. The service here is impeccable- food comes out right on time and in the perfect order. Speaking of the food: yum, yum, yum! I have absolutely zero complaints about Sriracha Thai. Definitely a place you need to visit at least once, if not more!", "author": "Alex B."}

I had to pick the beef out from my dish because I was having a hard time swallowing it. I mean come on, you're making all the cows in the world look bad. You're not doing justice to their delicious meats. Undercooked and bland, it's literally the worst beef I've had in my life. \n\nOk, maybe I just had a bad dish. I turned to my right and my friend who ordered the Pad Thai with Chicken - she didn't even touch her dish. She prbly had like one or two bites of it and that was it.

However, I had an incredibly bad experience that I don't wish upon anyone. My son has allergies, so eating out is a struggle for us. He's allergic to soy (soy sauce, soy bean oil, soy lecithin...etc) , which can be found in a lot of foods. My husband ordered from Sriracha a couple of nights ago and asked for NO SOY. NO SOY PLEASE. When he picked it up the nice lady at the front said \"don't worry, I took care of it\" so we eat it. Next thing you know, my son is having a full blown reaction, which he hadn't had in almost a year!!! I'm heart broken. He's in pain, the whole family is. I couldn't understand what caused it, until I called Sriracha and asked what oil they used for the fried rice. You can only imagine how I felt when they answered \"soy bean oil\" even though they had in their computer about our allergies. Again, I love this place. But they've caused us so much pain and they can't take it away. Of course they were apologetic and offered a refund, but nothing can take away the pain they caused my son and my family. Thank you for apologizing,  but please next time take allergens more seriously. My son is ok and he'll get better in a few days, but another family may not be as lucky as us.

Easy for 2 people to come here and spend $40-$60 in order to get full, not including tip. \nService is good, staff are friendly and the food comes pretty quick.", "author": "Richard V."}

All the outside noises are muted out. \nWe ordered the red curry, tum yum soup, and pad Thai. All the dishes were very good and the potions are quite large compared to other Thai restaurants where we live, in the South Bay, and prices are around the same range. I found the curry and pad Thai a bit on the sweeter side but they're both very flavorful. \nThe service was great! We didn't have to ask for anything. The waiter gave us plates to share, water refills, and took our empty plates out of the way for more room on the table. \nI'd definitely come back! I wish it was closer to where we live!", "author": "Catherine L."}

My mom ordered some kind of coconut soup (I'm typically not a fan of coconut but I tried a sip of the soup and absolutely loved it!).  Their thai iced tea is the best I've ever had--the perfect blend of sweet and creamy.  Can't wait to go back and try other dishes!  \n\nNOTE: This place is literally right next to the N line, so every 15 minutes or so, you're gonna hear that train rumble on by.

A Thai friend of ourselves told us to say \"no chili and no hot red pepper\" rather than mild.   Told the waitress no child and no hot red pepper, and what arrived--hot red pepper on her meal.   Told the waitress who was annoyed, even though she had been told about the hot pepper.   The cook simply washed the meal and put a different sauce on it, so everything was mushy and watery.    I think that the waitress did not really pass on the request to the cook.   Either she was a newbie or just didn't care.
