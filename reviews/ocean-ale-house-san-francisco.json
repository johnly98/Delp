When we first arrived we were pleasantly greeted and given drink and food menus but then waited quite a while for service. We were about to leave when the waitress apologetically came to serve us and offered a round of beer on the house.\nWe tried several taps and settled on\nbarrel Brothers IPA, a mildly hoppy but delicious brew accompanied by the grilled chicken sandwich special and delicious green salad. The food was great, the atmosphere was low key but fun and overall a very positive experience!", "author": "Karen W."}

Was already out here in the city so might as well try something new and fun. Ocean Ale House comes from good recommendations on Yelp, so I made the trip out there.\n\nIt's quite actually easy to miss especially since you can't really tell its an alehouse from the outside and it's just on a busy street. There is a residential street that is the cross street and you can park there for free if you're stopping by (which is what I did). Stopped in I assume during happy hour hours because it was around 330pm, so you would naturally only assume everybody has a happy hour. \n\nLarge space, great for coworkers to hang out or a nice bar area for you to do work (they have free wifi, just ask for the password). The rotating beers were written on a board on tap, but also printed out on a menu. Friendly staff willing to answer questions that you might have and encouraging to order some eats with your brews. \n\nThe cider on tap was Mission Trail Cider Lawyers Plums and Monkey (Cider | Other Fruit | Bradley, CA) with a 13.9 ABV. WUUUUUUUUUT? GET OUT OF HERE! 9oz draft was the best 12 dollars that I ever spent It was delicious and they have a great food menu. I was looking at everything people around me ordered and looked delicious and the portions were huge for the price. Luckily, I wasn't so hungry so I just ordered some fries to soak up the alcohol. HUGE wedge fries that had skin and were seasoned and fried so nicely. \n\nDefinitely a great place to come hang out and try a couple of local brews. Chill place, unexpected especially for the surrounding area. A great find for sure!", "author": "Winnie G."}

The food offerings are also solid and are a notch above run-of-the-mill pub fare in that they try to source well in terms of their meats. The burgers, as a result, are a nice bet.\n\nWhen I visited, I made it in well before closing time, but they seemed in a bit of a rush to close. I can't blame the employees for wanting to get home on time, but the overall feeling was that the effective closing time was much earlier than advertised. Something to keep in mind if you're also out late.", "author": "Vincent L."}

I never thought of myself as a beer connoisseur. I knew I liked Racer 5 and Bud Light and everything in between.  Well my brother introduced me to this place a couple of years ago.  Introduced me to Miles and Daniel which are not only friendly and fun to talk to but they really know there stuff.  \n\nFirst off the Ale House rotates beers from many local breweries.  You could go a couple times a week and find a different selection on the wall. Like I said I wasn't a beer connoisseur but the knowledge Miles and Daniel have regarding the different brews was like talking to a wine Sommelier. Yes they have wine too but I haven't tried any of their selection.  Anyways I feel like I have a much better understanding of the different brew types now thanks to the crew at Ocean Ale House.\n\nNow lets talk about the food.  A duck egg on a burger? Yes please.  Much like the beer menu the food menu rotates as well. Constantly changing.  Miles takes chicken wings, fries, grilled cheese sandwiches etc and finds a way to kick them all up a notch.  Sometimes he will have some new creation that he wants to try out so it may be a one  or two day thing. So be sure to always take a look at what the days options are.  Don't want to miss anything.  \n\nIf you are a local to the city whats your excuse. get over there.  If you are from out of town and want to try some local beers come here.  They usually have multiple local breweries on tap.  Get a taste of what the bay is all about without going to multiple spots.", "author": "eric t."}

I've wrestled with writing a critical review for the last six months, because I really want to support this business. I love what Miles and crew are doing to the neighborhood by creating a really great social space and a sense of community. The entertainment is great, the atmosphere fun and familiar, and overall the place has great energy. The beer selection is excellent, and though a touch on the pricey side, I will gladly pay an extra dollar or two to support bringing a cool bar to the neighborhood. \n\nWhere Ocean Ale House could stand to improve is food execution and pricing. The concept behind the menu is great, but every time I go there the food leaves me feeling disappointed. I've had the burger twice, and both times the patty was overly salted and seasoned. The grilled cheese was too greasy, and the fries are overcooked. Everything on the menu seems to be $2-$3 more than it should be, which wouldn't be a problem if the execution was better. I usually only come only once every couple of months hoping that the food will improve, but so far it hasn't.

We couldn't see the performers very well, but there isn't a bad seat for hearing them. Cuban country music was on the bill, a somewhat amateurish trio I thought but very entertaining and as I said, free.\n\nThe menu is entirely burgers and sandwiches, with an arugula salad at the bottom. We ordered two Classic Smash Burgers and the salad to eat, a Tenderloin Cotton Candy and a Honk if Your Heffy to drink. The burgers appeared rather simple in this day and age of extravagant gourmet creations, but were tasty. I didn't like the fries, which were thin, burnt and cold. The arugula salad was well executed and good-portioned. The drafts were outstanding, as expected. We also each had a glass of cabernet sauvignon, surprising for not being rot gut (beer bars not surprisingly overlook their wine list sometimes, or at least do not give much thought to them). \n\nThe graciousness and hospitality of the staff was uniformly excellent. I'd say that the owners of Ocean Ale House have found their exact, true calling in life. I saw everyone clearing glasses and plates, helping hand chairs around, welcoming and chatting with the patrons, and appearing to enjoy it all. It made me feel like a neighbor to everyone else, though I came across town and rarely go out on Ocean Avenue.", "author": "Brian G."}

Ocean Ale House does a great job of rotating in local beers and some decent wines. The HUB West Coast lager (only 5.0% ABV) even tastes like a light IPA. Great ambiance, murals, and live music will accompany your drinks, and service will always be prompt and courteous.If you're not into a loud environment, you probably don't want to stick around, but it's a fun time otherwise. Food can be hit-or-miss here. For $5, you'll get a giant portion of kennebec fries, but half of them will be soggy, and the other half perfectly fried. A classic burger will set you back $12 for a smaller portion, and even the grilled cheese clocks in at over $10. Order at your own discretion. Otherwise, enjoy a few brews, and watch the Giants game.", "author": "Danny C."}

I tear up a little every month when I pay $80+ for my Clipper card, as I remember how cheap the FastPass used to be ($7 a month for all the Muni rides you can stomach, cable cars included). I don't understand how high school kids shop for formals now, ever since the Jessica McClintock outlet was supplanted by SOMA condos. \n\nThat being said, a place like Ocean Ale House did not exist (and not sure could've existed) in my sleepy neighborhood \"in the good old days\"...and OAH is a silver lining in all this change.\n\nThe draft selection is eclectic and phenomenal. I now have a new favorite gose (Jolly Pumpkin Cucurbitophobia) and tasted a citrus that had, swear on my grandma, the strong aftertaste of durian. The bartender/owner(?) with the awesome beard clearly loves what he does, and you can feel that the moment you step foot in the place. \n\nThe vibe is low-key and non-pretentious, and fits in with (rather than takes over) our humble little corner of the city.

The space is bright with an amazing mural, and communal tables of light wood. Beer selection is eclectic but hoppy, wish they had a hefe on tap. Live music with owner's dad was great but difficult to talk, need acoustic tiles or something to muffle sound which bounces off ceiling. I liked my eggs Benedict with homemade sausage, a side of fruit or potatoes would be a nice addition. Hoping with little improvements it will get a good following and succeed.", "author": "Michelle O."}

Good variety of tasty brews. \n\nFirst time food was great - got burger, fries, grilled cheese, and salad. Second time not so much - everything tasted like and texture was like the oil was at too low a temperature - very greasy. Prices are high - $12 for a burger + $4 for bacon. Menu does not change much so wouldn't go there very often for dinner because it would become repetitive. \n\nPlace is very loud. Would be good if they hung some drapery across ceiling and parts of walls to reduce the noise.\n\nCan be cold because they have to leave door open for some regulatory reason...at least thats why the proprietor said it was always open.\n\nOverall am glad to have the addition of the variety and general atmosphere.

It doesn't have the \"crazy/party\" vibe, which I'm pretty thankful for. It's a great place to enjoy a drink and catch up with some friends.

I have been there 4-5 times recently and the beer selection is very good, well varied, (not slanted in the IPA world as many tap houses are), and the service is very good. Live music no cover charge and the couple of bands I've seen are really good. Lots of local SF residents from Ingleside and neighboring districts like Westwood Park, Sunset, Glen Park, etc. Miles, the owner is really knowledgeable about the beer and food as well as all the breweries in SF. Food is very good for the menu they are going for and is presented well. It's prepared by a chef that really cares and seems to love what he does. The whole staff is great and it's a friendly cool hang out including for families with children. Parking is pretty good, prices are reasonable, and it's a welcome business to the ever changing Ocean Ave that we all love. Highly recommend to locals and visitors alike. This part of the City is often missed by many that don't come over to the South West side of the City.

Although he seemed polite to the other customers I couldn't help but notice I had to be the youngest person there.  The spacial organization of the bar created an intensely close atmosphere for such a large barroom and the acoustics made it impossible not to shout to the person next to you.  The food came with great delay and was a meager portion for the price.  Hopefully this place can adapt to the change the neighborhood's environment is about to experience, but for me this place is a pass until a better experience can be achieved.", "author": "Karon H."}

I arrived at 10:30 am.  They were not open (rather they were not ready, per the owner).  I waited with a beer and ordered the worst burger ever.  On the menu it was $14, I'm like ok... I'll give it a shot. When I received it.....the burger patty was falling apart and burnt.   You do not get a tomato because \"it's out of season\".  You do not get fries with it.  And the lettuce was pitifully chopped iceberg and it came with \"homemade \" American cheese.  I expressed my dissatisfaction and was given many lame excuses.  The price on the menu was changed at that point to $10.  My recommendation is to go to beeps right around the corner.  Maybe go for a beer since it's not made there.  They just pour it.  So sad.", "author": "J. H."}

Unfortunately, this place was a let down.  The space is nice and the beer list decent, however, it has some major logistical problems. First, they\narbitrarily changed the opening time last minute without notice. Once inside, you can only order a beer by standing in an enormous line run by one person. He works the register taking both food and drink orders, then walks across the way to fill your beers and walks back to work the register to complete your transaction. If you ordered food, you'll get a number to wait at your table. The whole process is slow and tedious and it took over 20 minutes to get a round drinks! Needless to say, there was no desire to get a second round. This place either needs to hire more people to work the bar and figure out a way for people to order drinks without standing in that ridiculous line or there'll be plenty more frustrated, one-time customers.", "author": "Jenny M."}

I had the house made reuben, amazing flavor, meat quality was epic, shout out to the chef. I also had the fruh kolsch and it was served in the proper kolsch glass, on top of it making the beer taste better, it also gets you drunk quicker ;) mad props to ocean ale house!", "author": "Andy P."}

Very friendly and attentive staff, it's a relatively new establishment on Ocean ave and they're becoming my favorite spot to hang out. Prices are a bit high for beer (the cheapest is $7)BUT they have excellent selection of quality beers! Very large space and can host big groups, with chill and easy (but not messy!) vibe. Highly recommend if you're looking for a respectable but also non-snobby place to entertain friends. It's a good option to the *ahem more raucous dive bars on Ocean (which I also LOVE!)", "author": "Clint S."}

Not another IPA house although they keep a couple of good IPA's on tap, they also have Belgians.  We had a good spinach salad and these great hot dogs.  Killer local band playing.  All in all I'd definitely return.", "author": "Kate C."}

Not from here, and have lamented the fact that bars here are hard to socialize in if you go by yourself. Conversations spark at the bar, everyone is fun, the two guys that own the place are great - really nice and very funny. The beer selection is great, and the taps rotate often. Prices aren't bad at all compared to the rest of the bars in this city. I wish I could spend way more time hanging out there, but life and responsibility don't allow for hanging out in bars all night anymore. I recommend everyone to check it out.", "author": "Jessica M."}

The owners are really knowledgeable about their beer. This is Craft beer at its best.  It's about time we got a bar that you really want to go to. Sadly, outer Ocean Avenue doesn't have any really good bars but the Ale House changes that. All kinds of craft beer where you can meet with friends and relax and enjoy your evening.", "author": "Keith M."}
