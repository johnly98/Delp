After a good lunch at a nearby ramen joint where the meal was too salty, I wanted ice cream and went into Super Duper.  They had a sign outside that that serve ice cream swirl. \n\nThe child size was more than enough. I shared with Hubby. It was mix of choc and vanilla on a cone. Hubby liked the chocolate flavor. The swirl was OK and very generous for $3. The adult version was $5 and 5 swirls she told me. It started to melt quickly such that I could only imagine what a mess it would be if I got the adult cone instead. And it wasn't even a hot day outside. \n\nNot sure I'd get the ice cream again but I think I'd pop in to try the burgers next time.", "author": "Ry T."}

Great wall art. We beat the crowd, but not by much. There was a line out the door while we waited on our food.\n\nWe got the Mini Burger -- one patty only -- for $5.75. We also added cheese, which was an additional 50 cents. Nice and juicy, great flavor. Quite pricey, though, considering it wasn't even a combo. No fries or drink.\n\nWe also got a Cookies & Cream Super Shake for $5.75. This was SO delicious, we finished it in minutes. So creamy and rich and sweet. Decent size, too. I would absolutely recommend their Super Shakes over the Regular Shakes.

Yes, I hated myself after this meal and took a long walk uphill on California St. and around the block a couple of times before heading back to work.  However, I understand and respect the hype.  The cheeseburger was super duper fresh and juicy, the shake is large and filling enough to make a meal on its own, super duper chocolatey, and the garlic fries, although deliciously crisp and cheesy, HOLY MOTHER, is super duper garlicky to give someone super duper stank breath for days.  Next time, I shall ask for light garlic.  \n\nSo, there is a next time in the future? Of course!  In fact, I brought my children here for the first time yesterday.

They take a while to cook the meal, but the result was excellent and I was quite amazed at the quality. That being said, the food was a little on the pricey for what it was, at about $5.50 for a one patty burger, and like $7.75 for a two patty burger. When you order they hand you one of those round circle things and it beeps when your food is ready (they are slower than most fast food places).\n\nThe burger was excellent though, especially the patty. It was seared nice and well on the outside, having an almost crispy outer layer, but it was nice and juicy on the inside. The sauce was pretty good too, not too overpowering, it was like a light thousand island sauce with a bit more sour.\n\nOverall I was quite impressed, and will probably be back to try more.

I really don't see a huge variation in the quality of the burger or the fries, though I don't mean that necessarily as a compliment. After all, McDonald's doesn't display any variation in the burgers at their various locations either, even with their so-called custom line of burgers. In fact, you count on them to present the exact same burger, and I think Super Duper has managed that feat at their locations, the Kearny Street location not being an exception. I went for the $12 Super Combo, which allowed me a $7.75 Super Burger.\n\nThe so-called deal included a double patty burger slathered in their super sauce (whatever that is) plus an extra 75-cents for cheese, an order of fries that would have cost $2.75, and a $2.25 fountain drink (photo: http://bit.ly/2fiHIsJ). So I saved a whopping 75-cents by ordering the combo, not an insignificant amount as I prepare for an economic depression induced by Trump's trickle-down idiocy. So did it meet my expectations? Pretty much with the burger juicy though a tad too greasy to be fully enjoyable. What disappointed was the service which was curt and abrupt. We went downstairs where all the seating was.

I love supporting the smaller shops as best I can. \n\nSo I decided to order a dipped cone and noticing they had garlic fries I knew I couldn't pass that up. The person who took our order was quite stoic and not very friendly. I figured it was probably because it was 6pm and towards the end of the work day.\n\nThe dipped cone reminded me of the dipped ice cream at Wiz Bang Bar in Portland except with limited flavors. It was a vanilla soft serve with a hard chocolate shell with a traditional soft serve cone. The vanilla flavor was pretty standard, but the chocolate shell was the highlight. It was a nice thin cool piece of chocolate. I really liked how it added more texture to my soft serve. And for only $4 it was a very nice after work treat!\n\nThe garlic fries were one of the best fries I have ever had next to the baseball garlic fries I can only get when I go to a game. The fries were freshly fried and perfectly crisp. The aged cheddar was generously portioned with fresh garlic. IT was so good! Afterwards I had a bit of garlic breath, but it was well worth it.

Nothing much really to them, you can go to almost anywhere and get something either the same or similar. Just..Regular. When it comes to \"Burgers\" this is where places tend to be similar or just..\"Duper\" which to me means \"The Same\" but this place is anything but \"Duper\" in fact it's \"Super Duper\"..Super the Same? Well it's the same because its a \"Burger\" but \"Super\" because its out of the ordinary. Super Duper Burgers is like my other favorite burger place (The Habit) on ROIDS! and well to be honest....my forming habit my have shifted to Super Duper Burgers. Here is my review!\n\n5/12/16\nI was feeling good this day, I had a pocket full of dough, I was day 3 into my mini vacation after my exit from my \"Former\" job and I remember bookmarking \"Super Duper Burgers\" a while ago after seeing a few of my friends in the \"Yelpdom\" write great reviews and brag about the awesomeness that this place is. After hanging with \"Porsche C\". On my birthday, I remember on our Uber ride to my faaaaaaaavvvvorite hangout in SF \"North beach\" we passed by this location. And low and behold this was one of the spots I bookmarked. So naturally I knew I was going to go, plus I had planned it in my mind to go on this day. So I polished my \"Gold Chains\" and threw on something nice and set off to SF.\n\nService 5/5\nFood 5/5\nCleanliness 4/5\n\nI get to SF an hour early, I did that on purpose so I could fully take in the experience. And good thing I got there when I did because it was \"Happy Hour\" and happy hour at a burger joint you may ask yourself....well yea \"Happy Hour at a Burger Joint\" they serve \"Beer\" here and you can buy it by the pitcher if you want! Pretty cool huh!\n\nFood:\nI got in and took a look at the menu and knew what I wanted. I got the Super Burger (two 8oz beef patties) with Super Sauce $7.75 and I added Cheese $.75 and what's a Burger without Bacon? $1.00 and I added Garlic Fries $3.25 and a Glass of Red Racer IPA aka \"Beer\" $5.00 to make it a combo $15.50 all together and that is with the $2.75 off the fries for \"Happy Hour\" because the fries are free if you buy a \"Beer, during happy hour (garlic fries are $.50 during happy hour) \n\nThe burger was everything I expected it to be. It was amazing....The meat tasted so fresh and clean and it was cooked at a nice medium. The Onions which I had fresh (although a grilled option is on the menu) was crisp and complimented the nice taste of the meat along with the lettuce which didn't seem to wilt up too much from the heat of the burger. The buns were lightly toasted and held up to the over all make up of this masterpiece.\n\nThe Garlic Fries are hands down the \"Best\" garlic fries I've ever had. Just make sure to have some mints or gum handy though if you plan to be social after eating these. The fries were crispy and fresh and stayed hot. The garlic infused oil topped with minced garlic and parmesan cheese completed this simple yet \"Super\" experience for me. I honestly wished I had a bigger tray of them.\n\nWill I go back here?\n\nUm....That's a big YES! Like this place took that thang, flipped it and reversed it and made it into something new. I would love to see a Super Duper Burger near my neck of the woods.\n\nIn Conclusion, I personally never thought I would develop a love affair with a burger joint. Let alone one in San Francisco which to me is a \"Yelpers\" paradise of good eats. But Super Duper Burgers is worthy of all the praise I've given it, and this location off Kearny St about a block away from Montgomery St Bart is where I been too so I can't speak for other locations just yet. But if you in SF and want a Burger I say come here and get one. Happy Hour is Mon - Fri 4pm to Close and Sat 2pm to 7pm. I say come here and see for yourself if you've never been.

The mini burger is the perfect size (less than $5) if you're not a big eater and the garlic fries are freakin delicious. They do happy hour until closing on the weekdays, which means you get a free order of garlic fries with an order of beer. My friend and I shared a tangerine wheat beer, which should have meant that we got free garlic fries...but no, the server overcharged us for a combo instead :/ it should have been $10 total but he charged us $13 for a \"drink+fries+burger\" combo which is like???? Cause shouldn't the server know about the happy hour LOL\nAnyhoo stingy nitpicking aside, the burger here is truly delicious and juicy. I got the grilled onions and  chilis inside as well and it added so much flavor. The fries are super garlicky and I like how long they are!!

The bread held up well with the chicken/lettuce/bacon/and cheese. I felt that the chicken was seasoned pretty well but it wasn't crazy spectacular. I ended up eating only half of the sandwich.

It was raining today and I went out to get our lunch. When I got there it was pretty empty for 12 noon. It was clean. I got in line and was helped by employee who looked and acted like she wanted to be anywhere but there. I told her that I needed to order seperatly and one order would be paid in cash and the other order would be paid by credit card. I told her my coworker's order a min cheeseburger. My order was a super duper burger combo with only mustard (she said you put that on yourself over there), grilled onions, and bacon. She repeated my order back, \"You want a super duper burger with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, and bacon?\" I said no and repeated again. I don't understand when I go anywhere to get food people DO NOT LISTEN. It is like why are you asking if you are on autopilot and because most people order around the same thing you just assume that's my order. I made sure after I paid that she knew I didn't want the sauce because I can't have diary.\n\nMy total came to $15.56 (pretty steep)\nCombo Super Fries Soda-13.00\nBacon-1.25\ntax-1.21\nSF Bag ordinance- 0.10\n\nI walked back to the office with two paper bags in my hand, soda, and umbrella.

The burger was alright it was greasy the bun on the bottom was soaked in grease. Comparing it to  Habit in Alameda, CA since the burger size is around the same and they offer a double burger as well, Habit is better, and better price for what you get.

So we made our way back to Super Duper and the too good to be true deal.\n\nI ordered a Racer 5 IPA (there were only 2 other beer options, this seemed to be the best pick imo) and got the garlic fries for just a $0.50 upgrade! Our fries came out fast - with a big pile of garlic and cheese on top! The fries were reeeeeeaaaaaaaallllllyyyyy greasy though. It left a puddle at the bottom of the paper bowl and I had to pass on the fries that were drowning in the oils. They were also kind of cold... but they were still so good for being free!!

I got a Beer on tap ($5): Tangerine wheat beer, Lost coast brewery, Eureka, CA. It quenched my thirst. One of my friend's paired his burger with a Super shake ($5.75): Double chocolate & chips.

There are plenty of reviews, so I'll keep it simple...in my opinion, for the bang and the buck, Super Duper Burgers are the best! I've had San Francisco burgers from Roam, Umami, Gott's, In-N-Out, Mo's, Brenda's, Zuni Cafe, etc, etc, but Super Duper is my number one choice. The menu is simple, which is how a burger joint should be. I add bacon, cheese, and a fried egg to my burger, each at an additional charge. The bacon is premium, not your run of the mill bacon, and the egg is usually fried perfectly runny, sunny side up. The extra additions are definitely worth it! The fries are awesome, the soft serve is awesome, the free homemade pickles are awesome. If you wish, have your burger with a tasty draft beer or a delicious shake (you can get it spiked with vodka). They've somewhat recently added a special burger menu (see attached picture). The Blue Cheese burger, to which I additionally add bacon, is just too damm delicious!

Hence all three had failed. With the friendly staff helping me on my debut, I have high optimism on this new spot.\n\nOn my debut, I was still in the restaurant's Happy Hour zone. The deal is a free order of fries with a brew purchase. From one of three local micro-brews on tap, I ordered a tall glass of Racer-5 Indian Pale Ale (IPA) for $5.00. I also ordered the famous Double Cheeseburger for $7.00 separately to complete my dinner. I also added an egg topping for an additional $1.00. The burger patty is greasier and thicker than the other locations, including the two down on Market Street and Yerba Buena Garden. The fries are also thicker and longer too. The burger and fries tasted well with the Sonoma County brew. \n\nThough the closing hours are shorter and earlier than the other location, I think this new Super Duper has found a new home in the Financial District and gained a regular in myself!", "author": "Matt G."}

Surprisingly when I came here last week, there was a long line out the door but it moved fast!\n\nI feel I would always choose In n Out over super duper; it's just a slightly more expensive version of it. Their mini burger is very mini like a snack size rather than a full on meal. If you're hungry, I would recommend the super burger with two patties. You have options of adding cheese, bacon, or egg in your burger! For sides, I have tried both their garlic and regular fries and this time around got the trio of sauces which is worth getting at least once! Add the sauces onto your burger too! And lastly, I always have to try out a shake if I haven't just yet! I got their chocolate one which was pretty good and was a decent size; the boyfriend got a scrimshaw on tap. Bill came out to be about $30ish which is a little expensive for me and small burgers IMO, but service is friendly and seating doesn't seem to be a problem here as they have inside and outside options. Most people seem to get their food to go as it's a heavy foot traffic area. \n\nI want to try their soft serve cones here at least once! Looks like a decent sweet treat on a hot day!", "author": "Kathleen S."}

They have an allergen binder, and the counter person went through all my questions with me.  She was extremely helpful, and didn't make me feel like a pain in the neck for having a ton of allergies (soy and dairy are the tip of the iceberg).

But today I definitely had a \"meh I've experienced better\" experience.  I still gave 3 stars as an average of my 4-5 trips, but today deserved 2 stars for sure.  Today I ordered from a very friendly and sweet associate, my receipt says 1:23.  I stood around and noticed that everybody seemed to be getting their food around me, even people who came after.  I am not a squeaky wheel typically, so I just continued to wait.  Finally, after 15 minutes, I asked somebody to check on the status and she returned and said, \"it's coming right up\".  That was not super helpful because I would have assumed that the status was always that it was \"coming right up\"...I mean...after I ordered was the status \"maybe we'll do that later\"? She was definitely trying to be helpful, so I just accepted the response and stepped back to keep on waiting.  5 more minutes went by and I decided to approach the counter and ask for a refund so that I could leave - I really needed to get back to work. Right as I did, my order came up.  I checked the time and it was 1:44.  21 minutes for a chicken sandwich and nothing on the side.  Just one chicken sandwich.  I wish I could say that the chicken sandwich was phenomenal and worth a third-hour wait, but it wasn't.  It was just OK.  \n\nI can't say that I'll be rushing back to Super Duper on a lunch break.  The employees are all very friendly, but there should have been more communication with me regarding that wait.  If it is standard to wait 20 mins for their chicken sandwich, they should let you know that when you order.  Keep in mind that it was not busy at this time, there were 3 people in line ahead of me when I came in (I have been there when it was NUTS and got my food in less time). If there was a mistake or an oversight, they should have informed me of that and offered to either refund me or, they probably should have tossed some fries in my bag or something.  I didn't NOT order fries because I didn't want them ya know...I was trying to be good.  But if Super Duper had corroborated some fry-consumption for me, I might have been in enough of a greasy stupor to forget all about that 20 min wait :)", "author": "Emma H."}

Not staying open as late as the other location or two but you know what they even had this special chef made burgers event thing... Just fail. Because of the staff. The location manager was really nice, or whoever seemed to be holding themselves actually accountable of something. The rest are quite gossipy childish and professionally irresponsible. My advice, since the reviews for Super Duper or \"Super Duper Burgers\" apparently are location specific is just lay some people off. It's not the location that should suffer. Or the company. This gmo and organic shakes/ice cream is a good thing. I have experienced snobbery or whatever it is however at other locations also. (Seems to be whenever I go to Metreon and Kearny locations...) And I am just not a difficult customer. Sorry, No. I am the easiest customer ever -- probably too easy. So if I'm at fault, then there you go.\n\nI recommend double chocolate milkshake which is good even though the flat or old milk can spoil the ordinary chocolate one. Not to say even this hasn't been ruined, by oreos (what the hell) and I like oreos too but this move was intentional douchmeister, (or just you go see) or with a ridiculous price. I mean I thought it was a bit expensive, but then it keeps changing. Looking back at my collected receipts (on the go, memory is low) they end up seeming to charge me extra whenever they like at the time.\nGarlic fries are always good if not healthy, even though this one adds unnecessary extra cheese which is un optional since it is made the same with the actual garlic, somehow you keep wanting to come back for more. I even had an extra dollar of change stolen from me which I went back for, due to some ridiculous \"you walked in therefore I don't like you\" mentality which can only be described as petty as jealousy.\n\nI love Super Duper. I recommend any place with reasonable food and health standards such as they provide (I notice Chipotle.) They seem to be so busy they just hire whoever, and though I like their flyer -- \"looking for superstars\" they seem to offer whoever thinks they're awesome rather than who actually fits the people type of customer service, and courtesy. I am not looking for anything extra special when it comes to service. Just don't be such a dick. Three stars for petulant staff being Super douchey.\n\nPs cheese on garlic fries should be optional. Maybe even a bit less charge. Chocolate shake might be less especially if staff are dicks. I am afraid of going in next time and getting spit.", "author": "M R."}

Actually, wait, this could be a blessing or a curse. I'm going to be walking past this store front every morning...uh oh. \n\nI think it's luck that I walk past this spot everyday in the morning to get to the office because I got to try out their mini breakfast combo on Thursday (5/28), during the first day of their soft opening. I was walking and I heard \"Want to try a free breakfast?\" Um, yeah, I'd love to! I got the egg sandwich and didn't know I could ask for ham or bacon, so it only had cheese and chipotle mayo. I had a choice of orange juice or coffee and went with coffee since they brew Four Barrel here (I love their coffee). They handed me a buzzer that would vibrate when my order was up. There was someone outside ushering people inside to try out their breakfast, so the place was pretty packed during soft opening, but the folks in the kitchen were cranking things out as quickly as they could. It took maybe 15 minutes total to get in and out. I walked back to my office to eat and noticed the donut was sweating bullets (oily), eek. The egg sandwich was delicious, however, with the chipotle mayo. Yum! My co-workers tried to go grab breakfast a little later and they had run out, but Super Duper gave them a coupon for a free ice cream cone with purchase of a burger.\n\nThe next morning (5/29), I walked past again and went inside for another round of free breakfast. By Friday, those who had gone the morning prior had told their colleagues, so it was busier even though I was there at the same time (around 8am). Oh well. I heard the person in front of me ask for bacon, so I did the same. Yum, bacon. The cashier that took my order had large coffee cups at his register, so I got a large coffee, woohoo! Oh the simple things that make me happy :)\n\nMonday (6/1) was their grand opening, but I decided to take a break from Super Duper's breakfast. I came back on Tuesday though because, honestly, the $5 mini combo is a pretty darn good deal. Egg sandwich + donut + small coffee for just $5 ($5.44 with tax). It seems that they've gotten their donut process down because my donuts were fluffy on the inside and weren't oozing with oil.

And the taste was exquisite. Interestingly, this burger does not scream an in-your-face flavor like some burgers. Rather, its quality sneaks up on you. Proof is: the last bite is as good, or better, than the first. On my travels here in \"The City\" I also took a meal at Split, which is similar (metal trays, burger, fries in box, organic), but I'd have to say this here establishment is better. So to conclude: My question is answered as yes. The super duper burger is, in fact, duper. A friendly server in the front tops off this experience, which is highly recommended by this reviewer.", "author": "Joseph K."}

I specified to them that I wanted my burger to be well done but it came out \"rare\". I took it back to the person, Victor who I specified my burger to be well done, and I told him that it was the second time that SuperDuper made my hamburger \"rare\" when I specified well done. He apologized, immediately replaced it for me and etc. He handled it professionally and with great customer service and that is what I like about this place.  It is a great place to have lunch with great seating and friendly staff.", "author": "Anonymous B."}

Their claim that their burgers are cooked medium is unfounded in my case as it came out well done and most of the juice came from the lettuce and tomato. Average fries, nothing spectacular. Homemade pickles were good, however. Decent value for what you get but not somewhere I'd go out of my way to visit again.", "author": "Chris M."}

The egg white should not be clear. If you can get past these issues, you will enjoy the burger.", "author": "Winston L."}

I'm not sure if they were over fried (they didn't look or taste burnt) or if they were old. Other than the disappointingly hard donuts, the service is great and the burgers are good.", "author": "Jennifer B."}
