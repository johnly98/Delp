Locanda did that today with the grilled whole fish (trout) as well as their chocolate budino dessert.  The rest of the dining experience, from the starter to the pasta to the beverages and the service, was on point as well. \n\n(1).  The meal started with marinated anchovies and these were really great. The super fresh anchovies are lightly cured and doused in olive oil.  If you are a fan of anchovies, this dish is for you. \n\n(2).  When dining at an Italian establishment, you have to order a pasta dish and the server recommended the Fettucine with soft shell crab as the best pasta to go with the fish. She was right - the pasta was perfectly cooked and complemented the rest of the meal. I also got the pro-tip to pour the olive oil from the anchovies to this pasta and this really took the pasta to a new level. \n\n(3).  The grilled fish was trout - it came with simple sauces and was just spectacular. \n\n(4).  The chocolate budino dessert was perfect to me - it had savory/sweet/bitter flavors with contrasting textures and temperatures. This is the kind of dessert that really stands out for me. It's Michelin star quality. \n\nIn the beverage department, the house made ginger beer was great and I always like peppermint tea with chocolate at the end of the meal.  Service was attentive and the ambiance is indicative of the gentrification of Valencia street.  With tax and tip, this was about $110, a bargain in terms of fine dining these days. Highly recommended and I'll be coming back.", "author": "Andrew S."}

Our waiter was nice, but he made me slightly uncomfortable with his comments..\n\nI tried:\n- bucatini (red sauce with bacon)\n- rigatoni carbonara (creamy sauce w/ bacon)\n- cacio e pepe (pasta w/ pepper sauce, too peppery in my opinion)\n- mashed potatoes (so yummy!)\n\nThe pasta was cooked well and the flavors were pretty good, but I wasn't blown away. Overall, it was a pretty expensive meal and I didn't feel like I got my money's worth with the quality of service/food.

At the end of the meal, the manager came by and mentioned she'd like to make it up to us at a next visit. \n\nSo return we did - and this time we were treated to free bread, prosciutto and a round of prosecco. Not a bad way to improve my sentiments!\n\nLocanda's handmade pasta is very tasty but where I was truly impressed during our third visit was the fresh fish dish. It was served in it's own broth along with a hearty and delicious assortment of fresh vegetables: reminded me of a lovely dinner I had once on a farm, but right in the middle of the Mission!\n\nAlso not to be missed is the salted focaccia (made in-house). A restaurant has to do bread pretty darn well to charge for it and while it pains me a bit to pay for it, this dish is well worth it. \n\nBrunch is decidedly overpriced for what it is.

We (group of 6) showed up a bit early for our reservation and had to stand around right until the reservation time, so do keep that in mind if you're going to show up early--this place is popular!\n\nOnce seated, we were quickly noticed by our server who explained some of the menu options to us, and also informed us of the specials. We got a round of drinks going almost at once--I highly recommend the Prince if you enjoy Boulevardiers--and the appetizers began arriving shortly afterward. Midway through our appetizers, we ordered our entrees as well as another round of drinks. At the end of all that food, we were too stuffed for dessert, as enticing as some of those options looked.\n\nSome highlights of the meal:\n- Jewish-style Artichoke: a must-have! This is a traditional Roman preparation, and it's hard to find in this part of the world. Fried yet chewy, and delicious.\n- Fried olives: boy were these good. Light, crispy, and juicy to a fault.\n- House-cured anchovies: I usually don't like anchovies, but even I caved in and enjoyed a piece of these. The hint of spice accompanying them was perfect.\n- Pizza Bianca: who knew you could make such wonders with perfect bread, olive oil, and salt? We pigged out on our first really hard, and ordered a second immediately after.\n- Rigatoni alla Carbonara: al dente pasta, lusciously creamy sauce, and perfectly smoked meat? I was all in from the first bite.\n\nOverall, this was a thoroughly enjoyable meal. The restaurant takes reservations for slightly larger groups like ours, which made it perfect for the occasion. I can see why this spot is so popular!", "author": "Leela S."}

Locanda is the place to dine for its creative takes on Italian food--I came for brunch on a Sunday with a reservation, and we were seated in the airy, bright dining room. \n\nThe brunch menu is so creative--we started with the eggs in purgatory, which came with two baked eggs in a spicy tomato sauce, shaved pecorino cheese, and grilled pizza bianca (airy, chewy pizza dough-like bread) on the side. Oh my goodness.. the pizza bianca was the perfect vehicle for dipping into the spicy, flavorful, decadent sauce, and every bite was bursting with flavor! The only problem was that there wasn't enough pizza bianca in an order, so we got two more side orders to finish the dish up! \n\nWe also had the eggs benedict carbonara--a really creative take on the classic brunch dish. Instead of an English muffin, the entire dish was built on more pizza bianca, and instead of ham, there was thinly-sliced, relatively lean prosciutto on top. The eggs were poached beautifully and topped with a \"cacio e pepe\" (cheese and pepper) hollandaise sauce. Whoever thought this dish up was a genius! Finally, we had the savory porridge, a simple yet tasty concoction of oats, maitake mushrooms, ricotta, and greens. Nothing crazy here (after all, it's just oatmeal), but a great way to round out the meal.\n\nLocanda is definitely a place I'd recommend for brunch, and I'm already hoping to come back for their dinner service.

The food and service were great, but definitely on the pricier side, so save this place for a special occasion and make reservations if you plan to come here because it can get booked rather quickly.\n\nWe ordered the pizza bianca, which I thought would be an actual pizza, but actually turned out to be buttery thin bread. Not to say that was bad, but it wasn't what you would expect. The grilled leg of lamb looked amazing because one of the members of our party decided to go with that option. I opted for the Cacio e Pepe because I just go nuts for pasta prepared in cheese wedges. If you're looking for a simple option that won't fill you up too much for dessert, then I would go with this. Speaking of dessert, the one you absolutely must try is the Mocha Semifreddo. Even in pictures it looks rich and mouthwatering!

Since the other spot didn't take reservations, I voted for Locanda. (I hate waiting when I'm starving.) My gf made a reservation for a party of 5 for Saturday, September 3rd at 12:30pm a couple days earlier.\n\n*NV borgoluce valdobbiadene brut, prosecco superiore, veneto, italy ($14)\n*White peach bellini ($11) \u00d72\n*Aperitivo: campari, orange, lemon, prosecco ($11)\n*Gran classico spritz: gran classico bitters, lemon, prosecco ($11)\n*Four barrel coffee: buena vista, guatemala ($4)\n\nThey don't offer bottomless, so we just ordered one drink each. All the brunch cocktails looked sweet, so I just got a glass of bubbly. It was perfect as I seriously only like a couple drops if juice in my mimosas. It was nice and dry.\n\n*Lemon-ricotta corzetti pancakes: creme fraiche, blackberry conserva ($14)\n*Eggs in purgatory: two baked eggs, spicy tomato sauce, pecorino, grilled pizza bianca ($14)\n*Eggs benedict carbonara: two poached eggs, prosciutto cotto, pizza bianca, hollandaise cacio e pepe ($17) \u00d72\n*Two coastal hill farm eggs and grilled zucchini: cortez bottarga, brown butter ($14)\n*Berkshire pork saltimbocca: fried egg, la quercia prosciutto, sage, white wine ($17)\n*Eli's hashbrowns ($6)\n*House-cured bacon ($6)\n\nThe bacon here is delicious! Super flavorful and meaty. And such a huge portion for $6. You get six pieces! The pancakes were a favorite of mine. The perfect size as they are about the size of a silver dollar. Perfect with the fruit and creme fraiche. Not too sweet. You don't even need syrup (even though they give you some). They managed to stay light and fluffy. For the main, I got the eggs in purgatory. Good as I love tomato sauce, but if I was a big eater, I'd need more food. The portion wasn't very big. I tried a bite of everything else. Good savory dishes if you want eggs in the morning, but none of the other dishes really stood out.\n\nI'd come back again for the bacon and pancakes. And maybe try another savory dish.

If you're here for happy hour, the drinks are pretty good too.\n\nMy issue with this place is the price for the portion of food you get.\n\nWe started dinner with the artichoke small plate which, at $7, seemed like a decent deal - until it showed up. I expected a grilled artichoke, but what we got was a grilled artichoke stem. The top half of the artichoke was missing. I'm not sure what they did with it, but I was looking forward to eating it. Anyway, it tasted good, but it was a lot of money for an artichoke stem that we finished in like three bites.\n\nNext, my wife and I shared the spaghetti dish which contained a \"whole lobster\". The dish tasted good, but there's no way an entire lobster was in there. I saw the two claws and maybe some knuckle meat, but the lobster tail was nowhere to be seen. $46 is a lot of money for a single plate of spaghetti, but with a whole lobster it sounded like a decent deal. It wasn't. We were disappointed and underwhelmed. \n\nUnless you've got money to blow, skip this place and check out one of the many other amazing restaurants in the Mission.", "author": "Cory D."}

We tried both their carbonara and bucatini and both were totally on point - with tasty sauce coating each noodle.

Once you get past that, the restaurant itself is quite nice and spacious, with interesting art on the walls (at this time, they seemed to have a \"hand clutching birds\" theme).  The back room had a beautiful central floral arrangement and lighting fixture.\n\nAperitivo and Basil Cooler (non alcoholic) cocktails were good but a bit sweet.\n\nPizza Bianca - plain bread but so good, nice crust, fluffy on the inside. 5/5\n\nCrispy fava beans cacio e pepe - very peppery. Beans were lightly tempura fried but still quite greasy. Got a piece of the Jewish artichoke in it by accident and so glad we didn't order that because the texture was not great (crispy but not digestible - see my review for A Cote in Oakland... if unchewable artichoke is the new trendy thing, please count me out). 3/5\n\nLamb ragu with radiatore - tasty but a little bland.  It could have used a flavor punch and/or the brightness of a fresh herb.  It wasn't great to look at either as it was a white pasta in a red sauce with no decoration.  4/5\n\nTrout was the AQ fish and we got the last one (sat down to dinner at 7:30 on a Friday night, one of their busier nights for the market fish). It had small bones like any other trout. We got it grilled, served with spinach and capers, and didn't need all the sauces that came with it. It was served whole, which made deboning it ourselves a bit of a challenge, but I figure it's all part of the experience.  The meat of the fish was absolutely delicious.  Tender, perfectly cooked, not salty like the fish skin and side greens. 5/5\n\nDessert was the best I've had in a while. It was an angel food cake, warm and breaded with brown sugar, with dollops of pistachio syrup and a scoop rhubarb gelato. Rhubarb gelato was very clean in flavor and great accompaniment to the marshmallowy cake. Candied pistachios added a nice crunch. 5/5\n\nService was good.

I love squash and any type of veggie really, so this was a delicious way to start off the meal. Very rustic and comforting. \n\nBucatini: [5/5] Thick chewy bucatini noodles in a silky tomato sauce with guaniciale. My boyfriend loved this dish. It was very good as a bucatini amatriciana dish, I just prefer pasta dishes with more vegetables or meat. Definitely order if you're a huge fan of this dish. \n\nLamb scottadito: [4.5/5] I'm a die-hard pasta lover so whenever I go to Italian restaurants, my eyes are glued to the pasta section - I rarely look at the meats. However, my boyfriend wanted to order this and I'm SO glad we did! The lamb was amazing and definitely the highlight of the meal since I didn't expect much. The dish comes with two small lamb chops/lollipops that have been seared to perfection. The rosemary and other herbs/species are heavy-handed and absolutely delicious. There was a decent amount of meat and also a strip of fat along the bone - so yum. My only complaint would be that it was too salty. But even then, I'd still order it again. \n\nBombolini: [4/5] I had expected the bombolini to be filled with jelly inside, but instead these were mini doughnuts that came with jelly and whipped cream on the side to dip in. They came out piping hot which I appreciated. They're not as fluffy as other bombolini I've had in the past - it's texture was much more like a cross between traditional American donut and a cake donut. Either way it was still a nice way to end the meal.

I'd have to say this is a place that should be on everyone's list to visit.  The dishes range from good to stellar.  \n\nParty of 12 - Friday Evening. Celebrating my sisters birthday. We are a rowdy bunch! Well what I mean, we are, when we are dining and drinking, and enjoying ones company.  LOCANDA just makes one feel comfortable. Its decor is beautiful. Hip and trendy. \n\nNow onto the most important part...the food.\nWe had a multitude of dishes, since they are tapas (small) but adequate portions for our group. We started with either Cauiflower soup, or the Early Girl Tomato salad w/balsamic vinaigrette. I chose the salad.  Plenty of Focaccia bread and Locanda's Pizza Bianca Bread. Addicting!  Array of beverages, from white or red wine, prosecco, champagne to San Pellegrino or ginger ale. \n\nWe enjoyed a couple of appetizers. The Jewish-style Artichokes, fried till perfectly crisp & tender. Fried Castelevetrano Olives, lightly breaded with fontina cheese in the center. YUM!  \n\nNext a variety of dishes family-style, we shared the following:\nFettuccini Rabbit Sugo - perfectly al dente. Lots of rabbit.  Rigatoni alle Carbobara, typical Roman dish, with guaciale, egg, pecorino, ; black pepper. Stellar!  And the third pasta dish,  Bucatini alle' Amatriciana, a classic pasta dish executed flawlessly. The addition to guaciale and peperoncini add alot to the dish.\nWe also shared the Panchetta Wrapped Guinea Hen Leg. Crunchy skin, very moist!  One of my favorite dishes!  Grilled Halibut Collar (Special) - Skipped (don't care for halibut).\nBavette Steak w/ roasted radicchio. Tender & tasty. Loved it!  \nRoman squash and tomato confit.\nGrilled corn. Sweet chili, ricotta salata. Delish!!\n\nDessert:  We brought the birthday cake, classic St Honore Cake that LOCANDA was happy to help cut and serve. And sing!\n\nService was fast & impeccable.  We had several people serving our large party.  This is a happening, busy place, so it does get LOUD in there.  Our servers made sure we were satisfied with our experience.\n\nHave to say, my heart belongs to their pasta dishes.  All were stellar. They really do pasta well!  Portions are reasonable, not tiny but not large either. \n\nGiven that LOCANDA is the sister restaurant to Delfina, I'm not my surprised that this Roman-themed restaurant is just as good.   This is a place to go to celebrate a special occasion, job promotion, or tax refund. About $95 pp (incl tax & tip).", "author": "Janet T."}

I've eaten dinner there 3 times so far, and food, drinks, service, ambiance and location, I love everything about them.  (This review is only for dinner because I've never tried their brunch.)  \n\nAntipasti, pasta, fish, all we had so far were GREAT.  Their pasta dishes are best in town imho. Also their grilled (whole) fish of the day is a MUST-HAVE if you like fish.  I've eaten it 3 times, and every time they cooked it SO PERFECTLY.  It's quite a big dish.  But because my partner is vegetarian, I once couldn't eat it all on my own.  Then, they put it into a box, and it was still tender and tasty next day at home.  (Eating grilled fish at home without cooking/cleaning is such a treat!)\n\nTheir drinks are great too.  I like their cocktails.  Also their wine flights are delicious and quite generous.  Wine by the bottle is reasonable too.\n\nI can't wait to go back!", "author": "Akiko O."}

Thus I had no preconceived notion or judgment about Locanda and in fact was looking forward to a pleasant time. And in fact all and all except for one major factor our server was helpful and pleasant. This particular evening the menu featured a prix fixe dinner as an option featuring a selected menu by guest and visiting chef Sora Anna Dente described on the special menu as internationally recognized and \"Queen of Roman Cooking\". She was seated at a table across from the kitchen. We were told she would be circulating about the dining room greeting patrons throughout the evening. For those not wanting the entire prix fixe meal all of her special menu items were available on the regular evening menu as individual options.We opted to order of the evening menu and one of our selections was her dish, the others not.\n\nOne observation was, that from the time we passed her on our way to the table until we left she sat at her table talking with her companion getting up only once to take a photo with a party at a table almost next to hers. She never circulated the dining room greeting patrons as every table that evening was told as they were first approached by their servers. I don't raise a big issue with this as I don't know her as a chef and it didn't matter to our dinner but why tell every patron excitedly about her and that she will be circulating to meet patrons when she would not. From my direct line of site to where she was sitting I saw her talking to her companion and yawning several times. As a visiting chef presenting a menu of her creations she really should have been in the kitchen supervising her dishes at least occasionally to make sure the kitchen was serving them properly. This aspect was lacking most evidently because the signature dish of hers we ordered Fettuccine and Chicken Giblets $21, although edible and not unpleasant was pretty blah, the house made fettuccine noodles were greatly overcooked, there was a very scant amount of giblets which gave the dish only a hint of the giblet flavor leaving this dish basically a very small portion of overcooked noodles in a creamy tomato sauce with a few small pieces of chicken giblets and crumbled cheese. And it was under seasoned too boot thus pretty blah. And the portion size very small for the $21. The \"Queen of Roman Cooking\" sits yawning while her signature dish comes out of the kitchen like this? Hmmmm.... Overcooked pasta? Hmmm....\n\nWe started the dinner with one order of the housemade Coppiette (Roman Style Pork Jerkey)$2.50 /pc. Neither of us cared for the flavor which was very mildly medicinal. In fact as I ate more what came to my mind was ever so slightly that flavor of Chloroseptic.\n\nWe also started with the SHAVED ARTICHOKES - grilled ricotta, wild arugula, avocado $14. Another quite small portion.... The dressing had a lovely flavor based I believe on a nice olive oil however it was such that it rendered the wild arugula quite gloppy against the crisp shaved artichokes and there were at most 2 small pieces of grilled ricotta and possibly one thin slice of avocado. A very small salad not unpleasant to eat but poorly executed for $14.\n\nThe dish that ended up a complete fail and brings my rating from a 2.5 to a solid1is the pasta dish MEZZE MANICHE - dungeness crab, tomato, fennel $26. Once again the flavor was quite nice. You could definitely taste crab flavor although it was very hard pressed to find much of any crab meat itself. A few small shreds possibly? The pasta was slightly overcooked, but nothing to complain about and the portion was decent. ( Although with a Roman Chef present one would expect all pasta be perfect) What caused this dish to be a total fail was the presence and quantity of crab shell mixed in with the pasta. My partner's first bite had a small piece of shell, oh well, it's crab and those things happen. But the pieces became more and more and larger! Larger like break a crown or tooth larger. Half way through her dish she said she was afraid to eat it and was picking carefully through each bite. At this point one of the serve staff came by to deliver a drink and he asked how everything was. We showed him the crab shells and he smiled shook his head yes and just said \"Yeah\". At the end of the meal when our server came to clear the plates we showed her the crab shells and commented on how many and large they were and she just shook her head yes. Random and plentiful pieces of hard shell mixed and hidden within a pasta dish that could choke a patron or break a tooth gives Locanda a rating of never returning for me.\n\nWe graciously declined dessert and went to Dandelion instead.", "author": "Steven B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-15", "description": "Locanda seemed to have fallen off my radar of places to eat, but when a friend and I were looking for a place to eat dinner with about a one week notice, Locanda had great availability.  After doing some recon work via a co-worker who lives within a stones throw to Locanda, I concluded that the experience at Locanda was something to get excited over.  I snagged a 5:30pm reservation for two, and enjoyed sitting right by their kitchen area and away from the drafty door.  Since she's a fellow foodie, we decided that we should split everything and try as much as possible.  Here's what we had:\n\nAppetizers: \nJewish-style Artichoke: I'm not a huge fan of artichokes, but this came to us complimentary! After having read about this, I was excited to try it, but was sort of underwhelmed with the lack of taste it had.\nLocanda's Pizza Bianca: Honestly, I had no idea that this was just some sliced bread with olive oil and salt.  I truly thought it was table bread.  When the check came, I almost panicked that we had been charged something that we didn't get since I assumed that \"pizza\" implied more than just bread, olive oil and salt.  Oops. I guess it was good? Not sure I'd be down for paying $4 again though.\n\nPasta: \nTonnarelli Cacio e Pepe: Locanda's well-known pasta dish that has made an appearance on 7x7's Must-Eat List for 2015 was delicious.  Of all the things we ate that night, this was the best dish we had.  It wasn't the absolute best pasta I ever had, but I was certainly inspired to eat my allotted portion.\n\nMains:\nBavette Steak: I was all set to devour this until I noticed that it was cooked a little more \"rare\" than I would have liked.  While some of the pieces of meat were fully cooked (and delicious), other pieces we received seemed a little blue.  I also made the observation that the meat was sliced a little raggedly.  The sides that came with weren't bad, although I didn't really touch the escarole.\n\nBerkshire Pork Saltimbocca: My friend chose the saltimbocca, and we both struggled to finish this.  The dish itself was very salty! The thinly sliced pork was good, but it wasn't without needing a cup of water between bites.\n\nDessert:\nMeyer Lemon Shaker Crostata: My friend is a PHENOMENAL baker so it was really interesting to get her take on the dessert.  She enjoyed the Meyer lemon slices within the filling, but found the crust of the crostata to be somewhat lacking.  The crust seemed to be a little on the soggy side when we ate it.  My take on it was that it was a little too sweet where the panna didn't seem to provide enough balance to the rest of the crostata.\n\nService wise, everything was great.  I guess with all the hype that I had heard around Locanda, I was expecting more.  I definitely think that what we had was good, but for everything else that's within Locanda's proximity, it might be worth checking out some of the other places before stopping here.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Don't know why I keep giving this group of restaurants so many chances but they have disappointed on so many fronts and so many times!  \nFor dinner last night, we went for their appetizer: Oregon Bay shrimp - overpriced and more deep fried crust/dough than the shrimp itself.  Whatever shrimp was in it was every part of the shrimp but the shrimp itself!  For 10$. That's a RIP-OFF. The cheese board, whatever fancy name it went by had grapes on it, harvested from maybe last year(?)and 6 almonds ....come on ....justify the price you are charging the customer, the jam and marinated whatever, was tasteless.\nThe pasta...al dente- does NOT mean under cooked!!!  If you define yourself as a pasta place, learn the art and science of how to cook, serve and sauce this great Italian creation, don't overcharge, raise expectations and disappoint the clientele on every front!!!\nThe only reason I can give this place 3 stars is the 'Maine Lobster' that was edible, well cooked and met our expectations out of anything we ordered there!\nService was excellent.

The pastas were just ok. We had the cacio e pepe and alla Amitriciana. Both pastas were cooked perfectly but lacked \"kick\" in the taste department. They were just ok. \n\nWe had their version of the Roman artichoke. Not great. Wrong variety was used in my opinion. Too many leaves and not enough heart. I also think that artichokes are best in CA in the spring. They should offer it only then, and be more seasonal. \n\nThings we liked: fried olives. Prosciutto with flatbread. \n\nThings we loved: Service. Vibe. Atmosphere. Radish and anchovie butter. Signirilo (sp? - like broccoli greens).

Absolutely delicious with Aperol, gin, Cocchi Americano and lemon! They packed a potent punch.\n\nThe grilled Jewish-style Artichoke appetizer was a revelation and so good we had to re-order. Not to be passed up!\n\nThe grilled leg of lamb entre\u00e9 was perfectly cooked medium rare (see my photo, you don't have a choice, but medium rare is my fav). It was excellent, served with escarole, anchovy and ceci.\n\nThe shared special of the day was a stunning, humongeous whole codfish which we immediately dubbed The Whale. Poached acqua pazza, it was eaten down to the bone, even the eyeballs LOL.\n\nFor some funny reason I can't remember what desserts we ate.

The lasagna could not be just plain old lasagna. This lasagna had a different color. The lasagna noodles were green from nettle. The whole thing had a unique consistency. This ain't yo mamma's lasagna. See pic. The menu is very interesting and it seems authentic. We came here with 20 people to celebrate Guy's birthday. It was his choice to come here.

I was able to easily grab a table 2 hours ahead on a Sunday evening. \n\nWe had the Tonnarelli Cacio E Pepe, the Bucatini All'amatriciana, the Radiatore \"pecora E Pecorino\" and the Casarecce. \n\nThe Tonnarelli seemed to be very popular (it was recommended on the 7x7 must eat list apparently) and it was a creamier dish with spaghetti cooked al dente. It was chewy and cooked just right without being too heavy despite the cheese (in my opinion).\n\nThe Bucatini and Radiatore were both tomato sauce based pasta that tasted a bit similar but equally delicious. Different pasta were used and the Radiatore had lamb ragu while the Bucatini didn't contain meat but the sauce definitely had its similarities. The Bucatini was slightly spicier though with the usage of peperoncini, while the Radiatore used mint for a fresher and lighter taste. I would suggest getting one of the above instead of both.\n\nThe Casarecce seemed to be a seasonal dish and it was a spicier dish with pork. I absolutely loved the sauce, it was so good and I wish I had bread to dip into the sauce. They used green tomato in this dish, which is less common but excellent. \n\nThe alcohol selection was also quite vast. There was a great variety of cocktails and the wine we tried (a red from Tuscany) was really good. The portions at Locanda are a bit small, especially given the price, but it was really delicious and we didn't find any misses with the pastas that we tried. The atmosphere was also really wonderful - very casual and trendy but cozy. Overall, a great restaurant in the Mission with good-quality pasta that can still be easily booked on short notice.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

I enjoyed a nice fine meal with my friends and this is definitely a place to visit for fine Roman/Italian food. It is best to order many dishes and share. I would say the standouts were all the pasta dishes, especially the Beef Tortelli which I would leave on the menu. The Steak Bavette is amazing and goes well with a fine glass of Cabernet. Out of the side dishes go with the cauliflower. I usually like the Jewish artichoke, but it was a bit disappointing this time around. A little over cooked and to crispy. The ambiance is wonderful, and I would suggest sitting up front in the restaurant where there is more action. Our server Aaron was very nice and attentive as well as the other staff. Great music, mostly alternative which is great and hip. The only other things I would suggest to make this place even better would be to upgrade the wine list a bit with more California wines like Pinot Noir from Kosta Browne and Seasmoke. Some Cabernet Sauvignon standouts like Caymus and Duckhorn. Another thing I would suggest is if you see customers waiting by your front door freezing in the cold and the crazy wind like we had yesterday, then to please let us in and wait at the bar. I know you open at 5:30pm, but if we are 5 to 10 minutes early and freezing outside, then please let us in.

I really liked this combo because the bread was good and Trippa all Romana had full tomato flavor with chewy tripe. Highly recommend this combo. \n\n2) RADIATORE \"PECORA e PECORINO\"- lamb ragu, pecorino, mint\nSo salty I couldn't have more than 10 bites. The chef perhaps forgot that pecorino is a salty cheese? They probably salted both pasta and cheese, therefore the dish became incredibly salty. Again, flavorful and the lamb chunks were good.. but so salty.\n\n3) ORECCHIETTE- cotiche sausage, broccoli raab, capers, parmigiano\nAGAIN SO SALTY. Salt pasta. Salt soup. I dont know. \nThe sausage chunks were good- but again, the chef forgot to taste or something. Honestly, between two pasta dishes, orecchiette was the most interesting and delicious one. \n\nI would return back to the restaurant if they make the dishes less salty. \n\nProportion wise, they were very honest and generous. \n\nService: our service was very cold and not attentive. We had to ask several times for water and  extra dishes. Also, since we ordered only 3 dishes (?), the server was not happy.", "author": "Sue K."}

Afterall, it's on the 7x7 magazine as one of the best places to eat. \n\nI started off with the chicken liver mousse. It was okay. Not the best I've ever had, but not the worst either.  There was a strange layer of fat on top of the container of the mousse.  It came with some bread too. I really prefer softer bread than the hard bread that was given. \n\nI then ordered the 7x7 suggested item - the tonnarelli \"cacio e pepe\".  I should have taken the advice of some other yelpers and not necessarily ordered this item. It was really peppery by the end of the dish and definitely too creamy.  There was no real depth and flavor so each bite tasted the same and I wasn't entirely pleased. Not bad, but not great either. \n\nI wanted to try a dessert so I ended up ordering the chocolate torta.  This was chocolate cake with some delicious bourbon mousse. It was sprinkled with some olive oil and sea salt. I do like some salty aspects of my desserts, but I think I'm partial towards disliking olive oil in my desserts. Just not my thing. \n\nOverall, I had great service, was able to have a great dinner.  It wasn't too bad costwise, but I also decided not to get too many drinks.

We ate so much food...\n\nFor drinks, I had the License #1 which has apple brandy, rye, dolin blanc, cardamaro, and absinthe. Great if you are looking for a strong, solid cocktail. If you want something more refreshing and fruity, get the Rosso Rubino which has vodka, grapefruit, and fennel... I still think that fennel in a cocktail is a strange concept.\n\nAnyways, we started with the Fried Castelvetrano Olives and Locanda's Pizza Bianca, both of which I could not stop eating. The Jewish-Style Artichoke and Burrata were quite tasty too. I'm sure their menu rotates every few weeks or months, but if the Guinea Hen or Acqua Pazza is there, I would order that again. Otherwise, everything else we ordered was also delicious! Our smorgasbord included the Pancetta Casoncelli, Early Girl Tomatoes, and Garden Lettuces Misticanza.

Good food if you are more patient than we were.\n\nLocanda came highly recommended to us from a colleague in the restaurant industry. As a chef who studied in Rome, he referred to Locanda as the best Roman food in the states. We were looking to have dinner with a couple who lives in the area.\n\nMy girlfriend and I arrived at 7:30pm and checked in with the hostess ahead of our 8pm reservation. We went to the bar for drinks while we waited for our friends. The cocktails were delicious and the bar service very good.\n\nOur friends arrived at 8pm and we notified the hostess that we were ready to be seated. We were not seated more than a half-hour later. A waiter noted that we had been waiting for some time and was kind enough to bring us a couple of snacks, but still, this was a very long wait to be seated for a reservation.\n\nAfter being seated, I ordered a 2011 Piedmont wine for the table. The waitress brought out the 2012 vintage to serve, and when I asked for the 2011 vintage as was on the menu, she brought out the 2013 vintage. She then had a gentleman who was more familiar with the wine list come and help select an alternate wine (he was very helpful).\n\nWe waited at the table over 20 minutes before our order was taken by a different waitress.\n\nOur food came out relatively quickly after ordering and was good. We ordered two pastas (orecchiette and carbonara), the short ribs and an appetizer. The orecchiette was particularly well received. The pastas were cooked perfectly.\n\nWhile a waitress did come to check on us, she did not check on our wine glasses and I ended up pouring for the table. We had to ask the waitress to clear four glasses we had brought over from the bar.\n\nWe waited about 15 minutes between dinner clearing and when we had dessert menus. We ordered dessert (afogato and a cake-like dish that paired with a Jura wine) and a glass of grapa. The desserts and grapa arrived but the Jura was forgotten. We had to ask for the Jura and waited a little over 5 minutes for it to arrive.\n\nSadly, despite excellent food and drink, we left with a very negative impression of Locanda. We waited more than half an our for our reservation, we had a total of three waitresses weave in and out, we waited very long to order, a different wine was brought out from what we ordered and was on the menu, we waited a long time to order dessert, and overall the service was poor. We spent about $120 at the bar and about $280 at dinner. Based on our experience, we would neither return to Loconda nor recommend it to our friends.\n\nI shared my feedback with the manager who kindly offered to send me a gift certificate, however despite responding with my address I never heard back. The gift certificate wasn't necessary, but the gesture was enough for me to give the restaurant a second shot. That ship has sailed.", "author": "Jeff C. J."}

I'd heard a lot of hype and positive reviews and gorgeous intagram pics so I couldn't wait. \n\nI must say I was disappointed with the food. I'm a vegetarian so I'm wondering if because I wasn't able to order any of the meat I missed out, but I feel that it should be pretty easy to get an amazing pasta dish minus the meat. \nWhat we ordered: We started with the fried olives and the early girl tomato salad. They were both great, especially the tomato salad which had fennel, arugula, and crustini soaked in tomato juice. It was a great start, but the pastas were a let down. I got the cacio and pepe which is one of my all time favorites. I recognize that it's not the most exciting pasta dish and there isn't a lot to go off, but that should also mean it's really easy to get right since it's not very involved. However, it fell flat. It was lacking pepper and cheese--which is basically the entire dish. My friend ordered the linguine with anchovies and it was insanely fishy and the padron peppers totally dominated the lightness of the pasta. For dessert, we got the semifreddo which was good, but I didn't feel the need to finish it. \n\nOur waitress was great though! I brought my own wine and she commended me on my taste and talked about her knowledge of the vineyard and the vintage and made some recommendations based on the bottle. Additionally, my friend had almost half her pasta left over (saw a lot of comments about the portions being small but I thought they were perfect) and she asked to get a box. Somehow her box got thrown away and the waitress felt so bad she asked us to stay for a few minutes while the chef made her a new one. This was such a kind gesture and definitely not what we expected! \n\nI'd give Locanda another shot for brunch since I know it is very popular.

When you chill and slice it thin, beef tongue loses its intense rich beefy goodness and ends up tasting like a standard cold cut which is exactly what happened here.\n\n*Grilled Salmon Collar ($21) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/18kWrI2\nA special of the night, you can never go wrong with what the Japanese and many chefs coin as a prized part of the salmon. Simply grilled, the salmon collar's skin was crisp while the flesh was fatty and rich. Make sure to devour the fins too; they're like crunchy chips with a nutty flavor. I was hoping for an Italian twist to this popular Japanese dish but there wasn't, it was served with a side of olive oil, salt, and a chili sauce.\n\n*Burrata Cuscini w/ Lobster ($24) - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/13LZ9BL\nThe most highly anticipated dish of the night was also the biggest disappointment of the night. I adore burrata for its milky smooth, creamy consistency but the burrata cruscini was more like mini raviolis with no bite to it. The lobster chunks were cooked well but the sauce needed cream or something to boost the richness the burrata was lacking.\n\nWe also ordered the Leg of Lamb ($27) which Mr. NSS dug into before I could take a pic. I thought the dish would be more like a slowly braised lamb shank but it was sliced and served medium rare. Mr. NSS thought the lamb was just OK while I found it to be a bit chewy and underseasoned.\n\nS E R V I C E\nThe entire staff was awesome, friendly, and down to earth. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. Food service is slow when it gets busy so it's best to come for an early dinner.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nContemporary urban sheek meets country rustic vibe with a brown and ivory color scheme, an open kitchen, and wooden furnishings. Love it.\n\nLocanda is great for dates but make sure to come only with reservations. \n\nP A R K I N G\nValet parking is $12.\n\nWhile the food at Locanda is not worth coming for in my opinion, DO stop by for their amazing cocktails.

That said, I think it has lost something recently. \n\nThe first hint was that I was able to get a reservation on both a Friday and Saturday eve at 7:30, just the day before. Unheard of in the past. \n\nThe food was very good (Artichokes, Burrata, little gem salad dressed just right...). The concern for me was with the meal timing and the impact on the food, and our overall feeling of being rushed. \n\nI was dining with just my husband. We ordered three antipasto dishes and two pasta entrees. All three starters arrived at the exact same time. This meant that the burrata and artichokes were stone cold by the time we got to eating them. Again, both were delicious but less enjoyable because they sat in the table longer than they should have. The server brought our mains to the (small) table before we were completely done with the starters. This not only made for the awkward \"dish dance\" on the table, but the feeling again of being rushed. I should say at this point were we're only 30 minutes in on the meal. We weren't lingering. \n\nI think Locanda's strength is their pasta dishes. Both were very good (I had the Lobster, my husband had the Lamb ragu). The disappointment came with the fact that  lamb dish did not taste as if it was freshly made, rather that it was kept warm for an extended period of time, except that it was Luke warm and lacked that \"just out of thee kitchen\" freshness. My Lobster pasta was fine. \n\nOn the plus side, our waitress was very good, the cocktails were also very good, and their wine selection was superb (if not a little pricey). \n\nAll in all, we expect more for the cost and certainty for the reputation. We will certainty go back with the hope that our recent experience was an exception rather than the new rule. Past meals have been quite good. I will update this review when we do.", "author": "Janet P."}

Neither was very flavorful and we were a bit disappointed.  At over $30 per entree, we expected more!\n\nWe thought we could end the meal on a better note by ordering dessert, and decided to share the cherry tronchetto.

I know it's sister restaurant to Delfina, a restaurant I adore, and I'd always heard excellent things. But after last night, all I can say is \"meh.\"\n\nAdmittedly there were a few contributing factors as to why I wasn't as impressed as I could've been. \n\n#1 - Our reservation was set for 8pm, and we weren't seated till 8:30pm. I understand things happen, so my date and I just ordered a couple cocktails at the bar: the Camelot (gin, cynar, cucumber, lemon) and the Emmanuel II (bourbon, nardini, cappelliti, lemon), both of which were tart, balanced and delicious. Honestly some of the best drinks I've had at any restaurant in the city. Also, the bartenders were incredibly attentive and gracious, and provided us with some of the best service of the evening.\n\n#2 - We booked during SF Restaurant Week. The $40 dinner menu on the website advertised such tantalizing items as an anchovy appetizer with lemon and parm, as well as a Dungeness crab pasta with fennel and uni butter (I checked the menu again the morning of my dinner and these dishes were still listed; as of today -- perhaps after our conversation with their GM -- it has been updated). My boyfriend and I sat down having already decided what we were going to order, only to discover that the anchovy app had been replaced by a garden salad and cauliflower soup. In lieu of the crab pasta, meanwhile, was a pork saltimbocca.\n\nAgain, I know that there's a disclaimer saying the menu is subject to change. But I couldn't help feeling a little bit swindled? The hostess and GM were incredibly nice and professional about the whole thing, but noted there wasn't anything they could do. Regardless it left us with a bad taste in our mouths.\n\n#3 - Our waiter seemed kind of aloof. He was nice and kept our water filled, but would neglect to take away empty glasses or plates for awhile, or get us going onto our next course. He also tried to give us the wrong check at one point, lol. Not a huge negative, as I don't think his heart was in a bad place, but he did seem kind of ditzyish?\n\n#4 - All that aside, the food was hit or miss. The burrata on grilled pizza was kind of bland -- and trust me, I'm a HUGE burrata fan. The pork saltimbocca, on the other hand, was far too salty, and the meat was tough. The mushroom tortellini was the highlight of my evening: stuffed with goat cheese, flavorful and rich. I just wish there were more mushrooms.\n\nThe desserts (black pepper wine granita, and chocolate cake with kumquat gelato) were also wonderful. Wildly creative and not too sweet.\n\nOur whole meal ended up coming out to about $140 including 2 cocktails each + tip which seemed overpriced given our mediocre experience. All in all, while I enjoyed certain parts of the evening, I don't know that I'm in a hurry to ever return (except for a drink).", "author": "Tiffany W."}

The staff handled it very well by checking in with us from time to time and offering the fried olives (which were delicious) to snack on while we waited. \n\nThe pizza bianca is not a flatbread with cheese (for all you CPK and Cheeseback Factory lovers) - it is a crisp bread with olive oil and some seasoning. Maybe it was because I was starving, but it was a great starter. \n\nThe pasta came out immediately upon finishing the pizza bianca. We didn't even have time to order wine first, which was kind of annoying. But the server was excellent at quickly coming over to us and getting wine to us, so we weren't without anything to drink with the course for more than a few minutes, at most. \n\nThe pasta is legit. Cooked to perfection. Both the guinea-hen pancetta casconelli and the bellwether crescenza tortelli were delicious - not too saucy, but very flavorful. \n\nIf you're craving fancy pasta, this is the place to go.

But that was my takeaway from a dinner last night at Locanda. It was almost completely note-perfect. We started with a fantastic bottle of Chenin Blanc, and that set the tone right away. Then the food started coming and it was accompanied by our oohs and ahhs.\n\nSTARTERS:\nJewish artichoke - an artichoke completely fried so that the whole thing is edible. And it was delicious!\nLIberty Duck ciccioli - flavorful shredded duck (maybe it had been confited?), with arugula, and the amazing pizza bianca (bread). The duck had so much rich flavor. It was really wonderful.\nPizza bianca - one of the best starter breads ever. Olive oil so good it tastes like butter, and sea salt. Delicious.\n\nDINNER:\nCauliflower soup - I wasn't terribly hungry, so between the apps and the sides, this was my \"meal.\" It was incredibly good soup - smoky, rich, and gone in a few seconds.\nShort rib cappelleti - my friend's husband's pasta. It had celery and cocoa nibs in it, which added some cool flavors and textures. The tortellini-like pasta filled with short ribs was amazing. Clearly, they put high-quality meat in this pasta. \nOrecchiette - my friend's pasta. House made sausage, broccoli raab, and capers meet housemade pasta in another winning dish. The flavors, like everything else, went together perfectly. I am so glad my friends liked to share!\nBrussels sprouts - roasted well, with delicious crumbly bits of pancetta.\n\nDESSERT:\nBaba Rum Tropicale - my choice and the only thing that didn't wow me. It was good - but not fantastic. A sweet syrupy mix of pineapple and mango sauce, with whipped mascarpone and some type of sweet bread (maybe a brioche?).\nChocolate budino - beautiful chocolate, great vanilla ice cream. Simple, yet right.\nHazelnut finanzario - the winner of the desserts. Crumbly financiers, sitting in a pool of candied pear sauce and the incomparable candy cap gelato. (If you don't know what candy caps are, you'll be even more amazed after you have the gelato and then do a Google search. You would never guess that THAT is the flavor in this gelato.)\n\nAll in all, a wonderful meal. I will be back.", "author": "David B."}

Or maybe I had high expectations because it is the sister restaurant of Delfina, but I was so not impressed with the food at Locanda. \n\nWe started off with the prosciutto, which came with about 8-10 slices and warm, soft, lightly salted bread drizzled with olive oil. Not a bad start. \n\nNext, we decided to share 2 pasta dishes: fettuccine with chicken-prosciutto meatballs and rigatoni alla carbonara. Portions were on the small side, and the taste did not make up for it. Meh. The fettuccine was the better of the two - perfectly cooked pasta and tasty meatballs, but the chicken and prosciutto flavors weren't very distinguishable. I was really excited to try the carbonara, but was left disappointed. The pasta seemed undercooked, the consistency of the sauce was not creamy (almost like it was left out too long), and the guanciale was way too salty. \n\nThe service was great, but the food won't bring me back.

She informed us \"actually that she had a really tight schedule and it really wouldn't work.\" No problem!  \n\nWe were seated immediately and with in less than 10 seconds of getting our menu, A server came to our table and asked us if we were ready, \"ready for a drink I thought?\"  We had decided at that point to go ahead and get a bottle of wine as we were celebrating.  I informed our server that I had a few in mind, but I would value her opinion on my selection based on our menu choices.  I never got this opinion. \n\nAfter we asked for a few minutes to decide,  A gentlemen sat down next to us, ended up sharing his entire appetizer with us, getting a cocktail and having his second course--***before*** our waitress came back to take our drink order--- roughly 20 min in a completely empty 610 crowd, not including bar. \n\nSo the food--- I ordered our appetizers of cauliflower soup and a puntarelle salad (Caesar) to be split--- they brought both apps out completely separate; they did not split them per our request.  Fine, but we did ask:(  when the appetizers were dropped off our glasses were completely empty ---  neither the server nor the food deliverer filled up our glasses of wine. Also, not a big deal, but this place demands this level of service as their cheapest bottle is roughly 50$. \n\nFood: Salad was amazing, crunchy, not too much anchovy, nice tang but rounded and did I mention crunch!! Well done chef--- also the cauliflower soup was superb with salted capers, olive oil and a delectable (would argue it is not vegan) creaminess that makes you feel warm in foggy San Francisco. \n\nNext the entr\u00e9e was delivered and the server delivered it conveniently separated, however, it was the same pasta dish, same portion??? --- meaning they screwed up our order.  She informed us that would promptly deliver our other entree so we could eat together, oops--- We both finished our initial pasta, not empty plates but wanting to save room, when they dropped off the other pasta dish, Cacio de pepi, not separated and I actually had to grab his arm to suggest boxing other meal so that we had room to eat. The tortellini was terribly salty and we both felt we could not taste the butter sauce, promised mushroom winter flavor and our toasted pine nuts were completely washed out by the salt!!!  Yikes, I am southern but, sad:(  and I make fresh pasta every week and am in awe of greatness--- not. Greatness. The Cacio de pepi was chewy but sauce was superb.  \n\nLastly, we went for a meringue dessert-- sugar that melts on tongue is a better description!!  No.\n\nThey also did not being our dessert wine pairings, but quickly took the uneaten dessert away, no question as to why we didn't eat it and no question as to where our $8x2 dessert wine pairing was?  \n\nWe informed our server and she said, \"I am sorry you found this sub par.\" They comped an entree and took off the dessert, but an apology and a let's try again would have been much nicer plus hey, what a it that dessert wine? \n\nDon't review much but honestly tired of extreme prices for \"your welcome to be here\" and a  \"ugh welcome to our restaurant\" attitude--- not to mention the \"we're so busy pushing people through here, no! We cannot accommodate your cocktail.\" Also, we had to ask our server for our boxed up to go food bc they forgot:( \n\nSo, I don't know why everyone loves this place, but I think there is impeccable Italian, friendly service, a manager that apologizes directly-- plenty more for your 150$ plus Thursday night in San Francisco!  \n\nLike puerto allegre across the street!!", "author": "Bonnie Marie J."}

What do you know? it's our lucky night! \n\nI should probably be sick of pasta after two weeks in Italy, but the pasta was calling my name. Locanda's carbonara will transport you back to Rome: guanciale, pecorino and black pepper. A bit too much on the pepper, but I like that they use real egg to make your pasta really creamy and as expected, the pasta itself is done exceptionally well!  My friends loved their chestnut and sage agnolotti, so maybe I'll try that next time.\n\nThe Jewish style fried artichoke is a nod towards Venice's influence and I can't complain! The pizza bianca is more of the crunchy pizza instead of thin style.\n\nNow, their cocktails! Remembering that Aperitivo cocktail makes me lick my lips twice, I sooo want to prolong the memory! it's made with Campari, orange, lemon and topped off with prosecco. The bitterness of the Campari with the acidity from the citrus and dryness from the prosecco is the perfect palette opener. While the Smoke and Spice is a manly man's and will warm you through with gin, vermouth and scotch.\n\nWe had multiple people serving us, bringing entrees and clearing plates.

They're Roman inspired dishes that are completely different from our typical pizza/meatballs Delfina dinner nights. Sam works here now so we thought we'd give her a visit and try the dishes. We had a 5:30pm reservation. We got there 15 minutes early so we decided to walk around. We got to the door and the line was long! Turns out, it wasn't just us who made the 5:30 reservations.

My BF loves to eat so we always order in bulk. Lol. We started with the Fried Olives, Earl grey tomato salad, Fried Bokchoy & La Quercia Prosciutto served with their famous pizza Bianca (aka bread). All these came out beautifully. Each dish has its distinct taste. For entrees: we had the Lamb Ragu and the Lamb Scottadito. Sam also gave us a taste of their Cornish hen and sausage pasta. WOW. Incredible. The pastas here for sure are a Must. For desserts: we had the CHOCOLATE BUDINO (lady fingers, Marsala zabaglione, salted chocolate gelato) & APPLE ALMOND TORTA (nocino milk jam, figs, pink pearl apple sorbetto) aka bread pudding - their version. Both were super delicious - my BF and I inhaled each plate. I have to say though: from the friendly staff, the romantic ambience, the delicious, well balanced meals, yummy cocktails and the super sweet Manager they have (Sam - she's quite attentive and knows how to take care of her customers very well) this place deserves a medal for overall top performance. This is definitely a good spot for a night with some friends or a nice date night with your beau. We will definitely come back!! For our friend Sam - the restaurant looks amazing! We're so happy for you. This place ROCKS.", "author": "Anna Y."}

I'm glad that out of all in the Mission, my cousin and I went to this one. \n\nProbably wouldn't have gone here if my doctor didn't give me a generous Christmas gift card and it was for my cousin's birthday, for as many people in the city, I'm content with a burger and some tacos at a bar down the street from my house. But, thankful to explore the culinary finds of the city!\n\nThis place is pretty and simple on the outside, just a sign and curtains to cover the windows, Urban Outfitters/Pottery Barn/ Simple Pinterest Chic on the inside. They have  a beautiful bar to to welcome you to the establishment, and a crazy tree with glass bubble chandelier thing as the centerpiece to their cozy restaurant. Would suggest this place for intimate gatherings among friends, and dates as well! Can get a little loud inside because the place is small and people are drinking and going off on wine tastings.\n\nNote: Make reservations! Helps us out a lot, since it can be a full house. \n\nWe tried a few of their wines, and got a couple of glasses. I am more of a beer person, so my knowledge of wine is very limited. I appreciated the waitresses recommendations, who had pretty accurate descriptions of what we were tasting.\n\nYou are automatically greeted at the table with some water from their fancy logo covered bottles and some butter cheesy bread to start. My cousin got their red snapper special and I got the lamb chops. The special was the whole fish, and was more and enough for my and my cousin. Extremely flavorful, filled with veggies and seasonings. Amazingly light and filling all at the same time. The lambchops were amazing! IF I went here again I would get the chops. Came with greens and a chickpea blended sauce which complimented the meat and greens well.\n\nFor dessert, my cousin and I shared the passion fruit tart with the banana ice scoop. Maybe because I have the sweetest tooth ever, this was my favorite part of the meal. The crust was buttery and flaky, with the tart balancing it out, and the ice cream to bring it awn down. So good! Also came with a candle melted on the plate for the birthday girl. \n\nThe service was attentive and extremeley helpful considering that we weren't familiar with the cuisine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-14", "description": "Mediocre, overpriced food, tiny portions, pretentiously difficult-to-translate menu, and waitstaff that is never around when you need your water filled up, but plops the bill on your table before you're done eating your dinner and then visits your table every 30 seconds after that to nudge you to pay said bill...A huge disappointment!!\n\nMy partner and I went here for our anniversary.  The interior decor was pleasant and the noise level reasonable enough to have a good conversation without shouting.  I was sure I'd picked the right place.\n\nWe started with the \"Sonoma\" Lamb Carpaccio (with puntarelle, salt - packed capers, parmigiano).  It was tasty once I added some salt, and this was the highlight of our dinner.  \n\nWe moved on to the Pizza Bianca...which was not a pizza of any sort.  It was toast with a veeeeeery thin, tasteless scraping of pureed garbanzo peas and almost indiscernible shaving of tuna essence with a drizzle of lemon oil.  The taste was so subtle that there almost wasn't any.  Again, this required salt to be palatable, and at around $9, I couldn't believe I'd just paid that much for toast with half a teaspoon of bland hummus!\n\nFor my main course, I ordered the Rigatoni Carbonara.  I love usually love carbonara, it's something I often order at restaurants...and it rarely disappoints.  I hate the flavor of black pepper, however, so I specifically asked them to refrain from adding that atop my dish before serving.  When it arrived, guess what was heavily smattered all over my pasta?!  Needless to say, I didn't feel at all bad about immediately returning the dish to the kitchen, since I was really clear about this when I ordered, and it was a make-or-break issue for me.\n\nMy partner had ordered the Radiatore Pecora E Pecorino (pasta with  lamb ragu, pecorino, mint), which was tasty, but the portion was tiny!  At almost $20 for a bowl of pasta, you expect to be presented with an ample portion...but apparently this is one of those newfangled restaurants where you HAVE to order and consume all three courses of dinner, or you'll still be hungry when you're finished!!\n\nMy partner and I nibbled at his dish until mine returned from the kitchen, this time sans pepper.  No one offered us any grated cheese to sprinkle on top of our pasta.  That should've been my first warning.  This \"carbonara\" tastes NOTHING like any carbonara I've ever had!!!  It was bitter, bland, and in a thick, frothy sauce that I was informed is pre-made (ie, not to order).  Um, Locanda, that's NOT carbonara!!!  There was no buttery flavor, thick egginess, delicious saltiness, or anything else I've come to expect and enjoy from a pasta carbonara!  If you are used to ordering spaghetti carbonara in Italian restaurants, be warned that this is not what you'll get at Locanda!\n\nTo help you understand how bad the taste was, my partner saw my crest-fallen face and quickly offered to trade dishes with me (yes, this was incredibly sweet of him!).  I gratefully accepted his offer, and while he admitted the carbonara was a definite disappointment, he didn't find it as inedible as I did.\n\nWe both finished our miniscule pasta portions, and hastily ordered dessert, for me, the TCHO CHOCOLATE-CUSTARD BUDINO  ( with nocino dulce de leche, walnuts, cocoa nib croccante).  This was basically a gelatin-like custardy mass atop a thin round of cake with a tiny pile of candied walnuts and candied cocoa nibs with a spoon of super-foamy whipped cream.  Again, I was disappointed.  Tcho is my favorite brand of chocolate and I'm VERY familiar with all the milk and dark varieties, of which I partake regularly.  Sadly, this confection barely tasted of chocolate at all, leaning heavily instead on the sweet, thin caramel flavor.  My partner tasted my dessert and agreed.  For $9, this was an overpriced, tremendous let-down.\n\nAbout two seconds after we received our dessert, the female server plopped the bill down on the table with a saccharin smile.  She then proceeded to revisit our table EIGHT TIMES over the next ten minutes in an attempt to see if we had put a credit card down yet.  Um, we weren't finished with dinner!!!  This is not some dive-y diner, this is supposed to be the latest hipster-foodie incarnation of fine dining...so it is INCREDIBLY RUDE to pressure diners to pay the bill before they are done with dinner.  When you've ordered a bottle of bubbly and your bill is $130 for two people, you expect a little patience and good service to enjoy your meal.  If the server was waiting to get off of her shift, that's one thing...but SAY that, don't keep nudging us passive-aggressively.  \n\nAfter we paid, any and all service stopped to our table abruptly.  Our server never came back to us, not even to offer to retrieve my coat, which she'd insisted on taking when we sat down.  Oh, well.", "author": "Amy L."}

It was the table in the window, which got pretty chilly.\n\nI can't remember what my friends ordered but two of us shared the lamb carpaccio, and two pastas. The warm pizza bianca was pretty good but the lamb carpaccio tasted too greasy - not sure if it was from the meat or the added olive oil. One pasta was with dungeness crab, the other I think was the lamb ragu. I sampled a couple of my friends dishes as well, including another pasta dish. The texture of the pasta was soft and overcooked for one of the dishes, and undercooked and hard for another. I prefer my pasta just a touch softer than al dente but I think only one of the pastas was in the realm of al dente. I did enjoy the flavor of the pasta dishes, but the ragu was very salty and the crab pasta did not have very much crab in it.\n\nThe friends I went with love this place but the two of us first timers were not impressed.

Here was how it went:\n\nThe CSO of my company took me out for a birthday dinner. His first choice of course would've been Zuni's but since they weren't open on Mondays, we settled for his other favorites. Here at Locanda.\n\nPARKING:\nNormally parking in San Francisco is horrid. Since Dr. Jorge Garcia (Doc) made reservations, we decided to do the valet thing (when I said, 'we' I really meant 'he' -i would've gotten there 30 minutes early and drove around looking for parking). $12.\n\nLOCATION:\nAt 6P, the place had nice tall windows which you can see the inside. It was well lit with yellow lighting; already alluring my senses to it (Doc sure knows how to pick it). I couldn't wait to get inside.\n\nINTERIOR:\nWe entered a cute little modern day interior and furnishings The tiles on the walls, hanging lighting fixtures, well lit (but not crazy lit where you felt everyone is staring at you) and quiet conversations amongst the groups that was dining there (minus us -I think we were a bit loud- well, I was probably).\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nIt wasn't crazy busy so we were able to pick any table upon our arrival. Doc liked the idea of being able to stare outside the window (I guess just in case I was boring to converse with or something hehee). We were greeted by a pretty waitress who seems to be really drained of energy or something (couldn't seem to crack a smile). I didn't think much of it at the beginning figured she's probably be a hard nut but will crack eventually. Unfortunately, the entire time she was serving us, not a single smile (hence, the four stars).\n\nFOOD:\nWas I surprise that the food was delicious? Nope. Doc's taste in food is impeccable and I trust his selection 110%. (let's see if I have this right...) We had the Coppiette, Burrata, Bellwether Crescenza Tortelli, Liberty Duck Breast and Brussels Sprouts. These selections weren't exactly the healthiest, but definitely full of flavor. I do not believe there was a single dish that was unsatisfying (compliments to the chef, er chefs).\n\nVERDICT:\nThe food was delish! Unfortunately, my income doesn't allow me to splurge on such quality foods, but it is definitely great for a dinner date. I recommend you to at least try this spot once.

The reason for the 2 stars is because frankly, I still love their food. But given SF is full of stellar Italian places, and Valencia is one of the best dining streets, the horrible service is a dealbreaker. GO ELSEWHERE.\n\nGranted, we had a party of 6. But we paid for that by having a late reservation (8:30) on a Monday night (end of a long weekend).\n\nWe had to wait 33 minutes for the table. Literally, we stood at the bar. For 33 minutes. We checked with the hostesses 3 times and at no point in time did they offer us drinks or even bread at the bar despite the fact that it was getting close to 9PM and any normal person would have been STARVING.\n\nThe waitress tried to push drinks on us twice.  Jeez, we're tired and starving, we dont want drinks! and she then took 24 minutes to bring out the one non alcoholic drink someone ordered. Literally, my friend's tea came out right before entrees. Nice job there. What were you doing? Collecting the firewood and building a fire to heat it up in the kitchen? We got the bread pretty fast, thank god. But it had such deep pockets of oil that I had to request paper napkins to damp them. It was like getting a pepperoni pizza from little Caesars. Come on.\n\nThe staff did try to \"make it up\" to our group by giving out freebies of probably leftovers in the kitchen. Fried olives. And then fried onions. First off, we didn't come to an Italian restaurant to eat fried food. And secondly, olives and onions? Seriously? Thanks for the \"effort\". The olives remained untouched because frankly, none of us like olives. We ate the onions because the portions for our entrees were so small that a couple ppl were still hungry afterwards. \n\nWe ordered the fettuccini with rabbit (delicious but the portion was so small it didn't even cover the bottom of the plate), rigatoni carbonara, lamb ragu, smoked salmon salad, and a beans appetizer. Again, LOVE the food here. Can't get enough.\n\nIt took about 20 minutes after our meal ended to get out of there. No wonder the group before us were delayed by 33 minutes.

That fried artichoke appetizer though...just do what everyone says and order it. Also tried the veg/ricotta salad, which wasn't much of a salad, didn't bother me though!\n\nAlso tried the carbonara - I never want bacon any other way. Seriously, how do they do it?! The sea bass was also lovely. Definitely didn't need dessert but in the spirit of the weekend, opted to split the chocolate budino = love at first bite.\n\nLoved locanda and hope to be back soon!", "author": "Brianna M."}

We loved the ambiance and thought that the service was gracious and effective without being intrusive.\n\nThe room is pretty loud; the four of us had to raise our voices in order to carry on a conversation.\n\nI liked everything that I ate and drank, with the possible exception of the \"bread,\" which I experienced as pieces of greasy fried pastry that were delivered to us piping hot and dripping with oil.  (Has the baguette lost its mojo?)  I ate four or five slices of the greasy \"bread,\" so you can infer that I made my peace with it.\n\nI drank two \"on tap\" wines by Sheldon of Sonoma.  (The \"Fearless Leader & Sippy Director\" of the winery is named Tobe Sheldon.)  The wines were a chardonnay and a cabernet -- I liked both of them and didn't detect any off-taste from the tap.  I ordered an \"corrected\" affogato as dessert and imbibed further alcohol because of the correction.  The affogato was delicious and made me happy.  (I tend not to eat many desserts.)\n\nThe food:\n\nAs a starter, I had the chilled nervetti with celery hearts, Calabrian chili and Buddha's hand.  Only when I placed the order did I find out that nervetti are what our server called beef tendons; online, I find the definition \"pressed beef cartilage\".  I'm not normally a cartilage guy, but the salad was wonderful!  I thought that the chili worked very well with the other components of the dish.\n\nI went with the Berkshire pork spareribs as my main dish -- this was the top recommendation of our server.  I liked the ribs and wish that there had been more of them.  Next time, however, I'll try something different.\n\nThere will definitely be a next time!  We liked Locanda and would be happy to return with friends.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

Initially I had gotten a reservation somehow that was a week before they were open. Annie Stoll herself gives me a call notifying me with the mistake. Damn, I guess I couldn't sneak into the staff training dinner :) She however let me have the pick of any spot on opening night so I rescheduled to be in the thick of it.\n\nLarger and much more bustling that the many times I'd been to Delfina, the atmosphere was definitely abuzz and many were our and dressed to impress. The space is a mix of rustic and modern. Behind the host station is a small seating lounge which opens up to a bar area, with a long bar along the front left of the restaurant, followed by the pass and half of the kitchen which is open. A number of tables surround the back adjacent to a service station and the closed part of the kitchen and plating counter.\n\nAs we arrived sharp for our resys, a bevy of attractive hostesses seated us by the kitchen. Now I never went to Ramblas but I remember the previous space, Pinxtos, and realized I was sitting in the exact same area when I was here years ago. Weird deja vu! \nAfter receiving our beverages and perusing the menu we ended up with:\n\n-Chinotto\n-AGRO UVE - Grappa, Peach, Lemon, Egg, Bitters\n-PIZZA BIANCA - mortadella \n-SHORT RIBS - Chinotto marinade\n-TRIPPA - tomato, mint, and pecorino\n-NERVETTI - Arugula salad\n-SWEETBREADS - Fried artichokes\n-TONNARELLI CACIO e PEPE - pecorino, black pepper, basta\n-BUCATINI all'AMATRICIANA - guanciale, tomato, peperoncini, pecorino\n-GULF SHRIMP AND BURRATA MEZZASOLE\n-BAVETTE STEAK - radicchio Trevisano\n-RHUBARB MARMALATA CROSTATA -buckwheat struesel, fior di latte gelato\n-SANT'ANDREA MEZZANO - cow's milk (Friuli)\n-CANESTRATO DI MOLITERNO - sheep's milk (Basilicata)\n-2006 Sergio Mottura \"Muffo\", Lazio, Italy\n-Amaro Lucano\n\nThey're definitely killing it at Locanda. Everything we had was stellar. I'd say I enjoyed this more than the various Delfina trips (though I will always have a soft sport for the Tripe dish there more). We  had a huge spread and still so many more things I wanted to try. As Roman influence goes on Italian cuisine, you don't see it all that often here and SPQR, Ideale, Lupa and Delarossa maybe the only other significant plays in that arena. All of our servers were awesome and took great care of us. On top of that, there were definitely some lookers (especially our own Ruby!). It was hardly noticeable that they had just opened. The flow was very well maintained. A new winner in the ever popular and crowded dining scene in the Mission.", "author": "Kim N."}

The server forgot our bread but other than that no matter how busy that restaurant got everything was piping hot and brought out when it needed to be.  Water glasses remained full and we never poured our own wine.\n\nWe got a little bit of everything on the menu.  I wouldn't recommend the $21 \"OXTAILS alla VACCINARA\".  It was not as flavorful/different as our waiter described. I would say it's closer to a family pot-roast that mother's make at home than a restaurant quality meal.  It was edible but didn't look it. When the bread finally did arrive it went perfectly with our Poached Duck Egg & Asparagus.  And the simple light dish that was the CARCIOFI CRUDI was perfect for cleansing our pallets in preparation for the homemade pastas.  I would HIGHLY recommend the CUSCINI - Gulf shrimp blended into raviolis on top of burrata pillows. Magnificently done.\n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful and the bathrooms are well designed with communal faucets joining the two. A+ for design an layout of the space.

For my table of four, that was almost everything on the menu. \n\nApparently, you haven't truly dined Roman-style until you order Tonnarelli Cacio e Pepe, a classic dish which consists of only four ingredients: pasta (tonnarelli), Pecorino Romano, cracked pepper and salt. As simple as this dish is, it was one of my faves of the evening. We also rounded out our meal with grilled pizzas, the whole fish of the day, and Jewish-style artichokes. My ignorant palate was introduced to sunchokes earlier this year on a Texas farm, and since then I've been kinda obsessed with the many ways you can eat these healthy lil' suckers. But fried? As they Roman's call it, \"Carciofi Alla Giudia\" was uh-maze. \n\nService was superb, atmo was unique, and the open kitchen delivered a nice dose of energy into our dining experience.

The service, needless to say, was superb.

Perfect.\nPancetta-Wrapped Mary's Chicken - the pancetta was crispy and the chicken was so moist. \nSide: Roasted Brussel sprouts w/ Prosciutto (this was my friend's favorite dish)\n\nDESSERT (everyone was stuffed but we ordered it anyways).

I've lived here for 6 months and I guess I should take a hint and lower my expectations.  I came here at 12:45 for a reservation and the hostess told us we could wait at the bar.  15 minutes later she asked if we just wanted to eat at the bar since our table wasnt ready.  There was only 1 seat available so we declined.  Also that's why we made a reservation why would we want to eat at a bar with no chairs available. Moving on we ordered the eggs and purgatory and a sticky bun.  We asked for our sticky bun first and it never came. We got the egg dish and both me and my friends eggs were completely raw.  They apologized and remade them.  They also said we could have a round of bellinis on them which was nice.  An hour later we never got our sticky bun and cancelled the order.  The waitress seemed very green and was surprised our order didn't come (isn't that your job??).  All in all food was just ok but won't be back since the price point doesn't match the crappy service.", "author": "Diana D."}

Our waiter Justin was fantastic; he helped us navigate through the drinks menu, and his recommendations did not disappoint. We tried the set menu as well as off of the regular menu, and spent dinner arguing whose dish was the best. Personally, I think it was mine - the tortellini, which would just melt in my mouth. One of the better burratas we've had and a unique cauliflower soup. The desserts were also stellar. The weakest part of the meal was the saltimbocca - not the meat itself, but the side dish of greens, which was presented as a pile on an additional plate, almost like an attempt to make you feel healthier since you just got a dinner plate full of meat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-24", "description": "I came here twice in one weekend.\n\n\nFIRST TIME (5 stars)\nA dear friend recently got engaged, so to celebrate, we met up here for cocktails and dessert. The place was packed, even on a Thursday night, and we were told it would be a 45-min wait for a table at the bar. However, we ended up only waiting 20 mins, so yay! \n\nWe got The Bad Seed, Business Thyme, Hemingway and Il Profesionale (for drinks), and the Warm Chocolate Cake (for dessert). The cocktails here are absolutely gorgeous. Pretty colors served in old-fashioned, speakeasy-era martini glasses. They make you feel like Daisy Buchanan (that's a Great Gatsby reference for those of you who got more useful college degrees than English Lit). Thyme is one of my favorite herbs, so I'd definitely recommend the Business Thyme if you're into that. Otherwise, The Bad Seed is great for that fruity, citrusy flavor with a little bit of agave. The chocolate cake was a dream. Perfectly moist, warm, soft cake served with earl grey, almond and cocoa nib croccante and cool, creamy almond milk gelato. A fantastic combination of the traditional with a unique, creative twist.\n\nOur server was very attentive and friendly, yet understood when to leave us alone (two girls discussing one's upcoming wedding = many, many hours of girly chatter).\n\n\nSECOND TIME (3 stars)\nA couple of days after my first visit, I was entertaining a good friend who was visiting from Boston. Somehow, we wound up in the Mission that evening with one of her friends. They wanted booze, so I suggested Locanda, which was right around the corner and which I knew had great drinks and food.\n\nThis time, we were seated immediately. However, the cocktails were kind of a dud. In an attempt to try more things on the menu, I went with one of the cocktails with Campari in it (cant remember the name). I was assured by the waitress that it would be sweet, but upon tasting it...It most certainly was not. There was way, way, way too much Campari, making it extremely bitter. Now, I got my bartender's certification last year, so I know how to read a cocktail menu. I expected there to be some bitterness, but not that much. I ended up sending the cocktail back and asking for my friend's cocktail, The Aperitivo. It also had Campari, but it was much more diluted--way sweeter and far less bitter.\n\nFor entrees, I got the Bucatini all'Amatriciana. I have to say, I was really surprised and disappointed by how small the entree portions were. It wasn't possible to know that from my first visit, since we only ordered dessert. All of our entrees would easily be appetizers at a less fancy restaurant. The Bucatini was cooked well, with chewy al dente noodles and a creamy tomato sauce. However, the guanciale (unsmoked Italian bacon) was so salty, it actually hurt my teeth after a while. It was definitely a case of less is more.\n\nDespite the bad first cocktail and the disappointing portion sizes, I would have still given this second experience 4 stars if it weren't for one thing: our waitress. She was bad. Just bad. You ever go to a service place--like a restaurant, clothing store, etc.--and encounter that employee who's in a foul mood and just refuses to be friendly, gracious or even pleasant to talk to? They're not rude or insulting, just cold and unsmiling no matter how nice you are, and nothing you say will penetrate that icy exterior. Well, that was our waitress. If she'd hung a sign around her neck with \"I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE!!!\" written in neon pink, she couldn't have been more obvious about how unhappy she was to be working.", "author": "Josephine L."}

We ordered the prosciutto to go with the house bread (so deliciously light) as a starter.

Luckily for me we both have a similar sense of adventure when it comes to food so he trusted me to pick our meeting spot.\n\nWe were seated in the back dining area, right in front of the kitchen where the chefs were cooking our meals.  Perfect!  Tables were spaced fairly close to one another, but not so close that I could hear other conversations.  \n\nI started my meal with the mixed green salad with a balsamic vinaigrette.  The greens were fresh and greens were perfectly dressed.  My friend ordered one stick of the Coppiette, their version of pork jerky, and it was quite good.  You could tell high quality meat was used and the flavors of smoke and spice were pronounced, but not overly so.    He also ordered the carciofi crudi, a salad of artichokes, ricotta, arugula and avocado, a salad that he really enjoyed, and this is coming from someone that usually prefers foie gras to anything that grows out of the ground!  \n\nFor my entree I ordered the rigatoni alla carbonara, a typical Roman dish.  The sauce of egg, pecorino cheese, pepper and guanciale was delicious!  I used the focaccia (you have to ask for it and believe me you WANT to ask for it) to sop up some of this creamy and rich sauce.  For dessert I had the sheep's milk yogurt budino, which came with roasted strawberries and candied orange peel.  It was light, almost like a custard cake.  \n\nMany of the dishes looked so delicious that I would love to try all of them.  The Jewish style artichokes looked amazing and is something I would order on my next visit.   Portions are reasonable, as are the prices.  They make their own pasta and cure their own meats (they can be seen hanging in the kitchen).   They have a good selection of cocktails, beers and wines available.

Walked in for 6pm reservation and the place was already packed to the brim!

Starters prosciutto and fried olives were gobbled up in not time. Chicory salad had parts I couldn't chew and fried artichoke seemed rather small for $8 a piece, though did enjoy the little piece that I had.  Shared two entrees of pasta as primi -- they were small plates: rigatoni carbonera and a spaghetti tomato sauce dish that I forgot the name.  Rigatoni was a disappointment -- felt really heavy and just salty, but the bacon saved the dish. They were delightfully crunchy pork-belly like morsels that I couldn't get enough of. The other pasta dish had the same bacon in it, but not fried and didn't taste as yummy, but the pasta itself and suce was devine.\n\nLamp chops, steak and fish were all prepared quite nicely.  Bombolinis were good for dessert; cookie plate not as impressive and affogato got good reviews from our dinner companions. \n\nAll in all a great night out.  Good attentive service and great buzz in the restaurant.

This was definitely one of the five best meals I've ever had in my entire life, and for sure the best pasta I've ever had.  We called about 15 minutes before they opened and were able to score a reservation for right away.  I'm not sure if this is a place that tends to fill up quickly, but when we arrived, there was already a bit of a crowd waiting to get in.\n\nWe were seated in a corner table.  Our server was very friendly and great about explaining all of the specials and the menu.  To begin with, I had the Nonna Del Diavolo cocktail, which was delicious.  If you are a fan of Rye, I would give this a whirl.\n\nTo begin with, we had the radishes and anchovy butter.  Now, I've never had anchovies before, so I was a little nervous.  I must say, I was pleasantly surprised!  The anchovies gave the butter and radishes a nice umami flavor that really worked well!  \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the orecchiette with sausage, broccoli raab, capers, and cheese.  It was DELICIOUS.  The pasta was clearly made in-house, which I should have just assumed.  It was perfectly al dente.  I also tried my wife's short rib ravioli, and, let me tell you, words cannot describe how incredible it was.  Perfectly juicy and creamy.  I'm salivating just thinking about it.  \n\nTo end the evening we had a small cookie plate that was just the perfect size, not too big, not too small.

First off, they're also well-known for craft cocktails, and although I wasn't feeling like one on this particular evening, my husband did try their Nonna Del Diavolo (rye, strega, ginger, lime, seltzer), which was excellent. As a starter, we got the radishes with anchovy butter, which we really enjoyed. Radishes with butter and salt are undeniably trendy right now, but I still liked it, and thought the riff with anchovies was a cool twist and not something I would have thought of. We also tried the roman-style pork jerky, which is cured in Campari, so you know it's gotta be good - it was. Very unique and worth trying for just $2.50 a piece. \n\nMy husband had an orecchiette dish with sausage and greens, which was wonderful - you just can't beat homemade pasta like that. But the real star of the show was my entree, the short rib ravioli, on this particular night served in a sunchoke velutato sauce. THIS is a meal I will also remember and as I said earlier, the best pasta dish I've ever had. Their menu changes frequently, but I highly recommend trying anything dish with short ribs - they were perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth tender. Portions are smaller than what you'll get at most places, but this is a quality over quantity kind of place IMO, and the quality was superb. I left feeling full but not overly stuffed.\n\nFor dessert we shared the cookie plate - a nice, light bite after a heavier dinner.

The chefs have put immense efforts to ensure each dish has unique ingredients that artfully compliment the other flavors in the dish, keep the menu fresh & interesting, and make for a superb delivery!   I don't exaggerate or hyperbole when I say there is a superb delivery here----  to put it lightly, the food kicks ass here in a way so many other would-be fine/semi-fine dining restaurants cannot add up to.\n\n   So often, after I pay the huge bill of some fine restaurant, I think something like, \"Well, that was pretty good... not exactly amazing considering the price though!\"--- Locanda left my entire party talking about the food and how great it was.   There is also a bar which serves craft cocktails with skilled bartenders making the drinks, which adds to the fun.\n\nOf what we ordered, the most memorable dishes include (in English as I remember, not as written on menu): Green tomato soup, Lamb Ragu Orchiette pasta, Steak Au Jus ****MY FAVORITE*****,  Lemon/Garlic King Salmon, grilled little gem salad.  Friend loved the octopus but I don't like it, and the radishes in anchovy butter was a bit odd.... not my ideal item, but certainly memorable and different.\n\nDefinitely recommend you check out Locanda--- it's a hidden gem that deserves more recognition than it has gotten so far.", "author": "James M."}

There are about a million options for Italian food in SF and I was really underwhelmed with this meal. I went with four friends and we shared everything, the asparagus and brussels sprouts side dishes were far and away my favorite. The carbonara was just ok, the crab pasta was good but not great. I'm more than happy to spend a decedent amount of money on good food and good wine but I just feel like their food wasn't that great. \n\nThe waitstaff over all was nice and engaging. The sommelier, however, was a total pretentious prick. He could not have been less helpful. The wine list was comprised solely of Italian wines which is great, but not being as familiar with Italian wines we asked for help. He seem bothered to be at our table and kept making condescending comments; I was not a fan of his.\n\nOverall, ok food with a decent environment but with all the choices in SF this just did not hold up to the competition.

We have all come to expect incredible food quality, passionate creative chefs, and beautiful decor. But what has excited me the most the last couple years has been the focus on the little things, particularly the return of the well made cocktail. Yes, you can make your jokes about mixologists all you want, but the fact is that when you see your initial order (typically a drink) have meticulous detail and love poured into a glass, it sets your ego on fire and you begin your evening on cloud 9.\n\nLocanda, in my opinion, is the new bar that all others should strive to meet or exceed. Their service is Nordstrom like, with subtly like bar transfers to your table without asking, the drinks are surreal, the pastas are not earthly, and the service continues to surprise throughout the meal.\n\nDecor and atmosphere are perfect creating a lively ambiance.\n\nOh, and a wood fire grill in the open kitchen, fabulous!", "author": "Darin A."}

Appetizers were good, dessert was excellent, entrees bland and the service was not very good. Plus, our table was back in the corner, next to the arctic wind.\n\nThey wouldn't turnoff the A/C (even though it was 43 outside), so they threw a scarf over the vent on the floor under our table. This did nothing. I put my messenger bag and giant wool coat over it, which made it bearable. However the lip gloss in my coat pocket was frozen by the end of our meal. (Seriously)\n\nOur waitress was great when she was there, but that wasn't very often. We had to flag random people down for water (twice). It wasn't event full house - I think our spot in the frozen corner wasn't helping. \n\nConsidering all of the above plus how hard it was to get a reservation at a reasonable time, I won't be going back.", "author": "Rachel R."}

We sat down at precisely our reservation time, and were accosted (gently) by the waiters/waitresses seconds after each drink ran dry. An easy way to pay the bills Locanda! But the drinks were DELICIOUS, so I didn't mind...\n\nThe FOOD. \nFRIED OLIVES: meh. I had a different idea of what these would be like. It seemed very...frozen food section.\n\nJEWISH STYLE ARTICHOKE: an artichoke fried to the edge of burning. Very little flavor. More like a crispy, near-burnt, bunch of artichoke chips. Which is what it was. Poor ordering on our part. At $7 per tiny artichoke, not at all worth it. \n\nRIGATONI CARBONARA: decent, and with tiny bits of decadent guanciale (think delicious salty FAT with salty crispy bacon on top). It wasn't too soupy like others have described, but certainly wasn't up to Rome standards (but what can be?). We ate all of it. Rich and satisfying. \n\nBUCATINI AL AMATRICIANA: another Rome favorite - and again, what can live up to bucatini in Rome? This dish was again saved by the greedy bits of pork fat, which (what a surprise) can elevate just about any dish. \n\nOverall, decent service, not outstanding - good at refilling drinks but not at checking up on their patrons during the meal.

Anything that tastes equal to less good than decent Italian pasta from the supermarket prepared correctly with a decent sugo from a jar is not worth a restaurant visit or $17+ for a small plate. The \"RIGATONI alla CARBONARA - guanciale, Tully Dolci egg, pecorino, black pepper\" were undercooked, showed the hard edges that happen when you over-do the microwave and the sauce was curdled, almost dry-stuck and had an off taste - an absolute no-no. Al dente is right - \"al dentiste\" is too hard. The \"BELLWETHER CRESCENZA TORTELLI - chanterelle mushrooms, mint, pine nuts\" - easily went back as well uneaten; my daughter loves tortellini - she calls them \"huggies\" because they hug their \"arms\" - not these ones. I tried them - not something you want to eat.\n\nThe server was extremely supportive (as if she knew this may happen), took both Italian dishes back and brought me a great American style rare cooked steak - that was really good meat. She brought a big steak knife; 15 seconds later the next server took it away, the next server brought it again and I had a decent dinner. I was even asked if all was OK now. \n\nThere are many excellent Latino restaurants from basic to exclusive allover the Mission - make the pasta yourself and explore how great good pasta with simple ingredients can be at home.", "author": "Flo B."}

I declined her offer with a hope that the bread would neutralize the salty pork, but it didn't help. I managed to eat 1/3 and stopped. My friends didn't say much about their dish either.

The cocktail menu is famous, and is one of the most uninspiring famous cocktail menus I've looked at in a while.  We decided to try their \"flights\" of Negronis (aperol, luxardo, campari) and Old Fashioneds (rye, bourbon, scotch).  Two of them (aperol, and shockingly, scotch) were drinkable.  Everything else was unpleasant, some in interesting ways and some in uninteresting ways.  I felt like I'd just judged a mediocre episode of Top Chef: cocktail.\n\nWe expected to be a little more comforted by the food.  The halibut appeared to have once been a delicious piece of fish, rendered bland and uninteresting by its tour through the oven.  The borlotti beans were good, as borlotti beans are, but no better than the ones I make at home.  The pastas were pleasantly toothsome, but not terrible memorable.  A side of peas and shoots was treated as an afterthought.  \n\nThis surprisingly uninspiring array was accompanied by an even more uninspiring series of wine-pairings.  We wanted our server's advice.  We begged for our server's advice.  (If there's a sommelier around, he/she wasn't in evidence.)  Our server delivered up three glasses, one of which was so awful we rejected it out of hand, and most of which were shockingly unpleasant when paired with their suggested dishes.\n\nThe prices and the vibe suggest that you are in an excellent, trendy establishment.

The tripe was super  delicious and comforting. The tomato sauce that came with it was sooo yummy! They know how to make sauce ;) The texture of the tripe was perfect too; not too chewy.\nThe ricotta salad was good too but nothing special. I had also tried the oxtails and the fried sweetbread/artichokes, and both are wonderful.\n\nFor the primi, we split the linguini with the dungeness crab. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and it had a pretty good amount of crabs. However, this is not my favorite pasta dish in the menu. My favorite is probably the fettuccini with rabbit sugo. It was more flavorful because, again,  they know how to make sauce!\n\nAnd for my secondi, I had the fish. I don't remember exactly what kind of fish it was but it tasted great; cooked perfectly, crispy skin.

We got there around 6:30 on a Thursday night and lucked out because we only waited about 10 minutes before a couple left. \n\nThe food was delicious!\nWhat we ordered:\n1) Jewish artichokes - if you like artichokes, you will love this. Crispy and savory.\n2) Duck egg w/asparagus - My friend's fave dish. The egg was delightful and the butter sauce was good. Dip your bread in the leftover egg + sauce mixture. You won't be sorry.\n3) Pizza bianca. 3 choices but we got the one with califlower. Delish! A little spicy too which i enjoy. If you dont like spicy food, maybe you should get one of the others..\n4) Entree - Rigatoni alla Carbonara - Super rich. I mean, honestly, I couldnt finish it. It was sooo thick and meaty even though you couldn't really see the meat in it. I think it was the sauce. Really heavy and might make you sick if you eat it all. Just saying.\n5) Entree - Bavette Steak - $26?? Um sorry not worth the price. It was good, but not $26 good. Plus the sauce tasted like hot dog. Don't believe me? Try it. \n\nAll in all a good meal. Next time I go, i might pass up the entrees all together or at least try another pasta. The appetizers and small plates were the WOW-factor for me and this restaurant. Plus, with all the food we got plus 2 drinks ($10 each), the bill came out to $102 for 2 people!! Everything adds up. You order this and that and booom, a fatty bill so be careful.\n\nWill have to remove a star for the price. Sorry! :(\n\nBUT what I really really appreciated from this restaurant was the customer service. World class. The bartenders were really friendly and looked like they really really enjoyed making drinks :)\n\nAlso, as we were walking out, a gentleman stopped us and said that he worked for the sister restaurant Delfina and wanted to let us know that there was a stabbing in the area recently and wanted us to be safe. That made me feel really good because they honestly care for their patrons.", "author": "Cicely T."}

Words cannot describe how sad we were when the food came.  The portions are TINY TINY TINY and slopped into large paper takeout containers (no, not even the wax lined ones) that make them look even smaller.  Miniscule, beyond small portions.  The sauce soaked into the containers, so icky.  Food has never looked so pitiful.\n\nWe paid $70 for three dishes that would all fit on a single plate TOGETHER.  A cheapo lunch plate from any neighborhood Chinese place (two options and rice) gives you more food than OUR WHOLE MEAL.  Booooo.  We've never been so disappointed and mad when getting food from what's supposed to be one of the best restaurants in the city.  Sure, it's \"typical SF prices\" for the food, but each of the dishes is 50-70% smaller than a typical portion size is, even in SF.\n\nThe one pro is the taste...kinda.  We ordered an app: TRIPPA alla ROMANA, a pasta: RADIATORE \"PECORA e PECORINO, and a \"special\": BERKSHIRE PORCHETTA.  The radiatore tasted pretty good - the lamb was well cooked and tasty, the pasta was meh.  The porchetta too, though a bit fatty and not all that well composed.  You can't enjoy it much when there's just a bunch of fatty meat and nothing to balance it with.  And I like fatty meat.  I'd pass on the trippa next time...while the sauce was tasty and the tripe tender, you can only eat a couple bites before you don't want to have this anymore.\n\nSigh.  Locanda, we had high hopes, but you've let us down :(  You've got to put out larger portion sizes and pack your food in better containers.  We don't expect great value, but we do expect to be full at the end of the meal.\n\nYelpers - take my advice and go eat somewhere else if you are hungry.  If you want to try interesting Italian-inspired dishes and don't mind following it up with a real meal afterwards (burger, burrito, pizza, anything!), then head over to Locanda.", "author": "Connie L."}

The only thing I didn't like about it are the portions. Perhaps this is just the American in me speaking, always wanting more. I mean, I ordered 4 items (2 dishes and 2 beers) just for myself, and I wasn't really full. Basically what I am saying is that you might not be full after this meal so if you're super hungry--so plan accordingly.\n\nI ordered:\n1) Jewish Style Artichokes - Not worth it, nothing unique (maybe just an interesting presentation, but for sure not worth $8).\n2) Linguini (dungeness crab, lettuce and sorrel) - It was good, the sauce was yummy, but the portion wasn't as big as I hoped. Worth $23? No.\n3) The complementary Pizza Bianca was awesome.\n\nAnyway, they had some pretty awesome beers and cocktails. Try the Smoke & Spice Cocktail--it smelled/tasted like inhaled anesthesia!\n\nThe service sucked. The servers were very apologetic about everything that happened but that doesn't change the fact that there is bad service.

The pizza was light and interesting with great flavor combination, it was more of a flat bread and a great portion for two.  The salad with feta was nice, nothing too special and a bit salty. \n\nThe oxtail was great, falling off the bone, great flavor and braising.  It would have been nice to have some sides with the oxtail for the price.  The rabbit sugo and fettuccine was nice, the pasta was home made, tender, delicious, the rabbit was nice but could have been more tender, and the portion was quite small.

The SO and I were in SF for a night before heading to wine country and were meeting a friend at Locanda before planning to head to Foreign Cinema for dinner, as soon as I walked into Locanda the charcoal grill scent sold me and I told the better-half we should just eat there, it smelled that good.\n\nSo, we ended up eating there and it was great.  I would highly recommend the Roman Style Beef Jerky as a quick appetizer, it's cheap and very good...and not something you'll see at a bunch of restaurants.  Two of us had the Radiatore Pecora e Pecorino (aka - Lamb Ragu) as well as Petrale Sole \"Scuola Vecchia\" - the Ragu was delicious and just the right size.  The presentation of the Sole was gorgeous, and the mussels to go along with it were a nice addition as well.\n\nI have to say, the bread was the highlight, warm and light, covered in Olive Oil - wow - best bread I've had in a long time.\n\nTo go back to my opening statement, the food was great, so was the atmosphere and the smells.  However, once you leave the restaurant and head home you realize how much you smell like heavy smoke.  Remember the days when bars weren't smoke free and you'd have to come home and wash all your clothes and shower before turning it as you'd reek of cigarettes?

There were nice big chunks of smoky pork, which is always welcome.  It was definitely rich and one portion was more than enough for two people.\n\nFinally, the mixed grill.  I would get this again for the blood sausage alone, which is delicately spiced and has a gorgeous moist (not crumbly!) texture.  The spare ribs may be the weak point because really, there's only so much you can do with spare ribs.

All of this is to say, the service is unnecessarily bad.\n\nWhat do I mean by unnecessarily?  First, clearly these folks have a bit of experience running a classy restaurant, so even though this particular joint is new, they are not new to the business.  Secondly, the table right next to us (who were seated after us), was getting amazingly attentive service.  It's like they were rubbing it in our face.  I believe the folks next to us were brought bread, wine, and more wine, and were checked on... before our server bothered to even greet us.  The tables were really close, all he would have had to do was pivot, didn't even need to take a single extra step.

I did not know that artichoke hearts could taste so wonderful. The chopped basil on the bottom gave the dish flavor some OOMPH. I would get that again.\n\nFor pastas, we shared the Fettuccini rabit - this was a great pasta. I don't think I had tried rabbit up to this day, and it was actually yummy. i felt bad for eating little Peter Rabbit but it was delicious. Another pasta we ordered was Bucatini all'Amatriciana, which our waiter described (in Italian accent!) as a classical pasta. Everyone at the table liked it except for me - the pasta was borderline crunchy! I think I am more of a soft-pasta girl. Also, the cheese was overwhelming me. After eating these two, we decided to order one more since we were still hungry - Rigatoni alla carbonara. I thought this one was pretty good. I wasn't crazy about it though.\n\nFor entree, I had the Kampachi. I was looking forward to this fish because not a lot of restaurants serve Kampachi. However, when I took my first bite, it was plain. I tried dipping it in the sauce, but the sauce was also plain. I honestly was extremely disappointed. I salted that fish like crazy in order to get some flavor out of it, still tasted \"meh.\" My boyfriend and his parents got Lamb and Steak though, and those tasted a lot better than mine. I would suggest those if you made a reservation. \n\nFor dessert, we got a fried Ricotta cheese dish, which I really enjoyed. It had a bit of sour taste on the outside, but also sweet from the cheese.  I loved the affogito (not sure how to spell it) - vanilla ice cream drenched with an expresso shot. It was delish!\n\nI wouldn't return. The artichoke was great, the pastas were so-so and the dessert was great. Big things are missing - aka the entrees!  Not worth the price.

Don't kowtow to restaurants who try to trick you into tolerating ridiculously overpriced and tiny portions of \"meh\" food because they fancy themselves a high-end eating establishment. Sub-par quality food, rude and incompetent management, and high prices- stay away Mission-ites and San Franciscans, in general! \n\nFirst, we ordered the raved-about Jewish-style Artichokes. Seriously, Yelpers? I always trust your judgment, but our table of 6 found them laughable. They were shriveled up, fried to a burnt crisp, and then doused in salt. Gross. They were also tiny. One $8 'choke was the size of my fist, with most of it being the inedible stem. No thanks, Locanda. \n\nThen came the Stracciatella in Brodo which claimed to have oxtail in it. I even asked the waitress to clarify whether it was similar to an oxtail stew, to which she replied, \"Yes.\" When it came out, it looked and tasted like egg-drop soup in beef broth. Like the kind you get for free at a Chinese restaurant. And no oxtail! Not one shred. It was $9 beef broth with scrambled egg. \n\nMy tablemate ordered the $27 grilled leg of lamb. When that came out, it consisted of 4 strips of lamb on lettuce. I clarify- $27 for 4 THIN strips of lamb and wet lettuce. Are we getting punk'd?  Where's the leg? Doesn't a leg have a bone?At Locanda, it doesn't.\n\nThe rest of the table got their pasta dishes, which was 2 cans of Chef Boyardee split into 4 portions. Enough said. \n\nThe manager arrived and I still don't know her name because she never offered it to me. She came over, bent down, and stared at me. I expressed my concerns, and she proceeded to tell me how wrong I was about everything. She even gave me a complimentary Italian lesson on what \"stratcciatella,\" \"brodo,\" \"and leg of lamb\" means. Wow, thanks! She also told me their food is comparable to the surrounding area. That's hilarious mainly because it's not. Sure, $27 is a comparable price, but broth, boyardee, and meat scraps are not comparable in quantity or quality. I'm not sure why she even bothered coming over. She didn't offer to fix anything; she only encouraged me to order another laughable dish. \n\nSave your selves, your wallets, and your sanity, and go to any other restaurant in this area: Picaro, Limon, Delfina, Foreign Cinema, Luna Park, Maverick, etc., etc.\n\n/endrant", "author": "Annie C."}

He said it was going to be tough and that his first table wasn't until 10:15, but if they could get us seated earlier they would.  Well, they did.  \n\nService:  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  When I asked her a question about the menu that she didn't have the answer to, rather than make something up or blow off my question, she offered to go back to the kitchen and find out.  None of that, \"I'm a know-it-all and you're an idiot\" attitude that plagues the SF restaurant service industry. \n\nFood:  From the first bite of the fried artichokes all the way through dessert, Affogato Correto, everything was amazing.  I lived in Rome, Italy for two years and even though I wouldn't call their Italian cuisine totally \"authentic\", I definitely wouldn't say it was a mistake and get creative by putting a spin on traditional dishes like \"Carcioffi alla Judea\".  The food was amazing.  \n\nDrinks:  I did something I rarely do and ordered one of their specialty whiskey drinks.

It's basically just a few pieces of bread and a few pieces of prosciutto. And they go together wonderfully.\nThe wine was not memorable, and my mixed drink wasn't either.\nThe bad part was the entrees. By comparison to the chicken, the steak was superb. Although on its own, it was actually kind of chewy, not very tender, although the taste was good. The chicken, though, was atrocious. It was undercooked and rubbery. \"It tasted like a bunch of plastic,\" according to my friend, who also says \"I come from the chicken country\" ( Poulet de Bresse ). The \"bacon wrapped\" part seemed like it wood be a great idea, but it didn't make up for the lack of cooking. I don't mind chicken skin, but my friend who prefers to avoid the fatty chicken skin and likes her bacon crispy, was displeased by the thick, slippery, watery \"bacon skin\" area. \"It was so watery that it removed all the taste.\"\nAnyway, this seems like a nice place for a drink and a pizza Bianca, but not for chicken or steak.", "author": "Nick B."}

More your typical SF Californian cuisine using Italian components. \n\nThe fried sweetbreads and artichokes were fantastic. Tender halves of artichoke hearts were the taste of spring mornings, gently enveloped in a delicious, almost airy, crisp. Tossed in the mix were the sweetbreads; they too resided in these perfectly seasoned golden pockets.. The sweetbreads were soft yet bouncy, with a salty creaminess that reminded me of steamed fish milt. Scattered were fried sage and capers, all consumed and without a trace.\n\nFor entree, I had the grilled lamb leg with chickpeas and lettuce. Lamb had never associated with the word 'light'; yet somehow, this dish was exactly that. Pink, juicy slices rested on top of mashed chickpeas, adorned by pale emerald greens. It was flavorful yet delightfully refreshing at the same time. The disappointment though, was that the lamb was not well seasoned. It sounds ridiculous to say that it tasted too much of lamb - but it did. And I love gaminess. But this is just a bit single-noted. \n\nM had the prosciutto wrapped rabbit with gnocchi and grilled lettuce. The prosciutto became too smokey and overpowering; while god, we hardly tasted the rabbit. It could be a piece of chicken and it would have tasted the same. The gnocchi was actually deep fried, which was interesting but not as good as regular creamy gnocchis. \n\nIt was a delightful meal. Not the rustic affair I had anticipated, but a simple, refreshing Californian twist on some old world components. There were small details here or there that needed to be a bit more balanced. Though for the price, I'm not sure if I'd come back.", "author": "Fiona S."}

Being gluten free these days, my options were obviously cut back but for my main option; I went with one of their pasta dishes but opted for the gluten free noodles. I was \"wowed\" and even raved about it to my friend who was not eating the gluten free version. I was emphatic about it, \"Try this! Try this! It doesn't even TASTE like gluten free.\" Hesitantly, she forked a bit of pasta into her mouth and said, \"Oh.

The bread had a nice chew, with just enough oil and salt to keep things interesting.\n\nJewish Style Artichoke - Now this was fun. Apparently this is a classic dish from the Jewish area of Rome - an artichoke deep fried and topped with mint. The interior was meaty and the exterior crispy, quite tasty. I liked the mint, which added just a little bit of brightness to the dish; a lemon wedge added some welcome acidity.\n\nBucatini all' Amatriciana guanciale, tomato, peperoncini, pecorino - I thought this was a very good version of the classic. Expectantly so, the pasta was perfectly cooked, leaving just a bit of chew to the pasta. The guanciale (cured pork cheek) imparted a little richness and hint of pork flavor, while there was just a little bit of spiciness that crept up on the palate. It was borderline too spicy for my mother, but I found it just right.\n\nRadiatore \"Pecora e Pecorino\" lamb ragu, pecorino, mint - Excellent dish. I really liked the radiator-shaped pasta as it clung to the ragu so well. The pasta almost had a spongy texture because it had so much sauce, and really made for some good bites. The ragu was rich and meaty, and I thought the cheese added some nice flavor too.\n\nRigatoni alla Carbonara guanciale, egg, pecorino, black pepper - I liked the rigatoni's chew and subtle flavors of the egg and pecorino, but I found this pasta to be a little bit less exciting than the previous two. Still, a good rendition of the carbonara.\n\nGuinea Hen Leg al spiedo - A guinea hen leg was deboned, then wrapped in spices, lardo and proscuitto. Sounds good? It was delicious. Really tender and moist with exceptional flavor. The skin was crisped up really well too, and the meaty flavors were balanced well with some bitter greens and lentils. Probably my favorite dish of the night.\n\nWarm Chocolate Cake maple syrup, walnuts - The cake was warm and really soft, with an almost pudding-like interior. I liked the extra depth of flavor from the maple syrup, as well as the contrast of the whipped cream.\n\nLocanda met my expectations (which were high, given the pedigree and buzz). I found the meal somewhat similar in style to one I recently had at Cotogna, but I think I'd give a slight edge to Locanda (though, I tried a limited number of items at both).

Apparently this place is always packed because the hostess told me that guests usually make their reservations to dine here at least 3 weeks in advance.  My friend and I waited about 20 minutes for our reserved table.\n\nUpon ordering our food, we were served house bread and butter.   It wasn't the most amazing bread I've ever had, but it was warm and satisfying.  We couldn't decide what to order.  So much the two of us wanted to try.  Ultimately, we chose the pizza Bianca to share.  For dinner, Thuy ordered the linguine and I ordered the local halibut.\n\nPizza Bianca: This is not the conventional round pizza.  It is served as 3 separate slices on a cheese board.  Very cool presentation and very yummy.  The sauce is cream -based versus tomato-based.  \n\nLinguini:  Wow, this pasta is absolutely delicious.  It is lite, but packed full of flavor.  The ingredients include crab, lettuce, and sorrel.  I wish I had my own order!\n\nLocal Halibut:  This white fish is bursting with flavor.  It is served in a pancetta broth with fennel and clams.  For a fish dish, the amount served was generous and filling.  I dipped the bread into my broth when I was done with the entree.  I loved it!  \n\n\nSide note: In terms of seating, it was a bit awkward because the table next to us was so close that I felt we were at the same table, lol!  It felt more and more uncomfortable as the couple next to us continuously listened in on our conversation and repeatedly starred at us.    \n\nNonetheless, I will be back with more friends so we can try everything else on the menu.  This place is a must try!", "author": "Gloria Y."}

It's obviously very popular. I tried earlier this week and was really disappointed. If i'm going to buy pasta in a restaurant, it must be better than what I can do at home. I've been to Rome and almost everything tastes great, even food they sell in gas stations. Not so at Locanda. I couldn't even eat the first lamb ragu i ordered, so i asked the waiter to recommend another. It tasted basically, like Mac 'n cheese with some pork belly thrown: for $18! We ordered rack of lamb and it was really salty.\n\nTables are crammed together and we could smell our neighbors cologne and perfumes. It was loud.  It was hot, and felt like it needed better ventilation. I was sweating and couldn't wait to leave and get outside. it took for ever for them to get me my bill so that I could bolt out of there.\n\nto be fair, it's not a terrible restaurant as i make it sound, but it's not exceptional either.\n\nLoved the ginger soda and Apertivo drinks.

A bit annoying but I get it, it's Friday night. We got a great table in the back half or the restaurant so we weren't by the door and awkward people standing over the poor people in the front.\n\nAfter we were sat, we were given water and ignored for another 15 minutes as we watched other later sat tables getting served. I have now been here 40 minutes after a long week and a special night with out a cocktail. \n\nWho I would assume to be the restaurant manager came over and took our order realizing we had been ignored for some time, I probably wore the look on my face. He offered us an appetizer that never arrived and then our entrees came.\n\nThe entrees which I initially thought were the appetizer because of the size were dropped off and even though small in size they were amazing, I just wish I knew about the portions and would have ordered differently. I had the carbonara and my date had the rigatoni and they were both exquisite. Temperature hot, seasoned perfect, presentation great and all the amazing textures were divine. \n\nTo wrap up the evening a different server or busier cleared our plates and brought the bill.

Everything from the appetizers (like the delightful Jewish-style artichoke which is crispy on the outside and melt in your mouth tender on the inside) to the pastas (delicate shrimp and burrata ravioli, savory rabbit linguine and more) to an after dinner cheese plate is delicious with perfect textures, perfect tempuratures, and wonderfully nuanced flavors. There's a convivial buzz, and people flow in and out but the tables stay full. With all that going for, you would think they would want the the service to match. There were no big gaffs, just a combination of little things (how long it took to get some bread, not being asked if we wanted another cocktail, not explaining the cheese plate) that added up to a lesser experience. Now to be fair, they serve as a team and some folks were much more attentive than othets. But when I go someplace, regardless of whether they're busy or not, I'm always looking for that feeling that comes when you know you are an honored guest. The places that manage to pull it off are the ones that really stand out in a city full of places with amazing food.\n\nP.S. Make sure to have an appetizer if you are considering pasta as a main course. The portions are on the small side. The house bread is really wonderful. Definitely have a slice. \n\nP.P.S. If you are driving into the mission, consider using the valet service. It completely eliminates the aggravation of trying to park in the mission on a Saturday night, its well worth  the $10 plus tip.

Part of it speaks to my jewish ancestry, which just only sweetens the deal for me. \n\nThe wait staff is incredible.  The hostess smile warmly at you the moment you enter, making sure you feel comfortable, and basically beconing you in the door... A+ for customer service. \n\nThe wait staff is busy, but make sure to give you the one on one attention you need, and area always making the rounds to check in on you, refill your water, and reload you with the AMAZING Pizza Bianca- or whatever the hell is the standard table bread that they bring around....\n\n5 stars all the way!", "author": "Best M."}

We ordered sunchoke soup - which was very flavorful. I also had the artichoke salad, which was healthy tasting!\n\nFor the mains, we both tried their pastas.

Cute decor, interesting pictures on the walls, and we got the back corner table that seemed romantic.\n\nDrink choice was THE MISTRESS (Gin, Cantaloupe, Verjus). server mentioned that was a typo and they couldn't make that. he was saying they had this other drink..plum..mint..orange..something overly strong..i thought i'd try it out. looked beautiful, wasn't my type of drink though. Server changed it out for a crisp glass of Soave, no charge on the cocktail *thank you*. Bf got the FERNET NO.3.\n\nLet me start off by stating that I was not impressed with first course, but the fettucini blew me away, as well as one of the desserts.\n\n\"White pizza (pizza bianca) omits the tomato sauce, often substituting pesto or dairy products such as sour cream. Most commonly, especially on the East coast of the United States, the toppings consist only of mozzarella and ricotta cheese drizzled with olive oil and spices like fresh basil and garlic. In Rome, the term pizza bianca refers to a type of bread topped with olive oil, salt and, occasionally, rosemary sprigs\" per Wikipedia\n\nI wish i knew that so i wouldn't have been excited to try a handmade small 'pizza' with the crushed plum and prosciutto. this was more like a  super sharp crostini with some delicious plum and prosciutto on it. Don't get me wrong, it tasted great, I wouldnt suggest getting prosciutto again because it's not a very elegant thing to try and bite.\n\n2nd bite: we came here for the sweetbreads!! of course, this night, they decided to change it up to fried lamb's brain with artichokes (with fried sage, parsley, capers). the artichokes were perfect in flavor and texture, the lamb brains were a bit too soft for my liking. it certainly needed the lemon squeeze, sage, and capers with each bite. bf enjoyed them :)\n\nFETTUCCINI -rabbit sugo, cicoria, verjus, hands down the best pasta i've ever eaten. the rabbit was delicious, but sparse. for $17 i would have thought atleast another forkful of pasta should have been there. Super simple, bits of rabbit, fettuccini and very light sauce. Amazing.\n\nAlso a wonderful dish: \nCASARECCEI - pig's trotter, green tomatoes. pork was cooked perfectly, bursting with flavor. the casareccei was good, but not exciting, the sauce had a nice subtle kick to it. \n\ndesserts\n(Sori del Re, Moscato d'Asti, Piemonte, Italy)\nPeach Crostata with vanilla gelato. I don't get putting a semi room temp dessert with a cold ice cream (gelato). usually you pair a hot and cold together for the contrast. The peach crostata was good, but to be honest, my bf's vegan peach crisp the other night blew me away..\n\nTHE BEST thing here:  \nRICOTTA FRITTA (citrus caramel, lemon thyme) GET two orders!! You are ment to pop one in your mouth, drizzled with the lemon thyme and it's just a flavor explosion of perfection and heaven mixed into one.\n\nAround $70 on food, $40 on drinks. I will come back for the sweebreads, to try more pasta, and the ricotta fritta :)", "author": "Abigail W."}

Everything we had was absolutely delicious and I am still craving the lobster spaghetti weeks later. \n\nThe vibe is lively and fun, with a good buzz in the air, but we never felt crowded or rushed.  I dare say it had a \"New York\" kind of feeling, which then becomes a kind of stay-cation in itself!  \n\nI can't believe it took me that long to get there, and I am hoping to be back again soon.

It took 10 minutes to seat us after we arrived for our reservation. Service was incredibly slow and staff was not very friendly. We ordered the coppiette and fried olives for appetizers. The copiette arrived immediately, whereas the olives required two additional requests. I ordered the halibut as a main. The fish was very fresh and delicious; the bok choy was a bit greasy and wilted. We decided to forgo dessert since we had been at the restaurant for over 2 1/2 hours.

This place was recommended on a foodie's blog, so we had relatively high expectations. \n\nWe tried the:\nJewish-style Artichoke - I have to admit I solely got this based on the fact that it was mentioned in so many Yelp reviews. While quite pricey for the small artichoke you get, it was definitely tasty. Not greasy at all, very clean and refreshingly simple.\n\nCoppiette - cured pork jerky. Came as a long strand of meat and heavily smoked. I did not enjoy this at all, we left it alone after the first bite. \n\nRigatoni alla Carbonara - very delicious variation on a classic dish. The rigatoni was slightly undercooked, but the sauce is amazing and I *loved* the guanciale (cured pork cheek) in it. \n\nAcqua Pazza Rock Cod - this is the daily fish cooked \"crazy water\" style. It was initially a trout that day, but was sold and replaced with a rock cod. Fish is pretty significant (pretty sure this should be a \"sharing\" dish), poached in white wine sauce. \n\nCorn (side) - corn kernels with red chile peppers.

I knew they were Warby Parker because I told her they looked amazing and wanted to know where she got them.\n\nThe first taste of Locanda came with their unexpected bread. Brightly colored and with a beautiful silky butter glaze. It must have been freshly painted because a thin film of the butter would stay on your fingers after touching it. And if the bread was a painting for butter then this was a masterpiece worthy of an Italian museum. As light as air but with a taste of heaven.\n\nFollowed that up with fried olives stuffed with Fontina cheese. Oh my god! First of all, I friggin hate olives. The only reason I considered this meal was because our waitress recommended it and few weeks ago this Armenian dude let me try one of each of his olives from the olive bar at his store. That taught me that not all olives taste like cr@p. So with that in mind and her recommendation we got these. They were amazing.\n\nOf course nothing can prepare you for cannelloni I got. With nettles and ricotta they were sublime.\n\nAfter the main course I thought it would be a crime not to get dessert here when everything else was go spectacular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-20", "description": "We visited Delfina's hip n busy sister on a Friday night. As usual she was entertaining a flurry of guests; The hipsters, the professionals, the drunks, the gays, the straights, the puppy loves, the old couples, and anyone else who has the patience or could afford to be in her presence. Locanda doesn't discriminate. She enjoys the bustling crowd as much as they enjoy her style... A rustic meets contemporary type setting with wooden floors and tables in a somewhat dimly lit room, brightened with white walls, while the mirrors give the illusion of spaciousness... Enough that I forgot how much I abhor tight spaces while being bumped around as if in a pinball machine as servers weave in n out of all the standing guests anxiously waiting to be at one of Locanda's dining tables.  This pinball machine's theme? Unmistakably food and alcohol. The experience? Well worth the time you put in at 'insert coins'. Her friendly and competent staff takes ownership of her parties.  It starts at the door, where her friendly hosts greet every guest with the warmest smiles, past the busy multitasking bartenders along the left and servers entertaining seated guests on the right, to the very back where the cooks work magic, teasing our hungers' patience with the aroma of spices and fresh ingredients. The practice of discipline n class is vital during your visit as you can see how one can easily become the \"Diva\" of a Snickers commercial if not mentally prepared.\n\nWe came mentally prepared and yet the three of us nearly fell victim to a Snickers bar moment. Luckily two seats opened up at the bar.  Rather than waiting another 45 minutes on top of the initial 45 minutes, we ditched the dream of having a table for 3 on such a TGIF.  I was more than willing to stand as my beautiful GF and lovely sister from another mister took a seat. We were so famished from a long work day we just fired away.  \n\nDrinks - The bone marrow caught me soooo off guard that I really forgot what I had but it was good... The tequila and pomegranate cocktail I think it was and the cocktail with gin in it. Sorry. If you follow my reviews they are usually much more descriptive but that bone marrow coming up next really did throw me off quite a bit.\n\nBone marrow - the BIGGEST disappointment I've had EVER with Locanda!!! It was under the small bites section of their menu but if only you saw how small the amount of marrow there was... If it was clothing it would be like labeling a T-Shirt adult S for men but when you put it on, IF you can even put it on, it's actually a petite female T-Shirt size XXS even in petite style.  I wish I had a picture of it for you guys but it was soooo dim in there I didn't want to blind people with that crazy Samsung flash.  On the plate was 2 X-LARGE thickly sliced toasts.  Imagine something like a small espresso stir spoon... Yes, that was all the marrow there was which was able to just tease us by buttering up that one nibble of a corner of one of the toasts.  Brought it up to one of the servers and he says, \"That IS (exaggerated accent on the IS) pretty small compared to normal.  It IS (once again he exaggerated the IS) in the small bites section though so it's really a bite.\" Try a lick buddy. I'd rather butter up a nipple with that Q-Tip of marrow for a more seductive experience. We were pretty much robbed of 7 bucks plus tax and tips. A little bitter. Can't believe I didn't give them 3 stars or less. I still love you Locanda.\n\nSweetbreads fried artichokes parsley n capers squeeze of lemon - Freakin' delicous.  Fried to a light crispy crusted perfection while still moist and tender with every bite. The artichoke and capers were a nice touch especially with lemon brightening up the deep fried goodies.\n\nShort rib pasta - Little balls of pasta wrapped short rib with a sauce that was probably made from the braising of the short ribs. Gigi M. doesn't eat beef and even she loved it.\n\nChanterelle pine nuts - Mushrooms are always a must in my books... you can't really mess up with mushrooms unless you really didn't know what you were doing.  Get it if you love the light earthy peppery sweet flavors of the Chanterelle.\n\nBucatini - Liked it a lot but didn't love it.  They do make the bucatini in house but I've had much better although the tomato sauce was fresh, mildly sweet, and had just the right acidity.  Hard to love it when Tony's Pizza in North Beach has it down to a science.  \n\nBerkshire Pork Panchetta - Crispy skin, fats rendered, tender moist flesh gives you the perfect warm savory bite with all three textures.  That was my fave of the night along with the fish!\n\nGrilled Cod w chicories sea salt spicy sauce olive oil and lemon on the side - grilled with such skill that the flesh was a tender fleshy flaky bite.  I usually cringe when it comes to Americans and fish but they did it just right even for the like of a Chinese.  I loved how they didn't over season it, allowing the freshness of the fish to shine.  \n\nMust try guys!", "author": "Colin M."}

Unfortunately, they are apparently so popular right now, it is a place to \"see and be seen\", and service levels always seem to suffer in restaurants like that\n\nIn Depth Review:\nReservations-- Our group of 8 was looking forward to trying this highly rated dinner spot, so we knew reservations were a must and made them months in advance for a special occasion. \n\nThe \"reservation\" was basically worthless, as we still had to wait another 30 minutes before getting a table... I've never understood restaurants that take reservations and then force you to wait. If WE had showed up 30 minutes late, do you think they would be happy about it?? Hell no!! (What we observed as we waited was very poor, haphazard table management by the staff)\n\nAfter we complained about the wait, the manager, who at least was apologetic, finally cobbled a couple of tables together and comped us 2 $5 apps to keep us quiet... wow\n\nCocktails-- very good, some unique flavors\n\nService-- exceptionally SLOOOOW, with no sense of urgency, inaccurate, and aloof. We waited long periods of time for food and then some dishes were served cold. I asked for a black napkin after my black shirt got white fuzz all over it from their white napkin and was met with an eye roll from our server, but she did bring one\n\nThe entrees for the table came out from the kitchen at different times, often served to the wrong person, and we had to sit an inappropriate amount of time with our food in front of us, getting cold, waiting for the rest of the table to be served. One diner asked for his whole fish to be de-boned, but when it arrived it wasn't de-boned, so MORE waiting and no apology for the mistake. And sadly, the server did not initially comp the apps on our bill as her manager had instructed, and had to be reminded\n\nFood-- The bread is heavenly. Apps (Jewish artichokes, sweetbreads, and fried olives) were all good. The pastas were hit-or-miss, the whole fish was okay, but lacked flavors other than \"fish\", and the guinea hen was phenomenal, easily the best dish on the menu.\n\nMiscellaneous-- The place is very, very, very LOUD. We were constantly saying \"WHAT??\", \"Sorry, can't hear you\", \"WHAT??\" ... Romantic and intimate it is not\n\nIn addition, when we made the reservation, we were told that getting a cab back to our hotel was \"no problem\". NOTHING could be further from the truth... Upon leaving the restaurant, we asked the hostess to call us 2 cabs. She responded by saying she \"guessed\" she could do that, but not to expect any taxis to actually show up, since they are \"too busy on a Saturday night\" to come pick us up.\n\nWe also asked the valet staff to help, but they refused, saying it wasn't their problem. (They apparently weren't interested in any tip money from us) And even though taxis were everywhere, none stopped in front of Laconda. SO, we ended up having to walk to the corner and out into the street to force a cab to stop... Not cool... This alone is a very good reason to avoid this particular area of SF on a Saturday night, and take your money elsewhere \n\nIs Laconda worth it? Sadly, I say no...", "author": "Steve K."}

However, it's rare that I'm so moved by some particular drink that I'm compelled to dedicate an entire article to singing its praises. This is one of those occasions.\n\nThe Church, currently on Locanda's cocktail menu, is the perfect summer drink. Made with gin, aperol, cocchi americano, and lemon, it's a taste I had never experienced until recently - probably because I was unfamiliar with 50% of the ingredients. The gin and lemon, obviously. Anyway, after returning three times within one month just to order as many as I possibly can, I now officially rank it as one of my all-time favorite drinks. Why? Because it's refreshing without being cliche, substantial without being too heavy, and chalk full of alcohol without being unbalanced.\n\nThis cocktail doesn't reek of gin, nor does it taste similar to your standard \"refreshing\" drinks like a basil gimlet or something girly mixed with Prosecco and St. Germaine. No, this is an original - one that anyone, no matter what your hard liquor preferences may be, would find appealing.

The event coordinator, Heather went above and beyond helping us organize such a wonderful event. \n \nWe couldn't have been more pleased with Heather's recommendation to host our event at Locanda. The positive vibes in the front of the restaurant carried through to the semi-private room in the back where our guests sat. The back room was separated from the front with a curtain, has nice view of the chefs cooking, great lighting and nice long tables for a unique family-style dining. We were confident no detail would be overlooked with Heather's exceptional help and event experience.\n \nOverall, we can't say enough good things about the food, service and cocktails.

Solid food, an atmosphere which strikes the balance between Nice and Fun, and great service.  I'm a big fan of the cocktails, and the ever-changing handmade pastas are routinely great.  I've been a bit underwhelmed by the entrees in the past so I go for appetizers and the aforementioned pasta at this point.  Anyway, the staff is really what makes the place great.  I always leave feeling looked-after but never pressured, which is particularly cool in that as often as not I'm leaving as they're closing up.  Sorry 'bout that...\n\n------\n\n@Pedro I.\n\nThe standard markup for any booze in any restaurant is 300% at the _minimum_.  Restaurants frequently lose money on food in the expectation of making it back on the beverages. Furthermore, on glass pours there is the extra need to compensate for the remainder of the bottle getting dumped at the end of the night (what, you'd rather drink oxidized wine?).  \n\nWhile it is more than understandable that this strikes you as excessive, it's something you'll see over and over when you price things out in the future.  For example, a 750ml bottle of Grey Goose costs roughly $30.  There's a touch over 25oz in there, so with a standard 1.5oz pour in a cocktail that equals 16 drinks.  Even if you're paying $7 for that cocktail (unheard of at this point) then you're paying the equivalent of $116 for a $30 bottle.  It's even more extreme with beer, especially if it's out of a keg.  I would encourage you to think of it as simply paying for a wonderful setting in which to have a great experience. In SF, with the cost of real estate as well as the minimum wage of $12/hr being what they are, that's exactly what it is.\n\nSo yeah, man - if that's the only reason for your 2 stars then you might want to rethink your ranking.", "author": "Muhammad I."}

This is the kind of place where you can expect to be seated practically on top of the people next to you, and as such I was right next to a party of 3 who were so loud I had to shout to my dining companion the entire evening. This felt like I was trying to eat in a club and was the opposite of intimate. Our server was friendly but a little overbearing and continually interrupted us all evening. \n\nThe food: I'm no stranger to nice restaurants, but I also don't speak Italian, so some descriptions on the menu would be helpful. Everything tasted good, but we didn't get very much food considering we spent about $40 a person before tip.

Putting your fork to cut through these is not hard work at all.  After all, didn't we just work 8 hours? It cuts through with a butter knife. Now that's how Oxtail is done.

The pancetta complimented this rich tasting duck for sure.  I have to admit, paired with this wine made it FANTASTIC and me wanting more.

We called last minute and got a table an hour later.  It was a cool place, nicely decorated.  The waitstaff and service were excellent.  I knocked over a glass of wine and our waitress topped everybody off.  We were served some excellent pizza bianco to get things going.  My only real complaint about the restaurant was that there was a dearth of reasonably priced wine.  A $40 bottle of primitivo, chianti classico or Malbec would be welcome.   The appetizers were mostly great- we enjoyed the Roman style artichokes, fried olives and proscuitto.  We tried the radishes with anchovy butter because we couldn't imagine what it would taste like.  It was the restaurant's only miss.  Main courses were very good to excellent.  The pork saltimbocca was excellent and flavor intense.  The cuscini with shrimp was really good.  Grilled fish was good.  We really enjoyed the desserts.  The almond torta and chocolate bread pudding both had their fans.  \n\nReally fun evening at a very good restaurant with excellent service.

The appetizers are well-conceived, tasty, and priced to please: to wit, a deep-fried strand of artichokes and sweetbreads ($12), the do-not-miss lamb's tongue ($12), a hearty trio of oxtails ($22), and a fried duck egg on simple greens ($12).\n\nThe pasta mains ($14-$18) are a little more troublesome - enough to peg the dining experience at 'wholly mediocre'. \n\nLocanda's saving grace (unexpectedly, given low-corkage-fee BYOB) is its bar, which deserves four stars on a standalone basis. Drinks are beautifully designed and delivered; take a chance on the barkeep's choice, if you find yourself in the unlikely scenario that nothing on the menu inspires. \n\nMy advice: skip dinner, stick to the bites and the bar.", "author": "Liz C."}

It ended up being a 20 minute wait on a Sunday night around 9pm. \n\nWe decided to grab a cocktail at the bar while we waited for a table. They promptly gave us water, and served us right away. The cocktails here are excellent! With several specials, they conjured up some wonderful mixtures. You can also request one by the bartender based on your likings. \n\nAn arugula with artichokes & avocados tossed in a very light dressing was a good starter (can't remember the name). They start you off with warm toasty bread as well (which I thought was a little too buttery & salty to my liking). \n\nFor my main dish I had the Linguini with dungeness crab, lettuce and sorrel ($22). The Linguini noodles were fabulous- as they tasted fresh and yummy. As for the rest of the dish, it lacked a little umph. It was lightly flavored, but unfortunately  I'm going to have to say I was really bored of the dish by the end of my meal. And it didn't help the main dish took surprisingly longer than expected... Left me a bit crabby (har har). \n\nThe service throughout the meal was good. The waiter was kind enough to explain the dishes and refilled our water when possible. \n\nNow as for the decor- I was a little confused, yet amused by it. The front of the restaurant was very modern like and the back seemed more of a 70's, retro feel with grandma's curtains along the wall. Definitely a different feel in the back than the front. \n\nOverall, I think Locanda could use some improvement. I won't brush it off entirely, as I have yet to try the rest of the dishes, and there's always room for improvement. \n\nP.S. A plus in my books is that there are hooks at the bar to hang your belongings. I see this more often now, and I'm glad places like this have it!", "author": "Catherine O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-22", "description": "I know it's a fine line to tread when it comes to pleasing the uber picky SF foodies.  We want authentic food that lies within our comfort zone, we want cool decor that doesn't look like it's trying too hard, we want a wait staff that's easy on the eyes but not so beautiful you think they think they are better than you. \n\nAlas, Locanda seems to be a bit lacking when it comes to balancing these key factors to a good restaurant.  \n\nFirst and most important: food.  The entire menu is in Italian, which serves as a nice boasting vehicle if you are trying to impress a date that you have travelled to Italy and knows the difference between bucatini and fettucine.  But for us commoners, it takes work and courage to not feel like a complete illiterate. \n\nUpon the description the waitress gave us on the bucatini with peperonci, our mouths watered because \"pasta with meat sauce\" (in layman term) sounded awfully familiar to what we had at Seven Hills a few months ago.  The flavorful meat and silky noodles.  Oh my.  Half of us caved in and ordered the same thing. \n\nUnfortunately the bucatini was good, but definitely couldn't compare to Seven Hill's version.  The pasta was a bit too al dente and the meat sauce was too salty and fatty to finish.  \n\nAllow me to segway into this topic of saltiness: why so salty?  A couple of weeks ago I had dinner at 54 Mint, an Italian restaurant I loved and my friend's pasta carbonara was too salty too.  She, more outspoken than I, let the waiter know and soon the manager came and explained that it's a Roman thing and a lot of SFers couldn't take it.  So are we just wussy health nuts? Or should Romans be watching out for their arteries?\n\nAnyway, let's bring the story back to Locanda and talk about the appetizers.  Since every yelper seemed to have raved about the Jewish style artichoke and pizza bianca, we tried them too.  Artichoke was good or \"tasted like fried chicken\" as one of our friends claimed.  But it felt like it could have been anything deep fried.  I wasn't sure if I could taste any of the artichoke essence in the dish.  The pizza bianca was more like bruscheta where you spread the bone marrow onto the bread yourself.  It was okay. \n\nFor dessert, the ricotta fritta yelpers seem to like was good.  Warm chocolate cake was good, but I have yet to see any well-reputed restaurant messing up chocolate cake.  And it sorta made me yearn for Pizzeta 211's chocolate cake.  good sign, bad sigh?\n\nPrice was reasonable.  Plenty of food for $35 per person including tax and tips.  Ambiance is beautiful. I liked the decor a lot.  Good looking waitstaff and an energetic crowd.  hard to believe it was a mere Tuesday night when the restaurant was filled with people. \n\nSo, yes, despite the over hyped food, Locanda has no issue continuing its popularity.  I only wish it was as justified as Delfina's.", "author": "Candice B."}

Wayyyy better than Delfina.\n\nThe kitchen is straight up New York--- you can watch them work and they look like flowing water. There is not a flick of the wrist or any single motion that they do back there that's not contributing to their cooking. They make exceptionally delicious new Italian dishes.\n\nOn a night that I spent about three hours here, one at the bar and the two at the table, it was one of the best restaurant experiences I've had so far in SF. My guest, an elite pastry chef, was enthralled with their fried lamb brain. When his boyfriend finally joined us we ordered another plate on the spot. I'd never eaten brains of an animal before because.... well... it's brains. But I'm so glad we got the dish!! The brain bites were well seasoned and crunchy on the outside and the inside was melty--- it tasted like lamb foie gras. That's the depth of the skill of the chefs at Locanda, they could probably serve me something in a bucket and I'd love it.\n\nOh, so, speaking of serving dishes in buckets, could Locanda serve their rabbit saddle in a bucket? Like fried chicken? That would be a hit restaurant, LFR Locanda Fried Rabbit. I inhaled it, I wish I could eat it every day. The flesh was so juicy and tasted like rabbit but didn't have the gnarly gaminess that usually comes with the meat.\n\nOne thing though, they say they have \"pizza\". No, what they are serving is not pizza, but it tastes really freakin' good nevertheless. \n\nThe service was fantastic the second time. The first time we had one primary server and a handful of other servers bringing up dishes and describing them. It's kind of cute and if it's efficient I guess that's how they like to work. I know they pool tips anyways but I like to tip based on one server. Old school.", "author": "Lisa Q."}

The food was good, but just.. nothing special in my opinion. I guess it's because there wasn't a dish that I'd want to come back for? I wish we had tried the Jewish-Style Artichokes that everyone is raving about, but instead we ordered:\n\n-Grilled Octopus (Puntarelle, Potatoes, Olives, Marjoram, $15): Good, but the octopus wasn't quite as tender as I like and have had in the past. I also felt like the potatoes were out of place, and wished there were more olives instead.\n-Fried Castelvetrano Olives ($6): Pretty good. The breadcrumb crust was crispy, and the olives were tender and stuffed with cheese.\n-Rigatoni alla Carbonara (Guanciale, Egg, Pecorino, Black Pepper, $15): Eh.. the rigatoni was good, but the sauce need a little more salt. However, the chucks of guanciale were SUPER salty, and too big for the dish. I would skip this.\n-Chesnut-Ricotta Agnolotti (Amaro, Sage, Brown Butter, Parmigiano, $17): My friends really liked this dish, but I felt like I've had better pastas in the past with a brown butter sage sauce. I also didn't like the hard texture of the agnolotti.\n-Oxtails alla Vaccinara ($24): Pretty good, but on the salty side. I felt like this dish was really plain, since it just had 2 large pieces of oxtail and 1 small piece, and then maybe 4 pieces of sliced celery? However, still one of the best dishes of the night.\n-Roasted Squash (Brown Butter, Calabrian Chili, $8): Pretty good, but nothing special.\n-Red Rome Apple Zeppole (Apple-Angostura Caramel, $8): Disappointing. There were five tiny zeppole balls, and a tiny drizzle of the caramel sauce. It had a good apple taste and the caramel tasted good, but the presentation really sucked. Not worth $8.\n\nOverall, I had higher expecations, which has been my problem when dining at restaurants lately.

Why? Let's start with the bar. The cocktail menu is great - rotating selections, some good standbys, but the drinks do tend to veer a touch to the sweet side for my liking. No matter, with a huge wall of about every apertif and liquor imaginable, and a head bartender that knows his way around the whole thing, ordering off-menu is as much a boozy adventure as it is delicious. There's plenty of delicious salty snacks to go with the drinks as well, the fried olives (filled with cheese!) are particularly great for soaking up that third mezcal-based concoction you probably didn't need.\n\nThe decor is worth mentioning as well - they're trying to channel Rome, and do a pretty damn good job of it. The lighting and flooring toward the back of the restaurant tends to look a bit cheaper compared to the rest (especially the neon-esque wall lighting), but the tile walls, vintage concert posters in the bathrooms, and exposed kitchen are all very well executed - understated and well-designed without trying to hard.\n\nService and food continue the trend - knowledgable waitstaff, great wine list, and food that really hits the spot. Only complaint about the food is that some dishes can get a little oily, and the carbonara is a bit on the salty side (but I mean, come on, it's carbonara). The complementary \"pizza\" (focaccia) is phenomenal, doubly so if you get the non-complementary appetizer version grilled with toppings. \n\nAll-around, an awesome swiss army knife of a place - drinks at the bar with snacks, dinner, or even a nightcap after eating elsewhere, you'd have to try really hard to go wrong with Locanda.", "author": "Judd B."}

INSANE! This is far the trendiest California-Roman restaurant on Valencia and goes head to head with Flour + Water. You know these restaurants are the shit when other chefs come to eat here after work. They play great music, foodies everywhere, an extensive bar, and a modern setting. If its the same owner as Delfina, you will certainly be impressed! I will save you time and get right to the chase. We were four people and had gone to Dalva just before for cocktails. What we ordered was the perfect amount. Just take in mind that the plates are small and you have to order at least 2-3 appetizers. Have some wine, cocktails, or a \"Mexican\" coke. Here is what I recommend (5 mini stars for my favorite): \n\nL' Antipasto:\nJEWISH STYLE ARTICHOKES *****\nPIZZA BIANCA\n**The bread they serve is incredible!!!!!! *****\n\nIl Secondo:\nVEAL CASONCELLI  alla SALTIMBOCCA\nFETTUCCINI - rabbit sugo, cicoria, verjus*****\nCAVATELLI- Ravioli filled with shrimp and burrata *****\nCRESCENZA TORTELLI - chantarelles, mint, pinenuts\n\nIl Dolce: \nRICOTTA FRITTA - citrus caramel, lemon thyme *****\nWARM CHOCOLATE CAKE -maple syrup, curried walnuts\n\nYou will be mind-blown, trust me.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

To the point that I'd not recommend booking. It could have been an off night or perhaps just what my date and I ordered but the food was seriously lacking.\n\nBACKGROUND: \nI'd heard wonderful things about this resto for quite a long time from a number of people I trust before finally making the journey to experience it for myself. I/we was/were super excited and, on entry, thoroughly expecting a great meal. \n\nTHE FOOD: \nMy date and I chose to share a number of dishes: \nLA QUERCIA PROSCIUTTO: WAY over salted. It so overwhelmed that none of the natural flavor came through and no amount of wine or water helped. \nPIZZA BIANCA: Nice flavor, well presented but it was rather stale (maybe over toasted and left to sit?). The actual taste was really nice and I could see this being wonderful if done properly. \nRIGATONI alla CARBONARA: Pasta was prepared nicely al dente, the overall favor was good but the guanciale was rubbery and the predominant seasoning was salt (see comments on prosciutto above). \nBERKSHIRE PORK SALTIMBOCCA: Lovely flavor and great taste while hot. As it cooled it became rather difficult to handle and seemed more like a breakfast ham. Again, a lot of salt though within context this was not make or break here.\nSMOKED MASHED POTATOES: Pretty tasty. \n\nSERVICE: \nOverall very nice and exactly what I expected from a restaurant with the reputation Locanda has. Team service, good explanations. Two minor comments: \n1. staff seemed overly hurried as if they were understaffed or trying to turn the table while also providing good service. Not sure if it was either of those or something else but it was noticeable. \n2. The table next to us had a tasting menu and when I inquired with a server, he sort of blew me off mentioning that it came from an app partner. Fair enough, but the menu looked far superior to what we were eating and if it was available I'd consider coming back to try it. \n\nTHE WRAP: \nCould have been an off night, could have been the dishes my date and I ordered, it could have been that we rubbed someone the wrong way, or anything else. However, based on last night's experience, I would not recommend booking here. There are so many tasty places in the city, better to try somewhere else.", "author": "Alan T."}

Because I walked in on a MONDAY night at 6pm (3 people in my party) and the hostess was like \"do you have a reservaaaaayyysun?\" Um, no. It's Monday night, do you have any openings? \"Computer says noooooo\". Then she proceeded to tell me it would be a 1.5-2 hours wait. I believed it, because the place was full. Full of pink-shirt-and-loafer Marina folk.  Unacceptable. I mean, a Mission gal should be able to go out for dinner in her own neighborhood on a Monday night. \n\nThe other reason I'm upset with Locanda is that during the day, the restaurant is a sterile, granite-slab-cold, shades-down dead-spot on Valencia street.

This was amazing but glad I was splitting it since the meat had a very strong salty taste that was excellent but could overpower if you ate too much.

It seems like the restaurant gets pretty busy, so I'd suggest making reservations here beforehand. \n\nWent here last Sat night with a friend around 7:20pm without a reservation. We had to wait about 40 mins, and we were seated promptly at 8pm on an actual table and not the bar. \n\nI was super craving pastas that night, and everything on their menu sounded amazing.  Locanda started us off with some complementary, perfectly toasted focaccia bread glazed with light olive oil. Then we proceeded to order the following:\n\nAPPETIZER\nPizza Bianca w/Smoked Bass, Horseradish, and Dill for $9 (4 stars): To start off, this is not to be confused for actual pizza because it is NOT. It's more like large pieces of crostini topped with various ingredients. Despite having a dislike for horseradish, I really enjoyed this dish! I really had my doubts... but the flavors of the smoked bass and horseradish complemented each other very well, and the thinly sliced dill on top made each bite very refreshing. Great start to the meal!\n\nMAIN DISHES - THE PASTAS\nLinguini with Dungeness Crab/Lettuce/Sorrel for $21 (4 stars): Delicious! Linguini is not my favorite pasta, but combined with dungeness crab? I'M THERE. The pasta was slightly wider than the average linguini noodle (probably why I liked it), cooked al dente, and there were tons of pieces of fresh crab meat in the dish. I ate the entire thing up, but I think I would've liked the sauce to be a little less oily. I was also thrown off a couple times by some small pieces of crab shell in the dish. Still tasty though!\n\nRadiatore with Lamb Ragu for $17 (rating: NA): My friend ordered this, but I had one bite. The texture of the pasta was good (Flour + Water was still way better), but I thought that the lamb flavor was a little too potent for the dish. Although I'm a huge fan of lamb, the flavor of the lamb seemed to detract from the other flavors of tomato, pecorino, and mint. It was still good though, and my friend devoured it all.\n\nBoth of us really enjoyed our food, but I definitely think the service could've used some improvement. The service was a little sporadic... Our waiter was super slow at times, especially when taking our orders and giving us the check. But he did come back pretty often to fill our water glasses. \n\nTo wrap up -- Locanda, your food impressed me (even though your service did not), but I still look forward to coming back and seeing what other types of pastas and appetizers you have to offer!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Fantastic space, great bar, hip drinks and friendly bar staff. After the drinks, the night went south. What started as a birthday dinner out with my partner (we were so excited after waiting over a month for a res), ended with a lousy table near the door, aloof service and food that was nothing special. \n\nAs an italian, I was excited to have some authentic Roman cuisine. Instead, we had food that was ordinary. The grilled carciofi was really tasty with arugula and ricotta salata and the house bread was really good. But it took over 30 minutes to get the amatriciana that could have been prepared at home and it would have been just as good. The fish and bavette came later and by that time we were just plain hungry. Beef was ok and the fish was dry. Didn't bother with dessert since we had been there for over 2 and a half hours by now and were so under whelmed it didnt seem worth it. \n\nI know that owners of the \"hot spots\" have the advantage in the short term, as most of the younger $$ is spent in a place to see and be seen in. However, I'd encourage them to consider an important business principle - it is a privledge to serve your customers as opposed to acting as though it is a privledge for your customers to have the opportunity to spend an evening at your place.   \n\nNext time we'll skip the expensive, trendy place and stick to a great neighborhood restaurant like Vega in Bernal , with great food and friendly service that appreciates us locals.", "author": "phil b."}

I also tried my friend's carbonara that was no different in its quality than the one you can get at Trader Joes for quarter of the price (except maybe that at Locanda they cooked the pasta al dente as it should be). The smoked mashed potatoes dish was ok, but paying $9 for it was way too much (+tax +tip +5% that they shove down their customers throats just because they can).

She explained that she did not have a table at that time but could put us on the wait list.  We were then told to check back in 45 minutes.

Please note that the menu constantly changes due to the season. I feel like this place is an easy five stars because anything you order will look and taste great no matter what. There are interesting takes on certain dishes. It's something you can't get at home or anywhere else. Instant gratification in my book.\n\nThe interior is quite handsome with their chalk ash colored tables and semi minimal decor. It's like the place was created by an indie rocker, minimalist, and italian chef. The first thing I noticed was their striking piece of art depicting one mirrored wolf. Take a gander in the bathroom and you'll find that the mirror is made to resemble a window (it kinda feels like someone can peep in). These slight touches make the visit feel different and unique.\n\nThe only problem with this place is the noise level. It's as loud as a Chinese New Year parade when the dragons and firecrackers go off, but the noise is only coming from 25-40 year old trendy San Franciscans.

Their wine list is superb and their cocktails are tasty, but the food is over salted and just okay. I was not impressed, especially by the pastas.

A pretentious one. Being an ambulatory dyslexic, I also thought their marble letters on the front window spelled \"Lo Can-ada\". WelI...I was wrong about one thing for sure, the spelling but not the pretension. \n\nI had hands down the best dining experience in the Mission at Locanda. An old friend from home came to visit and we debated b/w Bar Tartine and Locanda. Both had 45 min wait and Locanda offered us a spot first so we had to blow off Bar Tartine--hard life as a foodie, I know. \n\nSince I was w/ my foodie soul mate, we went all out ordering the fried artichockes, the Lamb Scottadito, Linguini, chicken and grilled corn and zuchs. We finished off w/ dessert in the form fried dough puffs. Warning: the chef has a pretty heavy hand w/ the salt especially on the fried artichokes and linguini. The lamb was succulent and didn't have their usual funky lamb after taste. What threw me off was DA GRILLED CORN. Oh my lord, the corn was sooooo good. I've never tasted such savory corn before. Each kernal was grilled to perfection. Seriously, out of everything the corn was unforgettable. \n\nMy friend who works in the restaurant industry was impressed by their wine selection especially the dessert wine. They have a wide selection of dessert wine fermented in bitters. A couple we tried were: Montenegro Bologna, Ciao Ciaro, Lazio, and Jelineck Fernet. To be honest , the Montenegro was the only palatable one b/c it was super sweet and citrusy whereas the rest were just bitter. My palate still needs a little training in the wine department. Regardless of the lack of functional signage, I will be backkkk.", "author": "Bo R."}

Glad we finally made it.  \n\nWent in on a Thursday night, 9:30 res.  Arrived a little early, hoping to get seated cause we were starving.  No luck.  Scored one seat at the bar and ordered cocktails.  A glass of Pinot, Agro Uve: (Grappa, Peach, Lemon, Egg, Bitters) and La Bella Confusione, bartenders choice:  Vodka, Elderflower, bitters...a Vodka Collins like drink (the perfect cocktail for a hot day).  The clear winner.  Our evening was off to a great start.\n\nThere are lots of things on the menu that looked interesting to us.  A good sign when you're trying a place for the first time.  Our server Emma did a great job making suggestions and helping us navigate.  We started with the Jewish Style artichoke, perfectly crisp.  Pizza Blanca, not really a pizza but more of a crostini.  4 pieces of crust topped with a white bass/fresh horseradish/dill topping that was amazing.  After our great dinner at Commonwealth, we're loving sweetbreads at the moment.  We ordered the fried sweetbreads and artichokes.  Yum!  They were perfectly cooked and really sweet topped with fried herbs and a sprinkle of sea salt.  They quickly disappeared.  The house made crusty focaccia bread was really great, we ate 2 plates!  \n\nFor main courses we ordered Lamb Scottadito:  rack of lamb cooked medium rare nicely seasoned.  2 bones.  Halibut collar with Earl Gray and Early girl tomatoes.  The fish was moist and well cooked, good flavor.  The clear winner for us was the Beef Cheek Ravioli.  Amazing flavor in a buttery sauce.  A hearty fall dish I would go back for.  The portions were all on the small side.  In hindsight, we should have ordered sides to go with our dinner.  I got the ravioli, which was perfect for me, but for the guys, they wanted a little more.  Lesson learned.  We did get a ricotta fritter to share for dessert.  It came with a citrus caramel sauce that was really tasty.  \n\nDefinitely a place to go back to.  The food interesting and flavorful.  The cocktails new and different.  The place has a great vibe and is visually stunning.  The menu changes weekly so there's always something new to try out.", "author": "Kim A."}

(I think the people without reservations only had the bar option.) \n\nI liked the space, but it was a little loud and warm back where we were seated. The waiter didn't hesitate to suggest his favorite pasta when I asked, so I went with his recommendation and ordered the fettuccine with rabbit sugo. It was basically a braised rabbit with dandelion greens and fettuccine and the sauce was the \"jus\" from the braising. It was a good dish. \n\nI'm not drinking alcohol right now, so I tried the cucumber limeade, which was delicious. It was refreshing and more on the tart side than the sweet side. My only beef was that my dinner partner ordered wine and they poured that immediately. Then they brought out our dishes pretty quickly after we ordered, but I still hadn't received my drink (again, no alcohol and on the rocks) and had to inquire about it. \n\nAfter we'd eaten and our dishes had been cleared, there was a little confusion when my friend and I thought the waiter asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu, but he brought us the regular menu. I guess we hadn't heard him say \"savory\" menu. Why would we want to see the savory menu again after we'd already eaten our meal? \n\nAnyway, we ended up ordering the chocolate cake with whipped cream on the side. I really wish we'd gone with the waiter's recommendation for dessert and ordered either the fig crostata or the fried ricotta because those sounded a lot more interesting than chocolate cake, but my dining companion wasn't having it. Her main meal consisted of an appetizer salad with a small amount of albacore and was stuffed from that, so I had to defer to her. \n\nAs with my drink, there was a major holdup with our chocolate cake and we finally had to ask about it because we thought they'd forgotten it. The waiter apologized for the holdup and deducted the $9 from our check at the end of the meal because of the wait. I was glad because the cake was OK, but nothing that I'd order again. It wasn't memorable like the chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream from Frances! \n\nAll in all we had a pleasant experience. The space was attractive, my meal was good, and the waiter was knowledgeable and friendly. I'm just not sure if it was a memorable meal. I might come back with a couple of people who actually eat food at a meal so we could try a few other things on the menu.", "author": "Kimberly B."}

It's a concept that seems to work! \n\nHeaded there for date night with my partner (it was a Friday) and 2 hours later, came away with an experience that was somewhere between \"WOW\". \"ER-OK\" and \"MEH\".\n\nWhat made it \"WOW\"?\n- Yes, hands down the food was THE winner. We had the Jewish Style Artichoke and Pizza Bianca for an appetizer and I highly recommend both! Pasta we had was the Bucatini all 'Amatriciana which we shared (the dish was spicy which we both loved but dayum! it was a tad bit oily but maybe when you're a Roman warrior all you do is indulge?!). I had the Bavette Steak and my partner had the Lamb Scottadito which were both really, really good! Dessert was the Warm Chocolate Cake which was a winner again!\n- And the wine list is to die for!! If you're a wine lover, this place has it all!\n- Kudos to the chef for some really excellent food and wine!\n\nWhat made it \"ER-OK\"?\n- As some of the other reviews mentioned, the music tended to go loud one minute and quiet the next and we never quite got the hang of that\n- Maybe our eyes are going (after all, I'm 32!) but the mood lighting also did the same thing i.e. bright one minute, dim the next. \n- Guessing since its a new place, everyone is making a bee-line for it and that made the noise level close to unbearable. If noise make you cream your pants, this place is good. But if noise makes your flag go to half-mast, this place is not the best.\n\nWhat made it \"MEH\"?\nWe got seated soon as we arrived and then we had a 15 minute wait before we got our menus. Then about a 10 minute wait before the waitress came to take our wine order. Then about another 10 minute wait before the waitress came to take our food order. And during that time, we noticed about 5 to 6 wait staff just milling around looking for something to do. Of course, while we were mid-way through dessert the waitress came to ask if there was anything else we wanted and we had not even finished our dessert and the check was on our table...as Bon Qui-Qui from SNL would have said \"R-U-D-E!\".\n\nLong story short, the food is different, rich and an experience albeit a bit pricey and the wine list is exhaustive! Ambience is busy, loud, hipsterish and a bit tight at times. Service (right from the host to the wait staff) is something they definitely need to work on.\n\nWe'll probably give it another shot one the fanfare dies down and we can sit and enjoy a good meal.", "author": "Amit S."}

And I don't think that non-entree sized pasta dishes should be $17.  Pasta costs like, 30 cents...not sure where the markup comes in.  If you want to charge that much for pasta, it should be a entree sized portion (and I'm not just being a big fat American here, our server specifically told us that the pasta was not entree sized and recommended we order two).\n\nOverall, we really enjoyed our meal but maybe our next visit will be on someone else's tab.", "author": "Kristin P."}

If you're a guy, plan on ordering both the pasta and an entree, and maybe a side (approx. $50). In spite of eating next to nothing (no alcohol, no dessert), our meal came out to nearly $100. We didn't even bother ordering more food because it wasn't sufficiently tasty to justify the added costs.\n\nThe hostesses, though, were extremely sweet and helpful. Sadly, their extra star is canceled out by the somewhat contemptuous and unhelpful waiter.", "author": "Anonymous F."}

I wonder how it is so popular.  I wondered the same about Dubstep.  Were people tricked into liking both?  What this tells me is that most people have shit taste in food and otherwise. And that the \"popularity\" of a restaurant is no indicator of how good the food will be. \n\nI was SO excited to try this place out. I made a reservation weeks in advance, I got a babysitter for the children, I got dressed up, I was filled with joy and anticipation.  I am a huge Delfina fan and eat there at least once a month, and eat at Delfinas Pizza at least once per week. So you can imagine how excited I was for a new Delfina restaurant.   I never imagined how dissapointed I would be.\n\nFirst, we got there and were seated in a small table by the front.  It was not a bad table, but it was right next to the air conditioning vent and the AC was on FULL BLAST.  I was FREEZING.  Thank goodness this is San Francisco and I usually carry a jacket and sweater with me, but the cold air was unbearable.  I ended up having to cover the vent with my jacket and purse.  And when I mentioned something to our waitress she smiled and did nothing about it.  She didn' turn it down or try to re-seat us.  Even my husband was cold sitting at that table. We both ended up having to put on our sweaters, and even then we both wished we had a blanket. \n\nI ordered the 12 lettuce salad and it was ok.  I liked the flavor of the greens, but it was OVERDRESSED. It was drenched. It made the lettuce soggy. There is NO excuse to overdress a salad, especially not at a Delfina restaurant. Especially not when you are paying $9 for a small plate of lettuce.  \n\nI also ordered the Halibut collar and it was UNDERCOOKED.  There is no excuse for that. You would immediately go home if you were on Top Chef, darling. Don't serve me undercooked fish.  How can you be so popular yet not know how to cook fish properly?\n\nThe green pasta I had (lima beans and ricotta) was so so. It was honestly a little dry.  \n\nI was totally unimpressed. While I love Delifina's and it's sister pizza restaurant, I was so dissapointed with my experience at Locanda, that I will never go back, and that makes me sad, because I was really looking for a new favorite place to eat at.\n\n\nEDIT:  Laconda is now one of my very favorite restaurants EVER!  I was wrong, oh so wrong. Actually I wrote this review after going to the restaurant shortly after it opened, so maybe it took them a minute to get things right.  And they did.  It is, oh so right now.\n\nI go there a bunch now.  I look forward to it.  I plan for it.  It is my favorite date night restaurant.  I ALWAYS get the Crezenssa (spelling?) ravioli.  I cannot describe how good they are.  They are these cheese filled ravioli in a mushroom sauce with pine nuts I think.  When you bite into the ravioli the hot and liquid cheese explodes in your mouth (in the best way possible) and fills your taste buds with ecstasy.  I am hard pressed to think of a better pasta dish I have ever had in my life.  \n\nMy husband always gets the fish aqua pazza; the crazy water fish.  It is cooked to perfection.  The crazy water is just that- some sort of indiscernible sauce that is so crazy good you will want to drink your plate.   I also highly recommend the olives appetizer.  \n\nThe drinks are really good, though seriously pricey. I feel like they can slow it down on that tip- charging $15 for a mixed drink is frankly almost offensive.   The atmosphere is light and fun.  \n\nSo yeah, please disregard my previous review and fucking GO TO LACONDA.  You won't regret it.", "author": "Ivanna C."}

The ambiance is modern and perfect for people watching.  Which is all you can do because it is so loud you can't talk with your friends.\n\nOur table was right in front of the door, which kept opening allowing for chill air to come blowing in.  They need to install a curtain to help solve this problem.  The service is mediocre at best, our waitress, took quite a while before greeting us, she came to take our appetizer order and left so quickly we weren't able to order drinks.  The restaurant appears somewhat understaffed.  Once I did get a cocktail order in it came long after appetizers were served.  However, the aperitivo and anniversario cocktails are tasty.\n\nIn terms of food, the Pizza Bianca and Jewish Style Artichokes (although very small) were delicious.  I ordered the linguini with lambs, they describe the sauce as \"light\", however \"light\" actually translates to bland.  My husband ordered the lamb, which was tasty, however, it is very small.  He left hungry.  I was also able to try the sole, which a friend ordered, also so simple it seemed bland.  The side order of carrots are incredible and absolutely worth it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-05-30", "description": "There is potential. Definitely. But at the moment, this place does not live up to all the hype it was able to muster. Trying to explain:\n\nservice-wise\n~~~~~~~~~~\nso I am somewhat conflicted: There are a few awesome guys there - nice and kind and accommodating and with a sense of humor, only they weren't in charge of our table nor where they the hosts, and the service did have its quarks.. For example, although I said that as long as its EVOO I don't care much, the dessert menu came stained with oil...\nAlso, they were so anxious that we leave, that we got the \"do you need anything else?\" question in the middle of dessert and the check a second later.\n\n\nfood-wise \n~~~~~~~~\nI don't mean to be insulting, but the experience on the aggregate is that the food is good, and I really don't think that this is where they are aiming...  But the dishes are not consistent in their level, some great, some no more than mediocre. So on a great to mediocre index:\n\nsweetbreads. lovely (to the extent you can think of offal in those terms), tender, juicy, perfectly balanced sweet/salty, fritto-misto version of sweetbreads.\n\njewish style artichoke. deep fried. crispy. aesthetic == (or as good as) fried ricotta balls dessert. caramel-citrus. delicate.\n \nveal saltimbocca pasta.. this dish is the threshold between worth ordering and not so much.\n\ncarciofi with ricotta and avocado .. this dish had some interesting aspects to it like the raw carciofi, but the bottom line is that the components didn't quite work well with one another. My companion thought that the entire dish was negatively unripe, but I think that unripe was the positive aspect, which probably means it was interesting enough to merit a debate.\n\nthe anchovy pasta which we were forewarned was spicy. Now spicy I love, less so do I love attempts on my life... Still, I did derive some masochistic pleasure from the dish. But, such level of spiciness does require something to balance it out so that you can rest in between murderous bites. \n\nlimoncello. Subpar. Too high a level of alcohol, too low a level of lemon. \n\nAnother comment: the portions for both pastas where downright stingy, even for primis. (e.g. the anchovy was almost untraceable by an eye which is not behind a telescope)\n\ndecor-wise\n~~~~~~~~~\nI would rethink the artwork. \n\n\nHaving said all that... If after this review they'd still let me in, I will give this place a couple more shots. Maybe what I've experienced are just quarks due to the rawness of this place. Yeah... maybe it just needs a little more cooking.", "author": "tal n."}

And like, if the food is good, the price should be besides the point or something, right?  But then I got to thinking how so many 4 or 5 star restaurants on Yelp are $$$, and how maybe, just maybe, we rate them more highly because we literally invested more in them (this is a thing, it's called cognitive dissonance). \n\nOkay, anyway, before I psychoanalyze all of Yelp's users, let me say that the shrimp burrata pasta dish (cuscini) is great. Definitely recommend it. That on its own is worth coming in again for. Buttery, cheesy, flavorful deliciousness. I like the complimentary bread they give too. And the ricotta fritta dessert is pretty cool.\n\nIn general the dishes are very rich here. I found the poached duck egg appetizer a little *too* buttery. I didn't find the albacore interesting enough. Everything was good, but just not amazing. People rave about the Jewish style artichoke here, but like, it's a fried artichoke. C'mon people. Hard to screw that up.\n\nI do have to applaud Locanda for the superb service -- we had really awesome waitstaff and bartenders. I enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the bartenders do their thing, and it's just nice to feel like you're being taken care of. And unlike some other places that are popular and get quite busy, the receptionists were really helpful in pointing us to spots at the bar that were about to open up when we found out there were no tables available for another 2 hrs (got there a bit before 8pm on a Wednesday).\n\nTo sum up, while I had a tasty meal, it wasn't the most delicious one I've had in recent weeks, and yet was easily the most expensive.

The cocktails were probably the star of the meal -- I think what we had were called Kentucky Maids? -- and I kept wanting more.

The salad of arugula, avocado, and ricotta was good, but not great.  \n\nThe pastas we had were pretty good also, but there was nothing too exciting on the menu.  Our two friends both had the bucatini, which was cooked perfectly and had a nice tomato-guanciale sauce.  I ordered the radiatore with a very nice lamb-mint ragu, and I loved my dish.  Sadly, however, the most adventurous dish we ordered was the least successful.  The description said (other than the pasta name, which we did not know), only said \"gulf shrimp, burrata,\" which sounded great.  Unfortunately, the pasta pillows that we got were overly fishy, and our least favorite dish of the night.  My wife actively disliked the dish.  \n\nAgain, I loved my pasta, but the bad dish that my wife got, combined with the somewhat unexciting menu, means that it doesn't rank up there with some of our favorite places.

One of the best tapas restaurants in SF and my go-to Sunday brunch, I've been waiting to see what would happen there next.  Well, the fine folks from Delfina took the space and turned it into a Roman Osteria.\n\nThe ambiance is certainly much lighter than the Ramblas days. The room feels much more open and far larger. Emeco (Starck) stools, etched glass water bottles...the little touches are all there to offer a hip experience and not overly fussy. Despite this being opening night...yep, other than a friends and family soft opening this was the first real night open...the service was spot on. Friendly, excited and efficient. I was really surprised how well they had it down. On the other hand, the owners are old hands now at running a popular SF restaurant. Now the food.\n\nI'll say straight off that the Casarecce alla Carbonara (guanciale, egg, pecorino, black pepper) might be the best Carbonara in the city. Just perfect. The Lane (rabbit sugo, dandelion greens, verjus) was perhaps just a bit less successful...it arrived at the table just luke warm. The salad - Insalata Misticanza (12 greens, aceto, xvoo) was fine. Of the half dozen red wines offered by the glass we selected the 2007 Leone Conti Sangiovese and it was fine.\n\nLocanda seems to have it nailed. Given this was opening night and everything was already so good, I expect by end of summer this place will be yet another impossible table to get in SF. Well done.", "author": "Gary C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-12", "description": "Earlier this week I went to dinner at Locanda, a restaurant that despite its high profile location (16th and Valencia) I hadn't heard much about. It opened in April 2011 and is run by the same owners as Delfina. I knew I'd like it right off the bat since its logo is an artichoke. I had decided to go there for dinner after scanning 7X7's list of \"100 Things to Eat Before You Die\" and the Jewish style artichokes at Locanda popped out to me. How does one make Jewish style artichokes? And why had I not heard of this before?\n\nTurns out they're fried, herb-seasoned and delicious. But let me start from the beginning. Walking into Locanda, it has the similar atmosphere of its neighbors in the Mission.  It was darker, primarily candlelit and had bar and open kitchen spanning the length of the restaurant. After assessing the menu, we settled on calling it an Italian Roman fusion. Pretty much every antipasti on the menu looked delicious so we went for a wide variety. On top of the Jewish style artichokes, which were an obvious must, we also went with the king salmon crudo, shaved artichoke salad, egg and asparagus, grilled pizza bianca and peas and shoots. Let's start with the last. We ordered the peas and shoots as we'd heard the owner requires the wait staff to say one of his favorite jokes, \"peas shoot, peas score\" whenever serving the pea shoots. Sadly our server did not, but with the spring onion and straus yogurt mixed in, they were still the most flavorful pea side dish I've ever had. My least favorite starter (and let me caveat that this just means it was the least amazing) was the king salmon crudo. I liked that it was topped with salted capers and kept simple with a little xvoo. Unfortunately it lacked the acidity that really makes a crudo sing. The asparagus was not lacking in flavor, as it was topped with a poached egg, bottarga (cured fish roe) and burro nero (butter), finished off with crunchy breadcrumbs. Outside of the Jewish style artichoke, my favorite was the pizza Bianca, while was charred bread topped with an amazing amount of burrata, herbs and oil. It sounds so simple on paper but if you saw it in person you would understand. Even the basic bread brought for the table was anything but basic. It was fresh out of the grill, doused in olive oil and topped with sea salt.\n\nBut back to the artichokes. The shaved artichoke salad was mixed with arugula and avocado but what really brought it a step above other shaved salads I've had was the grilled ricotta. Usually when I have ricotta it's in its softer form but this was the hard cheese. And grilling it added this great smoky flavor to the cheese. It turns out Jewish style artichokes (carciofi all giudia) are a delicacy from the olden Roman days. The artichokes are fried in oil with their leaves out-turned, making them look like sunflower. The whole, fried artichokes is seasoned with herbs, lemon, salt and pepper. They're crunchy, flavorful and another fun way to enjoy artichokes.\n\nFor my main dish I ordered the chicken, which could be perceived as boring, but it was wrapped in pancetta and stuffed with some form of herbs. It was some of the most perfectly cooked chicken I've ever had and the pancetta really held in the flavor and moistness. After checking out everyone else's dishes, I'd also recommend the pork spareribs based off looks and that that person's satisfaction level. I ducked out before dessert but was more than satisfied. I highly recommend this spot and plan to go back soon.", "author": "Larisa J."}

I made reservations the day before and luckily we were both able to make an early dinner at 5:30pm. If not, the next availability would have been at 10pm! I hear their normal dinner times between 6-9pm are booked for weeks ..maybe even months!\n\nOur waiter was amazing. Not only was he helpful, he was extremely patient with us since we had no idea what we wanted to order. But it was his helpful suggestions that got us through an amazing meal!\n\nSince we both love artichokes we had to order the Jewish Style Artichoke and the Artichoke Salad (Carciofi Crudi). Both were delicious! The Jewish Style was fried and crispy but not over done. The salad with grilled ricotta, wild arugula, and avocado was refreshing and zesty to contrast enough from the other dish. \n\nThen it was on to the sweetbreads & artichoke dish which was made with veal that night instead of lamb. I've never eaten sweetbreads before so I was definitely nervous, but our waiter described them to resemble a creamier version of a chicken nugget with a slightly chewier texture. Let me just say I not only survived the dish, I actually enjoyed it! His description couldn't have been more accurate! Who doesn't like chicken nuggets? Just think of them as the classier version with much more flavor!!\n\nOur pasta was up next. Since none of them really stuck out to us, we went with our waiter's suggestion again. This time we got adventurous with rabbit! Again, another first for me.  I like most meats except for ones that tend to be gamey like lamb, so I think this dish had to be THE MOST nerve racking for me.  Result? Success! Now I know that I can eat rabbit anyday over lamb! I've even concluded that this was my favorite dish of the night! The rabbit mixed with a bit of prosciutto and fettuccini was absolutely amazing. \n\nAs if we didn't eat enough between the two of us, we ended our main courses with the hen. It was wrapped with some sort of cured meat (now I cant remember if it was prosciutto or bacon) but I have to say this was the least memorable of all the dishes. It was good, but our palettes might have been fooded out by this time. It definitely wasn't dry, but I don't recall it being juicy either.  \n\nTo finish off the meal we chose the Strawberry Crostata. Since strawberries are in season now, it was the perfect ending to our meal.\n\nLocanda, I will be back again! Hopefully sooner than later!\n\nTIP: Book your reservations asap and definitely listen to your waiter. I wish I remembered his name, but whoever you are, thank you!! :)", "author": "Kristen C."}

Valencia street is filled with tons of amazing restaurants but Locanda is not one of them.  We ordered the Jewish Artichokes as advertised (2 orders of them to be safe).  When they reached the table we thought the second order would be coming out shortly given the tiny portion but alas we were wrong.  The artichokes themselves were shriveled and oversalted, nothing special, and each one was only half an artichoke to boot!  Outrageous!  And this was only a sign of things to come.\n\nI was with a group at dinner.  Some of us ordered pasta dishes.  I have never in my life seen a pasta dish where the serving did not even cover the entire plate.  The pasta dishes at Locanda barely covered two thirds of the plate.  It's not like there were any special ingredients in the pasta, just pasta and red or white sauce.  \n\nIt get's better.  My girlfriend ordered the oxtail stew.  You would think there would actually be oxtail in the stew.  No!  Instead there were only mushrooms and eggs and an oxtail broth (as the waiter was kind enough to explain when we asked her).  The menu was a total lie!\n\nI ordered the Leg of Lamb, the coup de gras!  27 dollars.  It came with three slices of carved lamb.  No bone.  No leg in sight.  And it didnt even come with a side dish.  Next to the lamb were slices of lettuce, drenched in the same sauce as the lamb itself.  Unbelievable.  \n\nWe asked the manager to explain what we had ordered and she tried to defend the lies on the menu (and the lies that the waiter had told us when we asked for a description of the oxtail stew).  She was extraordinarily unhelpful.  She even had the gall to tell us that Locanda is comparable to other restaurants in the area!  Give me a break.

Left my drink fate in his hands and let him make me a Bartender's Choice cocktail...again...and again...and again. First was a magical ginger concoction, followed by a lemon-peach infused glass of deliciousness...and so on it went. Very happy (albeit tipsy) girl. \n\nWe grabbed a few light bites including the CARCIOFI CRUDI (artichokes) with grilled ricotta, wild arugula and avocado. Amazing.

We had an 8:30 reservation, and there were six of us. We were seated at 9pm at a teeny tiny table. You know how you can push two tables together to comfortably seat four? Well, if you turn the tables the other way, you can seat more people across, making it longer but more narrow. That's what happened to us. It was awkward and small (it was me and five dudes), especially once the appetizers, bread, wine, and water all had to cram into the same narrow space. If you don't have room for us, you don't have room for us, but we had a reservation and it shouldn't have been an issue. I worked as a hostess for a long time when I was younger, and this was clearly just bad planning. I wish that they'd given us the option to wait for a bigger table (it had already been half an hour--what's another fifteen minutes at that point?), but the staff didn't seem concerned.\n\nThe green tomato soup was my favorite thing of the meal, but the pasta was SO DISAPPOINTING. I got ricotta bucattini, and they did not taste fresh. I'm guessing that this could have been due to the fact that we ended up only eating at 9:30, and perhaps they were made earlier in the day and left out or something. Anyways, it was really sad because I hardly ever eat pasta and I had been SO looking forward to something fresh and tasty. I ate exactly a third of my dish and filled up on the (delicious) bread.\n\nIf I ever come back, I'll just have bread, soup, and a glass of wine.\n\nFlour + Water, you win this round.", "author": "Jenny M."}

This was 3 twists the size of mini donuts. Salty, piggy, and quite delicious. A bit pricey at $5. \n\nRADIATORE \"PECORA e PECORINO\" -lamb ragu, pecorino, mint. The flavors were intense and delicious. Just great with every bite. The pasta was almost too al dente, right on the edge for me. The portion size was okay, but I would have liked more, and I thought that $17 for pasta was maybe $3 more than I wanted to pay.\n\nPeas & Pea Shoots \"Vignarola\". This was a good-sized portion of peas in and out of the pod, and some greens. I didn't see any pea shoots, though the greens may have been that. They were lightly cooked, with a brothy light sauce. Very refreshing. \n\nDessert: RICOTTA FRITTA with citrus caramel, lemon thyme. These were little balls of fried dough with ricotta inside. They had a nice light citrus flavor, and the ricotta was creamy. 7 balls for $9. \n\nThey have local wines on tap and European wines by the bottle. \n\nI was very happy with my late dinner here, and would be a regular if only the prices were slightly lower. As it is, I will definitely check back in a month or 2 when they have all the kinks worked out, and I'm hoping that they'll be 5 star by then.", "author": "Jacob L."}

Considering the big push in SF to have really well made drinks, these were subpar in comparison to Bar Ag or Beretta.  At $12 a pop, even for a basic gin and tonic on the second round, I think they must have a pretty expensive lease that they need to cover.\n\nFood wise, as it was about 10:30 when I ate, I really only had one main dish.  It was good, but the portion was a bit small, considering it was pasta.  Would I order it again, more than likely.\n\nService wise.  Tough one.  When we sat down, my friend exclaimed how starving he was.

That's too bad, given the Delfina pedigree and how innovative and interesting things read on the menu. Somehow the food fell short of what I hoped it would be. The one exception was the rabbit sugo, which was incredible. (That dish alone made me consider moving the meal up from three to four stars.) \n\nWe ordered:  the fried duck egg;  the sugo; the halibut cheek; and the tripe. \n\nThe halibut cheek was nicely cooked, but underseasoned. I get that subtlety is key with a dish that fatty/silky, but this went beyond subtlety into absence. I hadn't tried tripe since childhood. I didn't like it then, but something made me think that I'd like the flavor as an adult. And I probably would have. But the pieces were cut so small that I really could have been eating anything. Tiny bits are probably the best way to get tripe tender and palatable, but when they're this small the flavor gets lost. The duck egg was good, not awesome. Maybe the brown butter egg dish at Cotogna has spoiled me. \n\nFor a place that just opened, Locanda was solid and I was happy to have gone. Still, plenty of room for improvement.

But I'm only interested in food so here we go...artichoke app and a grilled ricotta salad were fine, but nothing over the top.  For one of the most popular dishes there, I'd expect more.  4 pasta dishes at the table, and they were average at best.  The pasta was cooked fine, but the sauces were just average.  My lobster spaghetti had the most watered down bland tomato sauce I've had (the lobster was actually undercooked but that didn't matter to me).  Honestly, I make a sauce that blows this out of the water.  Please don't pull some 'you have to appreciate the delicate flavor of lobster' crap on me either, the sauce should speak for itself plain and simple.  Sidekick got a vege mushroom pasta that was OK.  Old person #1 got a clam pasta...funny thing was we just made a clam pasta two days earlier...ours won.  Old person #2 got the carbonara...rich and acceptable, but again...average.\n\nPricing wasn't bad...$160 for 4 people, 2 apps, 4 mains, 3 drinks, and 1 desert.  Perhaps it's the slew of 20-something start up douche's with money and undeveloped taste buds calling the shots, or looks over substance (omg have restaurants become like dates?), but I've been peeved at the new eateries popping up in this city at this price point.  This falls into line with a Flour + Water, or A16.  If you like them (I hated both), you'll probably love this.

I obviously had been hoping to get a variety of pastas. Also, the portions were tiny for around $15.\n\nFor entrees we got the lamb shoulder and the short ribs. The lamb shoulder was actually more like 1/4 of a lamb shoulder, no bone, and spread into 4 tiny pieces on the place with some baby carrots. Flavor was alright but for $26 I felt completely gypped. \nI ordered the short ribs because I absolutely love short ribs - they could be my favorite way to eat beef. I love how they fall of the bone and are so tender. However, what came to our table was KOREAN short ribs. Totally different in every way. Not only did the menu not mention they were korean-style short ribs, but there was also no description, and as Locanda is an ITALIAN restaurant, I could never, ever have expected the short ribs to be korean short ribs. I was really shocked.  Also there was about 3 mouthfuls of meat on the whole $24 plate, and definitely more bone than meat. Honestly, it was ridiculous.\n\nLocanda's really only shining point is their cocktails, which are delicious.\n\nI really hate to write a bad review, and that Locanda made me start a Yelp account, but I felt the need to complain and it was bothering me.

It was my brother's birthday and I thought it would be a great choice since the 1st time we went here, it was great.  Not sure if we hit it on an off night, but it was totally UNDERWHELMING.  It ended up being $140 person (given we ate and drank quite a bit).  The thing that killed me is that the entrees came out piecemeal over the span of 10 minutes!  For that kind of money, they better bring the entrees within a few minutes of each other.  I feel ripped off.  And the food was soooo salty I almost couldn't eat it.  Keep in mind that my brother is a chef and loves his food \"seasoned\" so I'm accustomed to salty food.  I barely ever write bad Yelp reviews, but I just had to do it this time.  I really hope they see this review and address the issues.  I'd hate to see it go downhill.", "author": "Meredith B."}

We were barely greeted by our waiter who was rude, arrogant, and never explained anything to us. Extremely rude and seriously ruined the experience for us. He made it obvious he did not want to serve us and was unhappy to be there and it showed through his service throughout our meal. \n\nThe food on the other hand was excellent. We started off with a Pizza Bianca with figs and prosciutto which were sweet and savory, a very nice twist to a pizza. We also had the infamous (courtesy of yelp) the fried artichoke, which were so good that it tasted like fries! \n\nOur pastas were rich and tasty. I had the rabbit fettuccine, the others had the veal Saltimbocca and a lamb pasta. All the pastas were handmade, fresh and was overall very good. \n\nDesserts were also very good, we had the watermelon dish and the chocolate cake. \n\nI would easily give this a 4 star review, but our horrific waiter was just terrible. Didn't clear our tables promptly, didn't pour our wine, didn't even check on us. Although he did fail to charge corkage for our bottle, which was a win.

The scene and atmosphere was very busy and modern, yet relaxing and comfortable. Agreeing with previous reviews, it seems a bit premature to review a place after one visit, however we did our best to try as much as possible and experience one or two items in each area of the menu paired with wine from their suggested list. \n\nThe service was above par, which is to be expected for a place this new and under the Stoll name (think Delfina). We enjoyed the various wine on tap, which certainly isn't new, nor exclusive to Locanda, but an increasing trend which I find efficient and accommodating for the different flavors you will experience at a place like Locanda. \n\nStarting with a delightful poached egg and asparagus dish along with the facoli con cotiche, we followed with their fusilli and veal antipasti dish. All of which were very enjoyable.\n\nFor the entree, we shared the steak bavette which, quite frankly, was not the highlight of the meal.

The atmosphere is definitely trendy and it seems to be a new 'hot spot' as it was packed and had a hip vibe to it.  We went with a group of three and tried a bit of everything.  Started with two signature cocktails while we waited for our table, the Apertivo (Campari, Orange, Lemon and Prosecco) and the Santa Rosa Smash (Plum, Bourbon and Pinot Noir).  They were both delicious, unique, and generous pours.  \n\nFor appetizers- we had the flatbread pizza with crushed fava beans, arugula and cucumber.  It was so delicious this morning I am still thinking about it.  We also shared two salads (Ricotta arugula and little gem).  Both were perfectly dressed with a good balance of flavor.  Oh another thing- the bread they bring for the table is amazing!  Can't forget that.  \n\nThe only reasons I am giving Locanda 4 stars are: 1.)They ran out of the artichokes for appetizers.  We had a 7:30 reservation so it was pretty early to be out, and 2.) I didn't love my entree and my girlfriend didn't love hers either.  I had the Sepia which is basically a skewer of grilled, breaded calamari, and she had the steak.  The Sepia was pretty dry and tough.  The steak was not her favorite, she didn't like the texture or the seasoning.   \n\nWe did end with two deserts, the donuts and the chocolate cake both which I thought were very good, although I was stuffed at this point.\n\nOverall- lovely food, atmosphere, cocktails, and an amazing wine list.

They do things very italian here, dinner reservations can be made at 5:30, 10, 10:30, 11 or 11:30 I believe. Perfect in my book since I'm most hungry at bedtime.\n\nI forgot what I had but it was the spaghetti dish. There was sausage in it as well which I tend to not love. The dish comes and immediately I notice that the noodles look like they are made fresh at the restaurant (not sure if they are but I'll keep telling myself that). I finally get around to tasting the food after it cools a little and BAM - yup I was in carbohydrate heaven! I tried a few of my friends dishes as well and theres was REALLY good too.\n\nOnly downfall, its NOT ENOUGH! I wanted to order another one just cuz I'm a pig, but for normal people this should do the trick of filling you up (I just wanted to be stuffed with heaven). I also had the fernet drink which was really really good and highly recommended. Our waitress was very cool and very attentive. I did feel as if I were back in Italy with friends out in a piazza, but they did a good job of making the ambiance good. \n\nAfter about 11ish the place died down on a Friday night so it seems that you shouldn't have to worry too much with reservations if getting a \"late night\" eat.

I figure, surely those people know how to do Italian food.\n\nI guess the menu changes frequently so a pasta dish that a friend was ranting and raving about wasn't available the night I went.  We had the bucatini and rigatoni which were both good, but not great.  Pasta is al dente, but flavors are not robust and portions are fairly small.  It's not like I'm trying to carb load before a marathon, but I ate my entire bowl of pasta and was still hungry, which is very unusual.\n\nDrinks are very good- smoke n spice is wonderful and bartender's choice is interesting- you pick a liquor and they'll think up the rest.\n\nMaybe a good place to come with lots of people so you can sample more dishes and hopefully some of them will be spectacular, but mostly just average this time around.", "author": "Maxine S."}

When we had come in to have a drink at the bar.  Got sat in the corner 3-top and thus began a very enjoyable dining experience.  We each had a drink, which we all enjoyed.\n\nWe started with the two artichoke dishes.  The first was the \"Jewish Artichoke\" (still haven't figured the naming out on that one), which is a small artichoke that turned into a blossom by repeatedly dipping it into searing oil oil.  I think they topped it off with a little sea salt and we could add fresh lemon.  Wow, it was truly amazing.  The second was the artichoke carpacio, which was thinly shaved and served with some similarly thinly shaved cheese and greens.  All three of us loved it.\n\nAfter finishing the drinks, the sommelier suggested a nice, inexpensive ($38) bottle of Italian white wine (can't recall the name).  This was after giving us a taste of a white we had picked up by the glass but didn't like.  He asked us what we liked and thought we might enjoy and then made his suggestion.  Good call on his part.\n\nI had the carbonara and thought it was excellent: light yet flavorful, with thing strips of bacon about an inch long.  My dining companions (Art and Gary) both had the veal-stuffed pasta triangles.  Yum, yum, yum.  The sauce seemed to be a light butter and parmesan type sauce.  We all splits to vegetable sides: snow peas and carrots, which were panned seared with some herbs, salt and pepper, and served al dente.  Quite good.\n\nWe finished with the warm chocolate cake, which was out of this world.  \n\nService was excellent.  Atmosphere was inviting and decor beautiful.  It was a bit loud when we sat down but as soon as I asked our server to turn down the speaker that was directly overhead and pointed at our table, he turned it down and it was fine.", "author": "Kevin M."}

Was excellent. A deep fried one battered crispy thing of goodness.\n\nFRIED MURDOCK'S DUCK EGG - guanciale, dandelion ($11) is their tribute to the soft cooked egg. This egg had a nice soft runny center.\n\nPIZZA BIANCA- w/ Fra Mani Mortadella ($7)  focaccia-like Roman-style flatbread and not really a pizza as most people know what, had some very crunchy bread along with high-quality mortadella. This is more of a mini sandwich.\nFrankly they give you this type of flat bread for free, so you really don't need to order this dish.\n\nDeep fried lamb brains and artichokes ($12) was more deep fried goodness. We worried about getting mad cow disease, but what the heck. The brains taste just like sweetbreads.\n\nRadiatore \"Pecora E Pecorino\" lamb ragu, pecorino, mint  ($17) was a very good circular pasta with balanced flavors. The mint was not overpowering thankfully.\n\nGUINEA HEN LEG al SPIEDO ($21) was roasted on the rotisserie and very tender. Portion size was on the small side though.\n\nBAVETTE STEAK - radicchio trevisano ($25) was cooked to our desired level of doneness and a tender tasty, well portioned piece of meat.\n\nLamb Scottaditto anchovy & coriander ($26) were 2 excellent lamb chops, but way too tiny! We could have used to more at this price. The waiter did a good job explaining how the name came from burnt fingers.\n\nSnap peas ($8) with mint, spring onion was fresh, crisp, and delectable.\n\nErbette ($8) chard with garum, pine nuts was overly lemony, but that was okay with us. They need to tone this down.\n\nOK: (Order if you like this dish)\nMojito ($10) was excellent and well balanced, but filled with so much crushed ice that we should have sent it back!\n\nTONNARELLI CACIO e PEPE - pecorino, black pepper, basta ($14) was a peppery pasta which was just too cheesy.\n\nBucatini All'amatriciana guanciale, tomato, pepperoncini, pecorino ($17) was okay, also pretty peppery, with a sour tomato sauce that tilted the dishes' balance.", "author": "Ellen H."}

I was shocked to see it was literally next door to Bar Tartine and I asked the GM who told me the two restaurants have a totally friendly relationship. Nice to hear :) \n\nWe we're looking to drink so we stuck with water which was just fine. We decided to split the Lamb's Tongue appetizer even though I usually dislike tongue I knew my boyfriend wanted to try it. Best Tongue I ever had!I had heard about the Halibut collar but they were out of the special . I was so disappointed it took me a while to choose my entree since I was already set on having fish. I ordered the pasta with squash blossoms and ricotta, and my boyfriend had a fettucini with rabbit sugo. Both pastas with delicious, light, and flavorful. Mine was lemony without being acidic. I was impressed. \n\nTo our benefit, the back of house was confused and sent out my pasta as an appetizer. We sent it back and they were so apologetic and nice about the mixup. They sent us two drinks that were like an italian soda meets a mojito as well as a side of snap peas that were fresh and tasty but too buttery for me.

I wonder if the restaurant knows the definition of reservation???  \n\nThe service was ok but food was extremely mediocre.  The cauliflower pizza was good but the short ribs were are huge miss.  It was dry and salty, completely unappetizing.  Even though the appetizers were disappointing, I was hoping the entrees would redeem the place somehow but that didn't happened.  I had the LAMB SCOTTADITO and if you want your meat to have the texture of chewing gum, then this is the right dish to order.  I'm sure everyone has had their share of low quality meat where the more you chew the harder the meat gets.  My friends had pasta:  CUSCINI - ravioli w/ burrata & shrimp which was decent but have you breath freshener ready, you'll need it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-02", "description": "My wife and I had an early dinner last Wednesday at the new hotspot, Locanda on Valencia in the Mission.  Got there when it opened (5:30 pm) and could sense the recent buzz from the sight of anxious diners outside cozying up next to the recent addition of valet parking service (street parking really easy at that time during the week, though).  \n\nWe were immediately seated at a two-top next to another two-top already in progress.  My only complaint about the entire experience that evening was this initial seating arrangement.  My wife and I have no problem showing up at a restaurant w/o reservations hoping for any seats available, but we made reservations and it was borderline hilarious how close the two small tables were from each other.  Literally there was about a two-inch separation.  To me, this is far more awkward than sitting at a communal table knowing that side-to-side banter is occasionally expected/welcomed.  It was more confusing when noticing that this arrangement didn't seem all that necessary considering the layout of the front room.  There seemed to be more than enough space to actually make these two-tops separate dining adventures.\n\nRestaurants have a tendency to employ this table technique when space is limited or poorly-laid out.  This is not the case at Locanda.  The interior is beautiful, with a spacious and gorgeous bar that slightly juts out the further you venture back, giving way to the open kitchen and constellation-like chandeliers that adorn the back dining area.  You can tell that a considerable amount of thought was put into the design and layout, and the results are impressive, even the setup of the two bathrooms divided by a shared, sleek wash area.  \n\nMy wife and I quickly changed seats and moved to the bar (which remained accessible at the beginning of service) to have our meal.  Our bartender was very welcoming and willing to dispense his thorough knowledge of the menu and how ingredients were sourced, all with a thick English accent.  I ordered the Smoke and Spice, a delicious blend of gin, antica carpano, and scotch.  Tried to recreate it at home without as much luck.  Maybe it had something to do with the enormous ice cube that made Locanda's version so much better.  Probably not, but the ice is a nice touch, nonetheless.\n\nStarted with carciofi crudi, which was a medley of grilled ricotta, thin slices of avocado and artichoke, and arugula.  This was a pleasing combination and the greens were nicely dressed.  The \"grill\" aspect of the ricotta was lost on me but didn't affect the overall success of the dish.  We also ordered warm lamb's tongue, which was my favorite.  The lamb was delicately sliced and strewn across braised turnips and mystery greens.  I love going to restaurants and trying ingredients that I don't have often, never had before or never liked very much before being introduced to a delicious way of preparation.  The tongue was divine and the turnips...wow...I've never liked them before but here, they were soft, warm, and melted in your mouth.\n\nFinished with the VEAL CASONCELLI alla SALTIMBOCCA, guinea hen leg with pancetta and blue lake beans with anchovies.  The veal pasta was rich yet absolutely fantastic.  I don't go for veal but this is definitely worth an exception.  The guniea hen was moist and savory and accompanied by lentils and dandelion greens that were a bit bitter, but, then again, I've never had less-bitter dandelion greens.  Beans with anchovies were a hit, as the anchovies were pureed into a coating for the fresh green beans and instantly made me want to recreate the dish at home.\n\nGood Pinot Noir on tap (could have been slightly cooler), attentive service, lively atmosphere (place got crowded quick), artful interior and inventive food.  $130 for two with four drinks (including tip).  Not a place I can afford everyday, but we'll definitely be back as soon as we can.  Nice job.", "author": "Jason H."}

He was oh so very correct. We started out with Jewish Style Artichoke and the Dungeness Crab and Sorrel Soup with chili and croutons. While I was waiting I had a fresh ginger-ale.

You could really taste the chilies and the crab was so yummy. We practically licked the bowls clean. \nMy boyfriend ordered the linguini with clams and I ordered the mixed grill. His linguini was good, but we both thought it lacked body. We wanted more of a sauce or something with it. He said it was really light and refreshing though. \nMy mixed grill consisted of quail, spareribs, lamb loin chops, and sweetbread, with asparagus. It was absolutely delicious.

We ordered the Pizza Bianca with bone marrow, which our server was quick to let us know wasn't you're average slice of pie. \nIt was perfectly seasoned flat bread along side a couple pieces of roasted bones, split in half with a very nice radish and parsley salad. A great first bite. The Tripe,  braised and as tender as can be was served in a red sauce (reminiscent of most people's grandma's cooking). A perfect vehicle with the never- ending bread that showed up at our table. Raw Artichoke Salad with peppery baby arugula, and smoked Ricotta Salata. The rich avocado was the perfect compliment to the arugula and crispy raw artichoke slices. The dressing was faint, i believe just a nice extra virgin olive oil and a touch of white wine vinegar. It definitely let the ingredients shine. \nRich Oxtails were braised in red wine and then glazed with the reduced liquid. It was all i could do not to suck on the bones to get every last bit of meat off. The Rabbit Saddle was boneless and wrapped in it's own belly (rabbit bacon). It had a cured meat flavor, but was really good as was the  polenta gnocchi served alongside. The pasta(Bucantini) was perfectly cooked and the sauce with the cured pork cheeks and more tomato was exactly what  Amatriciana is all about. Ricotta Fritters were really nice with the honey, but my favorite dessert was the red wine granita with black  pepper panna. Tart granita layered with lightly whipped cream and a couple of sugar cookies was the perfect light dessert to aid in digestion. \n The service might be slow for some. We sat Down at 6:15, had 3 first courses one after the other, and then all the entrees came out at once. By the time the dessert came out and our check was paid, it was about 8 pm.

I know that this is not a Danny Meyer restaurant but I was shocked how the front of the house was such a clusterf*ck considering Anne Stoll (and her corresponding reputation) is running the program.    \n\nWe had reservations at 9:00 pm.  We were not seated until 9:40 pm.  While we were waiting for our table, we were offered complimentary house make pork jerky (1 string each).  I didn't eat mine, my gf thought it was too spicy.  Around 9:20, I asked the gf if she wanted try chef Balla's food at Bar Tartine next door?  She wanted to stay, so we stayed.  We were told and shown (!?!?!?!) which table was \"enjoying their wine too long\" and \"holding things up.\" (the host's words not mine)  First, you should never rush another table; second, you should NEVER identify the table in question to the next party in line; third, my reservation should not be tied to a single two top (i.e., seat me at the next open table).  Pro-tip: stop stacking reservations if you don't have the seats to sit everyone.  What is the point of making a reservation if I have to wait the same length of time as if I had simply walked in for a table.  \n\nMoreover, the two two-tops near the bathroom (high chairs) were given away to other guests while we were waiting (both sets of guests arrived after we did).  I'm not sure if those tops were reserved for walk-ins or not, but I should have been offered those seats.  I was not.\n\nAt around 9:30, the only male at the front of the house promised me that \"food would be on the table\" when we were seated.  I suspected that it was an empty promise (unless this guy was cooking my food and serving it to us personally, which he was clearly not doing either, there was no way he was going to fulfill such a gambit).  To no one's surprise, no food was present when we were finally seated at 9:40.  The front of the house should never make promises it cannot keep to the customer.  The terrible customer service did not end there.\n\n10 minutes after being seat, our server had not made an appearance.  I had to get up from my seat, walk back to the host stand, and ask them to send our waiter over because we were starving at that point. \n\nThese were the more egregious errors of the night.  Pacing between course was also really really slow.            \n\nBut you know what, all of the above would have been forgotten (or largely mitigated) as ancillary atmospherics had the food been spectacular.  The food was not spectacular.  It was just ok.  The tripe and hen leg were good, both pastas (carbonara and spring blossom) were average to below average.  The portions were small (the hen leg was just that).  \n\nOp-ed time: your money can be better spent at the following restaurants serving similar style food at similar price points: Flour+Water; Cotogna; and SPQR.", "author": "Charlie C."}

After hearing her talk about how much she liked the food and the place my boyfriend decided he had to go here last Friday. So I called Locanda for a reservation. Obviously without much planning and because it's one of the hot new restaurants in the area the hostess told me that the next available seating was at 11pm. Well that did not deter us from going there. We declined the reservation and decided to just try our luck and head over as a \"walk in'. After arriving at 8:30pm last Friday we were seated in 20 minutes at the communal table. This is actually a fun place to sit other than at the bar. We made friends at our table for 10. It's also a great place to see what other folks ordered that you didn't. Also, the communal table you can hear an honest and candid review. The menu had so many things we wanted to try but only two of us, my boyfriend and I ordered the following:\n\nJewish Style Artichoke. A must. It's grilled not steamed. Something different from what you're use to. \n\nOxtails alla Vaccinara. It was cooked right as the meat fell off the bone. The dish was tasty and surprisingly contained tiny bits of cocoa nibs. The sauce it's cooked in reminds me of Mole.\n\nFettuccine rabbit sugo, cicoria, verjus. A recommendation from our girlfriend and glad we listened and ordered it. It was made with a lite white cream sauce. The dish was simple even though it doesn't sound simple.  This was delicious. \n\nGrilled Halibut Collar. It was cooked in garlic and included sauteed pea shoots. This was our least favorite dish because the fish was a little fishy. \n\nFor dessert we shared the chocolate cake which was just okay.  \n\nLocanda also has a full bar and offers a variety of their signature cocktails that my boyfriend enjoyed.\n\nDefinitely coming back again and since they offer Valet service this makes it easier to come back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-06-12", "description": "The quick version: the food was good, though overpriced in my opinion for what it is, but what makes me in no rush to go back is that the service was awful. \n\nWe had the Jerusalem artichokes, the tripe, and the duck egg to start. We then had the bucatini all'amatriciana and the linguini with anchovies and padron peppers. We finished with the lamb chops. Overall, it was delicious. The bucatini and the lamb chops were our favorites. Least favorite was the linguini, as the padron peppers overwhelmed the anchovies.  The lamb was great, but 26 bucks for two lamb chops is high. \n\nBut the service is what really was disappointing.  Especially since this is an offshoot of Delfina, which, despite some slipping the last couple of years, was always made more special by its amazing staff. \n\nOur waitress did a number of things wrong.  First, she didn't know the wine list well, but instead of just admitting that, she struggled through giving us pretty unclear answers. Next, our pasta course was brought after we ordered the wine but before the wine was delivered -- the wine is to drink with the food and they totally screwed that up.  \n\nWorst, the food was not brought in the right order.  We had asked for our apps, then our pasta, and finally our lamb.  Instead they brought the lamb with the pasta, which frankly is just dumb if you hold yourself out as an Italian/Roman restaurant.  What really annoyed me is that when we asked them to remove the lamb and keep it warm for us, the server who brought it agreed, but then our waitress came by to say \"I thought you wanted the lamb with the pasta\".  What is the point of her coming by to ask that?  We had already asked them to remedy it and her coming by accomplished nothing.  It was an amateur move.  \n\nI'm not willing to pay these prices for good food with bad service.  I might try them again down the road if I hear service is fixed, but until then, Range continues to displace Delfina & Co as the best experience in the Mission.", "author": "Ross D."}

Although the place was packed and buzzing, the gracious hostess, Dianne, found us a table in the quieter rear section.  The attentive, professional, and unpretentious staff helped us select a bottle of Italian Pinot Noir Rose to complement our varied meal selection. First came the Spring Onions appetizer: fried perfectly, well seasoned and crunchy in a tempura batter, with wispy strands of cheese on top.  We almost ordered a second, just as our Radiatore pasta dish arrived.  The unusual, barrel shaped pasta had tasty bits of lamb in a lovely tomato ragu sauce, highlighted by pecorino cheese. A perfectly executed bavette (flank) steak followed; cooked medium rare and set atop a melange of radicchio and smoky mashed potatoes (of which there could have been a bit more!). Dessert was a delicious crostada with bits of candied fruit topped with a dollop of creamy goat cheese.\n\nOur first visit was magical and we'll be back again!", "author": "Tom B."}

I was not expecting much, given a couple of my friends' mediocre reviews, but apparently the dining gods were smiling on us.\n\nWe had the jewish-style artichoke to start, which was greasy fried delicious deliciousness, and my boyfriend had a piece of their house-made pork jerky, which he said was awesome.  For the main course, I had the chestnut agnolotti, and it was AMAZING.  I'm drooling just thinking about it.  House-made pasta stuffed with chestnut cream, topped with brown butter with sage and I think a bit of pepper.  SO GOOD.  I could eat that stuff by the gallon.  My boyfriend had the grilled lamb leg with anchovy butter.  He's pretty fussy and gave the (very good-natured) waiter super-specific instructions about how he wanted the meat done.  It came out precisely as he'd asked for, and he loved it.\n\nThe low point was dessert (odd, for me).  We got the warm chocolate cake to share.  It was fine, but nothing special.  The cake itself was not what I was expecting -- slightly dry, and not particularly sweet.  Combined with the garnishes (maple syrup, cream, and walnuts) it tasted good, but on its own I actually didn't like it very much.  After the sweet delicious amazingness of the chestnut pasta, I was a little disappointed.\n\nSpecial shout-out for the service -- our waiter was so ridiculously nice I noted his name to include in this review:  it was Jason.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-07", "description": "There was a time when friends and family in other parts of the country asked what I was talking about whenever I mentioned eating an artichoke.  Today this wonderful thistle is grown almost everywhere the sun and water can be found, and they're cultivated year round.  When I see these beauties on a menu anywhere, I take note and face a tough choice whether to go for one or eat the fare the restaurant is known for.  My partner and I frequently dine at Chow here in the City, Duarte's in Pescadero and Little Napoli in Carmel because each treats the 'choke' with respect and a touch of reverence.  When we yelped Locanda, we saw dozens of five star reviews and even more mentions of their artichoke presentation so it became a mission and we were soon at this truly wonderful 'Roman' restaurant enjoying our coveted treasure and the other handcrafted and delicious offerings with great relish.  So, our friend Bobby called and suggested we catch an early dinner on a Monday night and we made reservations here and made our first foray into Locanda to see ourselves what all the chatter is really about.  It's on uber cool Valencia and next door to what was recently Bar Tartine, but like most chic joints in the Mission it's a rectangular storefront with windows open to the street and a designer interior which is really comfortable as well as suave and debonair.  We were seated in the back with a corner that suited us perfectly and we were able to talk like a family without busybodies eavesdropping on our dirty little secrets.  \n\nI'd checked the menu on Yelp, then read many of the 200 plus reviews to get a feel for what people were raving or ranting about to guide our initial visit, but I knew the Artichoke and Sweetbreads were going to arrive at our table before we left.  They have a full bar with a terrific cocktail menu, good wine list and unfortunately no kind of diet beverage.  Starbelly refused to carry diet soda but the complaints were loud and furious and they relented and now serve an organic diet cola and everyone is happy.  I tend to be resentful when a restaurant owner decides for me what I can and can't drink and I remember when a great local restaurateur opened a French place on Van Ness and refused to allow salt or pepper to be served by the wait staff because the French Chef said his food was perfectly seasoned and adding anything would be an insult to him.  They didn't last long.  So we ordered the 'Jewish style artichoke' and a plate of Sweetbreads to start.  Both were mouth watering and solid hits.  The hosts were well trained, courteous and attentive and followed up on their work, a nice touch.  The servers and floor manger all took pride in their jobs and worked hard to provide five star service.  When it came to the next courses, we got lost and probably should have asked for more guidance from the staff because we weren't happy with the heavily peppered Carbonara w/ Guanciale which was tossed generously with a strong mustard type sauce although the Penne itself was almost perfect.  We also shared the poached Salmon which was excellent but perhaps under accompanied with complementary tastes.  The peas were rock hard and the Mussels were almost mushy.  We split the ricotta fritte for dessert and this was a homerun all the way around the table.\n\nThis is an ambitious, serious, accomplished restaurant created by smart and successful restaurant pro's and is already an out of the ball park homerun, so I owe it to myself and my guests to go back at least several times to taste and try their unique menu offerings in a stylish setting with superior service.", "author": "Stu S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-29", "description": "I'd been looking forward to Locanda for weeks as I've been a fan of Delfina (and Delfina Pizzeria) for years. This weekend we had out-of-town guests with us and needed to take them to a place we could all get excited about. Locanda only had 10:30PM available on Saturday which I took, though I included a note on the on line reservation asking for earlier if it became available. Within a day, Locanda's host called to say a 9PM opened up - did we want it? So we go in earlier and I have to say the fact they read my note and acted upon it was impressive. Upon arriving we were greeted with warmth and enthusiasm. Seated immediately, spied house-made gianciale curing along with what looked like strips of jerky in a display case. After ordering a bottle of light Italian red wine, I asked the sommelier what the jerky was. Thought I can't recall the name, it was strips of pork loin cured for weeks in spices and herbs and eaten as a bar snack.\n\n We ordered that to much on while we perused the menu. I ordered the pig ear terrine, asparagus with a poached duck egg, and leg of guinea fowl. Others in our party ordered the pasta with rabbit sugo, sweetbreads with artichokes, anchovy pasta, and a contorni side dish of carrots stewed with green grapes. The asparagus, terrine, rabbit sumo and guinea fowl were hits we all agreed, one friend however disliked his anchovy pasta dish as being too spicy. It WAS spicy alright, but I have to say as a roman, rustic, rich pasta it was spot on for me. Just not for those with plainer tastes. The sweetbreads were delish and the poached duck egg's molten yolk ran all over the asparagus to combine with the brown butter included on the plate to create a velvety, very sumptuous dish. The big miss for everyone at the table was the cured strips of pork loin. I thought they were a bit under seasoned and less than optimal for sharing. Others at the table were just baffled by them. Service was top notch: friendly, interested, engaged, yet unobtrusive. \n\nI have address some of the really bitchy commentary on here about comments like 'whatever Delfina puts in the compost gets run over to Locanda', and 'pig's ears are for dogs' make me think the writer has a palate better suited for Fridays or perhaps Marie Callenders. The pig's ear terrine was rich, creamy, and flavorful. Everything one would expect to experience in an Italian salumeria or french charcuterie. I hope readers on here will try it. Offal, one of the glories of almost every culture in the world except America (see Maria Callenders), is delicious here: the sweetbreads delicately fried and carefully served with artichokes, the beef tendon, melt in your mouth. One of our party ordered the salad misticanza and it was a lovely melange of the best heirloom and micro greens, a few coins of radish and a light vinaigrette.\n\n I've heard places like Denny's & Fast food joints do salad bars with Iceberg lettuce and 2000 calorie dressings. Perhaps the reader who thought the greens were from the roadway would enjoy that experience more?", "author": "Jordan N."}

We ordered an appetizer which came with their bread, we could have easily filled ourselves up with breads but we controlled ourselves. When we sat down they told us about the specials which was Halibut, my friend ordered it and I ordered another fish on the menu. We both finished every single piece and ordered desert even though we were pretty full, I tell ya I am so happy we did. The chocolate cake was so good, we finished that too.

He did not even ask if we were ready to order (we were) and disappeared for another 15 minutes.  I finally flagged him down again to take our order, which he finally did.  At 9:15, more than an hour after arriving, we finally got our salads.  We had to wait another 30 minutes to get our entrees.  He had screwed up one of our orders and we again waited for that to be corrected.  When he finally cleared our plates and brought us dessert menus at 10:30pm, we had had it.

While better, it was barely above the threshold of drinkability.\n2) Where's the bread?  There is a bunch of beautiful looking focaccia stacked high near the kitchen but it was never delivered to a single table.  We had to ask and got 4 measly slices after being in the restaurant for about 30 minutes.  OK, I get if you are trying to cut costs, but don't leave it out in plain sight.  And put a disclaimer on the menu that you need to ask for it.\n3) Pizza, this is not pizza.  They call it pizza and it taste good, but it is three slices of bruschetta.  At least call it what it is.\n4) The pasta is appetizer size.  When pasta cost in the high teens, it should be enough to fill you up.  These small plates qualify as an appetizer.  Come on, how much does it cost to put another 10-15 noodles in the water?  Pennies\n5) And last but not least, where is the parmeggiano?  We had to ask for parmeggiano for the pasta and they brought it out in a tiny bowl.   I'm Italian and have eaten at a lot of Italian restaurants in San Francisco as well as Italy and I cannot remember a single time when parmeggiano was not either on the table or the waiter brings in by and hand grates it.

First of all I'd like to take partial blame for just doing a walk in. I know it's more convenient to make a reservation but, by principle, I couldn't use their online service. The hostess offered up 3 seats at the communal table but they were all side to side making it hard to talk and it was right by the front door. No one likes a cold draft blowing on them while they eat right? So I ask how long a table would be. 20 minutes she says. There's a table just ordering dessert and they should be done soon.  Okay given the choice, I'd wait 20 minutes for a table.  \nHere's where it gets bad. The hostess comes by a couple times with updates. The first time is after 35 minutes of waiting. She indicates the table has finished dessert and paid. They're just waiting for them to leave. Okay what happened to telling me 15 minutes ago at the 20 minute mark? The second time is at the 45 minute mark. She says she's still waiting for the table to leave and it'll be any moment. Usually I'm fine with this but I ask if the table she's waiting to clear is the one I'm pointing at. She's like yeah. So I know this table is not going to leave because the waiter just convinced them to buy a bottle of wine and they all have full glasses. They're going to be there at least another half hour. So the hostess sends the other hostess in to say oh we didn't know they're still drinking. Really? You can't look at the table and tell they're not leaving yet? Ridiculous! She then proceeds to offer three seats at the bar where more people haven't left yet. She goes you can sit at which ever leaves first.  \nSo here are my problems;\n1. The lack of timely communication about the status of a table. If you had come to me at the 20 minute mark and said they're not leaving, I would have left and found another restaurant. Don't keep me milling around for another 25 minutes just so you can make money off me. \n2. Okay so our table wasn't leaving, why couldn't they offer us another table?\n3. You offer us bar seats that aren't even available yet. Who knows how long they're going to be. I could be waiting another 45 minutes. Just say we don't have seating and let me go on my way. \n4. You would think they would have offered an appetizer or something for waiting so long. Nothing.", "author": "Victor L."}

The carbonara was not prepared properly, not eggy enough, lacking flavor, eggs cooked too long, the rabbit sauce on the other pasta dish  was also underwhelming, lacking depth, but OK; the best part of the evening was the waiter, a guy from Piedmonte, who suggested a fabulous wine from the region, and who provided perfect service.

First, a little personal history:  I returned from Italy in late June, finishing up my trip in Rome.  I have been there before and I looked forward to some spectacular meals, but, alas due to some conditions beyond my control, myself and my friends ran out of money and could not eat the kind of food I so had looked forward to in Rome. \n  Locanda was my Rome.  From the moment I made the reservations I read everything I could about the owners, the chef, the menu and I waited for my long deserved perfectly made Negroni, Jewish Artichokes and pasta Carbonara.  I was not disappointed.  This place rocked.  I went with a party of 10 and more wanted to go but we could not get a larger table.  The server, Ethan, (you are the best)  was full of helpful tips and had a wonderful personalty.  We wanted for nothing, Everything ran smoothly.\n  I applauded every course from the coctails, to the perfect bread with the salty crusty top, to the little crostini with the salmon eggs that melted in my mouth.  The Jewish Artichokes were perfect and the portion was generous.  I had the halibut collar  which was crusty on the outside and moist and fresh on the inside.  The homemade pasta Carbonara was as good as any I have had in Rome.  We also had a fresh corn and cheese contori which was great.  \n  We opted for a couple of bottles of red wine and picked from the cheap seat price and it was very good.  \n  We finished with the chocolate cake which was so heavenly we had to order a second serving with a glass of port to wash it down.  I know it is a lot of food, but this food is so good I can eat salad every day for a week after to loose the extra calories.  It is so worth it.  Bravo Locanda.\nI have already made two more reservations here and I am usually the type of person who moves from restaurant to restaurant, but with Locanda I feel like this is as good as it gets.", "author": "linda g."}

Actually thought the broccoli side was the best thing we got.  Good atmosphere but seemed a bit too slick for a delfina owned place", "author": "Brent C."}

So when I heard Locanda opened, I gave it a few months of opening jitters before trying it.  And am I ever glad I did.  The food ranks high.  Innovative; tasty; perfect portions.  The pizza biana with figs and proscuitto - enough said.  If I didn't have to share it, I would have eaten the whole thing myself.  I had the grilled halibut collar...tender, juicy, flavourful morsels.  My hubby had the pasta carbonara of which he said was amazing, and he's a carbonara snob.  our friend had the rabbit which from the one bite i had, solid.  we shared the fried ricotta with lemon reduction.  if only they hadn't run out of lemoncello...if only.  my only complaint - the timing was off between the appetizers and the main.  we waited over 1/2 hour for our mains to show...the manager came over to apologize, which made me feel a little better.  Definitely set for a return here.", "author": "Sonia C."}

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars, is because I've only been once, and it was 10:30 at night, and I didn't want to eat too much.  Decor is enviably chic, and very appropos.  I'd go back in a heartbeat.", "author": "Joe C."}

We had an amazing experience Friday night. We sat at the bar and the service was terrific. We enjoyed a couple of well crafted cocktails. The Amaro Tropicale and the Suspiria were awesome drinks and the guys behind the bar paid close attention to all the details, providing us with sublime drinks! Well done! Now for the food. Crispy lamb brains, cauliflower pizza and fried artichoke to start. All were good, especially the brains. They resembled sweet breads, but their texture was creamier and richer. We then enjoyed pasta amatricana with freshly made bucatini. Afterwards the braised oxtails with a side of roasted squash. This was the highlight for sure. The oxtails were amazing. So much so, I had to pick them up and gnaw on them to get all the tasty bits. I'm glad we came back and I am looking forward to the next dinner.", "author": "c.t. d."}

Cocktails. appetizers, pasta, entree and dessert. I enjoyed it so much they should pay me!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-06", "description": "We came here with pretty great expectations as we love delfina and pizzeria delfina. The cocktails were great and really reminded me of Italy. The food was pretty good. The bread/pizza bianco was delicious. Highly recommend the artichoke and the bucatini. The erbette contorni had too much orange and was inedible to me. It was my date's birthday, and I made this a point when I made the reservation, when I confirmed our reservation, and when we walked in, and yet he received no special recognition. Another table got a candle in their dessert and I wondered why we didn't? I guess I'm disappointed because I expected the food and service to be better. I imagine we'll go back for a cocktail and a snack at the bar, but I don't imagine going again for a special occasion.", "author": "Addie J."}

The wine and the appetizers were excellent, the ox tail I had was very tasty, however it was a little too fatty for me.   The server was very helpful in helping me get other dishes.  I had oxtails before and I don't remember it being as fatty as what I had last night, I think I just had not such a great piece, I'm glad I tried it though.  I really loved the Jewish style artichoke and the salad we had.  The restaurant itself is beautiful and I am enamored with the wood burning grill in the kitchen.", "author": "Mark G."}

Waitress friendly and funny, but knows her stuff. Cocktails, waitress-recommended wines and food (intensely flavorful Jewish-style artichoke, smokey grilled steak, thick, chewy spaghetti with fava beans and leaves, snap peas with mint and chocolate cake) all excellent. Very reasonable tab.", "author": "David H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-08-23", "description": "Wow.  What a disappointment.  I am shocked at reading all of the other positive reviews from other diners.  I ate here two weeks ago with 3 others.  The service was beyond slow.  We had to flag our waiter down to order cocktails. Then again to order our meal.  I think we sat there for about an hour before ordering... and this was at 9:45pm.  The appetizers took far too long to get to us and they forgot two of them.  Then our appetizer plates sat there so long, I got up to tell the absent waiter (and we also wanted to order another bottle of wine).  He nodded and then proceeded to do nothing.  Our entree plates came and the runners simply pushed aside our appetizer plates with the edges of these plates.  Unbelievable.  The food was mediocre, oversalted and the portions were way too small for what they charge.  Around $28 for my two lamb chops.  After I gave everyone at the table a bite, I had about five bites left for myself.  Ridiculous.  All of my friends had a similar experience, with my entree being the best (and it really was't that great to begin with).  There are too many wonderful restaurants in this City.  It's been a while since I have had such poor service (with the Mission hipster attitude to boot) and lackluster food.  I couldn't take it anymore, so I approached the hostess and asked to speak with the manager.  I will say, he was very, very apologetic and listened to everything I had to say. Unfortunately, it was a little late to make up for the crappy experience.  Maybe I'll give it another try 100 years from now.  I think it will take them that long to get it right.", "author": "Heather H."}
