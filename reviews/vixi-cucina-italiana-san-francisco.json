Their bread is so soft and comes with butter and a tomato dip. We ordered the cavolini (brussel sprouts), capellini pomodoro, and tortellini alla panna between three people. Their large portion sizes made it the perfect amount of food for us. The capellini was delicious and had just the right amount of sauce and salt to keep it light and flavorful. The tortellini alla panna was my favorite - perfectly al dente and creamy. The cavolini was alright, but a little overcooked for my taste.\n\nThe restaurant is small and cozy, and the staff is friendly and hospitable. Our waiter helped us pick a great pinot noir, and gave me a very generous pour for the tasting when he heard it was my birthday.", "author": "Apoorva A."}

At an off hour, with a messy and restless toddler, they were gracious and patient and didn't really bat an eye. For that alone I am grateful.\n\nAs for the food, the noodles weren't as great as you might have thought from a place that specializes in pasta, but the red sauce on my son's dish was a cut above. Judging from the smell of garlic wafting through the place, I'd stick to something with that red sauce on it next time.", "author": "William B."}

I so fondly remember the delicious food in Rome and in several cities in Sicilia. \n\nThat said we both wanted Italian food. And it is hard to find a place where I can eat much - I'm vegetarian and try to avoid dairy and white flour/grains, sugar. So goodbye pasta, gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, pumpkin ravioli with brown butter, etc., etc.\n\nSo, we gave the restaurant a shot. I was resigned to thinking I'd just have some salad and a side vegetable. But, they had a WHOLE WHEAT pasta primavera. It was great. The pasta actually tasted good and the marinara was excellent. The vegetables were well cooked and plentiful- just the way I make it myself. Full of mushrooms, eggplant, broccolini, kale and zucchini. My wife loved her chicken Marsala with a side of farro. She said the sauce was great and it wasn't too salty. \n\nThe started is off with complimentary focaccia with a tomato dip. I just tasted a tiny bit and both were wonderful. We got a side of Caesar and that was fantastic. So was the side of Brussels Sprouts \n\nAll in all a great dining experience. \n\nStill like this place a lot BUT they should remove pizza from the menu. Got the margherita at iscwas a sog fest. Water from the sauce or something dropped off of it. The crust had absolutely no crispness to it at all. The cheese was plentiful but didn't taste great. When the waiter checked in I told him I was disappointed in the pizza and he said there was something wrong with the oven. So they know they are turning out lousy pizza and they are still serving it and charging for it. Boooooo. Removing a star.", "author": "Marco M."}

The broccolini was good but there were too many stems for my liking. \n\nWe also got the tortellini soup and side Caesar salad. The soups broth was tasty. It had a few chunks of beef and a large hard to eat out of the cup leaf of kale. The tortellini itself was my least favorite part of the dish.  She Caesar salad was average but the dressing was not my favorite. \n\nWe also ordered the build your own kids pasta which came with a drink. We got spaghetti with Alfredo sauce.

Their carb concoctions seem like something your mother could have whipped up in the kitchen. Fresh, hot (temperature), and generous in portions. I think most importantly is the hospitality of the staff there. We had a doting server, but in all the best ways.\n\nCan you eat too much carbohydrates? No, you can't. So you gobble up the complimentary bread that's served with this aromatic, savory tamponade. The bread is focaccia-like (perhaps it's focaccia), and should it come straight out of the oven, is warm and fluffy.\n\nThe main event was the bolognese for me, which was the rigatoni pasta, al dente as it should be no other way, in a ground pork and beef tomato sauce with (visible) crimini mushroom. The flavor was bold and kept the palette excited.\n\nThe entire dinner party covered most of their pasta menu as well as the salmon, and there were smiles all around.", "author": "Cici T."}

The last time I was there, my dad and I ordered the Bolognese ($15), Fettucini fungi ($15), and the side order of the Caesar salad ($5). The portions were huge compared to when I made a to go order of the Bolognese. It was delicious, but not amazing. The meal also came with a pre-appetizer of focaccia with a tomato dip (1 piece per person) and it's actually really good. To me, it's more memorable than the pasta.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-04", "description": "I've been here twice, and it's really been a great experience both times. I think this is probably one of the best options for food in the area, but I do love me some pasta.\n\nBoth times, I've come around lunchtime on the weekdays, and it never actually seems to be packed. It actually seems to be fairly empty, save for some people who are super-retired, probably because it's a sitdown place and people are always in a rush to get back to work. But really, it's not that slow.\n\nWhen you come into the restaurant, you're greeted by an open kitchen on your right, and they always seem to have pasta laid out on baking pans which is pretty cool. It's unique at least; someone's making pasta, and it gets me in the mood. To eat pasta. The restaurant itself is clean and not super loud which is nice, and the lighting is also on point.\n\nThe waiters are nice but not overbearing, and service is great. I think they hit that perfect sweet spot for caring about you without being annoying. You get bread before your meal with a sweet tomato sauce, which is pretty good, but it's definitely not your traditional marinara. It's probably closer to a sundried tomato jam than anything, but whatever it is, it's good. The bread is nice and soft on the inside with the slightest amount of toastiness on the outside. It's not the best bread ever, but they definitely put some effort into it, which is always much appreciated.\n\nThe two times I came here, I ordered the Penne Gamberi and the Fettuccini Funghi. I'd say both probably took about 10-15 minutes to come out.\n\nThe Fettuccini Funghi was $16 and probably my favorite of the two. It was a really good size, and came with chicken, mushrooms, Italian sausage, all in a super creamy decadent sauce. There almost aren't words to describe the luxuriousness of this dish, it is pretty much just jaw-droppingly rich. And as I am never on a diet, this was pretty much everything I could have asked for. But even with the super creaminess of this dish, the mushroom flavor is present throughout, which is great because I love mushrooms. 2 warnings about this one though: it is a really heavy meal, and the sausage is pretty salty. But overall, I think this is a must try (if you have the option of falling asleep immediately afterwards).\n \nThe Penne Gamberi was $17 and came with shrimp and broccolini in a creamy tomato sauce. There was nothing bad about this dish, but I don't know if I would order it again. The sauce had a nice mild seafood flavor about it, and the dish came with a very generous portion of shrimp, maybe like 7 or 8 large shrimps in total? There was one large piece of broccolini on top, and scattered cut up stems throughout the dish, which was a little disappointing. Because who actually likes the stems? It's all about the florets. Overall, I thought this dish was pretty vanilla: pleasant, but for the price I'd probably order something else.\n\nSo great service, great ambience, and good food. It is a little bit pricey, and there are a few things that could improve with the food, but even considering that, it's a great option. Especially with a group, I don't think anybody would walk away from here unhappy. I will definitely come back here in the future!", "author": "Eric Y."}

In an area that's full of sandwich shops, pizza parlors, and Asian restaurants, it was nice to spot Vixi on my trusty Yelp app. Parking was actually very easy to obtain, and just a short few steps from the restaurant. The inside is small, but cozy. I am a big fan of the kitchen being open, so you can watch the cooks prepare food. I think it's a nice touch that more restaurants should have. We sat in the back, and about a minute after being seated our bread with olive oil arrived. \n\nThe bread was tasty and hot, and the olive oil had a little tomato tapenade in it. The whole thing was quite good, and a great prelude for deliciousness to come. I ordered the Lemon Pepper Chicken, and for my one side I ordered broccolini. The chicken was fantastic. It was both cooked and seasoned perfectly. The broccolini was my favorite part of the meal. It had a very vibrant green hue, and it was mixed with big chunks of garlic, and tossed with pepper flakes. The whole meal just pops out at you. \n\nAs we waited for our meal, I witnessed the most bizarre and blasphemous thing to ever happen to Italian cuisine: An Italian woman and her children, asked for ketchup to slather their pasta and pizza with. I couldn't look away. I know I'm no chef, but in my mind, you use ketchup like you use steak sauce: to slather on something that was not cooked or seasoned right. It just seemed like an insult to the chef, and I was a little shocked. \n\nVixi feels like a fancy, Italian restaurant, without the overpriced menu items. They have beautiful local art on the walls, and the wait staff wear shirts with bowtie pasta as bowties, which is too cute.

I came for lunch on a Friday because I was drawn in by their lunch menu. $13 gets you one entree (pasta or panini)  with a side of your choice: minestrone soup, caesar salad, or mista salad. I opted for the Salmon pasta (forgot the actual name) and the mista salad. They also serve you bread, which is probably one the best I've had in the US, accompanied with a delicious sun-dried tomato sauce which I thought was a nice change from the typical olive oil and vinegar.\n\nThe salad was good and well sized. To be honest, I was pretty satisfied after the bread and salad... could've taken that pasta to-go if I really wanted (warning: I have a really small stomach, this salad+ bread alone will not fill the average person up). The pasta itself was a bit on the smaller side, but they did not skimp on the salmon which is a huge plus in my books. Also, I think it's awesome that they use whole wheat pasta! \n\nI will definitely be back, have my eye on the Caprese panini next time!", "author": "Brenda L."}

Another couple showed up with twins in a stroller, and it was no big deal. The staff made room for everyone and it wasn't tight in the back dining area. They have six high chairs available so I think it's a kid friendly place. We sat down and someone eventually took our order because she said our server was busy. We weren't offered the specials and had to ask about them. She was friendly and described the dishes and made everything sound good. She took our order and said we'd get bread. She brought our drinks and no bread. Then the actual server came by and again said she'd bring bread. No bread. At least not until after we ate up the Clams and Mussels and I decided to ask the busser for bread to soak up the remaining sauce. Our entrees took forever. One table next to us ordered when we ate our appetizer and left before we even ate half our entrees. And another table arrived after us, ate, and left before we did. My husband had the Chicken Sundried Tomato with Broccolini Pasta and I had the Chicken Cacciatore. Both were really good. I think they served up the best Minestrone I've had in a long time. The broth had good flavour and a nice amount of veggies but not too much. The bread was hot and tasty. The prices were great except for the $22 price tag for the Chicken Cacciatore. That seemed steep. But for $12, you can get a lunch pasta or panini with a side salad or soup. The service was really bad. It was friendly but not attentive nor consistent. Multiple tables had to ask for their check or a box and the place was NOT that busy. They had a lot of staff too, a host, a busser, and two servers for what looked like five or six tables of one to three people. Vixi is kid-friendly and parents approved! Good food, wine, and kids ok!

Just this past Monday we enjoyed another relaxing late lunch.  Service was typically friendly and efficient as always.\n\nAs for the food everything was as usual:  Fresh, plentiful, and tasty.  \n\nHonestly I am not sure why some reviewers dislike Vixi.  Prices?  There are very few SF Bay Area restaurants nowadays that offer lunch specials for less than $20 including either soup or salad (and a cup is actually more like a bowl at other restaurants).  Even a la carte menu items are less than $20 . Also the portions to prices are more than fair.  Food quality?  Of course,Vixi isn't offering Michelin-starred gourmet meals; that isn't the theme.  It's simple food at simple prices.  So if one is expecting 5* courses then one will be highly disappointed, and surely if one dislikes pasta why bother to dine in an Italian restaurant??\n\nTheir wine list is also very fair; we always enjoy a lovely bottle of pinot grigio from CA for $24.

Everything was delicious. \n\nWent to this place with a friend who's familiar in the area and the food was fresh, tasty, and priced very well. The Mista Salad, with gorgonzola and balsamic vinegar was something that was of new taste, since I don't like gorgonzola personally. But, having the balsamic vinegar taste, the salad was delicious and not over done with the cheese. My friend liked her beef soup and we do want to return and try the other dishes that kept passing around us to the other patrons. \n\nThe service was great, because everyone was kind from the moment you step in and out, and our server was very attentive to make sure we were either wanting for drinks or just had any questions about the menu. And the coffee? Love the little jars it comes in and the taste? Strong but delicious. \n\nDefinitely recommend it.", "author": "Audis V."}

We love it and get take out at least once every other week. Their food is really good! But their prices are reasonable!! Makes it perfect for takeout. No one likes to pay that SF fancy gourmet overpriced for take out so for this neighborhood it's great. Tons of families that would usually want to eat out but need to get kids in bed can just order takeout and get delicious food nearby. Love it!! Some favorites include their pizzas perfect size for two people to split w ordering another entree or salad/app. I like how size isn't huge and price is appropriate so you can still order 1-2 more things to have variety! My husband loves pizza wher I would prefer pasta and salad so we just order all 3 and have a great dinner. Please don't go! Happy pomodoro is gone and Vixi is here!", "author": "Katie D."}

As I walked in I noticed the restaurant had changed hands and it's now called VIXI, which translates to \"I have lived.\"\n\nI chose to sit at the bar because i like to see how the restaurant is run. The staff treat each other like family. That's because they basically are. They're all Pasta Pomodoro alumni and they will all rattle off when they joined the company, every location they worked at, and their favorite dishes over the years. \n\nIt turns out PP has left the City. The owner of VIXI was a long-time PP staffer who wanted to keep what they'd had going here so he asked if he could open VIXI where the last PP was closing. \n\nThe decor has been updated. They still need to fine tune the lighting but it has an easy, pleasant atmosphere.  PP had started to feel kind of assembly - line and it felt like there was no reason to linger over the meal. The check was always rushed even when our table was still chatting.\n\nMy meal was delicious. The wine list was great. But what I loved most was the neighborhood feel.  Eric the manager made a point to ask me my name and to introduce me to all the staff behind the bar. At one point Eric excused himself from our chat to go speak with a new hire. They actually hugged at the host stand like old comrades. He must be part of the old SF PP family as well. \n\nThis world is so pressed for time,  everything feels so rushed, so impermanent.

You can taste almost every ingredient in each recipe.\nThe service is also top tier. I've placed pick up orders, ate at the restaurant, and recently I've been having food delivered through UBER Eats. Obviously, eating at the restaurant is preferred, but the food always tastes the same which is what I believe defines a top quality restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-10-21", "description": "This seals my fate with Vixi now.  Thrice I've visited and all three times, the food was way too salty. I never like to make anyone uncomfortable but I finally couldn't handle it and told the server at the end of my meal (very apologetically) that it was just simple too salty! He told me to order it \"no salt\" next time b/c it could be the pasta cooked in salt water and then the salt garnishing and additional salt for taste at the end.  That's pretty insane.  I didn't eat much of my lunch order and packed it home to doctor it up just to make it edible.  I've been here many times with coworkers (even when it was Pasta Pomodoro) and it's been hit or miss but the last several times have made me feel less incentivized to keep coming back.  The strip on California Street really does get boring (food and probably otherwise) for locals; not a lot of selection to choose from so it's bound to happen that I'll have no choice but to be back...but probably not for a long while though, as long as I can hold off until my rotation of eateries run old. \nIn any case, the service is nice despite the heavy handed salt on food.  The lunch special is great and their sundried tomatoes dip for the bread is a nice touch.", "author": "Tu L."}

Only thing I was disappointed in is they don't give you free bread and olive oil or other dipping sauce like many other Italian restaurants do (including the one at this location before) and sometimes we leave a little hungry after our meal.", "author": "Kristianne M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-14", "description": "We practically live in the hospital next door. So I've been eating here a lot. To the owner, who I think I saw pacing the floor last night when I picked up my pizza (my $10 amazing delicious gourmet pizza which has to be a loss leader), I think you need to do more incentivization of the hospital staff. Give them some amazing discount for 6 months then drop it to something more modest, then something sustainable after about a year. Just realize that the Starbucks next door is open 24 hours because that one resource drives enough traffic to sustain them. It's not the staff that is going to make you so full that people are waiting in line outside (showing the world how great your restaurant is), it's all of us, the patient's families, they will recommend you to who will make the difference. This place needs to be packed out the door. Once you can't hold another human being inside of the building, then you can worry about pricing up to curb the demand and enjoy the spoils. And you can expand. Look at Super Duper Burger. Keep it consistent and keep it awesome. You're off to a great start.", "author": "Marc R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-04", "description": "Dropped into Vixi last night.  Not my usual type of spot and realized I'd never eaten in that location before.  Why?  Oh, yes, because it used to be a Pasta Pomodoro.  I rarely eat Italian (although, I like it) and tend to stay away from chains (except for Taco Bell).  So, enough about me, more about Vixi.  \nThe good:  let me just say that the food was good, and the service was wonderful.  \nThe bad:  not really bad, but odd and easily correctable.  Stupid stuff really, but stuff I noticed.  Don't know when they opened but they seemed to be over staffed on what was possibly an unexpectedly slow night, or maybe it was a training night?  I hope this was an anomaly and not their normal staffing practice.  You might think, what's wrong with too many people?  $$.  I always want business to survive (especially ones with yummy food) and would hate to see them fail early because they don't have staffing tuned in to the needs of a given night.  \nSecond stupid thing to fix:  I'm not sure if they have figured out their identity yet.  The staff have these cheesy t-shirts that don't work with the vibe of the interior and the quality of the food.  And lastly, the other really nit-picky thing...the music.  Don't get me wrong, I liked everything that was playing and have it all, but it just didn't fit the vibe.  I'd go more with cool world beat.  Putamayo has an excellent CD called 'Italian Cafe', start there.  Think Dean Martin, Pink Martini and Paolo Nutini.  \nWhy, you ask, should any of this matter?  Because their food is nuanced in a lovely way and when the space and atmosphere is discordant, it feels off.\n\nSo let's talk more about their food.  Focaccia with olive oil and sun dried tomato paste to start. I had a lovely pasta dish with mushrooms, grilled chicken, sausage and arugula in a cream sauce.  It had a meaty flavor due to the mushrooms but not overwhelmingly so and a subtle sweetness that balanced it out.  Thank you fennel and cream for that.  My husband had the spaghetti with meatballs and he enjoyed it.  The other thing we ordered to share was the faro side.  It needed a little more seasoning.  Either some plain ol' salt n peppah or a shot of an herb to brighten it up.  Lemon zest?  Fresh parsley?  Call me crazy, but an spash of ouzo?  Still, I loved the simple combo of farro, tomatoes and kale.  Good start.  \n\nDear Vixi, keep it going kids.  You've got a great location, beautiful space, fine food and quality people.  I wish you well.", "author": "Kim S."}

Opened the box to find this pizza had NOT ONE DROP of any tomato sauce.. no sauce at all.  It was just the cheese with a thin slice of a tomato laying on top of each slice. Then garnished with some basil shavings.  It wasn't gross, but it wasn't what the menu said it would be.  At all. Won't get pizza there ever again.  They should either change the menu description, or add sauce and remove the tomato slices.  (It's basically just a white pizza.)", "author": "Nic P."}
