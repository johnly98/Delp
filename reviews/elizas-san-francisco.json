{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-04-30", "description": "As a mostly western Chinese restaurant, the food is just above average and overpriced. The Hunan beef and dumplings in particular are the star dishes if you decide to give this mainstay a try. \n\nI have decided to give Eliza's 1 star because all the Hunan beef and dumplings in the world cannot forgive the consistent appalling customer service. It almost feels like you are an inconvenience! Below I will give you two examples of the customer service I have received over the years:\n\n1. Using the company Doordash, I ordered Eliza fried rice, Eliza chow mein, sweet and sour chicken and Hunan beef. Unfortunately, I only received two correct items; I contacted Eliza first and the woman I spoke to tried to blame me for their mistake! To add insult, she also tried to make out that the incorrect items I had received were the correct items. I'm pretty sure deep fried beef cannot pass off as fried rice! In the end, the woman told me there was nothing she could do and to contact the delivery company. No apology, not even a goodbye. I then proceeded to contact Doordash who credited my account with the price of the missing items. \n\n2. I order over $200 of food over the telephone and as it's a Friday night I call an hour in advance of the intended pickup time. Walking into the restaurant, I queue patiently behind 3 individuals waiting to either pick up their order or make an order; the front of house server was walking to and from the kitchen at a zombie pace; 10 minutes later it's my turn and I'm told that my order is nearly ready and to take a seat. Another 10 minutes elapse and during my 20 minute wait, I can't help but notice that only a handful of tables actually have food on their table. Queue alarm bells. Reaching the 25 minute mark, I try to get the attention of a member of staff to ask how much longer my order will be but they are all blatantly ignoring me! I give up because the people that were in front of me when I arrived are also trying to get a servers' attention. Eventually, a full 30 minutes since arriving at the restaurant, the front of house server appears with my food. No apology and no goodbye!\n\nI should also point out that I would not recommend going to this restaurant if there are more than 4 in your group as food can take considerably longer; it's also not the most child friendly!", "author": "Simon Y."}

Got there at 6:15 for dinner and no one else was in the place. We left at 7:30 and there was only one other table of 3 people. Well, the decor is still gorgeous, the food is not quite as good and the waitstaff still so rude. Ruder than ever. I had a question about a dish so signaled the one person on the floor. Sour faced as can be, she asked me what I wanted. I told her softly I just have a question. With one defiant hand on her hip and head cocked meanly to one side, she asked what it was. Well, I told her I did not want to holler all the way across the room so could she come over to our table. She refused. Said there was no one in the restaurant anyway so I could holler it out. Finally our waiter came over and answered the question. Meanwhile, is she wondering why there was no one in the place with nastiness like hers? I will not be going back.", "author": "Janet G."}

It's almost like something out of a Seinfeld episode. The food is good enough that you're willing to overlook the unfriendly staff. Just don't go in expecting servers with a smile or a thank you on your way out. It's not that kind of place.\n\nThat being said, Eliza's certainly serves some of the tastiest (and cleanest) Hunan & Mandarin food in town. I've been here on multiple occasions and tried numerous dishes, and I've never been disappointed. \n\nI'd certainly recommend their pot stickers ($4.95). Although there are only 4 per order, they're rather large dumplings. But if you're splitting dinner with friends, I'd recommend getting two orders.  Other menu highlights include their Drums of Heaven (think Chinese version of fried chicken), Mu-Shu Pork, Spicy Tangy Chicken, and Asparagus Salmon. I'm also a fan of their Chicken Chow Mein and Eliza's Fried Rice.\n\nAll their dishes are never too greasy, which is a common complaint of most Chinese restaurants. And for you health-conscious diners out there, you can order brown rice with your meal instead of the steamed white rice. \n\nThe place is nice enough, I guess. Though the pastel interior reminds me more of a day spa than a restaurant. Personally, I prefer picking up food to go rather than eating at Eliza's. Though the last time I was there, I did see John C. Riley (from Step Brothers) dining in the joint - and that's kind of awesome.\n\nImportant to note - Eliza's closes early (9pm sharp).

Basically a do-it-yourself Asian fajita, the first was assembled tableside by the server, and then you proceed to assemble the remainder as you eat. Very tasty!\n\n- vegetable chow mein: Served in a gigantic pot, this chow mein was loaded (loaded!) with fresh veggies! The proportion of veggies to noodles was excellent -- no skimping here! Just enough soy flavor, and not super oily.\n\n- szechuan broccoli: Probably the blandest of all dishes. While the broccoli was steamed and tossed in a spicy pepper sauce, the heat didn't translate well, so I didn't get the szechuan vibe. Just okay, but skippable.\n\n- spicy eggplant: Oh, dear. So obsessed with eggplant! Once again, melt-in-your-mouth pieces of eggplant that were an edible size and tossed with fragrant basil. Probably the dish that was most oily, but not overpowering enough to take away from the deliciousness!\n\n- vegetarian kung pao with tofu: I have seriously never seen tofu so well-cooked in an Asian restaurant!

Probably the best to-go option for anyone living nearby (or those willing to deal with the nightmarish parking in the area).  \n\nThe decor is an interesting hodge-podge that I can only guess is supplemented anytime the owner looks at a blank area and decides to put something random in said area.  And yet it works. :)\n\nThe food is overall quite good, and pretty well priced.  But don't expect anything traditional/authentic here, the dishes have the same names, but Eliza's own unique preparations.  My favorites:\n\n* Sizzling Rice soup - very light and delicate broth, I think I could make this into my entire meal\n\n* Mongolian beef - deliciously seasoned meat with bits of crispy puffed rice - might sound weird, but it works, excellently\n\n* Hunan salmon - again crispy puffed rice, combined with one of the few preparations of salmon in Chinese cuisine I've ever had that makes me want to come back for more.\n\n* Sunflower chicken - another unusual preparation, and another very memorable dish.  nothing I can really compare it to, but it's a staple for our family\n\n* Garlic eggplant - this is a \"binary\" dish - if you hate eggplant, this won't turn you into a fan.  but if you *like* eggplant, this is a must-have. a little crispy, with a great tangy sauce.\n\n* DRUMS OF HEAVEN - so the drums are drumsticks, and as far as I can tell, they literally come from heaven. SO GOOD.\n\nOne last note - the place is definitely kid-friendly and a great option for the 6pm family rush hour, as it doesn't typically fill up until after 7.", "author": "Jeremy T."}

It is one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in all of SF.\n\nHere's the problem, the service. News flash to Eliza's... people in SF have kids! We were seated with one our well behaved 6 year old. \n\nThere were two other tables (elsewhere in the restaurant) with younger kids who were making a bit of noise and mess. Probably drove the waitstaff into super rude mode because we caught their wrath. \n\nOur waiter (a woman, working on evening of October 7) was downright mean. She made us (four adults) feel as if we were intruding and corrected our order when we wanted more rice. She basically refused to add it to our order. She was also very rude when collecting the dishes. I mean, seriously, it is an art form to be a rude table busser. That takes real talent! \n\nWe had 5 people too and a $60+ check.\n\nWhat made me really disappointed in the service, was the last straw... When we asked for a couple of additional fortune cookies, she rolled her eyes, made some nasty remark under her breath, and disappeared into the kitchen never to be seen again. \n\nI grabbed a second waiter for the cookies and he said \"Yeah, yeah.\" Then yelled at my son for being near the walkway. He was just standing there minding his own business. No waiters were present and we were watching him. So again, BOTH waiters were incredibly rude!!!! \n\nThe cookies never arrived. And we left feeling a bit betrayed by the restaurant where we had spent so much money in the past. \n\nOh yeah, don't try Eric's or Alice's in SF either. Same family. Terrible food on those two.\n\nEliza's does have tasty food, well, two of our four dishes were good. But, DO NOT EAT THERE WITH KIDS!", "author": "Suzanne D."}

It's basically a mixture of pork, wood ear and other assorted vegetables tossed in some sort of light oil or sauce.\n\nHoney Walnut Prawns were delicious. It was sweet, lightly covered in mayo and shell free. I don't usually eat the nuts in the dish, but the walnuts were really crunchy and addictive.\n\nThe Kung Pao Chicken didn't really make an impression on me. The chicken was cut into small bite-size chunks, coated in flour, deep fried to get a crispy crunch and then covered in a spicy Orange Chicken-like sauce.\n\nThe Mongolian Beef, a common staple of Chinese American restaurants, also impressed.

Mind you, at it's best it is spicier and more savory than Comforts of San Anselmo's Chicken Salad, but when it is at its best it is still paltry. Last night was even more so. There were hardly any greens and a disproportionate amount of spices (too much) to the meager amount of lettuce. \n\nUnlike Comforts, their chicken is questionable - it has been sauteed/fried and has been prepared in bits. Although, it is tasty, it is a bit of a mystery . Well, mystery solved; last night my husband and I literally had to spit out 8 to 10 pieces of this 'chicken' as it was pure gristle and bone! \n\nIf you are going to make a smaller salad, keep up the quality! Now when we crave Chinese chicken salad we go to Comforts and pick it up when passing through Marin.", "author": "F C."}

To add insult to injury, the restaurant owner insisted that the front door remained open.  Apparently people tend to walk into the glass door (i.e. something better fixed by putting a sign on the glass instead of leaving the door open).  One of the 4 women seated at the table next to us was wearing her gloves :)\n\nThe service was overall terrible.  Example: after waiting 10min to order, the waiter comes and says we have to order NOW before the kitchen closes.  As we're about to speak he runs off and disappears.  That and other shenanigans became rather entertaining :)\n\nIn all fairness, the food is actually good.

So maybe it was the long meeting.... or maybe it was that it came recommended so highly... but It only made me miss my inner sunset haunt, Nan King Road Bistro.\n\nThis was really good chinese compared to the sloppy, oily \"American\" chinese food that we get used to.... it was crisp, not overcooked (aka good quality food that doesn't need to be oversauced to hide bad quality, etc), and perfect portions and presentations. The grilled eggplant was yummy, the mongolian beef was good, but lacked any real kick that I might expect, and was cooked a bit hard - a little more burnt smoke taste than I might enjoy.

Well, after having 2 waiters walk right up, look at us then leave then come back and look at us again and not say one word I thought to myself, do I have something on my face??\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, this gentleman comes up to me and asks me if I ordered take out and I said no..nevermind the guy who was standing in front of me CLEARLY waiting for his take out. I directed eager beaver to waiting guy and said,' I think he was first\". Well, the host decided to ignore me and says, \" if you're not here to pick up what do you want?\"\n\nYikes.\n\nI said, \"we would like a table for two please\", and flash my winning *smile* ( I admit it..I use my charms to get what I want hehehehe)\n\n\"Oh, we are not seating. You can order to go but sit down is closed\"\n\nNow I just saved my review and checked the times for this place because I don't want to get all nasty if I was in the wrong, BUT...nope.\nIt says 9:30pm on Sunday.\n\nSo, seeing as I clearly was there before 9:30pm it would have been nice to have been seated to eat.\nPerhaps if they don't seat people after 8pm they should state that on their hours, because I did not see anything to that regard anywhere on the premises.\nNevermind the fact that there were 5 or 6 tables with people eating.\n\nThis was added to the previous insults in the last year or two where it would take us 30 mins to be seated when it was clearly not busy and the constant whisking away of the dishes after we had finished and the hovering at the table until the check was paid.  It really ruins the experience and is a turn off to go to a place where you feel like you're not a customer, you're an inconvenience.\n\nNext time I'm going to Yum Yum as so many others have recommended.", "author": "Kathy K."}

Nothing special.\n\nFirst restaurant my boyfriend and I  tried when we  moved to the city. Huge disappointment. We got right in but out of all the tables open they sat us next to the kitchen door. They were frustrated when I wasn't ready to order 1 minute after sitting down. The food wasn't anything special, though  good large portions. We had to ask to get a refill for waters and again received a bad vibe from our server. We feel like  were very polite  and pretty respectful customers but we kept getting a horrible vibe as if we were hassling the server and being an inconvenience to her shift. When the meal ended we didn't eat it all but like I said it was big portioned. They took our plates back into the kitchen to box them up (with a huffing and puffing under their breath). We felt so un welcomed to be there served by this woman that we ended up leaving our leftovers because we figured she was so enraged by us that she  spit in them. We left a decent tip because we generally do even with bad service because we know it's tough being a server. The waitress came to the table and picked up our tip while we were still sitting at the table!!!!!!!! ( get out of my restaurant now, we felt.)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-02-12", "description": "After my experience tonight I realized that we are witnessing the decline of a once great restaurant. Eliza's was a pretty great place last decade, when we started eating there. And up until tonight, we were truly regulars, bringing our family to dine in or for take out at least 2-3 times per month. We could count on unique, flavorful dishes with fresh ingredients, hold the gristle. Also the presentation was always refreshing with flowers, kiwis and other pleasant accoutrements. Interestingly, the one thing that has been a constant over the years has been the rough service (with the exception of the nice gentleman who usually works the front). Almost like the treatment you'd get (and expect) at a great French restaurant. When the food is great and the atmosphere buzzing, the haughtiness just goes with the scene. But tonight, as I was driving on my way to Eliza's to pick up the food we had ordered to go, I came to the conclusion that it's just not worth it anymore. We ordered the food about 30 minutes prior -- when I was 5 minutes from the restaurant, I called Eliza's to ask if they would bring my order from the kitchen to the reception area, since I was so close. As I explained to Jen, the rude lady that answered the phone, I would be double parking to pick up the food, so wanted to shave a few minute off the process. Her answer: \"No!\". Not, \"sorry sir, were very busy now\" or \"I'll try my best.\" Just \"No\". I could not believe the curt and terse response. Needless to say when I arrived at the restaurant I asked to speak to the manager, who had the nerve to say, \"we don't offer curbside delivery service.\" Maybe important to point out that the time was 7:45pm and the restaurant half empty. Lots of staff were slowly shuffling around, failing to acknowledge me or any of the other guests who walked in. So does a restaurant with rude service deserve a one start review? Not necessarily. The food quality is the kicker. We got home to kung pao chicken with almost no chicken -- just a bunch of zucchini. Starchy skins on the potstickers. And the biggest disappointment was our once favorite mango beef. A decade ago, the beef was tasty, the mango crunchy with freshness, and the garnishes popped with liveliness. Tonight: soggy, greasy and limp. Photo uploaded so those of you Eliza's veterans can see the difference. Bottom line is this: Eliza's needs to make some changes to breathe air back into the standard they set a decade ago. And maybe add curbside pickup service, since the tables are not full. Until that happens, I'm going to eat at one of the 1,000 other great Chinese restaurants in San Francisco.", "author": "Eric P."}

Their location on Potrero Hill wasn't too different.  I don't see how it can be so hard to get staff that can have a minimal level of politeness.  Whenever I call in to pick up, they hang up on me as soon as they get my enough to put my oder though, they rush you even when they aren't busy, they just kind of through the food on the table, etc, etc.  So for good food, this is a good place.  And for being treated like shit by their staff, this is also a good place.", "author": "Lucy E."}

I generally dislike Americanized Chinese food restaurants but somehow had gotten to like this place (along with its spinoff, Eric's on Church Street in Noe Valley).  However, I knew this location was still open and I had a chance to visit it earlier this week because it was on the way to a job site.  As usual, I went for my favorite: the House Special duck (for some reason it became my favorite over the years along with a portabello mushroom dish, don't know why).\n\nThe service here was okay that day, but my past experience with the other location was that it could be unfriendly at times.  Therefore, I can understand those who, for that reason, gave this place a low rating.\n\nThe inside decor is nice.  They use tables with glass tops.

The place was crowded.  But not a single Chinese customer, nor even a Chinese menu.  Somehow, this makes sense.  Eliza's isn't a Chinese restaurant, except for a having bad attitude towards customers that don't speak Chinese.\n\nIf you want unobtrusive, pricey, westernized, \"sorta/kinda\" Chinese food, Eliza's will do.

But, even more pleasant, and worthy of note, the service was attentive and friendly (even during a very busy evening.) There was no sense that I was being rushed along, or that they were trying to free up tables for the next set of customers (something I distinctly felt in the past.) \n\nCould it be that Eliza's actually do read their Yelp reviews?

Nice decor for an Asian restaurant, very clean, and real (metal) chopsticks! I was quickly seated, given a menu and hot pot of tea. They have a long list of lunch specials priced between $6-7, including lamb and duck entrees. After ordering, a steaming cup of Hot and Sour soup arrived that was yummy. Not too salty or gingery and nice spicy flavor. Before I finished my soup, my Spicy Chicken with Basil arrived, and it didn't disappoint -- fresh, meaty chicken, crisp sauteed peppers and water chestnuts, and just the right level of spice + basil flavor. It was obvious that it was freshly prepared vs sitting in some warming tray for the past few hours. Finally, and for me this is important, even the fortune cookie with the bill was fresh and crispy :)\n\nThe place does get knocked for bad service. I wouldn't call it bad, just perfunctory.

I used to love Eliza's and I don't know if the quality has changed or my palate has matured, but I'm bummed out. \n\nTo start, I called in at 8:31 and waited on hold until 8:43. I know they close at 9:00, so I had to hang up and call back. When I did, the woman who answered the phone sounded beyond annoyed. I almost hung up right then, but the lure of Eliza's onion pancakes and delicious food demanded that I bear with her, so I went ahead and placed my order. \n\nWhen I arrived to pick up my food, I waited another 5 minutes or so at the front desk before anyone came to check in with me. Eventually, I was able to pay, then quickly scurried across the street where I would dive into my Kung Pao Chicken and Eliza's Cakes. \n\nProblem #1: Is it me, or did the Eliza's Cakes get about 3 times more greasy than they used to be? :{\n\nProblem #2: Ummm...where's the peanut sauce? A couple drops on two of the four slices. The peanut sauce is primarily what made them so irresistible! :(\n\nProblem #3: The Kung Pao Chicken, (which I ordered very spicy) had a remarkably oily and thin sauce that was disappointingly bland. The abundance of dried chilis helped a little, but the sauce was not at all infused with any flavor or heat. :|\n\nProblem #4: I thought I ordered Kung Pao Chicken, not Kung Pao Zucchini. Really, I like zucchini...actually, quite a lot, but it really overpowered the dish and made it difficult to find the tiny scrap of chicken here and there. I suppose I'm better off, because the random piece of chicken that I found was slimy, strange and tasteless. like it had been boiled and added in at the last second to completely prevent it from taking on any flavor from the flavorless sauce. :[\n\nNot at all what I remember.

But when I am just as underwhelmed the second time around, then something must be said. I've been to Eliza's on two occassions for work-related lunches. The only explanation I have for this is that my colleagues probably don't know any better or are too busy to figure out another place to have the end-of-the-semester luncheon.\n\nEliza's seems to be trying to be upscale Chinese...hey, check out the Wedgewood china, the stainless steel chopsticks, the glass-blown sculptures...with that much effort in the details, you would think that they would strive for upscale food. But they're also trying to be mid-priced. It just doesn't add up to me! The food is largely uninspired, and while inauthenticity does not necessarily preclude quality, Eliza's just doesn't measure up to an objective standard of goodness. Sauces are either too salty or undifferentiated (hey is that the same sauce from that other dish?). Seafood not very fresh. I can't even comment further because everything is so unmemorable! Not to mention the service is really whacked out...they had a mad rush to clear our plates, but then took forever and a day to get us our check.\n\n2 stars because their lunch specials ARE pretty cheap (about $6 for entree, brown/white rice, soup) and the food wasn't really inedible. I suppose there is a subset of people who will find Eliza's appetizing, but if it were up to me I would rather spend my money somewhere else.

They've got the same polite but quiet waitstaff, very modern decor, & those fascinating giant fish tanks. You can almost envision members the Chinese Mafia sitting around in a darkened back room wearing $5,000 suits & counting neat stacks of crisp $100 bills. An older gentleman sits behind a desk. He's the man in charge. A much younger man with a scar across his cheek stands smoking an unfiltered cigarette off to the side. He is flanked by two much larger burly men, who only accentuate his badassity. This man is dangerous, & clearly not to be fucked with. It will take one, or perhaps TWO extraordinary cops to take down this operation.\n\nIf I had the money to eat here every night, I'd wait around for two gentlemen resembling Mel Gibson & Danny Glover to walk in. It's bound to happen one of these days...\n\nWhat I'm getting at is this: Eliza's would be The Perfect Restaurant to film a Shootout scene in a Buddy Cop Flick. So eat there at your own risk.

We got totally denied at first by one of the waitresses who was more than happy to tell us to get lost, but then with a whole lot of begging and pleading, another waiter decided to seat us...as long as we agreed that we would order in the next 3 minutes and that appetizers and entrees could come at the same time. Fine by us! No joke...all 6 dishes were on the table in 4 minutes. \n\nSo I'd give E's 5 stars for food, 5 stars for speed of service, but unfortunately, 1 star for friendly service.

So we decided to give it a try for some lunchtime deals.\n\nWe were promptly seated, given some tea and given a couple moments to peruse the menus.  The lunch specials are pretty sweet, soup, rice & entree for under $6.\n\nI had the sweet & sour pork, and she had fried rice, and we had some eggrolls as an app.\n\nThey took our order and almost immediately came back out with some hotnsour soup.  It's probably the best I've had a a restaurant, so I was very pleased.\n\nThen the eggrolls came out.  They're packed REALLY full with the good stuff, and they were delicious, so that's another star for them!\n\nThe pork was pretty good, but the pineapple wasn't very sweet and the grilled tomatoes they mixed in didn't help the dish any as they were pretty flavorless.  The fried rice was good as well, BUT, be aware that it's not just your plane ol' fried rice.  They throw in quite a lot of chicken, beef & pork.  So even though it was really good, if you're a vegetarian, just ask first if there's a veg version.\n\nSo, overall, the service is excellent and fast, the food is great, the decor is simple and it isn't too loud inside.  You can actually have a pretty good conversation, even when it gets a little crowded.  Also, the place is impeccable.  As we were leaving, just after the lunchtime rush, they were frantically cleaning up on top of and underneath all the tables, almost as if they all had OCD.  So I'm impressed with their cleanliness.\n\nThe only thing that robs it of a star is, although the service is fast, it's not very warm.  Basically, the moment they get you in, they're trying to get you out for the next customer.  But they're not rude about it, and do it with a kind smile, so it's no big deal.", "author": "Jonathan B."}

Let me note, my wife and I got into a minor argument. I had ordered The Sweet and Sour chicken over rice which is what I frequently had at the other location. I took a bite and it tasted a bit smoky and burnt. In fact, I could see some black spots in parts of the chicken. I said to myself \"oh well I can deal with it.\" and continued eating. But no. It was to disturbing. So I asked the waitress and she brought me the manager or at least the \"acting\" manager. As soon as I tell him what was going going on, he leaves. He then returns telling me that the food was fine, that he tasted the batch from where my food came from and it tasted absolutely normal. I said \"no, it taste burnt.\" He then went back and returned with a bowl of the sweet and sour chicken I was eating. He ate it in front to prove to me the food taste as it should. At this point I was upset and insisted he bring me the menu so that I may choose something else. \n\nHe then noticed my wife hadn't said anything and looked upset, so he bluntly asked if everything was ok between us. I immediately told him that wasn't his business.\n\nLong story short: he insisted on the food and continued to get into our marital disagreement. Finally i told him I wouldn't  eat it nor would I order anything else. I requested the check and he was charging me for the food that I did not eat because \"nothing was wrong with it.\"\n\nI demanded he adjust the amount and so he did.  His last comment as I walked to the door was \"dude I have a girlfriend, and you just have to keep it inside.\" advising on how to, I guess, comunicate with my wife as if he knew what was going on.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I work in a food industry and if someone says their food taste bad or funny, I take it back without arguing with them for 10 minutes and on top of that, I don't barge into their lives asking them whether or not they have solved their marital issues.

It was pretty good. Just not authentic Chinese cuisine. \n\nWe finally ate here at a friend's recommendation, who was of course present to guide us through our experience.\n\nWe were all hungry so we went all out: combination appetizer platter (crab rangoon, potstickers, fried chicken drumstick, spring rolls, shrimp chips), sizzling rice soup, special prawn, hunan beef, sesame chicken, and szechuan broccoli.\n\nThe appetizer platter was okay. The spring roll was standard. I tasted a bit of the chicken drumstick with an interesting seasoning. It almost seemed to be fried in panko bread crumbs. The crab rangoon was weird - fried wonton filled with a lot of cream cheese and hardly any crab. Definitely my least favorite item of the evening. \n\nThe sizzling rice soup was good: chock full of scallop, shrimp, water chestnut, fried rice, chicken. \n\nOur friend thinks the sesame chicken is the best dish served at Eliza's. It was definitely the most interesting dish: the chicken is cut in strips and on a bed of julienned carrot, celery, green onion, zucchini and sprinkled with sesame and black sesame seeds. This was a tasty Chinese fusion dish.\n\nThe hunan beef was very tasty but essentially mostly deep fried batter in sauce with snow peas. The flavor and texture were good but there was very little actual meat.\n\nThe szechuan broccoli was disappointing. Regular broccoli with szechuan sauce on top. I ordered it thinking it would be chinese broccoli.\n\nThe special prawn dish was okay. The prawn was stir-fried with sugar snap peas in a red sweet and sour sauce. \n\nTwo of us had brown rice and one had regular steamed white rice. Our friend who ordered the white rice complained that it was like Uncle Ben's - not sticky and soft like true Asian rice. \n\nService was efficient though somewhat impersonal. \n\nAll in all, I'm glad I ate here.

Their dishes satisfy your Chinese food cravings, without making you feel like you've participated in a greasefest. I have been searching for another nearby go-to Chinese food place and so far nothing has come close. Looks like the next time I can't control my rainy day Hot & Sour soup cravings, I will be making the trek across town.", "author": "Gretchen N."}

I've lived in the neighborhood for 5 years and they're consistant in impersonal if not occasionally rude service.  The take out is great, you don't have to deal with them.  \n\nThe food is amazing, and is some of the best that I've had.  It's fairly cheap, especially considering how good it is.  The hunan salmon and mango beef are two of my favorite dishes, but all the specials I've tried there are amazing.  The ingredients are fresh and not over cooked.  Nothing seems frozen or overly sauced.  \n\nI've noticed a little decline in quality in the last two years.  I hope they're able to change that.  I should really be a 5 star place.", "author": "Evan A."}

Good if you want quick, bad if you don't want to feel rushed out. They take plastic here, which is good, because the price is, well, a bit much for Chinese. Local Pac Heights professionals and their perfect looking high school kids seem to claim the place as theirs. Eating a lunch special there will get you alot of food with several sides or courses. I recommend the Lemon Shrimp or the Mango Ostrich. To be honest, though, I can't be sure this is genuine ostrich. \n\nThis certainly isn't authentic Chinese, more like CA fusion that took the idea of Chinese and ran off with it. But it being essentially Chinese food, I think the elegant interior, the clientele, and the price seems like fancy dress to cover up the fact that it's much less. Like wearing the emperor's clothes, or being a poser, and hoping no one catches on to their ruse. If you want equally good Chinese without paying for the name or the restaurant's decor maintenance, go to Ben Wah, which is hidden in plain sight just across and down the street.", "author": "Clar L."}

I feel there's a real disparirty between the 3 star (I'm not going to bother myself going there) and the 4 star (I make an effort to eat there) restaurant.  At least that's what I read into reviews when I'm looking for a new place to try.\n\nAnyway, I would give Eliza's a 3.5.  The food is pseudo-authentic Chinese with your standard Chinese fare, but other than that the restaurant doesn't feel all that ethnic.  If you're not overly concerned with it being authentic, I think the food is pretty darn good, and reasonably priced as well.  I find it a really comfortable place to go grab a bite, and the food consistently leaves me satisfied and happy.  The service is lack luster and never friendly, but I like that they always provide complimentary tea.  The best part, of course, is the giant vase of Hershey's chocolate kisses that you can't miss on the way out.", "author": "Dubs W."}

For about six bucks (plus tip, if you believe in tipping), you get a bowl of soup, an entree with your choice of rice, a pot of tea, all the water you can drink, and a fortune cookie.  Now that's what I call a good deal.\n\nAre people really rating this place based on the decor?  If anything, the biggest eyesore is the uniform that the wait staff wears.  You'll feel like you're walking into the Gap, circa '95.  So much denim.  None of that even matters though, because you won't have time to form an opinion on the aesthetics.  You're literally in and out in ten minutes, which is far less time than I've waited at any In N Out during the lunch rush.\n\nThe food is your typical Americanized Chinese.  Clean, no MSG, stupid metal chopsticks.  With Eliza's, it's the price and the service that keeps me coming back.  Also, they serve this really good soup on Wednesday.

I'm tired of super greasy, fatty, cooked ahead of time Chinese food, and I, unless coerced, usually don't go.  I always leave feeling like I'm gonna hurl, and then end up hungry just a few hours later.  With that being said, I had no idea i was going for Chinese last night.  Especially with a name like Eliza's.\n\nJust a hop, skip and a jump away from my place, I had NO idea this place existed.  I don't think i realized it was a Chinese restaurant when I first walked in either.  Bright white walls, with accents of modern decor and color, and a very \"new\" feel to it still had me confused.  Most Chinese restaurants scream \"someone went to china town, bought alot of crap and threw up\".  Not this one.  I could tell right away this one was gonna be different.  Not your typical Chinese food restaurant.  They had zebras on the plates, a half-dead Beta fish in the fanciest fish bowl...(it wasn't dead, just kept disappearing), and a Buddha holding a glowing ball by his balls that changed color.\n\nThe first thing that had me second guessing the authenticity of the Chinese restaurant is when the rest of my party (a few including two of the coolest yelpers i know) ordered individual entrees.  What?  We aren't sharing?  Isn't that how we are supposed to eat Chinese?  Oh, you have been here before and the answer is no..OK.   So i went with one of their specials,  Pan seared scallops served with shitake mushrooms.  Perfectly portioned, perfectly cooked, definitely a meal for one.  Oh, but i forgot to mention the appetizer...We shared a crab rangoon that was served with a great sweet and sour sauce and a spicy mustard.  And guess what.  The mustard was spicy.  They don't lie. The rest of my table seemed to enjoy their entrees, and the ones i tried were awesome.  The spicy and tangy chicken was just that...spicy and tangy, and the Chinese Broccoli and beef was great too.  The only one I didn't try was the Hunan Salmon, but i didn't need to.  It was served in what looked like a giant hat that you would wear to the Kentucky Derby....with these really tall friend noodles (the ones that are like crunchy air), and the appearance alone was 5 stars.  \n\nOnly one thing about this meal had me worried.

I also find it irksome when places like this list a \"$9 per person minimum\" on their menus.  If I want to come in and order a veggie dish that costs $7.15, is that really such a problem for them?

I know that might be hard to believe, but try it.  You'll see I'm right.  Lunch is great.  They have a huge and varied menu.  My favorite: House Duck with vegetables.  Some of the best duck I've had in my life.  Their attention to detail is astonishing.  Beautiful presentation, top quality ingredients (vegetables & meat), generous portions.  Soup, entree, choice of rice for under $6.  Dinner is just as good.  I've taken several large groups here where we ordered at least one of everything on the menu, and we were blown away by each dish.

Second, a third of their business is takeout, but they treat it as an afterthought: the waiter who brings the takeout bags to the front of the restaurant has to talk to you three times (in between each time, he walks slowly to the kitchen and back), once to ask your name, another time to ask for your credit card, and a third time to bring you the receipt for signing---all of this despite the fact that they know you're double-parked outside.

It started when my friend's ice water glass broke at the bottom for no apparent reason, spilling ice water all over her. We notified the Manager, \"Richard\", who moved us to another table. When my friend said she was really upset that she was now drenched with ice water due to a defect in the restaurant's glass (or else they may have poured ice water into a hot glass which is why it cracked?), all \"Richard\" could say was, \"good thing it wasn't vinegar\". She was rather surprised at this callous remark, as \"Richard\" did not seem to empathize with the fact that she was now freezing cold, because of the restaurant's defective glass. Then at the end of the meal, we were given a full bill! Her portion was only about $7.00, and the restaurant didn't want to comp my friend's lunch (at the very least) for the trouble their defective glass caused her? We were appalled. When we asked to speak to \"Richard\" about this, he was shocked that we asked him to comp my friend's lunch, and started arguing with us about this. Only when my friend and I walked out without paying, and he followed us down the block (about a block away) did he finally agree to comp my friend her lunch, but very grudgingly and with a mean attitude. He later told us after we asked his name and he told us \"Richard\", that his name wasn't really Richard!\nThis was my friend's first time to this restaurant, but not mine.

I work nearby, and have gone there a number of times for lunch. The lunch specials range from $5.60-$6.50, and come with soup, rice, and a generous portion of entree.\n\nBUT, my experience there today lost them major points in my book. They get docked a full two stars for what I consider to be DISHONEST business practices. The bill comes written all in Chinese, which is fine, pretty standard for Chinese restaurants, but they don't list the prices individually. Instead, they just give you a total. In the past, I've just split the bill evenly with my group. But today, we all ordered differently-priced things, so we probed a little bit to figure out who owed what. \n\nAs it turns out, they were charging extra for brown rice, even though it didn't say so anywhere on the menu, and they offered it to you like it was free! Also, instead of calculating the sales tax exactly, they just rounded it up to the nearest 50 cents. It's fine with me if a business wants to do this for simplicity's sake, but they should then list the FULL price on the menu, and write \"tax included.\" If not, they are essentially stealing from you. Granted, for my $6.50 asparagus salmon (which was tasty, though a bit too salty), the extra cost to me was pretty small. But I consider this a pretty dishonest way of doing business, especially since they disguise it by just giving you your total on the bill! \n\nNot ok, Eliza's, not ok.", "author": "Amy H."}

Several different staff members assisted us and all interactions were fine. \n\nOur companions are regulars to the Divis location and say the horror stories are a thing of the past. We did have an early start (5:45) so it wasn't too crowded and there was no need to rush us.\n\nThe ambiance? A bit funky with an odd and cluttered assortment of physical objects on display. So many Chinese restaurants have a space and are furnished with all the charm of a hospital cafeteria with too bright fluorescent lighting that I'm not going to complain.\n\nNow, most important, the food: I'm not Chinese, I've never been to China and I unfortunately do not get to enjoy Chinese home-cooking, so I have no clue what \"authentic\" really means in this case. (For what it's worth, I went to Bangkok for a week and the food I was served there bore little resemblance to what you get in most Thai restaurants here, which I generally love.) \n\n(And secondly for what it's worth, most SF residents I've spoken with on the subject of Japanese food have a notion of \"authentic\" and clearly they don't know jacksquat. Take sushi as an example. Here's an SF rule of thumb: Cheap sushi = good. Lines of people on Geary don't seem to mind stringy tuna as long as it's $3.95 a serving.)\n\nBack to Eliza's: The food was excellent. Our companions had the special, Peking Duck. They loved it and always order it when they come. My wife and I eat a largely vegetarian diet and enjoyed everything else: The grilled Garlic Eggplant appetizer with moo-shu sauce drizzle; the large Veggie Eggrolls with tender cabbage inside; the Kung-pao Vegetables, which had an inordinate amount of those little red hat peppers yet the dish wasn't overwhelming spicy; the Braised Pea Greens (I've made up the name of this one), it was a dish of very mild tasting, somewhat salty greens with a small amount of julienned peppers  -- delicious.\n\nAnd I've saved the best for last: The GREEN BEANS. Cooked to crisp-tender perfection, drizzled with moo-shu sauce like the eggplant, sprinkled with sesame seeds. Utterly fantastic.\n\nA couple of bucks a plate more than the typical Chinese restaurant but definitely worth it. We'll certainly be back.", "author": "Gary R."}

It's 8.50!\" \nAt which point he re-appeared and my wife said we'd order to go. Hence the man then started on about how he'd just been yelled at by someone right before us and how rude people were.

After screaming in our face that the recipe was 100 years old and refusing to strike the dish from our bill, he followed us out asking my bf if he wanted to kick his ass. Good business strategy, buddy.  Anyway, if you're going to pay too much for Chinese, it may as well be worth the food, ambiance and service.  My recommendations: Shanghai 1930 or House of Nan King.  Both of which have excellent, shelled salt and pepper prawns.", "author": "Lia J."}

It's very average chinese food, but reasonably priced.  My gripe is that this place has absolutely terrible service.  The staff is unfriendly and unattentive.  I don't think I saw anyone crack a smile all night.  The only reason they get 2 stars is because it's reasonably priced, and it's conveniently located next to Solstice.", "author": "clancy t."}

That was until I truly noticed how plain terrible the waiters and waitresses were.  On one occassion, they overcharged us 12 dollars.  The bill had only had two chinese letters and a numerical value of 36 dollars.  This was most shocking considering that I went with 3 other people and we all ordered 5 dollar lunch specials.  We complained and paid only 32 dollars without tip.  Unable to understand that the bill was way over what it should have been, they banned us from eating-in.  I turned from being a loyal customer who visited twice a week, to officially banning it myself, even after being invited back to eat in by them after realizing that they had shutdown a loyal customer.  A normal business would have corrected the bill but their snotty nature and terrible business ethics prohibited such acts of generosity.  DO NOT VISIT THiS LOCATION.", "author": "Patrick C."}

I do have to give it props for having pretty nice decor for a chinese restaurant. Its clean from top to bottom doesnt have a rough feel whatsoever. I would probably even go on to say that for some reason it feels and tastes healthier. Priced higher but its probably the location. All the staff speak English clearly which is nice. Too bad its hard to find parking and they close in sometime between 3pm and 5pm.", "author": "J L."}

Asked if they were still serving and they said yes. Then after they brought the food they started snatching the dishes away before we were done. And we weren't wasting time, we were actually putting the food in our mouths! When I complained the head guy said essentially, tough luck. Dont come back if you don't like it.

We came here for dinner at 5:30p on a Sunday night. We were 2 people & the place was empty. I asked if it would be possible to get their pea sprouts with tofu added (I was willing to pay extra for it). They would not do it. Said no special orders. I have never been to a chinese restaurant (or most others for that matter) that is not willing to accommodate simple special requests. It got worse from there. Our waitress came over to take our order. We asked her a couple of additional questions about the menu & she seemed really annoyed. So we left. There are enough restaurants in town that seem to want the business but Eliza's wasn't one of them.", "author": "susan s."}

I heard about it a few years ago and just never got around to trying it until last night.  All I can say is I haven't got one complaint about my experience--not one.  The food was beautifully presented and absolutely delicious, the service was fantastic, the atmosphere was lovely and the prices were very reasonable.  I can see why there are so many good reviews here and why people have been telling me to try Eliza's all this time.  So do yourself a big favor and dine at Eliza's.  I know the parking situation is pretty bad over there so if you can use public transportation all the better.  And if you want to have Eliza's at home, just call them and place an order for pickup (they don't deliver, unfortunately).  Just bring someone with you to drive the car around the block because double-parking is a big no-no on California Street and you don't want to get a ticket and ruin your dinner now do you?", "author": "Rabbit B."}
