We walked in on Friday, May 26th around 5:30pm.\n\nThey have happy hour 4pm-7pm, but I'm wasn't sure what qualified as a HH special. I ended up getting a Jameson on the rocks and my friend, a gin and tonic. I believe both drinks were under $10? I didn't get this round, so I'm not really sure, but I think that's what he said.\n\nWe started off playing a few rounds of darts up front. I suck at darts, but it was fun just playing a game, drinking, and catching up. We moved on to pool afterwards in the back. Games are $1 each and you can get quarters from the bartender as it is coin operated. We got a second round of drinks and while playing our first game, another friend joined us. I suck at pool as well, so I let him take over the game. The boys played two more games while I finished my drink. And maybe had a third round? I can't really recall if my friend bought a third round of drinks after he showed up.\n\n540 is a little divey, but it's a fun bar. I had a good time playing games and drinking. I haven't been here in forever, so it was nice revisiting an old bar. They have TVs as well, so it'd be great to throw back some drinks while catching a game. A fun stop while hanging out in Inner Richmond.", "author": "Elena N."}

I came in with my friend Jon P. at around 3:30 on a Monday afternoon, planning to hang out before a reading at Green Apple at 7. Those three and a half hours slipped right by, with more friends joining us as the day went on. I probably overdid it a bit, but I had lots of fun.\n\nThe place was mostly empty the whole time we were there. I really liked the space. It was comfortable with a nice, low-key atmosphere, a truly lovely neighborhood bar. Jon and I sidled up to the bar and got drinking quickly. The bartender was awesome, very helpful and friendly, giving us tastes of this or that beer when we expressed interest. I don't remember exactly what I drank, to be honest, but I definitely had a couple beers on tap for something like $4 apiece during happy hour (or maybe just Monday hour?). At some point I tried some of the Death & Taxes, a great beer I'd never had before.\n\nThe only hiccup was that 540 Club is cash only, and the ATM was not having it with my card. Luckily, I found a Wells Fargo ATM around the corner, and evaded both the machine troubles and the corresponding withdrawal fees. The faulty machine worked to my advantage in the end, I guess, but probably not a great feature overall.\n\nIn any case, I had a great time at 540 Club and would definitely come again on any future visits to the Inner Richmond.

This place has terrible cocktails--primarily because their bartenders are more interested in getting you drunk cheaply than in mixing a great drink. If you ask for anything above a well drink, expect the person on staff to try to talk you down to something crappier. I don't think they even stock very many upper tier liquors.

Do we value good live music or unique jukebox selections or attractive clientele or the fact that the bartenders will still serve you after you've thrown up all over the urinal? \n\nIs it enough to say that some bars rock your socks because they just rock the socks like no other sock-rockers? Maybe not. Maybe I've forfeited all my Useful votes on this one.\n\nBut it doesn't matter. The 540 Club rocks my damn socks. It just does. It rocks because no bar in the Inner Clement rocks quite like the 540 Club. I just got all tautological on your ass. You're welcome.\n\nOK, fine.

It's exciting in the way that going to Costco is exciting. You think, drink, feel, and act in bulk. For five bucks, it's easy to get good and sloppy.\n\nHere's my sick rationalization: since dollar drinks are only from ten to midnight, you'll want to stock up. You'll hoard a pile of drinks like they're cash, like you're storing booze for a long winter. You'll still be flattered when a stranger offers to buy you a drink, even if it's in fucking quarters.\n\nThat's how Monday nights are at 540 Club. But it's okay.\n\nThis sounds fun, economical even, but it's bad news too. Chances are, you'll talk to people you wouldn't even share the bathroom line with.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-04-06", "description": "I have this \"thing\" with Mondays.\n\nI used to just flat out hate Mondays, but somewhere in the last few years, that changed.  I decided to reconfigure the week to make Monday the last day of the \"weekend\", at least in mind.  It's helped immensely in extending the \"weekend\" feel and shortening the work week.  It's amazing how quickly Friday comes when you have to only go through Tuesday - Thursday.\n\nSo all too often, at about 2-4 PM on Mondays, I start thinking, \"Happy Hour Time!\"  My friends have transformed into creatures who fear the inevitable text or e-mail from me on Mondays stating location, time, and plans.\n\nYesterday - the text that went out was, \"Happy Hour @ 540 Club. 6:30 tonight. Dinner at Shabu House after.\"\n\nI received texts back, most starting with, \"Seriously - what is it with you and Mondays?\" only to confirm that they will be attending.\n\nWell, I had picked 540 Club because a quick search on Yelp showed me that Mondays are $1 drinks at 540.  WRONG!  \n\nMORE ACCURATE: \nMondays have a regular \"happy hour special\" from 5-7 pm, and then from 10PM to closing, they have $1 specials on well liquors.\n\nAlright, so my \"cool\" plans of hosting a $1 Happy Hour went down the drain, but a big group of us (16 planned, 12 showed) gathered to drink our regularly-priced drinks.\n\nImmediately - 540 gained points for having \"Death and Taxes\" Black Beer.  Delicious stuff.  But Hoegaarden was also on tap - and the \"planner\" in me decided that this would be a better first choice as I'd taste nothing else after the black beer.  Additional props for having Leffe, in addition to Guinness and other beers on tap.\n\nThe bartender, however, claimed he made a mean basil gimlet.  Anyone who knows me knows I head only to 83 Proof for this stuff, but a couple of my friends gave him a chance.\n\nMOVE OVER, 83 - - 540's basil gimlet ROCKED.\n\n540 also has several tables and chairs outside for smokers.  Bing bing bing - additional points.  It becomes a perfect good-weather \"grab a beer\" spot instantly.\n\nIt's far.  It's at Clement and 7th, and takes me a whopping 20 minutes to get here.  Parking should have been pretty difficult (common in this area), except I scored royalty parking right across the street.  The decor is cozy and casual - there is nothing fancy about this bar, but it makes for a cool hangout with friends.  But it's still WAY out there, far from the other more popular hangouts.\n\nWell, that said - the business consultant in me says that 540 could be packed all night long (instead of being sparsely populated like it was when I was there) with the right marketing, and become a favorite \"happy hour\" spot in the city if they would make \"happy hour\" all night long.  Some time ago, Palomino (located on Embarcadero, no less) changed their happy hour to a \"happy hour every day, all day\" policy, and since then, it's been a packed house.  In this economy, cheap drinks and a location with lots of eateries immediately catapults a business as a \"GREAT\" hangout.\n\nUnfortunately, the confusing $1 from ___ to ___ and $2 on other days for this and that makes it confusing.\n\nThat confusion prevents me from giving this place four-stars.  It's not the bar's fault that their happy hour time limitations weren't reviewed accurately by all Yelpers, but throw in the location (Richmond - no parking - cold) and I'm not that thrilled about it.  \n\nBut factor in the fabulous basil gimlets and the great beers on tap - and I can't help but throw in one more star.  It's not a four-star location by any means, but it's just *kinda* cool anyway.", "author": "Grace K."}

He was super friendly, and told me he'd be happy to have me have my party there (phew!), that they never rent the place out for private events so it wouldn't be a problem.  He thanked me for thinking of them and told me maybe he'd blow up some balloons for me with the helium tank he had in the back, haha.\n\nFast forward to the night of my birthday...I show up about 8:45 and snag one of the side tables with some friends.

Come on, folks, use your heads.  It is also clear that this policy is not required because passports lack physical descriptors, as my friends passport has these descriptors.\n\nMy pet theory is that this place has had problems with ABC before due to underage drinking and have decided to run no more risks, perhaps for fear of losing their liquor license.  It's also believable that underage drinkers were slipping past their Sherlock Holmes bouncer with unfamiliar forms of identification.  So, in keeping with a \"locals only\" clubhouse mentality, someone decided to enforce a unique, draconian, and fallacious interpretation of ID requirements in California. \n\nNow, to be clear, I don't blame the bouncer, or even the smoking area peanut gallery who were quick to point out that this was \"the law\" (it isn't) - my problem is with the management.  Clearly this is their policy, and although I recognize they are free to enforce it, I am similarly free to write a disappointed review and to never patronize this place again.", "author": "joe b."}

The drinks are cheap, the music is good, the crowd is friendly, and the bartenders are generally good people - though I don't know the latest generation all that well. \n\nHaving gone to law school right up the hill at USF, I've come to love the place, so I feel compelled to clarify the whole passport issue via a 5 min google search - though if you had a run in with Ken on the issue, I'm sure he explained it at the time. \n\nAll bars within the state of California are governed by CA Business and Professions Code 25660 which, in relevant part,  states: \n\n25660. (a) Bona fide evidence of majority and identity of the \nperson is a document issued by a federal, state, county, or municipal \ngovernment, or subdivision or agency thereof, including, but not \nlimited to, a motor vehicle operator's license or an identification \ncard issued to a member of the Armed Forces, that contains the name, \ndate of birth, description, and picture of the person. \n\nThe last line is the key - the \"[b]ona fide evidence of majority  . . .that contains the name, date of birth, description, and picture of the person.\" \n\nNow go look at your passport. Note it has your name, date of birth and a picture of you. So by process of elimination, what is it missing? That's right kiddies - a description. Unlike a valid drivers license it does not have your height, weight, eye color and hair color, therefore it does not meet the CA requirements. If your ID does not meet these requirements,  540 cannot claim the affirmative defense of reliance on a state/federal ID in subsection c of the above code. \n\nThey are just following the CA law that other bars break on a daily basis. It has nothing to do with whether or not Jamie (the owner) et. al.  \"realiz[es] that San Francisco is full of Europeans, South American, Canadian, Asian and African nationals.\" \n\nIt is akin to taking a taxi home at the end of a drunken night instead of driving - some people are willing to risk the headache of police involvement to save a buck (or in this case make a buck) and some aren't. 540 falls into the latter. In the long run it is better for business. \n\nNow stop your crying and get on with your life.", "author": "Brendan W."}

Of the three years that I've been patronizing this bar (off and on, of course), there always seems to be something wrong with the floor - like they were going to get it repaired, but then just said screw it! Yet, they feature different types of art work, that is usually really cool, and resonably priced. They usually feature some type of DJ music on the weekends - it's more like an \"open-mike set\" rather than a professional DJ session, but then again, I've never had to pay a cover. \n\nGood things often come in strange packages, and that's the best way I can describe the 540 club.

I wish Jamie (the owner) would hire a professional crew to clean this place regularly.\n\nGood:  Most Giants/49ers/Raiders games are shown here, but with the sound off.\n\nBad:  I can't think of anything else.\n\nGood:  $2 pints of Pabst all the time.\n\nGood:  Excellent selection of beers.  Especially high-alcohol beers.  Chimay on tap!\n\nGood:  The bar is dog friendly (at least before 7:00 p.m.)  There are a handful of  dogs who visit regularly and who everyone knows and loves.  The bartenders dispense doggy treats.\n\nGood:  Sells more shots of Chartreuse than any other place in the world.  Honestly, this is true.  A shot of chilled Chartreuse at the 540 is one of the best drinks in the world.  (Be sure to order one for the bartender as a tip . . . .)\n\nGood:  Free barbecue on Sunday afternoons.  It's supposed to start at 3:00 p.m., but that's sketchy.  Figure somewhere between 3:00 and 7:00.  At minimum it will be free hot dogs and hamburgers.  If you're lucky there'll be grilled veggies, or marinated chicken, or gourmet sausages, or even fillet mignon.  Free.  Couple that with $2 pints of Pabst . . . . .\n\nTry the 5:40 during daylight hours on a weekend, and I guarantee that you will like it.", "author": "John H."}

Our team is usally 1st or 2nd (often more the latter) and we are pretty good at winning the team name competition, with clever takes on topics of the week.\n\nNot to mention that visitors may well find yours truly spinning records or doing the BBQ itself.\n\nMy BBQ debut was particularly fun. I don't often cook for a large amount of people, so I really wanted to make a good impression. So, instead of the usual burgers 'n' dogs bit, I went whole hog: chicken legs marinated in red wine w/ bbq sauce mixed in, tri-tip marinated in it's own juices w/ herbs 'n' spices, and salmon that was basted with olive oil, lemon and herbs. I whipped up a giant green salad with my special balsamic vinagrette, and added in some chips with freshly-made salsa from a spot I found in the Mission. \n\nSorry, but I won't divulge all of my secrets as to the particulars. Don't even try to ask. Sounds pretty tasty, though, right? It was, although a few regulars, and Jamie 540 himself missed out. Too bad.\n\nAnother good thing: the 540 was written about in the High Times article mentioned elsewhere in my reviews, particularly for their large consumption of Chartruese. It made an impact on my friend, and he felt compelled to write about it. \n\nPretty cool no?", "author": "ACE A."}

Recently, however, some colleagues began to frequent the bar, and I decided to tag along with them one day.  It was a good experience, and I would go back.\n\nStart with the atmosphere.  It's rare you find a place in the inner Richmond that you can sit outside and enjoy a beer.  Of course, it's usually 10 degrees F outside, so that mitigates the benefit somewhat.  The biggest challenge I had were the chairs.  The seats are composed of a set of horizontal bars (from the perspective of looking at the chair).  Nearly every chair had half the bars gone.  Think of sitting on a rope, and you'll understand where I'm coming from.  So a big plus for outdoor seating, but they should go to costco and buy a few new chairs.\n\nThe interior was a little dive-y, which I like.  The place used to be a small movie theater, and kept some of the features.  In fact, they were playing a movie when we went - sideways - which isn't the best choice when you have no sound.  In keeping with the star, I would have gone with the Big Lebowski.  Crowd wise, it was an eclectic mix, with some young financial district types intersecting with an alternative crowd I would more often find at the Toronado.  As a heterosexual guy, I wouldn't come here to get lucky, as your choices are limited.  If I was a girl, I wouldn't come here to get lucky, as while you have choices, this isn't really a pick-up scene.\n\nOn to the beer.  I ordered a La Chouffe.  Thrilled to see it on tap.  It wasn't cheap, but what do you expect from a beer made by gnomes.  Unfortunately, either it was stale or the line hadn't been cleaned in some time, because it didn't taste good.  We moved on to Leffe, which is an adequate Belgian and making a big marketing push globally.  A fresh keg, just the right temperature and a great alcohol per $ ratio.  Not bad for a mass market beer (usually when I think Belgian I think monk's and cork tops).  They had a few other selections on tap - enough to satisfy most beer drinkers.\n\nOverall, it's a nice bar to have in the Richmond.  I wouldn't drive across town to visit, but if you are close by, it's worth a stop in.", "author": "Mike C."}

The digi jukebox is always playing something cool, be it the Stooges or the New York Dolls, and I never have to fear being assaulted by some horrible techno or (god forbid) drum & bass nonsense. \n\nThe booze selection is great and there's not a pretentious iota about this joint, which is why I love it. PBR for $2- now that's what I'm talkin' about!! I'll walk out of a place that serves Pabst for $5, they'd probably want to make me drink it with my pinkie extended or only serve it because it's \"ironically downscale.\"  Bartenders at the 540 are cool and would probably do a shot with you (tho you don't deserve it). \n\nThey also seem to have drink specials out the yang, because whenever I simply walk by this place headed to Green Apple, the 540 has a huge chalkboard out front on the sidewalk with killer specials and upcoming events listed. It's a wonder I MAKE it to Green Apple. \n\nGreat smoking patio out front with 5 or 6 tables and room to stand. Never annoyingly crowded (tho they get a large crowd on big holidays), and never so dead you feel like a degenerate just for being in there (and I've been in there at like 2PM on a Tuesday and have a natural proclivity to feel like a degenerate). \n\nThey always have the Giants or Monday Night Football on the TV. Happy hour is always a treat, and you can actually play darts here which is a biggie for me. \n\nPlus, there's always some wacky crap going on at the 540- they have a boisterous Halloween party every year (this year they showed \"Rocky Horror\"), and I walked in last Xmas season and they were showing \"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" on the projection TV! Man, that brightened the holiday.", "author": "Steve M."}

Both probably not the average experience at a dive bar in the Richmond, let alone 540 club.\n\nVisit 1 -  Home of what i have come to know as the shortest date ever.  Here's the story, so i make out with this hot guy in a band....cuz he tells me ill get a free CD if i do.  It didn't play out exactly like that and if you were to hear the story from me, its really not as bad and whorey as it sounds...honest.  Now, he doesn't have the CD on him that night, so we set up to meet at 540 club a week later, cuz i did my part, now its his turn, and he wants to see me again anyway....I'm that good.  :)    He walked in a few minutes after me and the bar was empty, so we had the bartenders full attention.  My date spent the majority of the time trying to see if he could get his friends to spin in the back, and possibly rent out the place for a private party.  So i guess that's cool.  That option is there.  DJ's spin?  Private parties?  Sweet.   Drinks were strong, and the bartender even gave us a free one, but seeing as though my date and myself had both had really long weekends and this was a Sunday evening....he walked me to my car after 1.5 hours, kissed me goodbye, and I went on my way.  Home by 9.\n\nVisit 2 - Flash forward many months later....i completely forgot about this bar, and lo and behold the DYL has its last leg there this past Friday.  I got there before the swarm of other Yelpers, Sammy S. bought me a beer, and we watched the party start.  To be honest, at this point i was wasted already, probably didn't need the beer, but  I had a great time anyway.  Bartenders were pretty quick for the mass amounts of people, and the layout was pretty accommodating.  Benches around the bar make for good seating...a patio out front gives the option for smokers to sit and enjoy their drinks....and Yelpers surrounding you give you ample opportunity to say stupid shit, do things you normally wouldn't do, and somehow avoid paying for any drinks.\n\nI would and will most definitely come back here....maybe next year for Catholic School Girl Karaoke?

So, we went after dinner last night.\nIt was ok.  I like the lighting and loved the huge screen showing Better Off Dead.  The DJ was rockin' the place with great music, as well.\nOn the downside, the vomit stench was pretty damn strong.  It makes me think back to that smell you'd have to live through in elementary school when a kid would puke in class and they'd cover it with sawdust until the janitor could come.  Then, they'd spray some weird disinfectant that almost smells worse than the vomit.  Together, it's a sickening smell and one that makes everyone want to start barfing all over again (kinda like Chunk's story in Goonies).  Point being, it was a really strong smell and made us want to leave.  And, at the risk of sounding like an old fogey, the music was SOOOOO loud.  It was great music, just too loud to be enjoyable.  Maybe I'm just past the point of wanting to scream to my friends 1 foot away just to have a conversation.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I like the dark decor of the bar and the art on display above the back tables, they make for a shadowy ambiance that a few drinks intensifies.

Silly me. I have since moved back toward the westerly parts of town and have reacquainted myself with Cole Valley, the Haight, the Sunset and the inner Richmond and have found a bevy of worthy joints I carelessly overlooked in my totally clueless early, early twenties. Among those gems is the 540 Club on the bustling and cool Clement Street. \n\nI was introduced to it by my beau when we first started dating a couple of years ago and was immediately taken in by its funky, colorful decor, its chill bartenders, good jukebox and great selection of yummy libations. A former bank, it has a high, embossed ceiling giving the narrow space a sense of openness. It has a front smoking porch and dart boards and wooden bar that has been properly chewed up over years of use. There is always a rotating art show on the walls that features work that is interesting at worst and often truly good. They have DJs regularly who play fun, unobtrusive stuff that's good for dancing or for chatting. The bartenders are totally cool, but not too cool, if you know what I mean. They pour strong drinks, have a great selection of craft and imported beers, including a great bottle selection featuring some of the harder-to-find Belgians. \n\nWARNING: When you go, DO NOT FORGET YOUR I.D.! The doorman is a pit bull about this! You could be 68 and look every year of it, but the doorman will not let you in if you do not have your valid I.D. He will shake your hand, call you by name and still ask you for your I.D. Don't give him shit. He's just doing his job. And as I former bartender, I can tell you how muy importante it is for every single person in the bar to have valid proof of legal age. So, just bring your license and be prepared to show it.", "author": "Sage R."}

I also witnessed the same angry dude yell at some couple for not hearing him mumble about taking their drinks inside.  too bad, because this used to be my favorite neighborhood bar (i have been going there for years.) but, if that's how they treat people, then from now on,  i'll be going elsewhere.  the saturday night door guy is not good for business. somebody needs to get that guy laid.", "author": "dick h."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-02-18", "description": "I have a penchant for bars too cool to name themselves, but prefer to go by their street address instead  - and the 540 definitely qualifies. I love it for the beer. Ohhhhh the beer. Belgian, tasty and reasonably priced (except for the Chimay, but $6 for Chimay is good right?) The art never fails to be interesting, and at times also disturbing, but its never up for long so next time you go it will be replaced with something else. The jukebox never plays my songs, even mid-afternoon. I went in there one time dressed like Santa Claus and made all the girls sit on my lap and tell me what they wanted for Christmas..why does that make this a good bar? Because I didn't get kicked out for it. And trust me, in any other bar I would have. Santa drank way too much jager.  Oh, and $1 cocktails on Monday nights is never a bad idea. Unless its Tuesday morning, but thats what $2 Tuesdays are for. They were also smart enough to install coat hooks under the bar. I love not having to pick my jacket up off the bar floor after a night of good drinking.", "author": "Brenda K."}

Yes, the drinks aren't that good (what can you expect for $1 and cheap liquor), but there is a certain happy atmosphere that is present on Monday nights (again, what can you expect from $1 drinks and liquor).
