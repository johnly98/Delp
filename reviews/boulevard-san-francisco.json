The missing star is due to their failure to recognize the birthday we were celebrating, even though I put several notes in the OpenTable reservation about it (and if Boulevard blames OpenTable for this gaffe I just blame Boulevard, as OpenTable is its chosen reservation platform).\n\nThe service was very good, from the waiter to the busboys refilling water and bread.  Our server was able to describe the dishes in great detail to help us make our selections.  We had two appetizers, the calamari and the beet salad, and both were beautifully plated and tasted great.  Our server totally pitched the scallop entree and we both went that route, and we were not disappointed.  The scallops were accompanied by two fried oysters and beans and mushrooms in a cauliflower puree.  Once again, beautifully plated and tasted great.\n\nThis place is phenomenal but due to price ($140 with tip and no alcohol for two apps and two entrees) it is not an everyday type of lunch place.  However, it is a great option for a business or special celebratory lunch or dinner/date night!", "author": "IYELP U."}

We got seated right away and paired with one of the strangest waitresses I've ever experienced.\n\nThe menu at Boulevard has both starters and mains, but nowhere on the menu does it say you're required to order both. But after the first person placed their order for a starter, the waitress followed that up with, \"And your main?\" My coworker only wanted a starter and seemed a bit confused by the question, so she said she would just stick with the starter for now and consider a main later. The waitress didn't seem pleased.\n\nShe again questioned the next person that only ordered a main but no starter, asking, \"And your starter?\" By this point I could tell we were all confused about whether the expectation here is that you order both a main and starter or if this was just a way to get more money out of us (especially since we weren't ordering alcohol, which the waitress really seemed disapproving of), but ordering rapidly turned awkward. One person asked to keep a menu at the table and the waitress didn't want to let her keep it and said she'd bring one back if we needed it.\n\nCrispy squash blossoms ($17) were ordered for the table. Stuffed with white shrimp and sweet corn and served on top of a green tomato carpaccio with corn relish and lemon aioli, they were lightly crisp and generously filled. The house bread and salted butter was quite good.\n\nI got the roast chicken salad ($23), which was one of the blandest things I've ever eaten. The chicken was either boiled or blanched, not roasted, not seasoned, and reminded me of the plain, boiled chicken breast my uncle fed his dog when she was on a diet. The walnuts also tasted raw, not toasted like the menu claimed. While the apples, beets, and feta all came together nicely in the salad, the lack of any sort of dressing made for a dry, sad meal. I didn't finish it.\n\nThe white peach iced tea was served on ice, but at room temperature, so it was warm for the majority of the meal.\n\nOne of our party members had to leave early but he secretly paid the check as a gift to my coworker celebrating her birthday. We didn't know this when the busboy was clearing our plates and asked if we wanted dessert; we said no thank you, just the check, so he flagged down our waitress and asked her for it. The birthday girl went to the bathroom, and the waitress came back with dessert menus asking who was celebrating the birthday. We said we didn't want dessert, just the check, and she said, \"Oh, not even something for the birthday girl?\" Again, we politely declined, and she coldly removed the menus.\n\nBirthday girl comes back and sees we still don't have the check, so she asks our waitress at the hostess desk for it and was told stiffly it had been paid for -- and that our coworker had wanted us all to order dessert.\n\nWhy in the world the waitress didn't just say that to me and my coworker while the birthday girl was in the bathroom, I have no idea, but had we known our other coworker had intended for us all to celebrate with dessert we would've taken him up on his generous offer. The birthday girl came back and was awkwardly delivered a complimentary birthday bon bon by the waitress, which was very nice, but at this point the entire meal just felt like a total bust.\n\nI have no desire to return here.", "author": "Angela M."}

I made reservations around a week prior because of last minute change of plans. We were lucky and was able to get a reservation at 7:15 on a Thursday night. \n\nWe decided to drive there since it was a school night for both of us. They have valet, but it looked pretty pricey so we were lucky to find a different parking spot down the block, around the corner. When we arrived, they were setting up our table so we grabbed drinks at the bar. I really enjoyed my drink. It was fruity and not too sweet, I wish I could remember its name. Drinks cost about $16 each...which is expected in sf. \n\nWe were seated at this cute little oval table where we were able to sit side by side. Then they immediately wished my boyfriend a happy birthday and handed him a card. We decided to order the tuna appetizer. It was our FAVORITE! We loved the bread that came with it and the flavors were delicious. Boyfriend ordered the pork prime rib and I ordered the lamb. These were the two suggestions that the waiter gave us after I asked him what he would recommend. I personally liked the lamb more than my boyfriend's dish. \n\nAt the end of our meal, they surprised my boyfriend with a small birthday chocolate cannoli dessert. Overall, this place was a nice place to eat a fancy dinner or to go to for a special occasion.", "author": "Heather I."}

The restaurant feels a little formal (white tablecloths) and it's frequented by the expense account crowd. I've had many good meals here when I worked in the financial district and I was happy to return here for Friday dinner as I was working through the SF top 100 list. \n\nI started with the Spanish Octopus as my appetizer. The octopus was cooked perfectly and came with black rice and smoked ham hock.  This was a great way to start a meal.  My entree was the lamb T-bone (wood oven roasted, medium rare and served off the bone).  This was just excellent!!!  A Virgin mojito was the ideal non-alcoholic pairing for this meal.  The bread service was good.  \n\nI ordered the baked hot chocolate for dessert. It was a warm flourless chocolate cake with caramel popcorn, paprika puffed sorghum, toasted Spanish peanuts, raspberries and chocolate peanut ice cream.  There's a lot going on here and I think it didn't work. The cake itself was a bit chalky and the caramel popcorn was a bit too sweet.  I'd pass on this one. Mint tea is always good with chocolate and I like the DIY tea kit they use. \n\nService was excellent. With tax and tip, this was about $115 which is about average for SF fine dining these days. Highly recommended particularly for a nice business meal in the financial district.", "author": "Andrew S."}

This restaurant is a classic -- it's been around for decades. I can appreciate that it maintained its classic furniture and decor, and especially loved the red-brick ceilings. \n\nAs for the food, I got the corn soup which was pretty good. I tried some of the ahi tuna tartare which was excellent. Loved the taro chips. As for the main, it took 45 minutes to come out. Added on to the fact we were in the wine cellar (resourceful haha) so we weren't able to check on our food because we were blocked out from the waitstaff. I got the lobster & scallop risotto, which was underwhelming. The scallops were good, but my lobster tasted wet and fishy... and the risotto itself was way too creamy and rich. I was only able to eat half of it, and was drinking water excessively after. I felt like it was a little overboard on how umami it was that it didn't taste natural. \n\nI would give it another shot to try other items on the menu for sure! Perhaps the risotto was not my cup of tea.", "author": "Vickie Z."}

We would dress up and be young and awkward in this fancy restaurant.  It probably took a couple of paychecks to cover our meal, but it was well worth it back then.  \n\nNow that I'm much, much older (but who's counting), going to Boulevard is still great for a special occasion, or just a really, really well executed dinner.  My former boyfriend, now husband, took me here the other day and it was great to see that the place hasn't changed, and yet doesn't look old or stale.  It's still a very nice place for friends and family, or for that power lunch or dinner.\n\nWe sat at the chef's counter which is always exciting to me.  I love watching meals being prepared and the hard work the cooks put into plating everything perfectly.  Our servers worked wonderfully as a team, making sure everything from our utensils to drinks were always in place.  While I loved my duck, my husband's steak was absolutely perfect and I wish I ordered that as well.  The cook who was right across from me joked around about how cool it was being in front of the wood burning oven.  We thanked him for how delicious the meals were.  \n\nIts nice to know Boulevard still provides such a wonderful dining experience after all these years.

I checked my bookmarks and didn't see it bookmarked, so I quickly bookmarked it!\n\nA few weeks back, my dentist, after hearing I graduated from culinary school, felt compelled to tell me his favorite restaurant in the bay area.  He named Boulevard as his favorite.  He's a big-time foodie and loves the fine dining scene, so my ears perked up to hear his opinion.\n\nWow, I thought. I really need to make it to Boulevard soon.  And so we did!\n\nBe forewarned, no valet - street parking can be a challenge depending on what time you go.  Do your nearest garage research in advance.  We didn't.  :(\n\nElegant interior, you'll feel better if you're not wearing a t-shirt.\n\nWhile our table was being prepared, we sat at the bar and my wife asked the bartender if he knew how to make a Whiskey Smash.  He said he could.  She asked for it extra sour and he said if she didn't like it, he would make her a different drink.  Well, it came and it didn't appeal to either one of us.  So he was good enough to replace her drink with something she was happy with.  Happy ending, but coulda been ugly.  :)\n\nPretty simple menu, LOVE simple menus!  We chose the:\n\nHAMACHI CRUDO (4/5)  Elegant, little plate that came to our table with some fresh tasting yellowtail, garnished with shishito peppers, avocado and furikake.  Refreshing and tasty.  Another plate please.\n\nFRIES (5/5)  We read in some of the Yelp reviews about the recommendations for the Truffle Fries.  When we asked about them, the waiter told us that they no longer have them on the menu, but that he could bring us \"regular fries\".  So we got the regular fries and they were not ordinary. They were served piping hot, crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  Perfectly seasoned, perfectly enjoyed.  Order the fries for sure.\n\nOVEN ROASTED DUCK BREAST (5/5)  My wife's dish.  She's a duck lover and I might even say a connoisseur of duck.  She had nothing negative to say about her plate.  Presentation was again, nicely done and all the small garnishes on the plate complimented the duck.\n\nANGUS FILET (5/5) This steak was wood-fired and came perfectly \"medium\" - garnished with very thinly and beautifully sliced King Trumpet mushrooms.  The mushrooms were delicious and there was also a golf-ball sized potato croquette that was pretty tasty too.  The filet wasn't huge, but it was thick and it was the perfect amount for me, given the appetizers, bread and then dessert!\n\nThe desserts were more de-constructed than I prefer, and I'm not sure I remember the exact names of what we ordered, but they were decent.  I like rustic, hearty desserts - not dainty, delicate ones.  These were a bit too pretentious for me - but they looked beautiful.  I'd rather have a fresh-baked brownie with a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  You get the picture.  I might skip the desserts next time we come.\n\nThe service was very good, the atmosphere would be perfect for a special occasion, a birthday, a celebration.  It definitely felt like fine dining.  And you know what?  I discovered my dentist has good taste when it comes to restaurants!  Somehow I knew he did!\n\nI'll have to tell him that at my next check-up in 6 months!", "author": "Darien R."}

We each got their porkchop, which was cooked to a perfect medium. For dessert, we got their chocolate and caramel which was super texturally interesting and perfectly sweet.

She left then returned asking for our order, when asked she recommended the most expensive starters & main courses, (which we did not order, just on principle actually) took our orders, started to walk away I had to stop her to ask if we could order cocktails......her response, \"Oh of course! would you like some water too? This IS NOT the service i am used to at Boulevard, as i feel sure no one else is either.\n  Drinks arrived timely, starter also and dinner as well all brought by the food runners. She wizzed by to check on our meals and over to key in an order, and back for dessert order also delivered by another server, guess she was busy elsewhere. Then that was it, dessert dishes retrieved by a busser and for 23 minutes she wizzed by many times never stopping, the food expediter who i believe was a manger also just looked past us..... we were the last 2 people sitting at the counter, you couldn't miss us!!really quite irritating. I did FINALLY gain her attention after 23 minutes (did I mention this?) to ask for our check, that was delivered promptly, paid with cash & credit card which seemed to throw her off, signed the cc receipt left a 20% tip & left sooooo disgusted & angry on what should have been a fun dinner, turned sour like week old non refrigerated milk.\n    The city of San Francisco has to many restaurants to tolerate this type of service, especially in this price range, if you prefer this type of food i would recommend Absinthe in Hayes Valley, quite DEEEEELISSSH and NOT near as arrogant in the service dept.", "author": "Becky L."}

I am usually not a pork chop type of girl but figured it's their signature dish, so why not (lesson learned:  be adventurous!!)\nOH BOY, it was one of the juiciest pork chop I have ever had. This is the exact description of the dish and it sounds very complicated. \n\n\"Berkshire Kurobuta Pork Prime Rib Chop with wood Oven Roasted Calvados mutsu apple fritto, cold pressed apple miel, poppy seed spaetzle, half moon bay brussel sprouts & edwards virginia bacon. Deviled red kuri squash & roasted sage pork jus\"\n\nMy date got the lamb chop which was also excellent. It's cooked to perfection, chargrilled on the outside and pink on the inside. Since he was eyeing on my lamb chop, I had to offer him a piece even though I would love to hoard the entire pork chop.  He tried a piece and instantly fell in love with it. \n\nFor starters, we got the abalone pasta which was too salty for my liking. Texture of the pasta was great, abalone was well but it's just not for me.", "author": "Cindy H."}

First, Boulevard was located near the water front and has windows pointing out to the Bay, we were impressed with the view.  Now, we knew Boulevard was an upscale restaurant, and even though we were going for lunch,  there were tables filled with people in business attire (maybe having meetings?) and it was quite a sight to see.  I would suggest wearing something close to business casual coming here or else you might stand out a bit!\n\nThe waiter that greeted us at the door immediately off the bat congratulated us on our  anniversary.  The thing is, we only told them about it once while making the reservation so the fact that they remembered and cared shows a lot about their service.  Our waitress was very nice (a little awkward but it was endearing).  We ended up ordering Northern Halibut and the Sea Scallop and Capellini Nero (basically Squid Ink pasta).  This was my first time ever having squid ink past and I highly, highly recommend to EVERYONE to try it once-- it was amazing and honestly, very very worth it.  The halibut was well-made too but didn't make as big of an impression on either of us as the squid ink pasta. \n\nAt the end of our meal, we ordered a dessert (forgot the name, but the picture is attached), and it was quite good and even came with a customized chocolate sign they made.  All in all,  a wonderful experience (although on the pricey end).", "author": "Laura Y."}

This was the perfect choice for a dinner-to-remember. My partner's birthday dinner had to be just right, and Boulevard was a bullseye. \n\nTraffic was a nightmare, so we called ahead and they made us feel very welcome even though  we might be a little late. That was a classy way to help us avoid any anxiety, at least for me, I believe punctuality conveys respect. \n\nSo a fine meal starts out with fine service. From greeting, to seating, to eating, we were treated with the dignified professionalism one would expect at a fine dining house such as Boulevard.\n\nEverything is right there on the daily menu, so there is no memorizing the specials, which complicates the choosing process. You know what I mean. \n\nWe started with a celebratory bottle of true Champagne from their wine list, which set the tone for the evening and made choosing our courses an adventure. Meanwhile, our wait staff decanted the 1996 Cabernet that we had brought from our home collection. The wine service was masterful and, I must say, respectful of the quality of the wine. Corkage; $30.oo.\n\nBefore I get to the courses, I want to share this with you. In our party, we had a 9 year old girl who is no beginner when it comes to fine dining. The staff treated her like she was an adult, which raised the level of our dining experience. I commend that. They even have a nice non-alcoholic drink list that goes far beyond the typical Shirley Temple genre., with selections worthy of the adult crowd, especially if you want to pull off the cocktail \"look\" while still qualifying to be the \"Designated Driver.\"\n\nMay I suggest that you go on line, beforehand, read their menu, so as to avoid hyperventilating. I found myself wanting one of everything, and had to calm myself before ordering. I was too cool to show it, but my excitement was palpable. So, the Fois Gras was heavenly. It came with a small smorgasbord of accompaniments including a grain filled \"granola\" cake was like nothing I had ever had before. I made that one last. By the way, if you're not in the mood for a big meal, the appetizers make for a entree in, and of, themselves. The entrees for our table included, the Filtet, which was rich and cooked to perfect. The Lamb was a home run, and the Halibut was a big hit (it looked great, but I did't get to try it before they polished it off). Everything was masterfully prepared and presented.\n  \nThe desserts were rich and somehow simultaneously light. The mango sorbet was my favorite that night because it didn't overwhelm the meal that was still echoing softly in my mouth. We had a final course of Vintage Port and Tawny Port to round out this perfect experience. I left there thinking, \"Yes, I deserve this.\" (and it wasn't even my birthday!)\n\nCan it be expensive? Well, that's relative, ... but yes.  But, you deserve it!\n\nDining Time: 3 hours+, no rush\nTab for 5 people, well fed, with Tip and Wines and Port: $740", "author": "James G."}

I've never been to a restaurant that did this -- usually it's just a 'happy birthday!' or dessert on the house, which I rather prefer, but it was a very sweet touch to the dining experience.\n\nWe ordered:\nSea Scallop - really delicious and flavorful\nFrutti di Mare Ravioli - not my favorite, a filling was a bit mouth drying\nBerkshire Pork Prime Rib Chop - SO BOMB. It's one of their most popular dishes. Literally saw plates and plates of it coming out at the front kitchen\nLamb T-bone - I'm not sure how I feel about this one. I love the tenderness and flavor of the meat, definitely no gamey taste at all. However, I really didn't like the hummuses it was served with. I tried a bit and I couldn't. I moved the lamb to the side of the dish so it wouldn't touch the hummus.\n\nWish we ordered:\nMaine Lobster & White Chanterelle Risotto - this had been a huge recommendation from our friends but I don't know how I missed this. Would choose this over the ravioli\nAngus Filet - would choose this over the lamb t-bone\n\nDessert:\nButterscotch Pudding - I couldn't stop eating this. I loved loved loved the little truffles, rice crispies, and chocolate marshmallows. \n\nHighlight: As much as this makes me sound like a peasant, the bread and butter was so. ridiculously. delicious. Hory Mory. \n\nService: I've been to restaurants with better service. Our server didn't seem to care much for our table and often looked distracted talking to us.

Salads and other apps are reasonably priced given the portions and ingredients, as are the entrees.

This was the worst dining experience in my recent memory. I chose to celebrate both me and mom's birthday here and deeply regret it. The night started off fine, but I will just fast forward as to why this place deserves zero stars.\n\nFor the main course, we order 2 Kurobuta porkchops and 1 Pacific Corvina Sea Bass. Our server Tim H., misheard us and only brought out 1 porkchop and 1 sea bass, which was fine as we let him know and he placed another order for us. Within 10 minutes, the second pork chop was served. After we cut it open, we realized it was pink and obviously undercooked. We waived Tim down and he took a look at the porkchop and immediately brought it back to the kitchen. He came back and changed our plates and utensils as they have been contaminated. Again, we were understanding about it...mistakes happen. I was hoping he would at the very least address the situation and apologize but NOPE. He continued on without saying a word and pretended as if it did not happen. \n\nJust when you think it could not get worse, it did. He had the audacity to bring the same porkchop we cut open 5 minutes ago after shoving it back in the oven for 5 minutes. We were shocked that a restaurant of this caliber would make such a rookie mistake. We all looked at the porkchop and it was unappetizing to say the least. After 5 minutes, Tim saw that we did not touch our food and asked if he should just take it away. I nodded. Even then, NO APOLOGY. Needless to say we were both upset and disappointed. \n\nI can't help to think that if I was not a young Asian female, the server would have apologized or at least addressed the situation instead of shoving it under the rug. Negative million stars for this. \n\nEven without this fiasco, the food was not amazing nor worth the money to me. There are so many amazing restaurants in San Francisco, I would advise to dine elsewhere. There is a reason they lost their star. Never coming back. EVER.", "author": "Mandi H."}

After doing a little research about it and looking up photos I thought it would be a good place to try. My husband and I meet up with one of his friends that moved out here 2 years ago. I called and made same day reservations. Our reservations were at 8:15 PM and when we got there we were immediately seated. The staff and waiter was nice.\n\nWe started our dinner with appetizers. I ordered the Beet Salad. My husband ordered the Spanish Octopus with Calamari, and his friend ordered the Ahi Tuna. The appetizers were the bomb dot com!! Amazing! My salad was so light and refreshing while so good. It had mixed greens, beets (they seemed pickled), walnuts, blue cheese, and vinaigrette dressing. Everything played well together to create a nice flavor and wonderful salad. My husband's appetizer was very good as well. It was Grilled Octopus and Fried Calamari over a small bed of risotto. It was all cooked and seasoned well. A very nice combination. His friend's dish must have been good as well because he cleaned his plate. Lol. \n\nNext for our entrees. I ordered the Sole set like the Halibut. This means I ordered the Halibut dish but replaced the Halibut with the Sole. It was Sole over a bed of risotto with Asparagus and mushrooms with a fried mushroom on top. It was very good and light. The Sole was cooked perfectly and tender. The fried mushroom was a nice addition. The asparagus was cooked perfectly as well. An overall good dish. My two only suggestions/complaints for this dish is it could have used a tad more seasoning. Also, the risotto was a little more on the runny side. I like my risotto to be a little thicker. My husband and his friend both ordered the Lamb T-Bone. My husband said the lamb was good. I didn't try this so I don't know but I take his word for it. \n\nWe ended our dinner with desserts. I ordered the Carrot Cake and my husband's friend ordered a scoop of their Roasted White Chocolate Ice Cream. The Carrot Cake was very good. Light but still had all the hearty goodness like cream cheese frosting, walnuts to add the perfect crunch, and the cinnamon cake itself. My dish was served with a scoop of the Roasted White Chocolate ice cream as well. The ice cream was very good. My dish also had a carrot crisp on top.\n\nOverall, Boulevard was good and I would recommend them for others to try. I also really loved the portion of their dishes. Not too small but not too big either. I also liked that I could end my dinner with a nice dessert.

The ambiance is very festive during the holidays and the staff working at the restaurant is very friendly and inviting. \n\nWe started the meal with the scallop appetizer and this was my favorite dish of the night. The scallops were slightly crispy on the outside and very moist and soft on the inside. The scallops were topped with prosciutto, which gave the dish a perfectly smoky flavor. The beans beneath the scallops were also very fragrant from the renderings of the prosciutto. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the lamb T-bone, which was cooked medium rare. The portion was small, but filling. It came with a side of roasted white carrots and saut\u00e9ed chard. The T-bone could have had more seasoning, and the medium rare seemed too rare. \n\nThe dessert options were bountiful, but I eventually settled on the butterscotch pudding. It came in a large, ceramic disk, and was covered with crispy, caramel coated cereal clusters, fresh whipped cream, chocolate marshmallow toppings, and chocolate truffles. Also, it was generously drizzled with salted caramel sauce. It was very good at first bite, with the crunch of the crispy rice, the sweet caramel and the soft pudding as well as the bitter truffle. There were many textures in one bite, but after one or two bites, it became too sweet. I recommend the pudding, but it should definitely be shared. \n\nWhen I came last time, I ordered the bon bon and these were delicious!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-12-02", "description": "What happened to their single but still prestigious Michelin Star that they've held onto every year since the Guide started to rate restaurants in the US circa 2005?  It vanished in the 2016 listing, but my second time dining here was just as good as the first a few years ago.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nThe bar area is simply gorgeous with its concave brick ceilings, wood moldings, and mosaic & wood floors.  The middle part of the restaurant boasts marble floors and counter seating with a view of the bustling kitchen.  The rear part where we sat had plain old carpet but an enviable view of the Bay Bridge which was totally lit up and twinkling.  Add in the Christmas decorations, and the place looked like a true winter wonderland.   \n\nMENU:\nIt changes daily, but we had selections of seafood apps, foie gras, soup, salads, fish, quail, lamb & pork chops, filet, and dessert.\n\nFOOD:\nHouse Bread - Soft and fluffy squaw with butter and sprinkled rock salt.  Good but don't fill up on bread alone!\n\nBuratta, Coraline Endive & Dragon Arugula - A tickle for your stomach.  Subtle yet good flavors from the creamy buratta, crisp corona beans and black tahini (sesame seed) paste.  The arugula and endive acted as garnishments.  \n\nLittle Gem Lettuce, Green Goddess & Avocado - A caesar-like salad, albeit a mini one.  The lettuce is similar to romaine, just smaller.  The dressing is clear as opposed to creamy white.  Good, but I'd pass and stick to the seafood apps!  The bite of scallop I had off a friend's plate was just divine.\n\nLamb T-Bone - Holy tiny, Batman!?  3 medium-sized chunks were served off the bone, medium rare as suggested, but had a very odd, smoky/charred flavor, somewhat metallic even, but not gamey.  Weird.  The side of creamed parsley leaf was delish, as were the caramelized chestnuts, and wilted endive.  I didn't read the description well and just saw \"wild rice\" which actually was \"wild rice lamb jus\", that looked and tasted like a minuscule teaspoon of mashed potatoes.  I should've gone with the Kurabuta Pork Chop which I thoroughly enjoyed years ago, but I wanted to explore.\n\nBrent Wolfe \"King\" Quail - Now this was tasty!  The quail \"wings\" were perfectly pan roasted and seasoned, with slightly crispy skin and juicy meat.  The buttered nettles combined with saut\u00e9ed Napa cabbage were a great veggie accompaniment.  A puddle of mustard crema, slightly sweet and savory, balanced out the flavors.  Highly recommended!\n\nItalian White Truffles - This was their special of the night, and special it was!  Their al dente house-made pasta which is a little thicker than angel hair, was laced in a creamy, buttery sauce, and topped with shaved parmesan and fresh truffles.  Me, the truffle oil hater, LOVED the fresh slices!  Orally orgasmic at 3 grams for $39, or 5 grams for $69.  Tiny, tasty, to-die-for!\n\nDESSERT:\nChocolate Cream Puff Sundae - Traditional puffs with scoops of pumpkin ice cream in the middle.  The chocolate puffs were good though I'm not a fan of them in general.  Now the ice cream, that was my fave.  Talk about spot-on taste!\n\nMandarin Orange Vanilla Swirl - A lonely scoop of creamsicle-flavored sorbet was sprinkled in sugar crystals and cookie crumbs with a biscotti-like cookie to the side.  Very refreshing.\n\nSERVICE:\nBartender service was absolutely professional and friendly.  The male server was professional and informative.  Waters were constantly filled and vacated seat napkins re-folded.\n\nTIP:\nSome restaurants in San Francisco add on a service charge that supports the city's employer mandates, which is a shared pot of money used for healthcare costs.  Good idea if you ask me.  Here, they add on 5% for \"SF Employer Mandates\" & \"Healthy SF\".  \n\nOVERALL:\nBeautiful ambiance, nice food presentation, great food.  A favorite of ours.  4.5 stars and still a one Michelin Star in my opinion!", "author": "Vince N."}

The appetizers (the ahi tuna tartare with various inventive crispy side notes and the wonderfully put together figs beets and Gorgonzola cheese) were welcome rifs on old friends. \n\nWe felt like honored guests as we dug into the multi flavored Halibut, Salmon and duck.

Janelle offered knowledgable and refined service and Eric helped my husband whittle down the 4 Pinot Noirs he'd researched online before coming, by offering more in-depth descriptions of each. \n\nFoie gras, burrata, the pork chop and lamb t-bone: yummy and special.

We were unable to get a suitable reservation for Tuesday night, as they were booked until 9:30. When we called on Tuesday they said they only had openings at 5:30 and 8:45, but we checked again the next morning online, and 8 pm had freed up, so we took that reservation. \n\nThe restaurant was absolutely beautiful, even more so because it was decorated for the holidays. There really was a very charming ambiance that's hard to capture with words; I just know I loved being there. When we arrived, it took them a few minutes to seat us because they were so packed. We were seated right behind the hostess podium; I would have loved to have gone farther into the restaurant to see more of the decor, but it wasn't too bad where we were. The restaurant was actually quite large and appeared to go really far back, even though it was completely packed. I really had to scoot in since there was so little space between our table and the tables around us. Since the restaurant was so popular it was really, really loud-- it was hard to carry on a conversation.\n\nFor an appetizer, we got the burrata cheese, which was really tasty. I ordered the steak, while all 3 of my coworkers got the halibut, which they described as melt-in-your-mouth, almost like butter. My steak was tasty and done just as medium rare as I wanted. The potatoes that came with it were so, so good and flavorful; I honestly liked them even better than the steak. We also got a bottle of red wine to share; the server was able to help us pick one from the frankly overwhelming wine list.\n\nI didn't pay so I don't know the exact cost of the meal, but my steak was about $50 and the halibuts were about $30-something each. My boss, when paying for the next night's meal at an upscale Italian restaurant, joked that our Boulevard meal was about double the price (although we only got 2 glasses of wine at the Italian place, rather than a whole bottle, which would have contributed to the price). Overall, I'm glad I got to try such a well-reviewed and beautiful restaurant, but the price, crowding, and noise level knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars for me.", "author": "Connie L."}

This was one of the few places in SF I had been intending to get to for years, I had only heard good things, and had never gone to for whatever reason and it certainly did not disappoint.  Service was great, laid back but at the same time the second you need something they were right there.  \n\nOur waiter had fantastic recommendations for wine and also did a great job of explaining how the filet mignon would normally be cooked so my pregnant wife could order accordingly so it wouldn't be undercooked yet also so it wasn't completely destroyed by overcooking such a great piece of meat.  \n\nI was also surprised that the pork chop that I ordered would normally be cooked medium-rare with significant pink which is not how I typically like my pork, so by telling me that and having a conversation about it I knew that medium-well for me would be the right order and both came cooked perfectly.  A great example of wait staff working with the customer and the cooks applying that information in perfect harmony you just don't always see.\n\nBoth the filet and pork chop were amazing, the sauces were certainly present and very tasty but also subtle and not overwhelming the meats which should of course be the stars of the show and the sides were excellent.  The peach pie/crumble dessert was also fantastic.  The lobster/shrimp ravioli appetizer with truffle was good but a bit of an afterthought after the main courses I have to say more because the latter were that good.  \n\nLong story short, I would highly recommend Boulevard, and fortunately it is not an impossible reservation to get and I would say that the quality significantly exceeds the typical price point in SF for what you get.", "author": "Joshua D."}

We had reservations and it took us 30 minutes to get seated, only to get a table right next to the door facing, not the Bay Bridge, but the street parking lot. \n\nFood - Some plates were great, others were decent. I hate to be blunt, but I can see why this restaurant no longer has a Michelin star. All in all, the food was good considering the price per plate is not that expensive (Ranging from $20 - $40 per plate).\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nAppetizers -- \nDungeness crab - Light and refreshing taste. (4/5)\nFoie gras - Probably the best foie gras I've had. (5/5)\n\nEntrees -- \nLamb - For \"the best\" entree on the menu, I was disappointed. Not too memorable.

The waitress was extremely kind and professional; she was experienced with the ins and outs of the menu. She had no problem answering any questions we had and always stopped by politely and with a smile. For starters, we ordered the Maryland Soft Shell Crab and that was one of the best crabs I've ever tasted. The mix of sour of the lemon, crunch of the celery, and the softness and crispy of the crab was perfect! I ordered the Lamb T-Bone for my main. The lamb was extremely tender and cooked perfectly. Added on with the ceci bean hummus and artichokes, it definitely was pleasant to the taste. For desert, we ordered the raspberry  bon bon which was the \"cherry-on-top\" to the dinner. A hard white chocolate and sweet cold ice cream played off to the savory tastes we had prior. The portion sizes were perfect, I walked out extremely satisfied but not overly full.

I do have to say that comparably for the price, there may be better restaurants out there - but Boulevard is definitely a great spot for a celebratory dinner. The ambiance is lively, there's great energy and noise but you definitely feel like you can sit and chat for quite some time without feeling rushed. Service is impeccable and our waiter was lovely. I had let the restaurant know ahead of time that it was a going away dinner and the waiter knew exactly what to do, was super helpful such a charming gentleman. The food is delicious but in terms of wow factor, I don't think I was blown away by the dishes and flavors, it felt safe and solid so no complaints, but if you're looking for the extra oomph, I might suggest some other also high quality restaurants in the bay area. \n\nDrinks: We tried some of their specialties like the hibiscus moscow mule, cucumber gimlet and dolores swizzle - all great choices and provided an excellent atmosphere to start off and went fine with all our orders. \n\nAppetizers: We ordered the sea scallops, as well as the sweet white corn and dungeness crab ravioli for our starters. The scallops were delicious and very flavorful - highly recommend. The ravioli was delicious as well, but smaller in portion than what I expected.\n\nEntrees: Halibut with fingerling potatoes, brussel sprouts and lobster mushrooms. This was wonderfully cooked and seasoned but again nothing that will blow your palette away. The Lamb T-Bone was delicious medium rare with eggplant stuffed burrata. tomato and basil (I really enjoyed the stuffed eggplant!) and lastly one of my friends ordered something that was like a pasta dish with truffle and I really cannot remember what it was called, so sorry! Again, everything was tasty, but just didn't blow us away. \n\nDesserts: We got the strawberry icecream bonbon which was really yummy! I don't normally like strawberry ice cream, but it was matched so well with the white chocolate hard shell covering it made for a such a scrumptious bite. We also ordered the peach and vanilla tart and it made for a wonderful closer. It wasn't too sweet and topped off the night just right.\n\nOverall, great experience, atmosphere, friendly staff - did i mention views of the bay bridge? location is great if you want to walk around along the water, and even stop by the ferry building area after I would say that it's definitely a worthwhile place to visit but set your expectations accordingly! \n\n~chow!", "author": "Deanna S."}

Otherwise, this place was nothing short of perfection.\nMy best friend and I came to San Francisco on a mission. To eat good, and have fun. We wanted to at least go out and have one 'boujee' night on our trip and after looking at several Michelin Star Chef restaurants, we decided on making reservations at Boulevard and we were certainly not disappointed!\nTo start things off, Boulevard has fantastic customer service and such a unique vibe to it. It's a very relaxed yet high end restaurant with beautiful floor tiles and intimate lighting. They also have coat service and bar service while you wait.\nWhen my friend and I were seated we were immediately tended to by our waitress who took our drink orders. My best friend was pregnant, so my friend notified our waitress and our waitress made sure all of my friend's food was thoroughly cooked, and even so the food was amazing.\nWe ordered the Scallops for the appetizer, and even though they were fully cooked, they had such a buttery melt in your mouth taste! It was perfectly seasoned, we just had to make every bite worth it. For our entrees I got the medium rare Lamb T Bone, and my friend got the Halibut. The Halibut came with this phenomenal cream sauce. That sauce was no joke. I need a lifetime supply of it so I can smother everything in it the way people obsess Nutella with desserts! And the Lamb T Bone? Don't get me started. My stomach still growls over it. I cleaned the plate! I vacuum sucked that food straight to my stomach. (Just kidding I actually tried really hard to not eat so fast because I wanted to savor every moment)! It was cooked to perfection. You can still see lots of pink which I love, the seasoning was amazing and everything just blended so well. There was a perfect amount of savory to sweet and some starch from the Yukon and some crunch from the veggies. I would have to say that was one of the best plates I've ever eaten. I actually even helped my friend eat all of her food because I couldn't get enough of it!\nFinally we knew that no matter how full we were, we had to get dessert! We ordered the Peaches and Cream sundae to share which was incredible. Layers of fresh peaches, storm fruit, bruleed Toffee and cake bites. It sounds overly sweet but the tart from the fruits really brought it together. \nAlso I must add that one of the staff members that was cleaning our tables I believe his name was Josef and he said he was from Mexico was super awesome. He was extremely friendly and attentive. He had many customers to work with but still managed to make each one feel special and that is a difficult feature to uphold. \nOverall, Boulevard wasn't just that one crazy night that my friend and I said \"TREAT YO SELF\". It was actually very memorable and I think all of the staff had very high standards to make it that way for each and every customer and I applaud that. San Francisco really wasn't my personality, but I would definitely come back just to eat here. Definitely one of the highlights of my trip!", "author": "Violet H."}

My first impression when walking in was how BEAUTIFUL this restaurant is. It reminded me of some of the Gaudi buildings in Barcelona. It was dim and very romantic with bowtied waiters and well-dressed patrons. I am used to nice restaurants in SF being full of people in jeans but here, everyone was in cocktail dresses and many men were in suits. A felt underdressed in a collared shirt and a pair of grey chinos. I will say that I was wearing heels and the floor, especially next to the kitchen and bathroom, was a bit slippery and I was worried about my heels getting stuck in the tiling so just a warning.\n\nAnyways, we were sat for our reservation at a two-top with a great view of the kitchen and were given our menus and the wine list. The wine list at Boulevard was extensive and, to celebrate, we ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir (it may have been the cheapest on the menu but shhhh). We were brought bread which was delicious and crusty and proceeded to order our meal. We ate:\n\n-Chilled Dungeness Crab ($21)-We shared this appetizer and I loved it. It was light and had a nice tang. It was a good size to share and primed us for our main courses. A wasn't necessarily a fan of the grapefruit in the dish but I definitely think it is worth ordering. It didn't pair well with the wine we ordered but, of course, that's on us and not Boulevard.\n\n-Quail ($39)-This was my main and it was delicious and served beautifully. The flavors went well together and it was perfectly comforting on a cold, SF night. It was savory with a touch of sweetness and was perfect. The Quail was cooked really well and I was quite happy.\n\n-Kurobuta Pork Chop ($39) - This was A's main and it was HUGE. Easily double the size of mine but he had no issue polishing it off. This was delicious and I couldn't stop sneaking bites. The meat was cooked well and the flavors were cozy. A was very happy with his choice as well.\n\nSince we were celebrating, we also ordered dessert even though we didn't *really* need it. We had the Chocolate Silk Cream Pie ($12) which was FANTASTIC. Whoever is the pastry chef at Boulevard deserves Kudos for this delicious dessert. It was rich but the texture was airy. We devoured it in 2 minutes and, if the environment were less fancy, I think we would have wanted to lick the plate. \n\nIn addition to the wonderful food at Boulevard, the service was great. A lot of nice restaurants have stuffy service but we felt like the service here was friendly and unobtrusive. Our water glasses never were empty and we received a second serving of bread without asking. I think it's a quality of a nice restaurant to have great service where the wait staff reads your mind on what you need.\n\nThe final bill was pretty reasonable for the restaurant of this calibre considering we had 3 courses and a bottle of wine. Obviously we would never come here for a random meal (too expensive for that) but both of us would love to come back, especially since their menu changes regularly. I don't know why this place lost its Michelin star considering it was a better experience, to me, than other 1-starred restaurants but rest assured, a meal here is a real treat and if you get the chance, it's worth the visit.", "author": "Carrie W."}

Its a large, loud restaurant located at the end of Mission St at the Embarcadero.  Like Prospect, Boulevard seems geared toward meat lovers, especially pork chops!  Nancy Oakes (the chef-owner) once published this amazing vanilla brine for cooking pork chops at home.\n\nWe started with the Spanish octopus with squid-ink tortellini filled with potatoes.  Octopus was cooked really tender and seasoned well - just wished there was more of it!  Tortellini had an interesting briny taste but otherwise very good. 4 stars.\n\nThe pork chop didn't disappoint - a Kurobuta thats incredibly juicy and flavored with pickled cherries.  The other surprise is the use of candied popcorn!  It was mixed in with the corn as a garnish and the mashed up with cheese and polenta and then fried.  Its maybe a tad behind Prospect's pork chop but this dish is still a top-tier version.  5 stars.  (TIP: Pair with a glass of pinot noir, since the cherry-flavors of the wine goes well)\n\nI was slightly disappointed with the King Salmon. Cooked medium rare and seasoned well, but it just lacked the wow factor.  Add a few asparagus spears, a pea mash, and some shaved truffles and its a pricy dish at about $40.  I should have had the lamb or beef dish. 3 stars.\n\nThe Blackberry and White Chocolate dessert was amazing, due to the many elements.  Coconut foam, Black Sesame Ice Cream, and this interesting cake of white chocolate and matcha.  Then, some real sweet blackberries.  This dessert goes well with their house coffee.  5 stars.\n\nBoulevard remains a classic SF place that's really good with pork!  Service was friendly but the kitchen tended to be a little slow after apps came out.  Overall 4 stars.", "author": "Daniel C."}

They appropriately lost their Michelin star rating in 2016. \n\nI ordered an unmemorable kale chopped salad, a slightly dry king salmon, and a tasty Milky Way bombe for dessert (visualize an edible chocolate bath bomb)\n\nService was slow, inattentive and akin to being served by a tortoise; definitely not up to par for a   $$$$ dining establishment. Our server stopped by to introduce himself and to get our drink orders, and it was just downhill after that. Dinner dragged out due to the scattered service. We had to flag our server down a few times to remind him to bring our water and bread.\n\nThere's too many other great dining options in SF so save your hard earned dough and go someplace else. I definitely would NOT recommend this place.", "author": "shatier x."}

It still took a while to get a table. While we waited around the bar, I did some people-watching. The dining area was dimly lit and intricately decorated in somewhat of a French-Louisiana style. Even though we were only a couple of minutes late, we weren't seated until about half an hour later. When we finally sat down, we were definitely ready to eat.\n\nAngus Filet - w/ sauteed spinach, mashed potatoes & corn, red peppers, & roasted beef jus:\nThe filet mignon was excellently cooked to a nice medium rare, a little pink on the inside and quite juicy. It seemed a little on the small side. The accoutrements were also tasty.\n\nKurobuta Pork Chop - apple fritto, apple miel poppy seed spaetzle, brussel sprouts, bacon, squash & roasted sage pork jus:\nPretty good chop, I'd say. There was a lot going on with the sides, but the flavors seemed a little lost, with the exception of the double smoked bacon, of course. Perhaps I'm not a fan of spaetzle.\n\nDreams Never End Bon Bon - rye whiskey & pear ice cream, almonds & cocoa nib:\nThis dessert was overflowing with sweetness. Mr. Joy enjoys liquor-flavored sweets, but I find them to be too much for liking. The whiskey-flavored mousse was especially strong. The bon bons were the best part for me, because they resembled little bite-sized truffles.\n\nThe meal ended with a birthday surprise dessert, so we definitely had our fill of sweets. It was a candle in what looked like a serving of semifreddo, accompanied with rolled-up crepe cookies, and a white chocolate rectangle, piped with \"Happy Birthday!\" It was cool and refreshing compared to the cloyingly sweet previous dessert.\n\nService was excellent. Our server was very friendly, sweet, and chatty, albeit at times, a little too chatty. We left feeling full from the food and full of knowledge about the waitress's life story. \nOverall, the meal was great. The filet and pork chop were delicious, but I wasn't a big fan of our desserts. Compared to the plethora of dining options around, I didn't find the menu selections very unique or exciting, but that's not exactly an issue since they serve mostly classic dishes.", "author": "Joy W."}

I didn't know anything about it, we were really lucky to get dinner reservations...this is a place to make advanced reservations. The food is phenomenal! Our waiter knew absolutely everything about the menu and the wine list. \n\nOur daughter goes to SFSU, and we made reservations to eat here a second time and it didn't disappoint. Pricey, but you get what you pay for!! Costumers for life. \n\nTry the pork chop! My daughter got it the first time there, it was so good that she was extremely stingy on sharing a bite, I got a nibble. The second time there, I got the chop and it was to die for!!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-13", "description": "If everything happens for a reason: Boulevard is $$$$ for a reason, and I like to think of myself as a food critic (wannabe) who ended up dining here for a a reason :3 Anyways, regardless of whether or not I have a good reason to spend time writing a lengthy review, here it goes:\n\n1. Bread & butter | Mmm so simple yet so good. The rustic crusty bread boasted an incredibly fluffy interior, reminiscent of Josey Baker perfection. It was well complemented by the creamy butter with coarse salt flakes. Salted butter on bread is not the most haute fine dining, but it was flawless take on a universal staple that opened up the meal nicely.\n\n2. Salad | Curiously, there was no assortment of toppings, and the salad relied almost entirely on leaves. Composed of finely chopped kale, palatable butter lettuce, an assortment of other earthy and bitter leaves, and some ribbons of sweet onion, this was an artisan salad with much thought put into it. The quality was fresh and crisp, the variety of ingredients was original, and the textures were tantalizingly diverse from the frise\u00e9 to the wilted kale, all dressed in a sharp, tangy vinaigrette. \n\n3. Wagyu steak | The quality was superb, as you would expect for wagyu. I like how the cooking style was minimalist on butter and seasoning, bringing to focus to the beef itself. The minimal use of butter foregoes the outer crisp, but as a result it was a more sophisticated cut: tender yet lean, flavorful and mildly juicy. There was also a smear of avocado (which made a delicious sauce) and a sprinkle of broccoli floret bits (which seemed really random to me).\n\n4. Sides | My favorite side was the mashed potatoes. Instead of the typical creamy, buttery (and almost semi-synthetic) mashed potatoes at most restaurants, Boulevard employed creative ingredients in a memorable homestyle version. Big chunks of potato evidenced in-house mashing from scratch, superimposed with an unexpected crisp from thin radish slices. Additionally, there was a side of purple potatoes but in the dim lighting it looked burnt (I didn't realize it was purple until I opened my box of leftovers at home!); there was also broccolini which was good though a bit oily.\n\n4. Panna cotta | Initially I thought the unwieldy goblet of pink layers looked slightly tacky, but this turned out to be an outstanding dessert. The layers of soft cake, whipped cream, and sliced strawberries mixed with the berry sorbet (in a perfectly spherical form!) blended together in a scrumptious yet elegant rendition of strawberries and cream shortcake. It wasn't too sweet, instead predominantly fruity with a hint of floral. I inhaled my goblet, and it was a very satisfying way to end the meal.\n\n5. Ambiance | It's fancy with intricate details and European design, but I found the atmosphere bordering on too metaphorically stiff--dining her almost felt like stepping into a movie in which I was training to be a proper young lady! I guess that's part of the $$$$ dining experience?? Nonetheless, all the servers were exceptionally polite and professional.\n\nThe verdict: Bouge in all respects. Boulevard is well equipped with an army of well-known chefs, as detailed on their website, and the food obviously will not disappoint. However, whether it is really worth the hefty price tag is questionable, especially given the small portions. I have the impression that guys have a love-hate relationship with Boulevard: they are glad it's a good date night place to impress girls, but deep inside they probably resent how expensive the food is and how small all the plates are. (At least the presentation is stellar, so girls will get well-liked Instagrams)", "author": "Edna C."}

We were charged for a \"refill\" for ice tea that's the only I did not like but maybe it's just the way how these nice restaurants operate.

We went for dinner Friday night, and sad to say we were a bit disappointed. \n\nLet's start off with the positives. The restaurant is gorgeous. The decor is beautiful, and the service was even better. Everyone is very attentive and nice. \n\nWe first ordered the Beet Fris\u00e9e salad which was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. Tasted like any other beet salad I've had at past restaurants. The burrata salad was amazing, and definitely one of the best I have ever had. The flavor profiles were mouth watering. \n\nNext, we both ordered the Porcini mushroom milanese for our entree with ricotta gnocchi. The gnocchi was excellent, but the dish was a flop. Mushrooms were all very saturated, fried and greasy. After two bites, I wanted to be done with the dish.  The menu is a bit deceiving with this entree. It's described as a milanese preparation, so I thought the mushrooms would be lightly breaded, but it was heavily deep fried. And I believe the dish only had 3-4 gnocchi's, so all you were left with were deep fried mushrooms. \n\nLeaving off with a good note, the desserts were excellent. Very unusual, and very good. We tried the dark chocolate & almond and the dark chocolate pudding. Both were delicious. The server was super sweet and brought us complimentary cake pops and candies at the end of the meal, which was a very nice gesture. \n\nUnderwhelming due to the reputation and the main entree. But I'm sure the other dinner entree's are much better.", "author": "Elina D."}

Overall, I expected to be more \"WOW'd\" by the food itself which is why I'm giving this place only 3 stars.\n\nSERVICE--Impeccable and fantastic from beginning to end. We originally had reservations at 6:15p but ended up wrapping up our day early so called to see if they could move us up. They accommodated for us to come at 5:30p with no problems. There was not one moment where we felt ignored in this place between our server, the bread guy and whoever else came by to bring our food and drinks. Definitely Michelin quality service from beginning to end. They knew it was my birthday so had a special birthday card for me at the table and added a Happy Birthday chocolate on our dessert with a candle. \n\nFOOD--The food was cooked well but both my husband and I found it a bit bland. Maybe we've just been spoiled by all the great food in the Bay Area but I really was expecting to be floored because this place has won so many awards. Everything was cooked to perfection but seasonings were a bit too simple for my taste. Best thing we ate were the scallop appetizers but for $25 for two scallops, we definitely won't be coming back. Salmon was very small portion for the hefty price as well. Pork chop was cooked to perfection and very juicy and flavorful but nothing that would get me to return. Best part of the meal was the dark chocolate pudding we had for dessert. It came with a peanut butterfinger stick and chocolate pop rocks which was something I've never seen before. \n\nOverall, the meal was good but unimpressive.

They were both very friendly, and mostly left me to my own devices.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-06-20", "description": "What a beautiful, unique restaurant- old world charm with a modern twist. Brick ceilings a gorgeous bar with red stained glass and an open kitchen to see the magic occur. The service was pleasant; the food was a roller coaster. The \"Mother of Dragons\" drink was incredible. A beautiful concoction of spice, sweet, and the black salted rim added another dimension to this amazing drink. The tuna tartar was beautiful not only in presentation but in flavor. The tuna was top notch and the melon balls added a wonderful element to the protein that kept the taste surprising. The rice cracker and squid ink puff was artistic, imaginative and was a perfect vessel for the Tuna. With such a great start to this meal, I only expected for the roller coaster to continue its climb... but instead experienced a rapid descend. The petrale sole dish was a disaster. The fish was a touch over cooked and because of the lack of sauce or acidity it was incredibly dry. The potato squares that rested on little globs on lemon aioli did not work with the dish. The charred octopus was a cool element. This dish tasted like the Ocean - but not in a good way. Leaving one's palate with an overwhelming flavor of fish and salt. It is safe to say I would never order this dish again, and neither would my dad. Throughout the night I observed that the tables around us were given free chef desserts ( lolly pop bon-bon's and salted carmel candies) however, our table did not receive such complimentary sweets. Apparently, you must to be \"VIP\" to receive this. I don't like restaurants that do this. We are all dinners, therefore we should ALL receive such treatment. It really is insulting that they select tables to receive this treatment, and frankly this place should be embarrassed of such behavior. Since my table simply was not VIP worthy, even after spending over $300 for dinner it is safe to say these dinners will venture to other places who appreciate our business and who treat All their diners with the same courtesy-  because that is excellent customer service and that is how you keep and get new clientele. So as this ride started in the right direction it finished sadly and left one feeling as though they just swallowed their stomach because of the vertical drop.", "author": "Allie P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-19", "description": "I learned about Boulevard from reading articles about the best restaurants in San Francisco, and this restaurant was consistently listed as being one of the best. That is why I did some research and discovered that not only does it have a tantalizing high class French food menu, it also has stunning views of the Bay Bridge as it is located near to the Ferry Building. Once I had learned all this information about Boulevard, I was convinced that this is the restaurant where I wanted to celebrate my 22nd birthday.\n\nAnd I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed. The decor is upscale vintage with romantic lighting -- as soon as I walked in, I felt like a movie star from the 1960s walking into the lobby of some luxurious hotel. We were seated at a comfortable table that had soft couches and plush seats, and we had a direct view of the Bay Bridge, which looked absolutely stunning that night. The only thing that could rival that beauty was the long dress I had donned for my special day (at least, I like to think so!)\n\nOur server was incredibly professional and knowledgeable about the dinner and drinks menu. I wanted some bubbly with my dinner, and he picked out the perfect sparkling wine to go with my meal. The appetizers were really luxurious -- Boulevard likes to use premium ingredients like truffles with their food, I noticed, and we liked one of their truffle appetizers so much that we ended up ordering it again. \n\nI had a seafood dish for my entree which came with a squid ink rice pilaf and a mussel with caviar dripping from it, and it was the best seafood dish I've ever had -- and that is a BOLD statement. For dessert, I ordered a glass of pink moscato and bon bons, and the restaurant was kind enough to decorate the plate for my birthday. \n\nOur meal came out to be just a little over $100 per person, which is reasonably priced considering we shared several appetizers, had our own entrees, and ordered drinks and desserts. Boulevard is as classy as it gets in San Francisco, and this is a special occasion restaurant I would recommend to anyone who wants to feel glamorous and luxurious for an evening.", "author": "Pooja M."}

Both entrees were underwhelming - one was served cold. For mains we ordered the scallop risotto entree and steak sandwich. Each meal cost $28 and $24 respectively. I could have easily made better food at home...that's not something someone should say eating at a restaurant. The scallop risotto just tasted bad. It was also plated and served with a huge streak of risotto climbing the plate almost to the rim...my dining companion and I looked at each other and laughed. Who expedites, sees this on the plate and thinks \"this is ready to be put in-front of a customer\". It would have been more funny if I wasn't paying for this meal. \n\nCommentary made during the meal:\n\"the apps really were better than the entrees\"\n\"with food like this I would never gamble on a dinner here\"\n\"the service is amateurish given the price point\"\n\"why does this place have the reputation it does given the quality of the food.\"\n\nIf there's one thing SF has going for it is that we have a wide selection of decent restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-01", "description": "4 1/2 stars. A few drawbacks, but otherwise excellent. Superb food & service.\n\nStarted with lemonade. I wanted something cold after walking all the way from War Memorial Opera House (on heels!) and their cocktails looked pretty potent. Although I suppose with a full bar they could have mixed me up a drink to order, but having lemonade meant I could get a glass of wine - I am definitely a one drink person.\n\nThe hardest part? Deciding among so many things that looked good! I have not had quail in years and considered that. Helpful waiter described dish. Uh oh. Stuffing mixed with sour cream. I absolutely don't like creamy things with meat. He started to say not really creamy, well, yes, it is sort of creamy. I appreciate the honesty. So got avocado/manchego etc. salad and it was great, a lot of different kinds of greens, greens & cheese all shredded to same size, chunks of avocado and slices of mini kiwi with lots of nuts, I think some other seeds? Great salad.\n\nEntree, do I want duck or lamb? Duck is a favorite but I'd had a duck salad at lunch. OTOH, I've eaten chicken twice in a day, why not duck? Two nice slices of duck breast, morels stuffed with duck sausage, a side of grains with chicken skin, tiny turnips poached in red wine. Loved all of it. Had glass of Syrah. \n\nThey bring bread to table, really good bread, and butter with flaky sea salt. I'm going to have to try that some time on butter because it enhances the flavor. I ate all 3 pieces. They asked if I wanted more but I did not want to get filled up on bread.\n\nService attentive, maybe too attentive - everything is fine, great, you don't have to keep checking! \n\nTime for dessert and MORE tough choices. Damn, everything looked good. Settled on the pineapple because it was so unusual. Pineapple, pecans, rice, caramel, ice cream, all working together like a symphony. Or a ballet?\n\nPortions not huge but sufficient and when food is good it satisfies without needing to be stuffed. I really don't need to walk out of a restaurant feeling like an overstuffed tick.\n\nOK - why not five full stars? \n\nTwo small things. The duck was medium rare which is fine but IMHO duck is better when skin is seared. Duck skin has so much fat underneath, searing skin melts some of it off. As it was, there was a thick layer of fat still present. Also the cake was just a tad dry. Like maybe one stir too many in mixing. Definitely more than edible but short of perfect.\n\nMinor. Still want to go back and try other things, maybe come a bit early had have a drink at the bar. \n\nI have a friend in SF who takes me to dinner on my birthday....", "author": "Carol S."}

Guess where my car was parked? 30 ft. away across the street!!!  Nice racket going there.  \n\nSo I'm going to have to rank this establishment mainly on bang for buck.  This could be a five star easily, as the food is fairly decent, however the bang for buck is absolutely terrible!!  \n\nI thought Beverly Hills was bad, but wow four scallops for your main entr\u00e9e, really???  Our appetizer was bigger than the appetizer however that is due to the deep fried squash. $28 for four scallops???  WOW!!!  Come with your card as this puts Beverly Hills to shame, bang for buck!  Just mind blowing on how small the portions were.\n\nThe chef was kind enough and made two nice plates for our two vegetarian's.  In fact, their plate looked better than my friends scallops.  The Bavette meat dish, was delicious, however very small portions.  I'm not into pretty food that leaves you wanting more.\n\nThey also seem to have an affection to nuts as nuts are in many dish's including the desserts.  The apple crisp was not your traditional Apple Crisp.  It was a mixture of ingredients put together and served as an apple crisp. I added the butterscotch gelato to it and wow, what a let down.  Such a small dessert and the Gelato was a tablespoon rolled up.\n\nD\u00e9cor - 5 stars\nService - 5 stars \nFood quality and taste - 4 stars\nBang for buck - 0 stars\n\nOur lunch for four was $240.00 and this was with no drinks, just water.

We spent $80 on two apps and two entrees - no drinks, no sodas, just water. \n\nPrice: 1 star. I rarely rate on price but feel I need to for this restaurant. I ordered the appetizer salad because it looked appealing and asked to add chicken. One of the entrees had rotisserie chicken so I thought perfect, they can throw some of it on this salad. I was wrong. I spent over $20 on the salad below, and you thought Mixt Greens was expensive!\n\nFood: 2 stars. I ordered the ceviche and the appetizer salad pictured below. The ceviche was solid. I enjoyed the flavors and selected seafood. Then after 40 minutes the salad arrived. The salad was awful. It was small but the dressing was blah and the chicken they added tasted like they took a bag of Tyson freezer chicken strips and thawed them. It tasted and had the texture of plastic. My friend ordered the fig appetizer which he enjoyed and the burger. His burger was fine according to him as were the fries that were finally cooked.\n\nService: 2 stars. I understand computer systems go down. I do not understand though not updating your customers after waiting 20 minutes. We waited over 40 minutes for our food. We watched as the kitchen remembered that they didn't add the french fries to the fryer. We watched as they served the people right ahead of us in orders get served 15 minutes before us.

It is a large restaurant down by the water in the financial district. Very romantic setting and this lighting greets you as you enter and take your seat. The kitchen is open and a bar wraps around it. There is an extensive wine list but not much for craft beer fans. When you come here, know that this is not a cheap meal. My husband ordered the Quail and I went with the Halibut. Quail was a hearty dish, filled with winter crops and harvest flavors. My halibut was seared perfectly and it flaked away with barely any pressure of the fork. It was creamy and light served with a Blueberry Jus with Tarragon. I did not get much blueberry flavor at all though which was disappointing. The portion sizes of both dishes were appropriate to finish in one sitting. This place is meant for you to slowly enjoy a meal and lose track of time. For the price though, it may be best to enjoy a small plate or appetizer here and find a different spot for your main meal.

It was about 7:30-8pm and the place was busy and lively, full of older distinguished couples enjoying their mid week date and sipping on wine. The ambiance is very cozy and warm feeling; it felt like Christmas to me when we walked in.\n\nI was so happy that we were seated at the chef's counter because we got the chance to watch the chef's prepare, cook, and plate the food.

Let's start with what works well. The restaurant has nice ambiance that feels warm and rather spacious for SF. We found the abalone to be unique, tender, and delicious. The sourdough bread is also spot on with great butter. \n\nOkay, now that we got the good stuff out of the way let's go deeper. The service is okay although the food itself comes out very slow. Food arrived warm, not hot like one might expect. My special person ordered the duck, but she thought it wasn't up to her standards. I had the salmon which was nothing special. I felt bad for her duck situation so I took the duck and gave her the salmon. I don't know why or how, but I was able to eat the duck. Note, I would pay the price shortly thereafter. \n\nAfter pushing through an average dinner my person decided she needed desert. She ordered the brownie with ice cream (after confirming with the waiter it was a hot brownie) and a Bon Bon.  The brownie was cold and just okay. The Bon Bon was filled with warm melted mint ice cream, which exploded all over upon biting into it. Upon asking the waiter about the Bon Bon we were informed the chef is still trying to perfect the recipe. Interesting to find a restaurant serving a desert they are still trying to get right. \n\nAnyway, I find myself compelled to give this place two stars because of the ambiance and the abalone and bread were satisfying.  If I were to come back it would be for happy hour. Too many options for a great dinner in this city.", "author": "David L."}

I ordered the lobster bisque and the grilled wild king salmon. The lobster bisque was very good, but the portion was rather small. The grilled salmon tasted a bit fishy to me. I probably should have sent it back and gotten the halibut, which my friend liked a lot. The  mushrooms, broccoli \"romanesque,\" leeks, and wild rice that accompanied my salmon were all mixed together, and though the overall taste was OK, it was hard to distinguish one component from another. The  total amount of these accompaniments amounted to a few tablespoons. I wonder what was \"romanesque\" about the broccoli. The three tiny broccoli florets tasted no different from slightly undercooked steamed broccoli.\n\nMy dessert, the flourless chocolate cake, was good. The two small scoops of malted nougat turtle ice cream were nothing special.\n\nWith tax, tip, and the 5% surcharge, the bill for two came to $160.

(1) Everyone around us was presented with an amuse-bouche after they were seated - except us.  We asked the waiter and he replied that it's management's decision in sending out (somewhat appeared to be rolling his eyes as if questioning the management practice).  We were well-dressed and cordial but didn't make the cut.  It's a terrible practice to selectively provide to some and not others, regardless of the reason. (2) My main dish appeared to be about 2 ounces of Salmon surrounded by garnish.  I've never seen such a small piece of salmon as a main dish, ever. The dish was not a main, it was an appetizer.  For $39, I expect a main-sized dish. (3) My wife's main dish looked like it was literally thrown on the plate in a very sloppy manner.  It looked nothing like the other same dishes leaving the kitchen.  Reminded us of the show \"Chopped\" when the host is saying \"1 minute Chefs, better be plating\", and some Chef is saying \"I just need to get this onto a dish\".  I personally don't care about presentation, but it's my wife's dish and she does.  We'd also like to think the Boulevard does too.

It felt a bit cramped for this reason (and that many patrons had very large backpacks). \n\n My friend and I both ordered the same dish, I think it might have been a penne that had a pesto sauce but it was ok. Both came out vegetarian but only mine should have been. It was a while before we could get the waiter's attention.

That was definitely a plus for the restaurant. \n\nAll of the people that worked there were very nice. They offered to take my bag but it took them a while at the end to return it.

I've been here over a dozen times, from business meetings, dates and birthday celebrations.   \n\nOn Christmas eve, two of my best girlfriends and I were here to celebrate my friends birthday.  We ordered several appetizers and entrees and shared each one.    I LOVE that when I go out to dinner with my best girlfriends that we always end up eating family style.  This way we can try as many dishes as possible without breaking the bank.

Very light and refreshing. \n\nBEER BATTERED ARGENTINIAN RED PRAWNS\nSalsa Molcajete, Lemon Aioli \nReview: There were about 5 prawns and there were 3 of us.  \nWe each had 1 and then tried to fight over the 2.

It wasn't on the menu so you may ask your server if they have it. \n\nFor our main entrees, we ordered the following: \n\nGRILLED SWORDFISH\nCalamari Stuffed with Clam & Pancetta Panzanella\nSauteed Spigarello with Artichoke Hearts, Roasted Tomato Relish\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil\nReview:  This was just OK and I will probably not order it again.  My friends felt the same\n\nSEARED HOKKAIDO SEA SCALLOPS\nGolden Beet Risotto, Vacca Bianca Parmesan \nReview:  This was my FAVORITE dish.  I loved the risotto and will return soon for this dish.  Delicious! \n\nBRAISED BERKSHIRE PORK RIB CAP with ROASTED GULF PRAWNS\nSpanish Style Paella with Roasted Tomato, Green Garbanzo Beans & Chorizo\nSmoked Paprika & Pork \nReview:  I seldom eat pork so I didn't try the pork but had the prawns and paella and it was just wonderful. \n\nFor dessert, we ordered the following: \n\nBUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING\nDark Chocolate Bavarian Cream, Pecan Shortbread\nWild Pecan Granola, Vanilla Chantilly \nReview:  I DIDN't want to share this dish.  It was that good.  Definitely try this.  You will LOVE.  Our waitress said this was her favorite dish. \n\nCHOCO-LICIOUS\nBaked Hot Chocolate Cake, Mousse, Wafer\nDark Chocolate Ice Cream & Meringue \nReview: If you like dark chocolate, definitely try this dish.  I wasn't in love with it but it was definitely good! \n\nOur meal was amazing as always and I will return. Fun fact:  Jay-Z and Beyonce also dined here during their 2014 On The Run Tour.  I saw it with my own eyes in a picture on an article somewhere haha.  No really they did, it's even stated on this SF Eater article:  http://sf.eater.com/2014/8/7/6173823/where-beyonce-and-jay-z-ate-during-their-sf-visit  So if you want to dine like hip hop royalty, definitely try it out. \n\nLove and highly recommend this place!", "author": "Christine P."}

I was welcomed with warmth from everyone the moment I stepped into the door to being seated. Unfortunately, things went downhill from there. \n\nSoup of the Day: Lobster Bisque. Came promptly as I was sitting at the counter right next to the soup and salad prep area. Strong lobster stock presence and nice balanced flavors. I was hoping for at a least a small amount of lobster. For 10 bucks, it feels overpriced without any the meat. I wouldn't have mind shelling out a little but more for it. \n\nAlmost 30 minutes later, my Wagyu Burger came. It was a really long wait. I sat across and noticed pretty slow movement from the grill cooks. The house wasn't even full. There shouldn't have been such a long wait. The salad and appetizer cooks were a lot more efficient. \n\nBurger had high quality Wagyu beef and reminds me of Nopa's. Unfortunately the execution was off. Ordered a medium rare and the center was still cold and rare. Not only that, the juices 'sogged' up the lower bun. These two reasons are why Nopa excels better than Boulevard. The soggy bun made a very unpleasant lunch experience, even though I ate with a fork and knife. \n\nFries, $6, were crisp and  good. I like how they presented in a copper sauce Mauviel sauce pan. But for 6 bucks, it is overpriced. \n\nSpecial White Peach Ice Tea, $5.50, just ok. Fresh bits of peaches but lacked flavor and overpriced.\n\nFor a little over 40 bucks, Boulevard is overpriced for the quality. There are much better restos in the area for what you pay. I'll probably give it another try for dinner. Improvements for lunch should start with the grill and oven area. The cooks were slow and technical executions were off. \n\n2.5 Stars.", "author": "Stan L."}

I felt like the first time I was here for my filet mignon, it was absolutely amazing.  It came with a side of corn over mashed potatoes and some grilled peppers which made it even more divine.  The second time around, I ordered the same main course, but the beef came out a little more dry than expected even though I asked for medium rare.  The accompanying sides were also different.  There were 2 fried potatoes.\n\nFinally, foie gras is back so I had to try it!  Unfortunately, it came out more of a jelly substance, and a little undercooked for my liking.  I was expecting a hard slab of foie gras - which I'm use to, but I am okay with skipping it next time.  Sorry.\n\nBut as a starter, I highly recommend the beet salad.  That was delicious.  It has chunks of creamy cheese, beets and some greens.\n\nBe prepared to throw down some dough when you come here - it's great for special occasions and drinks.  Enjoy!", "author": "Julie C."}

In additional to the extensive wine list, they had a good list of cocktails, both alcoholic and nonalcoholic.  My kids were excited that they were having something other than 7-up or Lemonade.  The waitress came soon after we sat down and asked if she could take our drink orders while my kids were still browsing through the menu.  We told her we were not ready yet.  When she came back 15-20 minutes later, she was cold and rude.  We ended up ordering our drinks and dinner at the same time.  Some of the drinks were good, some were tasteless.  My husband and my son both ordered the halibut.  The portion for the halibut was so small.  I don't think it was even 4oz.  When I look at the pictures so people took, I wonder if the split the dish into 2 plates.  My bill still showed I paid for 2 halibut plates.  I will not go back for some time.", "author": "Lisa C."}

Not only a suit and tie kind of vibe, but a boys club kind of old school vibe.\n\nCame here with a co-worker of mine for dinner with reservations and we were seated at the counter. This place was packed on a Monday night and they were turning people away.\n\nWe started off with the softshell crab appetizer. It had a little too much breading for my taste, and my co-worker thought it was just warm and not hot. The crab wasn't soft or that crunchy like a nice softshell crab should be, so we weren't impressed by this dish.\n\nOur next dish was the appetizer homemade truffle raviolis. This dish was tasty with a blend of pine nuts and truffles that made it rich and decedent without being too overbearing.\n\nMy main entree the seabass was too overcooked in my opinion, and didn't have that melt in your mouth tecture. It came with some corn and asparagus which complimented the dish and was cooked well.\n\nMy co-worker who had the lamb said it was cooked medium and tasted great.\n\nDuring our meal we were served this complimentary chip and dip starter, which although I laughed at first (since I thought getting ONE single chip as a complimentary appretizer was supremely funny); I wound up thinking it was the best chip and dip starter I've ever had. Wish it was on the menu so that I could have ordered more.\n\nDuring my meal, and I'm minusing one star for this, the busboy spilled my water all over my suit, and walked away forgetting to get me napkins. And they didn't even offer to dryclean my pants.\n\nYes, I know it's water, but still, I had to clean it up myself without any help since our waitress was nowhere to be found, and the busboy was probably thinking that he didn't want to deal with it, so he left and never came back.\n\nI expected more out of Boulevard and like it's street name, had I known, I would have kept on walking.

I wish there are half stars and I would give them three and a half stars for foods and extra half star for excellent service. Our waiter was very knowledgable about the menu items and knew them well. \n\nWe ordered all of the appetizers on the menu (one of everything) and shared them. They were all delicious! My pallet was a bit overwhelmed by all of those foods. My favorite was the bisque and sea scallops. I had the prime pork chop for my entree, but we shared our plates. I think the pork chop could have been better. The Filet Mignon was a bit too dry and the swordfish was too fishy to my liking (I grow up eating lots of fish, and it is too fishy even for me) The risotto was the best! So creamy and tasty. \n\n\nDeserts were delicious too and pairing with a cup of cappuccino made it even better. The special lemonade was very good. \n\nWe had the private dining room that could have fitted 14 people, and it was very nice as we had our quiet place. All in all, nice place to try a restaurant but I could have gone to a better fine dining restaurant. There are too many of those in sf. \n\nThis review is updated for our second visit for a friends bachelorette party at the same wine cellar private dining room. I downgraded from 4 star to 3 because the food quality was not as good as my first visit. My friends were not very satisfied neither. My friend and I ordered the steak for both medium rare, mine was okay, but my friend's was overcooked to almost well done.

Energies neutralize, balance, settle down, and art begins to form, manifest and erupt. We wound up sharing each selection... the bread was spectacular, although my friend thought the butter, initially presented, was much too hard or frozen. However that soon remedied itself... then seared scallop app; White Truffle Ravioli app; Berkshire Pork Prime Rib Chop and Lamb T-bone main course... chocolate moose, Graham's 20 year old Tawny port and it was a pretty good day so far. Dana and the staff ROCK!  Professional service with excellent tolerance (staff allowed us to switch tables 'mid-stream) through our meal. My friend really knows how to push the envelope when it comes to the 'service' industry folk. I wish it were different, but he's a good egg, from another culture. Anyway, the food, atmosphere, and service at Boulevard appear to be simply what the, this, their, those hearts desire. The wine list is quite special to say the least.

For my first ever Michelin experience, I was completely smashed. \n\nAnd it was awesome. \n\nDrunk fine dining is highly recommended for the following reasons:\n\n1. Be completely underdressed, and don't even give a damn. No tie, no worries. Our server was complete off the charts amazeballs nice. Didn't even bat an eyelash at my jeans or his lack of suit jacket. The service at the place is outstanding which makes sense given its rep. She offered to give us additional small plates so we could share the main courses we ordered. It's a small thing but I know restaurants that charge for this. So cheers to you Boulevard!\n\n2. Drink more while you're already hammered. We ordered more wine at this place. It was a good decision. No further explanation needed.\n\n3. Drunchies: Defined as drunk munchies. And it's so real. But instead of stale chips and salsa, we dined on gourmet quail and lamb chops. At this point, things get a little blurry. But I do remember being amazed that the quail was stuffed with more quail. QUAILCEPTION. And the lamb was like sinking my teeth into a lamb flavored pillow.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and located at a corner. Not much valet but that's all of SF too. \n\nThe food is small in quantity on big dishes just as all rich highly overpriced restaurants do. But thankfully for me that night I wasn't very hungry. There's a lot of wow factors about this restaurant. The view for one side of the restaurant you could see the bridge. The very extra but classy way to go to the restroom via elevator or stairs. The bathroom itself. And some of the food.\nWe had a ravioli mushroom type of appetizer and it literally made me and my boyfriend say wow by the first bite. It was funny cause some person to the left of me did the same reaction to some other dish. Main dishes were good but if that appetizer was bigger in size I'd stick to that.\nI think the best part about this restaurant is that they have this bread crumb scooper that servers use and it's just so useful and a fun additive to a big establishment.\nIt was our One Year Anniversary and our server gave us a little treat for dessert that celebrated that. \n\nAside from the food being obviously overpriced though it's to be expected for any type of 4+ star restaurant, there were two main issues that made me mad about this place. My boyfriend made a week in advance reservation to be a surprise and sit next to the window with the view, the hostess apologized and said she gave us the closes she could and it was a complete joke of a table. We thought maybe it's because they only allow bigger parties to sit there but not we saw an older white couple sit there later on. Maybe they were more \"deserving\" of the table. But then our table was sticking out of the corner of this fence they had. I felt like people would've knocked food over David or just run into him cause that was a main passage way. No food was knocked over, but people were hitting him cause we were sticking out. Maybe I'm thinking to much of this, it's possible.

Our last visit was really disappointing, though. Specifically, our reservation was handled very unprofessionally. Fifteen minutes before our reservation, the restaurant called to ask if we were still coming. We replied that we were on our way and would arrive on time. Then, the hostess called AGAIN five minutes before our reservation, as we were walking in from one block away. Again we told her we'd be on time. But when we walked in (ON TIME and not one second late), it was obvious that our table had been given away! We were forced to wait in a cramped and chaotic space near the bar for nearly 20 minutes. No apology was given. It was my birthday, and I was really disappointed. I politely told the hostess I'd like to check in with a manager after she seated us. I've never had a restaurant call even once, muchless twice, to see if I am still coming, when I am showing up on time! And then to have them give away our table after all the trouble. Crazy. The hostess said she'd have a manager come by, but no one ever showed up. To be fair, our experienced female server was lovely, and the food was of course good, but we had to rush through dinner for our babysitter, and we felt disappointed and offended by how our reservation had been treated. It was terribly inhospitable behavior, in my view, and also really a shame that a manager would not have wanted to check in with rightfully unhappy guests.

Nice seating for a romantic dinner so you can sit close with your beau. \n\nFor appetizers we had the Ahi tuna and the soft shell crab. The Tuna was good and it was new to eat it with grapes and hummus. I could pass on it next time though. The crab however was freakin delicious. It had so much flavor without being too pungent or overwhelming. The whole time I ate it I kept repeating, \"omg this is so good\" because I couldn't get over how good it was!\n\nMy main was the pork chop and I didn't like it. It was gamey and I think I tasted goat cheese. I don't remember if the menu said goat cheese or anything, perhaps I over looked the description. So why the five stars? Their lamb, holy cow- or holy lamb. It was bomb. When I saw it on the menu I thought it sounded delicious, except I hate the gamey taste of lamb so I skipped on it.

The pork chop was the highlight -- really juicy and delicious.  The chocolate desserts, again, were fine.  And for this the bill was slightly over $100 per person before tip, and not including wine as we brought our own.\n\nSo there you go.  It's sort of an elegant steak house vibe.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-06-29", "description": "I tried Boulevard for lunch on a weekday. Overall I was fairly impressed but not blown away.\n\nI started off with the ahi tuna tartare. It was served with macadamia nuts, dried pineapple, and hearts of palm. Though I am a big fan of tuna tartare in general, this dish left me barbell markedly disappointed. The tuna was very fresh but the flavor missed the mark. The nuts distracted from the fish rather than complementing it. The taro chips were not noteworthy, but the nori chips did improve the dish with their flavor. Not quite enough to salvage the dish though.\n\nThe lobster bisque was fairly well done. It was creamy and rich. It was finished with clams, and that worked well with the lobster flavor. Not the best lobster bisque ever by any means but no complaints.\n\nFor my main course, I had the wagyu beef bavette done rare. The meat was cooked beautifully: very tender, juicy, and flavorful. My only issues with this dish were with the secondary ingredients. The potatoes were served in thick slices with Fourme D'Ambert cheese. I'm not a fan of blue cheeses, so I won't hold that against the dish but the potato was pretty boring on its own. I'm being pretty nitpicky and maybe if I liked the cheese the potato would have been better. Still, I do love when I enjoy every part of a dish on its own as well. The radicchio was way too bitter for me to eat at all. The tomato slices were very juicy and flavorful though.\n\nI also tried a bit of the boneless Berkshire ribs and coconut shrimp. The ribs were tender and flavorful; the fish sauce was used very well to create a unique flavor. The coconut shrimp was just sweet enough. The lemongrass rice with sesame seeds, pine nuts, and shallots was delicious both in flavor and texture. The rice was just the perfect amount of crispy.\n\nTo wrap things up, there were some misses here but mostly hits, and the price is very right if you can manage to make it here for lunch.", "author": "Kevin T."}

Hmm, I wouldn't quite say it lived up to my expectations, but overall it was still a good experience. \n\nTIP: make reservations.  We made reservations 3 weeks in advance and the only available time closest to 7pm for 2 were 6:15pm or 8:45pm. Crazy huh?\n\nATMOSPHERE (5/5): Classy and old fashioned. I liked how the tables were nicely spaced out, white tablecloths, nice red lighting, romantic, even better if you sit by the big window facing the bay bridge.  We came at 6pm when it was still bright out in the summer, so you couldn't really see it while eating.  But after eating, it's walkable distance to go out and see the bay bridge lights for yourself.  Better view outside anyway.\n\nSERVICE (4/5): Nice, polite, knew the menu, and did her job well. But, it wasn't anything spectacular.  If i\"m eating at a Michelin star restaurant, I expected the server to be excellent with a BIG smile on her face and extremely friendly to add to our experience.  Service is surprisingly a significant factor to dining out. \n\nFOOD (4/5): Everything was good, nothing was bad.  Average main dish were ~$37.  \n\n*Choices of main dishes consisted of:\n3 seafood: halibut, seabass, salmon\n1 poultry: quail\n3 red meat: pork prime rib chop, lamb, filet mignon\n\nPork chop was better than the lamb.  Pork chop was so juicy, actually really good (4.5/5) and the lamb was good as well but just not as tender (4/5).  The sides included in the lamb weren't good either, but the pork chop had a sweet polenta that was also delicious.  Definitely get that pork chop for its juiciness meat, though the sauce could be better. \n\n*Appetizers: BRANDADE IN THE SEA SCALLOPS! (4.5/5) That tiny brandade was actually the highlight of my whole meal lol. I had a taste of that and my taste buds and eyes were just enlightened.  I had to ask the server twice what it was.  It was like a soft potato full of flavor, and it tasted even better than the scallops.  I still liked the scallops at Isa better.  Scallops were good, the sauce was good and spicy, and that brandade, knew found discovery, was excellent. \n\nFava Bean & Parmesan Raviolini (3.5/5) were like pot stickers with rich cheese inside.  If you really like cheese, this is the dish for you.  Eddie K loves cheese and said this was the highlight of his whole meal.  For me, I liked all the different ingredients along with the raviolini to make it a dynamic dish, like the mushrooms, squash, and radishes, and the raviolini itself was good too, but I still couldn't get over the fact of how wonderful that brandade tasted.  Wtheck is a brandade anyway?!\n\nDRINKS (3/5):  I'm only rating based on the Moscato D'Asti, which was good, but holy crap that was the most expensive portion ever.  It was in a dessert wine glass and wasn't even filled half way, and that costed $12...that kind of ridiculous.\n\nOVERALL: Nice atmosphere, good service and food. Would I come back?  I'm curious to see how the seafood tastes, but if the highlight of my meal was the size my pinky and was an appetizer rather than a main dish, I think I'd rather go to another Michelin star restaurant.

Execution, sadly, is not one of them. \n\nGenerally the food ranged from decent to great, but a slightly undercooked foie, and a dramatically undercooked quail, put a damper on what should have been an amazing meal. \n\nIf I'm dining solo and dropping 200 plus, I expect perfection. What I got was far from that.", "author": "Sy N."}

Unlike all those trendy restaurants that pop up left and right so fast you can hardly keep up, Boulevard has been around since 1993 and is a staple for fine dining. \n\nI actually had reservations here years ago but ended up staying home and watching tv and thought I wouldn't make it again for dinner because I had a cold but I'm glad I felt well enough to dine here with my boyfriend and his grandma visiting from slo! We were actually just talking about this restaurant when we walked past it on the way to the farmers market and a week later he told me his grandma invited us to dinner there! What are the odds?! \n\nThis restaurant is huge! I feel like I could easily get lost in here because the seating arrangements aren't really in a grid. We ended up getting an awesome table in the corner with a perfect view of the bridge! Well my back was against it but his grandma and her friend had the best view. \n\nI started off with the avo and crab. I wanted the butternut soup but my boyfriend wanted it and for some reason I hate getting the same thing. I want to try as many things as possible! His grandma also got the soup and they pour it over a gruyere custard at the table. I'm looking at the menu while writing this review and holy crap my appetizer was like $20! Most restaurants are prix fixe unlike Boulevard so its crazy seeing everything broken down like that. They have a filet mignon entree for $45!! \n\nEven though I don't like ordering the same things, my boyfriend and I both ended up getting the scallops except I got mine sans bacon. It was so good!! Everything here was solid. I think my boyfriend said he didn't like this place the first time he came for a business dinner but he really enjoyed everything he got this time around. \n\nOh and I also had a glass of their Malbec. I think its quickly becoming my favorite wine because I order it every where! We were COMPLETELY stuffed by the end of our entrees but we still ordered dessert. Yipee!! No dinner is complete without dessert. My boyfriend and I shared the sweet cream cheesecake which I see is no longer on their menu anymore but it was really good! He almost always opposes dessert but then eats like 80% of it!!! \n\nService was pleasant but honestly nothing special! I suppose solid would be the word. Solid solid solid.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Our starters were excellent -- crab salad and the hamachi crudo tostada. \n\nBut the mains were overpriced and artifacts from an earlier generation of food. It's not that they were bad, but food culture has advanced and maybe spoiled my palate. American wagyu burger medium rare, was the order. What came out was a mostly well-done, spongy and somewhat moist, pre-formed (looking frozen, frankly) circle of meat on bread. It wasn't a terrible burger but after having excellent burgers with a blend of freshly ground brisket and chuck, hand-formed and perfectly crumbly... this is disappointing.\n\nAre my expectations too high? I don't think so, given how lauded it was and given it carries a Michelin star. \n\nMy wife had the bavette (hangar steak) with morel mushrooms and it was pretty solid, not blow your mind. But the wagyu burger was really disappointing. \n\nIf you want to take a client to a blast from the past, maybe it's a good power lunch.", "author": "Edward S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-03-10", "description": "It lost a star due to attitude of certain staff.  Get over yourselves, you work in a restaurant, you are not leaders of countries or champions of world peace.  That said, I loved the decor and ambiance.  We went for lunch on a Tuesday, our greeting was formal and stiff.   There were beautiful booths that sat empty but we were led to a two top that was designed more for a cup of tea than a meal.  The \"I'm too old to be sporting the pony tail look\" gentleman that guided us to our table waited impatiently as I tried to get into my chair with coat and purse.  Literally I had to sit side saddle and could not comfortably adjust anything as he waited to give me a menu.  So awkward and so so unnecessary.  Is this your way of making guests, who are helping you to make a living, feel comfortable?\n\nThe gentleman who filled our \"tap water\" was so down to earth and friendly and was the only one to make a very positive impression.  After perusing the very short menu, we were ready to order, but no one came.  The initial server was female, but after an unnecessarily lengthy span of time a male server arrived to take our order.  He was borderline pleasant but not someone we felt at ease with.  When my husband inquired about his opinion of the soup of the day his sole response was \"well it is quite creamy.\"  So here is a server who has a slight attitude issue but he can't even eloquently describe a dish.  I thought either he was inexperienced or he was dumbing things down thinking we could not or would not understand a more comprehensive culinary description.  \n\nThe food arrived and it was time to sample the highly regarded goods.  I had a stuffed Monterey calamari starter that was delicious.  The two small squid pouches hid a crab and artichoke stuffing and was accompanied by a tiny fresh Mediterranean salad with fennel.  I was so impressed with the variety of flavors and textures.  Every bite was more satisfying than the last.  My husband's swordfish was so fresh, tender, and moist.  All in all a superior lunch.  Oh yes and the sour dough bread with a surprise salty crust was perfect.....Airy and dense at the same time with a crackling crust.\n\nIt's time to lose the attitude though folks.  Servers in Paris are more pleasant then your staff.  When we dine at our favorite 5 course restaurant in Washington DC, our servers feel like family as they are so down to earth and engaged.  Your food may be of the highest caliber, but I would not return for a  repeat visit as the pretentious attitude is just too hard to swallow.", "author": "Regina S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-10", "description": "16TH MICHELIN STAR EXPERIENCE: CALIFORNIA FOIE GRAS DELIGHT\n\n\"My First Review of the Year\"\n\nLast year in 2014 was a great year for my family. My cousin who was unemployed for more than two years was hired at Futuris, a company Tesla contracts to, in June. His older brother had his first born son. My nephew earned his GED in December. On Christmas my sister and her husband announced they're expecting their first child. Me? I didn't go to Brazil for the World Cup as I had done for the three previous World Cups: Japan 2002, Germany 2006, and South Africa 2010. However I went to Las Vegas twice for free, but I would have preferred going to Brazil for the World Cup. In terms of Yelp accomplishment I did receive my first Elite status. However I'll take family accomplishments any day over personal achievement. What will 2015 entail? This year is my high school reunion, which I hope to go. As a horse racing fan I would love to go to Louisville, KY to watch the Kentucky Derby live in person. My ultimate goal in 2015 is to get accepted to an MBA program. \n\nSo far 2015 has started great because last Wednesday US District Judge Stephen Wilson decided to strike down the California ban on foie gras as he deemed it unconstitutional. So my first Yelp review of this year is fitting because of the foie gras ban that was lifted. \n\nI decided to eat here because I had foie gras after the ban was implemented. I ate here last night to eat my foie gras legally for the first time after the ban was lifted. The seared foie gras was smaller than the last time I had it. Would the foie gras be as memorable as last time? I ate my first bite of foie gras legally in more than two years. It was heaven in my mouth because it tasted like butter. The analogy statement it tastes like butter fits perfectly with my first taste of foie gras in long time. What helps the buttery texture was the toasted seeded sourdough that was with the foie gras. Those two combinations were like eating butter on toast, but in a luxurious manner. I wanted to savor each bite of the foie gras because I didn't know if I was dreaming. Ok I know it's just duck liver, but it tasted great even more so because foie gras is legal again. To compliment the foie gras I had it with a glass of sauternes. \n\nRegarding the main course I had most of the main courses at Boulevard before like the prime rib pork chop, quail, and lamb t-bone. I was hoping there was filet mignon topped with foie gras butter, which was on the menu before the ban. I decided between the California swordfish or the local petrale sole. My server described the dishes by stating the swordfish is meatier while the local sole is more delicate. I decided the swordfish. I was glad I ordered the swordfish as I overheard from another server that the sole was eventually sold out. The best swordfish I've ever had was at Firenze by Night, an Italian restaurant based on Tuscan cuisine at North Beach, because it reminded me of sliced ham due to the presentation and the texture. From appearance the swordfish at Boulevard was smaller than the one I had at Firenze by Night. However I was worried about the swordfish at Boulevard because my first bite it tasted dry on the outside. I thought I had made mistake and maybe shouldn't ordered the prime rib pork chop, which I had the first time at Boulevard and was the best pork chop I ever had. As I continued to consume the swordfish it was moist in the inside. I tasted broth inside that made the swordfish more delicious. \n\nHow much was I craving for foie gras? I looked at the dessert menu hoping to see if there was a foie gras as a dessert. Since there wasn't any I decided not to get dessert. \n\nThe verdict? When I had foie gras at Boulevard illegally I rated my rating experience as five stars in spite of the foie gras ban. However since eating foie gras legal again in California I have to be objective. It was a very satisfying dinner. The foie gras was delicious and while the swordfish was slightly dry in the outside was juicy inside.\n\nI enjoyed my first foie gras meal after the foie gras ban was lifted. I'm starting off in 2015 in fashion with my foie gras eating adventure.", "author": "Gerald R."}

I ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake, which consist of Chocolate Mousse, toffee ice cream (it was between toffee or vanilla), chocolate stout truffle bar almond nugget and caramel candies.

When i got in the view of the bridge wasnt that great.  But the atmosphere was a fancy place. Got greeted when i walked in. Everyone was dressed and looked nice. Not a simple casual lunch or dinner according the people watch i observed maybe just one person with a polo short sleeve shirt on. \n\nGot seated and then ordered. I got the waygu beef burger and requested med rare and french fries. The burger was 14 bucks and french fries was 6 bucks more. i asked for different selection of fries like garlic or sweet potatoe fries. They only got regular fries and the server said it was good. I doubted her when she said it. \n\nNext they served the bread. The bread wasnt good it was hard and not fluffy. I believe it was sour dough. The butter they served had sea salt so it tasted better. \nMy burger came out and it was delicious on first bite. The meat was pink and medium rare. The meat was juicy and can taste the char grilled flavor. The burger was cheesy and the bun was soft and fluffy. the grilled onion was burnt. I believe its the bslamic vinegar on it. The tomatoe was dark as well.\n\nThe fries was excellent. Like it was very crisp and light and golden brown. The fries was fluffy and not hard or soft. The texture was perfect. Its not the meaty fries it just natural skinny fries without the skin. Doesnt seem like its worth six bucks tho. \n\nI do like the atmosphere and vibe and feels classy and fancy and more of a dress up place. The view is not too great but the service inside makes up for it. I like the location convenient and nearby all the hotels. I will return again and try something new next time.", "author": "Alex T."}

I was extremely disappointed by my experience.\n\nFor a restaurant of this calibre, I had high expectations across the board for food, ambiance, service and overall quality. Ultimately, I felt like what was delivered would have been adequate for an \"average\" restaurant but certainly not a fine dining establishment. Fellow yelpers that talked about having \"the best x\" really had my hopes up high too.\n\nWe each ordered cocktails (Mule and gimlet) and they were good but nothing special. The complimentary bread was delivered swiftly to the table but not warmed and the butter was rock solid. \n\nAppetizer was the scallops which were cooked perfectly but the accompanying garnish was mediocre (I can't even tell you what it was, it was that unmemorable). At $20 for 3, I expect better.\n\nOur entrees were the pork chop and the filet mignon. The pork was tough, unflavored and so disappointing that we just stopped eating it. The filet was cooked to a perfect medium rare but the flavours were unremarkable. And again, the accompanying sides for both dishes were lackluster. \n\nWhile our server was polite, I felt like she was too busy and we were always looking for her. I did appreciate her coming by to sweep the crumbs off the table with a crumb scraper.\n\nOverall, this was not a 5 star restaurant and certainly not worth the huge price tag. $49 for that filet is robbery.

We were seated promptly and had a courteous server.  My wife ordered the duck and I ordered the lamb. Both dishes came out within 20 minutes and we immediately noted that they were not hot, but rather room temperature. We got the attention of our waiter, explained the situation and he immediately sent over the ma\u00eetre de. He apologized and took the plates back to the kitchen.  Twenty minutes later he returned with two hot plates and still very room temperature duck and lamb dishes (our original meals-reheated). We explained that we were very dissatisfied and he offered to start from scratch and get us \"totally new entr\u00e9es in 5-7 minutes\" as he would \"jump the line\" for us. Twenty minutes later, we received our very mediocre \"new\" dishes. The food was okay, but not four star. Upon paying my bill I told the waiter I was very disappointed and regretted walking in the door. He took the two drinks we had ($26) off our $200+ bill and scampered away. No apologies.

After our first choice (Gary Danko), second choice (Foreign Cinema), and third choice (Mason Pacific) were all booked up, we decided on Boulevard since they were the first restaurant that had a 7pm reservation for Saturday night.\n\nAmbiance:\n\nVery classy, like a vintage hotel in Hollywood. While getting ready we weren't planning on dressing up, but were glad that we did once we got there. Dimmed romantic lighting. It was a nice setting for a celebration or romantic dinner. The restaurant also left a happy anniversary card that was signed by their staff on our table. Nice touch. :)\n\nDrink/Food:\n\nCucumber gimlet - Love love love! \n\nScallops - Delicious! But sad our appetizer portion was so small. It was gone too fast, too soon.\n\nPork Chop with Brussel sprouts - Satisfying and yummy. It was good, but I didn't get that \"OMG droolz so good\" reaction I was anticipating.\n\nAngus Filet - Not the best and not worth the money. It lacked a lot of flavor and the mustard seed did not help this meal at all. \n\nWarm Sticky Toffee Pudding - Did not like this and it seemed like false advertising. When we got our dessert we thought at first it might have been a mistake because there were no signs of pudding anywhere. My boyfriend said it was more like a warm granola bar with ice cream on it.\n\nOverall, we were kind of bummed with the food considering the price we paid, especially for our 2 year anniversary. We've been to other really amazing restaurants where we had mouth-watering steaks and desserts for a lot less money.\n\nOh well... we came, we saw, and we won't be coming back.", "author": "Sabrina P."}

The thursday that we went, valet was not available so we were directed to a parking garage nearby. The decor is old-fashioned chic and simple.  The service is excellent.  The bathrooms are a tad of a pain by making you take the stairs or elevator, but it is in a historic building after all.  I ended up drinking 2 of their cocktails, where one of them were the vieux carre. Excellent choices.\n\nOrdered:\n\n1.  Starter: Caviar with fettuccine noodles topped with sturgeon vodka cheese sauce- This was absolutely delicious.  The starter was to die for.  A perfect balance of the richness from the cheese and caviar.  \n2.  Entree: California lamb with pistachios- cooked just right for medium rare.  It wasn't a wow dish but tasty nonetheless.\n3.  Dessert: Warm summer berry crisp- super sour and I barely saw any crisp to this.... and they gave me a tiny scoop of the bourbon ice cream.. It totally didn't balance the flavors out at all! // Italian summer bonbon- peach flavored.. the only thing that was decent and simple.\n\nI would say the most disappointing part of the meal were the desserts.  We tried several, which were the bonbons and berry crisp.  If i were to come back to Boulevard again, I would not order dessert again.  I rather go somewhere else post dinner!!

I had an event to go to at the Hotel Griffon next door, and a friend recommended this restaurant to me for dinner prior to the event.  I went with no expectations, having just skimmed the menu prior to arriving.  \n\nI was very impressed by the ambience, the waiters, and the food.  The cooks were also very friendly.  I sat at the Chef's Table, which I would recommend to anyone who is by themselves or in a small group (2-3 people max).  You get to sit right in front of where the chefs are cooking your meal.  They asked me questions, checked in on how I liked the food, and they were happy to answer my questions about what they liked to cook.  I was by myself, so they were my entertainment. Lucky them! :P\n\nMy waiter was very attentive and stayed nearby at all times.  I only had to wait a few minutes before my clean plate was picked up, and she asked me if I liked the food each time I finished a plate.  She was also able to help me out my gluten intolerance, which the cooks also asked me about as my meal was being prepared.  \n\nThe food - I had the octopus and the lamb, as well as a beet and pomegranate salad and a flourless torte for dessert.  Everything was delicious.  I have never had octopus before, and it was to die for.  The lamb was the best I have ever tasted.  I actually didn't know what was in my salad (they told me, but I wasn't paying attention), and when I found out that it was beets, I was shocked - I normally hate beets.  The torte was really good as well.  Nice flavor and presented so prettily.  Everything was, actually.  Hard to decide how to start eating.

(at least on paper)\n\nMan friend decided to bring me here since we both have been hearing great things about this place on a Tuesday night.\n\nWe were seated right away, towards the front of the restaurant in a corner. Well, their was some kind of cold air blowing near us, which I let go, since I figured the place will fill up soon enough. \n\nStarters:\nAhi Poke Salad: Delicious! Comes with beets and an avocado puree.\nScallops: Probably my favorite dish of the night. Scallops were perfect and buttery.\n\nMains\nQuail with biscuit, yam, chard: The skin was fried in a very odd batter. My boyfriend peeled it off and put it to the side.

The ambiance was not my favorite place to dine in.

I wish restaurants had a stricter policy for dress code.\n\nJeans? Plaid shirts? T-shirt!? These are the times I wish I lived in NYC. \n\n2. We needed some time to explore the wine menu because it definitely was quite extensive. That being said, our server was definitely pushy. It's like he had somewhere to be.  We even had to ask for bread. Sheesh.\n\n3. The hostess knew ahead of time we were their for a special night. I wish they made somewhat more of an effort and sat us near the embarcadero view.\n\nWith that being said, if your their for a birthday, anniversary, etc.. shouldn't dessert be on the house?

WHAT'S THE OCCASION?\"  \n\nThis is always the first thing to come out of anyone's mouth when I tell them that I lunched here.  Funny how Boulevard has always been known as the special occasion spot.  Did you know that you can have lunch at Boulevard for less than lunch at..... Hog Island or Anchor & Hope?  But you would never ask what the special occasion was if I dined at either of these restaurants, correct?  \n\nPerhaps it's because the implied prestige of Boulevard that automatically makes one think that dining here is too steep for their pockets. The reality is that I can share an appetizer and have my own entree for $30.00 including healthy sf tax/sales tax/tip, while I'm paying $40 for a similar order at Hog Island or Anchor & Hope.  \n\nThe lunch menu at Boulevard is quite extensive with items ranging from sandwiches, burgers, seafood, and appetizers.  The great thing about this place is that most of the appetizers & starter salads are priced from $9-13 and the majority of their entrees are under $20.  Last time, I ordered their squid ink pasta with soft shelled crab for $16 and shared an arugula salad for $13.  Both dishes were satisfying and delicious.  Other times, I've enjoyed the beef carpaccio, fresh crab salad, and tuna tartare. Best of all, it's all packaged with their impeccable service. \n\nNext time someone asks you where you want to lunch, don't be shy...say Boulevard!!

With a trip planned to the Bay Area, I put it on my list. The prices were very reasonable during lunch, so it was a (somewhat) guilt-free fine dining experience.\n \nFrom the revolving doors to the brick vaulted ceiling and Art Nouveau Paris Metro signage, every choice in decor seems deliberate and thoughtful. The end result is a dining room that feels spacious but warm, cozy but not cluttered, and formal but not stuffy. The exposed kitchen allows a glimpse into the chefs' prep work, and the only flaw I could find was an oddly situated restroom in the far reaches of the building, and down a set of stairs.\n \nThe service was exceptional. The hostesses were warm, our waiter was perfect, and the meal timing was flawless. We had a table overlooking the hostess stand, and the catty critic in me checked on the hostesses a few times to try to overhear a crackle of snark, a morsel of personal life drama, or a whiff of unprofessionalism. Alas, they gave me nothing.\n \nThe food was delicious as well. To start, we were given a generous basket of sourdough and butter with sprinkled sea salt. Everyone got a lunchtime mocktail, which were served in very tall thin glasses and garnished like their alcoholic doppelgangers. Hubby's pomegranate mocktail had a rim of sugar, and my Arnold Palmer had the color fading combination reminiscent of an icy Caribbean cooler.\n\nWe started with some shared appetizers, and I delighted in a creamy spoonful of lobster bisque. I moved on to crispy soft shell crab, which was paired with fried green tomatoes, a savory remoulade, and an herb mixture. This dish was fantastic! For my main course, I chose the \"paella\", which was deconstructed to a fancy chicken and rice dish. All the flavors were there, the chicken was cooked to absolute perfection, and the only thing I missed was a little socarrat on my rice. But this is getting really picky; my meal was great. I also had a bite of the lamb scallopine, which managed to somehow be both fried and light at the same time. Not one hint of grease there.\n\nMy discerning fellow diners all loved their meals, and one said he's really most interested in restaurants that have a \"wow\" factor. We all firmly agreed that Boulevard has that \"wow\" factor, and I hope our paths cross again.", "author": "Meghan A."}

My experience at that other restaurant was not very good.\n\nBoulevard was amazing from the second I walked through the front door.  I did not have a reservation.  The restaurant was around the corner from where I had a business meeting.  It was a Friday night.  So, not surprising, every table was taken and there was no room for me.  The bar area was packed.  But, to my luck, a table in the bar area just opened, which I was seated at once I agreed to sit there.  The hostess was really nice.  Frankly, I was afraid I might not get great service sitting at a little table in the bar area.  Honestly, I think I got more attention from the staff than the customers in the dinning room.  The waitress was excellent.\n\nI had a drink of wine (needed it after that long day).  The waitress asked if I wanted another when it was about 1/4 empty and I told her I was only going to have this one glass  The glass sat for a while with just a little bit left on the bottom.  I was so happy no one took my glass away until I finished that last sip.  My glass of water was never allowed to get more than 1/2 empty.  This was excellent service.  \n\nThe food was outstanding.  I was so happy with every bit.  I started out with the tuna appetizer.  It was so fresh tasting, creative.  It was really amazing.  I then had the Lamb.  It was really, really good.

Although this place is upscale, the touch of french country flair in its interior makes it a little laid back but cozy. \n\nThe dishes are simple but artfully put together! I enjoyed my King Quail. They served the leg part crispy, almost like deep fried and the breast part, roasted. Best of both world! The leg part was topped with prosciutto and the breast was on a bed of delicious orange puree. We didn't get much appetizer because we had it at The View in Marriott Hotel but the Sea Scallop was irresistible! \n\nNo regrets on the Vanilla Bean Mouse for dessert, perfect with what it was served with: Strawberry Vanilla Sorbet Swirl. \n\nService: excellent and not annoying.

Just comparing this food against other 1 Star restaurants and I found the food missing in creativity and a Wow factor.  My foie Grau was slightly undercooked and needed more sear.  The pork chop was delicious but I was expecting to be wowed and I wasn't.  It was very good but not memorable.

Here's the deal: if you go, you'll get a decent, if unmemorable and unremarkable meal--for a boatload of money. The preparations are quasi-refined, striking a balance between American homey and haute cuisine, but the entire time while I'm there, there a little voice in my head whispering, \"Is this all? Where's the dazzle and razzle? No fireworks and shine?\"  The service is sorta courtly; notice my qualifier here, \"sorta,\" because they don't successfully pull off genteel charm, in fact, the one night we were there, our server was an auto pilot, phoning  it in, likely couldn't wait to get off his shift. I was completely unimpressed with our food, the lamb had little or no seasoning . . . ho hum. I do love the interior, which manages to be intimate and classy, old-worldly and oddly has a Parisian feel despite the American cuisine. The prices are waay too high for the quality of food--no value here. If ever there was a case of the emperor has no clothes, this restaurant is it.

The restaurant has a very nice trendy ambiance. We were seated right away. My mom made reservations, but I heard they happily take walk-ins.\n\nWe decided to share an appetizer, I chose the scallops. YUMMMM they were good. We also had a complimentary appetizer, a hamachi shooter which was very good. I wish that was on the menu, I would have asked for another. They then gave a palate cleanser before the entrees.\n\nMy entire family ordered the filet mignon and steak. I ordered the squab.

I love everything about this restaurant.  The exceptional service, the delectable food, the artistic presentation, the old-fashion charm and details - everything simply exudes Michelin quality dining.     \n\nA must have appetizer: SEA SCALLOPS - Zuckerman's Ultra Thin Asparagus & Asparagus Mousseline Lavender Gem Tangelo & Brown Butter\n- We get this every time we come here for dinner.  It's perfectly seared and buttery soft.\n\nFish options are usually my first choice. \n\nLOCAL SWORDFISH, GRILLED & WOOD OVEN ROASTED - Baby Artichoke Fritter with Castelvetrano Aioli, Potato Coins & Arugula Pesto, Plum Tomato Raisins, Currants & Pine Nuts \n- Swordfish tends to have a bit denser texture than most fish.  It's not your buttery sea bass, but it's still a wonderful dish in it's own way.  Definitely recommend it for anyone who has not tried it.\n\nALASKAN HALIBUT, A LA PLANCHA - Caper Spaetzle with Sprouted Lentils & Quinoa, Coal Roasted Fennel Puree & Bloomsdale Spinach, Baby Zucchini A La Plancha, Buerre Vert with Pickled Mustard Seeds \n- My second favorite fish.  Grilled to perfection and married with such beautiful flavors.  Totally a fan.\n\nPACIFIC SEABASS, PAN ROASTED - Vialone Nano Risotto with Celery & Celtuse, Bacalao Fritta & Smoked Aioli, Steelhead Roe & Horseradish \n- My absolute favorite fish dish.  It's buttery and flakey and everything you would expect a perfectly cooked fish to taste.  Simply divine.  \n\nIf you like fish, you really cannot go wrong with any of their choices.  But I would typically default to the bass :)\n\nPAN ROASTED CHICKEN BREAST - 'Panzanella' Sauce, Vine Ripe Tomatoes, Green Garbanzos, Baby Zucchini & Melted Garlic, Chicken \n - The chicken was really succulent.  Very well seasoned.  Mixture of both dark and white meat.\n\nLOCAL PETRALE SOLE A LA PLANCHA - California Asparagus, Colcannon Mashed Potatoes, Fondant Leeks, Watercress Hollandaise \n- This was a lunch item and it was perfect on a warm sunny day.  Of course, sole tends to be very mild and light.  So the watercress hollandaise, the mashed potatoes, and the asparagus kind of gave the whole dish more oomph.  \n\nWOOD OVEN ROASTED AMERICAN WAGYU BEEF BAVETTE - Delmonico Style Yukon Gold Potato, Sauteed Bloomsdale Spinach, Warm Mushroom, Bacon & Bourbon Onion Slaw, Beef Jus \n- This.Was.Amazing.  I like steak, but I don't LOVE it.  Ok, I lie.  I do love steak, but I'm not well rehearsed when it comes to the cut and grade and all that other stuff.  I just like to eat it.  But wagyu bavette is UH-AMAZING!!  It's so juicy, and tender, and perfectly marbled.

I had to walk up to the front to tell them so that they could write happy birthday on the dessert that we ordered. I thought about this one for a while and think I'm going with 3.5 stars rounded down. For a michelin star restaurant, I think I had slightly higher expectations. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the scallops and gnocchi w/ egg. I think these were by far the two best dishes of the night. The scallop was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi was extra flavorful and soft. \n\nFor main entrees my mom had the pork and my sister and I got the salmon. The fish was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Texture wise it was pretty nice, however flavor wise it was way too salty!! Each bite really felt like a big spoonful of salt. There was some very under-seasoned vegetables on the side to counter the heavy salt, but this made it so each bite tasted salty and bland at the same time. Overall I was not too impressed.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her pork a lot and dessert was good. We ordered a berry crisp and peach ice cream bon bon. Nothing mind blowing though.

I also had a wonderful salad of avocados, beautiful greens and perfectly ripe pink grapefruit with two Spanish cheeses - completely orgasmic. Yes - orgasmic and maybe even organic too.\n\nThe pork was chunks from their famous pork prime rib - slow Cooked crazy tender with volcanic flavors, served over a white corn polenta type preparation which I think had some cheese in it. Can't tell you just how good it was. Nicely charred crust of pork over succulent meat. I will be back for the full pork prime rib dinner soon. \n\nOne of my party is a vegetarian from Malaysia and asked whether they offered an appropriate dish - which as I told him was like asking for holy water in a Catholic Church. Hey - it's San Francisco after all. He wasn't disappointed. They served a selection of every veggie side on their menu - beautiful to behold and cooked and seasoned to perfection with nice fresh greens. Fantastic. \n\nFish dishes were super fresh and like other dishes really shows not only the quality of the raw ingredients used here but the skill of the chefs in applying heat - truly demonstrating the \"art\" of cooking and not just applying heat till done. \n\nDesserts over the top, polished and beautiful.

It makes you feel as if you're dining outdoors on the \"boulevard\" of a European street. The tables were nicely set for us when we got there. So you instantly get the vibe \"I'm paying for this not the food\". \n\nWe ordered the tuna tartare two ways, crab salad, wagyu burger, crispy duck breast, and salmon. \n\nThe tuna tartare was so pretty and the seaweed chips were super delicious, as for the actual tartare there was about a tablespoon of each. It was really bland as well. This isn't an appetizer that you can share.\n\nThe crab salad was the best thing here! It was either kale or chard. I'm not sure but it tasted awesome tossed in the vinaigrette dressing with a little bit of crab salad. The crab salad was made with actual crab meat and the shape of the crab legs were perfectly preserved without its shell. I highly recommend this appetizer to share with one person only. \n\nThe entrees were all very simple and over priced. But the duck was the most disappointing entree. It basically tasted like chicken katsu. It even looked like it with extra breading with very little meat. It came with an extremely bitter/burnt reduction.

My rating for now stands at a three given that any Michelin ranked restaurant should be able to deliver solid entrees.  Service was great and the atmosphere is warm and elegant. \n\n******\nMy boyfriend and I were so excited to dine here after hearing all of the rave reviews.  Perhaps our expectations were too high, but Boulevard did not live up to the hype.  Our main entrees were mediocre; however, they were bookended by solid appetizers and desserts. For entrees, my boyfriend and I shared the roasted local swordfish and the kurobuta pork chop.  I found the swordfish to be a bit bland in both flavor and presentation-- I felt like you could get the same dish somewhere else for much cheaper. If I'm paying $33 for a small piece of swordfish, I'd like each bite to be amazing.  This may sound strange, but the pork was a bit \"soggy\".  I believe that we did not finish the plate.  \n\nThough the entrees did not live up to the Michelin star hype, the appetizers and desserts left us wishing we had skipped our entrees all together.  Each bite of the california squab was bursting with flavor and I definitely fought for the last piece of the mouthwatering, crispy sweetbreads.  If I could have supersized something on the menu, it would have been the sweetbread appetizer. For dessert, we shared red velvet cake and another chocolate dessert. I don't condone this at nicer restaurants but my boyfriend, the resident chocoholic, literally drank the chocolate sauce out of the mini gravy boat and licked the plate clean.  \n\nStaff were very attentive and made sure to get us to the symphony on time, despite us running late, ordering 3 courses, and adding an extra appetizer at the last minute. \n\nThough the main entrees were underwhelming, I would probably come back to enjoy the atmosphere. Many restaurants are unable to achieve the balance of charm and understated elegance while still feeling warm and welcoming.  Whether you dress up or dress down you'll feel right at home--though I don't think a hoodie would necessarily be welcome here. .

I made a reservation for 8:15 on Monday about 2-3 weeks in advance with no problem.  The restaurant d\u00e9cor is beautiful and very unique.  You get a great view of the ferry terminal building and the bay bridge- absolutely gorgeous!  We were seated right away and greeted by our waitress.  We had some cocktails while looking through all the menu which was the perfect size.  The wine list was also great and we got someone to help us pick a bottle of delicious red wine for our meal.\nNow onto the food we started with two appetizers: the foie gras and the soft shell crab.  Oh my gosh both these dishes were AMAIZING!  There were 4 of us so this was the perfect way to start our meal.  From looking at the pictures on yelp it seems like the menu changes all the time but if you see foie gras or the soft shell crab with corn I really recommend.  The sauce with the crab was beyond delicious and it came with a chorizo, scallop, and shrimps sausage that literally blew me away.  I could have ordered that again for my meal and dessert!  \n\nFor our main meals the table ordered the stuffed quail and the lamb T-bone.  Both of these were delicious, but I can not explain how amazing the lamb T-bone was, it really blew my mind, the flavors were great and it was cooked perfectly.  I believe it was stuffed with a feta cheese and artichoke, it also had some potatoes but I could barley eat them the lamb was so good.  My husband had the quail and I tried that as well, So good!  I loved the cous cous that came with the quail, all of the components fit together so well!\n\nFinally we had to get dessert.  We had the berry crumble dish, chocolate pot, and the chocolate tart.  They were all good but I loved the berry crumble dish with buttermilk ice cream and delicious fresh fruit on top.  We were soooo stuffed but I really do recommend the dessert.  \nThis really was a great meal for a special occasion and I would love to come back here.  Its reasonably prices for the quality of food you are getting but you will spend a lot of money here.  Totally worth it in my opinion!", "author": "Kate F."}

It was super busy but the staff made sure I was 100% comfortable, 100% of the time.  When my entrees arrived, I didn't want the food to end!  I ordered the lamb and it was one of the best, if not the best, meal I have had in my life.  The meat was so tender and the pairings were amazing.  The scallops were also to die for and the home-made ravioli was spectacular.  For dessert I had the butterscotch pudding and it was very flavorful as well, especially paired with a recommended dessert wine.  Boulevard is definitely a destination restaurant that needs to be checked out if you're in San Francisco!", "author": "Matt N."}

The appetizers were very expensive ($25) and small, barely enough for one person. My husband got the filet which was supposed to come with Bernaise sauce but didn't. It was quite dry and had no flavor. It was almost $50 and didn't come with anything more than a small pile of green beans. I had the halibut which came with a very bland lemon sauce. The cocktails were good but very pricey and about half the size of an average cocktail. The service and ambience were the only saving grace of this former Michelin star restaurant.", "author": "Karen K."}

We honeymooned in Paris so this was quite fitting for the taste and senses of a year ago...  \n\nYou're taken in by the beautiful layout of the restaurant, the open kitchen lined with good looking people making delicious things.  And who can complain about the view if you sit close enough to the windows facing the Bay Bridge all lit up on Embarcadero.  \n\nWe were greeted by a lovely waitress by the name of Jay I believe.  We ordered our French wine, then stared at a menu that was perfect in selection but so difficult to pick.  Folks, you will want everything on the menu.  We settled for the lobster and sea scallops.  If you're gonna go rich, go all the way I say.  \n\nAs for entrees, I went for the halibut and my husband had the quail.  The plates were presented like a delicate piece of art.  We returned those same plates back as if they were blank canvases without shame.   The waitress reassured us that we were not the only people who ate everything on the plate, happens often there.  (wink wink)\n\nBy now we are full and happy.... until the dessert menu sneaks up.  One can not pass up on such experiences and opportunities.  We ordered the butterscotch pudding that was silky, smooth, and guided you into some sort of sweet bliss. Ahh we ate too much of just enough.  Splendid indeed.  \n\nI can't wait to go back there again...\"First Wedding Anniversary\" dinner was set high.

Located in Embarcadero, it definitely fits into the neighborhood with its upscale ambiance. Food and service were both mostly solid, with only a few hiccups. \n\nAlthough we had a 9pm reservation, we were still asked to wait for at least 15 minutes before our table was ready. Although there was a bar area to stand in, it was rather crowded and we had to shuffle around occasionally to make way for passing servers. \n\nThe food was very good - nothing too outstanding, but certainly what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. For starters, we opted for the scallops and tuna tartare to share and both dishes were executed well. The scallops were seared perfectly, and the tartare had plenty of flavor. The swordfish that I had for my main was seasoned and cooked perfectly as well. We opted to skip dessert as we were rather full, and none of the dessert options really stood out to us. \n\nService was friendly and decently attentive, although the wait for our main courses was a tad longer than expected. There was also no tasting poured for the wine that I ordered; the full glass was simply plopped on the table, which was somewhat surprising. \n\nOverall, Boulevard pulls together a solid fine dining experience, and I wouldn't mind returning to try some of their other dishes.", "author": "Oliver L."}

The fishes were fine, but the lamb was really something to get. I'm not much of a lamb guy but the smell was tolerable for me and it was tender and juicy so I was impressed. Gotta love the atmosphere there, although the restrooms are a bit far away, but you can take the elevator down and take the stairs back so you can see their Michelin stars on the wall. \n\nMoving on to desserts, again, not much of a chocolate dessert guy here, but the Choco-Licious tasted really good, not overwhelming at all. The lemon tart thing was also recommended, the sourness was all I needed to freshen all the courses that I had that evening. \n\nFinal tip, for those who weren't local. Use the restaurant valet instead of finding street parking (especially not the one next to the bridge). There were people smashing car windows on two sides of the street near by, leaving trails of shattered glasses, and people's stuffs got stolen and apparently it's common in SF!", "author": "Ian H."}

The ambiance is what you would expect for a FIDI crowd: a lot of older men in suits. A bit stuffy and old fashioned for my liking, but understand the allure that other people might find in it.  \n\nWe had a reservation so we were seated immediately. We decided on splitting several appetizers and one main so that we could try as much as possible: \n\nAhi Tuna Tartare Two Ways: This is one of the most beautifully presented dishes I've ever seen. However, the taste has much to be desired. The tuna was fresh enough, but the taro chips were a bit oily and the ingredients failed to add much flavor. \n\nMixed Lettuce Salad with Poached Seckle Pear: I believe this is a seasonal item, but in my opinion is should be on their regular menu. The candied walnuts and persimmons elevated the salad. It's never a good thing when my favorite dish of the meal is the salad, but in the case, I'll forgive Boulevard because this salad was just so good!\n\nSeared Day Boat Sea Scallops: This was served with a base of succotash of corn and beans and heirloom tomatoes. This dish was a bit heavy and nothing too special in my opinion. In my opinion, scallops are hard to mess up so if you're going to serve it, it should be accompanied with amazing flavors. This was not. \n\nGrilled Hawaiian Walu: For the main, we selected the fish garnished with roasted radicchio fennel, grapefruit, pomegranate relish, and crispy potatoes with creme fraiche. Everything about this dish was disappointing. I'm not too familiar with Walu, but I have had Roy's Misoyaki Butterfish several times and consider it far superior than Boulevard's fish course. This Walu did not melt in my mouth or have the same silky texture as Roy's. Nor did it make up for it in flavor. The grapefruit and radicchio were an odd combination and the creme fraiche was too heavy. The only thing I appreciated about the dish were pomegranate seeds, which I could purchase at a Safeway for $2. \n\nWhen it came time to order dessert, the waitress was nowhere to be found. I tried flagging one down several times, giving up to use the restroom and leaving my BF with instructions of what to order. When I came back, a waitress STILL had not stopped by. By that time, I was already late going back to the office, so we paid and left dessert-less. I was already disappointed in the meal, and the utter lack of service at the end confirmed my opinion: this place is way overpriced for what you are getting.

It's quite casual in appearance but the food is quite the opposite! Well plated and thought out. \n\n---Dishes we ordered---\nAppetizers: \n- Calamari stuffed with lobster & shiitake: interesting combination of different seafoods. My dad says its similar to a chinese dish that also stuffs various ingredients into calamari. I loved the chewiness of the calamari mixed with the tenderness of the stuffing. \n- wild boar & hand rolled pasta: so good! They cooked the pasta JUST right (al dente) and it was super chewy. The sauce was not overpowering but definitely enhanced the flavor of the pasta and wild boar. \n- Dungeness Crab Salad: sort of bland and nothing special. But if you love crab, not a bad choice\n- Scallops & Dungeness Crab Panzanella: The scallops were cooked well so that they were tender but not overcooked. My sister LOVED the polenta and devoured the entire plate's worth.\n\nEntrees: \n- Petrale Sole: so tender!! I LOVED this dish where it was slightly crunchy on the top but super soft and juicy when you take a bite of it. Too perfect!\n- Sea bass: Actually thought this was swordfish because it was so chewy. But definitely had a good flavor to it that is unique to this type of sea bass. I would recommend this after the sole if you're looking for a fish.\n- Pork Prime Rib Chop: One of their best dishes, my brother cleaned his plate up. The pork chop isn't over cooked at all. \n- Lamb T-bone: SO GOOD! If you're a lover of lamb, this is the dish for you. Cooked perfectly medium rare and full of juice!\n\nAlso, they have a $30 corkage fee if you want to bring your own wine. Definitely worth it in comparison to their prices on the wine list.", "author": "Chloe Y."}

For an appetizer, I would suggest the beet, heirloom tomato and blue cheese salad. It was a light enough starter, but still hearty with the blue cheese. For a main dish, the salmon was a great option. It was cooked to perfection, as expected, and came with chanterelle mushrooms and a beetroot risotto. The group I was with also raved about the lamb, so if you are more of a meat eater, I don't suspect you could go wrong. I went with a bunch of industry people, so during out meal both the sommelier and chef came over to the table to talk about the food which was a nice touch.

We arrived a little late for our reservation so we grabbed a drink at the bar. The gentleman who served us could not have been friendlier and I wish we would have just dined in the bar area. Upon seating our server greeted us and from that point forward the rest of our dinner just seemed very transactional. Our server asked if we would like another drink while our current drink was half full, when we didn't order any more alcoholic beverages it seemed as though our server could care less about us. The table behind us had four people ordering multiple expensive bottles of wine and it was very clear that she was very attentive to them, which is totally acceptable but I don't feel like she should have totally snubbed us. I have to say the abalone calamari was absolutely amazing.  My fianc\u00e9 had the duck and really enjoyed it. I decided to order a starter as my entree as I typically do when we are out of town because entrees tend to be to large of servings. When I told her I would have the risotto, she definitely made it a point to say I was ordering an appetizer. Once we had our main course she asked again if we wanted wine or a half glass of wine, which just made us feel super awkward as this was the third time she asked to get us a drink. We ordered dessert which was ok, definitely not a wow factor for the price of dessert ($11 & $12). So I would say if you want to spend $500+ on dinner your experience will probably be top notch, but spending $200 is definitely not enough to get quality service. If we decide to go back we probably just sit at the bar as the bartender was a true gem, and genuine.", "author": "Steph L."}

Served with polenta al nero, uni and Mangalitsa lard, the Nantucket scallops and local dungeness crab, ($16.50) were sweet and succulent.  The creamy richness of the cheese was a wonderful foil for the tangy acidity of the blanco grapefruit in the burrata, roasted beet, and citrus salad ($14.25).  Roasted in the wood-fired oven, the Eden Valley Berkshire pork prime rib chop ($37) served with smoked pork belly and apple agrodolce and Yukon gold potatoes with mustard and Douglas fir saut\u00e9ed erbette chard and Tokyo turnips was perfectly cooked, moist and juicy.  Served with Sicilian pistachios, roasted hamada grapes, cauliflower and lemon veloute, and Peruvian fingerling potatoes, the California lamb t-bone ($37) was presented off the bone perfectly medium rare.\n\nThe excellence does not stop after the main course; dessert is not an afterthought at Boulevard.  The flourless chocolate cake ($11) with olive oil ice cream, gummies, pistachio truffles, and caramel brown rice crisps was rich and decadent.

As luck would have it, Ben was there, and we had a chance to tell him how much we appreciated his great service those four years ago when we had that first date. \n\nBoulevard is not a great restaurant simply because of that experience. It's a great restaurant because it's a beautiful space, the food is tremendous, and the staff is highly professional and gracious. Nancy Oakes is a tremendous talent who knows how to get the best from her staff. They are loyal to her because of her great professionalism; case in point being Ben, who has worked there for more than twenty years. \n\nRestaurants who manage to hang onto great staff for that long are restaurants that do things right. Boulevard is a classic example of that.", "author": "Charles W."}

The decor was cute and the venue was a lot bigger than I had expected. This place exudes a very comfortable vibe... we wanted to drink Pinots all night and people watch from our gorgeous view but we saved that for the after dinner festivities.\n\nSo out comes the Calamari appetizer that changed my life (not really, just being dramatic) but it was SO DARN DELICIOUS! I've never had calamari prepared like this before, it was barely-to-lightly battered and filled with some joy and served over this \"dark\" or sepia fried rice. Now that rice had some bang of flavor with it, almost seem like it was cooked in a seafood broth. \n\nThe official appetizer description:\nCALAMARI STUFFED with LOBSTER & SHITAKE\nSepia Fried Rice, Octopus & Meyer Lemon\nGolden Enoki Mushrooms & Scallions\n\nGET IT!!!\n\nFor entrees we both ordered different types of fish (Seabass & Halibut) which was soft and flavorful.

He didn't offer to open up our wine until we asked, and when we did, he opened both, left them on the table, and immediately wandered off for about ten minutes. When he finally noticed that we'd been sitting around with empty glasses for kind of awhile, he just dumped the wine into everyone's glasses without doing the tasting or anything! Not what I would've expected from a 1-star. I decided the food would have to be amazing to justify the rating, and it actually did manage to meet my now-elevated expectations. \n\nDefinitely order the crispy oysters with carpaccio and avocado and dungeness crab appetizers. The dungeness crab in particular surprised me -- so many bold flavors packed into a dish that also managed to be light, and they all worked so well together. For my main I did the petrale sole with clams, and again was surprised with how flavorful the dish was. I really liked the clams, which had a pesto-breadcrumb-like topping, and the brussels sprouts that came with the fish were really tasty.

However, they sat us at a table that was pretty far away and was placed in the wrong area, I had waiters keep walking by and hitting my chair because our table was sticking out into the walkway. They had told me that it was the closest they can put us because all of tables closer were for bigger groups, However, later on we clearly saw a couple sitting at one of the small tables next to the window.

Very elegant with French touches.  There were wine bottles scattered throughout the bar ordered by different parties starting off the night. The bottles made great d\u00e9cor for a first bar impression.\n\nOur party arrived and we were seated. Our waitress was really nice but she seemed overworked. It's great that she was hustling but this isn't BJ's. At a restaurant like this, you want your server to be attentive and patient. It got better throughout the night... or maybe the booze kicked in and we no longer cared.\n\nFor dinner I had the pork prime rib chop with pears and candy yams. I think I need to say it again. Pork-Prime-Rib- with- PEARS- and -CANDY yams. It didn't even taste like a pork chop it tasted like heaven. And the pears complimented it perfect. My husband had the lamb and didn't care too much for it (but he's also not much of a lamb eater to begin with).  I'm sure he was wishing he ordered my plate. I gave him a little bite to try (nothing less and definitely nothing more! Too good to share).\n\nIn the end, I was really impressed with the ambiance, wine, and meal.

The dish was small, but more than enough to share 'cause I think after one piece of gnocchi, i probably couldn't have eaten more 'cause of the richness. \n\n-Scallops: We also got scallops as appetizers and the waitress was kind enough to add an additional one to our plate so that we didn't have to split the 3rd scallop. Nothing overly creative or unique about the dish, but the scallop was cooked and seasoned perfectly. \n\n-Lamb: The date ordered this one and he said he thoroughly enjoyed it. I usually don't order lamb 'cause I generally don't like the smell of it, though I did take a bite and it was pretty good. \n\n-Halibut: I ordered this as my entree, and I think the fish was a little more on the dry side than I had hoped for. Was a little disappointing, but nonetheless the overall dish was pretty good. \n\nI took a star off because I felt that even though the service was good, and most of the food we ordered were executed well, for a restaurant of this caliber and the amount of money we spent, we've had better food at better restaurants.

I could barely move in my chair as we were so squezzed in and could not converse with the other couple that well.  The womens' bathroom was downstairs and not convenient at all.\n\nOur waiter was nice and had a good personality and offered suggestions on the menu, had a great sense of humor and had been there quite awhile so that was a plus.\n\nThree of us ordered the salmon and one of us had the porkchop.  When we got our salmon, I was shocked at how small the portions were  -- almost appeared to be appetizer/tapas portion.  Mind you, I am a petite woman with a small appetite.  The desserts were boring.  My boyfriend ordered cheese at desert time.  He got a one-inch square of cheese that cost about $9.00.   We thought it was a joke.  We have had cheese for desert at other high-end restaurants and have been satisfied with the sampling of cheese portions.\n\nBottom line - the food was good but nothing what I would expect from a Michelin-rated restaurant. \n\nNeedless to say, we left hungry and underwhelmed.

The pork was some of the most tender meat I've ever had and the risotto and truffles you could smell from across the table. Both delicious. \n\nDessert was the main complaint for me. After ordering a cappuccino and a butterscotch pudding the cappuccino took about 10 min to come and I was waiting for it before it came. After 10 min a small shot of espresso came out with no steamed milk. Because of the long wait I just drank it. The pudding was great, some granola and nuts really balanced it out and gave it a nice crunch. \n\n\nHighly recommend the pork loin and the burger if you want something simpler.", "author": "Eric R."}

The service is a little lacking, especially for the reputation the restaurant has.  My husband & I came here for dinner for our 2nd wedding anniversary.  There's only street parking and or you can use their valet.  It was a Monday, and our reservations were at 6:30pm.  The placed was packed when we got there and we were seated right away\n\nOur waiter took our drink orders soon after we were seated.  For appetizer, I ordered the sea scallops & my husband got the stuffed calamari.  The calamari is usually stuffed with lobster and shitake mushrooms, but my husbands just had mushrooms (no lobster but for the same price $).  My scallops were cooked perfectly and came with shaved asparagus and asparagus mousseline (you get two scallops).\n\nOur dinner took a while to come out & the waiter came around twice letting us know it was coming out soon.  I ordered halibut and my husband ordered the pork chop.  My halibut came with caper spaetzle, sprouted lentils & quinoa with a fennel puree.  I loved the combination of all these ingredients & I would never think to pair them together.  My husband's pork chop was cooked medium and was juicy and tender.\n\nOn to dessert...I ordered the rocky road walnut brownie and cocoa nib ice cream & my husband got the buffalo milk cheesecake.  Our desserts had a \"Congrats\" and \"Happy Anniversary\" on it and that was a really nice touch.  My husband really liked his cheesecake.  my brownie was pretty dense and hard but was good when you ate the ice cream with it.  The peanut butter fudge didn't taste like peanut butter, but my husband ate all of mine.\n\nI would have given 3 stars because I didn't think service was up to par, but the food made up for it.

It is easy to distinguish the differences that make a fine dining restaurant such as Boulevard superior to the more typical \"standard\" ones. The classy decor sets the stage for what should be a pleasant meal. Still Boulevard does have its faults; the tables are very small and I often found that plates had to be rearranged and placed all the way to the edges to ensure that everything would fit. \n\nOur waitress met us with smiles and provided us with above-average service. Still at times I felt she was inattentive, definitely not the best service I've ever had, but no where near the worst.\n\nAs for the food itself; terrific! \nFor me the appetizers were the star with the Fava Bean & Parmesan Raviolini standing out the most. When you first take a bite out of the raviolini the strenght of the cheese is pretty overwhelming, but after swallowing down this delicious treat you will be met with the most satiating after taste. If you're into rich cheese (like truffle cheese) this is a must.\n\nFor my entree I had the Pork Chop. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and tasted delicious however I felt it was missing something. The House in SF has a better pork chop in my opinion which is 100% attributed to the delicious sauce that goes over theirs. Still the pork chop was tasty and I definitely would recommend it.\n\nOverall, Boulevard provided top-tier food in a very elegant environment. I would definitely come here again.", "author": "Eddie K."}

The foie gras was perfect. Presentation wise I've never seen better foie gras. The octopus was really good although kinda spicy so if you can't do spicy foods stay away from the octopus. The main courses we ordered were the angus filet and kurobuta pork chop. The filet was super juicy and cooked to perfection. The pork chop was done really well also! The bits of bacon was also a nice add on to it! Our waiter recommended us some wine to go with our entrees which made the whole dining experience better. For dessert we got chocolate and butterscotch which our waiter said was the most popular desert.

I rarely seem to agree with that rating scale so a 3 star review comes at no surprise to me.\n\n3 stars for food, 2 stars for value, and 5 stars for ambiance and service.\n\nLet's get serious though, you're all probably wondering how the food is. I spent quite awhile reading the reviews, figuring out what to order, and after thorough reading, I was not able to arrive at any conclusion except that the place was expensive. I decided to just play it by ear and ask for the server's recommendations when I arrived.\n\nThis is one of those places you go to for your 50th anniversary, or take clients to for business dinners. And clearly, based on the clientele, this rule seems to hold true. I was a fan of the cocktail list, but I felt that they needed to be more stiff. \n\nThe appetizers were weak. The scallops were good but very expensive, and the calamari with stuffed lobster was decent at best. I didn't even finish it.\n\nThe lamb came out almost cold, but it was cooked perfectly. So tender you might mistake it for fillet mignon or something. Points docked here because I wasn't a fan of the sauce. It's thickened like 5a5's, and could have been tastier. I also split the porkchop, which again was perfectly cooked. This was definitely the winner between the two entrees, but didn't blow me away.\n\nFor dessert, I INHALED the chocolate mousse cake. Make sure you get dessert.\n\nOverall, I was a bit unimpressed given Boulevard received 1 Michelin star, but I think it was still a good meal and a nice place to celebrate occasions.

The space is beautiful, older, dark and elegant -- a nice change from the other more industrial and trendy spaces in San Francisco. The mosaics on the floor alone are impressive.\n\nThe wine list is extensive. I enjoyed a glass of cab from Sonoma, and then devoured the grilled swordfish accompanied by a berry sauce, purple cabbage, and a prosciutto or jambon ($30). The fish was perfectly cooked, juicy and fresh. The sweet berry sauce was the perfect accompaniment. It is among my favorite fish dishes I've experienced. I had no appetizers or salads, as they seemed the most unreasonable to me at $10-14 per item.\n\nMy server was very friendly, but there were sometimes lengthy waits between visits. Most obvious to me was what seemed like a 10 minute or more wait for my wine after I had placed the order at the beginning of my visit. A 10-15 minute wait for a glass of wine seemed a bit excessive, and dinner took a while too. The restaurant was very busy and a lovely place to wait, but some attention should be paid to those initial few moments of the guest experience. \n\nThe dessert menu looked incredible, especially the dulce leche.

It came from a place you sealed off from the rest of the world and seldom opened, and even then only for brief periods, lest it not be containable. And while that still holds true to some extent, I've also learned that it can come from other places as well, like forgiveness, in opening yourself up to becoming vulnerable, and food. Definitely food. And perhaps beverages. And also recreational sports.\n\nA good case in point, Boulevard. Whenever I stumble into the city I more often than not end up doing something remarkable, but this place isn't just good, it's great. I could literally eat here every meal for the remainder of my days and yet be perfectly content. I really wish to bow deeply to the entire staff, especially to Nancy, Dana, Tim & Lisa for bringing to life such an utterly fantastic menu based on the principals of sustainability; each item is its own reward.  Every facet of the meal, from the courses, to drinks, to dessert, has been thought out in vivid detail.\n\nLike any evolved human, I can certainly take enjoyment in the modern luxuries life in the present day has to offer, we truly do live in pretty exciting times, but a part of my soul yearns to be part of a simpler time, a time long gone by. The interior of the establishment takes one back to such a time. Warm and inviting, with just the right tinge of a modern touch, it sets an elegant backdrop perfectly. If you close your eyes, you can almost be transported to an era where people dressed to the nines, business was done outside the office, and fittingly, over a martini lunch.\n\nFortunate as I am to have worked through a good part of the menu, I've encountered nothing but hits, not yet a single miss. I'd highly recommend a show of appreciation to the staff of this restaurant (And any other for that matter) by bringing in for them a case of Modelo (Or similar) for the cooks. I've been spoiled in that I'll rarely order prime rib off any menu, I've had the good stuff and quite frankly most places will leave me afterward in a state of dejected disappointment. Boulevard will put on your plate a prime rib you will want to write about even weeks or months later.\n\nA \"Prime Rib Good\" tip may have sufficed, however this is dedicated to a special someone who requested I write again, and inspiration is where you find it. If you don't like Boulevard, realize that you have bad taste in food and seek help immediately.\n\nSoundtrack: Brian Jonestown Massacre - \"Anemone\"\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6R9WSClRfE", "author": "Robert Z."}

So, here is where we celebrated our five year anniversary.\n\nFirst, this place was CROWDED on an early Wednesday night.  Make reservations or try to snag a seat at the bar overlooking the kitchen. The decor is more classic than contemporary, which makes sense as it's been around for something like twenty years. I liked the curved, brick ceiling and the velvet seats.\n\nThe tips and reviews led me to believe that I would be offered a foie gras special despite the CA ban, so I was so, so sad when the server said that there were no specials for the night.  I was even sadder when I saw that the scallop appetizer wasn't on the menu for the night, too! Oh well. \n\nI have pretty much the same thing to say about everything we ordered.  The ahi tuna starter, the lobster, and the filet were all good dishes, a bit on the small side, but nothing that made my eyes roll back.  Nothing really bad to say, but I'm not dying to come back here.  We split the baked Alaska for dessert, and we both thought that we could have done without it.  \n\nThe cost for one cocktail, one non-alcoholic mocktail, one starter, two entrees, and one dessert came out to $160 after tax and tip, which I think is standard for a restaurant with one Michelin star, but I think I enjoyed my meals at similarly regarded restaurants much more. \n\nOh, and even though I specified that we were celebrating an anniversary in my reservation, it was not acknowledged by anyone.

My friend had told me Boulevard isn't what it used to be and not as popular--I guess this experience aligned with that statement.

Firstly Mr Waiter if the guests are having a conversation and enjoying themselves  please don't continuously  interrupt , your not the center of attention so please stop trying to be . Secondly four of the entrees were cold and returned . They reheated them and returned them but they are  still cold ( no manager checked with us to see if they were ok ). But  Guys , who reheats food in a fine dining restaurant ???? This is not Chilis , Its the Boulevard !\n\nSo now I ask to see the manager , between 5 n 10 minutes later a lady appears to 1/2 heartedly apologize ( Peter was off ) and explains that its policy to reheat food and that these things happen . We reorder , food arrives , its Ehh , Waiter interrupts again , no desert , no coffee , No real attempt to resolve a poor experience . \nNot your finest hour .", "author": "Dominic J."}

This last week, however, I was sorely disappointed.  The service was friendly and efficient, and I had but one complaint with it (more later).  With the exception of a fabulous salad and a stunning desert, the food was a failure on the part of the kitchen.  We had the lamb and the duck.  Both arrived at the table lukewarm to cold.  Lamb that is anything but hot is not fit to be served in a fine restaurant.  The duck, also on the cool side, was tough.  Neither dish had much flavor.  When the waiter came to ask how things were, we said not so good.  He offered to take them back for heating.  I declined, since I'd rather have succulent lamb that was lukewarm than hot but dry lamb.  A better offer, it seemed to me, was to start over with fresh entree's and get it right the second time.  In a first-rate restaurant, there is no excuse for any error in either service or in the food.  I am reluctant to spend the kind of money this kind of restaurant (rightly) charges for a second-rate offering.  I hope the kitchen hears this, and returns to their former relentlessness pursuit of perfection.", "author": "Jeff D."}

Fortunately, I am on a work trip and my awesome VP recommended this place and said it was on her! I had the crab and avocado and a California Red. It was THE BEST CRAB I HAVE EVER HAD. It was perfectly cooked, not too salty, and beautifully presented. The flavor of the crab was an explosion of decadence and it was without the \"fishy\" flavor that sometimes permeates fresh seafood. I'm aware that I'm probably not eating at the right places, but it didn't have that \"imitation crab\" rubbery feel that also accompanies supposedly fresh seafood. The avocado and additional veggies were great too-- perfectly seasoned, just crispy enough, and overall, wonderful. I don't have enough adjectives to describe how amazing this meal was-- just go check it out. The service was also wonderful. We went on a Thursday night after our conference adjourned and got right in-- a table near the bar! The waiter was attentive, gave good advice about the food, and was not pushy. Overall, a really great experience. I hope one day I can go back!!", "author": "Kait B."}

Peut-etre...\n\nAs the \"father\" of Prospect, Boulevard offers American fare with French influences in a classy and old-fashioned atmosphere that I can see why it's favored among the more mature crowd.\n\nI've had Boulevard bookmarked for months because I heard such great things about it. Other than going as a basis for comparison of Prospect (Chef Nancy Oakes' New Infinity Restaurant), nothing really enticed me enough to put it on the top of my list. However, needing to put a dent on our Yelp bookmarks and with Boulevard both on our list, fellow Yelper and my friend, Heather C. and I decided to tackle this Michelin rated restaurant first. \n\nOn Wednesday, 12/8/10, we arrived at 7 PM for our 6:30 PM reservations and were promptly seated. I called earlier to inform the hostess that we were running late because we were both stuck in rush hour traffic which she said would be fine. \n\nF O O D:\n*FOIE GRAS w/ Yuzu Marmalade & Persimmons ($27): YUMMY! \n\nThe generous slab of foie gras was perfectly seared w/ a caramelized crust. It was decadently rich, savory and melted on my tongue like a triple cream butter. The slightly tart and acidic yuzu help counterbalance some of the richness while the al-dente persimmons added a nice subtle sweetness. The bread, similar to a honey bran muffin was dry and dense and ruined the integrity of the entire dish. I'm not sure if they were trying to take a \"healthy\" approach to this dish, but if I'm going to clog my arteries with fattened liver, please bring on the toasted brioche please! \n\n*LAMB CHOP & LOIN w/ Artichoke Heart & Aioli and Saut\u00e9ed Spinach ($36): GOOD, but not great.\n\nAlbeit a bit bland, both the lamb chop and loin were perfectly cooked to a medium rare with a soft pink center. While both tender and moist, the lamb chop was richer in flavor with a slight gaminess, while the loin was leaner and tasted similar to steak sirloin. The aioli filled artichoke heart added a creamy punch of flavor to under-seasoned lamb while the spinach added a fresh hint of bitterness tying the dish together.\n\n*FROMAGE CHEESECAKE w/ a Pistachio Crust & Lemon Sherbet ($10.50): WHOA...can I kiss the pastry chef??? *wink wink* This dessert had a complexity of different flavors and textures that worked in perfect harmony together.\n\nThe pistachio crust was light, crisp and flakey and was the perfect texture contrast to the cheesecake that was velvety rich, fluffy and slightly sweet with a hint of tang. The subtle vanilla flavor from the Chantilly cream added a layer of decadence while the lemon sherbet gave it a citrus freshness that made you feel you weren't committing a \"complete\" sweet tooth sin. \n\nS E R V I C E:\nFriendly and attentive but slow. Our 3-course menu lasted over 2.5 hours as it took over 25 minutes to get our app and over 40 minutes to get our entr\u00e9e. If you're under a time constraint, you may want to go elsewhere. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D \u00c9 C O R:\nSituated in a French Colonial style building in front of the Embarcadero's waterfront, Boulevard exudes Old World Charm which attracts a refined and more mature crowd. Although stuffy, dark woods, amber lighting and an open kitchen created a warm and somewhat inviting environment.\n\nWhile a nice date place, with seating for nearly 150 people and tables tightly situated together, it makes it difficult to carry an intimate conversation without having to raise your voice. \n\nThe restrooms were difficult to find and it took a few wrong turns before I could find it. They also needed to be tended to because there were un-flushed toilets and seat covers hanging all over. \n\nP A R K I N G:\nSemi-difficult street parking after 6 PM. Valet parking is available for $8 for dinner or there's a parking garage located 1.5 blocks away on Spear St between Mission and Market St. \n\nI enjoyed my dinner at Boulevard, however, for a restaurant of this caliber, it was lacking both an oomph factor in its food and time management in its service for it to be worthy of 5 Stars. \n\nI can now see why Michael Bauer coined Boulevard as the sire of Prospect, but with its classic fare and dated ambiance, I think \"grandfather\" is a more appropriate term...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Right off the bat, walking up to Boulevard, you can see the building it's in is quite charming, and then you enter the interior... and it's also really beautiful. Although Boulevard's ambiance is very upscale, it felt warm and inviting. I started with a Burrata salad and had salmon as my entree. Both dishes had amazing flavors paired together and the quality was excellent! The  menu options had a more European feel. This restaurant is great for a special occasion -- date, fancier dinner with the family, etc. If you're a foodie living in the Bay, definitely put Boulevard on your list.", "author": "Jean L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-11-26", "description": "***Boulevard is a nice, rustic and seasonal restaurant; there are parts of each course that are very impressive, but I do not think it is as good as my favorite rustic restaurants--Lucques, the now closed Campanile, The Village Pub, and The Farmhouse Inn & Restaurant***\n\nNancy Oakes' Boulevard is a very longstanding upscale San Francisco restaurant.  It recently won the James Beard award for best restaurant in the country and it remains popular today.  Despite the large size of the restaurant, it was quite busy for lunch on my visit.\n\nThe lunch menu at Boulevard is very seasonal from starters to desserts.  Their lunch menu includes a lot of lunch-type dishes like salad entrees, but you will find more dinner-esque items too like housemade pasta, scallop starters and ambitious desserts.\n\nI started with their salad of mixed organic lettuces, poached Seckle pear, Hamada persimmons, Bayley Hazan blue cheese, and candied walnuts.  The salad immediately reminded me of a Waldorf Salad.  It was a great combination of flavors and contrasting textures.  The produce was fresh and vibrant.\n\nWhile I felt the greens were kind of ordinary and the blue cheese did not have the uniqueness of great blue cheese I have had, I really liked the poached pear--lightly sweet and tender but not soggy or too soft.  The candied walnuts provided a good and sweet crunch.  I also liked the persimmons, which had a good flavor though Lucques' burrata and persimmon salad is superior to this one.\n\nNext came the beet pyramid ravioli.  The ravioli was pretty good.  It had a good pasta thickness and the beet puree was very creamy though the beet flavor was not as strong as I was expecting.  The garnishes were great.  I really liked the crunch from the toasted almonds and rye berries.  The Cana 'd Cabra goat cheese was very creamy and had a more distinct flavor than the earlier blue cheese.\n\nI then had the seared day boat sea scallops and they were nicely cooked--good outside sear (nicely golden and flavorful), soft and moist.  The base of succotash with yellow and white corn with heirloom beans was the kind of side you would just not find at a merely good restaurant.  The succotash was fresh and very evenly cooked.  The overall flavor combination was not as great as other scallops dishes I have had, but this was still a good dish.\n\nI had the butternut squash cake next, which was garnished with creamy and sweet maple sugar creme, sage ice cream, a very tart brown butter hard sauce, and crunchy Piedmontese hazelnuts.  The cake was soft and not dry though the butternut squash flavor was not as strong as it should have been.  It was not a great dessert, but it showed that the kitchen might be able to put out some excellent desserts in the future.\n\nService was good.  The servers were pleasant but not as friendly as other places--mostly due to the brisk pace of the restaurant.  The service was attentive, efficient and quick.\n\nLunch prices are not too bad here.  Boulevard is definitely pricey, but it is an upscale place with high quality ingredients and strong talent in the kitchen.\n\nThe decor at Boulevard is okay.  It has an open kitchen, which is nice.  At first blush, the room feels out-of-fashion, but it has a decor that embraces its building's existing structure and design, which makes the decor feel right and not needing of a change.\n\nBoulevard is a good and solid restaurant.  There is definitely strong technique in the kitchen and a very good attention to detail (down to the nicely plated desserts and good table bread with a great chew).  I like the seasonal approach and the freshness and flavor of the produce.  Boulevard is not as ambitious or creative as some of San Francisco's newer and more contemporary restaurants, but it remains a solid choice for a nice upscale lunch.\n\nValet parking is available.  You can also find metered street parking near the Ferry Building.", "author": "Anthony N."}

I thought it was one of those overhyped, over priced type restaurants despite the awards it had received...had I reviewed it on Yelp then, I'd probably have only given it a 2 based on the food, service, and experience. But when the partner at my firm picked this place to come for lunch, who was I to say no?\n\nWe came here around 12:30 and were seated right away. There was quite a range of people here: corporate business types, the super casual start-up types the touristy types, etc etc..so it was already little different from my previous dinner experience.\n\nThe food this time was actually decent. Perhaps now that my expectations had been lowered, I wasn't expecting anything to blow my socks off.\n\nI ordered:\n\n1. Ahi Tuna Tartare - This was really good. The chips were a bit on the oily side, but I just ditched the chips and dived straight into the fish. It was fresh and well seasoned. I definitely enjoyed it.\n\n2. The Salmon - This was ok. It definitely wasn't the best I'd ever had...and if I had to rate the salmon just on its own, i would probably only give it a 2. There were some bites that were delish..and some bites that were really bland. Meh.\n\n3. Butterscotch pudding - this was pretty decent, but not my favorite.\n\n4. Lemon Bar - YES. It was so good. I love lemon bars...so I'm definitely biased. It was still good though. yes. noms.\n\nOverall elevated my experience here from a 2 to a 3, not a huge leap, but definitely somewhere I'd try again. :)", "author": "Jennifer S."}

The sea bass was tasty and it was cooked right... not dry at all. The side dishes that accompanied the fish tasted wonderful as well... the Pancetta was crispy!\n\nFor drinks... I started off with my Hanger One Kaffir Lime with 7-UP... then the sis ordered a bottle of the Chablis Grand Cru = my new fave white wine!\n\nOverall, service was perfect. Food was excellent!

The brown bread pairing threw us off, but the foie gras itself was marvelous, melting in our mouths. Also noteworthy was their scallops appetizer, a rich, tender treat.

I had reservations at 6:15 on a Sunday, the hostess was pleasant and greeted us with a smile, and we were seated promptly. Our server came by, offered us some water and gave us a few moments to look over the menu. \n\nStarters:\nWe started off with the \"smoked veal sweetheart sweetbreads and  \"goat cheese, marcona almonds, & arugula\". The sweetbreads came with two pieces on top of a thin sheet of mashed potatoes and were crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. While it wasn't a bad dish, it didn't have a wow factor about it. The arugula salad however, was pretty good. I loved the marcona almonds it came with and the thick cut slices of goat cheese were delicious.\n\nBread:\nWe didn't receive our bread until after our starters came out. Oh well. The cold bread was served with room temperature butter with sea salt on top. The butter stole the show on this compliment. \n\nEntrees:\nMy bf ordered the pacific sea bass and he enjoyed his dish. The celery root pur\u00e9e it was served on top of was tasty and all of the components worked well together. I ordered the wood oven roasted pork prime rib chop and the meat was juicy and cooked perfectly. However, the yams that came with it were served cold! Yuck. It was as if my yams had been cooked first and left to sit on a cold plate while they started on the actual entree. While the maple bourbon sour cream sounded enticing, it didn't do much for the dish overall. \n\nDessert: \nWe decided to share the \"holiday plate\". It consisted of what looked and tasted like a sugar cookie wreath with red and green sprinkles that I could have bought a dozen of at the local grocery store for $3.99. A mini red velvet cupcake that tasted also store bought, a wrapped candy caramel, a piece of fudge, a nice attempt on a take of an ice cream sandwich, and a chocolate brownie tasting thing. In the words of Chef Ron Ben-Israel.... \"In this test, you were no sweet genius.\" What this dessert plate really should have been named was \"store bought dessert items that were on clearance\" because that's what it tasted like. \n\nService: \nFor a restaurant to toot their horn on their food and service, our waiter failed to channel that on this particular night. We didn't get his name until our tab was presented to us and his name \"Hunter\" was printed on the receipt. I felt like we were shafted with the mute waiter that night. Maybe because we are younger than the crowd that they're usually accustomed to catering? Maybe he was having a bad night? Whatever the reason, the service wasn't warm and welcoming as I would have expected. \n\nThe overall experience wasn't bad, wasn't as good as I had hope and expected, and wasn't memorable.

The interior looks like an old vegas restaurant, with the crowd to match. Ordered the black truffle pasta starter for $37, but couldn't taste any truffle whatsoever. You could see the truffle, but couldn't taste it at all. So all I can think is that the truffle was very low quality. Had the pork chop entree  and while it was cooked very nicely, it had zero seasoning. Very disappointing experience overall. At 35 years old, I was the youngest person there. I would say the food very much matches the older crowd that is used to waiters wearing vests and ties, and boring hotel style food.

Warm ambiance.\nCons:    A tad (or 2 tads) expensive.  Bathroom is in a strange location.\n\nSuggestion:  Request a table by the Embarcadero window.  Order the Chocolate Pot De Creme.\n\nStar Ratings:\n-   Overall:     4 1/2\n-   Food Quality:   5\n-   Food Quantity:   4\n-   Menu:     5\n-   Wine List:    5\n-   Service:    5\n-   Bathrooms:    3\n-   Price:    4\n-   Value:    5\n-   Parking:     4\n-   Ambiance:    5\n\nIt's been said there are more restaurants per person in SF than anywhere else in the US.  I believe it.  So when a couple of clients came to town at the beginning of a 4 day vacation in Napa Valley, my partner (in business) and I wanted to find something worthy of 2 very good people.  A place which looked and tasted fine without breaking the bank. \n\n-   Location:  Boulevard is in a beautifully restored building facing the Embarcadero at the end of Mission Street.  If you're lucky enough, you might get a spot with views from the Ferry Plaza to the Bay Bridge.  We did.  It was gorgeous.\n\n-  Dining Room:  The room is much longer than it's wide with a good sized bar along one wall in the middle.  As befits a long-time establishment still in great demand, tables are spaced to almost maximize the number of patrons. However, you can get around without bumping the elbows of strangers and hold a conversation in a nearly normal tone of voice.  Ambiance is expensive yet warm and friendly.  Upper crust for everyday people.\n\n-   Menu:   The menu is rather small, but as I said to a dinner companion, it doesn't need to be large if the selections are well chosen and executed.  Although the number and type can change on a daily basis, I counted 10 \"starters\", 7 entrees and 7 desserts.  The written descriptions were a bit high-fallutin' as if well versed prose counted toward more points, but I guess that goes with the territory.\n\n-   Food:   Good looks will only take you so far.  Did the interesting menu translate to the plate?  It did.  Three of the 4 diners began with a \"starter\", including Pan Seared Scallops, Fairytale Pumpkin Soup and Beet Ravioli.  Portions were not huge, but everyone was happy.  The sauce with my ravioli was so good I needed extra slices of Boulevard's Acme sourdough to sop it up.  That sourdough was so tasty I could've had dinner with just bread, butter and wine.\n\nEntrees were along that same vein...exotic sounding but with both feet close to the ground.  Everything earned a thumbs up.  My Alaskan Halibut sat on a bed of tomato risotto with small amounts of vegetables on the side.  The sauce draining through that risotto was so compelling I once again called upon the Acme bread to help clean my plate.  Good sourdough is as close to heaven as most people will get. \n\nMy tablemates had Wild King Salmon...Lamb Prime T-Bone...and something called New England Lobster Clam Bake with a cornmeal clam fritter and steamed mussel.  Each was accompanied by vegetables.  Nary a complaint was voiced.\n\nDessert was unreal.  While our clients chose to close dinner with a drink, my partner and I each ordered the \"Chocolate Pot De Creme\".  It was ONE OF THE BEST EVER.  We each received a bowl with flourless chocolate cake topped with caramel malt syrup, Guinness meringue, milk chocolate lace and malted ice cream.  Just the right amount and combination of ingredients.  Holy moly.\n\n-   Wine List:   As expected, the list was rather extensive.  However, it was well grouped and easy to understand. When we had a question, our server flagged the Sommelier who provided good advice without running up the tab. We each had a glass of chardonnay and shared a bottle of Fiddlesticks Pinot Noir from the Fiddlehead Winery near Lompoc.  A fine choice for $72.\n\n-   Service:   Friendly, efficient and accommodating.  Our server, a youngish woman (aren't they all?), had an excellent understanding and perspective of the menu.  In particular, her patience to answer what some might consider \"niggling\" questions was quite admirable.\n\n-   Price and Value:  Boulevard is not cheap.  $460 for 4 people is a bit steep to become a habit except for those with top tier jobs, a portfolio of lucky stocks with a low cost basis or an expense account.  Of course, value is something else.  It's not a cheap date, but one you won't regret.\n\n-   Parking:  Valet parking at dinner is a reasonable $10.  Self parking is available a block away.  Parking on the street is chancy...especially at night.\n\n-   Bathroom:  The bathroom was fine - when we found it.  You need to exit Boulevard through a seemingly innocuous door into the hallway of an adjacent building and walk down a flight of stairs.  At least it was good exercise.\n\nFor people living 50-60 miles away from San Francisco (such as me), Boulevard is almost a destination. Despite the hassles of driving through traffic on potholed streets, I must say the end justified the means.  I'll be back.", "author": "Richard N."}

Took one bite of this and knew it was the wrong choice. The steak was a bit tough and dry for my taste so I wouldn't recommend the steak. Lamb was tender and juicy. Good, but not memorable. It was served with deliciously cooked potatoes and pistachios that gave it a nice crunch. The quail was the best of the three entrees. The meat was tender and succulent. Skin was crunchy.\n\nDesserts Ordered: dirty cowgirl, cheesecake, olive oil ice cream. Our waiter highly recommended the dirty cowgirl but we all found the dessert covered in strawberries to be mediocre. Cheesecake was my favorite. Loved the creamy texture of the cheesecake combined with the crunchiness of the crust. Highly recommend this! Was intrigued by the olive oil ice cream but found it to be light in flavor and unmemorable along with the flourless chocolate cake it was served with.", "author": "C Y."}

Their food is good, it's just not \"$300 per couple good\". We started with the scallop appetizer, which was petite in portion and average in flavor. My wife had the pork loin and I had the lamb t-bone. Again, both were fine, but didn't distinguish themselves from food at half their price. The service was good and the setting is lovely. If the price was cut by half, I'd give it 4 Stars. But at the prices they charge, they don't warrant more than 2.

We took a large group of clients here and had a relatively good experience. While the restaurant has great ambiance and is very clean, the food I would rate at a 3/5 stars. \n\nWe ordered many items on the menu. Here is what I got:\n\n- Crab soup (soup of the day) - $10 - very delicious, but the soup was a bit water-y. Also, there was barely any crab given.\n- Kobe Steak $26 - I ordered medium rare, but it came pretty rare. It was so chewy that it was very difficult to swallow. I would not recommend getting it again. The potato and greens that came with it were much better.\n- Sodas are not free refills (just FYI) - ended up paying $22 for about 6 sodas - they don't warn you of this either\n- Scallops - very small portions unfortunately. We ordered one for everybody.\n\nOverall, the experience was great, but the food was lacking, especially at over $40 a person.

The techniques and flavors are there. The chefs definitely deserve the recognition.  Improving the service and other peripherals like bread and butter can push this restaurant even higher, but that's really not necessary.

Turns out, this is the best dish of the night. Very tender and well timed lobster in tender hotaru squid with herbal white sauce. Legs fried to perfection with clean batter that doesn't get in the way.\n\nQuail:\nvery meaty and tender quail legs. Crispy, not over sweetened teriyaki glazing. Nicely done. \n\nTuna tartar:\nThe tuna is very fresh and chunky. Although looked normal, I liked the cured kumquat and zesty sauce with hint of paprika or bell pepper making it interesting.\n\nSea scallop:\nVery tender scallop. Nicely sauteed but not too surprising. What really hit me was the brandade croquette. Very nice texture and so clean that I cannot believe it's fried.\n\nLamb T-bone (entree):\nMedium rare. Tender, not gamy. Delicious, but not exceptional.\n\nDirty Girl Alpine Strawberry:\nI'm not a dessert person, but the strawberries were nicely cured. And not over sweeten.", "author": "Lance C."}

Fortunately a friend and I were in the area one lovely Friday night and decided to head in. We didn't keep our hopes up though since I knew that this was a one Michelin star place and I assumed that we would probably need reservations. Well. FALSE. We didn't! Wow we got lucky enough to actually get a seat in about twenty minutes or so? They didn't have any tables so we got seated at the chef's bar which I honestly thought was an awesome place to sit because you got to watch the chef's prepare everything and that was a pretty sick experience if you ask me.\n\nWe ordered sea scallops, the halibut, quail, and and the meringue for dessert.\n\nSea scallops--great presentation but nothing special... we sat in front of the chefs that were preparing the appetizers so I really got to see the different types of presentations for the dishes. Sea scallops were good scallops but a bit on the flavorless side. \n\nThe halibut--ugh. This was a disappointment. We had chosen the halibut because it was highly recommended but it ended up just being insanely dry. I didn't even finish my portion. \n\nQuail--this was exciting and so wonderful. Different parts of quail all fried and oh goodness oh so yummy. The peach fritters also complimented the dish very well.\n\nMeringue--my friend and I are not extremely versed in the world of fine dining, so in all honesty, we were pretty confused as to what the meringue actually was. It honestly just looked and tasted like a giant marshmallow. Peaches were good, but I would have to say that the sorbet was the most redeeming part. Should probably just go with the sorbet in the future.\n\nAll in all, a really solid experience with great service. Despite the place being busy, the waiters were very accommodating and honestly I was just thrilled that we were able to get a seat for dinner on a Friday night. A solid 4-star restaurant. Not a 5 because I feel like a 5-star restaurant has to blow your mind. This place had decent food, but nothing extraordinary. It has great ambience though and is definitely worth a go at least once.\n\n\ntldr; solid restaurant if you need to go somewhere a bit on the nicer side", "author": "Jasmine X."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-06", "description": "Just finished a meal here and I'm neither disappointed, nor on cloud 9, hence \"a-ok\" 3 stars. Service here is spot on, I am blanking on his name but we were taken care of by a bald man with glasses and a goatee who was very warm, funny, and easy-going.\n\nWe were a bit late, but seated promptly. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, at a table right in front of the ramp, most likely as a bit of the slap on the wrist for being late (there were plenty of other tables open). No matter, I took the seat closest to the ramp so that my parents could sit peacefully towards the inside of the dining area. As i predicted, one of the bussers with a goatee bumped into me almost every time he went down the ramp, knocking me with extra chairs, a tray, his arm, etc. He also bumped into my dad once. While the restaurant was busier than normal (Fleet Week, Giants Game, 49ers Game, Madonna concert, etc.) and I'm sure he was tired, it was kind of excessive. We ended up moving the table backwards towards the dining about half a foot, problem solved. They should considering just making that table a table for two, instead of three.\n\nWe had the heirloom tomato mozzarella salad, ravioli, and ahi tuna (in order of preference). Of these, the heirloom tomato salad was the winner by a long shot. The quinoa was phenomenal, and I've never had it prepared like that. The mozzarella was quite creamy and the tomatoes were very juicy and fresh! The ravioli was the next best thing, which usually comes with 1 rabbit piece and 2 wild greens and ricotta pieces, but since there were three of us and we were sharing, the waiter suggested we add an additional rabbit piece. The rabbit piece was very nice, much better than the greens/ricotta. Finally the ahi we could have (and should have!) done without, as the texture was just so strange. It looked (and tasted..?) like worms! We would have much preferred it to have been cubed or sliced.\n\nFor the mains, we had the halibut, lamb t-bone, and quail (in order of preference). My halibut was slightly overdone, but the white tomato risotto underneath was just right. It came with a single squash blossom stuffed with rock shrimp and fennel, I wish they could have given me another! The lamb usually comes medium rare but we were asked if this was okay, and we asked for it medium. It came out about half way in between both, and tasted a little gamy. The purple potatoes were very nice though. The quail was also very gamy, and overcooked. We were told this one comes at a specific temperature (which we were fine with), otherwise it tastes like liver. Well, it did end up tasting like liver, so if you are upset about the foie gras ban you should definitely come here, order the quail, and ask for it overcooked. \n\nAt this point of the meal I was actually still hungry, because the portions were so small. I think I preferred the small portions because nothing was that amazing, but I would have otherwise been disappointed if it was much better and still small.\n\nFinally for dessert, we had the chocolate marshmallow pie, the sticky toffee sundae, and the house sent us chocolate hazelnut bonbons as we were celebrating a birthday. The dessert was the best part of the meal, phenomenal! Don't let the medjool date cake turn you off, I like dates, but thought the cake would be some type of weird health freak thing, but it was delicious and didn't really taste like dates. We couldn't decide which dessert was better but they were both very good. Jessica Sullivan, you are an amazing pastry chef!\n\nWeaver's decaf coffee was very smooth and the cappuccino also very nice.\n\nAll in all, I don't think that I would return or particularly recommend this place, but I don't regret coming here either.", "author": "Dahlia S."}

It's basically just slices of Kobe beef.  The crispy potato was essentially a twice baked potato.  It was just perfectly crispy on the outside, with the inside stuffed potato part nice and smooth.  Someone else ordered the scallops appetizer, but asked for a lunch size portion - which is something they can apparently do.  She always gets this item because she likes it so much.  There was also a swordfish and Ahi tuna ordered.  Everyone enjoyed their food.\n\nWe ordered a few desserts.  I ordered the Pecan cake because when I asked the server if I should get that or the pot de creme, she couldn't have said pecan cake fast enough.  Someone else ordered two bon bons.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "I am revising my earlier review (see below) from three stars to four based on a recent visit for lunch. The food was excellent and the server attentive and competent.\nThis time the problem was in the bar.\nPerspective: last time (see earlier review) we arrived early before being joined by the couple we had invited, and sat in the bar, a few feet from the bartender, but he did not seem very interested in providing us with drinks after we ordered them. Lethargic bar service.\nFast forward to the recent lunch: again the bartender has no sense of service. We asked for two glasses of champagne to accompany our starters but the food arrived and had been consumed by the time the bartender could respond (the server saw the problem and apologized, but it was not her fault). Again, lethargic bar service.\nIt may be that the bar is understaffed and overwhelmed (this was a weekday and the place was busy but not too crowded). But the old saying applies: once is an accident, twice is coincidence. Three times? That should never happen in a Chronicle 100 restaurant.\nOur meal was made less pleasant by the presence of a Very Important Person sitting behind me, who kept jolting his chair against mine, even after I moved the table and my wife's chair and my own further away. To make up for it, he left his crossed leg dangling in the serving aisle and made it difficult for servers to get around him. But he is Very Important and we should all be bowing, scraping and telling him how wonderful he is. I mentioned this to our server and told her that I understood her problem: one can't ask such a person to be more considerate of others. Consideration is for the little people. Very Important? Sure. If you don't believe me, ask him.\n\nMost of us, unless we are wealthy, dine out only occasionally for a special event. We want a great experience at a great restaurant. We expect, above all, good value and we must necessarily consider the prices.\nHaving dined at Boulevard some years back, my wife and I, with guests, were looking forward to returning and were prepared for that great experience and good value once more.  We particularly liked the ambiance of the place, intact, though the brick ceiling added to the noise levels.\nService was rushed but competent. The wines we chose, by the glass and bottle, were excellent. My quail main course was exceptional--tender, moist and perfectly prepared. I had hoped for sides of some sort, but none were offered.\nOn the other hand . . .\nAt around $20 for starters and $30+ for main courses, this is an expensive restaurant. One offering was a three-ounce strip steak. Yes, just three ounces, prepared no doubt by scalpel. The tiny portions do not warrant these prices. It's not just a matter of value, it''s appetite too.\nAnd . . .\nThe greatest disappointment was a detail, but an important one. I ordered the crab and artichoke bisque, and it was pleasant except for that detail. It came barely warm and was served in a cold bowl, so that it was tepid in seconds. After that, I touched the plates of all the other servings on the table as they came out: same thing, cold plates. No risk of our food remaining even warm, despite the few mouthfuls of food.\nGod and the devil, we have been told, are in the details.", "author": "John J."}

Overall, a fantastic meal, I thoroughly enjoyed every dish but some were clear favorites over others. One thing that I particularly noticed about Boulevard is that every dish was paired with just the right reduction, accompaniments, and sides. It is very clear that they've put a lot of thought and consideration into every dish and how the flavors really come together and what complements it.\n\nAHI TUNA CRUDO - 5 stars, if you like raw fish, you'll love this dish. Fresh, flavored just right, absolutely perfect and I can't wait to come back to eat it again!\n\nCRISPY KONA ABALONE & HAMACHI TARTARE - 3.5 stars, very delicious, albeit a tad spicy (which I did not expect), but I couldn't tell what I was eating (was that abalone or hamachi or something else?) except for a combination of flavors that worked well but did overpower the seafood just a tad bit.\n\nSEA SCALLOPS - 5 stars, seared just right and paired nicely with a non-conventional \"polenta\" that works just right. Loved the scallops especially, fresh and delicious.\n\nSEARED FOIE GRAS - 5 stars. FANTASTIC. I absolutely adored this dish SO much, especially after the long hiatus from foie gras due to the California ban. This was one of the main reasons I wanted to come here. They seared it just ever so lightly to perfection and everything alongside it was fabulous. \n\nBRENT WOLFE KING QUAIL - 5 stars. Wow, this is probably the best quail I've ever had. Extremely fresh and just beautifully flavored and done just right. This dish was recommended by our server and we were glad we went with her suggestion!\n\nCALIFORNIA LAMB T-BONE - 5 stars. Again, extremely fresh meat, done just right, perfectly flavored. Another fantastic dish.\n\nSEA BASS - 3 stars. I was actually really looking forward to this dish and whereas it was still a good dish, it just wasn't as strong as the other ones and felt more like a generic filet that I could've had at another restaurant. This is probably the sole reason why I didn't give Boulevard an overall 5 star rating. I think I was expecting something more special and it was more of a pleasant but generic dish in the end.\n\nWINTER SYMPHONY CRISP - 4 stars. I'm not a fruit-dessert type of person but was pleasantly surprised by how much I actually liked this one.\n\nCHERRY BROWNIE BON BON - 3.5 stars. Was also really looking forward to this one because I love chocolate and cherry. It was very good but I wish the cherry was a bit more pronounced rather than a subtle hint of it that left me looking for more.\n\nDRINKS (non-alcoholic) - Special lemonade was very good, but my favorite was the one with ginger beer and some type of fruit but the name escapes me. Absolutely refreshing and delicious.\n\nOverall, great dining experience. Service was impeccable. Food was fantastic. Had a great first time here and am looking forward to dining here again.", "author": "H I."}

They gave us a lovely table, brought water and drinks right away, answered questions, and then disappeared except to bring our food exactly when they should have. There was no fussy rearranging of spoons, etc which can be a problem when eating someplace fancy.\n\nDrinks: Yeah, absolutely get a cocktail.  I am generally not a cocktail kind of person, but they looked really interesting...and this is just sort of a cocktail place. Glad I did as they were unique and delicious. \n\nAppetizers: We had calamari and ahi tuna. The tuna was the winner. Wow. Husband is a sashimi purist, but he agreed that this was amazing. The calamari was good but not as memorable as the tuna.\n\nMains: I had swordfish, and he had pork. Both were well thought out (visually, texturally, flavors, etc., ) beautifully presented and perfectly cooked. \n\nDesserts: Get the butterscotch pudding. I didn't love the ginger cake. \n\nWas this the best meal Ive ever had in SF? No. That one was at Masa's back when Julian Serrano was there ( and that was a long time ago)  but it was definitely among the top 3. \n\nThis is a really good choice for a special occasion.", "author": "El B."}

I had always felt it was too stuffy, overworked and really just a place for tourists with more money than food sense.\n\n \n\nWithout giving it all away,  here is our night!\n\n \n\n We had 7:30 reservations, so of course we were seated not-so-promptly at 8:00pm. Once seated we were totally ignored. Even in jail they give you Bread & Water quicker than this! I also had brought a nice bottle of Cakebread Cab to celebrate the evening. When the server FINALLY worked his way to our table he was incredibly smug in the way he told me about the corkage fee (an obnoxious $35, but I knew that going in and was fine with it). One of us asked about a glass of Moscato, and the server said he would go check if they had it and bring the bottle back. Like a magicians rabbit, he disappeared....again! Oh, the bread finally came! Must say, they have awesome bread, too bad we had to wait 30 min for it!\n\nThank goodness we had a lot of catching up to do, because by the time \"later-waiter\" showed back up for our app order another 20 min had passed. Quick comment about the menu, PREDICTABLE! This menu is completely devoid of inspiration &  innovation. The Ahi Tuna Pokie looked like it came from the Bristol Farms Pokie Salad Bar-AFTER they dumped more dressing on it. The Carbonara pasta came all clumped together (way too starchy) and could easily pass for Olive garden fare. The Scallops were decent, but then again, can you really mess up scallops? I was shocked that they did not have a Beet Salad! bet they fix that soon...\n\n \n\nI always feel a little strange pouring my own wine in a \"fine dining \" establishment, but the MIA Server was not gonna do it! So self serve it was!\n\n \n\nThe mains came out! Again, Chain Restaurant fare at Boulevard prices! Yum!  \n\nI looked around, the place was packed! This place must have a shrine in the back to SFO international, because like lemmings, the tourists keep pouring in....Julie & I got dessert only because we decided we should go out in style since this will be our last visit EVER to Boulevard, the most pretentious, over-rated, over-worked, uninspired restaurant in all of San Francisco!\n\nI wonder if people get extra frequent flyer miles for eating here?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n\n\n--", "author": "glenn w."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-03-03", "description": "I'll preface this by saying that I very, very, rarely come to restaurants in this price tier, for the simple reason that, over the years, I've been convinced that the $10/$30/$10  three course dinner marks the point of diminishing returns. Dishes generally don't become significantly more amazing afterwards - one is generally paying for things like hospitality and ambiance by that point, which means little to me next to the quality of the dishes. So, that said, I came to Boulevard to join two friends who had prior plans here, figuring it'd be worth a try, given the rave reviews I'd heard.\n\nAfter two of us ordered some cocktails to start, we ended up going with a crab salad, foie gras, and lobster for starters; duck, pork,and lamb for entrees; and finished off with an ice cream cake and seven layer bar. Without going into particulars (I can't remember details now anymore, anyway), all the dishes were good, but not stellar, and certainly not better than places like Marlowe, Zero Zero, or Frascati, which all fall into lower price tiers. In fact, the only things that stood out here were the desserts, which were actually quite tasty, and the cocktails, which were made rather well.\n\nUnfortunately, while the food itself was not bad, at around $80-90 per person after tax and tip, I can't see myself coming back, considering that's worth two amazing meals elsewhere. Well, no, I suppose I can see myself coming back just for their dessert - yes, they're that tasty - and, for that, they get 2.5 stars from me.\n\nService, while not as wowing as some restaurants I've been to in this price tier, was pretty good. Also, be aware that, for those in wheelchairs, the accessible entrance is actually via a side door (they'll show you the way, once you make them aware).", "author": "Johnny W."}

I will be happy to return when I am in San Francisco again.  \n\nThe service was prompt, efficient, friendly and professional.  \n\nThe wine list is phenomenal, like mind blowingly phenomenal.  The sommelier, Eric, selected two excellent bottles of Burgundy for us based upon my description of what we were looking for that evening.  And, while a little pricey they didn't break the bank.\n\nThe food was almost perfect, almost which is why I am giving four stars and not five.  The Hudson Valley Foie Gras was beyond reproach.  We had two people at our table who truly do not like offal but they wanted seconds of the Foie Gras.  I tasted the Halibut and Riso al Salto and both were perfectly prepared and seasoned.  I saw the Berkshire Kurobuta Pork Prime Rib Chop and if it is true that you eat with your eyes first I was full at the first glance.  I ordered the California Lamb T-Bone and the potatoes, romanesco squash blossom baba ganoush and the lamb jus were excellent but the lamb itself kind of missed the mark.  It was recommended by the server to be prepared medium rare but it came out very rare.  I normally don't mind very rare meat but with the lamb it was just kind of chewy.  It was not displeasing to the taste, and the sear was nice, but it disappointing from the perspective that when I go out for a spendy meal at a Michelin Star rated restaurant I expect them to nail the meat temperatures every single time.  So, while it may seem harsh, I am knocking them down from 5 to 4 stars based upon that (I would prefer to do 4.5 stars but yelp* does not allow for that).\n\nNow the deserts were, once again, irreproachable.  The \"Sticky Caramel Toffee Pudding\" was decadent and delicious and the I can only describe the Cherry Buckle as redonkulously good.   Seriously, it was incredible.

It was filled with diners and seems like a great date night or family dinner venue.\n\nMy general feeling is that the appetizers were very delicious but quite overpriced for the portions. We tried the lobster ravioli, which turned out to be my favorite, but I was disappointed and shocked to find that only 3 pieces of ravioli came out. They weren't even big pieces! However, each bite was indeed delicious and filled with lobster. Was the dish worth ~$20 though? I wouldn't say so...\n\nAnother appetizer we tried was the witches hat with uni. This was a very cute dish and although I'm not typically an uni person, even I found this dish pretty tasty. The witches hats were also very cute and it was my first time eating them - they tasted a lot like wood ear (as I'm typing this, I realize how weirdly named these foods are). \n\nFor my entree, I had the swordfish and risotto, which I did feel was worth the money (~$30). It was light and refreshing and the portion was fair. \n\nThe desserts are a steal! Each dish is around $10 each and very delicious.

That's saying a lot because I'd give the other restaurants we went to on the trip 4-5 stars also.\n\nwe ordered 3 apps and a main to share and the waitress asked if we wanted it to all come out or if we wanted each dish to be split up so that it can be coursed out. Since we didn't have too much planned for the night, we opted for each dish to come out separate and the waitress and kitchen did an extraordinary job at pacing the dinner and timing each dish. I really give extremely high marks on the wait staff, she was very attentive and always made her presence and attention accessible but without being in our face or getting in our way. The waitress just did exactly as you wanted and never forgot a thing, she really made our experience very pleasurable. She also gave great recommendations based off what we liked which is always a plus\n\nThe appetizers just blew our hats off to start the meal. We started with:\n\nBeef Carpaccio with fried oysters, topped with house made hollandaise. This was a decadent, rich and flavorful dish. At first taste you get an amazing creamy and smooth rich texture, but balanced with crispy crunch and fresh citrus bite to the dish. The dish was definitely thought out and balanced well.\n\nLobster/Shrimp ravioli was our next dish and was equally amazing. You can taste every layer of flavor in this dish when you bite into each ravioli. The ravioli dough had the perfect chew that you get from fresh made pasta, and the stuffing was perfectly seasoned. I felt like I had an ocean of shrimp and lobster flavor in my mouth. But to put this dish over the edge, it came with a browned butter sauce on top and underneath it was a sweet corn pudding that just went so well with the rest of the dish. Again perfect balance, and each ingredient played on each other so well. The sweetness of the corn really brought out the sweetness of the seafood stuffing.\n\nThe next dish was a homemade tagliatelle with truffle (Not truffle oil, they had real shaved truffles). This dish was very good but it unfortunately was overshadowed by the first 2...I think that if this had came out first, it would've had a different impact on the meal. It was still great pasta dish, it was just underwhelming after the first 2 courses we had.\n\nWe then got the Lamb T-bone which was a braised fall off the bone lamb. It didn't have any lamb funk to it which I appreciated. And again, this was another one of those dishes that just seemed to have gotten a lot of attention and thought before it was even put on the menu. The little fingerling potatoes and the side nuts and cauliflower salad just went so well with the lamb. Every bite had to take a little of everything in it. The rich moist and tender juicy lamb, with soft potatoes with the crunch of the hazelnuts and cauliflower and vinaigrette...i mean, seriously?\n\nWe finished the meal with their \"ICE box cake\". My first thought when I bit into this dessert was that if a tiramisu met a chocolate covered frozen banana and had a kid...it would probably be  this dessert. So yeah, it was good.\n\nGreat restaurant, highly recommended for a nice night out.", "author": "Calvin C."}

The dish was very good but fell a little short in my opinion.  I can see and appreciate the thought process that went into the dish, having a bunch of contrasting flavors and textures to play off the richness of the fois gras, personally I didn't like the spiced chocolate toast.  I thought the toast was way to big and I wasn't sold on the flavor of it was kind of bitter and chalky in flavor and texture.  The size of it also made int difficult to shave a piece off the whole and get a bit of it, the fois gras and everything together.  When I could the balance was nice...but that only happened 2-3 times.  Less could have been more...especially at $30 for an appetizer. http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/xaaVVhZv97illMU8Pbk93A/l.jpg\n\nENTREE\n\nOven Roasted Lamb Prime T-Bone - 3 out of 5 - Lamb T-bone that is oven roasted and served OFF the bone with crushed potatoes, sauted chard, broccoli romanesco, tokyo turnips and a rosemary lamb jus.  The lamb was very well cooked but lacking in a bit of seasoning and overall flavor.  I really wanted to like it but ended up thinking all the other sides on the dish packed a lot more flavor than the lamb.  http://s3-media4.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/r4WGq0rDiJS-oqqls1FUzw/l.jpg\n\nDESSERT\n\nDreamcile Brulee  - 4 out of 5 - Vanilla custard topped with mandarine oranges brulee  served with a tart sherbet \"ice cream sandwich.\" The highlight of the evening.

He was a finicky eater, so we knew it had to be pretty decent.  He used to rack up $60+ alone, so we knew we were in for a bit of a splurge too.\n\nWe decided to drop in one day midweek for a lunch.  The place gets pretty busy, and most of the patrons were in business attire and the conversations were revolved around work.  The reception staff was nice, but without a reservation we were quickly seated at a tiny table in the corner.  Not a big deal, but there wasn't much elbow room.  Our server was nice and attentive.\n\nWe went for two nonalcoholic drinks (black current french soda, so good!) one lobster bisque, the crab cake appetizer, the seared scallops entree, and the oven roasted sirloin steak.  \n\nOverall the food was pretty good, although a bit on the salty side.  It started out with the bread and butter.  The butter was lightly salted.  Then the bisque came and that was delicious the first few bites, but then the salt started taking over.  By the time we finished up the crab cake and moved onto the main lunch entrees, we were also halfway through our drinks--I was combating the increased thirst with my supplemental ice water.  \n\nThe scallops and the steak weren't extraordinary, but were still quite good for lunch fare.  The steak portion was pretty fair, enough to definitely fill one up if they've already had an appetizer.  The meat was extremely tender, though somewhat lacking in flavor.  The scallops were good, but there were only four medium sized scallops with some beans, bacon and sauce around them.  Definitely nowhere near a large enough portion.  I could have easily had another plate of four scallops before getting satiated.\n\nWe ended the lunch with two coffees and tried two of their ice cream scoops.  The vanilla was particularly good and helped to cap the meal and take the salt edge away.  Overall the lunch was north of $100 for two people.  A good experience, but we'll likely only be back for special occasions or parties.", "author": "Al C."}

The ambiance is ok - kind of loud & more casual than I expected.  They did give us a really cute little 2-person booth so we could sit side by side looking out on the dining room - that was cool.   The bread is average but they did have good butter topped with sea salt.\n\nMy husband had the lamb t-bone ($37), which he enjoyed.  It came with a variety of interesting sides including grapes, cauliflower & purple potatoes.   I had the local petrole sole ($30) with crispy kale, porcini butter, pecans & lemon. The sides were good (if a bit salty) but the fish was not great.  It didn't taste like other sole dishes I've had before which were light and flaky; it was a very dense, chewy piece of fish and a very thick fillet (I'm confused about how it was so thick because sole is such a thin fish).  It tasted more like swordfish (which I don't really like) than it did like other sole dishes I've had in the past.  So that was a disappointment.  \n\nI was really excited to have their flourless chocolate cake & olive oil ice cream ($11.50) for dessert - I love flourless chocolate cake & really wanted to try olive oil ice cream.  The dish was beautifully plated and had a lot going on (in addition to the cake and ice cream there were chocolate pistacho truffles, caramel rice krispies, olive oil powder, olive oil gum drops and a chocolate mousse wrapped in a chocolate shell) but didn't wow me.  The \"flourless\" cake didn't have the dense, fudgy flavor I normally associate with such cakes - it was light and spongy and tasted more like a cake-like brownie that didn't have a particularly strong chocolate flavor.  The ice cream had a good creamy consistency but I didn't get much olive oil flavor (maybe this is common for olive oil ice cream? I've never had it before) and it basically tasted like vanilla ice cream.  The other things on the dessert plate were similarly lacking in flavor; my favorite part was probably the chocolate mousse.   \n\nService was very friendly.  We did not get any amuses or treats with the bill.  4% SF health insurance service charge.  The menu in the restaurant matches the one on line, except the prices are mostly a dollar or so higher (pet peeve of mine) . There is a valet for $15 or you can find street parking (we found free parking with no problem, but we were there on a Sunday).", "author": "A M."}

If you're a fish fan at all, this is a must-try.  The waiter recommended it as one of his favorite menu items too... and I was just about to order the salmon!  The potatoes on the side were good but the star was definitely the fish.  Meaty but light and flaky, and the lemon and garlic aioli was the perfect complement to the light entree.\n\nwe also had the abalone appetizer with pork riblets which was very very tasty.  A little heavy for an appetizer for me but PACKED full of flavor.\n\nWith drinks and a shared appetizer and the entree I think it came out to be about $85/person, which isn't an everyday dinner price but definitely worth it if you're looking for a treat!", "author": "Kelsey H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-04", "description": "My wife took me to Boulevard for a birthday dinner. We rushed against traffic and then couldn't find parking--luckily they were able to hold our reservation, because we were quite a bit later than the customary 15 minutes. We ordered the following:\n\n- Sea scallops, brandade croquette, choron bernaise sauce, tomato lime relish & garlic chips\nIt's hard not to love sea scallops--these were no exception. Light creamy sauce, delicious fried croquette (like an actually yummy version of a tater tot). My only critique is that the little garnishing leaves on top had no distinct flavor, whereas the best dishes consider every aspect, and the tiniest leaf is meant to evoke a particular flavor so as to balance the dish.\n\n- Roasted beet salad, jeune autize goat's milk morbier cheese, pickled cauliflower, caper sultana raisinette\nI love beets, and these were wonderful, especially the smaller lighter colored ones that I thought would be tomatoes. The cheese was a great balancer for savory and creamy. The pickled cauliflower was good, but not pickled long enough and not big enough. Once again, the leaves used in garnish were flavorless, and we felt that golden raisins were unnecessary due to the inherent sweetness of the beets. Still, it was really great.\n\n- Eden valley berkshire (kurobuta) pork prime rib chop (wood oven roasted), anson mills heritage polenta & biellese lardo, italian pine nut & saba pearl relish, roasted blueberries, napa cabbage with colatura, roasted pork jus\nMy wife works with a lot of really rich doctors who head up Kaiser's management board--they love fine dining and speak of it often. One such doctor said that Boulevard was one of his favorites, and that the pork chop was his \"last meal\". So it was with this introduction that we partook. I mean, it was wonderful (and I don't even like pork chops generally), but I'd challenge this as being \"last meal\" quality. It was a really great cut of meat, no gamey flavor or gristle chunks, but it needed a little sauce of some sort. I don't really remember what that little polenta cake with the lardo tasted like, but I'm sure it was decent. The pine nuts needed a good toasting. The best part of the dish was the roasted blueberries--hard to argue with that.\n\n- California lamb t-bone (wood oven roasted, served off the bone), grilled monterey artichoke, carrot & beldi olive panzanella with our pancetta, mixed farros with creamed artichoke, cynar lamb jus, mint & orange\nOnce again, great cut of meat, not lamby at all--the sauce was rather normal, brownish, and not awe-inspiring. The artichoke was good (as all artichokes are), but nothing about the presentation or flavor surprised me. I did like the farros with creamed artichoke, very unique and managed to taste healthy and creamy simultaneously.\n\n- Dirty girl alpine strawberries, brown suger sour cream mousse, almond brown butter biscuit, strawberry \"pudding\", balsamic vinegar gelee\nThis dish had so much potential, but the strawberries were quite sour, as was the sour cream mousse (not enough brown sugar?). Biscuits--boring and soggy. It could've been so beautiful.\n\n- Flourless chocolate cake, olive oil ice cream & gummies, pistachio truffles, caramel brown rice crispies\nThe waitress swore the chocolate cake was light--she was wrong. It was rich and yet dry, with what tasted like odorless flour on top. But whatever the heck that chocolate thing on the left was, it was amazingly moist and potent. The crown jewel of this dish was the olive oil ice cream! I never dreamt of something so magnificent.\n\nAll in all:\n\nIt was quality--not Gary Danko or Coi quality, but certainly Michelin star quality.

Boulevard has always been our gold standard for a bistro....up until now.\n\nNo longer.\n\nFoie gras hadn't been cleaned properly. Oversalted and overpriced, although the combo of fresh cranberries beat sibling Prospect's attempt at foie gras with grapes a few months prior.\n\nLobster ravioli: adequate but not exciting. Thick pasta shell somewhat overwhelmed the delicate lobster, and a foam sauce?!? Blech.\n\nVeal 'schnitzel' with sweetbreads was a muddled concept of too many ingredients and some sour flavors that were completely inappropos with the delicate flavor of sweetbreads. Waiter's description of dish was inaccurate, a first here.\n\nRed abalone starter tasted brined, it was so salty. And the two delicate little slices of abalone disappeared into the messy cioppino-like concept.\n\nLamb T-bone was lovely as were the beautiful vegetable sides of sauteed chard with colatura (salted anchovies) was good, as were the baby Romanesco broccoli and halved baby turnips. But the mashed Yukon Gold potatoes with nettles and Parmesan were ridiculously salty, even for my DH who loves salt. \n\nKing salmon was accompanied by a too salty wilted spinach salad. It's the first time we have ever encountered so much salt used in Boulevard's kitchen.\n\nBut worse was to come. The dessert was terrible. The chocolate bombe was sickeningly sweet and the chestnut ice cream was awful. \n\nAnd the bill? Well, let's just say that this dinner cost us precisely what it cost us to go to La Folie - except of course, the food at La Folie is ALWAYS perfect. \n\nWhen Ravi Kapur left, apparently the balance, creativity, and flawless execution went with him. The dishes were overwrought and poorly executed, where all the beautiful ingredients failed to combine into a masterful whole.\n\nIt will be a long, long time before we come back to Boulevard or Prospect.

The seared foie gras appetizer was cooked perfectly and the accompaniments helped cut the richness of the goose live.  The seared scallops and tuna tartare were good but very standard preparations.  The lamb chop, steak and lamb entrees were all seared cooked to the right temperatures, tender and juicy.  I thought the standout for the evening was definitely the desserts.  The cinnamon bon bons and flour-less chocolate cake were outstanding.  \n\nMy only gripe is with the staff at the host stand.  They were too busy chatting amongst themselves to greet me or to offer coat check for my overcoat.  After meeting up with my cousins and sister at the bar, since our table was not yet ready, I realized neither were they as everyone still had their coats with them.  I initially thought that they really didn't have a coat check until I saw a closet full of jackets near our table.  Good thing our waiter didn't share the same work ethic as the hosts, he provided great service throughout the evening and made the experience enjoyable.  \n\nOverall Boulevard provides solid food and service for the most part, but quite pricey for what you are getting.", "author": "Wei K."}

First thing i notice is how beautiful the ceilings are, and really just the restaurant in general.  Second thing i notice is the amazing service.  They were there to greet us right when we walked in, and we were seated promptly.  From the moment we sat down to the moment we left, we received amazing service.  the servers were polite and knowledgeable.  They were there when you wanted them, and not there when you didn't.\n\nFood:\n\nScallops - were amazing.  the scallops themselves were perfectly seared on the outside and tender and flavorful inside.  The mix of veggies and/or fruits that was served with it was almost as good as the scallops themselves.\n\nRed Abolone - First time eating abalone and i have no complaints.  Was coated in amaranth seeds and what seemed like a chickpea batter, but i could be wrong on that.  was served with delicious asparagus and on top of some type of pureed salsa verde sauce which was delicious.  my only complaint is that the salsa kind of overpowered the abalone a tad.\n\nBurrata and squash blossom ravioli with shaved white truffles:  hands down the best thing we ate.  It was homemade pasta, and it had squash blossoms and burrata......and truffles....what more do you need to say?\n\nSea Bass - Done up with capers and lemon and served with favas, beech mushrooms, and a purple potato and on top of some really amazing asparagus.   It was a really good dish overall BUT i have had better cuts of sea bass.   it tasted fresh, and all of the flavors on the plate worked really well, but i didnt think that the actual sea bass had a ton of flavor.   The texture was slightly off too.  It was a little mushy, ie - it didnt exactly flake off when you put your fork in it, rather the flakes sort of disintegrated when you put your fork to it.  \n\nDesserts:  we all shared desserts.  They were all amazing.  Had chocolate creme pot, some peanut butter thing and a brown sugar crusted angel food cake with rhubarbs.  All were spot on.....albeit rich.\n\nDrinks:  hmmm......love the wine selection.  They were all excellent.  The cocktail program.....eh.  I know they are not known for cocktails, but, being in a city known for cocktails, i feel like they are lagging behind the competition.  Had a cucumber gimlet :-/  Ok, it was a good gimlet, but you can get that anywhere.  The other cocktails on the menu seemed to be total alcohol bombs or WAY too sweet.\n\nAll in all, this is a really solid restaurant.  I would go back, but i dont think i would get fish as an entree.  I have heard that Boulevard is better known for cooking meat as opposed to fish, and i was THIS CLOSE to getting the pork chop.  The only reason i didnt was because it was a nice day in the city, and the pork chop seemed like a really great dish for a cold winter day.  I understand WHY this place is an institution and why it has been here for so long.....long after many restaurants have come and gone.  Its a great place to bring a person who appreciates good food, but may not be the most adventurous eater (like mom or dad, or other family or maybe a business dinner).  But it is great for foodies alike as well.  It has something for everybody.  \n\nBoulevard did not fall short of expecations....nor did it exceed them.", "author": "Christian C."}

The one dessert we had was a major disappointment.\n\nOverall not bad meal but for the price and the hype.. not quite up to expectations.\n\nMUST-HAVES: lobster ravioli, fig & grape salad.\n\n* Service\n5 stars, as expected from an establishment like this. Always prompt, professional.\n\n* AHI TUNA TARTARE - 4 stars\n(Pickled Plum & Wasabi Tobiko, Avocado & Fresh Wasabi Root, Horseradish Rice Cracker, Hodo Soy Tofu & Lemon Ginger Pickles. $17.75)\nReally really nice the way the tuna and avocado interacted. The tuna was fresh and tender. The cracker added some good texture.\n\n* MAINE LOBSTER PYRAMID RAVIOLI - 4.5 stars\n(Lobster Sabayon Sauce, Spicy Tomato Emulsion, Lobster Mushrooms & Opal Basil. $18)\nAmazing. The ravioli was soft, buttery, and the lobster so fresh and full of flavor. Loved this.\n\n* BLACK MISSION FIG & LATE SUMMER GRAPE SALAD - 5 stars\n(Bucheron Goat Cheese, Pistachios & Mixed Organic Lettuces, Fresh Fig Jam with Rosemary & Smoked Salt, Honey & Aged Balsamic Syrup. $14.25)\nLoved this so much! The figs/ greens/ pistachios/ goat cheese/ balsamic went AMAZINGLY together. Absolutely wonderful.\n\n* PAN ROASTED CALIFORNIA WHITE SEA BASS - 3 stars\n(Dungeness Crab & Mussel Beignet, Saffron Aioli, Black Risotto with Shellfish Broth, Roasted & Clarified Tomato Relish with Lemon Olive Oil. $34)\nI had this dish 6 days ago now and I honestly can't remember a thing about it. That must say something.. it certainly wasn't bad, but didn't stand out very much. One thing I do remember was the risotto was just not what I expected (I guess I should've asked what black risotto was like) as it's much like black rice in that it is much harder in texture, and even though it's soaked in a broth, it was somehow dry and bland in flavor.\n\n* WOOD OVEN ROASTED CALIFORNIA LAMB PRIME T-BONE WOOD OVEN ROASTED ON THE BONE, SERVED OFF THE BONE - 3 stars\n(Hand Rolled Fregola Sarda, Market Squash & Ricotta Salata, Rossa Bianca Eggplant with Roasted Tomato & Grilled Padron Peppers, Almonds & Castelvetrano Olives, Lamb Jus & Roasted Red Pepper Sauce. $37)\nWhile the lamb was really good, I've definitely had more tender steaks, especially at this price range. I don't remember much else about this dish so nothing really stood out about it.\n\n* STRAWBERRY WATERMELON ICE CREAM CAKE - 2 stars\n(Layers of Double Strawberry Ice Cream, Vanilla Chiffon Cake, Watermelon Sorbet, Orange Blossom Scented Cream, Vanilla Wafer Crust, Strawberry Pate de Fruit. $11)\nSomehow my friends liked this, but I thought this dessert was SO cheap looking (and tasting!). For a restaurant of this caliber, I think frozen fruits are a huge no-no, and this cake was CLEARLY topped with frozen strawberries. The cake just had a weird thick and way too hard texture (like when ice cream has been sitting in the freezer for too long), and I really couldn't distinguish the strawberry/ watermelon/ orange flavors. There was a slice of watermelon on the side.. random, I think more to add to the physical appearance. Plus it wasn't that fresh or sweet either.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

I was living in SF, totally mesmerized by the City. Boulevard was one of the places, like Farallon and Bix, that made San Francisco even more magical, like they were creations of the City and could only exist there.\n\nFast forward to a very, very overdue review...written from Chicago, where I live now, and countless dinners at Boulevard over the years.\n\nMesmerizing. More 'of the City' than I realized back in the day. \n\nI love the floor, the ceiling, the small bar, the lighting, the walls, having to go out the back and then downstairs to the restroom, the way Bay light infuses the place. Instead of big and open, it's long a somewhat narrow except in the back facing the Bay, like a mashup of speakeasy, diner and Orient Express dining car.\n\nThe food still rates 5-stars, a tough act in the restaurant business. So maybe 6- or 7-stars just for staying relevant and worthy.\n\nThe service still rates 5-stars. Discreet, not fawning, timely.\n\nAnd they had a bottle of Elit Vodka in a room behind the bar....not bad because I can't find it anywhere and it is a nice alternative to a Grey Goose or Ciroc dry martini.\n\nHighly recommended, no matter if you're local or visiting.", "author": "Hendrix B."}

We waited at the bar and had some specialty cocktails, which by the way were incredibly made and super strong.

Unfortunate for some yelpers, they apparently did not receive the service they had expected for the price. My experience, however, stands apart from those reviews because of the professional and outstanding service we received upon our visit at Boulevard.\n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess greeted us kindly and wished my gf a happy birthday. We were shown to our table, and our server (good-looking white male in his late twenties, maybe early thirties) kindly approached us. He was extremely helpful with our selection of our courses, as it was our first time dining at Boulevard and we were unfamiliar with the menu. \n\nI did a good amount of research aka reading through yelp reviews so I was warned that portions are on the small side. We ended up trying three appetizers and two entrees. Two appetizers and two mains would have sufficed, because the mains were actually decent sized for french american cuisine. We got the rabbit meat balls which tasted the best although I still can't mentally get over that I ate Bugs Bunny. Also the ahi tartar which consisted of the freshest ahi tuna I have ever tasted in my life, and the veal scallops (tasted good but its slimy texture freaked me out.) After sharing the three appetizers and having one slice of complimentary bread, I was already almost full (I don't eat a lot) so I guess this took away from my entree, the lamb chops, which I enjoyed but barely ate less than half. My girlfriend ordered the pork chop (which was the most popular item on the menu and most reviewed item on yelp) and she couldn't help but finish every last bite because of (I quote) \"how amazing it is.\" \n\nDessert we ordered (butterscotch pudding) came out with a candle and a \"happy birthday\" chocolate plaque. It was sooooo good.\n\nOverall it was a good experience, and I am so glad that service was extremely on point and the food was great. The only reason why I did not rate this restaurant 5 stars is because I recently had both Redd and Bottega in Yountville and I feel that the food was slightly better there.", "author": "Vicky H."}

I ate every last crumb and scraped my plate clean.  We had the fillet mignon and swordfish.  The fillet was served with a steak knife but it truly wasn't needed.  Even using a regular knife that steak was so tender that it cute like butter, I'm not even exaggerating.\n\n2. Jeff H. is an excellent waiter.  He is super knowledgeable about the food and personable.  And of course he, like everyone at Boulevard provided superb service.\n\n3. I have a crush on Ms. Jessica Sullivan even though I've never met her.  She is the pastry chef and her Banana Cream Pie was crazy good (presentation and taste).\n\n4. Since my date and I started the evening at Cliff House and Top of the Mark for cocktails and aps (and wanted to save room for dessert) we didn't get a starter at Boulevard but they brought us a complimentary yummy little plate of black chickpea hummus with baked lavash.\n\n5. Even though the kitchen was open to the restaurant, and the restaurant was at about 95% capacity it wasn't loud.  My bf and I had nice conversation and couldn't hear anyone else's.  Perfect.\n\n6. The decor is interesting.  It looks old but I understand it to be all artisan work done inside the shell of an old building.  Also, the kitchen is open to the dining room which I've always thought to be the sign of a restaurant with good sanitation.  Moreover, in this case, it was fascinating to see a brigade of eight-plus chefs on the line.  \n\n7. When arriving for our reservation, we were promptly seated. The hostess took our coats for us table-side and brought back our coat check number to us.  When we were getting up to leave our coats were quickly brought to us.

They were just opening for lunch, so we got seated very quickly, along with a bunch of other people who had been waiting. Our waiter was very nice. Although he clumsily dropped the menu onto my dish in the beginning. He recommended some appetizers and entrees that just happened to be what we were eyeing, so we ended up getting all his recommendations. We had the seared scallop risotto and ahi tuna tartare as appetizers and the wood oven roasted pork and pan roasted swordfish entrees. My bf liked the fish, but my pork dish was really not that great. I stopped eating halfway through it. We concluded that the scallop risotto was the best out of everything. \n\nDuring my first time here, I got the kobe beef burger and an assortment of appetizers, including the squash blossoms, glazed sea scallops, and carpaccio. They were all good, but overall I felt that the food didn't live up to the expectations that their prices set for me.", "author": "Rose Y."}

Because once my teeth dug into the most tender abalone, once my taste buds became enchanted by the sweetness of a lobster scallop duo, and my senses experienced the most beautifully executed chocolate dessert, there was no turning back. No doubt in our minds, Boulevard deserved the coveted Michelin Star. It was a perfect way to celebrate our first Valentine's together. \n\nPeople believe dropping Benjamins on food that will only take a few minutes to devour is such a waste of hard earned money, but I defiantly disagree. Food of this caliber will resonate with me for life.\n\nMy memorable dishes:\n\nMonterey Red Abalone, Roasted Abalone Mushroom, Clamshell Mushrooms, Chives & Lemon Aioli-Tender, tart, and savory. Whom ever created this dish was very well aware that the taste and texture would create the most satisfying combination. The mushrooms and abalone were so tender that I struggled to distinguish one from the other. The tartiness of the lemon aioli enhanced the overall dish while the chives and fried shallots carried the dish to the finish line, making it not only my first, but favorite entree of the night.\n\nMaine Lobster & Royal Sweet Sea Scallop, Meyer Lemon & Limoncello Risotto, Black Trumpet Mushroom & Crispy Sunchokes, Lemon & Chive-Thus far the most naturally sweet and succulent lobster and scallop I've tasted. The ingredients used really brought out the flavor of the seafood resulting in a lobster and scallop triumph elevated by creamy risotto and crispy sunchokes.\n\nChocolate Macaron with Roasted White Chocolate, Chocolate Mirror Glaze & Chocolate Curls, Truffles, Pressed Pear & Pistachio Tuile, Pistachio Ice Cream-A busy, chaotic masterpiece. Simplicity is overrated and this dessert kept my attention because of its complexity. My eyes couldn't focus on just a single part of the dessert but hopped from the chocolate truffle and macaron, to the ball of pistachio ice cream and scoop of roasted white chocolate laid out on top of a platform of chocolate heaven. I'd love to meet the pastry chef who created such a divine chocolatey treat.\n\nThe quality food, delightful ambiance, top-notch service and let's not forget the cozy love seat booth, all lend to the amazing experience we had at Boulevard. A perfect way to celebrate our first Valentine's and mark the beginning of more great things (and food) to come.", "author": "Nancy L."}

My wife and I were visiting San Francisco a couple of weeks ago and we met up with a bunch of friends for dinner at Boulevard. There were 12 of us in our party (we did make reservations four weeks in advance). \n\nOur table was ready for us when we all arrived and it was spectacular. It was up on a raised section of the restaurant with a beautiful view of the Bay Bridge and the Embarcadero. \n\nWhile the setting was perfect (the decor is classy and tasteful), you can't taste beauty, so on to the food: In a word, it was delicious. You would think that with a huge party and everyone ordering something different, there would be one or two stumbles, but there was not a single one. Everything from the service to the wine list to the food was flawless. My abalone appetizer was amazing. And the pan roasted \"king\" quail was not only rich and succulent, it was filling! Everyone was raving about their dish and at one point, there was a pretty comical scene where we were all swapping plates around the table so that everyone could try a bite of every dish. The Sommelier (Jon) did an amazing job of picking exceptional wines to please a wide range of palates and plates while staying well within our \"budget.\" \n\nI have had the pleasure of dinning around San Francisco over the years and I love Gary Danko and Quince and Frances, but Boulevard is the road to gastronomic happiness!", "author": "Scott G."}

We were with a group and had the 'Le Avenue' room downstairs from the main dining area.\n\nFor starters, the bar personnel couldn't have been more impersonal.  A place like Boulevard and no napkin placed under your drink???  No 'you're welcome' after saying 'thank you'???  These employees must be millennia generation (me, me, me).\n\nKept going down hill from there.  There were very good crab cakes being served as appetizers except there was one problem----you couldn't find any after the first serving!\n\nThen came the dinner starting with what Boulevard considered a salad.  Most tasteless salad I have EVER had.  It had a concoction of some kind of creamed cheese in it with two of the worst tasting tomatoes sitting among lifeless greens and nary any dressing.  Terrible.  Inexcusable for a restaurant that has won so many awards.  Success has spoiled this place.\n\nThe entre was heralded on the menu as \"Angus Filet Mignon\".  Well, this old Angus steer must have been on a Jenny Craig diet before being destined for the dinner table because it was totally void of taste.  Add to the latter that it was dry and you had one unhappy diner.\n\nYou can have this place.  It saw my last dime.", "author": "Peter F."}

Staff was attentive, courteous and very professional.  During cocktails, servers kept wine flowing and the passed hors d'eouvres were delicious -- we had the crab cakes and tuna tartar.   For dinner, we had the Burrata with figs for apps, choice of the pork chop or halibut for entr\u00e9e, and choice of Pear Tatin or Butterscotch Pudding.  Food was good, not great.  We arranged for wines to be paired with the food like a simulated wine pairing so guest didn't have to think about what drink would go well with the food.

Let me start off by saying that we had been told it was a top romantic restaurant in the city and we definitely did not get that impression upon arrival and seating at our table. It felt very much more like an old established restaurant for business lunches and dinners. \nAfter we were seated, I ordered a drink off their specialty menu, only to be told they were out of the blood orange (immediately after being told the entire menu was available). So then I changed my drink to a Cosmo. But once it arrived, I had to send it back (which I never do), because it was just over the top with lime flavor. \nOur first course were the scallops, which were nicely done. Then I ordered the pork chops. I don't understand what previous reviewers were going on about over that dish ... My pork was tough and dry, bordering on inedible. I barely touched them. Luckily my husband's filet mignon was much nicer and he shared with me. \nAfter that experience, we decided to just cut our losses and skip dessert.

That's enough reason to celebrate! haha Food is delicious and everything is so crafted beautifully. It's a pricey penny but it's not unexpected. \n\nWe came here with reservations for a very late reservation of 9:15pm but didn't show up until 9:35pm. I always wondered why people would ever come for dinner that late and now I was one of those people rolling in for a later dinner due to late friends, but oh wells. At least we didn't have to wait. \n\nPer my husband's research, we requested a table in the back near the windows so we could see the view of Embarcadero and the Bay Bridge Lights. Great recommendation and great seats! Good job hubby! :) Our friends loved it as well and were surprised. \n\nI think we already got on the wrong foot with our waiter when my friend wanted a strong drink and was recommended the Mule drink, it wasn't strong enough for her and tasted almost like a lemonade. Oh wells not anyone's fault really, it's a preference. But I think from there our waiter didn't like us and wouldn't chat with us and was very cordial but moved on. He almost had no tolerance to wait on us. \n\nMy husband and I ordered as an appetizer the Porcinis & Crispy Pork Belly to share. Our friend had the King Quail and she said it was delicious. Our shared appetizer was delicious, so many great flavors with the wild rice and the pork belly with the porcinis. However, there was only 2 tiny pieces of pork belly on the entire plate... c'monnnn reeally? I get that it's about quality not quantity. But I barely got to taste the quality with a tiny piece of pork and was hungry for me. Luckily the wild rice kept my stomach happy. \n\nAs for entrees, both the guys got the Porkchop and I ordered the Chicken and my girl-friend got the Lamb. Everyone raved about their food. The porkchop was super thick and was very tender and flavour. My guinea hen was super tender and delicious as well. My friend's lamb was really yum and not gamey. \n\nFor dessert, I got the Apricot Bon-Bon and my husband got the Flourless Chocolate Cake. I liked how the Bon-Bon is a tiny ball and one item, it's nice if you want something sweet but don't want a full plate of sweets. My husband's item of the Flourless Chocolate cake was delicious and there was A LOT going on. There was a scoop of olive oil ice cream, pistachio-crusted truffle, gummies, caramel brown-rice crisps and of course the flourless chocolate cake. All very delicious!!! \n\nAll in all a great meal of course. I would expect no less from a Michelin-star and from the highly raved Boulevard.", "author": "Grace L."}

You do your best to make the right choice and have faith in the restaurant to execute sublimely. Showing up on the day before Valentine's Day to celebrate, I must say this SF classic surely lived up to the expectations and more.\n\nThe night started off with a surprise as we were directed not to a table where we would sit across from each other, but to a loveseat booth along the wall. Didn't know how we were so fortunate to get one of these booths but it was pleasant to see. We were positioned as to see the open kitchen in action which fascinated both of us.\n\nAppetizers:\nMonterey Red Abalone, Roasted Abalone Mushroom, Clamshell Mushrooms, Chives & Lemon Aioli: My lady's dish and while I got only a couple bites of it, the abalone was amazingly tender. The lemon aioli brightened up the umami of the abalone and mushrooms. \n\nLobster Bisque, Lobster & Mussel Fritters, Fresh Prawn & Aioli: Pure, intense lobster flavor. The bisque is poured tableside into the small bowl where a couple fritters and a prawn reside. It was lobster to the umpteenth level. The mussels were plump and juicy and the prawn was succulent. I wish I had more of all of those components.\n\nEntrees:\nMaine Lobster & Royal Sweet Sea Scallop, Meyer Lemon & Limoncello Risotto, Black Trumpet Mushroom & Crispy Sunchokes, Lemon & Chive: The lady's entree was a winner. It was a mixture of textures and flavors. The sweet lobster and scallop. The risotto elevated your tastebuds. The earthiness of the mushroom. The added texture of the sunchokes. It was the entree I had my eye on but I'm glad I chose.....\n\nWood Oven Roasted Heritage Pork Prime Rib Chop, Butterball Potatoes with Parmesan & Crunchy Prosciutto Croutons, Sauteed Swiss Chard with Garlic & Chile Flakes, Smoked Dates & Kumquat, Roasted Pork Jus with Rosemary: A healthy sized pork prime rib chop for a restaurant of this caliber. It was not tough and melted in my mouth with each bite. The potatoes were slightly bland and the swiss chard was a bit salty. The smokey dates were a surprisingly pleasant note to the dish. Reminded me of fruity bacon.\n\nDesserts:\nChocolate Macaron with Roasted White Chocolate, Chocolate Mirror Glaze & Chocolate Curls, Truffles, Pressed Pear & Pistachio Tuile, Pistachio Ice Cream: It's a chocoholic's dessert. I could barely get a couple bites from my lady. But it was decadent and the canele of roasted white chocolate tasted similarly to caramel. \n\nToffee Dusted Doughnuts, Vanilla & Butterscotch Pudding, Cocoa Streusel & Apple Caramel: I'm a doughnut fiend so when I saw this on the menu I had to have it. I enjoyed the toffee coating but the doughnuts were more dense and dry than I would have liked. I'm not a fan of butterscotch but I was happy with the pudding, which you scoop from the bottom of the glass to get all of the layered components. A wonderful ending to a fantastic meal.\n\nI must commend the server and the busboys. They were top notch. The server (I wish I got her name, but she was a blonde haired lady) was very helpful when I had trouble deciding on menu items. She saw my lady's camera on the table and immediately offered to take pics for us which we gladly accepted. When I wanted to see the dessert menu again to get the descriptions of them to later compose this review, she told us she could give us a copy of it. We ended up getting an envelope with the starter, main, AND dessert menus to take home. The busboys were on point with refilling water, offering more bread, taking away plates, and even cracking a joke on how we hated the desserts when he saw our spotlessly clean dessert plates.\n\nMy lady loved the atmosphere, the meal, and thoroughly enjoyed our 1st Valentine's Day together.

Ethan was our waiter, he was attentive, funny and his menu recommendations were right on point. There were four in our party, we started with the Grilled Spanish Octopus & Crisp Monterey Calamari and the Heirloom Tomatoes & Burrata. Delicious! Our main entrees consisted of the Berkshire Chop and the Wolfe King Quail...impeccable!! Dessert followed with the Berry Buckle and Dark Chocolate Tart...divine!! Here is my biggest complaint....(stop reading now if you are not interested) at the end of the evening when the bill came, I had a $100.00 gift card and a $50.00 gift certificate to use towards our meal. Apparently the gift certificate was a voucher, I was completely unaware of the small fine print, (as this was given to me as a birthday gift), I did not realize the voucher had to be redeemed online first before using it in the restaurant. Let's just say it was not very clear. When our fabulous waiter took our bill with all forms of payment, a woman returned, who I am assuming was the manager on duty,(I did not get her name). She was so rude and snippy toward our table. She said \"I don't know what this is, but you cannot use it!\" Her tone, facial expression and attitude turned our wonderful evening into a very awkward moment. I responded to her by stating that I thought it was a gift certificate and in her condescending tone, she responded, \"No! You must redeem this online first!\" She then asked if we wanted to put the remainder of the balance on our credit card, which is of course what we wanted...then she stormed off, ran our bill, returned our bill and did not even look at us. I was so, mortified and let me just say I left there with a very uneasy feeling. I did not like the way she made me feel at all!!! \n\"People will forget what you said.

The food and amazing wine list changed my mind! \n\nOur group ordered a number of dishes, and the standouts were the Ahi Tuna Crudo (seriously amazing and so flavorful), the Swordfish, and the Scallops. Thoughtful and creative combinations of ingredients, beautiful presentation. \n\nOur waitress was wonderful and even threw in a free dessert for our table. \n\nBesides the atmosphere in the back, the only other downside was that it was quite loud and a little difficult to talk over the hubub at times.", "author": "Heather K."}

My friend and I were able to enjoy our conversation with out constant interruptions. \n\nNow the food was amazing, high quality and executed perfectly. I started with the tuna tartare and it was super fresh. The rice cracker and simple sauce was a great addition to the plate without over powering the star of the dish, the tuna! My friend had the gem salad to start and it looked good. Next time it will be the crab salad for me. \n\nI choose the scallops for my main dish and it was great. The buttermilk mashed under each scallop was so tasty and the scallop was cooked perfectly. I was excited my friend ordered the lamb chop as I had never tried it before.

Our waitress was exceptionally nice, helpful, knowledgeable and honest. This is a place to impress.

So let this be my ode to one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco....\n\nBoulevard, I LOVE YOU.\n\n2012 is the pinnacle year of your long-standing success.  Knowing you are a James Beard Award Winner for outstanding restaurant after an unprecedented eight consecutive nominations makes me weak at my knees.  Abalone Benedict with a poached Jidori egg?  Just reading it on the menu made my heart skip a beat.  Eating it was a different story... the lush yellow-orange yolk spilling over a mouthful of abalone and prosciutto nearly sent me into cardiac arrest.  You pulling out all the stops for me just makes me blush and fall for you even more.  I can't go on right now... if I recount the time I took one bite of pork belly and mumbled \"porkfatjizz\" at the table, I would need a defibrillator very close by.\n\nAlthough our love has been consummated on more than few occasions, for obvious reasons I cannot stay faithful to you.  But Sandy, you ask, why not pinch pennies and eat ramen every meal and solely patronize Boulevard?  I don't want to water down our romance.  But know you are my favorite and that I think of you always.\n\nOne of my favorite things about you is your utter lack of mediocrity.  Every time I dine with you feels like I've died and gone to a heaven where even among the glittery constellations of Michelin star-studded restaurants in SF, you shine the brightest and the truest.  \n\nFriends of mine say I'm happiest when I'm eating.  This is true.  Boulevard, you bring me happiness in the form of sheer gastronomical delight.  Please don't ever leave me.", "author": "Sandy T."}

The Kabocha Squash was cooked perfectly, tender with it still packed with flavor. The pork was cooked amazingly and the braised bacon marmalade topped it perfectly. \n\nI ordered dessert - if I thought choosing from the menu was hard, I was torn between the red velvet cake and Baked Alaska. I had to go with the Baked Alaska because it made me think of Alton Brown. Of course it wasn't the same exact type of Baked Alaska he makes, but it was as amazing as I imagined.

Boulevard has been a SF classic for as long as I can remember and it NEVER EVER disappoints.

I love that their wine list is not as pretentious as other nice restaurants in SF (meaning you can find plenty of options under $75, a rare treat at a fancy restaurant). The service is always top notch - they're on top of everything and properly attentive without bothering you or being in your face. We all had fish, but the meat is equally good from past experience. Highly recommend the carpaccio to start and the Irish Coffee bon bons for dessert. SO GOOD! If you can, ask for a table by the window so you can look out on the Embarcadero and see the new Bay Bridge lights.\n\nChoose Boulevard for your next special occasion.

Just a note, but I would suggest getting a table where the elevated floors are. It's more quiet and romantic compared to the tables closer to the kitchen and the bar. \n\nWe started the night with a bottle of Gloria Ferrer. All through the night our glasses were never empty because the waitstaff was so attentive. The bread that they served was very plain and too hard for my taste. The butter also had salt on it, which I'm not a big fan of. \n\nFor our appetizers, we had the Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Sonoma foie gras. The tuna tartare was just ok, nothing special. In my opinion, there was too much vinegar. I would've wanted some sesame oil instead of all that vingear. The foie gras was so delicious! One of the best I've had!\n\nFor entrees, we had the lamb chop and the lobster with scallops. The lamb chop was delicious and even a non-lamb lover like me enjoyed it! The maine lobster and scallops came with a Limoncello risotto that complemented the dish very well! Everything was cooked perfectly!\n\nWe decided to skip on dessert because next door is Chaya and they have my favorite dessert of all time - chocolate croissant bread pudding. Service was excellent and the waitstaff was really helpful and attentive to our needs. Everyone from our waitress to the busyboys were extremely courteous. \n\nOverall, excellent service, good food, and a romantic ambience.

Yah... I didn't get that here. I'd been looking forward to checking this place out for awhile and finally made it here and was greatly disappointed. \n\nThis place reminds me of One Market. It's one of those restaurants down in the Financial District catering to the business men and women who are in hotels nearby. It's supposed to be great, but only ok. \n\nStarters: \nAHI TUNA ITO-ZUKURI\n*Hand Line Caught,\"Ribbon-Cut\" Ahi Tuna Yuzu-Coriander Braised Hodo Soy Tofu Natural Enoki Mushrooms, Scallions & Black Sesame Wild Rice \"Furikake\", Sudachi Lime Yuzu Aioli \n- My bf had this dish, but I tried it and it was pretty good. The enoki mushrooms were really scrumptious. The ahi itself was a little bland. I expected a little more flavor from it. \n\nPAN SEARED SEA SCALLOPS\n* Artichoke Hearts, Fresh Shelling Beans & Sea Spinach Preserved Lemon, Castelvetrano Olive & Amaranth Gremolata\n- My starter, however, kicked my bf's starters bootie. This was really delicious. The artichoke hearts were tasty and gave a nice saltiness eaten with the scallops. The olives weren't overpowering at all, which I expected. Instead they gave a nice freshness to the dish. \n\nMains: \nANGUS FILET MIGNON\n* Wood Oven Roasted Potatoes Cacio E Pepe: Red Thumb Fingerlings with Pecorino, Parmesan & Crushed Black Pepper Roasted King Trumpet Mushrooms, Shaved Scarlett Turnips & Roasted Radishes with Thyme Sauteed Bloomsdale Spinach, Penja Peppercorn Beef Jus \n- My bf had this one. I tasted the filet and it melted like butter in my mouth. It was cooked to perfection. They had a little play of a fried egg on top with the turnips and potatoes. It was a nice surprise for him. \n\nMAINE LOBSTER & TAYLOR MUSSEL BEIGNETS HALF 1.5# BUTTER POACHED LOBSTER\n* Shellfish Mushrooms: Lobster, Abalone, Clamshell & Oyster Risotto Al Nero & Lobster Stuffed Ale Battered Mussels, Tarragon Meyer Lemon Aioli\n- The mussels on this dish were delicious! It wasn't expecting to like it all that much, but it was my favorite part of the dish. The risotto was a little undercooked and over salted, so I was not pleased. The abalone had a weird flavor to it and normally I'm a big fan. \n\nDessert: \nCHOCOLATE POT DE CREME\n* Flourless Chocolate Cake, Caramel Malt Syrup, Guinness Meringue, Milk Chocolate Lace, Malted Ice Cream  \n- My bf had this and I was completely jealous. I wanted to steal this from him. The malted ice cream was really interesting and gave a different texture to the ice cream. The cake was delicious. I'm a huge fan of dessert and I only got a bite of this, I'd go back just for this. \n\nSTICKY TOFFEE SUNDAE\n* Medjool Date Cake, English Toffee, Toasted Almond Ice Cream, Hot Fudge\n Buttered Pecans \n- Can't complain about my dessert though, it was really tasty and literally a sticky dessert. It was a little sweet after awhile though, so I couldn't finish it. \n\nSERVICE\nThis is where I'm completely peeved. The service should be more or less on point, but it wasn't. We waited over 25 minutes just for our starters. Our waiter barely came by our table. Having empty drinks on the table is not acceptable if we're paying for food and service. No apology, just glazed over it like it was normal. We were right in front of the main service pass. You could tell the kitchen was backed up, so I'm sure that the starter's pass was just as backed up, but that doesn't mean you can't come by the table to check on your guests. \n\nThe food was good, the service was not. It's one of those places where I'll cross it off my list and it'd be lucky for me to ever return. Although, that chocolate pot de creme is a good temptation to lure me back, that memory of the service slaps me back to reality.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

Bumping it from 3 to 4 stars. \n\n\n***\n\nWe went here last night for anniversary dinner. The plusses: excellent, charming waiter who mastered the balance of being attentive without bugging us. My filet mignon was extremely tender and seasoned to perfection. The beets and winter citrus salad was also really flavorful and beautifully presented. Our desserts were delicious (banana caramel ice cream and they brought a mini chocolate mousse complimentary for our anniversary). They sat us at a super cute table where we sat side by side and could watch the chefs. \n\nThe minuses: it was a Tuesday night, so there was a ton of stuffy business people and thus, the atmosphere was a bit stuffy and pretentious. I wasn't expecting that part; I'm not that familiar with the Fi-Di but in hindsight it seems apt that at 6 on a Tuesday night it would be full of biz peeps. The portions were smaller than I'd expect for the prices. Dinner was $180 with a tip, and we didn't drink. Ouch. \n\nI'm really glad we went; it's been on our bucket list for a long time. It was a memorable but I don't know that we'll blow that kind of cash again on dinner there. Maybe the ambiance is way different on a weekend? I dunno. The space is stunning, but the atmosphere and pretentiousness of the crowd turned me off. I just don't know that we'll go back, despite having a great meal.", "author": "H H."}

I've enjoyed numerous lunches and and dinners here over the years, and I have never been disappointed.  Not even slightly disappointed.\n\nBoulevard has an incredible array of appetizers, entrees, and desserts, and make sure to go very hungry to do the best justice to the diversity on the menu.  Amongst my favorites are their various risottos and sole & halibut dishes. They also have a great skirt steak, soft-shell crab, and much more.  There is some menu rotation, but generally speaking the menu is similar each time I visit- perhaps 60% similar.  My wife claims they have the best hamburger that she has ever had... Other tips are to try their signature cocktails, or if not consuming alcohol, they have wonderful 'fresh daily lemonades', featuring various complimentary fruit flavor blends.  Save room for dessert- they have a wonderful variety of creative dishes- but if you are too hungry, simply go for their ice-cream bon-bons- they can be ordered by the piece and are a manageably sized and delicious 'two-biter'.\n\nOf course the Bridge & Embarcadero view is legendary, but if you have a group of 8 or 10- they may be able to place you in their super secret wine cellar room - I didn't know about this room (after scores of visits...) until we were placed in their with a group of 7 sometime last summer.  Now I try to request it if we have an adequately sized dinner party.\n\nBoulevard has remained a consistent winner with exceptional service and food over the years.

The waiters made us feel at home and joked around with us. \n\nAmbiance made me feel as if I were in Paris (check out the brick ceiling!). This place would make a perfect place for an anniversary dinner, as more than half the restaurant is dedicated to 2-person tables. Boulevard is also in a romantic location, right by the pier and bow & arch (where you left your heart in San Francisco), with a lovely view of the Bay bridge.\n\nFor appetizer I ordered the Ahi Tuna tartare, not the best choice. It was okay, but nothing special. My boyfriend ordered the foie gras, probably the best choice! It was a huge portion (good thing it was, since it was $27!) and could easily and comfortably be split between two people. \n\nMain entrees were delicious! I ordered the roasted duck, which was really yummy. Very tender and went well with the wild rice. Weird to say this, but one of the things I remember most from this dish is the 3 little pearl onions that went with it. They were cooked very soft and juicy from the oil...my mouth waters just thinking of it! My boyfriend ordered the lamb, which he really loved. I tried some and it tasted like beef, not gamey at all.

I'd had a relaxing time there before.\n\nThe four of us made a reservation for 9:30 p.m., and showed up on time.  Our table wasn't ready, and I got the tried-and-true airline-style runaround when I tried to find out how long it would be.  \"Oh, they're just clearing it.\"  Right.  Ten minutes later, we were seated.  \n\nOur waiter came by and I asked for the wine steward, because by that time we'd pretty much decided on our courses.  I wanted to ask about some domestic sauvignon blancs vs. a nice sancerre to suit the food choices that two of us had made.  Time passed.  More time passed.  I flagged the waiter as he was passing by, and was assured the wine steward was \"just coming.\"  I was embarassed that I'd delayed my companions' dinner, and ordered a 2009 Rochioli sauvignon blanc to go with two of our choices.\n\nThe wine came, and it was a 2010.  The wine steward finally materialized upon my pointing out this fact.  He was dour, expressionless, didn't make eye contact, and didn't apologize for the error.  He checked (more time) and determined that indeed, there was no more 2009.  In the interest of time, I stuck with the 2010.  (Easy money-saver tip: don't shell out for the two year old Rochioli sauv blanc at Boulevard.)\n\nOur food was very nice.  That night, there was a lovely abalone first course.  I had quail, with the legs _confites_ and the breast poached in butter.  Very good.\n\nBut the overall experience was tainted, and I felt it necessary to apologize to my hosts.

It was always a magical place for me, with fantastic food. \n\nThis week I went back for a special meal. And boy, was I surprised. \n\nFirst, the service. Rushed. Appetizers arrived less than a minute after ordering and the busboy hovered over our table waiting to snatch the plate. Mains arrived two minutes after the appetizers were done.  Total elapsed time: 14 minute since ordering. Drinks arrived with the mains (and the bread). Service was earnest...but bad. I realize that this was a holiday weekend, but there is no excuse for this. Service was always a strong point at Boulevard. No longer.\n\nNext, the food. While the appetizers were great, my lamb was not. Was that GRIT in my spinach? Why yes, it was! They didn't take the time to wash the spinach properly. I passed the first bite of my lamb T-bone to my wife. Her comment. \"Wow. That's a lot of gristle!\". The lamb was tough and gristly and hideously oversalted. The more I ate, the worse it got.  (My wife's filet was actually a quite nice piece of meat, although badly cooked). \n\nI complained to the manager. She looked bored, like she had heard it all before.\n\nWe went to Ducca for dessert.\n\nIn summary, Boulevard is no longer what it was. Five years ago, this was a great restaurant - perhaps one of the best in the country. Now it feels like they are just phoning it in.\n\n What rating would you give the meal if it wasn't for the magical \"Boulevard\" name on the front? I would probably give it two stars, except for the fact that they are charging $40 an entree. For that price, there are a lot of absolutely magical places to eat in San Francisco. Hence, one star for merely OK food and just plain bad service at top prices.", "author": "Joshua M."}

We walk through the revolving doors and the d\u00e9cor is very unique and pleasant. Definitely a nice cozy feel to it even though it does seat quite a few people. The ambiance is formal but not over the top stuffy which I appreciated and in the back the kitchen was open showing the Chef's working away which is something I always enjoy watching.  Just as a note, this place does get fairly loud and this was on a Wednesday night so I can only imagine how loud it would get on a weekend night.\n\nWe were promptly seated at the restaurant and immediately a waiter comes over and offers us menu with a smile. I peruse the vino list and ask the server for recommendations and he was able to direct me to the perfect vino. We then look through the dinner menu and I decide to try the Tuna and the California Lamb T Bone. The tuna comes out and the presentation is very nice. The mushrooms on the dish were tasty but I was a bit disappointed with the tuna itself because it did seem a bit bland and not as fresh as I was hoping for. Shaking off the confusion I get pumped for the Lamb T bone. Now just so everyone knows, I am actually not a huge lamb person because it could taste \"gamey.\" The lamb comes out and again the presentation is solid and it comes with delicious potatoes. I take my first bite and the potatoes are delicious and the lamb to my surprise is not \"gamey\" at all. Solid but not anything that blows me away. I was a bit disappointed and maybe because I had high expectations so that is the fault.\n\nOverall I think Boulevard is a solid restaurant but maybe a bit over hyped.

I'd never been to Boulevard, but I'd heard it's quite the fancy restaurant and since we were celebrating my birthday, I used it as an excuse to get dressed up!  Boulevard is not the kind of restaurant where you feel out of place if you're dressed up.\n\nWe were seated at a little booth by a window where we sat next to each other on a cushy bench seat.  It was very cozy and romantic.  Perfect table for us.\n\nOur server was extremely helpful and I like how they have coat hooks by all the tables to hang up your jackets.

It was sooo good!  The squab was really tender and flavorful and the gnocchi was yum.  I love potatoes, so I love gnocchis.  I normally don't eat squab because I used to have pet parakeets and don't like the thought of eating little birds.  We also shared the Ahi Tuna Tartare with Grilled Black Sesame Cracker, Wasabi Tobiko, Preserved Citrus & Black Radish Vinaigrette, Pickled Shiitake Mushrooms, and Shishito Pepper Oil.

Don't worry, you don't need to dirty your hands on this one.  The lobster is peeled and everything is really neat and tidy.  I liked the lemony flavor of this dish.

Literally.  \n\nA ordered the Wood Oven Roasted Lamb Prime Rib Chops with Sauteed Red & Green Spinach, Potato Fritters with Bearnaise Sauce, Red Wine & Tarragon Lamb Jus, and White Mint Sauce.  I tried a little bit of the lamb and it was super yum!  The spinach though, wow, sooo flavorful!\n\nFor dessert, I ordered the Chocolate Macaron with Roasted White Chocolate with Chocolate Mirror Glaze & Chocolate Curls, Truffles, Pressed Pear & Pistachio Tuile, and Pistachio Ice Cream.  They don't skimp on this one.  It's a huge dessert.  It was good and it was chocolatey.  They even put a candle in it and a separate piece of chocolate that said Happy Birthday on it.  So cool!  A ordered the Clementine Cake with Frozen Blood Orange Souffle, Huckleberries, Mosaic of Winter Citrus, and Meyer Lemon Meringue.  His was super light and very citrusy.  I liked it.\n\nAwesome restaurant, great service, delicioso food.  I'd go again if I could afford it.  Two yums up!", "author": "Kris L."}

We had four people so each one of us ordered one appetizer and one main course so all of us get to try out all of them. This is what we ordered for appetizer:\n\n1. SONOMA FOIE GRAS - very nicely cooked! This is one of the best foie gras that I've ever had. It melted in my mouth....la la la la la~~~~\n2. MONTEREY RED ABALONE - the abalone was very tender, and the fried green tomatoes were awesome (now i realized it's green tomato....we thought it was some kind of melon at first haha~)!!\n3. CRISPY MARYLAND SOFT SHELL CRAB - first impression was \"is this a thai dish?\" the shell soft shell crab was on the hard side....but the chili noodle was pretty good~\n4. FRESH HERB ROASTED PORCINI & RICOTTA STUFFED SQUASH BLOSSOM - i like this dish, but i think it's a bit too pricy....the fried ricotta cheese ball was a surprise~\n\nAs for the main, I ordered the WOOD OVEN ROASTED CALIFORNIA LAMB PRIME T-BONE - i love lamb so everywhere i go i usually ordered lamb. The meat was sooooo tender and juicy even thou i had it cooked medium rare~ the only complain was foraged greens....they took me a while to chew them down...\n\nmy friends had ordered the duck breast, pork prime rib chop and filet mignon. I had a piece of each meat and they were all tender and juicy inside and crispily roasted outside. Overall they were all pretty good.\n\nWe didn't get to ordered desserts but the TIRAMISU ICE CREAM CAKE\ndid catch my eye.....if i ever go back again i think i will get that for sure!\n\nAfter tax and tips the bill came out to be around $300. Service was okay, food is great~ Portion is decent in a girl's point of view...I don't know about the guy's~ Overall it's a nice experience!", "author": "Louisa L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-08-06", "description": "The James beard award put Boulevard back on the map this year - it's definitely a San Francisco classic, with dark wood decor, revolving doors, classic and strong cocktails like the Moscow Mule and the Cucumber Gimlet, while adapting its menu a little more for local ingredients.  \n\nThe space is actually long and narrow, and it's pretty lively inside, so it's definitely not one of those stuffy fancy places.  It's not cramped, per se, but there's not a lot of room to maneuver.  Service is prompt but not hasty, and drinks are refilled quickly.\n\nFor drinks, don't be fooled by the fruity sounding peach cocktail because it's pretty strong and not too sweet.\n\nThey didn't have a tasting menu, but my friend and I kind of created our own... we started with the beet salad, with roasted red beets, lemon cucumber, champagne grapes, and a good amount of goat cheese - you can't really go wrong with that combination.\n\nNext, we had the seared scallops, which were complemented nicely by the artichoke, and it came with three perfectly seared pieces.  The lobster dish was buttery and tender, with smokiness and richness from bacon and melted leeks, but I wasn't as big a fan of the risotto al nero, which was more like purple rice (I was expecting more like a squid ink risotto).\n\nFor the main we had the bone in Kurobuta pork chop, which was tender and cooked just right.  I'm a big fan of fruit with my pork chop, so I would have liked more cherries with it, but it had enough flavor in itself to stand alone.  The greens underneath were drenched in pork jus and lardo, making it a very enjoyable vegetable accompaniment. \n\nFor dessert, we had the chocolate marquis, which wasn't too sweet but was definitely rich and satisfying.  I like the crunch of the hazelnut wafer and the slight kick from the coffee flavor.\n\nI appreciate that a classic restaurant can stick to its roots while maintaining a very well rounded experience.  I'm glad that after multiple nominations, they finally got the Outstanding Restaurant recognition.", "author": "Marilyn H."}

Yeehaw!  No more tuition!!!   I'm glad I don't own or operate a restaurant, because even some of the best places had just brutal reviews!  Boulevard was no exception.  We found it to be completely worth the effort of the quest.  We all had different salads and entrees, and when coerced shared bites.  I frankly don't like to share so giving up even small nibbles of my King Crab salad and entree of wild caught King Salmon was difficult.  Our daughter didn't/wouldn't share because she enjoyed her fried squash blossoms over a sweet corn risotto too much to let any of it go.  I'm not a beef eater but our daughter's boyfriend is, and he said the big chunk of steak thing he had was delicious as well.  Rich had a halibut served over a bed of tobouli - his only complaint, in fact the only complaint between all of us that evening where the entrees were concerned was that the tobouli was cold and the fish was hot.  He knew that it would be served that way however, when he ordered it because our server, who I loved, had warned him.  The desserts were amazing.  (One, that was supposed to be butterscotch had a little too much of a delicious chocolate swirled through the dessert and it overpowered the butterscotch). Our cab driver told us on the way there in fact,  that we had to have dessert.  She and her friends head there at the end of their shifts and splurge before heading home for the night - again, we each had different desserts and this time we all agreed to take a bite and pass the plate to the right so we could try all of them.  This is when it gets tricky, one man's bite is another one's scarf! as in don't eat all my chocolate thing or I'll kill you.  The graduate I think ended up with the best dessert, not the one she originally ordered.  It was a tart cherry crumble and it was delicious!  As it was her night, we decided it only fair to let her have the last say.  The portions overall were perfect.\n\nBoulevard has a full bar, and a really nice wine list.  I loved the ambiance - many reviews said it was fancy, I found it more casual fancy at most.  Lots of jeans and hip looks, but not many groups looking intimidatingly \"fancy\".  I highly recommend it for the delicious food and the overall experience.  Take a walk out on to the pier after dinner, great view of the city, and don't forget a slicker like I did, oh well. . .", "author": "Myrna S."}

Nancy Oakes is one of the local pioneers in the San Francisco dining scene, starting with L'Avenue on Geary, Boulevard, and the newly opened Prospect. \nHere's what we ate: \nAppetizers (shared) \n1) Big Island Abalone - Two tender pieces in a creamy bean sauce. The sauce made for a great bread soaker. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=OWOaiduW8Bwg8PkNWlxGCw) \n2) Tuna Poke and Sashimi - Served with rice puffs and fried seaweed, the sashimi was mouth melting tender while the poke was creamy and topped with Wasabi tobiko. Refreshing starter. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=55vQ8swirwFxxNW1_gOoXA) \n3) Fried Soft Shell Crab - Cut into two halves, the crab was crispy good. Accompanied by an Asian flavored slaw and pickled radish strips. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=kaE2AhAANwV6cxWNrADeCw) \n4) Dayboat Scallops - Three medium large scallops seared well and topped with a spicy red sauce. Potato cubes mixed well with the sauce. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=jGVeUqYzXCwQjYm1x1dvZQ) \nEntree \n5) Grilled Pork Prime Rib Chop - One of their classic dishes, the meat was a bit more well done than I like, but still tasty. The garnishes provided a carousel of flavors with spinach with garlic, baby carrots on a small mound of mashed yam, four interestingly flavored croutons (crunchy yet soft centered), and fresh Bing cherries. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=cnMHLvH4lzVMXvwurUKyug) \nDessert (shared) \n6) Chocolate Cherry S'mores - Chocolate Devil's Cake topped with melted marshmallow sauce with a scoop of Cherry Ice Cream. A shortbread cookie came with this dish. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=h50IGBOqLhMIspOhvTnyWg) \n\nMy friends were kind to give me bites of their entrees, roasted lamb (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=1AIwgMyisOgfQdbYPTEsWg_ and roasted white sea bass (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Tttm1r5Dw1sRMCfc3EQWPw?select=QmxkSEF7xpyHy-1awihRLQ). \nThe restaurant hasn't changed much over the years. On a holiday weekend Friday night, it was busy, but not packed, with mostly out-of-towners and older local couples. Wait... think I'm one of those older customers there. Our waiter, also local, was surprised that we were locals and joked with us about other fine dining restaurants in the city.  Besides the comforting atmosphere, I always remember their blue glassware (water glasses),a rarity in restaurants these days (The Restaurant - Ritz). The food is comforting and uses local, seasonal ingredients. My friends hosted the dinner which came to just around $85.00 per person (no wine or alcohol). Definitely not an everyday dining spot, this restaurant is a nice destination for those special occasions.  Nice to see things haven't changed much over the years.

She is the queen hell goddess of parking karma, so we found a spot on the street right in front of the door.  I can't help the rest of you with that aspect, sorry.\n\nWe're not big alcohol drinkers so we always appreciate when a restaurant has specialty non-alcoholic drinks.  I had the Elderflower Syrup drink and my wife had the Arnold Palmer.  Our charmingly dorky waiter said he liked my choice better and he was right.  The elderflower was so flavorful I ordered a second one.  The Arnold Palmer was okay, but I make a better one at home with fresh-squeezed lemon and Earl Grey tea.\n\nAppetizers: Scallops, mouthwatering, though I thought only three scallops for two people was a bit chintzy.  Fig Prosciutto and Carmelized Pecan salad also first class.  Entrees: we both had lamb T-bone cooked to perfection.  It came with a juicy spinach sautee and fingerling potatoes.  The potatoes were a bit dry, though they tasted good.  I was too busy \"mmmmmmm\"ing over the lamb to notice.  Dessert: she had one of the home-made ice creams and I had a couple of chocolate coated peanutbutter ice cream bonbons.  Bonbons tasted heavenly but were partially melted inside, should have been solid ice cream.\n\nI notice I had three reservations about food items, but I'll still give Boulevard a five star rating for the beauty of the interior, the smartness of the service and the general excellence of the food.

I understand--I sometimes feel cynicism hood my eyes and tastebuds the moment I sit down in the most hyped, trendy San Francisco establishments. Maybe it's the same instinct that has us call size 4 actresses \"fat\" and Miss America runners-up \"hideous.\" \n\nAfter reading a chain of yelp reviews bashing Boulevard, I wasn't sure what to expect. In the end, I'm siding with Michelin. Boulevard earned that star. Our meals were some of the best we have had.  The Heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella starter may have been the most pedestrian listing on the menu, but by no means was it dull. The tomatoes looked and tasted like they had just fallen off the vine, the mozzarella tasted more like burratta, and the sprinkling of toasted spring onions were like teeny-tiny onion rings, taking the dish out of the realm of caprese salad. My quail was perfectly cooked and I can't praise the farro enough. The filet mignon was just as good. \n\nThe dessert was a highlight (but then, that's always my favorite part of a meal). We split a deconstructed s'mores: a buttery homemade cookie-like graham cracker, a square of devil's food cake with a thick layer of ganache, topped with a layer of bruleed homemade marshmallow, a scoop of homemade cherry ice cream, and a sprinkling of cherries. I could have eaten ten of them. Oh, and you might have sensed the theme--yes, every dessert, including ice cream, is homemade. \n\nThe service is top-notch. I've read other reviews that complained that service was too attentive. Really? Personally, I like a full water glass. And I won't chide anyone for being too good at a job. That's like when a peer tutor came into my class and told my students that they were \"over-prepared.\" \n\nYes, the prices are high.

It all combines with delicious ingredients and incredible desserts.\n\nThe lunch menu seemed to have few items but everything we had was the best we've ever tasted. They found a way to elevate a cesar salad, to make a believer of scallops out of someone who can only have them bacon wrapped and sold my mom on the bass.

We got one of the best tables in the house, right in front of the window in the corner. Fantastic view overlooking the Bay Bridge.\n\nI ordered the Sonoma foie gras (by far my favorite dish) and the lamb T-bone.  My sister and her boyfriend ordered the potato gnocchi with rabbit porcini bolognese and the pork prime rib chop.  For dessert, we ordered the strawberry tart and hummingbird cake.  All of the food tasted fresh and amazing, the portions were actually quite filling (I had three beautiful, juicy cuts of the lamb T-bone), and I left feeling fully satisfied.\n\nThe service and quality of food are top notch- and expected, for what you are paying.  Our bill plus the corkage fee plus the freaking 10% SF sales tax plus the freaking 10% healthy kids whatever tax came out to be $100 per person...with about 20% of the bill going to taxes.  I think the dining experience is definitely worth it, just a little bitter about all of the tax-piling.\n\nEverything on the menu tastes amazing, so you can't really go wrong.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-22", "description": "Food and service was amazing. The food was beautifully plated and the quality was superb. The service was wonderful. I was most pleased when our waiter came over and asked \"do you have any questions?\" I asked him if he could tell me what was on the dish. He was so nice and explained all the components of the dish and thereafter, made the detailed effort to come back and explain everything else on the other dishes. I really appreciated his thoroughness and patience in explaining all the dishes. When you are not looking at the menu, it is hard to remember what you ordered and it made the experience a lot better when the waiter explained what you were about to eat. All the little details from the food and service, really gave this place a special sparkle. Boulevard is very well deserving of the James Beard 2012 award (http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/SF-Boulevard-restaurant-wins-James-Beard-award-3541335.php).\n\nFor our dinner for two in June (before Foie Gras was banned in SF), we ordered: \n\n* Monterey Red Abalone $22 (5 of 5) Delta Asparagus, Crisp Abalone Mushrooms, Green Goddess, Borage & Tarragon. The dish only serves two slices of abalone, but it is of fabulous texture - soft and delicate. And well paired with its vegetarian equivalent abalone mushrooms.  This is a fun dish; I just wish I got some more pieces of abalone. But at last, I had to save room for my other dishes.\n\n* Hudson Valley Foie Gras $29 (5 of 5) Huckleberry \"Shrub\" & Pickled Rhubarb, Caramel Rice & Lake County Walnuts, Wild Rice Toast. The foie gras was delicious and nicely paired with the huckleberry. I didn't favor the wild rice toast too much, because it tasted like rice cake, but it was made in-house and I thought it was a clever new take on the bread paired with foie gras. \n\n* Foie Gras Custard $19 (5 of 5) Fresh Porcini Mushrooms & Foie Gras \"Custard\", Grilled Hearts of Palm, Smoked Mushrooom Coulis, Maderia Jus. This dish was refreshing and an explosion of taste. Imagine eating Yoplait Custard but with the flavor of foie gras. It was creamy and all foie gras. Absolutely delightful to taste. The side components were also fresh and paired very nicely with the Foie Gras. I never had grilled hearts of palm and I rather liked it. It was mellow tasting and texture a little like fresh bamboo. It was tasty and paired very well with the strong flavors of the foie gras custard.\n\n* Crispy Maryland Soft Shell Crab $17.50 (4.5 of 5) Golden Carolina Rice Grits with celery and Jalapeno Pickled kale, Sea Island Peas & Sorghum. This dish was wonderful, but just not as amazing as the foie gras or abalone dishes. Because this dish was fried, it seemed a little heavier than the other dishes. Don't get me wrong, this is still absolutely fabulous dish, but the other three were just more fabulous. Probably because this dish was fried and the others were not, that's why this dish was heavier in taste.\n\n* Berkshire (Kurobuta) Pork Prime Rib Chop Wood Oven Roasted $37 (5.5 of 5) Roasted Chanterelle Mushrooms & Anson Mills Polenta with Herb Butter & Parmesan, Broccoli di Ciccio with Our Pancetta, Garlic & Chili Flake, Blueberry, Pickled Shallot & Sage Relish, Roasted Pork Jus & Aged Balsamic. Oh my goodness. Probably one of the best pork chops ever. It was so juicy and tender, I couldn't even believe it was pork chop when I ate it. Delicious! \n\n* Angus Filet Mignon Wood Oven Roasted $42 (5.5 of 5) Fondant French Fingerling Potatoes & Smoked Red Onion Marmalade, Broccoli di Ciccio, Onion Rings & Sherry Caramelizd Cipollini, Sauce Vert, Green Peppercorn Beef Jus, V.S.O.P. Butter with Foie Gras. Oh my goodness twice. Boulevard's filet mignon is probably one of the best ever. The quality of meat is top notch. The way they cooked it was perfect. It was so soft; you didn't even need a steak knife. The cut was so thick (at least 2.5 inches high), but when you cut it in half, it was perfectly cook to medium rare. No blood drippings and perfect brown rim around the perimeter of the meat. It was amazing. I definitely recommend this dish. However, I didn't feel like this dish needed the onion rings. It was fine without it. And I didn't really taste the foie gras butter on the beef. Maybe it merged into the filet. None the less, the filet mignon could hold on its own just by itself.   \n\n* Dessert \"Black Forest\" Ice Box Cake $11 (4 of 5) Layers of Devil's Food Cake, Chocolate Mousse, Cherry Glee, Espresso Caramel, Cherry Chocolate Chip Ice Cream. This was a beautifully layered devil's cake with alternating layers of cake and mousse. Delicious, but if you are full, you can pass on the dessert.   \n\n* Dessert milk chocolate peanut butter bon bon $3.50 each (4 of 5) Good, but I think I can pass on the bon bon next time. \n\nBoulevard was fabulous in food and service. It is definitely worth going for special occasions. Don't forget to use open table to make reservations.", "author": "Janice T."}

The figs on the dish were delicious.\n\nThe only disappointing part of the meal was the desserts.

For those prices, you would expect a wonderful experience.\nTo make a long story short, the service was brusque and curt, the food was overseasoned and sweet, and drinks were overpriced.\nThe server talked really fast. Instead of telling us details to try to help, he just listened for a half-second and would interrupt and say, you should go with ---. I definitely got the feeling he was trying to move us quickly so he could get a second sitting e.g. second tip for the night. Also he sold me on a wine which was nothing like what I had asked for, didn't let me taste it first, then never said anything despite the glass sitting there completely unconsumed (at most really nice restaurants, the server would have offered a different wine or comp'd the obviously disliked wine). Generally he didn't seem happy to have us there; he seemed to be going through the motions as efficiently as possible. It felt like a business transaction.\nI was disappointed in the abalone. Smothered in rich sweet sauce so that you could barely taste the abalone. Likewise the pork chop entreee was smothered in sweet cherry sauce. The best things all night were probably the bread because the butter came with sprinkled sea salt which was tasty and the ahi tuna was which very fresh. The filet mignon was pretty good although not outstanding. Generally speaking, the food was all decent but not memorable or inventive or unusual in any way.\nThe drinks were all slightly upcharged such that the alcohol bill came in pretty hefty.\nI have to say, this place isn't worth the prices.

Got seated in the back 1/3 of th place which is my favorite for nice conversation among diners. The central area is abuzz with the cook staff and open kitchen moving swiftly and the front part is with the bar. Each area has its own unique style and can suite to taste. \n\nOur server was very professional (Jay) and was very smooth throughout the entire meal.

Great busboy service for refills and clearing of the plates. \n\nThe food is just the best tasting. Dinner menu has about 10 entries in the appetizer/salad section, and there were 7 main courses. Our foursome had the heirloom tomatoes, the beet salad and the sliced beef with lobster plate.  All were absolutely wonderful.

The tuna was done in strips and it was stupid good, like to the point where we were even gobbling the lettuce garnish.  For a main course I had the lamb, which comes off the bone but praise PETA, that had to have been one of the best pieces of meat I've had in my life.

As for the wine, the bottles are extremely extremely overpriced.  Here is a tip:  bring your own bottle (its cool) and pay the $30 corkage fee.  That way you can go out and buy a nice bottle for $45 that the restaurant would charge you $135 for.  Add the corkage fee and it is still cheaper to BYOB!\n\nService:  Service was stellar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-08-26", "description": "We ate here several months ago for lunch. Despite being well-dressed and well-mannered we were treated snobbishly at the host stand, as in, more snobbishly than I can recall being treated anywhere, but we brush off that kind of thing and I wasn't particularly worried about it at the time. We had our small son with us, so I thought maybe they just don't like kids, but was not worried because he's very well-behaved.\n\nWe waited much longer than I would have expected for our server. Again, not great but no big deal. Then we ordered and explained our son has serious food allergies. We asked whether a particular item, which seemed like a pretty good fit, would be safe for him to eat. The server seemed completely unwilling to help us determine whether it would be okay for him. After several exchanges, all perfectly cordial on our end, she said, \"Well I COULD go and ask, but...\" as though her having to do so was clearly unreasonable. (Even at low-end places, servers often go ask so they can be sure what they're talking about.) \n\nI was surprised that she didn't know the ingredients better, which might have allowed her to make suggestions as often happens in this situation; didn't care when it was a serious matter; and didn't even want to try to find out. I actually felt kind of intimidated given that this is a safety issue. I said nicely, \"Could you?\" And she seemed taken aback that I was actually asking. I was deeply surprised that she didn't seem remotely invested in us and our son having a decent, non-emergency room experience, which should have been easily achievable. (Of course we would tip extra for her trouble.) Finally she did go ask -- I think it required two trips since her first trip did not actually resolve the issue -- and we figured out something for him to eat. She then left us alone for a very long time. If she was angry that we'd taken extra time, well, it would have taken far less time if she'd been helpful from the outset instead of basically making us force her. I was seriously unsettled by her indifference and not exactly set up to enjoy a nice meal. \n\nWhatever I ordered was unmemorable which is a shame given the price. My husband had an okay entree and a delicious soup -- definitely, memorably good -- that was not warm enough by a wide margin. He pointed it out to the server in his extremely nice, low-key way. She said it had just cooled in the wide, shallow bowl. He again said very nicely that it just didn't seem hot enough to eat. It truly didn't, and my husband won't complain about things that seem marginal. She dithered again. Finally she took the soup away, reluctantly. When she came back she explained that the pepper was still in there, but no longer on top, since the soup had been taken out of the bowl, reheated and put back in. Since when is the health department okay with that? If the soup is too cold, it may be growing bacteria and needs to be completely replaced and put in a new, clean bowl. I couldn't believe that she was actually telling us they'd handled it that way, let alone the fact that they'd ACTUALLY HANDLED IT THAT WAY. Ugh. \n\nWe didn't say anything further but finished up as soon as we could. We will certainly not be going back. My husband had had this restaurant on his list for a long time and it was a disappointment that it turned out to be the least enjoyable meal of our weekend in the city.\n\nThe check took a very long time and I took my son outside for a little walk, mostly because I couldn't wait to leave. Going out and coming back in I smiled nicely at the hostesses and they stared at us like bugs. I usually think people are just hypersensitive on Yelp when they say the hostesses or whomever were snotty but this was truly extreme, complete with looking us up and down appraisingly, which had also happened when we first arrived. It didn't seem they recognized that we were customers even though they'd been the ones to seat us in the first place.\n\nTwo stars for potential: the flavor, if not the temperature and service of, the soup, and the truly awesome nonalcoholic drinks -- best I've ever had.", "author": "Megan M."}

But, it was hard not to like Boulevard from the start.\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the great mix of patrons.....tourists in jeans and shorts, old money San Fran, young couples, new money San Fran.....all cohabitating nicely in this fairly fancy setting. Didn't see any kids but mine (which always worries me a bit) but they were well-behaved and blended in too.\n\nServers were great. Pace was not too slow or fast. Wife got a Ketel Cosmo and I got a drink off the menu that had about 40 ingredients in it (the only ingredients I remember were cognac and orgeat syrup). Cosmo was reported to be excellent and mine was good but a bit tart overall. Moved on to sauv blanc for dinner. Thing 1 and Thing 2 got house made sodas which were pretty tasty and refreshing and not too sweet. They liked them but it may have been because they only get soda once a year.\n\nI had the calamari stuffed with rock shrimp and the filet as a main course. Wife had scallops app and the sea bass. Thing 1 and Thing 2 split the quail and the tomato mozzarella app. \n\nThe standouts. First of all, presentation really means something here so it goes without saying that each plate was a mini work of art. For the food....Tomato mozzarella salad was really good. I know it's so simple to make but the tomatoes were perfect and they were served with the best and creamiest mozzarella I've ever tasted. Oh yeah, the pesto drizzle was pretty exceptional as well. Calamari and scallop apps were outstanding, too. My filet was cooked perfectly and served with a roasted tomato confit on top. On the side there was a really tantalizing bean stir-fry and some really rich (whipping cream?) and savory (bacon fat?) mashed potatoes. One of the best parts of the filet main course were these little crisps scattered amongst the vegetables. They may have been parmesan crisps or something like that. I found a way to get a little piece of crisp into every bite.\n\nDessert? Of course.

Years later it's still here in the city and like a vintage Napa Valley wine, keeps on getting better and better with age!\n\nIf you're flying into San Francisco for business or if you're a leisure traveler who appreciates the markets finest cooking, make sure the boulevard is on your calendar. If you're a European traveler, your best bet for an enjoyable evening is to go to The Boulevard as I've dined at some of the best restaurants in Germany, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands, of which great chefs come from.\n\nI've been dining in San Francisco since 1979 and The Boulevard is on top of my list.  Here's Why:\n\nFood:  \n\n- In order to produce a great dish, you need top quality ingredients and you need to know what you're doing. Believe me, The Boulevard knows what they are doing! When the server placed my dinner on my table , I knew everything was a 10 before I even took a bite.  My last dish was the ANGUS FILET MIGNON , which was WOOD OVEN ROASTED.  The quality of the meat was sensational and nice and tender.  The YUKON GOLD POTATOES were fantastic,  The SPINACH was cooked perfectly and was so good I could have easily finished 3 or 4 side orders of it.  For desert, the DARK CHOCOLATE TART was absolutely delicious as the pastry team here sets the bar for deserts in the city.\n\nService \n\n- The servers at the Boulevard move quickly into and out of their customers table areas but when they come to your table, they make you feel like you're the most important person in the world.  They can describe every item on the menu in more detail than a dictionary and seem quite happy to be working in the best dining room in San Francisco!\n\nAtmosphere\n\n- The atmosphere is so good in here that you're not going to want to leave. The lighting is perfect with an opulent feel throughout the room. Part of the kitchen is open but you hear little noise so can easily carry on a conversation.  There is a charming feel to the place that I have not experienced anywhere else and you can tell from the expressions on the diners as you walk through the restaurant", "author": "Gregg M."}

I heard this place gets pretty busy so make sure you make reservations at least a week in advance, otherwise you'll eat dinner at 10 pm.\n\nWe had the pancetta wrapped rabbit and foie gras for appetizers.  The rabbit was very tasty.  It was cooked to a medium rare so I thought it was slightly chewy.  I think had it been cooked a little more, it would've tasted like chicken.  The foie gras was good but not extraordinary.\n\nI had the halibut.  I thought it was slightly overcooked.  It was seasoned well.  I'm usually pretty hesitant when it comes to ordering fish at an American restaurant because usually it comes out bland.  I thought the sea bass was better.  It had a better consistency, light and buttery.  \n\nMy choice of drink was a limone fizz.  This was delicious and very refreshing!  It's like an alcoholic bubbly lemonade.  \n\nFor dessert, we had the strawberry tart.  This was pretty good.  It was a bunch of strawberries on a flaky pastry.  Think of a round croissant topped with strawberries and a piece of white chocolate.\n\nThe ambiance is warm and dimly lit.  \n\nThe bathroom was a little confusing to get to. You have to go out of the restaurant, pass through a hallway to another door and go downstairs.  Once you're downstairs, you'll have to look around because there are several doors.\n\nOverall it was a nice restaurant with good food, great service, and good ambiance.  The damage for 2 appetizers, 3 glasses of wine, a cocktail, a glass of port, 2 entrees, and a dessert was just over $200.  It's a bit pricey so I would save this place for a special occasion.", "author": "Laina T."}

Any restaurant charging these prices for a meal need to have those items covered.\n\nHere is what we ordered. The starters were FAR tastier and creative than the entrees.\n\nStarters:\n- Ahi Tuna Tartare (quite good, but pretty safe)\n\n- Seared dayboat scallops (same as above)\n\n- Monterey Red Abalone (very tasty & creative, but for 20.00, you barely get 2 bites of the abalone. It's about the size of a silver dollar)\n\nDinner/Entrees:\n\n- Wood Grilles Walu (very tasty, but not very filling)\n\n- Sonoma Duck Breast, pan roasted (tough, chewy & low on flavor)\n\n- Angus Filet Mingnon (quite good, but pretty safe)\n\nDessert:\n- We tried 3 or 4 at the table & they were al pretty forgettable.\n\nI'm not sure what I expected. But their menu used to be so inspired. They had many options for vegetarians. My duck was a TOTAL miss. It was just a chewy mess, and I love duck. If their menu doesn't get an upgrade, I'll be surprised. I'll certainly head back when it does.\n\nOn another note, I was also disappointed that the server was hawking the current cook book. Really? Shall I purchase some girl scout cookies while I'm there too? Come on Boulevard - you can do better.", "author": "Maureen B."}

So, with that said, my review is a review of the establishment as a whole, not just the food. When I pay a good amount of money for a meal, I'm expecting not only a lot out of it, but a flawless meal. \n\nMade a reservation, and when we got there, we were seated right away. The service is very good. We order our meal and got our drinks. Service was not great but it wasn't so slow that I got impatient. I wasn't in a hurry to go anywhere do whatever.\n\nTheir dishes are composed with many elements and multidimensional. The appetizers were great. We ordered a ravioli with a cheese inside that I thought was great, very flavorful and creamy but I feel the other flavors were lost in it. \n\nThe main courses were very disappointing. We ordered everything to share. With that said, we split it in half, and we both came to the conclusion that parts of the dish was very salty. The fish and the sides on the plate was unevenly salted and over salted. Very disappointed, especially for a fish dish that should never be over salted. The vegetables were also very salty. We also ordered a quail to share and to be honest, there was nothing special about it. There were some raviolis that I couldn't figure out what was in it and it was dense. The bird was slightly overdone and tough.\n\nDessert we ordered a butternut squash cake and that was really good. A combination of hot and cold, soft and crunchy. The flavors were good. A little salty, sweet, with a subtle buttery flavor but not too much. \n\nOverall, dessert was my favorite part of the meal but there was nothing else about the meal that made me want to scream for seconds. At an establishment as this place, and the price tag, there are much better places to spend my money on. I will sadly not be coming back.", "author": "Stephy Y."}

So while the food wasn't crazy unique in terms of ingredients or flavors, what Blvd did well was that all dishes were executed with precision and taste.\n\nI started with the Maine Scallops ($16.75)  served with some cream potatoes and heirloom tomatoes. The scallops were seared just perfectly and presented with care and made the hero of the dish as they should be.\n\nFor my main I had the Californian Sea Bass ($34), pan fried with fava beans and potato gratin. As I mentioned earlier, it wasn't anything different in terms of flavor combination but the preparation was perfect. My fillet was seared beautifully golden brown with a touch of crispness, and when you fork through the layers of the fish, it breaks nicely and is tender to the taste. Presentation was impeccable.\n\nDessert was actually my favorite. I couldn't resist the Hummingbird Cake ($10.50). I've personally made this Southern cake but their interpretation took it a bit further with layers of honey & banana cake, spread with hazelnut & pineapple jam, topped with banana mousse frosting, coconut meringue, and paired with pineapple sorbet.

It kinda felt like the show \"Hell's Kitchen\" without Gordan Ramsey cussing everyone out, very cool. The first thing the waiter asked us was if we needed to make it to a show or had any time constraints on the meal that he needed to know about. When we were asked that I was surprised that a restaurant would even ask and try to work with MY schedule. +1 to service\n\nWe ordered:\n\nAppetizer: Lobster Ravioli\nMain Course: Filet Mignon\nMain Course: Lamb\nDrinks: Malbec, and Winter Bliss\n\nThe appetizer only came with 3 pieces however the waiter said that since there were two of us, he would gladly add on another piece so that we could each have 2 at no additional cost! \n\nThe ravioli was perfect! The lobster taste was there and it wasn't mushy or left you wondering if you just ate lobster or crab. This was a delish appetizer that I think all should try!\n\nThe Malbec I ordered with my lamb complimented it well and the Winter Bliss (mixed drink) was not over powering and my extremely light-weight girlfriend who hates the taste of alcohol was able to drink the whole thing!\n\nThe filet and lamb were both cooked perfectly to our liking and I could not have asked for any better service!

The apricots were dressed with an elderflower vinaigrette which toned down the acidity of the fruit perfectly and gave them a lovely floral note. \n\nAnd our waiter Jeff was absolutely wonderful - attentive without being overly obstrusive.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-05-12", "description": "I visited Boulevard on Friday night with two friends that live in the city. I have to say I was little skeptical at first because I had read recent mixed reviews of a lot of \"hype\" with under delivery, but ultimately was convinced by all of the positive recommendations I had received from friends and fellow Yelpers (thanks guys!). Man am I glad we decided to go! When we arrived through the rotating front door we were immediately captivated by the trendy decor, such as the brick style ceiling and stylish lights. It reminded me of a trendy New York restaurant, like something you would see in SOHO. We were seated promptly and greeted by our friendly server who took our drink order. However, when we had questions about some of the wines on the menu, she answered with non-informative, lukewarm, descriptions. Kind of a disappointing start to the evening, but at least it was only the wine list and the only isolated complaint I can offer. She gave us a few minutes to mull over our decision, and we decided on a California red (Prelude Pinot Noir - very good). When it was time to order appetizers, she instantly transformed into a knowledgable foodie who was able to break down all of the dishes! Thank goodness for the transformation, as all of her recommendations that we ended up ordering were great. She had explained that the appetizer selections were on the smaller side, and they were designed to be ordered \"one per person\" to accompany each meal. We opted to order 3 appetizers and share them so we could all try a little sample of each. The first appetizer was the Spicy Sesame Ahi Tuna Tartare. It was very high grade tuna, and it was prepared and tasted exceptional. Next was the Porcini appetizer which was well prepared and tasted good. Finally, we split the Veal Sweetbreads. Wow, these things were good! If you have never had sweetbreads before, or are hesitant on ordering them because of where they come from (animal thymus), put all of that behind you and try them. By far the best appetizer we ordered. For the main course I ordered the Eden Valley Berkshire (Kurobuta) Pork Prime Rib Chop. It was very tender and juicy, and the flavors were perfectly balanced. I also tried a taste of my friend's Pan Roasted Local Wild Salmon. I like fish but I'm not a big fan of Salmon, but this dish was cooked to perfection and tasted fantastic. Finally, I had a small taste of my friend's Wood Oven Roasted Angus Filet Mignon. I wish I would have ordered this one for myself because it was one of the most tender, flavorful, and best prepared filets I have ever tried! You will not regret ordering this one! We decided to skip dessert as it was late and we figured we would end up having a night cap at a local bar in the Mission. \n\nIn conclusion, this was one of the best dining experiences that I have ever had. I would definitely consider myself a foodie, and I enjoy fine cuisine at new restaurants. Expect to pay about $80+ per person, but remember that you get what you pay for. If I could rate this place more than 5 stars I would. This place is definitely worthy of the Michelin rating...\n\nOne last word of advice: Good luck finding the bathrooms! They seem to be a mile away from the dining room and they are not labeled clearly. I thought at one point I had walked through a different restaurant to get to it! Maybe it was just me or maybe that was an intentional part of the \"mystique\", but nonetheless you may want to hold it if you want to get back to your table before dinner arrives!", "author": "Andrew C."}

The prices are standard for this type of establishment.  \n\nPersonally, I'm not a fan of the set up, location, and decor.  It can get pretty loud and very packed.  I call these minor inconveniences, considering the consistent quality of their food.", "author": "Angel S."}

It was worth it. I emailed ahead and got a nice table, but was surprised by the lay out of the \"nice table\". But it's a great people watching area in the restaurant.\nThe food was good, very tasty. The waitress was pleasant, she was willing to answer our questions and take back my bf's drink to the bar when he decided it was too strong :p\nFor a special occasion or just a good date night, I think boulevard is ideal.

The first not a surprise -- San Francisco's food scene attracts talent and creativity...wonderful food is expected to result.  The portions were a little of a surprise -- with a nod to French cuisine, I wasn't sure if this was their way of infusing an \"American\" flair to the menu.  And the footprint was definitely a surprise...it's been a few years since my last visit to SF but I feel like many of my previous experiences were in much smaller more intimate spaces.  \n\nThe good news is the expanse of space becomes much more intimate and charming as you settle into a table with a view of the bridge...at the bar for a cocktail...or seated at the chef's bar watching the controlled chaos of the kitchen as they cook and plate starters, mains, and desserts for you.  With mains looking too overwhelming for me, I chose two items from the starter menu for my meal.  The beet salad with ricotta and hearts of palm was a lovely balance of earthy, smooth creaminess, and a touch of acid at just the right moments to make it all work.  That was followed by a small treat from the kitchen:  a savory cracker with a caviar spread ... delicious!  My \"main\" was the warm lobster starter  -- lobster was sweet and perfectly cooked and framed by a thin slice of panchetta as a base.  Thankfully my \"lighter\" meal allowed for a cheese course -- a cow triple cream, cow and goat blend, and a tangy bleu.  A beautiful finish to a nice meal.\n\nSitting at the chef's bar provided terrific foodie entertainment and a chance to make new friends at the bar.  Don't be intimidated by the menu, space, or dynamic of Boulevard.  The staff is warm...service professional...and you're in for a delightful time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-06", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nI was born \"thirty-something\" years ago (well, now that and 6 days ago, to be accurate).  Last week, a slew of birthday dinners began.  \n\nBirthday dinner #1 was with a bunch of friends who took me out to dinner.  My food friend, Mike, is someone who believes I do not eat anything but pricey food - which is so not true, and Boulevard became the venue.  \n\nI had been hearing all week long, \"YOU have not eaten at Boulevard?  How is that possible?  YOU?\"\n\nYes, me.  In all of these years, I had never dined at this San Francisco icon of a restaurant.  As we discussed this - Rob reminded me that he did make reservations here last year for Valentine's Day, but then ended up taking me to Paris instead.  Yeah - no matter how nice a restaurant may be - Paris wins.\n\nThat said, I was excited to try Boulevard, and our party of 10 sat down at 8:30 PM, after a 30 minute Happy Hour across the street at Americano.\n\nPhotos uploaded.\n\nFirst off - it was a very warm evening in San Francisco - - and the restaurant was downright HOT.  Being sensitive to temperature - I asked everyone at the table and all agreed, it was steaming hot in this restaurant.  The booth we were seated in was roomy and had a nice curved table and bench seat with huge chairs surrounding the table.  \n\nConsidering this dinner was being bought for me, and given what I had heard time and again regarding Boulevard's pricing, I brought two bottles of wine to save a bit on costs - one bottle of a great Chianti, and ol' faithful, a 2004 Joseph Phelps Cabernet.  Saving those for the entrees, we decided to order some bottles of white wine to begin the dinner - and perusing the menu, I noticed the wine prices were decent, as was the selection.\n\nOn the menu was a \"fried abalone\" appetizer, and I knew I'd be opting for that.  Others ordered salads, or scallops, mostly.  Mine was interesting - I have never seen it offered before, but the concept was more interesting than that taste.  The portion was ridiculously small, too.  The scallops were very good, but my take is that the only way to make scallops bad is to overcook them.  They were nicely done at Boulevard.\n\nFor the entree, I opted for the lamb - which was very flavorful, lacking any gaminess, and presented nicely.  Great choice - and several of us had picked this dish.   I did try everyone's else's entrees - including the halibut, filet mignon, and pork.  I was generally  unimpressed with all three - -  the halibut was plain as day, the filet mignon was boring and overcooked by about 45 seconds, and the pork was entirely too salty for my taste, though some disagreed.  They were all \"pretty good\" - but nothing stood out except the lamb.  This is where Boulevard lost the half-star in my book - - you can't be a four-star restaurant without impressive entrees.\n\nThe service was good, but nothing notable.  A restaurant of this caliber has to offer service at least this good - - but there was nothing personal, fun, or unique about it.  Everyone was polite, and our server made recommendations.  We never needed for wine or water refills either.  All in all - a strong 4 stars for the service.\n\nWe then opted to order desserts.\nIt's been a little over a week since I went to Boulevard, and the only dessert I can remember is the chocolate mousse my friend ordered.  That was not just delicious, it was heavenly.  Other than that dessert, the rest faded into the background, though the \"Happy Birthday\" candle and chocolate was appreciated.  The Cafe Americano I ordered was extremely tasty -  great coffee!\n\nNow, having been to Boulevard, I can honestly say that this is a good expense account location.  The restaurant is large, with an excellent location that looks out at the Bay Bridge, that provides \"pretty good\" food with good service.  It makes my date list solely because the ambiance is nice and in spite of being large, it feels intimate.  That said - there was nothing \"special\" about Boulevard.  My tastebuds were ready and excited to get knocked out of this world for the evening, but that failed to happen.\n\nTo be clear, one friend of mine replied to the invite that was sent out with, \"I hate this place but for Grace, I'll be there.\"  On the contrary, another friend who LOVES Boulevard, knowing I had been terribly sick all week long, wrote on the night before to the whole list, \"Um... so Grace has been ill all week.  If she can't go tomorrow night, will the rest of us still be going to Boulevard?\"  (Alright, we know why HE came....ha!)\n\nI should note that despite what I am writing about the food, it is totally appreciated that my friends took me to dinner here.  I am truly glad I tried it, and had a wonderful time.  What they lacked in culinary delights, we made up for in good conversation, excellent wines and lots of laughter.\n\nA good life begins with good friends.\nAnd that, if nothing else, I seem to have.\n\nThanks, guys, for a great evening!

The soup was flavorful and well-balanced, but darker in color and didn't quite have the fine texture as I enjoyed recently at another restaurant (name withheld!).  The squash blossom was deep fried and stuffed with ricotta = yummy.  For the main I had the pork chop:  a very thick cut cooked evenly and with a nice crisp on the outside.  Served with a tiny bit of polenta and some greens tossed to the side.  My partner started with the foie gras and had the California white sea bass -- both of which were very good but below knockouts.  For dessert we had the meyer lemon custard tart.  Very tangy with nice berries.  I quite enjoyed it.  Coffee was ok, nothing to write home about.  \n\nService:  Very attentive and a little general when it comes to recommendations.  I got generic answers when it came to wine and dessert recommendations.  Maybe the wait staff wants to remain neutral?  Guess that's ok.  \n\nAmbiance & Decor:  Lively, with good attention to detail and \"Pat Kuleto's timeless Belle Epoque\" design.  A table for 2 will make it seem more like you're at a Paris streetcorner cafe than a 4-star restaurant.  \n\nOverall:  An enjoyable experience all around, but not the best food or price in town when it comes to high-end restaurants.

My experience here has been one of the best dining experiences I have had to date. \nBoulevard's ambiance is seemingly on the more casual side for fine dining, as there was loud conversation as noise. \nThe biggest downside was that our reservation was for 8pm, but we ended up having to wait until nearly 8:45. Despite that, service was great and once we sat down, the rest of the night went off without a hitch.\nAgain, everything we ordered from appetizer to dessert was amazing. However, of all the dishes we tried, my favorite by far was the Kurobata Rib Pork Chop. UGH, do not miss this. Perfectly cooked with even a small piece of smoked pork belly on top. I wondered if it was unclassy to pick up the rib bone to pick the meat off of it, but I did it anyway because the pork chop was THAT good. \nIt's great to see a restaurant with women at the helm (the owner and chef de cuisine).

I thought the color was off right away and the sommelier's advice was, \"What do you expect?  It's a 17 year old wine\".\n\nHe never came back to check on our table to see if the taste got any better after breathing for a while.\nOur server came back and told us that every once in a while, he has seen people get a bad bottle of this wine.\nWe felt better for at least being checked on by our server.", "author": "Thomas D."}

The gorgeous dining room was deservedly packed and we settled in at a cozy little table by the open kitchen. My ADD was in full effect as I took random glances at Pat Kuleto's impeccable design, Blvd's impressive menu, the bustling kitchen and the beautiful people of San Fran. Our waiter was great and his service for the evening was spot on. He also seemed completely sincere and grateful in accepting the praise of the delectable meal he laid before us. Our dining tour began with Dungeness Crab Salad with Ruby Red Grapefruit, Avocado, Belgian Endive, Kaffir Lime and Poppy Seed Vinaigrette and Italian Buffalo Mozzarella with Marinated Baby Artichokes, Crispy Truffled Fennel Shaved Black & White Truffles, and Wild Arugula. Both were delicious and nice starts to our meal. Every single ingredient was fresh and bursting with flavor. The truffles were amazing and we spent the rest of the meal passing forkfuls of tasty little bites to each other. Oh, you've got to try this! \n\nFor entrees we had the Wood Grilled Walu and the Butter Poached Maine Lobster. These were both memorable dishes and went perfectly with the New Zealand Huia Chardonnay we enjoyed. We finished with the Gingersnap and Pumpkin spiced ice cream sandwiches. There were many tasty things on the menu that also looked great when they went by, like the lamb chops. I don't think you can go wrong here as you are in good hands.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-25", "description": "Michelin restaurant and burnt steak?? It doesn't sound like a winning combo. I wanted to fall in love with this place, I really did.\n\nAfter reading all the rave reviews Yelpers had written about Boulevard's spectacular service and delectable dishes, and because it was Michelin rated, I chose this restaurant over Chaya, a nearby French/Japanese fusion place, to celebrate my birthday. I VERY MUCH REGRET THIS DECISION.\n\nFor starters, after we had been seated, our waiter, Jake, neither bothered to introduce himself (I found out his name when we paid and his name was on the check), ask how we were doing, or explain anything about the restaurant or the menu. He got straight to the point and asked us if we were ready to order. Perhaps I would have been, had I gotten a chance to glance over the menu. In a $5 pho restaurant, that's fine - in a Michelin rated dining experience, it is substandard to rush your dining patrons.\n\nStarted with the Sonoma Foie Gras: I feel exuberant for loving foie gras as much as I do, but over the last couple of years, ever since I first sampled it, I've been in love and have been able to tell the quality and effort put into making it. Loved the fruity accents the strawberries provided, and the duck was so tender - it was a perfect, melt-in-your-mouth texture that contrasted nicely with the black Russian rye toast.\n\nDecided to keep it simple and order filet mignon, a staple in high-end restaurants that never fails to satisfy. Given that filet mignon is the most tender cut of beef and that this restaurant was so hyped, I expected stellar. What I got was a \"medium rare\" piece of cow burnt on both sides, overcooked to the point where it was tiring for me to cut a piece of it, and burnt pieces were flaking off onto my plate. MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT, to say the least. There was little to no flavor in the bites I took because the meat was so dry and burnt. It was certainly not tender like filet mignon is supposed to be, and I wasn't able to finish half of it because it was so tasteless.\n\nThis is where it gets fun: service. Our waiter said nothing to us the entire night. He filled our water one time and got lost in a black hole or something for the rest of our meal. He came back out to give us dessert menus and to give us the check. But I was honestly so surprised at the lack of attention and quality given to my $40 piece of shitsteak that I lost my appetite and didn't end up ordering dessert. I did, however, inquire about the quality of the filet mignon to our waiter. He replied haughtily that Nancy Oakes had been working there for 18 years and that the filet mignon has always been made like this, in an air that allowed for no further questions. I get the impression that since my parents didn't feel like getting buzzed off wine and that we were Asian, he immediately stereotyped us cheap fobs whom he was beneath serving, which is why he was neglectful and indirectly rude.\n\n...THAT was what really annoyed me. I'm not at Burger King or a Chinese hole-in-the-wall, where I don't care about service. Service is a bigger and bigger part of the overall experience as the restaurant's reputation and quality increase. In a restaurant so praised for quality service and a fulfilling culinary experience, calling our waiter's patronizing tone, cold attitude, and lack of attention to our party subpar would be a huge understatement. I would have brought it up with their manager, save for the fact that he gave me the impression that every employee was as poor-mannered as himself, and I just didn't want to get into it on my birthday. My parents have tipped up to 25-30% for outstanding service. Let's just say that Jake fell short of those stats.\n\nBoulevard, I sincerely hope you improve. I wanted to love you so much... you seemed so amazing. But as my friends would say about certain men, you're only HFFA (Hot From Far Away).", "author": "Chrystal Z."}

I took one star off this time for two reasons:  First, we made an early reservation and I guess because of the busy holiday time our food took a while because the kitchen was juggling between two large parties.  Second, I ordered the filet and it was labeled \"umami\"  I was so hyped about this and then letdown.  Maybe it because I ordered medium rare, but still it was nothing exciting and didn't leave me craving more.  It was just too meaty and didn't have the flavor I wanted.  I almost was going to say something but that would be mean a long wait.  It wasn't bad, just did \"wow\" me.  My wife had the pork chops and they were amazing.

They have a very nice drink - alcoholic and nonalcoholic - menu. The cucumber gimlet and Moscow mule's looked especially delicious. Being pregnant, I ordered the Specialty Lemonade and it was refreshing. We had the appetizers of the beet salad, sea scallops, and calamari. All of it was very good. The calamari was the best in my personal opinion. For the entrees, I had the halibut, and my cousins had the pork loin, quail, and the lamb. Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals and it all looked so good. The halibut was very good, and definitely recommended. After the entrees, we decided to do some of their desserts. We shared the local alpine and seascape strawberries, chocolate buckwheat shortcake, and butterscotch pudding. Everything was really good.

Never.  \n\nThe food is spectacular, the view of the Bay Bridge is beautiful, and the service is impeccable every time.  I'd say my most memorable meal at the restaurant was when I took my friend, Scott, here for his 50th birthday lunch a couple of years ago.  I made a reservation and requested a quiet corner table with a view.  Boulevard delivered in spades!  \n\nWe had a huge corner table with a view of the bridge and we felt very secluded and comfortable as we celebrated Scott's 50th birthday.  Most of all, everyone from the hostess to the waiter understood the special occasion and made our visit very special.\n\nWe were scheduled to watch a matinee of Wicked that day so I told our waiter that time was of the essence.  The service was phenomenal.  We each had 3 courses and then shared his birthday dessert.  All of our selections were delicious.  I tried some of Scott's food and it was divine.  But it was my meal that I remember most vividly.\n\nI started with the ahi tartare.  It was a delectable starter that was beautifully presented.  It was followed by the lobster bisque.  Oh my, oh my, oh my...  Yum!!!  And to think I wasn't even going to order it.  But Scott was torn between ordering the lobster bisque or a salad.  I told him to order both.  He was hesitant.  So when the waiter took our order, I decided to order the lobster bisque as an extra course for myself.  Okay, I was going to share with the birthday boy too!  LOL.  \n\nBut when Scott saw that I ordered 3 courses, he contemplated ordering the lobster bisque himself.  Of course, he asked our waiter if the soup came in a cup or a bowl.  Oh Scott!!!  This is Boulevard not a diner!  I tried very hard not to laugh out loud.  It was actually very cute.  It was one of those unforgettable moments when you realize why you're friends with someone.  Scott could always make me laugh...sometimes intentionally and sometimes (like this time) unintentionally.  The waiter kindly explained that it came in a shallow bowl plate.  The waiter was very gracious about it all.    \n\nScott then asked our waiter if he thought 3 courses was too much food.  Both the waiter and I said \"no\" at the same time.  To be fair, I was used to dining at Boulevard and am keenly aware of the serving sizes.  This was Scott's first time at the restaurant.\n\nThe lobster bisque was fabulous.  Simply fabulous!  It's one of my favorite dishes there.  It's creamy yet subtle.  It's the best lobster bisque I've ever had.  Seriously, if you go to Boulevard and it's on the menu, you have to try it.  It's awesome!\n\nMy main entree were the lamb chops.  I love lamb and these were perfectly cooked medium rare chops just the way I like them.

It was definitely popping as the Prince of Taiwan walked through the door and was greeted by the hostess. As I surveyed the room, I really had to think to myself..\"where is this damn recession?\" You had people of every ilk and color eating away at their food like starving Chinamen at my local Moonstar buffet and it seems like money was raining everywhere. When we were seated, i noticed to my right that were two tourists from Texas seemingly spending their money on bottles and bottles of wine like there was no tomorrow. I was surprised the manager didn't come out and lick the guy's butt for being so spend-y. \n\nThere was so much money abound that the Prince of Taiwan felt like he was from North Korea instead...and that is a sad thing to say.\n\nFor the Apps we tried the boudin and lobster and the little gem salad with Green Goddess dressing.

I also came here for my 20th birthday with my dad and brother and the experience was wonderful then as well. \n\nHad an 8:15pm reservation Friday, 12/16/11. Arrived at about 8:10pm. We had to wait about ten or fifteen minutes for our table though as my boyfriend had requested a seat near the windows, but Boulevard is such a magnificently beautiful restaurant and is even more stunning when its decorated for Christmas, that its quite pleasant to sit and just take in the surroundings. I ordered a drink from the bar, a Mojito. Best damn Mojito I have ever had. \n\nWhen we got our table we we discovered that our waiter was the same waiter we had had for my birthday the previous year! We told him this and he was very excited, and asked us if we had enjoyed ourselves last year to which I replied, \"Well we wouldn't be back this year if it hadn't been!\" He said he thought he remembered us, which I believe would be a bit of a stretching of the truth, I mean it was a year ago. Its not like we're there every Friday night. Anyways, this excited him enough that he brought us each an amuse bouche, \"Compliments of the house\". Super yummy!!! It had plain yogurt, glazed and caramelized granola, a mandarin orange section, and a few other things, which I can't even explain, but OMG it was a slice of heaven. So that was awesome. \n\nFor appetizer we split the crab salad with comes with fresh heart of palm. The other two times I have been there this salad has come with tiny pieces of lime. This time I didn't detect any lime, but there were some slices of grapefruit. It was delicious. \n\nFor the main course we each got the fillet Mignon. I know I need to branch out and try new things, but why bother if it's so good?! This if the best fillet Mignon in the world. Hands down. In fact, I dare you to try and find one cooked better. Cooked medium rare this fillet could be cut with a spoon it is so tender. I could go on and on, and in fact I think I may have just drooled all over my laptop after writing this. Its just THAT good, trust me on this. It arrived on a bed of perfectly cooked spinach and fingerling potatoes. The potatoes were very large for fingerling, but super yummy. \n\nFor dessert we had the Dreamsicle Brulee. It had a Meyer lemon meringue whipped topping, which was tart and tasty. The creme brulee was amazing, it had a sort of orange gel bottom which was a nice surprise on the bottom of the brulee bowl. It also came with a Meyer lemon sorbet sandwich. Also delicious. Boyfriend also had a cinnamon ice cream bonbon. He said it was great, so I believe him. \n\nEveryone here is so wonderful and amazing, the service has always been excellent. It really is an art form, even watching the busers clear the table, they do it a certain way and there is something interesting about it. \n\nI highly recommend this restaurant. Always a pleasure.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

I had kobe beef in NY this past march and it tasted the exact same. Just a perfectly cooked burger. Nice and juicy. ...no complaints, but no accolades either. The fries we amazing though! Never have I tasted fries that good in my life. The best hands down. What blew my mind though was the desert. \n\nI had the black forest ice box cake and after one bite i felt as if everything in the world had no tangible meaning or worth. What was this flavourful concoction that the gods decided to send to my table? So many different flavors so perfectly paired, i had no idea what to do. I have never take so much time to finish a dessert as i did that day.

The decor, views (at a table in the back), and the service (Alisha is the best waitress ever! If you get her, it's your lucky day) were all remarkable.  O, yea we ate food there too... Every dish was prepared perfectly, looked amazing, was very flavorful with various textures, and every single ingredient added something to each dish.  So much so that we went back the very next night.  All in all we had most of the menu in those 2 nights and no plate had anything left on it after any course. The second night Alisha even brought us a small bite before our appetizers, and it was not something given to every table (we watched!), and were also treated to a free glass of wine after being a repeat customer... Just another thing that made this a great dining experience.\n\nIf you are a person that appreciates a good dining experience, and are not one of those \"well everyone says its amazing, so I'm going to try hard to find something bad about it\" people...

Needless to say, this is not an intimate quiet restaurant. Take a look at the vaulted brick ceilings when you enter the rotating door.

Served with different varieties of cut beats with nuts and a light dressing the beets were purely spectacular--with a taste so fresh and crisp. A great way to start the the night.\n\nNext up was their pork chop. Served atop a bed of what appeared to be mini gnocchi pieces and spinach, the pork was juicy and seared to perfection with rich flavors.\n\nI topped off dinner with a nice chocolate cake and cream--and in my book a chocolate cake with a lava center is a good cake!

I was on-call so I couldn't have any alcohol -- hence the lemonade. Both the plain and the strawberry-mango were way too sweet. Like, teeth-shatteringly sweet. Only after letting the ice melt into them for half and hour did the drinks become more tolerable. My friend's pinot, however, was quite good (so he said, anyway).\n\nThe appetizers were also so-so. The tuna tartare was tasty but an awfully small portion. The lobster ravioli was especially disappointing -- a little dry, lukewarm, and although filled with plenty of lobster meat, the meat itself was tougher than even lobster should be.\n\nFortunately, the entrees were terrific. I had the sea bass, which was expertly pan-fried and paired with the most delicious artichoke hearts I've ever had. My friends' entrees were even better. The duck breast in particular was incredible, with liver wrapped in duck skin on the side that was just rich enough without being too fatty.\n\nThe service was also excellent. Waters and bread were refilled promptly, and not once did I feel we were waiting unreasonably long for attention. And the space! There's an old money, almost Southern quality to the restaurant that's a nice contrast to ultra-modern settings like Luce or low-lit, intimate dining rooms like Gary Danko's.

For others it might be, but I'm not a huge fan of a) cala fish (?) and b) calamari unless it's deep fried with lots of dipping sauce. But it was delicious Cameron! So 4 and a 1/2 stars. \n\nThe SERVICE was amazing. Patrick, our bartender and the barback that would set up our utensils after every course, were just superb. He asked for our IDs and said, \"You have a youthful air about you\" *squeals* I don't look as old as I feel when I'm wearing these glasses!

It was pretty standard but the prices were pricier than other restaurants\nSonoma Foie Gras - Good, one of the better foie gras I've had but I can probably get just as good foie gras somewhere else. However, was still a winner for me but I'm not fan of the decorative foam that all these fancy restaurants are doing. I don't get the appeal. The grapefruit was a nice complement\nLiberty Farms Duck Breast - My favorite dish of the night. Really tender, rich, savory, delicious, you name it. It was also my mom's favorite dish. \nHalibut - I'm not a huge fan of halibut but this one was pretty good. Really light in comparison to the duck but delicious. \nRoasted Pork Prime Rib Chop - Just as good as the duck but with a different flavor. Really meaty and savory. \nFor dessert, I forget the name but it had nuts, whip cream, chocolate icecream, and Pepperidge farm cookies. It was delicious but a slightly heavier dessert. \n\nOverall, I'm glad I finally got to try this place and cross it off my list.", "author": "Diana Y."}

Last week we took our company out to S.F. and walked along the waterfront before our dinner reservation.  We we're lucky to get table in the back to enjoy the lights upon the bay bridge.  But I give this view to our guests, and enjoy the looking down this bustling restaurant with all the beautiful ornamentation.  Being a designer I can never get enough visual stimulation, and ever surface here is covered with something to admire.  \n\nFor an appetizer I shared the scrumptious rabbit ravioli and heirloom tomato salad (always a favorite for me) with my husband, this way we can taste as many of the dishes as possible.  My quail entr\u00e9e with the gnocchi and mushrooms was cooked perfectly, while my husband got the heavier pork prime rib chop with chard, so moist and flavorful. We always leave room to split a dessert, and were glad to get the delectable peach crisp before its season is over, we could barely finish it.  Just when I think I can't possibly eat another bite out comes the chocolate bon bon, which we manage to slip down.  \n\nTo me the service is just the right balance of precisely attentive & friendly, but never stuffy.  I only wish they would serve a better Chai tea, since I'm not a coffee drinker, but their other brewed teas are great, and I love the little dishes for every kind of sugar or honey you could imagine, makes me feel like I'm ending the evening with a mini tea party.", "author": "Jennie G."}

I kept thinking my taste buds must have been damaged...but my husband agreed.  The waiter obligingly sent me a crab salad, which was comprised of a ball of flavorless crab (?) in mayonnaise (?) with one tiny piece of fresh crab, a chunk of avocado and a blood orange dressing.  I started to feel as though the dinner so far tasted canned.  Then I ordered a cod entree with risotto.  The small piece of cod was slightly overcooked and the risotto was delicious.  ($34).

My company for the night, my fellow yelper and buddy Cherylynn N. =) We were both running late due to traffic and parking. Parking was a little hectic but I was lucky and found parking about two blocks away, the unlucky part was the fact that it was raining and I didn't have an umbrella. (The restaurant has valet). \n\nWhen we walked through the through the doors and entered the restaurant, to our surprise the place was pretty packed for a weekday so make sure you have reservations because throughout the night it stayed steadily packed and tables kept getting filled. Though we were late for our reservations, we were still seated right away.\n\nOn to the reasons that makes this review a review, for drinks I ordered the Classic Eggnog (warm eggnog with brandy). The Classic Eggnog was really good, it had a slight burn when it was going down your throat. =P For appetizer, the most talked about dish: Foie Gras with Yuzu Marmalade & Persimmons. The foie gras was actually bigger than I thought it would be, I was expecting something the size of an eraser. =X The foie gras just melted in my mouth but when I tried the bread with it, it had a weird taste because of the sweetness of the bread and like Cherylynn said the bread was \"dense.\" The main course of the night was the filet mignon, which I actually don't have much to say for. It was pretty good but I think I've had better else where. You can't end a meal without DESSERT!! We shared the Fromage Cheesecake with Pistachio Crust & Lemon Sherbet. The cheesecake was really light and had a nice texture and the pistachio crust was flakey and flavorful. YUM! \n\nThe service was a bit slow, probably due to the high foot traffic of the restaurant. Our entrees took well over 30 minutes after getting our appetizers to come out. Good service, our server came to check up on us every now and then. =) Overall I enjoyed dining here but there were some things that turned me off and away from giving this place 5 stars.", "author": "Heather C."}

Made a reservation days in advance, but had to wait. This happens EVERY SINGLE TIME. Of course you are \"invited\" to spend some money at the crowded, two row-deep bar. We said no. This did not please the snooty hostess, which then proceeded to ignore us. After seated the waiter was ok, but not, again, what we used to experience in other times. AND the food was definitely very low level. ALL dishes (3 people) were heavy, unremarkable and NOT AT ALL what you may expect from a restaurant that USED TO BE GOOD.\nWhen you seat 180, things go bad quickly at the kitchen, and they just keep going on the past shine of a gone glory.\nBye-bye, Boulevard, you were a nice place years ago; too many good choices in SF to endure your now stale, ill-prepared food and hostesses' attitude.", "author": "Gabriel S."}

The Ferry Building as well as a few other great restaurants are nearby so parking in the area is nothing short of impossible. Thankfully I know my way around the Muni tracks so my friend and I only had to walk a couple blocks from the nearest stop. \n\nI'm from the Bay Area but I've lived in LA for a while now (same goes for my friend). We're used to sunny days all year so we're both extremely thin blooded. The short walk to Boulevard's entrance made us shiver and shake uncontrollably (it was about 50 degrees). Brrrr. After going through the revolving door we instantly warmed up due to the cozy atmosphere and obviously because the heat was on, thank god. We then began the timely task of peeling off our fifty million layers before we got heat stroke. \n\nWe didn't have a reservation so we were given the choice between sitting at the chef's table or on the bar side. We chose the bar side which didn't have anything wrong with it. The only thing that separated us from the reserved tables was a waist-high wall. Who cares. We enjoyed our table. Plus we got to watch the bartenders furiously mix drinks and poor wines. Neat. \n\nWe had reservations for an early dinner so we were planning on eating a light lunch. I asked our server what he would recommend and he said splitting a soup or salad and splitting an entree would be perfect for us. We ordered the Lobster bisque and the American Kobe beef burger (with heirloom tomato, house made bun, little gem lettuce, Cowgirl Creamery's wagon wheel cheese, and French fries) to split. The lobster bisque was extremely heavy so the small serving size was perfect. Also, dipping the table bread (San Francisco sourdough) in the soup was to die for. The burger was a smaller size too, but because it was Kobe beef it was very filling. The patty was mouthwateringly juicy. When I cut the burger in half the juices came out and soaked the bottom of the bun. Delicious, but gross. Gross because I absolutely hate getting my hands dirty. Even when eating a burger I usually only use my pointers and thumbs to hold it. Delicious because... well juicy burgers are just plain awesome. The fries were also great. The were crunchy on the outside with a warm, soft inside. The ketchup (which I'm guessing was made in house) complimented the fries perfectly. \n\nOn the way out of the restaurant there's a perfect view of the Bay Bridge along with the Ferry Building and the piers. The Embarcadero is a nice walk, especially if you don't live in the city. Just be sure to bring plenty of layers and a couple hand warmers so you don't lose a finger to frost bite.", "author": "Kevin R."}

The filet was cooked to perfection, just the right amount of seasoning/sauce and just the right amount of rareness. For dessert I had the strawberry/watermelon ice cream cake. It sounds simple, but it wasn't. There were many layers to the cake, and I loved how all the flavors of the different layers tasted together. I left super happy, and ready to go back again. I'm already planning my next meal there! \n\nOne thing to watch out for - if your server asks you if you want a bottle of water, they mean the fancy bottled water that will cost you $8 a bottle, not that they will bring you a bottle with water in it. We had just sat down when she asked us and we didn't think about it til it was too late. We felt a little tricked, but admitedly it was our fault we should have said we wanted tap water.

It took a while to park the car, we had to call the restaurant to find out that the valet is actually on Stuert.  Keep that in mind if you're driving there.\n\nWe ate at Fleur de Lys last week so it was nice to have good food that didn't break the bank.  Boulevard proves that you can have a nice filling meal that tastes great without being too chi-chi.  It's a bit dressy, but I didn't have to wear a jacket.\n\nThe food, oh the food,\n\nApps:  The wife ordered the calamari stuffed with rock shrimp, servered with fingerling potatoes and chorizo.  I had the dungeness crab salad with avocado and blood oranges.  The apps arrived very quickly, 5-10 minutes after we ordered, which was nice since I was starving.  Both dishes were delicious.  Be warned, the appetizers are big, the neighboring table ordered lobster ravioli and got 4 huge lobster filled pasta pockets.\n\nMains:  Sea bass with chanterelle mushrooms and mashed potatoes for the wife, pork chop with potatoes and swiss chard for me.  I preferred the pork, it was sweet and a little tangy.  Each thing on my plate tasted so great that I ate them individually, I didn't want to mix the flavors.  The sea bass was good too, but the pork....\n\nDessert:  By now I'm completely stuffed, ready to skip dessert.  The server brought dessert menus and in a moment that can only be described as pure gluttony we ordered the greek yogurt cheesecake.  It came with a gingerbread ice cream sandwich.

It's absolutely delicious, and though we were hesitant at first to order a dish we could get at any other restaurant, it was the best decision. It's grilled instead of fried and all the flavors combined was just perfect. For entrees, I had the Pacific Swordfish and he ordered the Alaskan Halibut. I'd strongly recommend you to order seafood at Boulevard - they make some damn good seafood. I actually liked the Halibut a lot better (we traded mid-meal) because it melts in your mouth and is grilled perfectly. The Pacific Swordfish comes with potatoes & dip, which was incredible. The Swordfish, according to my boyfriend, was really good as well. I think it just didn't suit me. We finished off the dinner with chocolate brulee and white-peach sorbet, both of which were good. Typically not a chocolate lover, I still ate a good portion of the 3 mini brulees. \n\nAmbiance: The service honestly was a bit slow.

This place was packed... even at 9!! Hostess was extremely nice and let us know that our table will be ready in a couple minutes... even though it's more like 15-20, it was OK cuz I got to see what everyone was having.. and you know if you want good things, you gotta be patient and wait.. Finally got out table near the back where you could see the Bay Bridge.. Awesome view..\n\nWe started with:\n*Ahi Tuna Tartare: Wasabi Tobiko, Miso Mayo, Cocktail Grapefruit with Lotus Root Chips and Crispy Nori ($17)\n   There were three small portion squares with all three toppings on each one. My favorite? the Miso Mayo.. Not a strong miso smell/flavor but enough to taste it.. If you could get the whole thing to yourself, I highly suggest you do.. \n*Local Calamari Stuffed with Crab ($16.50)\n  It came with a little side of fried stuff but wasn't sure what,, I know there were fries rosemary and I was hesitating if I should eat that but I did and it was really good.. Th calamari stuffed with crab was awesome.. No skimping on crab. I only wished that there were more then two so instead of getting one small bite, we get one whole thing for $16.50..\n\nFor my entree, I had the Angus Filet Mignon ($39.75)\n  It was served with sauteed spinach, crispy fingerling potatoes, and red wine beef jus. The steak itself was a little more cooked then I wanted it to be so it was a little too dry. I mostly fed my BF the meet so I filled up more on the spinach and potatoes.. \n\nDessert time is here!\n*Almond Butter Cake: Extra Dark \"Hot Cocoa\" Ice Cream with House made Toasted Marshmallow Marcona Almond Araguani Chocolates\nBlood Orange Sorbet ($10.75) \n  Great plating! It looked good even when I didn't take a bite of it yet. The almond cake was moist and had a good almond flavor. I loved the marshmallow. Makes me want to make some myself right now, The extra dark \"Hot Cocoa\" ice cream was too dark. Flavor wise.. I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate.. \n*Sticky Toffee Pudding with a Caramel Custard Top\n  Earl Grey Tea Ice CreamCandied Kumquats, Almond Biscotti ($10.75)\n  Almond biscotti was DELICIOUS.. Probably one of the best I've tried so far.. I liked this dessert more the the Almond cake one.. The taste was just better.. Caramel Custard top was smooth and creamy... \n*Fleur de Sel Caramel Bon Bon ($3.50)\n  I should of saved the $3.50 cuz I could of made it myself. =)\n\nThe bill was expensive! 3 shots of Remy was fucken $67!!!!! My fucken goodness, I could of just bought a bottle for myself! With tips, it came to about $102 each! The portions are definitely on the small side and expensive!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-29", "description": "So with the Michelin guide coming out this last Tuesday, I decided that I was going to eat at every Michelin starred restaurant in California to see if Michelin actually knows what they are talking about.  My first restaurant to review is Boulevard.\n\nIt's funny because most dining experiences for me come on a whim.  We were in the city, watching the world series, my friend had just been jumped by scalpers and we were in desperate need for some truly delicious food.  We got there at 9:00 o'clock and Boulevard was completely full, which is to be expected.  We sat in the bar until 9:30 (our reservation was at 9:15, no big deal) and were escorted to the table.  One of the first things that I noticed about this place was that some of the hostesses never smile.  The wait staff was very pleasant but there was something completely off-putting about the hostesses.  \n\nWe decided on on doing 5 course, gluttonous to say the very least, but we hadn't eaten all day and we're starving.  The food here is classic Michelin star food, if that makes any sense.   There are no frills, no attempts to exceed what have been doing for years, and I guess that's OK with me.  There's something to be said about maximizing your strengths, over coming your weaknesses and producing good, but not great food. Let's do a breakdown of what I had.\n\nHeirloom salad with mozzarella: Sadly, one of the best, if the not best dish of the evening.  Seasoned to perfection, there's something truly magical about the acidity of tomatoes and how it interacts with mozzarella.\n\nAbalone: Proclaimed to be one of the signature dishes.  Was just OK for me.  The accoutrement's were too plentiful and overshadowed the beautifully cooked Abalone.  There was a tangy flavor to the dish which was slightly odd, and it lacked a distinct bite (acid) which was needed to make this dish memorable.\n\nDungeoness Crab Salad: - Nothing special, again lacked acid.\n\nPotato Gnocchi and Lobster:  The lobster was fantastic, cooked beautifully, the gnocchi was masterfully prepared, soft and delicate. The tomato on the dish, to me wasn't needed.  This dish really hit the spot and whoever cooked it probably deserves a raise\n\nPolenta, White Truffle, Slow Cooked Egg:  I wanted this dish to be amazing, it was just OK  for me.  The temperature was off, it was luke warm which is a HUGE problem.  The texture of the polenta lacked viscosity, and when served with the slow cooked egg, it made it mushy as if I was supposed to drink it with a straw.  The white truffles were fragrant, fresh, and are always reliable.  \n\nAlaskan Halibut with Squash Risotto:  The risotto, unlike the polenta was cooked beautifully, was seasoned very well and complemented the tempura squash blossom exceptionally.  The halibut was a little overcooked, but it was still, in my opinion delicious.\n\nLamb with potatoes:  The lamb was the shining star on the menu.  I hate lamb, I really do, but they cooked it perfectly.  It had tremendous flavor and showed some beautiful skill.  The potatoes were definitely inconsistent.  There were three fingerling potatoes on the dish, all three had different flavors and were cooked unevenly.  It was very strange.\n\nBon-Bons with Banana Ice Cream and Butterscotch: I am not a dessert person.  It was OK.  Nothing special.\n\nOverall the service was solid, they described the menu well.  They marked the tables.  They did clear plates while people were sill eating, which I thought was really odd and a faux pas to say the very least.  I kind of got the feeling that if I were there at 7pm instead of 9:30pm the quality of the food would have been better.  You know they always say, \"FINISH STRONG\" and that truly describes what did not happen here at Boulevard.\n\nParty of 2 = $500 with tip.\n\nMichelin Star deserved: YES\n\nI guess the guide got it right on this one..One down 43 to go...", "author": "Shaun C."}

It fell a bit short of my expectations.  3.5 stars.\n\nWe started out with the appetizer special, a risotto with burrata cheese and a generous amount of white truffles shaved on top.  This dish was quite good and very flavorful.  Our other appetizer was the day boat scallops with roasted cauliflower which was a colorfully presented dish with great quality scallops and vegetables used in the dish.  My entree was the pork prime rib chop topped with pomegranate seeds, super thinly sliced grapes, diced celery and with a side of a sweet apple-like sauce and a side of perfectly roasted and seasoned fingerling potatoes -- it was good.  I also had a healthy portion of the sea bass entree that sat on a bed of shaved brussel sprouts and shallots -- this entree was probably a little better than the one I ordered.  For desserts it was the alpaco chocolate cake and the key lime pie with strawberry sorbet and margarita granita (tangy and salty margarita flavored crushed ice) and topped with fresh strawberries.  The desserts were pretty good overall, not especially sweet and not exactly satisfying that sweet tooth hankering I had after my meal.\n\nFresh ingredients and good food, but not very imaginative dishes and nothing that would have broadened the horizons of your palate.

'11 was the first time that w-s sourced terra de promissio fruit and i'm sure it won't be the last. the wine was incredibly fragrant, balanced with a long finish. terra de promissio is located in the petaluma gap, not that far from the city. it's the home of some incredible vineyards. if you want to give a p-gap pinot a try, check out clary ranch's website. corkage was $30.\n\nservice was the absolute minimum to get us through the meal. order, bring food to the table, \"how is everything?\", check. \n\nnow for the ambiance. the customers are a mix of business types, tourists and locals. attire ranges from sharp to people who looked like they just got done mowing their lawn. there were two guys sitting at the end of the kitchen counter wearing white tee shirts with corporate \"advertising\". the one with his back to me was in my line of sight every time i looked over my wife's left shoulder. so all night long i read \"what do you know about your competition?\" over and over. kind of how you re-read a ketchup bottle label when you're at a diner. at least the tee shirts looked pretty clean.\n\nrather than leaving with a memorable experience i left, i don't know, kind of, sort of, let me think, angry. i've been to boulevard before so i know what they're capable of, hence the three stars.", "author": "Sanil S."}

At this price and at this rating, you really have to own at your game, and Boulevard doesn't.\n\nI know part of it is luck and timing, and I certainly don't seem to have either of those. The food has always been impeccable, which is what is earning this place its 3 stars and no less from me (but really deserves 5). But the service on the other hand, something that you expect to get at this high price point, is quite lackluster.\n\nI have been here several times, and each time some serious problem will happen. I keep going back due to such favorable reviews from Yelp and close friends, hoping that management has nicked the problems in the butt, but alas, no shift.\n\nLet me give you an example. I will preface this to say that we know quite a bit about wine. We have had wine from all price ranges, and we go to wineries several times a month and wine bars all the time. I'm savvy to the attributes used to describe wine, and while I'm super adventurous and will try anything, I also know what I like and I can describe it well.\n\nThis one time we sat in the bar area for a dinner since we had no reservations (no prob, this place is hot, I don't mind at all), and our waitress was excited that we wanted to order a bottle of wine and there was only 2 of us (it was a date night on the weekend). We were unfamiliar with some areas of the wine menu, and since there was no sommelier in sight, she offered us some of her own suggestions. Fantastic! I love hearing what people at an establishment like. She said \"I don't know if you like barnyard, but this has a hint of it.\" Having had wines that tasted of a farm before, we were adventurous and willing to try it. She said over and over and over again (almost in an annoying way too) that if we didn't like it, there would be no harm done and she'd take the bottle back.\n\nHOLY BAT SHIT BATMAN! Did they let the cow drop his turds in with the grapes during crush? Did they use a special dung yeast during fermentation? This thing was like drinking filtered and pasteurized goat poop. I'm not exaggerating one bit.\n\nThus, we returned the only bottle we've ever returned in our lives, and profusely apologized for doing so as we were embarrassed that it was so bad that we actually had to return it. The waitress looked shocked, as if we committed a crime in their establishment, and even though she was the one who kept pushing that we could return it, she seem flustered and bothered that we actually took her up on it.\n\nThe remainder of the night was quite ruined. We hadn't even received appetizers, dinner, or desert yet, but as they came out one by one, everyone began to treat us unkindly. No one was more rude than our waitress though, as it was made incredibly clear that we were making her night uncomfortable. Maybe she had to pay for the bottle out of her tips, but that seems unlikely, and frankly far from our fault.\n\nI will not give up entirely, as I'll eventually succumb to social pressures to revisit, but it won't be without hesitation and a bit of residual anger due to how we were treated.", "author": "Kevin E."}

The seafood salad was good nothing really memorable.\n\nWe ordered the filet mignon and the pork prime rib for our entrees.  The pork prime rib chop was very good.

Our party of three were seated in the back corner, along the windows looking out onto the Embarcadero; whether it was because we were dressed nicely (shirts and dark slacks) or whether that was the only table open, I can't say.\nWe started with a cocktail - I had the cucumber gimlet, which was amazingly refreshing and very tasty. The vodka martinis ordered by the rest of my party were apparently also good.\n\nThe menu appears to change every night and there are no specials, so what I ordered may not be on the menu, but to start I had the sweet sea scallops, which were fabulous. They were topped with jalapeno or some sort of spicy pepper and the dish was great - the scallops were perfectly cooked, not over or underdone.

The sauce that accompanied it was the perfect combination of tangy/sweet and brought out the sweetness of the lobster.  The gnocchi's were unlike gnocchi's I had ever had before.  This dish was so simple, yet the perfect execution made it so delightful to eat.\n\nRabbit ravioli:  Tasty, but nothing spectacular; especially when having it AFTER the Maine lobster appetizer.  It paled in comparison.  Also, i was thrown off by the name.  I was under the impression that they were rabbit-STUFFED ravioli.  But no, they were marinara-ish stuffed ravioli with the tiniest, albeit tasty, morsel of rabbit on the side.  This is the one dish I would not reorder.\n\nWagyu Beef: perfectly marbled.  With every bite, the juiciness came oozing and coated every corner of my mouth (get your mind out of the gutter).  Thinking about it makes my mouth water.  This is as flavorful a piece of meat is going to get.\n\nLamb T-bone: lamb is definitely one of my favorite proteins.  This is THE best lamb, I've ever had, hands down.  I enjoy the taste of game meat, but i know a lot of people don't.  this lamb had NO hint of gamy-ness whatsoever. Ahh, perfectly cooked.  the outside was perfectly grilled to give it a slight crisp, and the inside was perfectly moist and tender.\n\nWARM Valrhona Alpaco Chocolate Cake:  This was a buzz-kill. First of all, the cake did not arrive to us warm.  The edges were hardened, the inside dry.  I had a couple of bites and was over it.  My date and I didn't finish it and we ALWAYS finish our desserts.\n\nDrinks: Chateauneuf du Pape, Zinfandel/Malbec Blend, Pellegrino, Weaver's coffee.  I was thrilled with our wine choices; they complimented our meats very well.  I had never heard of Weaver's, but it was excellent and I drank mine black.  And the Pellegrino, well, it tasted like Pellegrino :P\n\nConclusion: This is the best food experience in the city I've had so far.  The decor, ambiance, and atmosphere of Boulevard is relaxed yet retains a certain elegance.  Service was excellent--the dishes never came too fast or too slow and our waitress was chill and down to earth.

It came with wonderful mushrooms,spinach, and gnocchi.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and came again with nice sauces and sides.  The lamb was delicious and came with a mysterious but tasty sauce (gooseberries? capers?).  We would have enjoyed more veggies.  \n\nWe got both cheese and dessert.  The cheese was disappointing, hard and undistinguished, when we were expecting soft and gooey; but perhaps it was our ignorance in ordering.  We got a dessert involving several forms of both apricot and chocolate .  It was beautifully decorated with chocolate lace, had a crunchy chocolate cylinder around the mousse, sorbet, fruit, jellies, sauce...really nice. \n\nSome people think this place is very overpriced, we thought differently.

The dinner was long and leisurely but I am going to make this short and sweet. \n\nThe waiter was an interesting character, old school service, but a little overbearing with his recommendations- I'll get to this in more detail.\n\nI think we tried every appetizer/small plate and they were all very small but outstanding. Flavors blended seamlessly and were delicious. This definitely turned out to be the strong point of the entire meal.\n\nWe moved on to our entrees. I am a mostly vegetarian who just recently began eating meat when it is of very high quality (local, sustainable farm, grass fed, etc). I was excited to get the Filet Mignon. There were few meats I missed while being vegetarian for almost 10 years and steak was one of them. I like my steak pretty medium rare and a little bloody. The waiter insisted that all of their meats are basically cooked a level under what you order. He said medium rare is \"medium\" there and said if I ordered it medium rare, it would come practically raw. He really made it sound drastic and as if I would be disappointed, yet if I just order \"medium\" it would be perfectly how I wanted it. It was so simple... There's nothing worse than an overcooked steak so I was very hesitant but he finally convinced me to order it medium (it was also feeling like it would have been rude to go against his expertise and still order it medium rare). Well, needless to say, my steak came out and it was cooked medium. I was so disappointed. It was barely even pink and only in certain parts. It was a true medium, with no rare to be found. Not exactly what I had dreamed of in my $50 steak. We've cooked ourselves better steaks at home from Bi-Rite.\n\nDesserts were good and the appetizers out-shined the entrees.

The Banquet Manager, Pamela and her team, help me put together a successful and memorable end-of-summer evening. The banquet menu choices reflects favorites on their dinning room menu. \n\nAt our little, intimate soiree, we started off with their California Hass Avocado and Hearts of Palm salad which was made of organic little gem & mixed lettuces, toasted chopped hazelnuts & a wonderful herb pesto. Thin slivers of shaved summer truffles lay on to of the hearts of palms which some guests mistook for cheese and was pleasantly surprised at the combination of the two. \n\nI selected the following two dishes as our entree choices: \n\n- I had the wild caught California White Sea Bass (not Chilean and fully sustainable!) It was perfectly cooked and sat atop a bed of risotto made with tomatillo water. I particularly enjoyed the side of fried squash blossom Filled with halibut brandade tomato relish with some EVOO and Basil lovingly drizzled on top \n\n- The client next to me had the other choice of wood-roasted California angus filet mignon topped with french beans, bacon and cipollinis with a warm vinaigrette. The sides looked like a chunky bit sunshine - yellow and white Corn and fingerling yukon gold potatoes.\n\nThey were generous enough to allow another two choices for dessert: \n- Half of our table opted for devilish chocolate brownie sundae with hot fudge, vanilla bean ice cream and chantilly cream. \n\n- Not to be outdone, the angel food cake proved to be just as rich as a brownie. (Pamela warned me that the angel food cake is dipped in butter and brown sugar - that sort of sealed the deal with me) it came with a rich mascarpone ice cream, blackberries and peach sorbet.

What has thawed my heart slightly and calmed my anger? Boulevard. \n\nA group of 6 of us came in one Sunday evening to share some dishes and a couple bottles of wine. For appetizers, we ordered the soft shell crab, pan seared scallops, and ahi tuna. All items were good but not great. Except for the scallops - I freaking loved those little things. As for the main dishes, we ordered the lamb, pork, and one fish dish. The lamb wasn't tender enough, which makes the entire dish unappealing. The pork was dry...really dry. The fish - I can't even tell you which fish dish we ordered because it was that unmemorable. \n\nAs you can see, Boulevard, in fact, is really not that amazing and is very much over-hyped (my personal opinion). However, I really must admit that they do have one dish that they have truly perfected. Boulevard's scallops are hands down the best scallops I have ever had. Given that I am a seafood fanatic and order scallops whenever they are on the menu, you can count on me for this one. I will even pay for your scallops if you don't like them - that's how much I mean it.\n\nAs happy as can be with the scallops, though, there was one quite important aspect of my dining experience that I really couldn't shake. Our waitress was so great in helping us choose our dishes, but everything else about her was just so...annoying, rude, and a number of other negative adjectives. Not only did she hover a whole lot, but she also thinks it's appropriate to tell us how much we owed her for her services. When the check had returned back to us after our cards had gone through, we realized we hadn't tipped her enough. While we were all reaching for our wallets to put in extra money, the hovering waitress had remained hovering without us noticing until she so rudely quipped, \"No, you didn't tip enough. I tried to give you a great experience, but I guess I did not do well enough.\" AWKWARD. She is lucky my friends are far nicer and more polite than I am as I would have totally walked out without putting another dollar on the table for her. \n\nSO - \nPros: scallops, ambiance (sophisticated but not snooty), free corkage on second bottle, which was awesome as I happened to have some wine in my car.\nCons: Waitress, over hyped food (not really their fault, I guess)\n\n3.5. \nYes, I fucking hate bad customer service.", "author": "Ha V."}

So crowded that people who had reservations and were waiting to be seated were getting hit in the back and shoulders by the revolving doors each time new people walked in. \n\nLove the interior design; tons of old school character. I ordered lobster bisque and then some sort of chicken dish. Everything was excellent. I'd order it again, and take people there I want to impress. Willie Brown was sitting at the table next to us. \n\nThe only thing I disliked about the experience was that at our table of six, the waiter kept reaching in front and across me to serve the person to my left, instead of going around my back (there was space).

Good bread and good wine by the glass. But the food? is oversalted. I had salmon on a bed of corn and wild rice, with a spinach salad.  My other half had steak.  All of the dishes were prepared very well, and the ingredients were great, but the saltiness of the food gets in the way of fully appreciating it.  Even without the salt, for the prices Boulevard charges I expect a certain zip to the food, some alchemy of flavor, and -- though the menu is interesting and the cooking is skillful -- that extra magic just isn't there.  I don't think we'll be back.", "author": "Julia S."}

It has always been one of our dreams to eat at a Michelin rated restaurant. Instead of going to a play like we originally planned, we decided on a fancy restaurant.\n\nAfter flipping through the SF Michelin guide (deciding we could only afford one star) and talking to one of my dad's best friends, we decided on Boulevard. \n\nThe decor is beautiful and classy. I felt like I was in a lovely French brasserie. You cannot beat the view from the dining room of the Bay Bridge and the Ferry Building. The view is particularly beautiful at twilight, when we were there, due to the lights on the bridge being turned on. I had reservations, which is obviously the way to go. When we arrived, we half expected not to be taken seriously due to our age (we are both eighteen) but were treated absolutely wonderfully. The wait staff was more than attentive and helpful. Although, one patron in her fifties did give me a confused/bitchy look in the bathroom. But my friend did try to assure me it was just because of my age (we were certainly the youngest by at least seven years).\n\nI had the squab and quail with wild rice and seared foie gras. It quite seriously was one of the best meals of my life. My best friend had the white sea bass with a squash blossom fritter stuffed with Dungeness crab. For dessert, he had the raspberry-lemonade sorbet and I the Mascarpone cheese ice cream. Loved it.\n\nSince we were unable to order drinks (although I have heard their Cucumber Gimlet is fantastic), our bill came to $97 without the tip. He thought it would amount to more, so we were both happy. \n\nI love this place and I will go back again as soon as I can find a fellow foodie from the city to accompany me and make some more money.", "author": "Emily M."}

I hope they keep it, because it was delicious and flavorful. I had the rabbit ravioli for an entree. The portion was small - perfect for lunch with an appetizer, but if you are coming for dinner or only ordering an entree, this might be too light.

This place far exceeded my expectations.  It's really all in the details and from the decor, architecture, furniture, food, menu and service everything was top notch.

The blue colored water glasses, the revolving doors, leather menus, brick ceiling, tiled floor, wall decor, table settings and lighting just made the experience great. For our meal we had the pork chop and sea bass and both had such amazing flavors you want to savor every bite. We also had the butterscotch pudding for dessert and that was amazing.

First off the process is arduous and unnecessarily complicated. You have to call to the day, 6 weeks before your planned date at 1:00P exactly. The reservation team specifically- Becca, is rude, curt and incredibly unprofessional. After trying to book the room over 3 months checking in by email, I called at 1:05P and was told \"sorry, the reservation had been taken. That's why we asked that you call at 1P.\" Did I mention that I drove in the day earlier and sent repeat emails trying to secure this reservation? No semblance of understanding was given by this woman. In response to asking if our group could be seated in the main dining room, her response, \" I don't think we can accommodate a group your size (8), I'll have to ask our GM.\" When asked when she might expect a response? She replied, \"when he gets back to me.\" Really? Wow!! So rude. In desperation I accepted the only available 9:15P booking and was told I would receive a confirmation email. None was ever sent, even after a follow up email. 2 days later I cancelled the reservation and sent the reservation staff an email of dissatisfaction. Crickets... I see why this establishment has lost it's Mitchelin star. The dining experience is so much more than a good meal. For the amount you pay to eat at Boulevard you should rightfully expect a modicum of respect and a good customer experience.  Need a private room for a special occasion? I highly recommend Aquerello.

With those credentials we had to check it out. My friend and I stopped in for lunch around 12:30 on a Thursday and the place was full with lots of tables with people on power lunches and lots of tables with people drinking wine and enjoying a long lunch in the city.\n\nWe were told to sit at the counter, which is essentially a bar giving a great view into the open kitchen. This was a great tip just for the fact that the couple behind us was told they may have a 20 minute wait for a table and we were seated right away (there was only one other fellow at the counter). Our server arrived for drink orders about 30 seconds after we'd been handed menus, so he said he'd be right back to see what we wanted. It was quite awhile before he arrived to ask what we'd like to drink, so by then we had our food orders in mind. I don't mind waiting for food, but don't make me wait for a drink while I also wait for food. We chose a couple drinks off the specialty menu, mine was the saffron gin martini, which was excellent, but it showed up about 2 minutes before my food, with which I would have preferred a glass of wine. \n\nThe guys working this kitchen have the assembly process down. The special of the day was a Kobe burger, and they would have at least 5 plates lined up with fries as they toasted buns, made the burgers to order and put them together with sauce and toppings. We also watched them put together the Day Boat Scallops in the same manor. It was pretty easy to pick out the house favorites. \n\nI had the soft shell crab and my friend ordered the Kobe burger. Both were quite good and cooked perfectly. The burger was huge and flavorful and $16, which is completely reasonable for what we received.

For the main course, I ate the lamb prime rib, cooked medium rare. The only reason I give this less than five stars was that it wasn't quite medium-rare, but more medium.

I wanted to  try  this place for a while.  Got the chance, went here for my anniversary.  My wife ordered the filet and I ordered the lamb.  But, let me back it up.  We ordered one appetizer, two tomato wedges, some arugula and mozzarella.  It was sparse, but tasted ok, not shocking or great, just ok.  I could have made this in 5 minutes after a stop at Safeway.  We ordered a cocktail, nothing unusual or extraordinary at all.  I ordered a $100 bottle of wine.  Wine list wasn't great, had about 18 Bordeaux to chose from, that's not a lot.  We ordered our entr\u00e9es.  The filet, not prime.  It was choice Angus.  Well, that's ok, it was under $50. The filet had no flavor, washed out.  It had been pan seared, but no crust, just bland and totally ordinary.  My lamb..I got three chucks of lamb for $40. These are chunks I may have thrown into a sandwich as leftovers had I been at home.  These chunks should not have had the starring role in any entr\u00e9e.  Tried to skip the dessert but the nice waiter brought us a complimentary scoop of ice cream so at least this screwing had a happy ending.  Completely underwhelmed.  This place did not wow me.  I came home and made some pasta.  For special occasion night out, look at other options.", "author": "Tim K."}

As one would say, this is truly a date place.\n\nI chose to try Boulevard because of the reviews it got from articles that I have read.  It seemed that most say it is one of the best dining places in SF.  So that sparked some curiosity in me.  And I wanted to spoil my friend a little.\n\nIt was a Friday night and we had reservations at 9:15.  First impression, I loved the coziness it gave off.  The mood of the restaurant was dimly lit and intimate.  But there was a good buzz from all the people.  It was very full which is always a good sign.\n\nAfter checking in, the host had told us our table was going to be ready shortly and to enjoy the bar as we wait.  At first I felt somewhat disappointed asking myself what the purpose of having a reservation.  So we went and had a drink at the bar and had a seat at one of the small tables.  And no more than 10 minutes, another hostess came up to us, addressing us by our party name, holding the menus and taking our drinks and putting it on a tray that she had, and asked us to follow her to our table.  At that moment, I took back the negative feeling that I had initially, and appreciated that service of actually being more personal with the guests and making them feel that they are being serviced.\n\nOur server was awesome.  She knew her stuff and was attentive to our needs.  I ordered the T-bone Lamb and she knew that it was not a typical order and I might not know how to properly cut into it and gave me tips on how to get the best experience with eating a bone in tenderloin of lamb.  That was absolutely a treat.  Rack of Lamb is so common, so being able to try the Tenderloin of Lamb bone in was exactly what I was looking for when looking for something out of the box cousine.\n\nMy friend ordered the halibut which she loved!  I got to try some and the combination of the perfectly cooked halibut with the toppings was definitely a treat.\n\nOne of the things that noticed... the location of the restrooms.  This might sound weird, but the restrooms was through a door marked by a curtain and you have to go downstairs where it is located.  I don't know if its the design of the building, or done on purpose, but I love how its not part of the restaurant.  Gave a sense of class in my opinion.\n\nDefinitely worth giving a try once and its a nice treat on special occasions.", "author": "Japen G."}

The Service, I had to call back to confirm my reservation and was kept holding the line for an unacceptably long time, then spoken to like I was interrupting something important, that pissed me off. On the night we were greeted and seated. Our waiter was OK, but watching the action on the floor I could see other waiters that were far more pleasant and entertaining, he wasn't rude and he knew his stuff, he just seemed a little boring compared to the other animated characters.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-11", "description": "After seven consecutive years of nominations. Congratulations to Chef/Owner Nancy Oakes and Pat Kuleto on their recent 2012 James Beard award. Often dubbed the \"OSCARS\" of the Culinary industry.  Established in 1990, the James Beard Foundation Awards recognize culinary professionals for excellence and achievement in their fields and continue to emphasize the Foundation's mission: to celebrate, preserve, and nurture America's culinary heritage and diversity. \n\nBOULEVARD is nestled in the historic Audiffred Building.  In the Embarcadero Waterfront with views of the Bay Bridge, The historical building that is home to BOULEVARD is the only local structure to have survived the 1906 earthquake and the fire that destroyed major portions of San Francisco.  The building was to finally suffer from a fire in 1978 that destroyed the interior completely, but that left the brick and stone facade intact.  On May 10, 1981 was designated Landmark No. 7 of the City of San Francisco. The exterior of the building, with the exception of the atrium style top floor that was added, is identical to what would have been seen by passersby in 1889.  As you enter BOULEVARD via revolving doors it is not difficult to imagine the interior being a part of that bygone era, with beautifully crafted wood, fixtures, iron and mosaic work that graces each element of the detailed design. A fitting home for what has become one of San Francisco's landmark restaurants. Reason for mentioning the history of the Audiffred building is because the bathroom is quite far away depending on where your seated which is due to the fact that the Audiffred Building is a San Francisco historical landmark and to relocate the restrooms would be quite the arduous task. \n\nAfter quick valet and prompt seating I had a chance to just enjoy the ambiance of BOULEVARD. Very bustling downtown San Francisco business vibe. Businessman checking their stocks on their phones or talking with their colleagues about the next proposed deal was nothing but typical Downtown San Francisco. The age range I noticed was mid 30's to upper 50's. \n\nStarter: Local Calamari. (Stuffed with 'Nduja & Shrimp Panzanella Calabrian Chili Aioli, Artichoke Hearts, Pickled Kale & Crispy Calamari). Very tasty but not your usual Calamari you would find in bulk. Each Calamari were individually wrapped and stuffed while giving you the more traditional option of a crispy Calamari.  Artichoke Hearts with the Calabrian Chili Aioli were incredible paired with Calamari.\n\nSalad: Bruno Del Rosso Tomato & Burrata Salad ( Star Route Organic Lettuces with Fines Herbes, Lemon, Anchovy, Caper & Chili Flake Relish, Toasted Levain Croutons & Taggiasca Olives). Very Nice Salad. \n\nMain: Berkshire (Kurobuta) Pork Prime Rib Chop.  Wood Oven Roasted Crispy Bacon & Sauerkraut Dumplings, Cider Glazed Turnips, Apple Creme Fraiche\nSauteed Red & Green Spinach, Caraway & Apple Balsamic Vinaigrette Roasted Pork Jus with Sage. lol.... WOW this dish was amazing. From the tender pork to the perfect compliments of bacon & Sauerkraut Dumplings this dish was out of this world. One of the best Pork Chops I've ever had without a doubt. The sauteed Red & Green Spinach were just right on and complimented the dumplings well. \n\nWhile others in my party opted for more of a chocolate dessert I decided to go with the more subtle approach. A scoop of strawberry ice cream with a simple oatmeal cookie. Strawberry Ice Cream was heavenly and the Oatmeal Cookie was once again \"the perfect compliment\". I can not remember the exact ingredients to the drinks I had but I can tell you what they were. If you want a mans man drink. Seriously a grown man strong drink then order \"The Boulevardier\" which  consists of bourbon and other tasty ingredients. I had to scale it back a bit so I went with the \"Jack Rose\" which consists of Apple Brandy, Grenadine, Simple Syrup, and other ingredients. Very strong and beautifully constructed cocktails. Well worth the money you are paying. \n\nIn conclusion BOULEVARD restaurant truly deserves the James Beard Award, for I'm surprised BOULEVARD has not won the award previously. Being that a restaurant can only win the award once, BOULEVARD joins The French Laundry in Yountville as James Beard Award winners. BOULEVARD exemplifies outstanding service. With attentive and knowledgeable waitstaff, top notch bartenders, and delicious food you can not go wrong dining at BOULEVARD.\n\nF.Y.I. - All chocolate is made from scratch in house, as well as the Grenadine for their liquors which is made from fresh Pomegranate.", "author": "Alastair G."}

I have been coming to Boulevard since the late 90's and have always had great meals there and have met some really interesting people as well. \n\nIt was a Saturday night, May 31, 2014 and we had a reservation for 7:45pm. When we checked in at the front desk the hostess told us to have a seat at the bar and that they would be coming to get us shortly. After 45 minutes passed I went over to the front desk and asked why we were still waiting at the bar for a 7:45pm reservation at 8:30pm? The front desk hostess looked at our reservation and realized that the previous hostess had not checked us in. Big no no in the restaurant business like missing a wake-up call at a hotel. We then waited another 5 minutes and were seated.\n\nEthan was our waiter and he is a Boulevard historian and great waiter and I have been served by him various times over the nearly 15+ years that I have been coming to this restaurant. Within our party we all ordered the fish dishes and three of us thought the meals which came about 45 minutes later to the table were lukewarm and just OK. The other person in our party was just enamored by the overall experience of Boulevard and thought his salmon dish was prepared to perfection. I have had several friends from New York, Chicago and other major dining cities tell me that they did not know what all the fuss was about and thought the restaurant was good but not exceptional. I can tell you that after coming here for 15+ years my last few visits to Boulevard makes me start to see the decline that I experienced years ago at One Market Street restaurant. Taking your loyal customers for granted and losing your edge of what it takes to stay on top of the restaurant scene in a City like San Francisco. We should have been offered a free dessert or had a meal written off the bill for the various inconveniences we experienced throughout the evening. But that is not how restaurants operate when the economy is good within the City...they do not have to according to their assessment.\n\nWe all understand that the City has changed and Boulevard is a dinosaur from a business model perspective due to the changing dynamics and increased hipsters into the City but that is why you opened up Prospect right to cater to the new technology elite that have no taste they just want to be seen and fed mediocre food in a more hip environment for higher prices. \n\nI am sorry Boulevard but this Saturday night you missed on several fronts.", "author": "Reynold B."}

As such I had very high expectations of what a Michelin star rated restaurant is. I ended up going here with my girlfriend for lunch instead of dinner.\nThat may have been my mistake. Lunch was less than stellar and also may be due to the fact that my fianc\u00e9e and I both got the burgers. We are huge fans of burgers and I base the quality of the food at the restaurant based on their burgers. Generally burgers are usually the best sellers at restaurants if available so believe this is a fair assessment to make. \nAnd just as I thought, most of the dishes being served were the burgers. \n\nThe burger itself wasn't bad but definitely is not memorable. it did not have much flavor and was very simple. I like simplicity in dishes but it must be packed with flavor. However, this burger was not. Maybe it's my fault for getting the burger but as popular as it is, it should be good as any other dish on the menu. Perhaps dinner will be better. \nThe service was great, attentive, without being intrusive. And their drinks are great. I had the Moscow mule and it was delicious, served in a copper mug of course. \nI'd like to come back to try out their dinner menu to get a better assessment of this restaurant. \n\nThe takeaway is, if you're getting lunch at the boulevard, don't get the burger but try some of their other dishes.", "author": "Barnabas H."}

With high per-plate prices and a michelin star come great expectations, and as much as I wanted Boulevard to meet them, they just didn't - at least in the food department.  Everything else? Fantastic.\n\nThe staff is above and beyond awesome.  Everyone was friendly, helpful, prompt, professional, and courteous - they were truly the highlight of the experience.\n\nThe interior was beautiful, with warm brick, inset lighting, and stained glass over the bar.  It was packed with people, but there wasn't really any issue with volume or atmosphere (except for the insanely loud guy behind me, but that's not the restaurant's fault!).\n\nThe food was good.  It tasted okay-to-pretty-good, depending on the dish, was beautifully plated, and served at an appropriate time.  Everything was well-cooked.  (To preface this next bit, I'm NOT a picky eater at all, and I was really looking forward to trying a michelin star restaurant.)\n\nMy real disappointment was with the duck wrapped in pancetta, served over a bed of wild rice with roasted cherries.  (There were spinach and onions involved as well.)  It sounded SO GOOD on the menu, but in reality, there wasn't a lot of flavor.  It could have been a matter of using a sauce with more punch (or more of what existed), but when I was done with the dish I was thinking of ways it could have been improved, not sitting back and thinking \"yum, that's orgasmic.\"   \n\nIn comparison, I had some of my boyfriend's hawaiian walu with lobster-stuffed calamari - that was MUCH better.  He even liked the fried cauliflower they served, which is quite an accomplishment for him.   (He did NOT like my duck dish.)\n\nDessert was good - we had the chocolate cherry marquis.\n\nSo, maybe Nancy Oakes' vision doesn't jibe with mine, maybe that dish was just a fluke, or maybe my expectations were too high.  Totally possible.  But when you're charging $30-40/plate, I think you should be wowed.  I loved the location, the staff, and the experience of trying Boulevard, but I don't know that I'd go out of my way to try it again.", "author": "Jennie K."}

I was expecting great food, they do have a Michelin star after all!  This restaurant is supposed to be in the same class as Gary Danko and La Folie and it was not even close.  \n\nIt started with us arriving, 3 of us with coats, and no one asking if they could check them for us.  Then we had an 8 p.m. reservation, and had to wait 15 minutes to be seated.  Then we had to send the first round of martinis back because they tasted like water and had several large pieces of ice floating around in them. \n\nI started with the soft shell crab as an appetizer, thinking it would be pan fried, but it arrived battered and deep fried, so much so, that I couldn't even taste the crab.  My mother had the same thing.  My father tried the ravioli with morels which was good, but nothing too outstanding.  My aunt had the roasted beet salad, which she claimed was good, but I didn't try, so I cannot comment.\n\nFor dinner I had the sole with lobster fritters. The sole was alright, but a tad bit overcooked, and one side was fried.  It was an unusual flavor combination and I was not impressed.  My father had the lamb T-bone, which I tried, and it was delicious.  It did not, however, make up for the overwhelming lousy food that everyone else was served.  \n\nBottom line, if I'm even back in San Francisco, I will NOT be returning to Boulevard.", "author": "Courtney S."}

As far as I can remember being into fine dining, they've been able to manage a consistently high bar of diverse food. Admittedly it's been a while since I've been back and I now question myself why that is. Every time I've been has been highly enjoyable. Any of the steaks (which are menu regulars), the rib eye or filet mignon is always superbly cooked, and when available the duck breast wrapped in bacon is also wonderful. Service is always solid and the ambiance makes for great leisurely meals. The caveats? If you want to eat on a Fri or Sat night you'd best be making reservations at least a week ahead of time (still true in the bad econmony). Even if you have reservations, you might still have to wait.

When I go to a $$$$ establishment I expect hand cut fries or at least good ones. They were frozen and out of a bag I can assure you. \n- Fries were also cold, not as big of a deal.\n- When I told the waiter the fries weren't the best and clearly out of bag.

Then the bill came, and a bunch of factors sort of aligned and I realized that I wasn't having enough fun for the money.\n\nEveryone got one single drink, one salad, one entree, and one scoop of their homemade ice cream.  $290+ for three people including 20% tip.\n\nThat's when my focus shifted: the night before I had eaten at Jon's Street Eats with my husband.  Three courses for 2 people and that was $22 including 20% tip. YES I KNOW IT's not the same thing.  Just please bear with me: yes Boulevard's decor is sublime, the lighting, the nouveau decor, the ambience is incredible.  It's just a gorgeous space.  And like a previous reviewer states - sometimes when you're with a parent you'd pay any price to take them somewhere they can't complain about for 2 hours (i.e. the \"nice\" versus \"fancy\" thing). \n\nBut I felt great value for money at the street cart (see my review).  Was I getting $290 worth of experience at Boulevard?  \n\nAfter the check, my feelings about the experience started to unravel.  I mean, that's a **car payment**!  I'm doing halfway OK in this recession but I'm so much more aware of my money now.  \n\nHere's what when through my mind as we paid the bill: \n\n1. Was the pork ribeye **that** good?\n\n2. Is a beet salad worth $16?  Why are they pairing beets with bleu cheese?  Does that taste right?  Didn't I have a salad at Dopo the other evening that was better?  \n\n3.  Could I make mashed potatoes as good as that?  Are whipped potatoes a new thing that everyone's doing now?  Is there something about these whipped potatoes that sets them apart from say, the food court at Whole Foods?\n\n4. Why is my husband's filet dry?  How do you dry out a filet??\n\n5.  I can't buy that shirt I wanted anymore.  \n\n6. If you balance a filet on three fingerling potatoes, is it now worth 42 dollars?  \n\n7. Why is his broccoli rabe so salty?  \n\n8.  Can't I just buy all these ingredients and make them pretty well myself??\n\n9.  Haven't I had a better homemade ice cream at Bi-Rite Creamery or Lush?  \n\n10.  Where is my waitress? \n\n11.  I wanted those new curtains this month but now I guess I can wait until next month.    I wonder if they'll sell out by the time I can afford them...\n\n\n\n\nA few months ago, I dropped the same amount of money per-person at The Bazaar in Los Angeles - maybe a little more.  Unlike here, I walked away feeling like I just got away with stealing something - food was so bright and interesting and weird and magnificently tasty and balanced.  I drank 2 glasses of the most salacious wine ever.  I ate almost every tapa on the menu. The servers were incredible.  I got tipsy and started texting and MMSing pictures of each course.  I'm still talking about that place. \n\nThe point:  I felt like Bazaar was a wonderful way to hemorrhage some of my hard earned money and I would do it again with no problem.  I would give up things to go back to The Bazaar. I did not feel the same about Boulevard.\n\nSo have a drink at their beautiful bar and maybe get some food, take the out-of-town family there for a very special occasion.

What should distinguish the best from the average is the service, and my last experience at Boulevard fell far short of my expectations.\n\nIt was the night of our 5-year wedding anniversary. We started out with a crab appetizer - good. My husband had the filet mignon - again, good. I had the squab and quail duo - great. What was missing was a knowledgeable server who knew wines and cheeses (since we got the cheese course instead of a dessert). I asked about the different French wines by the glass - varietals I had not heard of and wanted a good recommendation but our server clearly did not know about the wines nor tasted them. So I pretty much got a textbook description of a few which frankly did not help so I ended up with the Patricia Green Pinot which I was told was a light Pinot which it was not. \n\nThen for the cheese course, I asked what the difference was between the two goat cheeses listed. Again, the server seemed unsure which made me unsure of what I was going to get. She recommended the Italian goat cheese because it's \"creamier\" - aren't all goat cheeses creamy by definition? I was not happy with the recommendation. I would have appreciated the server telling me that this one was a strong, pungent goat cheese in which case I may not have ordered it.

Nothing extraordinary about it, but delicious because ahi tuna tartare is always yummy unless the fish isn't fresh.\n\nCrab Salad - Huge disappointment.  Looked and tasted like a glorified tuna salad.  Actually, it tasted worse than the tuna salads that I make for my sloppy Tuesday lunch.  Tasteless and bland.  Skip it!\n\nScallops - The scallops were definitely out of this world.  Cooked to perfection, melt in your mouth goodness!  Sadly, someone thought it was a good idea to include these disgusting tunips/radishes with them.  Bad idea!  I had to rinse my mouth out with wine to get rid of that turnipy taste to enjoy the other scallops!\n\nFoie Gras - My friend loved it.  I didn't enjoy it that much, but I admit my bias:  I'm not a foie gras fan.  Never quite developed the taste for it.\n\nThe gnocchi and cheese ravioli were towards the end, so I was stuffed and couldn't really enjoy eating as much.  All I remember is the ravioli wasn't as good as the gnocchi.\n\nOverall, I thought the ingredients were fresh and delicious, but some food combinations were not well thought out.

It was just my luck that I ordered an appetizer and main entree with very similar sauces.  I thought this was my mistake so I was pretty conscious to avoid making the same mistake when I went to Gary Danko. However, the waitress at Gary Danko assured me that the variety of flavors in their dishes would avoid any overlap. Gary Danko +1, Boulevard 0.  You'd think that the chefs at Boulevard would realize the overlap and recommend another  dish but they didn't. Strike 1.\n\nNow, not only were my appetizer and entree similar, but the flavor of the sauce and the texture of the quail was something that didn't dazzle my tastebuds.  The sauce was all to familiar and perhaps I even had a similar dish at a less expensive restaurant.  What a disappointment. Strike 2. \n\nThe service was okay, nothing spectacular.  The waitress came by once to see if the food was okay then never returned.  She also seemed in a rush and preoccupied.   When our dishes arrived at Boulevard, no one took the time to explain our food.  For a restaurant rated for high customer service, I would expect quality service regardless of how busy the night is.  The reason why I have this expectation is because Gary Danko was just as packed the service was impeccable.  (Gary Danko +2, Boulevard 0).\n\nAlso in regards to the seating, if you're lucky enough to snag a seat at the 6 or so tables at far end of the restaurant, you'll get a spectacular view of the Bay Bridge.  However if you're no where near there, the seating is okay. \n\nWhen we arrived early to our reservation at Boulevard, we simply stood in front of the revolving door entrance.  It was a bit awkward but we were seated maybe 10 minutes later.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-09-28", "description": "I finally decided to stop into Boulevard for dinner. I wanted to preface my review by noting that I only had the appetizers and dessert. I wasn't very hungry, but I wanted to treat myself tonight to a nice small dinner that would fill me up without overdoing it. And I have been thinking about Boulevard lately, since it was so close to the office. I walked in, and the room was this beautiful Art Nouveau/Belle Epoque design: the fantastic bricked ceilings gave the room a very old, but beatiful feel. The light fixtures throughout were very serenely classic, giving the whole atmosphere a very elegant feel. I was very impressed. The waitstaff couldn't be more helpful and up to par with the best restaurants in the City-my waiter was friendly enough. \n\nNow comes the important part: the food. As I mentioned earlier: I only had two appetizers: I ordered the Moterey Red Abalone with Spanish Octopus: that arrived in a small boat-shaped bowl. For $22.00, I could not believe what I got: a very petite piece of octopus, which was a little unrecognizable, a few small shell beans, and I think abalone, but I wasn't sure. The problem here is that the restaurant had the nerve to charge me $22.00 for such a puny little portion. I know this is considered a high end restaurant, and I suppose one expects such small portions, but for $22.00??? Really? Then I went on to my ravioli appetizer: it was supposed to be a porcini butter confit rabbit-I got THREE SMALL raviolis-SMALL! I mean I have never ever had three small small small puny raviolis for $16.00. $16.00!!!! For THREE SMALL RAVIOLIS. And then the description said that it came with wild greens. What? Was it some sort of a mirage-themed appetizer where you have three little pieces of greens in the midst of three tiny little raviolis? And the mushrooms looked like tiny little...well...nevermind. I could barely even pick them up with my fork they were so small. And I am a mushroom fanatic! I almost asked the very nice waiter for a magnifying glass! I had the entire side of bread to try and compensate for the lack of food on my table. I would have been hungry at the end of my meal (not to mention sick at the thought of spending $38.00 for those two plates) had I not had three Amaretto Sours. I am willing to pay the price for a good meal, but come on people! Really! However, all is not lost:  the saving grace came at the end: the Chocolate Marshmallow Pie. THAT was worth the having to sit through those Barbie-doll sized appetizers. The Milk Chocolate Mouse sitting on top of the Chocolate Streusel Crust,topped sooooo beautifully with the mouth-seducing burnt marshmallow, and the two delicious chocolate chip cookies with the chocolate ice cream in the middle was the perfect way to finish my day. I basically forgot about the meal before that (until I sat down tonight to write this review). It is worth it to just go back ONLY for this dessert, and I haven't had a dessert that good since the Ile Flottant at this restaurant in Paris! I may even try the other dessert offerings at Boulevard, visiting only for those desserts. The Pastry Chef is a Goddess. I would kneel before her if I could.", "author": "Julien N."}

It was also conveniently located 400 yards from our hotel.\n\nIt was Monday night and the place was packed, and apparent it wasn't going to slow down. As I always do before going to a new place, I perused the online menu beforehand and already determined I was going to have the duck, wild rice with spring fennel, sauteed red & green spinach, roasted yellow chanterelle mushrooms, melted celery root, pine nuts & rainbow carrot confit. Probably the best duck I have ever had - cooked to perfection and the plating was simply divine. Oh, and you'd be foolish to skip dessert.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-12", "description": "I should start this review with the fact that were it not for the pastry chef this place would be receiving 3 stars, and that compared to some of the other high class, business lunch places I ate at in San Francisco they have a long way to go to catch up. What they lack in the food service department they fortunately make up for in a refined, elegant dining space, with some quaint hints of a more rustic San Francisco era, especially at the bars. If you sit towards the back of the restaurant you can also get a nice elevated view, above everyone else, of the Bay Bridge.\n\nMaybe it was the fact that I came in alone, or that I was carrying a camera bag, or that I was wearing a cable-knit fisherman's sweater and not a suit, but for some reason I was ignored pretty heavily here by my server, who seemed to have very little interest in catering to me at all, despite how empty the restaurant was at the time. I had to stop another waiter server several times, to ask for water refills and some bread, which honestly wasn't that good anyway, although it looked great. Perhaps that is part of the reason I was a little more harsh on the food critique than I would have been otherwise, but whatever the case I expect good service, especially in this city.\n\nI will give them credit for having a substantially diverse menu, and I wanted to try just about everything on it, so narrowing down to a reasonable selection for lunch was pretty difficult. In the end I decided to start with the spicy ahi tuna tartar with cucumber-miso vinaigrette, cilantro, and wasabi potato chips. The flavor combination was good, and you could tell the quality of the fish was top notch, but I really wanted more from the wasabi chips. I was expecting a nice, bold kick from them, but instead they were kind of flat, and not all that crunchy either. I think if they had been a little more powerful and the sauce holding the tartar had been a bit stronger this dish would have been excellent.\n\nHaving a bit of lamb envy from Nicole's dish at Fleur De Lys the previous night, I decided to go for the lamb loin medallions with yukon gold mashed potatoes, creamed wild nettles, chanterelle mushrooms, and lamb jus. Much like its predecessor, this dish lacked flavor in several areas I expected to find it. The nettles had virtually no flavor, and served little purpose in the dish other than color, and the potatoes were just bland, no hint of garlic, pepper, or even salt. The mushrooms were a nice companion to the lamb, which was thankfully cooked wonderfully, and really saved this dish.\n\nI was so bummed by the first two courses that I had pretty much written off any chance of trying dessert, and was ready to pack my stuff up and head out to Dolores Park to take some photos of hippies. By stroke of pure luck, I happened to glance at the dessert menu anyway, saw something that really intrigued me, and wound up having what turned out to be my favorite dessert of the entire trip. The gingersnap ice cream sandwiches with pumpkin spice ice cream, Mexican chocolate sauce, and Chantilly cream I'm assuming are a seasonal dessert, so hopefully you get the opportunity to try this before they swap it out for something. Although, considering how expertly crafted this dessert was, I have the utmost confidence that Boulevard's pastry chef will deliver another knockout in its place. The flavors that were so desperately wanting in the first two courses were very much abundant in this final one, and at the end you wish you had another 2 cookies (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA&select=5crpl87eKBN0Q9ZnVD_tdA) on the way.

We decided to wrangle our close friends and do a group dinner of 10 people there.  We made a reservation about 1.5 months ahead, and they booked the wine vault room for us.  The room itself is pretty cool - it's separate from the rest of the restaurant and it houses all the wine.  The one weird thing about that room is because it houses all the wine, the waiters come in every few minutes to retrieve bottles of wine, so it definitely gets distracting.  I got the crispy abalone & hamachi tartare appetizer - the abalone was good but the hamachi tartare was just okay.  The tartare wasn't super flavorful and nothing special.  For my entree, I got the quail.  It was very rich, but super good.  The quail itself was cooked really well and was really moist.  It also comes with pancetta wrapped quail leg - this was good but pretty fatty.  My friend couldn't finish her portion since it was so rich.  My husband got the kurobuta pork chop.  This was amazingly good.  Another friend of mine got the sole, and found the pasta part of it very salty.  For dessert, I got one cherry fudge bon bon.  Definitely very small for the price, but it was good.  My friend got the meyer lemon icebox cake.  The strawberry sorbet was REALLY good - great flavor and not too sweet.

On my quest to complete the 2010 Michelin list of dining experiences, I made a reservation at Boulevard last night. Everything sounded wonderful and would have been if.... \n\nMy first course, the foie gras was beautifully present but was cold in the middle and bloody! I have never had to send a dish back, this was a first for me. At $27 it really did need to be cooked properly. My dining partner continued with his abalone first course which he said was good, but not accurately described as it has a dairy based sauce (he is lactose intolerant) but was not described this way on the menu. When the foie finally returned they had simply reheated it instead of replacing it! I was very surprised that a restaurant of this caliber would do that. At the end of the meal they did remove it from the bill but I would have preferred a properly prepared foie in the first place. \n\nSecond course for my friend was the pork ribeye/cheek and the lamb chop T-Bone for me (as recommended by the server as the best dish they had to offer). Once again they both were presented beautifully if they had been properly prepared. Both were over salted and uncomfortable to eat. The interior of both of the meat dishes was somewhat better and cooked well but could not overcome the saltiness overall. We decided to skip dessert based on the first 2 courses. \n\nCharming and warm decor that was drowned out by the noise level.

Creme Fraiche was fun to swirl around. You can really taste the lobster and the portion was just right for a soup appetizer. Good consistency and good flavor. Lobster was not too over powering.\n\n- tuna tartare - nothing to really rave about. Good but not exceptional.\n\n- seared sea scallops w/ squid - super yummy. I liked this dish better than the soup and tuna tartare. The scallops were seared perfectly.\n\n\nEntree:\n\n- house made pasta (fettucine) w/ mediterranean (sp?) flavored shrimp & mussels - i have no idea why i ordered pasta but it was just one of those days where carbs just looked the most comforting for my stomach. I should have ordered the Kobe Bavette because looking over at my colleague's dish i almost drooled.  Anyways my dish was good, not spectacular. It was odd not to have mussels with the shell in my pasta. Maybe cause my plate was really small? Portions are on the smaller side but that's a good thing because it's lunch!\n\n\nDessert:\n\n- chocolate macaron with dallop of pistachio ice cream on top a fudgy brownie/cake. Really good but too big for one person. \n\n- coffee creme brulee - decent\n\nCocktail:\n\n- cucumber gimlet - more on the tart side but not overly sweet and you can really taste the cucumber. Luckily it was not really strong so it was still ok for lunch :)\n\nService: \n\n- not bad but they did not re-fold my napkin when i left to use the ladies room.  Other than that everyone was really nice. It wasn't quick but wasn't really slow either. \n\nI would definitely want to come back for dinner.", "author": "Terry D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-09-08", "description": "My husband and I were given a gift card of $200 to spend at the Boulevard--our first time.  The first thing I noticed on entering was how many white shirts+black tie and/or vest are working there, moving about in seemingly huge numbers, giving it a very busy, darkly lit, dressed-up banquet but near-taverny type-of-atmosphere.  It felt like a lot of fun to be here.  Thankfully the carpet helped to dim the noise.  \n     The waiter was very cordial, always looking after us.  At times, near the dinner end, I thought he was putting an oddly-timed self-interest first to butt-into our intense conversation to ask how the dinner was going.  Ok that was forgiven, but not for half the food we selected. \n   We ordered 2 Starters: Dungeness Crab salad and the Calamari.   The crab salad had 3 slivers of crab about 2.5 inches long x 1 inch wide and 1/3 to 1/2 inch thick, laid naked atop 3 thick pieces of avocado, with a melon dressing and sprigs of greens here and there.  I have seen more crab meat in 1 joint of a crab that I had cracked myself at Fisherman's Wharf than I saw in this dish.  What a joke.  For $18, that was the dullest, most unimaginative salad with not enough crab to make up for the lack in ingenuity.  Before ordering, I actually had considered the salad would be sufficient for me without ordering an entree. That much avocado on anyone's plate is an appetite killer and who wants to waste the entire dinner experience on something I can eat at home for 50 cents?  Ha.  \n    The Calamari was rubbery with a flavor nothing to write home about, my husband reports, costing a whopping $17.  I'd say these starters should not have been on the menu.  Someone in the kitchen needs help with salad making.  Even the rich and famous deserve better salads/appetizers.\n    On to the dinner.  I was plenty hungry after the slivers of crab so I ordered the prime Pork Chop with fig dressing and spaetzle dotted with lentils, with cooked spinach for $38.  The last time I spent that much was nearly the cost of our entire dinner in the East Bay.  The chop was done perfectly at slightly pink, the dressing was a nice fruit-sweet balance to the salted seasonings on the chop and spinach.  There were only 4 spaetzle pieces on this nearly empty plate so I immediately asked for more and a side dish of spaetzle was supplied right away.  Ok things were looking up.\n      The Filet was great tasting but paying $48 seems way too excessive.  At these prices, I began to think about the giant payroll of this place.   My husband had asked to replace the mashed potatoes with spaetzle - he also got only a few curls  of spaetzle next to his filet so he asked for more.  What's up with meager amounts of spaezle on a plate that already looks empty (like mine did) save the dot of meat at the center?   The young broccoli stems were impossible to chew so he asked for spinach since mine seemed passable.  He got the side of spaetzle OK; however they charged him another $7 for the additional spaetzle.  Ballsy !! -- given the price of the filet dinner, wouldn't it just be decent to include it?   Is this how the 1% make it to the top?\n    Nothing on the desert menu looked interesting so my husband settled for a tiny scoop of OK Chocolate sorbet....($5.00) in a huge bowl.  I was so fat-satiated from the 6 oz pork chop I couldn't consider another thing.  Wise decision on my part not to eat the avacado before dinner.\n   Next time I will definitely look for somewhere else to eat in SF....the meager value of a $153 meal plus tip and SF taxes topping $200 doesn't ring true for me.  No wine included and one drink.  I don't spend that much on groceries for the week.  Have the rich lost their minds and put up with poor starters and punny spaetzle portions?", "author": "Kate S."}

Though we hadn't been to Boulevard for several years, we didn't hesitate when it came to choosing a restaurant: we both had magical memories of the food and the service at this place, & felt sure we'd all enjoy the experience. Sorry to sound a discordant note in the chorus of praise from recent guests, but we were startled by the evening's events. Our wait person had manners appropriate to an Applebee's . She was obviously both bored and overworked, & rattled off the evening's specials as quickly as possible. We waited a long time before the starters arrived. One of us had something he described as \"2 fried eggs & some polenta,\" described by the server as one of the stars on the menu. The rest of us had heirloom tomatoes with burrata, pretty but totally tasteless---what on an ordinary menu would be called \"caprese\" & contained more basil. Two of us then had lamb, which was acceptable; one had soft-shell crab which he obviously found quite ordinary (leaving half a small portion); another some kind of salmon sushi, and I a broiled calamari, the latter 2 from the starter menu. My calamari was truly awful---strangely seasoned, oddly plated, with a texture somewhere between denim and horsehair. Desserts were sorbets for a couple of us; one cheese (straight out of the fridge). No one offered us coffee; during the meal, we ran out of bread, which was not replenished, and there were long hiatuses between courses which was OK because we had lots to talk about, but they WERE inordinately l-o-n g. \nWe went on Aug.31st. The place was crammed with what appeared to be tourists---lots of shorts, ripped jeans, T-shirts, baseball caps. \nWe concluded that a) Boulevard must be coasting on its reputation; b) its summer crowd must be composed mainly of out-of-towners drawn by said reputation, who know little about food or drink, and c) to be on the safe side, we will henceforth go to Zuni, even if it's not tourist season!", "author": "Helen P."}

The hostess was busy trying to accommodate a couple without reservations and spent several minutes looking at her records, scanning the restaurant and consulting with another employee. The entire time my boyfriend and I stood there waiting without ever being acknowledged. I wasn't hoping to cut the line, but even at most cheap joints you are welcomed and told that you will be attended to soon. When the hostess did finally address us, she did so with zero personality (our server had a similar disposition).\n\nWhen we were seated the hostess asked if we needed anything. I mentioned the I had a headache and would appreciate a glass of water. She said that she would ask our server to bring a glass right away. Well, we waited about 5 minutes for a server to appear and when she did, she was either unaware of my request or had forgotten about it. She asked us if we would like any water while we looked over our menus. I said, \"Yes\" and then waited for another 5 minutes for the water to arrive. (So, I'm not obsessed with water or anything, but I also want to mention that, once we had it, the busboy that was refilling our glasses kept doing so with such speed that water sloshed out onto the table every time. That didn't really bother me, but it did seem sort of haphazard for an upscale restaurant).\n\nNow on to the actual food, we ordered scallops for a starter and the first one was TO DIE FOR! It was so delicious that I was starting to remember why I had so loved Boulevard in the past. Then we moved onto the remaining two...both my boyfriend and I agreed that they were the sandiest scallops we had ever tasted. I don't cook seafood (who am I kidding, I don't cook anything), so I am not sure if a cook has anyway of weeding out a sandy scallop. It doesn't change the fact that the texture made eating the last two totally disappointing.\n\nAs entrees, I ordered the filet mignon and my boyfriend had the lobster with sp\u00e4tzle. I thought that his meal was quite good, but he didn't love it. Neither of us were very impressed with my filet. Also, I asked for a substitution (I prefer mashed potatoes to the fingerling potatoes that the filet was paired with) and it came out with fingerling potatoes instead. \n\nSince we both love sweets, my boyfriend and I ordered two desserts to share. The cinnamon ice cream that came with one of them was excellent. Other than that, both were average. \n\nFinally, when the bill came, we noticed that we had been charged an extra dollar for my boyfriend's entree. Given the $150+ total, we didn't even bother to mention it, but it was just one more small disappointment on an underwhelming dining experience.\n\nOverall, the service was below average and the food was OK. At a neighborhood restaurant I would have given a similar experience two, maybe even three, stars, but a restaurant like Boulevard doesn't get the same level of leniency. If it wants to attract the prices of a restaurant that specializes in fine dining, it needs to perform like one.", "author": "Nata B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-27", "description": "Considering how high-end this restaurant is, it's refreshing that they have a chef's counter where you see the line chefs put together the main courses.  \n\nThe prices are high --- a full course meal for one -- starter, main, dessert, coffee, drink --- ran me about $75 not including tip.  Everything, however, was flawlessly executed.  Portions run a little small but to really appreciate the skills in the kitchen, you really should order a 3 course meal.\n\nI started with the dungeness crab salad which was a deconstructed salad.  All the elements of the salad --- the crab, the lettuce, the melon, the citrus --- were separately placed across a long plate.  The crab salad tasted just a tad salty for my taste but all the elements together did make up an impressive dungeness crab salad which was light and refreshing.\n\nFor my main, my waiter recommended the pork chop, which was brined in cider and topped with a dash of pesto.  The chop was perfectly cooked and tender.  I didn't care for the sides except for the greens though.  If I come again, I'll probably try the salmon.\n\nBefore coming to the restaurant, I had made up my mind on having a cheese plate for dessert.  With an impressive selection of cheeses (mostly goat milk cheeses from Italy, France and California), I was served up a small but incredibly tasty wedge of Riobola goat cheese accompanied by several slices of thin baguette, some champagne grapes to cleanse the palette, a small chunk of wild honey and some warm, roasted almonds.  That cheese plate surpisingly turned out to be the highlight of my meal.  It doesn't take a lot of cheese to satisfy the palette and with the compliments of bread, dates and honey with periodic cleansing of the palette with the grapes.\n\nMy other dessert was a flawless cappucino.  A woman at a table nearby ordered a cup of tea and she was brought an iron Japanese tea pot with beautiful ceramic tea accessories.  It's nice to know that when you are paying $5 for a cup of coffee or a cup of tea, all the trappings of luxury are included with that cup of coffee or tea.\n\nNever missing a beat, every component of my meal was made with quality ingredients and flawlessly executed.  In spite of the high-end food, service is refreshingly down-to-earth and unsnobby.  \n\nI'll admit --- there's nothing startingly original on the menu (fish, lamb, pork and a variety of seafood appetizers) but you can taste the freshness of the ingredients.  Come here for the best experience in farm to table California fresh cooking with unpretentious service a nice romantic atmosphere.  \n\nDefinitely make reservations like I did.  I came 15 minutes early but they seated me right away.  A few people at the chef's counter got a little drunk and started jumping up and down (I could feel the vibrations) and earned dirty looks from the waitstaff --- but normally, it's mostly couples out for a romantic dinner.", "author": "Audrey Y."}

Compared to the tuna tartare I've had at other fine dining restaurants (such as Aqua), Boulevard's lagged slightly behind in portion and taste, but it was still good.  The quail, however, was truly excellent, and I highly recommend it--lots of flavor, very filling, and the thyme on it was a great complement to the dish.  \n\nThe food itself weighs in at between 4 and 4.5 stars, but I'm giving Boulevard a full 5 because we received such excellent service.

We called to make a reservation but were told that there is nothing available, however we could try to stop by and sign up before restaurant opens.  We did just that and where able to get in!  \nAtmosphere - we didn't know what to expect but the whole restaurant's setup, brick sealing, decorations on the walls, view of the Bay Bridge seemed to match well with it's name and reminded us of some european boulevards, so I guess 5 stars for that. \nThe waiter service was ok, just that, ok. The waiter didn't seem to be very professional, motivated or helpful.  Can't give more then 3 stars for the service which we really did not expect for a restaurant in this class. \nFood: Bread wasn't warm but fresh and tasty.  Roasted Beet Salad was very good. \nFor our entrees my husband ordered fillet mignon and I ordered a local petrale sole. \nFillet itself tasted good but was lukewarm.  Sole was over salted and tasted fishy. It came on a bed of what seemed to be corn, completely tasteless.  Both dishes had to go back to the kitchen.  Our waiter apologized and asked what would we like to have instead.  My husband had no problem with fillet, except that it was cold, so he reordered it again.  I ordered quail.  This time our dishes came a lot quicker and Fillet Mignon was at the right temperature, however there was a lot more butter in the dish this time, which you could taste, and the cut of meat itself wasn't tasty at all.  My husband left half of his steak untouched - not so great for a $50 dish.  My quail was very tender and tasty.  Overall for basically 1 good entree out of 4, just can't give it more then 3 stars. \nI'm glad this wasn't a special occasion dinner, since it would be even more disappointing.  There are tons of excellent dining places in SF.  I don't think we are coming back.", "author": "T S."}

I am speaking of the salmon and the beef wellington- which were both highly recommended.  Also, starters EXTREMELY small portions, if sharing, you get one-half a bite to one bite each.  Totally not worth it.  Find a good yelped Little Italy restaurant, and go there.  Probably cost 75% less than we wasted at Boulevard. I could go on, but I'm sure you all get my drift.

It was put on the plate in a clump on which sat a quail's egg.  There were some nicoise olives strewn about as well.  It tasted good, but at around $17 was vastly overpriced considering the portion.  I thought the concept was lacking too.  Why not have a nicoise tapenade?  We then split the filet mignon and halibut.  The steak was excellent and accompanied by some fingerling potatoes with cheese on top.  It was very tasty, but I felt like the concept was lacking for a restaurant of this culinary caliber.  Why not accompany it with a spinach risotto?  Meat and potatoes are just so basic.  The halibut was evenly cooked, but lacked any definitive flavor.  It, and its accompaniments, were forgettable.\n\nenvironment/service: five stars (* * * * *)\nWithout a doubt the best service I have ever received in San Francisco, anywhere.  Attentive but not overbearing.  Knowledgeable without being pretentious.  I started making it a habit to call out the names of poor waiters in my reviews, and I feel it only fair to highlight the good ones as well--ours was Alisha.  Along with her, the rest of the wait staff were extraordinarily attentive.  Empty glasses and plates did not sit on the table for more than 10 seconds before someone came around to check on us or remove them.\n\nvalue: three stars (* * *)\nEven with this being a high-end restaurant, I still found prices to be slightly higher than they should have been.  $17 for perhaps 2oz of sushi-grade ahi tuna is steep, and while expensive steaks are no strangers in this town, $40 for around 6oz just seemed a bit higher than it should have been.

My boyfriend opted for the pork chop which was a recommendation from the waiter. I have never seen him enjoy a meal as much as he did that night. This trip was in October and he still mentions the pork chop from there. I'm not a huge fan of pork but I tried it anyway and I could see why he still rants about it. The waiter was animated and attentive, which is always a plus in my book. All together it was a great experience, and if I ever visit SF again I will ensure Boulevard gets a visit from me.", "author": "Jennifer R."}

I love the ambiance and service as well. Last weekend for the first time we went with the intentions of sitting and eating at the bar. They offered us a spot along the open kitchen where you can watch the cooks work their magic instead of the regular bar. It was great! I would request this spot in the future and highly recommend it if you like to see how hard the cooks work. It's a little more casual than the fine dining tables as well. It was fun to see the cooks make our food, then be served it. I loved the beet salad with buffalo mozzarella. It was so delicious. I also had the quail entree with apricot and it was very good as well. 5 stars!", "author": "Natalie N."}

Less face time with statutes and cases, more face time with fine albeit microscopic food... YES!\n\nI began with the lobster bisque, which while devoid of lobster meat, was potent with lobster flavor. It was red instead of white and thin instead of thick, but a solid starter. I really wanted the ahi tuna tartar, but I didn't want to be the fat summer associate known for ordering the most expensive item on the menu either. My life is full of hard decisions.\n\nNext I had the wild caught and pan seared day boat sea scallops. I may be a drama mama, but I'm not exaggerating when I say these were the most delicious scallops ever. They were incredibly huge, slightly crisp outside, perfectly cooked inside, and in this beautiful sauce--my only gripe was that portion size. How does an entree consist of two scallops?\n\nI was still famished and too lazy to return to work, so I decided to get the Valrhona chocolate truffle cake. It was more mousse than cake, but it satiated my appetite until 3p or so.

Truly disappointing.\n\nLet's start with the appetizers. Gritty sandy scallops?!? And not just one... all of them. Don't care to try that again. And the \"meyer lemon air\" on my dungeness crab salad added nothing except made me think \"Oh... they use foam... must be because the chef is trying to mask some bad creation underneath\". The flavor was nice on the salad, though. \n\nAnd then on to the entree. We both had filet, and both asked for medium rare. What arrived was a disaster and poorly cooked. Not sure how you can destroy a nice piece of meat, but the cook certainly did so last night. My first bite was well done (not even medium). And the whole piece was unevenly cooked. The top of my meat was medium-well while the bottom was raw. Looks like someone left it on the grill and forgot about it for a while. And the flavor? There was none... no seasoning at all. Thank god there were salt and pepper shakers on the table, because this was the first time I've ever had to season my own food at a restaurant of this \"caliber\". One of the sides was a fingerling potato dish cooked in duck fat. It is difficult to imagine, but they actually tasted like what happens when you get french fries as take out and leave them too long in the bag before eating them. Soggy and greasy and a bit cold.\n\nWe were hoping that the dessert would at least partially redeem the evening, but we were once again disappointed. It the third (and thankfully) final stop on our culinary adventure. The butterscotch banana cream pie was interesting in concept, but the phillo pastry shell was too dry and couldn't hold up (both flavorwise and structurally) to the goopy filling inside. The balance of whipped cream was way off too. And then there was the \"White Coffee Cream Eclair with Chocolate Glaze, Vietnamese Coffee Ice Cream, Chocolate Pot de Creme, and Chinese Five Spice Shortbread\". Seme like a lot? Yes, it was. A whole lot of bleh... (In truth however the ice cream was actually the best part of the meal.)\n\nIf were just up to the food, I would rate this a one star experience, but I'll give a little credit for the attentive and friendly staff, nice atmosphere, and great wine line list.\n\nBut when you're spending $300 for two for dinner, wouldn't you expect the food to be outstanding?", "author": "Chris C."}

They are not all over you or bringing you black napkins to match your dress/pants - so if you're looking for a place where you drop your fork and 10 people scramble to pick it up, then Boulevard is probably not the place for you. Pretty much everything we ordered was out of this world delicious, but from a conceptual standpoint certainly not awe-inspiring.\n\nThe decor and atmosphere is on the casual side given the price of the food and drinks, which some will love and others will dislike.

I chose the Maine crab cake sliders.  You get two sliders on a grill toasted homemade buns, topped with little bacon strips, heirloom tomatoes, and a bit of magical tartar sauce.  When I think of sliders, I think mini hamburgers.  Seeing it as a crab cake sandwich was new to me.  The crab cakes were really, crabby, too!  It had a good amount of crab meat.  My mouth was happy, happy, happy!\n\nAs for dessert. Mmmm...I wish I remembered what it was called on the menu, but it was a brioche soaked with berry sauce topped with good creme fresh and fresh berries all around.  There was a dollop of ice cream on the side with some chocolate shavings underneath.  \n\nBoulevard really knows how to serve good, well thought out food.", "author": "Rowena B."}

Without a doubt this is one of the most beautiful restaurants in the City during the holidays. My wife and I have eaten here once or twice a year for the past ten years.\n\nThat said, we're unlikely to return and will simply try new places instead.  The combination of the slow service, minuscule portions, prices ($10+ over similar), dreary offerings and \"unspecialness\" (over-hyped, out-of-towners) make it a has-been in my book.\n\nAs far as the food goes my adult sons were really disappointed by the small sizes and unimaginative preparation. I was particularly disappointed with the fois gras; it was a demi-cut at best, overcooked and the little holiday touches (sugared nuts and pumpkin bar) did nothing but make it look lonely on the plate. It looked comical.\n\nWine selection is average and reasonably priced considering the cost of the entrees.", "author": "Richard G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-09", "description": "We hit Boulevard by chance - Tuesday night in San Francisco without reservations, and a last-minute call confirmed a table for 3. We were seated quickly and graciously in the otherwise packed room, which was dressed up for the holidays with some extra glitter and frills. It's a busy space, visually compressed by the low, barrel vaulted ceilings, but still very attractive.\n\nMy feelings about my meal were mixed. The tuna crudo appetizer was skilfully prepared and attractively presented. Small chunks of grapefruit and mango, paper-thin jalapeno and fennel slices and a grassy EVOO added an interesting mix of flavors; I couldn't help but notice that their presence forced the very slightly-flavored tuna to serve more as a platform than a presence of its own. \n\nMy entree was just the opposite. Wayu - a white-fleshed, buttery Hawaiian fish - was cooked perfectly and nestled among black & gold chanterelles, roasted butternut squash, farro, fregola & black barley with arugula, hearts of palm and violin squash, whatever that is. The flavors were fabulous... one offsetting the other with  contrasting and complimentary notes. (The only less-than perfect note was the less-than inspiring hearts of palm, and it may be that there were just a few too many on the plate.) While the first dish had technique but lacked balance in flavor, the entree had it all. The knifework, cooking and assembly of the entire dish were truly impressive, but never tricky or showy. Everything was done, seemingly, for a reason - strength of flavor of each ingredient determined the size of dice and slice, all to good effect.\n\nIn a sense, that's how I felt about the entire experience at Boulevard. Service was for the most part excellent; helpful and knowledgable without showing off or calling attention to itself. The sommelier was extremely knowledgable yet utterly un-intimidating. The one small hitch we found in the service - twice - was some small lack of coordination in timing. We ordered our meals, and wine from the sommelier - and the meals arrived before he was back with the wine. I admit my appetizer sat for a minute while I waited for him to pour the wine. \n\nI decided to go with a glass of Ramey Chardonnay with my entree, rather than the excellent tinta de toro;  again, my entree arrived before the wine. I would have preferred to have the wine first, of course, but hardly a fatal flaw.\n\nWe split one huckleberry tart three ways, and while the filling and accompanying fluer de sel ice cream were delicious, the crust was - not sure how to put this - highly competent but uninspired. Perhaps the dough lacked a touch of salt, but it just was uninspiring after the care lavished on all the individual ingredients in the preceding dishes.\n\nI'd go back, and probably will.", "author": "Robert D."}

You just wouldn't know it from the menu. Currently there are just three vegetarian starters, 2 salads and a pasta appetizer. All are excellent. \n\nThe entree side of the menu shows no vegetarian options. BUT, everyday they create a vegetarian entree special, and I've been able to enjoy two of them so far. The veggie entree isn't an afterthought, it's a selection from all the different sides off the meat-based entrees, but done beautifully. When I get my special platter with 10+ different items (seriously), I feel like the lucky one at the table. \n\nSome of the items from Friday night's platter: asparagus, fava beans and english peas, braised spinach, cauliflower with mimolette fonduta, herb roasted artichoke heart, brie, *three* different preparations of potatoes, wine-soaked cherries, trumpet mushrooms, Crispy Cippolini Onion Stuffed with Gruyere, and one or two more things. \n\nFor the vegetarians that have complained that this isn't the place for them... I'm not sure if things have changed or what. But I called the restaurant and confirmed they do a veggie special everyday. And by the way, it's only $25.

We even hosted a significant birthday party for my husband in their private room a few years back.\n\nUnfortunately, last weekend we were quite disappointed.   We went on Saturday to celebrate Valentines Day, so really wanted to have a special and great meal.   We were considering Masa or Gary Danko, but opted for Boulevard because it had been a while since we had been there.\n\nTo me, a 3 star review is a serious criticism for a place of this calibre.   We were hoping for some advice from the sommelier about a particular wine.  Our waiter indicated he would have him sent over.  After about 15 minutes of waiting with no word, we received help from another waiter who was quite knowledgeable.    Strike 1.   My husband ordered a filet mignon cooked \"medium.\"   Well, it came quite rare.  Pretty surprising for a restaurant of this caliber.   They redid both of our meals, but that was it.    When I have to send back my meal because it isn't -objectively- properly cooked I expect at least an apology or some kind of gesture to make up for the meal.   Most high calibre restaurants would remove the charge for part a meal that they botched.   Nothing of the sort at Boulevard that night, which left me really annoyed.

The menu is classic American cuisine--great, fresh produce, traditional combinations, an older crowd, an exquisite wine list, and cocktails that Mad Men's Don Draper would aptly describe as \"simple and significant.\" \n\nI dined at Boulevard last week with my sister and her husband. The bufala mozzarella in the caprese appetizer was the best bufala I have ever had. The tomatoes were succulent, and the basil was fresh. To be honest, the rest of the meal was sort of a blur. I'm not sure if that was a product of the great conversation and company, or if it was because the food was great, but not  as mind-blowing as I expected. I ordered the lamb t-bone which was delicious, but not memorable. The best dish of the table, however, was the wood-oven roasted angus filet mignon that my sister ordered. This steak was to die for--perfectly cooked, juicy, excellent! The crisp fingerling potatoes that came with it were equally tasty. \n\nAll in all, this was a lovely place to dine, but not \"the best\" culinary experience I have had to date.", "author": "Vassi I."}

The kitchen is open and the tables that are parallel to the kitchen can see the chefs running back and forth.  The bar is fully stocked and it was empty the night we went.  This reminds me of a place straight out of Gotham.  It doesn't seem like the sort of establishment you can stumble into while strolling down the street.\n\nThey seated us at a small table that was pushed up against a metal gate near the bar.  To my immediate left was a group of 4 people speak Japanese the entire time, so it wasn't too hard to tune them out.  It wasn't the best seating in the world, I felt hidden off to the side.  As we got situated I noticed they left me a black napkin.  YES!!!!  I finally found a place that hands out black napkins if you're wearing black.  I almost thought that the black napkin thing was a myth...so many lint filled days.  Anyway, back to the review.\n\nWe started with the Maine lobster and shrimp ravioli and it was delicious!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-05", "description": "A few years ago Boulevard was a destination.  If you wanted to let people know that you have finally arrived, Boulevard was it.  We used to take our important clients here for lunch in the late 1990s and our important new hires - in the early 2000s.\n\nFast forward to 2009, and a lot has changed.  Gary Danko, Michael Mina and Aqua made Boulevard slightly less relevant, but it's still a great spot for a business lunch. Instead of celebrating new hires, we said farewell to two of our employees who were leaving the company.  Whatever the reason for dining here, I still adore Boulevard for the atmosphere, ambiance and consistency. \n\nWe made reservations for a group of 10.  They asked us for a credit card, which would be charged a $100 cancellation fee should we fail to show up.  I thought it was an unnecessarily strict policy, until I realized that they set up a private room for us.  The room, located to the right of the main dining room, is a small wine cellar with a table big enough for 10-12 people.  The room had stone walls, a monastery-like ceiling and wine racks filled with bottles.  It was like dining in a grotto - a bit creepy yet secluded and beautiful.  I am not sure whether they put us in that room to keep us away from the rest of the customers, but it worked.\n\nFor my first course, I went with Ahi Tuna Tartar.  It was served on a long, thin plate along with mushroom tempura.  The tuna was very good, although the tiny Japanese cucumber cubes sprinkled all over seemed to overwhelm the tender taste of tuna.  The miatake mushroom tempura was served with some sauce that tasted like wasabi mayo.  A bit too strong for my taste.  The tuna tartar itself was great, almost as good as Aqua's.\n\nFor my main course, I went with the Kobe Bavette steak, medium rare.  The steak (about 6 oz) was tender and flavorful.  It's a shame there wasn't more of it.  I wish it'd come on a bed of another steak, not on a bed of spinach . . . I left the spinach on the plate, and I cannot speak to its quality.  The steak was served with potatoes, crushed with shallots and bacon.  Dee-licious.  All this was served with a dollop of creme fraiche, which had a unique sweet taste, making it more suitable for a dessert course.\n\nSpeaking of dessert, I went with a Banana Dulce De Leche Truffle cake.  Caramelized banana was slightly overcooked, making caramel taste slightly burnt.  I enjoyed the dulce de leche sauce which went well with my vanilla ice cream (I asked them to substitute chocolate for vanilla).\n\nOur waitress was extremely professional and handled our 10-person party with ease.  I was surprised how polished the service was, and how proper the table setting was.  The knives, the plates, the iced tea in a glass decanter - all pointed to a high class establishment.  Boulevard also did NOT add the tip to the bill, even for a party of 10.  It actually worked out in the waitress' favor, but she really did deserve that 19% tip.  A 3-course meal for 10 + a few drinks + a bottle of wine for the table + tip = $800.  Ouch.\n\nGreat restaurant, great service.  I'll be back as soon as I am allowed to use the company credit card at lunch again.", "author": "Yan G."}

Every time he and his wife visited SF,  they always went to this restaurant. So when we knew our friend had limited time left, we wanted to have a special experience at their favorite restaurant for him.\n\nWe called a month in advance to set up the reservation. I specifically asked for a table for six, upstairs with a view. I explained the circumstances of our friend and his illness. I then checked to confirm this reservation two weeks ahead, and finally the day of. We all wanted this evening to be special.\n\nSo we all arrive at the Boulevard, convening in the bar for pre-dinner cocktails. We arrived 30 minutes early and were told our table was not ready. We had a second round. Then when we checked in to the hostess stand, we were told our table had been given away and it would be 90 minutes before another table upstairs was opened. After all the pre-planning we had done, communicating to the restaurant, we were so disappointed. We were seated in the middle of the downstairs area. So basically every time someone opened the door to go to the bathrooms you got a breeze. The noise was insane, we could hardly hear each other. It just got worse from here.\n\nOur server was not friendly at all. She did not have anything favorite to recommend nor did she encourage trying an appetizer. She went out of her way to act like it was not her choice to wait on us at all. The ticket times on everything were horrible. We received our appetizers, then about 4 minutes later our salads, and then not 5 minutes after that our entrees. This is really confusing for me because the coho and the pork chop were both way over cooked. At this point, most of us are feeling really uncomfortable because of how obvious it was the server did not want to wait on us. We asked for a manager twice. The manager came out, gave a semi - believable apology and offered us each a free dessert. We picked two desserts which were decent. Then the server charged us for them. At this point we were so exasperated. I waited around to get the ticket fixed. I asked the server what her problem was after my party had left. She did not think anything was out of order or wrong with anything she did at all. \n\nSo my dear friend's last experience at the Boulevard was a disaster. It has taken me a long time to put this in writing but it was such a shame it had to turn out this way. I will never visit this restaurant again.", "author": "Jason K."}

When we entered (no posted hours, by the way), the petite manager/hostess gave us her best Minnie Mouse impression and said, \"I'm sorry, we stop serving at 2:15.\" \n\"Well what time is it?\" I asked, pulling out my phone. I looked at it and turned to my friend. \"It's 2:20.\" Minnie just smiled. The restaurant was full of people. Minnie rattled off the names of some other area restaurants she thought might still be serving. I was less than thrilled so I said, \"By five minutes, really? We made a special trip to come here and had trouble parking...\" She just smiled and said nothing. I looked around at the full restaurant and gave her my best \"bitch are you for real\" face. [At this point my friend said she wanted to say, \"Yeah I'm black and my friend has blue hair but this is San Francisco, don't make us get all Seven on Your Side.\"] Minnie squeaked that she'd go ask her kitchen. She returned and patronizingly said, \"You can eat but you have to pick something RIGHT AWAY.\" Um, okay. \nBut, once we were seated? The service was spectacular. We were not rushed and when I made some mention to our waitress of how I knew we had to order quickly she just waved her hand dismissively. She was great. \nNow on to the food!!! Oh, man, it was fantastic. They do not miss a trick. My favorite was the lobster bisque soup. Paired with their amazing, crusty, spongy bread and butter I wanted it to last forever. I also enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad and my friend's shrimp salad looked as divine as little lobsters. We both had the scallop entr\u00e9e and they were impeccable. I'm not a big risotto fan but it was well-cooked and savory. We also enjoyed a few different options from the drink menu. If you don't drink you should still check out their cocktail menu as they have the best non-alcoholic listings I've seen in any San Francisco restaurant. I had an Arnold Palmer with fresh lemonade, but they had other more amazing-sounding beverages with muddled mint, etc. For lunch, with both of us having soup, a starter, an entr\u00e9e and an [albeit nonalcoholic] drink from the bar, we spent about $50 each before tip. Considering it would be easy to spend twice that much on their dinner menu I'd recommend lunch as a great way to try this amazing restaurant and not break the bank. Just make sure to get there by 2:15 because Minnie Mouse shuts that place down like it's a McDonald's.", "author": "Jane P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-09-26", "description": "My husband and I went to Boulevard for our Anniversary the other day. Let me start by saying that we eat out quite a bit and have had some amazing meals. We have also previously eaten at Bouelvards sister restaurant, Prospect, which was amazing and a 5-star experience all around. Based on that, I was looking forward to Boulevard. Boy are they completely different!  \n\nService at both restaurants were amazing so I am surprised that Boulevard was knocked on their service in prior reviews. Our waiter was prompt, knew the menu, offered his opinion (this is huge in my book, I hate when a waiter tells me that eveything is amazing and has no opinion), offered suggestions (I told him what type of wine I was looking to start with before we opened the bottle we brought and he made the perfect suggestion based on what I was looking for) and made us aware of the wine policy (corkage is waived on the bottle we brought if we buy a bottle from them, even if it's a half bottle). I will say that the gentleman that was our bus boy was extremely sub-par not refilling water, bread or removing the empty plates which the waiter compensated for. The waiter did pretty much everything on his own and did it extremely promt and attentive. 5 Stars for our waiter. \n\nAmbience was nice but Prospect felt a lot more upscale, private and quiet. Prospect felt like a restaurant worthy of over $100 per person while I felt Boulevard felt like an upscale bar that people working in the area would frequent for Happy Hour. Not a Michelin Star rated restaurant. \n\nThe food was the biggest disappointment of all. It was just ok. We had 2 app's (Ravioli's & Scallops), 2 salads (Heirloom Tomato & Fig) and 2 entree's (Quail & Pork Chop) we both shared and nothing stood out. Nothing was worthy of the Michelin Star. As a matter of fact, the ravioli's were down right gross. It said they were filled with Duck or something or the other. 3 ravioli's came and 1 was the meat filled and the other 2 were filled with a bitter spinach, not cheese and spinach, just bitter spinach. Every store bought ravioli I have ever had bet the pants off of these. We decided to cut our losses and go elsewhere for dessert it was such a disappointment. The entire meal we compared the food to other restaurants and their sister restaurant. Even the bread at Prospect feels more like a Michelin rated restaurant than Boulevard. At Propect they have people delivering a piece of fresh baked bread that is amazing hot out of the oven as it comes out. It sucked having to wait for your next piece as they made their was around the dining room but it was amazing and felt like a high end restaurant whereas as Boulevard, they drop off a plate of cold sourdough that is very run of the mill. To me it's little stuff like that, that makes an experience. \n\nNeedless to say, we won't go back to Boulevard but we will be going back to their sister restaurant Prospect. Based on my experience I can't understand the Michelin rating and the \"Best Restaurant\" award.", "author": "Christina F."}

Time had been kind after all - It could have shown it's face as worn, jaded and stale, but instead Boulevard has evolved and progressed into a well respected and matured old steadfast that keeps patrons coming back to time and time again. The crowd here seems to be just as \"mature\" as it's beloved establishment, so as a thirty something four top we were the minority.  But the food was fresh and fun (like our four top I like to think) and I have to be honest when I say I was looking for things to tear apart about the food -  but I just could not find anything. Starting with the bread that was warm, sour and chewy (but that's easy, this is The City) followed by my beet carpacio that stood out from those I've had before. This one had whispers of mint and pistachio and the beets were paper thin and required little effort in chewing. I then had the halibut which was seared perfectly on the exterior and contained a succulent, moist and completely seasoned interior. It was accompanied by green, young chickpeas which were creamy and earthy. I choose, without a second thought, the lemon tart. So unassuming and humble, yet so easy to get wrong. To my unexpected surprise, this was, by and large, the most excellent lemon dessert of it's kind I've ever had before or since. The crust was all at once rich, buttery, tender and light, and the lemon filling was sweet and zingy and bursting with lemon flavor. I can never find a lemon bar, tart or pie that is lemony enough for me with the correct balance of sweetness, but this one left nothing to want for. It was topped with an ethereal, marshmallow-like, toasted swiss meringue. It was thick and rich and clung to the plate. My fork kept scraping at the remnants that were the only evidence remaining of the sublime dessert. I was so completely full before the dessert even arrived, and yet it was beyond my self control or better judgment to finish the entire thing, it was so delicious. The service was fine, it wasn't some of the warmest I've had but also not the most aloof or pretentious I've had. Not memorable either way. But what was memorable was the food. And isn't that why we go out? To eat? We don't go out to get served, we go out to eat. And so it remains that Boulevard holds a special place in my memory for the spectacular food, and I pray that 8 or 9 years won't pass again before a new memory is made.", "author": "Veronica E."}

She was nice, professional, easy to deal with and very clear.  Everything she said, she did; when we arrived everything was as we expected.\n\nThe Room:  The main dining room is classic SF with postcard views of the bay bridge.  The private room is downstairs, but very well appointed, as you would expect\n\nService:  Impeccable.  Brian was the head waiter and the entire operation ran smoothly, like a well oiled machine.  Timing was perfect, food was hot and every order was correct.  Changes and other special needs were handled quickly and easily.  Not a single guest complained...and these were not shy people.\n\nThe food: \nApp: Dungeness Crab Salad w/ cr\u00e8me fraiche dressing, served over tomatoes and topped w/ white asparagus.  Delicious, well balanced and hit all the right notes.\n\nMain: Choice of Halibut or Pork Chop.  Their pork order was low that week, and they volunteered to add filet mignon to the menu at no step up charge.  Flavors were on point, setups matched perfectly, everything cooked as ordered.  Smiles all around.\n\nDessert: choice of cr\u00e8me brulee or butterscotch pudding with chocolate ganache cookie.  I opted for the latter and was smitten.  The cr\u00e8me brulee was delicious, but standard--as it should be.  \n\nMost people can only hope for a perfect wedding day, I got lucky and lived it.

Appetizers were so-so and the portions small for the cost. Nothing special about the the entrees.  The restaurant has become too big and busy and has not maintained the quality and flavors it once produced. Service was good although our server had no personality. Wine list is way overpriced. I saw mark ups of three times + over cost. I always feel ripped off when restaurants mark up their wines that much.  I have a feeling that this restaurant is resting on its laurels.

Boulevard was definitely a one time experience. \nMy two friends and I shared 2 appetizers-the scallops and the ravioli. Each dish came with three of each (coincidence?), and they were both around $16. They were both well prepared, though the ravioli was on the cold side, it was covered in truffles, which I discovered taste nothing like truffle oil, nice surprise. We then split two entrees suggested by the waitress, the sole which came with shrimp (2) and scallops (1), and the fillet. I am not a beef eater, but for the money I was contributing to a $39 piece of meat (which was very small), you better believe I ate it. Add in a few cocktails, a few glasses of wine (3 of each), and you've got yourself a $212 tab. Like I said, one time experience.", "author": "Sarah M."}

We started off with a special pasta dish to share with white truffles, which was absolutely fabulous. I recommend not sharing it, and getting it as your starter. For main dishes I would highly recommend the Kurabuta Pork or the Filet of beef. Both were excellent dishes. We passed on the dessert and went with a cheese plate. The cheese plate is good, but not great. Nobody beats Garyo Danko for cheeses. The restaurant was packed like always, even 5 years ago during the recession. The service was pretty good, and I recommend getting the table in the back of the restaurant so you can enjoy the views of the Bay Bridge both for dinner and lunch. Overall, a great place to come enjoy a fine meal with friends or on date night. A little tweaks here and there and this place will be 5 stars on my list.

They told me that they would look for it and call me back. After an hour, they called to let me know that they hadn't found it. My flight back was scheduled the day after and without my ID, which was in my wallet, it would have impossible to fly. I spent all day juggling a police report and phone calls to the airline in order to arrange some sort of identification (no money, no credit cards, and no ID). At 6 PM, I received a phone call from the restaurant, informing me that after a cleaning, they found the wallet (I had a feeling they hadn't looked the first time that I called). I rushed to the restaurant, grabbed my wallet (and thanked them of course) only to get back to the hotel to realize that I was missing $180. Very kind of them to not take all $190...

My husband ordered it medium rare, and it was tender and perfectly seasoned.  It was spot on.  The scallops I ordered was nice and delicate.  I'm a big fan of scallops so I can always appreciate them when it's well executed and Boulevard did just that.  The duck breast was divine and I enjoyed every last bite of it. \nThe wines on the other hand was not as good as I expected.  I ordered a glass of beaujolais to start off with but it tasted as if it had been opened for more than 3 days.  The smell was a good indication that the wine was old so it was not a good start for me.  My second glass was the Morgan pinot noir but I regret ordering it because it tasted young and not quite ready to drink.  I would've loved to order a bottle of wine that I was familiar with but my husband doesn't drink.  My wine choices were limited to wines by the glass or half bottles which none appealed to me.  I find it strange that the restaurant served their wines by the glass in a different glass from those who ordered wines by the bottle.  My two glasses were served in a glass that was slightly bigger than the white wine glassware.  I expected the pinot noir to be served in a burgundy glassware so I felt a slight isolation from those who purchased a bottle and received the appropriate glassware.  Another thing I found odd was how the table was set.  The silverware were all turned over facing down, but I digress.\nI gave them four stars because of their service and wine.  The server did his job but was not very engaging with our table.  I was bummed that they didn't put a candle or special message on our dessert for our anniversary.  I was hoping for a special experience with my husband because I expected more from a  restaurant of this caliber.  Overall the food was great and would recommend their food to any foodie.

This is the only restaurant I booked in San Francisco solely based on reviews instead of recommendations from friends and I'm really glad I did.  \n\nThe restaurant is adorable and we were seated in one of their cute loveseats against a window.  We were immediately brought out sourdough bread, which they promptly replaced everytime we finished it.  We finally had to ask them to stop bringing us bread!   \n\nThe appetizers we had were fantastic.  We ordered the abalone, which we had also had the night before at Michael Mina and I have to say, the abalone at Boulevard was much better.  We also ordered the local calamari with dungeness crab which was great.  I am normally not a fan of grilled octopus but this was delicious.  \n\nFor main courses, my boyfriend had the quail which he cannot stop talking about.  He said it was the best bird he's every eaten.  I ordered the california sea bass which was very good but I had heard their seafood is not as good as their meat.  My only complaint is that the asparagus they served with it didn't go well with the other flavors and were too big and meaty.  I think they served it to keep with the green theme on the plate. \n\nI do have to ask why in San Francisco are the restrooms in another building?  Wish they were closer - and this was one of the many restaurants we encountered this in.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-06", "description": "I can see why Boulevard has one Michelin star, but I can also see why it has only one. The service was pleasant, gracious, and unpretentious, but our food did take a very long time to arrive. The decor is attractive, but the lighting is a little dated -- and those antiqued posters are only cool if they're originals. The wine list is solid, but not terribly exciting. \n\nFor appetizers, we tried the calamari, the abalone, and the heirloom tomato and bufala mozzarella salad. The calamari was fine, but not quite as good as a similar dish I've had many times at Divino in Belmont. The abalone was well-cooked, and the abalone mushrooms were fine, but not thrilling. The heirloom tomato salad was ok, but not great; only the purple cherokee tomato in the salad was as good as the ones I've bought at the farmer's market, and the mozzarella di bufala was not as good as some I've bought at the grocery store, as it was a little on the bland side.\n\nFor an entree, I tried the California sea bass, and this was where I really started to get impressed: this is a fish I don't think I've tried before, and as the server mentioned to me when I ordered it, it has a very firm texture, almost like chicken. It was well-seasoned and well-cooked, with a lovely golden crispy tinge. The beans served alongside were lovely, and the dish as a whole was well-composed. My husband's quail and squab was good, but not thrilling; a very solid, competent dish, but not a knockout. \n\nThe most compelling reason to go back to Boulevard, for me, is the dessert. We shared the cake donut with buttermilk ice cream, and it was absolutely fantastic. Normally I'm not a fan of cake donuts, but this one was glorious -- luxuriously cakey without being too rich, infused with a rich citrusy flavor, and lightly coated with sugar for a perfect amount of crunch. The buttermilk ice cream was beautifully light on the palate, with a tart, acidic bite. It was the perfect foil for the cake donut. There was also a dollop of raspberry sorbet on the plate, which added a nice splash of color.\n\nAlthough Boulevard won't deeply excite the most adventurous foodies, the dishes are well-executed. The views are good, the service is good, it's a pretty, pleasant place to have a meal, and it's not hard to get a reservation. The Michelin star is deserved -- especially if you order dessert.", "author": "Sarah F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-23", "description": "\"Fuck my liiife,\" uttered the pantry cook after seeing my order for beef carpaccio come in. \"Time to get a new job.\"\n\nI was one of the first customers of the day and it was the first carpaccio of the day, and the beef hadn't been sliced yet. Did he not see the table number and realize I was sitting at the open kitchen's counter directly in front of him as he grumbled, or did he say it hoping to make me feel bad for causing him such stress so early in the service? \n\nEither way, I didn't really care - it's the life of a cook, with which I am very familiar. Restaurants are always putting items on the menu that require a few steps too many to make, thus decreasing enjoyment of preparation for their maker. There may not have been love in the dish, but precision and quality certainly were, and this helped to brighten what was the only dark point in my two-hour lunch. I waited 15 minutes - while sipping a perfect fresh blood orange martini - for the carpaccio to arrive, but that was understandable, and absolutely worth it.\n\nThe paper-thin, grass-fed Angus beef, lubricated with a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil, nearly disintegrated upon contact with my tongue. Its delicacy tempered the accompanying roasted chanterelles, which were too salty on their own but made beautiful love to the meat and my palate. Flavorwise, I would say the scattering of tempura-fried green beans did little, as their gently sweet beany-ness was overshadowed by a peppery tangle of baby arugula that also shared the plate, but their perfectly (PERFECTly) done batter lent a needed light crispness. As an ensemble, with a tiny bit of each component on every forkful, this was one of the best appetizers I have ever eaten.\n\nEndorphins continued to flood my body for the rest of the meal, which may be due partly to that very strong martini earlier but probably because everything else also exceeded expectations. The wood-oven-roasted pork flat iron (a cut from the tender shoulder) boasted a deep, beautiful char and scrumptiously juicy, flavorful meat, all thanks to brining - always a smart move with today's lean pigs. The pork stood on its own, but so did its sides: pancetta-saut\u00e9ed Brussels sprouts, grilled Mission figs, and a chestnut puree that could have been served in a bowl as cream of chestnut soup. This dish in particular was fun to eat; I felt like I was playing with food in an acceptable adult manner. So I began to tinker. To the pork, the cabbage-ettes and pancetta respectively offered a slight chlorophyllic bitterness and a chewy, salty-spicy porkiness. The figs, chestnut puree and pancetta together made for a delicious threesome. But my favorite was the pork with a cut of fig and a schmear of chestnut: a match made in hog heaven.\n\nAlthough I was nearly full to bursting, I couldn't pass up a taste of Boulevard's house-made frozen treats. The sarsaparilla ice cream was American childhood nostalgia set into a sphere of goodness, and coupled with a little snickerdoodle it nearly made me giggle like a kid. I thought of lazy Sundays in Hale'iwa as I spooned my way through a pineapple sorbet. But the real kicker was a dark chocolate-covered salted-caramel ice cream bonbon, a perfect sweet ending to a fantastic meal, well-attended to throughout by my gracious, engaging server.\n\nIf you know how professional kitchens operate, you'll love sitting in front of the kitchen as I did. Boulevard's involved, multifaceted dishes can only be pulled off with the kind of seamless teamwork I observed. The cooks, who are constantly exchanging the typical X-rated kitchen banter in Spanish (\"This fucking whore\" to a special order, \"I'll bang your grandma on the pastry counter,\" for instance), don't waste a movement and will jump in to help he who may be falling behind.\n\nHopefully the grumpy pantry cook doesn't quit, since he seems to be especially good buds with his side-by-side co-worker who prepares the hot items for appetizers. Breaking brotherhood in the kitchen could lead to a temporary falter in Boulevard's high standards, and I'd hate to see that happen.", "author": "Tadd T."}

This is for a meal I had there in Oct 2008.  Absolutely, hands-down, the second best meal I've had in San Francisco.  Maybe anywhere.  (The first was by way of knowing the sommelier at Jardini\u00e8re, so I'm not sure that's fair).\n\nSome college friends were coming into town and as is our tradition, I wanted to do some destination dining.  On the advice of a friend, decided to try Boulevard.  Amazingly, I was able to get a reservation about a week in advance and they were extremely accommodating with me as our party kept growing in size, from 4 to eventually 7.\n\nFor whatever reason, they were able to open up the private room for us (I guess it wasn't booked on that particular Saturday.  Score!)  They said it could have seated 10.  It was the wine cellar, although I'm not sure it's the main wine cellar as I only saw the sommelier come through once to take a bottle off the wall.  Maybe I was having too good a time to notice.  This was one of the few times in my life I've enjoyed a meal away from the hoi polloi and my simpleton heart was sent aflutter.  The details are a little hazy now, but I enjoyed every moment of the experience.  Good food and good friends are always a good time, but I'm sure Boulevard had a great deal to do with it.\n\nWe split a few appetizers.  I recall the foie gras being a particular standout.  Upon the recommendation of some kind of framed posting in the men's restroom, my friend noted that the sweetbreads were to be tried, and despite the less than appealing location of the inspiration, it was spot on.\n\nThe sommelier was extremely helpful in recommending some wine pairings for our meal, and knowledgeable too when we pointed out some types and regions we had tried before.  Our food came at perfect intervals and the wait staff was almost invisible, but always seemed to anticipate our needs, down to the letter.  I remember at one point I dropped a fork and before I had time to ask for another, a new one was there waiting for me.\n\nAs I remember, if it weren't for the upscale decor and me being dressed up for the occasion, I would have licked the plate my lamb entree came on.\n\nDesserts?  We were awash in warm chocolate cake and creme brulee to write home about.  I think I had some scotch as well, which blended the night together perfectly.  I know I'm making this sound like some kind of dining nirvana, and perhaps the spirit of that night and the time since have worn away any rough edges on those memories, but I can't help myself.  It was just that good.\n\nThe drinks from the bar was quite good as well.\n\nIn total, the bill for 7 people, with split appetizers, entrees, desserts, 3 bottles of decent wine, and some after dinner drinks came out to be less than $800.  it was worth every penny.\n\nI would definitely go back.  I'm just looking for the right occasion.  It would be perfect for a special occasion with family.  If I'm ever in the position to get the private room, I would take it in a heartbeat.  Great location too.", "author": "Zhi Q."}

Three years ago, we finally had the chance and excuse, with out-of-town foodie guests visiting. \n\nWhat a nightmare. \n\nShortly after we placed our orders, the restaurant (and surrounding neighborhood) lost power. Okay, that's a PG&E issue, not a Boulevard issue... Except, from that point on (about 9:00 ish), they kept us hostage waiting for our food and PROMISING that we'd still be able to be fed because they still had the wood fire stove going and the power would be back up, surely.\n\nAfter 45 minutes of waiting for the appetizers, we suggested that perhaps we should leave and come back some other time. \"No, no, no!!! Don't be silly! We'll have your food RIGHT out!!!\" were the assurances of the staff. \n\nAfter waiting for TWO HOURS to get our appetizers, they finally conceded that they would not be able to provide dinner. Great... This is San Francisco, not New York, and restaurants (besides Mel's, In & Out or Tommy's Joynt) tend to shut down by 10:00, and we're VERY HUNGRY at this point. \n\nJust to really finish the evening, they charged us full price for everything we'd ordered, including coffee, if you can believe it. We put up a minor stink, but were fed the argument that the business had lost money that night because of the lack of power and, ergo, we, the few remaining suckers who'd stuck it out, needed to pay up.\n\nBullshit. That's what insurance is for. \n\nWe were so incensed, it took two weeks to simmer down before my husband could craft a letter to the management. Surely, at least an apology would be in order. We honestly thought we were doing the restaurant a favor by informing the management of what a deplorable experience we'd had. \n\nBIG MISTAKE!!! The return letter followed the same argument as that which we'd heard from the staff on the evening in question... that the restaurant had lost money that night, etc, etc. No apology, no request that we come back and try it again, nothing. \n\nI don't care how good the food is.

It's where all yer high-powered finance guys and VCs love to lunch. We sat toward the front and I swear to god every time a group of guys got up to leave I was positively raked over on their way out the door. And so it goes in the testosterone-charged world of money making.  But it's not just the elite with their highly evolved wine list analysis skills who dine here. Admins and lowly office assistants come here as well, dressed in Banana Republic sweaters and pants, and order their bowl of soup, hoping to be noticed by the big shot male clientele. It's an interesting study in San Francisco culture and sexuality, lunch time at Boulevard is.\n\nMy friend was able to get reservations for 1pm as it was already 11:30 by the time he called. We valeted and were seated immediately upon arrival. The hostesses are very pleasant and there isn't a hint of attitude here.\n\nOur waiter was the consummate professional - knowledgeable about the menu and alert to our needs without being obtrusive. And you have to love a fine restaurant  where the waiter gives you a choice of tap water and doesn't wince if you choose that over bottled.\n\nI had the lobster bisque for starters and it's perfection. My friend had the pancetta stuffed ravioli. \n\nFor my main course I decided on the Kobe Bavette with baked fingerling potatoes with crme fraiche, smoked Bacon & chives, sauteed spinach in a gorgeous and flavorful reduction sauce. What is a bavette you ask? I have no idea. But I do know it's a tasty hunk of meat. Because it was a very warm day today the meal was a bit heavy but delicious. Listen, I'm not going to say don't eat at Boulevard on a hot day. But there's not much in the way of light fare on the menu. My friend had the halibut. We both enjoyed our dishes very much.\n\nPricey? But of course! This is Boulevard!\n\nAfter a delicious latte we had to skedaddle. It was a nice treat to start the week : )", "author": "Alison P."}

Not knowing anything about the restaurant I researched it on Yelp, and was impress by the menu and the reviews. So off to the restaurant we went.\nLike the ignorant pagans we were, the four of us showed up with no reservations, hoping to get a seat at the bar or a table. The hostess, upon hearing we were a four top without a reservation look at us like we clearly did not know where were at all. The quoted wait of two and hours barely crossed her lips when she pointed to a small round table tuck away in the alcove in the bar and told us to grab it now.\nAs luck would have it, the waiter turned that table into a four top complete with all the linens and tableware needed. This is where one of the best Epicurean experiences of my life was about to take place. Let me tell I have been cooking professionally for 30 plus years and have experienced restaurants on every continent on this earth save one, it was too cold and the dining options were only mess halls.\nAfter perusing the wine list I settled on a Pinot Noir from the Frances Thompson Vineyard by Flowers. Good Juice when you can get it. We looked at the menu and selected five appetizers to sample. Four of the five appetizers ransacked my taste buds with such imagination and superior flavor marriages that they were clearly illegal in at least 49 states. The Foie gras, Scallops with black truffles, Calamari and Abalone, and the heirloom tomato salad with Burata, were clearly champions of the appetizer page. There is no reason to go into detail on each one of these at all. There is no way anyone should ever take the ranting of a crazed chef as a testament to their creative prowess. One just needs to go online and make a reservation and get educated. The fifth appetizer was good, a cheese raviolini with eggplant, flavorful but truly pedestrian sitting on the same table with the app gods.\nThe entrees where excellent and were well thought out in appearance and flavor. I had the salmon, to my right was the duck breast wrapped in pancetta, and other two positions on the table due to any  lack of sear imagination and understanding of the ingredients that been paraded on the table for the last hour, each choose the Halibut. The duck clearly was hands winner of the three.\nWe opted for a second bottle of Flowers and passed on dessert. I clearly set myself up for the sequel.\nYou know I recently dined with a genius of flavor and had an experience in a restaurant that startled me. The ingredients that the chef choose, the preparations he executed, all were just awe inspiring. My partner in the meal, had spent time reading the menu on line and came to the table with a lot of pre conceived notions and opinions. I implore come to this restaurant and any restaurant with an open mind and look upon each dish as a painting or any other art median you want to. Experience it for what is and try not to figure it out for any reason.

They did a wonderful job making the space warm and festive. The service is impeccable, very attentive and friendly! \n\nI started with the scallop starter dish.  The scallops are on the small side but were perfectly cooked and very tasty.  The 3 small scallops comes served over risotto.  I did not have the risotto because I wanted to save room but to be overly critical because I have to be I mean this is one of the best restaurants in SF, the risotto looked a bit oily.  The scallops were tasty but for the $15 plus price tag I don't know if I would be as satisfied if I paid out of pocket. \n\nFor lunch I had the Organic Chicken Cobb Salad.  The presentation was unusual but coming from a picky eater I enjoyed how all the ingredients came separated on one plate.  If you've eaten out with me you know there are certain foods I don't like touching each other. So to get a salad of all meals being served with ingredients separated I was pleasantly surprised.

Come here for the extravagant food above everything else.  Everything we had was par excellence.  For starters, the dayboat sea scallops were perfectly cooked and delicious and the seared sonoma foie gras formed a perfect combo with strawberries and balsamic vinegar.  For entrees, the oven roasted suckling pig is phenomenal in its three variations, especially the sausage, and the BBQ Angus short rib is tender and succulent.

While waiting for our table, we sat at the bar and ordered some cocktails.  They make them strong at the Boulevard Bar - definitely 5 stars for that alone =D  And I love the little touches they put into everything - they even give you a tiny bowl in which to discard your olive pits from your martini.  Love that!\n\nAs we were being brought to our table, we were greeted by a quirky, albeit very nice, waiter who was a lean Mr. Clean's doppelganger, and who was on the ball and had great recommendations.

Of course walking into a nice dining establishment wearing some jeans and a pair of Hi-Top Vans (albeit paired with a nice button down shirt) you kind of almost expect to not get great treatment, but it was quite the contrary.\n\nStarted off with the seared calamari and artichokes, which was quite honestly, perfectly cooked. I think the sauce was a *wee bit* on the heavy side, but the flavors were amazing.  (and bear in mind, I have had a massive allergy attack all week and can barely breathe through my nose, so to still taste everything means it's good!) Had a nice white burgundy with it, which, although a bit overpriced, was MOST excellent. \n\nMoved on to a Rioja tasting to see if it might pair well with my main course...tasty wine, but not quite right with the Cod dish I picked. \n\nThe main...seared Cod with white shrimp and Italian beans with a local Farmani chorizo and a buerre blanc. Holy SH*T this was AMAZING!!!! I find that sometimes it's hard to get a perfectly cooked piece of fish, let alone pair it with another seafood AND a \"land meat\", but this was the perfect combo. Fish was done to perfection, chorizo \"strips\" were the perfect accent to the shrimp and the sauce....I coulda eaten double the portion...well, my mouth could have anyway - I am actually quite stuffed while typing this.\n\nFinished off with a light pistachio ice cream bonbon, which...was accented with the cutest little piece of chocolate that said \"happy birthday\" on it. The absolutely ADORABLE waitress we had (Desiree - you deserve a raise !!!) remembered that when we 1st arrived that this was a belated birthday meal for me, and remembered to add that little tidbit (alongside her excellent service and assistance with wine pairing, etc.). You know when you get the personal touch that you're at a great dining spot, and we definitely got that. \n\n(and did I mention how CUTE she was? SO CUTE!!!) \n\nAt any rate...the staff seemed very friendly, the courses were served at appropriate times, and the food was delicious. \n\nMy only (minor) complaint was, the wines were a bit on the higher priced side for what they were...comparable East Bay spots would charge less for the same wines, but for the total experience, I feel that Boulevard hit the mark. \n\nSince I work all of 3 blocks away, I will DEFINITELY be back. (and will most likely be asking for the lovely Desiree to be my waitress - she was honestly delightful!)\n\nIf you want a fine dining experience without the obnoxious prices (the rates were quite reasonable considering) then Boulevard is a great spot to check out.\n\nHappy birthday to me!", "author": "Marco M."}

Sure, it's one of those quintessential SF restaurants, it's always on Zagat's top 50 most popular restaurants in SF, and people gush over it like vodka on Britney Spears.  I tried to like this place, I really did, but it just didn't float my boat.\n\nOther than the nice view of the bay bridge, I didn't get that special \"razzle-dazzle\" feeling in my loins that really special restraunts (and cheap underwear) provide.  Make no mistake, the food is well prepared and tastes fine, but I was not impressed by the complexity of the dishes or the level of service... especially at this price point.  Boulevard's a busy place and I felt like a leper during most of my visit as waitstaff seemed too preoccupied catering to the older gentlemen in suits or to the private dining room.  Well dammit!  Lepers have feelings too!!!  To be fair, one of the kindly busboys took pity on me and offered me bread and water... \n\nAnyway, I left Boulevard somewhat disappointed and insecure.  I kept thinking, \"What on earth are others seeing in this place that I'm obviously missing??\"\n\nI may never know as my leprous brain may not be capable of understanding such abstract ideas.", "author": "Gracie-C Y."}

I got a seat at the bar while we waited for our table. After some cocktails, we were taken to a crappy table (ok it was packed but we had reservations) and I could tell my friend was pissed but did not want to make an issue so we sat by the door (which was not the best spot since it was cold that night and tons of people = crappy table) and started to check out the menu. Since he had been here before, I decided to ask what was good. I tried the Ahi Tuna Tartare followed by the  Kobe beef (which it looks like they no longer list on their menu).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-18", "description": "I went to Boulevard with a date for a late dinner, around 9. The place was still packed and we had to wait in the bar about 15 minutes after our reservation time to be seated.\n\nAfter that, though, the service was excellent. I never had to fill my wine glass, empty dishes never sat on the table for more than a few minutes, used silverware was immediately replenished, and crumbs were swept away promptly. I don't generally eat anywhere where anybody does any of those things.\n\nThe atmosphere was fairly crowded and bustling, but not unpleasant. The ceilings are crazy arched brick vaults, the floor in the bar is a mosaic of tiny tile pieces with a large peacock at the front, a motif that is repeated throughout the restaurant. The front side of the restaurant faces Mission, but the back side looks out over the Bay Bridge across the Embarcadero. The wall columns were riveted plate steel painted white, and all in all the decor was really beautiful.\n\nThe bathroom is a trek, but is stylish and well-maintained.\n\nI had the squab breast with a couple of sweetbreads, four small, square potato gnocchi, and a pair of chantrelle mushrooms. A small appetizer, but delicious.\n\nFor the main course, I had the braised duck breast, which was a little less cooked than I expected and which was served with a single pyramid-shaped ravioli filled with all manner of things, from black truffle and bittersweet chocolate to braised duck and hazelnut. The ravioli was not large, but was a little bag of goodness.\n\nMy date had the filet mignon, which was served with a large hunk of russet potato topped with sour cream and truffle. She ordered it well done and it was perfect.\n\nFor dessert, I had the butternut banana cream pie, a tart served in a very fine, filo-like dough, with butterfly wings made of white chocolate flying from the top and a hard dark chocolate ganache on top.\n\nI'm sure the wine list was great, but I'm no wine connoisseur. I picked a reasonably priced bottle of the right general type for the food, and was not disappointed.\n\nThe pictures on the web site are representative of the presentation and portions--beautiful and small. Nevertheless, I did not leave hungry.\n\nI like the place, and would consider going again, but if I were going to spend the same amount of money again in the city, I'd probably try a few more places before returning.", "author": "Kelly J."}

The decor is 1930s SF and the menu is very contemporary.  Possibly the best service I've ever received was here!\n\nI should disclose not that this service and the half a bottle of wine that I had buttered me up quite well for this review...\n\nMy sea bass was tender and salad was crispy and refreshing.  The shrimp on top of the fish were a little surprising to me.  I really didn't think it would work well, but I was wrong.  they were extremely tender, not tough or boring as shrimp can be and they were topped with a green herb.  This green herb, whose name I don't know, was the perfect topping.\n\nI have a couple of suggestions for improvement though.  First, I wouldn't put so many peas on the plate.  I can see the chef's vision to use a fresh green color to pretty-up the plate, but the peas are just not that posh on such an elegant dish.  Also the other greens on the plate were all there for green's sake, not adding a compliment to the fish.  I noticed a different fish dish, which had a variety of carrots prepared differently; so what I think is going on is color themes.  It's ok if not everything on the plate is green, or orange.  The other note I had was for the salad appretizer.  The asparagus was unnecessary and even detrimental to the dish, I think it should've been steamed, salted and needed more acidity.  The dressing had hints of lemon, but the asparagus demanded more.", "author": "Aristocles P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-22", "description": "Boulevard is a staple for business lunches and dinners in the financial district. You won't see groups of young people going there to have a good time, but it's more likely you'll see a room full of middle-aged white collar suits discussing business over a fancy meal, and dropping the corporate card when the check arrives. \n\nThe chef at Boulevard is well known in the Bay (chef Nancy) and has received a handful of awards from what I hear. \n\nNow, on to the food. I've had both lunch and dinner here. The menu changes between both meals...I'd recommend lunch over dinner since I like the items on the daytime menu more (i.e. tuna tartare, crab cakes, lobster bisque, etc). \n\nQuick Highlights/Lowlights:\n\n- Ahi Tuna Tartare: This is excellent. Extremely fresh, probably one of the best tuna tartares I've had. \n- Roman Punterelle Salad with Arugula & Castelfranco: This salad was surprisingly delicious. All ingredients were very fresh and complimented each other well. Small portion. \n- Pan Roasted California Sea Bass: I was warned by the waiter that this fish is a bit different than the typical Sea Bass. I still ordered it, and I'm glad I did. It was cooked very well - golden crust, but soft and moist on the inside. Came with a side of delicious fingerling potatoes that have a butter sauce on the side, and tasty crispy brussel sprouts. \n- German Chocolate Cake Bon Bon: I wanted a small dessert...and this is JUST that. It's like a miniature cake pop, with chocolate on the inside. Although tiny, the bite of chocolate/ice cream/nuts was delicious. \n- Cappuccino: Not sure what kind of coffee beans/espresso they use, but I enjoyed the cappuccino, served with coffee leaf art. \n\nOverall, Boulevard is a nice fidi restaurant with a business-chic ambiance. The food is good, but portions are small and it might dent the wallet a tad. I'd give it 3.5 stars.", "author": "Sabeen c."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-25", "description": "Boulevard is the doppelganger-equivalent (to me, at least) of my beloved No. 9 Park. Its long-lost west-coast twin. A mirror in service, food and atmosphere.\n\nUnlike  No.9 (which I sought out specifically on the advice of my mixologist friend) I stumbled quite by accident upon Boulevard, walking along the water my last night in San Francisco. My tummy was of course grumbling and I had passed nearly a dozen restaurants that surely could have been acceptable.\n\nI was not looking for acceptable, I was looking for something amazing. I was hankering for No. 9...the familiarity, the food, the service and the cocktails. I happened upon a, well, happening place and peered inside. The menu struck a cord that just felt right....Berkshire pork, sweetbreads, shaved summer truffles. But I was wearing jeans and flips...and a gray driving cap embroidered with a giant flower. It looked a bit too fancy for me. But when I saw some out-of-towners (hey - takes one to know one) sauntering in wearing jeans and sneakers, I deemed myself appropriate.\n\nA seat at the bar there was not, but Boulevard's glorious open kitchen features a marble (or granite?) topped counter where you can enjoy your meal. Wait, you mean I can watch them cook and plate all the food from like, a few inches away? SOLD. Sign me up. \n\nThe sommelier was very gracious in suggesting a wine for me after talking to him about what I like. I ended up loving his suggestions...a 2006 Moscato Giallo from Trentino...the aromatics of a spatlese yet bone dry in finish. The by-the-glass list is impressive and diverse as well!\n\nAfter enjoying an amuse of pureed peaches, lobster, cilantro and cauliflower, I moved onto the Sweet Breads and for dinner, the Alaskan King Salmon. Halfway through the sweetbreads the sommelier brings over a taste of a rose from Pink Belly, a wine he makes himself. Perfect for the spices of the dish. At this moment, a very handsome chef leans over and inquires, in a charming french accent, as to how I am enjoying the sweetbreads. With the Salmon, the sommelier kindly brought over a taste of a crisp refreshing Godello. \n\nDessert was the most amazing thing I have ever had. I know that sounds general and sends up some exaggeration flags, but it was really spectacular. Peaches and Butterscotch it was called. A meringue drizzled with butterscotch, a roasted half of a peach, a scoop of peach sorbet, and buttermilk pannacotta. I was going to order a second one (okay, maybe here I am exaggerating) until the waiter comes waltzing over to me with another dessert! \"From us,\" he said, placing in front of me a small dish with a truffle and a mint chocolate bonbon. I don't even know where I put it, but it was delicious.\n\nSitting at the bar, taking notes on my food and experience (I often do this when I dine alone) the waiter offered to give me a copy of the menu to take with me. Not only did he do this, but the sommelier wrote down all of the wine for me that I tried, along with is card, and placed it all in an envelope for me to take along.\n\nThese people really take care of you. \n\nOn some interesting atmosphere notes: The chefs all say hello to you and make conversation with you when you sit at the counter. They laugh and joke with one another on the line (one chef telling another chef to, \"keep it gangster\") and they even let out a few muffled cheers as the chef de cuisine calls \"last fire,\" indicating the last dinner order of the night. They compliment the waitstaff ( i heard one cook tell a server, \"you guys are kicking ass tonight,\") At one point, one of the chefs leans over and asks about my salmon and I reply, \"it's so unusual having the chef ask me about my dinner, \" and she humbly replies, \"I am not the chef, I just cook.\" \n\nIt's a good thing this restaurant does not exist anywhere near where I live, because between this and No. 9, I would go broke!", "author": "Leighann F."}

And yes, I used to be friends with a woman who is a chef there, and had worked at the previous business (L'Avenue)... so I asked our waiter to say hello to her (Pam).

I just wished there was more of it.\n\nOh, and the service was kinda eh, but I think that's more the individual waiter and not the norm.", "author": "Eugene F."}

Trying to keep a good scale where there aren't any super low or super high scores, not everyplace is awesome because then there isn't \"an ok\" place anymore. \nTaste: food was excellent, the porcini mushroom carbonara was fantastic and would have eaten a larger portion for dinner if they had it! The ahi tuna and sea scallops got good reviews from my fellow diners. The lamb t-bone and pork rib chop were both excellent as well.\nService: quite good and attentive, quick with suggestions and background on the dishes. Dishes cleared promptly and wait staff was good about not pushing more wine and drinks as the night wore on.\nAmbiance: was a super busy night so a little tough on table spacing and the place got super loud. Maybe on another night it would have been more bearable. There's definitely some charm there, but could have been poor combination of things that night\nValue: sadly it's quite expensive for all that taste and quality service so rates pretty tough on the value. It's not super expensive, but other places nearby are also quite tasty and a bit cheaper. \nOverall: quite good food and service, would love to go back and could rate the place even higher based on ambiance.

Even though I specifically informed them we were celebrating my wife's birthday, both when making my reservation and after confirming it over the phone, there was not a single acknowledgement about it from either the host or the waitress. When splurging for a special event at a fine dining restaurant, my expectation is to be treated likewise. \n\nRegarding the food, I ordered the lamb and my wife the king salmon. The lamb was very tasty, but the salmon not really special.  The only problem is, the portions are SUPER small! My shellfish salad had an index finger worth of lobster, 1 shrimp, 2 pieces of squid, a donut hole worth of crab and a few pieces of greens. $18.50 My entree had 3 small pieces of lamb, a few vegetables and a pinch of spinach for $36! I thought I mistakenly ordered from the kid's meal! My 5 yr old son could have finished 2 servings! Come on! I do not mind paying for a good meal, but at least put some food on the plate! Even if they doubled the portion, they would still turn a great profit.\n\nWe went at 6pm when it was still light and with the restaurant being quite dark, the mix did not make for great ambiance. While sitting, I was well lit, but my wife was in the shade. It is best to go when the sun has set to appreciate the soft orange glow from the shell shaped light fixtures.\n\nIf your going to spend this kind of money for a good meal, Gary Danko would be a better choice.", "author": "Monkeysign M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-04", "description": "Long ago I had a long distance relationship with this awful guy who lived in San Francisco and all I got from it was a dinner at Boulevard.\n\nLuckily for me Boulevard is so awesome it made the whole tragedy of a relationship worth it.\n\nI kid you not, it was that good.  I mean, I went to a number of restaurants when I would go visit him including that weird vietnamese italian place, some creperie, a tiny little cheese shop, this divey chinese restaurant, and whatever else I stuffed in my face at the Ferry Building.  Boulevard is really the only positive memory I have of the jackass.\n\nI suppose he can thank Chef Nancy Oakes for that because what lingers in my mind now aside from a great location near the Wharf (but then again everything in SF is so close together) and the elegant decor is the heart melting food. In my mind, the food at Boulevard is so special that I'm actually sad that I didn't get to share this wonderful experience with my fiance instead.\n\nThe ex and I went to this restaurant with his charming friends that I lost in the breakup.  We started with the sweet breads and the foie gras.  I think Boulevard really stands out in my mind because it was the first time I ever had the elusive sweet breads.  There are so few places that carry it now and it was so well executed that it feels almost like a figment of my culinary imagination.  The foie gras was also outstanding. \n\nNow I do have to say that Boulevard carries what you would expect from a Nouveau French/American restaurant.  The statutory quail, rack of lamb, and filet make an appearance on the menu and subsequently in my mouth.  Chef Oakes specials change from time to time giving you a deeper look into her creative range.  But even with the standard staples she manages to make something classic new and fresh again with an elegant simplicity with a indescribable brightness that you'd think she was selling happiness one dish at a time. \n\nWe rounded out the meal with some desserts.  As I'm sure you've noticed by the other reviews the portions are small.  This is not in a stingy way, but rather they are perfectly portioned so that you can enjoy each and every course leaving you feeling like a good joke should; wanting more.  Even after a scrumptious dessert trio sent out complementary from the Chef or the manger, I can't remember which one, I felt physically, mentally, and surprisingly emotionally satiated. \n\nAlso of note, the cocktails even reflect this nouveau classic approach.  The blood orange martini was sublime incorporating beautiful color without a sacchariney tacky taste characteristic of most pretty on the outside drinks.  \n\nSo here Boulevard, here's another well deserved 5 stars for achieving what exquisite cuisine is meant to do: raise the spirits, tickle the palate and warm the soul.", "author": "Leah N."}

Ambiance was great for romantic dinner in the back half of the restaurant.  waitress was very attentive.\n\nhere's where we knock off a star.  very busy part of town with scarce parking so you have to valet or park in a garage.  we had made reservations but when we drove by there was no valet attendee in sight on a busy corner, then we drove down the block to the garage which was closed for some reason.  we ended up circling around for at least 20min and so we had to call the restaurant to let them know that we won't make our original time cuz we couldn't find their valet attendee (after at least 3 runs around the block).  they say \"no problem, we'll hold your table for you. the valet should be right there\".  we ended up finding random street parking by a stroke of luck, got to the restaurant (and FINALLY found the valet attendant too late) and then we are told by the girls at the reservation stand that we are too late and they let go of our table - this was not more than 5 minutes after they had JUST told us that they understood our parking issue and would hold it for us.  after giving us a little attitude their excuse was that someone \"upstairs\" handles those phone calls and no one had called to their front stand to notify them.  WTF?!?  so after complaining and getting a word in with a manager, they were finally able to seat us 45 min later for dinner.  look, for a classy place like this that charges quite a bit for their food, you would expect a little better communication between the workers to avoid this kind of confusion instead of just bull$hitting their way around customers.  that said, I'd say that the food quality was great but not for the price (starter, two entrees, 2 sodas with tax & SF city tax & tip came out to $120) so I give 3 stars", "author": "JL G."}

I started with the pear salad. (Good, but it included these mammoth candied walnuts. Unruly to eat in one bite, and impossible to cut.)\n\nFollowed that with the T-bone Lamb. Tasty, but it came with a side of GREEN mashed potatoes! What was that all about? They were cold and tasteless - and very unappealing. The green was just food coloring, it's not like they were wasabi potatoes, just green. What chef in their right mind does that?\n\nCut to dessert, which was deconstructed Rocky Road (again with the big-ass walnuts). Not as tasty as the calories would have you believe.\n\nAnd I was a bit appalled to see our server pumping coffee from an air-pump thermos into a carafe before it was brought to our table.

Our waitress was like the decor, pleasantly understated.\n\nI thought the appetizers were much more appealing than the limited entrees, which were heavy on the fish.  Not in the mood for fish, I asked our waitress for her recommendation.  She suggested the ribs, which to me was just weird that they even had them on such a fine menu.  In the end, my friend had crab cakes and halibut and I had fois gras and sturgeon.\n\nThe fois gras was out of this world ~ probably the best  I've ever had!  My friend loved his halibut.  I liked the sturgeon, but didn't care for how it was served with white beans.  \n\nNonetheless, overall it was a near perfect experience.

Like before I went to Boulevard recently, I was certain that my review was going to begin with these words:  Boulevard is my favorite restaurant in SF.\n\nI have eaten here countless times, although over the last few years not with the frequency that I used to.  It's just so consistent.  A merely great meal would be a shock, the food is always ethereal and the service impeccable.  And of course the d\u00e9cor is architecturally interesting as well as being elegant and timeless.  The room actually has so much positive chi that the amazing view seems ancillary. \n\nOn my most recent trip, the food and service were excellent, but perhaps a bit below the amazingly high standards that Boulevard has set for themselves in my eyes.\n\nStarted with the Foie Gras, first a terrine for the amuse bouche and then seared for the app.  Seared Foie Gras is like sex:  even when it's bad it's good.  But this was good, really good.  A generous portion seared to perfection, with interesting accompaniments.  Can't remember the last time I had foie gras this good.  Didn't hurt that the somewhat sweet Pinot Grigio that the sommelier picked out complimented it very well.\n\nOne person at my table got the lobster bisque, which I guess was a little too fancy to compare to other lobster bisques, but if I were to compare it I would say it was easily the best bisque I have ever tasted.  Phenomenal.\n\nWe also all shared the ravioli appetizer.  I ordered this because at one time a year or two ago they had a ravioli app that was to die for.  As they change the menu I knew that this one was different but based on the last I had to try it.  It was OK.  It was filled with a brie-like cheese that was good but completely overpowering.  The black truffle shavings were surprisingly low on flavor, both in this dish and the chicken entr\u00e9e. \n\nGot the sole.  It was very good.  Came with fried artichokes that were the best thing on the plate.  Tried one way of the chicken four ways.  It was good, but the recipient of the dish said one of the ways was dry.\n\nThe service was great, but a few minor dings that are so subjective I hate to even mention them.  I didn't click with the sommelier.  He seemed a bit snooty, but perhaps I should have expected that.  My dinner companions had some problems with the server, but the service was excellent and she was very friendly so I am going to say she was great and leave it at that.\n\nIt's really the two entrees I tried that are keeping this from being a five star review.

Boulevard's has everything.  From the revolving front door to the bathrooms the interior is beautiful, just classy enough to impress and just quirky enough to avoid being stuffy.  The hosts and waiters are extremely nice, and have gone the extra mile both times I've been there.  The drinks are superb, and the food even better.\n\nLast night I went to Boulevard's with my fianc\u00e9.  We both had salads, she had the Alaskan Halibut and I had the Filet Mignon.  We drank some specialty drinks.  Everything was superb.  As a guy who orders steaks \"medium\" but is used to be ignored by chefs (who seem to be incapable of understanding the idea), I was surprised when my steak came out actually medium.  He listened!  If you prefer your steaks rare, you have no idea how unusual this is.  It was perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, everything I was hoping for.  The sides and presentation were also outstanding.   Our waiter - I wish I got his name - was the best waiter I've had in ages.  Attentive, interested, not over-bearing.  He neither rushed us nor left us waiting.  Plus, he brought us some tasters between our salads and meal, and who doesn't like tasters?  \n\nThe desert deserves special note.  Boulevard's has a pastry chef doing just the deserts, and it shows.  Instead of just slapping some raspberry on some chocolate like so many fancy restaurants do, the pastry chef is clearly going out of her way to try new things.  I'm not the type to use words like \"daring\" when it comes to food (I swear), but it's the best word here.  Our deserts both incorporated different flavors and textures wonderfully, and  both were great!  \n\nTo top it off, our bill was 50 bucks less than we guessed it would be!

I go to plenty of restaurants that charge you $11 for a Greygoose cran with no Greygoose in it. My one complaint are the ridiculously small tables they have. I feel like if I move the wrong way I will tip over everything on my table. I don't like feeling like a giant.", "author": "Taj P."}

It's a favorite of one of the partners, who has been coming here for years. The service, wine, pace of the meal, and the meal itself were all flawless. \n\nI will leave it to other reviews to delve into details of the dishes I wouldn't have eaten (seems the French know their meats). But I will discuss one thing: beets. Yes, beets! My prior experience with beets: those gross staining red ones in greek salads, and Jitterbug Perfume (Tom Robbins). Yet imagine my surprise to see they're on the menu of one of the nicest restaurants in San Francisco. These little beets come out, yellow and red, with some kick-ass Humboldt's Fog.

We talked loud and enjoyed one another's company.  No dirty looks from our waitstaff or neighboring customers.  The mood was lively.  \n\nThe main entree, for me (sea bass), was less amazing than the round of delicately prepared appetizers.  It fell a little short, tasting more like most bistro entrees. \n\nThen the chocolate cake finished the meal in a grand slam (bringing the entree experience safely home).

I dig the revolving door and all the arches and baubles around. \n\nBut yeah get to the food right?  We got our menus, and they said the menu is always changing.  The food was obviously autumnal, as it should be.  We got some appetizers for the table.  The foie gras with autumn fruits was wonderful.  I haven't had a grilled foie gras like this, and it's different than seared, and I found the flavor was more rich and pronounced this way.  The accoutrements were great too, and leaned more towards the sweet.  Beef carpaccio was superb...wish I had had more, it was refreshing and clean tasting.  The ahi tartare was nice as well.  All were overshadowed by the crab salad though...dungeness meat with a bunch of other stuff and dangit I could have eaten like two metric tons of the stuff.  Nothing, and I mean nothing did not fit with this dish, and it was so balanced and sweet and savory and perfect that I didn't want to stop eating it.  This is a must-have!!!\n\nEntr\u00e9e-wise we didn't share as much.  I had the duck done two ways.  It was a breast and a leg, both wonderfully meaty and savory, medium-rare.  It came with huckleberry relish (fruit and duck is so good together, and the tangy berries really cut the richness well)  shaved brussels sprouts with pecans (seasonal and reminiscent of thanksgiving.  Not enough brussels sprouts on menus and I loved them. Under-appreciated veggies they are)  and butterball potatoes.  Gone in seconds and a tasteful, seasonal way to present the duck.\n\nDessert was just as good.  We got some cheese---a wonderful crumbly blue and some brie-like stuff, and I got a rocky road sundae.  This sundae...adventuresome presentation.  Nearly like a deconstructive presentation here.  Chocolate ice cream, candied walnuts (aren't they almonds in the ice cream though?  oh well not complaining) meringues (!!! oh yeah!!!) and homemade marshmallows.  Everyone at the table said it looked like a little town.  Indeed it did.  I played the part of Godzilla faithfully then!! :)\n\nSan Francisco, you never fail me when it comes to food.

ALL were delicious, my mom said the halibut was the BEST she's ever had. The presentation is nice and everyone working there was very nice and accomodating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-14", "description": "This restaurant came very highly recommended from a good friend, so we decided to try it for Valentine's Day and it did not disappoint.  (We tried to make reservations for 2/14 back in January and they were entirely booked so we instead reserved for 2/13).\n\nI ordered the roasted mariquita farm golden beets and the organic free range chicken with truffles prepared 4 ways.  \n\nI really love beet salad and this salad was delicious, generally beet salad is always served with mixed greens, candied walnuts, vinagrette and goat cheese, Boulevard instead paired the roasted beets with mixed herbs, truffles and this really delicious fresh buffalo mozarella.  It was a slightly different take on the way everyone else does it, I ate every bit of it.\n\nIn regards to the chicken dish, you can tell they spend a lot of care and preparations with the 4 different ways, my favorites were the confit chicken wing and crispy roulade.  It was served with israeli couscous which I didn't care for, I ate one bite and left the rest.  Only complaint is that this dish was slightly oversalted.  Note: The dish had so much meat that I was only able to eat about 40% of it.\n\n***Now inserting random thought - while we were leisurely enjoying our meal we looked up at the ceilings at the slightly domed sections covered in brick.  It is a very interesting treatment which raised many questions in our minds...Are they real brick?  Are they faux foam brick?  How are the bricks attached to the ceiling?  Has a brick ever come loose and hit someone upside the head and killed them dead on the spot....?***\n\nOn to my husband's food...He ordered the ahi tuna tartare and the roasted pork chop.  The ahi tuna tartare was probably the best dish of the night, they served it with mushroom tempura which was sooo good - light, crispy, flavorful, perfect texture.  I wanted more of this dish for sure.  The pork chop was served with brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, apple, and bacon.  Flavor wise, I'd say the pork was better than the chicken, although the chicken was more a interesting dish.\n\nFor dessert we had the sorbet - pineapple and raspberry lychee, very light, flavorful, and yummy!  Not too sweet.  It also came with a rosemary sugar cookie, of which we were both too full to finish.\n\nAll in all, I would eat here again on a special occasion, next time I would probably order a larger assortment of the starters and dessert and skip the main entrees.  Would also be good if they carried at least 1 vegetarian main entree.\n\nNote:  I removed 1 star because my husband asked the waitress for a wine pairing recommendation for his pork chop, the waitress easily/quickly recommended the Scherrer Pinot Noir which my husband enjoyed thoroughly.  However, when we got the bill, 1 glass was $17.50, I found it surprising that she recommended one of the most expensive items out of the list of reds without any hint at the price!  A little nit picky on my part, I know...If she mentioned that it was pricey but delicious and worth it, we probably still would have picked it, but it would have made me feel better that she was looking out for us.", "author": "Burrito M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2006-07-25", "description": "Big disappointment. Huge.  I had ridiculously high expectations for renown Boulevard.  I had wanted to try it since moving to the City six months ago. I enviously eyed diners entering the door from my apartment window. What a waste or money, expectation and time!\n\nThe dining room is beautiful.  Well-appointed, clean. The ambiance is boisterous, but not overly noisy.  I was encouraged when, upon being seated, I ordered and was presented with a beautiful Lemon Drop Martini.  Elegant large, clear sugar crystals decorated the rim and the Martini was delicious. Ditto for the massive mojito that my boyfriend was served.  It ends here.\n\nThere were four in our party so we began with two appetizers:  the ahi tar tar( $16) and the abalone ($20- the evening's special) . Ahi was BLAND!  I like my ahi with a little heat, and compared to the spicy ahi/salmon mix at Cosmopolitan, this really disappointed. The other problem was that they served this heaping mound of ahi with a pixie-sized serving of homemade potato chips. POTATO CHIPS. At Cosmo, the mix is served with delectable Nobi crackers baked with flecks of seaweed. Oh, and the superior Cosmo version is only $11. The Abalone was also bland.  So much batter that the flavor of the delicacy was lost.  Also, two very teeny pieces of abalone. Two members of our party had the goat cheese salad. Nothing special at all. \n\nEntrees\nTwo had the sea bass. It was obvious that the sea bass had been frozen (ludicrous when you're charging $35 for the dish), and one order was particularly veiny and tough.  It was also served with a really gummy risotto that had ham in it. \n\nI had the duck. Duck was good, with much of the fat trimmed, cooked medium-rare. I will say that the duck was a high-light, but again, at almost $40 for the entree, I had hoped for something awe-inspiring.  I'd say the quality was equivalent to the duck dish at One Market for almost twice the price. \n\nOne diner had the scallops. Two. TWO SCALLOPS. FOR THIRTY FREAKING DOLLARS. TWO!!!!!!!\n\nDessert\n\nEXCELLENT !!!! Creme brulet lemon cheesecake was to die for. Coffee was good too.  They should hand the kitchen over to the pastry chef!!!\n\nService\n\nNot particularly friendly or attentive. Nothing to write home about.\n\nBottom Line\n\nIf entrees were about $10 or so less per person, I would have given Boulevard 3, maybe 3.5 stars. It's in a great location and some of the dishes are tasty.  But when a restaurant is going to charge extremely high prices, I expect nothing but the best. Either Blvd is resting on its laurels, or the majority of patrons haven't explored the vast expanse that is San Francisco cuisine.

We both had the same thing: the crab salad and sea bass recommend by the waiter.  The creme fresh sauce on the crab salad seemed a bit mayo-esque and was not pleasant to me, although the crab and avocado was good.  My mom liked the salad but I was skeptical. And the fish main was simply over-cooked for both of us.  The bass was a dry as a rock and we were surprised and disappointed.  After we ate, we informed our waiter and he was nice enough to give a free desert, but it didn't make up for over-cooked fish.  I'd be more tolerant, except at these prices, you expect that they wouldn't serve a dry piece of bass that a mid-westerner like my mother wouldn't eat.  \n\nAlso, we would have never gone for the bass in the first place if it wasn't highly recommended by the waiter.  \n\nGo figure, my wife's lamb was fantastic.  So it was uneven, and if we had all ordered the lamb this would be an excellent review.  But I'd recommend that you complain on your first bite if you don't like what you get.  I felt ripped off but didn't want to make a fuss during a nice occasion with my mom and my wife.

I had a bleau cheese plate. A little rich for my taste, but adequate.

I didn't feel like wine or any alcohol that night because I got super wasted the night before, so I got a coke.

No, probably not. Expensive for what the outcome was for us. Out total was about $150 with no tip, 2 people.", "author": "K H."}

No way could it be worth that, I thought to myself. I would've paid $18. It was fantastic. The rest of the meal was very much the same, although it's true what they say about the small portions.

Definitely a destination restaurant and a LOT of money has gone into just making this place look fantastic.  The interior is stunning, very Paris Metro-like in it's exposed brick arches, organically shaped lamps and stained glass bar.  The visual pop is stunning as it is.\n\nThen you get the menu...\n\nWonderfully unique combinations of flavors and ingredients were featured including many items not commonly found on your typical menu, even at a nice place like this.  The calamari to start was delicious and cut with a fork soft.  The mountain char for the main course was also very tasty, presented on a bed of rice with wild broccoli on top.  The dessert I enjoyed was a rhubarb crisp topped with buttermilk ice cream, it was nothing short of amazing.  The food was all top notch, gorgeously presented and not too filling, worth the hefty cost of admission.  \n\nThe service was very good as well, with glasses being regularly refilled with water, well timed questioning of whether everything was to our liking, and good advice when we were choosing our meals.\n\nAt $60 a head (with tax and tip, but no wine) was not cheap, but definitely one of the best dining experiences I have had in SF.  The only real complaint I had was that the benches in our booth were so close together that the person sitting across from me kept accidentally kicking my feet, and I did the same.\n\nOtherwise, if you're up for the tab, it's worth it.", "author": "Eric M."}

Kinda transcends words, eh?\n\nIn terms of dining experiences, I would look to comfort and ambiance, quality of service (attentiveness, friendliness, helpfulness), quality and creativity of food, and price.\n\nWith these criteria in mind, I'm going on record in saying that Boulevard is the best restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nTo be sure, on the last item (pricing), Boulevard is expensive. At first, I didn't even see the prices for the entres because they're printed so small and butted up against the descriptive prose. But, I know this going in, and so decided that price wasn't an issue (my good friend the credit card helped me out on that one).\n\nBut from the moment we walked in, we were treated like we were special (we are, dammit!). My lady started off with a daquiri, and I a champagne. The complimentary bread was ordinary, but somehow made extraordinary (surroundings, psyche).\n\nWe went with the special appetizer of the day, tempura garlic scapes with thinly sliced bits of summer squash, and oh my GOD. Yeah, whatever ... can't really write about how amazing they were.\n\nShe got Angus short ribs, I Angus filet mignon. When ordering our wine, I had a bottle picked out, and ran it by our server after placing the main course orders. She complimented me on the selection but offered one other from the same region of France, pointing out that the main difference might be the vintage. We went with my choice, but she wasn't offended. Not at all.\n\nOkay, seriously, all I can say about the filet mignon is ... well, it was one of the top 5 things I've ever eaten. Covered in a Bearnaise sauce (according to Wikipedia: made of clarified butter and egg yolks flavored with tarragon and shallots, with chervil and tarragon simmered in vinegar), it practically melted in my mouth, and kept my taste buds entertained like never before. WOW.\n\nI chose the Meyer lemon brioche pudding, a more firm bread pudding than most, and it was perfect. Yes, I'm serious.\n\nBoulevard was part of our Special Dinners list.

My brother and I both got the filet mignon which for 50 bucks we were ready to be amazed. I have had better at Tahoe Joe's. We both gave it a C-, it had a really off flavor and was rather mediocre. I asked to see the manager about the Tartar, and I explained it was pretty tasteless and not fresh, he was rather nonchalant about the whole thing but we later found out he took them off our bill.

We dined here Monday night to celebrate Mr. C's newfound employment, and it tickles me to no end that Boulevard is just as good as ever.\r\n\r\nThe service has gotten a little more sniffy, the clientele noticeably more swank, and the prices (never a bargain to begin with) have climbed proportionally. But the Beaux Arts decor is still gorgeous, the wine list is still deep without being impenetrable, and -- most importantly -- the food's still creative without being too far out in left field.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple of missteps in our recent dinner -- a desperately over-dressed salad, a server who left us sitting without water or drinks or so much as an \"I'll be right with you\" for nearly 15 minutes, an awkward gap between the appetizers and the mains -- but all was forgiven when our entrees arrived. \r\n\r\nMy heirloom pork chop was easily the best pig I have eaten in the states, perfectly cooked and richly porky with a perfectly salty, herbal flavor. And the accompanying pyramid-shaped raviolo was like a minature meal in itself: mascarpone mashed potatoes on the bottom, with shredded wild boar ragu in the top. Yum!\r\n\r\nIt's nice when old standbys age well.

None of it did anything to enhance the flavor. I believe all items on a plate should work together and they didn't.\n\nFor dessert, our table shared the apple tartin and the ice cream sandwiches. Here the dinner again had an upswing since the ice cream sandwiches were absolutely delicious, especially the sandwich made with merengue that melts in your mouth. The apple tartin was just okay since its not what one would expect. (It was deconstructed so that the apple was separate from the crust.) \n\nOverall, there are plenty expensive restaurants in the city and if I am splurging on dinner again, I'll opt elsewhere.", "author": "eileen b."}

I was really looking forward to dining at this restaurant after reading some reviews.  Maybe my expectations were set too high before I arrived, but I can't say this was as great as I thought it would be.\n\nFor starters, my mom and I split the sweetbreads.  The portion was quite small, but very tasty.  The bacon was crisp and maybe a little overpowering.  My dad had the foie gras with quince bread which was very good.  An interesting combination that definitely worked.\n\nFor entrees my mom had the sea bass with risotto.  The risotto was delicious -- probably the best thing on the dish since in my mom's words, \"The fish is just fish.\"  I guess nothing special.  My dad ordered the suckling pig three ways, of which one was very good and the other two were just okay.  I had the filet - nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nFor dessert, my mom had the apple terrine and my dad had this chocolate cake that they both enjoyed immensely.  I, on the other hand, had ordered the sticky toffee pudding.  It wasn't what I was expecting and I didn't really enjoy it.  I chalked it up to bad ordering.  My mom embarrisingly mentioned (not complained) to the waiter that I unfortunately did not like my dessert.  He said I could not leave the restaurant without enjoying dessert and brought me my second-choice of the huckleberry buckle.  Boy, that was good! I was sure happy to have been able to switch out desserts like that.  Pretty amazing service if you ask me!\n\nOverall the food was good.  There were some very nice highlights to each meal, but the experience didn't leave me with an overwhelming desire to come back -- especially for th price.  3 stars for food, +1 for excellent service.", "author": "Katie M."}

I had the Escolar as my main - probably the best fish dish I have ever eaten in SF - and that says quite a bit.  Me love fish.  I had the bittersweet chocolate cake for dessert.  It was tasty - very rich, but hard to finish - and I absolutely love anything chocolate and decadent, so you might want to share that one.  \n\nOnly slight problem is that we got there at the rush, and it seemed that the entrees and desserts took an unusual amount of time to surface.

I ordered the crab salad appetizer as my entree and it was extremely tasty.  Portions are small considering the price ($17.50 for the appetizer), but it is located near the Embarcadero, so it was not such a shock to me.  Everyone else raved about their dishes.  And we all split a couple desserts, the chocolate sampler was delicious, and the peach dessert was good as well.\n\nSo I took off a star because of the hostess.  I did walk in the door with a backpack on, but I work at a software company so I lug a lap top to BART and around town. But besides that I was dressed appropriately. When I walked in, the hostess looked at me with a blank expression and the guy behind her asked me if he could help me. I told them the name the reservation was under, she looked at her list, said she didn't see the name and continued to look blankly at me.  My party was already there, and when I told her so, she raised an eyebrow at me. I swear I don't look totally weird, or at least not so horrible to deserve  the look she was giving me. So I decided it would be best not to wait around for her to think of something to say and I headed to the table.\n\nTo be fair, the rest of the staff was very attentive and non-awkward.

For a quieter, more intimate dinner, I recommend reserving/requesting a table at the back of the restaurant (close to Embarcadero and the bridge/bay).  I haven't sat elsewhere in the restaurant so I haven't experienced any of the loudness people seem to complain about.  When I made reservations the first time I came here, we asked about the noise and they recommended where to sit for it to be quieter ... so they're definitely willing to shift things around to accommodate when possible.\n\nFood was incredible.  I think I sampled off all 6 other people's plates, and devoured my own - appetizers, entrees and desserts were all incredibly delicious.  My personal favorites were the filet and the scallops.\n\nDefinitely pricey, but worth it for a very special occasion.

Satisfied, but not floored. So given that slightly jaded outlook, take my review with a grain of salt.\n\nI really, really liked it. Wonderful company, good service, a lovely space and view, good libations and food. Didn't love it though.\n\nThere are many good things to say about the food, but it wasn't perfect:\nSquab appetizer: the squab was wonderful but the tortellini were too heavy, dense and cold.\nSweetbreads were great, but again, the side of lobster-stuffed onion was unbalanced in flavor. A couple of really outstanding items like the Seared Foie Gras with Breakfast Tea foam and the Abalone.\n\nOne of my friends had Halibut, which was delicious, but I had to send my Sea Bass back because it was overcooked. I received a replacement in less than two minutes (sorry for whoever lost his plate there....) and it was perfectly cooked, so no harm done. Aside from that, the dish was well made, but not really exciting: fish, butter, three kinds of peas and e voila! Although I can appreciate the philosophy of using fresh in season ingredients and letting them speak for themselves, so no big complaints there.\n\nI'm not a big dessert person, unless you give me chocolate, but I went out on a limn and ordered brioche custard with sorbet. And here's a cheer to all them folks that say go out of your comfort zone: you're right. That was dessert heaven, totally orgasmic. I may never eat chocolate again.

This really is a great restaurant and deserves the attention it receives.  However, the hype and cost set the bar really high.\n\nThe foie gras comes on a pumpkin cake, which is a unique blend of flavors.  They seem to work together, but it left me itching for more.  Other times I have had foie gras, it has been extremely rich.  This time, it was not as heavily flavored as I would have liked.\n\nFor some reason, I decided to try the filet mignon as it seemed popular.  The filet was executed well and had great flavor.  Bad timing or poor kitchen work deducted from this whole plate as everything tasted as if it had been sitting for 10 minutes.  My food was literally luke warm.  \n\nI did get a chance to sample some of the quail/beef plate and the cod.  The cod was probably the best with respect to blending of flavors and execution.  \n\nA fellow diner had the pork prime rib and they were very satisfied.  It looked very appetizing and I have thoughts of returning just to sample.\n\nIf you find yourself limited with vegetarian options, they do make an all vegetarian side dish platter for $25 which is not on the menu.  \n\n\nFinally, dessert ended up being a cheese plate for me.  This was probably the highlight of my meal.  A very fresh and balanced platter of items accompanied my cheese.  The ice cream sandwiches plate looked really appetizing and all of my fellow diners loved it.\n\nAs far as ambiance goes, this place is decorated well and lighting is friendly.\n\nBottom line:  The place does deserve the raves it gets, but expect to pay for it and don't set your bar too high.", "author": "Simon Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-25", "description": "See profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\n\nAfter an early breakfast at Tartine and plenty of time driving around viewing the city, the Golden Gate Bridge, and the Academy of Sciences the goal was a visit to California's oldest restaurant for some lunch around 2:00 - little did we know that President's day is actually a day off for those at Tadich Grill and most of downtown.  A little disappointed I fired up the GPS to figure out something close and low-and-behold was greeted by another Northern California landmark - Boulevard.  Having read glowing revies of Nancy Oakes both as a chef and a person, I'd actually considered dinner at Boulevard for that evening, but why wait, especially given the number of restaurants closed in SF on Mondays!\n\nArriving at Boulevard around 2:05 the restaurant was still approximately half full but our lack of reservations was not an issue at all.  A courteous valet took the car and led us through the doors into the marvelous stone-clad room with its beautifully wide open kitchen and prep area, long scenic bar, and smells that piqued both my interest and my appetite. \n\nAfter approximately 3 minutes we were seated and our wonderfully helpful (if not a bit pretentious) waiter, Joe W presented us with menus and suggestions for wine - an option we declined, instead opting for iced tea and water.  By the time Joe's assistant returned with water and tea our minds were made up, orders were placed, and I made a quick trip (down the stairs, where many old awards hang) to the restroom where, oddly, a picture of a nude lady hangs.  By the time I returned, a wonderful block of superb sourdough with wonderful salted butter was present and I proceeded to overindulge without regret.\n\nFor our meal options, my mother selected a main while my aunt chose an appetizer and a main and I selected two appetizers to serve as my main.  Course one of the meal consisted of my aunt's Dungeness Crab Cake with Bouillabaisse and Saffron Aioli and my eared Monterey Calamari with Pan Seared Artichoke Hearts and Puree, crispy tentacles, olive-red pepper relish.  Both dishes were presented nicely by Joe and described in great detail with the bouillabaisse actually added to the crabcake tableside - a nice touch.  Incredibly fresh and decent in portion, both dishes were true palate pleasers and on par with what one would expect in a place like Boulevard.  Though she was first hesitant about the crab because she worried the bouillabaisse would be too fishy, my aunt loved her dish and while I generally prefer a little less spice in my dish, the pepper with my calamari was actually quite subdued by the olive and the crispy tentacles provided and interesting contrast to the smooth cephalopods. \n\nFor our mains, my mother selected the Organic Free Range Chicken Breast with Black Truffles, Baked Crespelle with Wild Mushroom Ragu, Ricotta, Sauteed Broccoli di Ciccio and Rich Chicken Jus while my aunt opted for the Kobe Beef Burger on Brioche Bun with White Cheddar, Crispy Fries, and Condiments.  As I do not eat beef I cannot comment on the burger, but my aunt claims it was the best burger she has ever tasted and stated she didn't even need to chew as the buttery brioche and beef melted on her tongue.  In reference to the fries, I can say that these were a stunning example of how to make a potato, though not on par with those of Michael Mina or Thomas Keller, quite better than Michael Symon's at Lola.  \n\nWith regard to the chicken, let's just say that if I had the money to purchase free-range local birds every day at home I'd be a much happier man and if all Broccoli tasted like this I wouldn't have so many patients telling me they did not like salad.  Without overstating I can say this was the best piece of foul I'd ever had (better than Trotters or Ducasse) until my subsequent meal at The French Laundry and I would strongly recommend the crispy coated yet perfectly moist bird to anyone who truly appreciates fine cooking technique and wonderful quality ingredients.  The truffles in this dish, like in the chicken at Le Cirque were mostly for show.\n\nFor my main, I allowed my love of eggs to be indulged and selected the Slow Cooked Organic Farm Egg with Soft Polenta and Roasted Garlic, Quercia Acorn Prosciutto and Shaved Himalayan Truffles.  Ham, eggs, garlic, and mushrooms simply never tasted so good - like the best savory breakfast you can imagine.  Perfectly poached, the egg's rich and smooth yolk contrasted sharply with the salty ham while the textured polenta and heavy hints of garlic were brought into focus by a surprisingly fresh and large portion (for the price) of Truffles.  While I'm not the sort who praises truffles simply because they are rare or pricey, their effect on eggs is something I truly love and this dish was no exception.\n\nSomewhat full, yet well informed that dessert at Boulevard should not be missed each of us selected an option with each being a winner -", "author": "Michael U."}

Mix as you please.\n\nMiso Black Cod & Lobster bisque: the cod and roll are brought out in a deep dish, and the waiter adds the bisque at your table. While the shrimp roll was good, the cod had lousy texture, and the entire dish was a touch too salty.\n\nMonterey Red Abalone: there was more focus on the abalone MUSHROOM than the abalone itself. You get what I can only describe as two flakes of abalone. The herb soubise was reminiscent of simple pesto. Abalone is fantastic; the taste shouldn't be hidden!\n\nAs an entree, the Petrale Sole: presentation and flavor were all present, but the sole was not roasted enough. Some fish are fine seared, but not sole. We ended up leaving the inner \"chunk.\"\n\nI unwisely went against the waiter's recommendation for wine, and went for a glass of grenache. Bleh. Open too long before poured, and too heavy on licorice flavors for my taste.\n\nThe desserts were more redeeming:\nThe Butterscotch Cream Pie was light and delish save for a too-hard crust.\n\nThe Chocolate Fudge Cake was amazing. They don't give it enough credit on their menu. For those of you who like molten lava cakes, this is the sh*t. Have it.

Well, I basically grew up on Creme Caramel and since both cremes have the same custard base - i could tell right away that the creme served at the Bouleverd has had the egg yolks beaten by a machine - too smooth, too even - still excellent though. When you beat the egg yolks by hand - air bubbles form in the cream and it feels a bit more firm. It's the imperfections that sometimes make things unforgettable. \n\nFrench martini was okay, well, giving the fact that we were originally headed for Chaya and almost got there but, voila, they Did Not Know How To Make Me a French Martini, that French fusion place. A restaurant has got to have good bartenders, otherwise we immediately move next door. \n\nSo, at Boulevard, we got bar seats and that was fine but for the large plates and food sharing that ensued. Ahi Tartare was okay, stuffed squid was good, salmon was okay, halibut seemed better, especially being dressed with zingy sour tomatoes and white beans. I am not sure about pairing risotto with Salmon - risotto seems to get a bit mushy under fish and. .. The Main thing that distinguishes first class cuisine from just a plain good'ol restaurant is the fact that in the good places you never think about salt. You never need to season anything on your plate because it has already been taken care of. On the other hand, Salmon at Boulevard needed rocks of salt to get it to a good place. Well, food up to creme brulee - 2 stars. creme brulee - 3, almost 4 if it had been with hand beaten yolks. Good night.", "author": "Dimmer L."}

We had reservations for 7, but were sat at 7.30. When you walk in, you notice right away how large the venue is, so noise was immediately a factor. Don't expect a quiet little dinner for two. Its like a large, super posh cafe, but doesn't feel like a \"fine dining\" experience.\n\nIt took a while for the waiter to notice that we were there, so water and menus came quite late. After that however, our server was spot on. His timing was impeccable (never interrupting our conversation) and his attention to detail was great. \n\nThe crabcake salad was good, but it lacked the type of zest you'd expect from a supposed 5 star restaurant. My salmon was overcooked, as was the risotto that went with it. My wife's halibut was undercooked and also lacked any real flavor. The food didn't \neven look pretty. The Vanilla Brulee was good, but seemed a bit to thin for that type of dessert. \n\nAll together it was quite a let down to eat here. This review may seem somewhat pretentious, but when you are shelling out over $200 for dinner for two, I feel like it should blow you away. To be truly 5 star, you need to have the right feel and mood setting, excellent inventive dishes, and top notch service. Once you have all of that, you need to also be able to do it consistently, every night. Boulevard misses the mark by not giving you the value that you'd expect for the premium price tag. \n\nThis was my first and last visit.", "author": "D L."}

We had a fabulous table at the large back windows looking out onto the sunny Embarcadero.\nWithout fail, I have had crispy squash blossoms every time I've dined here, and this was no exception. In fact, this may have been the best preparation I've ever had - here or otherwise! We shared 2 orders, which they thoughtfully plated on one plate to save room (there was a lot of glassware on the table). 4 crispy squash blossoms, fried absolutely perfectly without a hint of grease, were stuffed with a creamy rock shrimp mixture. A saute of fresh corn and bacon was beneath the blossoms, and the whole thing was drizzled with a smoky tasso aioli. SO delicious!\nI then ordered the tuna nicoise salad as my entree. A huge hunk of albacore tuna was perched atop a summer bean salad of yellow wax, cranberry, and green beans. The tuna and beans did need a little seasoning but fortunately the salt was left on the table. There were also some chopped heirloom tomatoes that were slathered in a yellow tomato aioli, which I immediately asked for more of because it was very tasty. I wish I'd had some fries to sop it all up! Half of a perfectly soft-boiled egg was also on the side. I spread the egg on my bread, yum! The sea bass and the filet entrees both looked very good, but the guys didn't feel like sharing :( I was able to try a bit of the chicken salad entree, which was also really tasty. Instead of a mayonnaise-drenched mush of chicken and apples, the presentation took an innovative approach: a roasted chicken leg and some grapes and apple slices were served with a wedge of iceberg and dressing on the side for you to basically make your own lettuce cups. I thought it was a very clever presentation and one that I might attempt to recreate. Somehow we'd left room for cheese (there's always room for cheese!) and picked 2 off the artisan selection. The St. Nectaire and Bayley Hazen blue were presented on a long platter as 2 crossed triangles, and accompanied by some honeycomb and roasted, salted almonds.\nThe service was mostly good throughout the meal (with a couple exceptions of waiting on plates to be cleared) but really fell apart at the end. Did we really need to wait 10 minutes *after* the cheese plate to be asked again if we were ready for the espresso? Just bring it! We need to get out of here - it's 3:15 pm!!! It also seemed exceptionally loud that day, not sure why. Other than that though, I was once again pleased with this classic, classy place.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-04", "description": "I discovered Boulevard while I was researching James Beard Nominated restaurants.  Not only was it nominated but I read many great reviews.  This place is quite popular, we weren't able to get a reservation before 10 pm.  Boulevard is dressy but not formal.  The kitchen is open concept, so you can watch the chefs make your meal right in front of you.  We had just gone on a wine tour so weren't really interested in alcohol.  I applaud them for having a non alcoholic drink menu.  We had their peach and strawberry lemonade and it was refreshing without being too tart.  For our mains, I had the CALIFORNIA SQUAB &TOLENAS FARMS QUAIL PAN ROASTED WITH GARLIC & THYME with Wild Rice & Farro with Seared Foie Gras & Caramelized Shallots Knoll Farm Brown Turkey Fig with a Salad of Red Walnuts, Dry Mission Fig & Pink Pearl Apples Roasted Squab Jus for $33.50.  It is hard when you have a duo because you are always going to like one better than the other.  I have never tried squab, and i liked it better than the quail.  It had a nice crust and was still slightly pink.  The figs were a nice accompaniment to the meat.  My sis had the LAMB T-BONE, WOOD OVEN ROASTED ON THE BONE WITH ROSEMARY, THYME, MINT & GARLIC SERVED OFF THE BONE with buttered greens, and potato stuffed zucchini flower for $34.  The lamb was juicy and cooked perfectly.  She loved the slight bitterness of the buttery greens which worked so well with the lamb.  It was a  well thought out dish.\nIf we just had our entr\u00e9es, i would have given BLVD a 5.  However it took forever for our plates to get cleared off our table.  We also waited at least ten minutes to get a dessert menu.  Usually in a fine dining restaurant, everything is so well timed, it wasn't here.  \nWe had watched the pastry chef push out beautiful desserts all night but we opted for a cheese plate instead.  Each cheese you select is $7 and it is served with \"SEASONAL FRUIT and OLIVE OIL ROASTED ALMONDS & BAGUETTE\".  We chose a blue and a goats cheese.  Not joking it came with a rock hard baguette that was slightly scored into four slices,and a handful of almonds.  Now for the Seasonal Fruit, 1 cherry cut in half, 1 date cute in half, 1/2 teaspoon of honeycomb, and a little bit of lemon marmalade.  We went in the middle of summer when there was a bounty of fresh fruit and we were served this pittance.  It looked pretty, but the food costs was probably $2.  Overall the food was great but the service and the dessert totally brought the meal down.", "author": "Amy D."}

My friends told me this probably the worst service they had to date but in no way was it bad. Which has to say that service here normally is top notch.\n\nSome notable moments of the serivce were when we pulled out a bottle of wine we had brought with us a nice Cabernet I beleieve that deserves a fully bodied wine glass was provided without even asking.  The waiter remove the standard house wine glasses in favor for some the perfect glass to enjoy some fine vino. \n\nWE then looked through the menu and picked out soem appetizer before our meal We went with some scalops that were seared to perfection and melted in your mouth.

Top Notch pastry chefs at The Boulevard.\n\nMy only REAL gribe is after having a fine meal sometime you need to use the restroom. The Boulevard is an upscale eatery that has been in San Francisco for some time but to use the bathroom at The Boulevard you have to leave the restraunt go down the stairs or the elevator of the same building and then enter a note so nice bathroom that does not equal the tasty treats upstairs.  I am unsure if the restraunt takes care of the bathroom or if it is shared with other units as it was so so on the upscale feeel of the rest.

I mean, yeah, sure you can just stroll right in and hope to get a table.

I waited to review, to ensure consistancy vs responding to the JB award hype of last summer. I am hear to say, this place is rock solid dining! The best place to sit, if there are just 2 of you, is at the Chefs bar. I love watching them work & seeing all the tasty meals going out to the floor. The appetizers are fantastic & the entrees, although steep, are of great quality & presentation. The service was outstanding too. Always well-paced and aware of when our group of 6 needed anything. My only 'complaint' is the upcharging of the wine list prices. Its absurd here. Its very common very restaurants to upcharge a bottle you can buy on the shelf by $20-$30 but I saw bottles that were doubled! My recommendation? Bring a bottle or Magnum yourself & pay the corkage fee. Otherwise, great place to bring friends or family while visiting SF.

I discovered it was located right on the water with a view. I immediately became concerned that it would be just like all of the other restaurants \"with a view\" and have mostly tourists and overpriced-mediocre food. As it was a beautiful night and we wanted to see the Bay Bridge lights anyway, we decided to give it a shot - boy were we glad we did! The restaurant is  beautiful old world french decor. It is spacious with a stunning view in the back of the restaurant of the bay bridge. Mostly large groups back there, but there are a few tables for 2 further back in the restaurant that have a view. The space and feel is elegant without being stuffy - the perfect place for a date. We started out with a few cocktails which were good, but not mind blowing. For food I started with the dungeness crab. It was incredible. The crab melted in your mouth and the flavors worked so well together. For my entree I had the grilled swordfish. The portion is huge! It was grilled to perfection. The citrus flavors from the meyer lemon really came through. The risotto was also delicious, a nice balance to the rest of the dish. Service the entire time was friendly but unobtrusive. I really had a great experience here and was pleasantly surprised that a restaurant with this great of a view and atmosphere can deliver on all levels with their food. It is alittle pricey, but worth it- especially for a special occasion. Also, the building has a bit of history which is really interesting. If you are into that sort of thing, check it out for sure.", "author": "Joseph F."}

I was afraid that this would be another long-standing SF restaurant just resting on its laurels (like Aqua--yeech!), but how wrong I was.

In this world of super-sized meals, I was so happy to actually finish a meal and not feel like I was about to explode (or have to take home a doggie bag consisting of some sad-assed 1/8th-sized plate portion which I'll just end up throwing out in a week).  I felt completely satisfied at the end of the meal.\n\nFor appetizers we had the special abalone appetizer and the beet salad.  For entrees we ate the butterfish with stuffed, grilled calamari.  I'd never had butterfish before, and I'm regretting every moment I've lived not knowing about this fish.  Wonderful, sweet texture and taste.\nFor dessert we split the angel food cake served with sliced nectarines and diced peaches, accompanied by a wonderful ginger ice cream and I believe a nectarine sorbet.

My two companions and I each had three courses, so I tried nine dishes in all, not a single one of which was the least bit original or inspired.  Everything was something that would have been really interesting and fresh on a 1998 menu, but it all seems pretty tired and standard now.  Aside from occasionally having access to some ingredients that home cooks are not likely to find (or to afford, at least not on the regular) it was mostly stuff that one could cook at home, if one had the time.  It was extremely loud and crowded, and our server was exactly the sort of old, white man that you'd have expected to find serving you at some upscale steak restaurant in the 1980's.\n\nNevertheless, as I said, every dish was perfectly cooked, and it was, overall, a great meal.  It just wasn't interesting enough to justify the prices, the accolades, or the (evident) pride and self-satisfaction they have.\n\nWe ate here one week after eating at Cyrus (an absolutely amazing new restaurant in Healdsburg), and Boulevard couldn't even compete.  It was practically like fast food compared to Cyrus.  Whereas we were constantly amazed at Cyrus before we even tasted the food (as well as after), Boulevard underwhelmed us from the moment we looked at the menu (which featured a mere handful of familiar, standard entrees).\n\nThis seems like the perfect place for a business lunch that's getting reimbursed, where you want to play it safe and make sure your clients and colleagues can all find something to eat that will be cooked perfectly, but it's certainly not the kind of place you want to go if you're looking to get excited about what you're going to eat.", "author": "David B."}

The combination of food, the professional service, and the location and ambiance, make Boulevard the perfect special occasion restaurant.\n\nHaving eaten there several times now, I can't say enough about their menu. It's comfortable, formal (yet not quite as stuffy as a Aqua or Gary Danko), and always happening.\n\nBoulevard has enough reviews by people who either love it (like me) or hate it and think it's overpriced, so i won't rant too long as i usually do. It's definitely not cheap, but if i have guests coming to SF and want the \"best\" San Francisco restaurant experience, I always take them to Boulevard and no one is ever disappointed.\n\nIf you want REALLY special occasion type of eating, then go to Gary Danko or Michael Minna or Fifth Floor, but for a guaranteed great experience that has the perfect amount of formal-ness, Boulevard is the place.", "author": "Don T."}

We were in L'Avenue room downstairs for a party of about 30 people. The menu was set and it was the \n\nMIXED MARKET TOMATOES\nFregola & Parmesan-Feta & Olives-Burrata & Basil\nExtra Virgin Olive Oil 14.75\n\nEntree - Choice of:\nWASHINGTON KING SALMON\nWILD CAUGHT & GRILLED\nLobster Mushrooms, Parsley Garlic Sauce\nCreamed Brentwood Corn, Maine Lobster 37\n\nBERKSHIRE PORK TENDERLOIN (KUROBUTA)\nWOOD OVEN ROASTED\nSlow Roasted Rib, Braised Bacon\nSauteed Spinach, Brown Butter Figs & Almonds, Roasted Pork Jus 30\n\nDessert (none listed on Boulevard's site) - Choice of:\nBrownie something\n\nRasbperry sorbet sundae-ish thing\n\nThe tomatoes starter was good but nothing particularly special for almost $15 bucks. A quarter of a green, red, and orange heirloom tomato with two slices of feta cheese--I wish the organizers had chosen something else.\n\nThe wild salmon was cooked well--meaning it was not overly done in the middle. However, someone oversalted parts of the exterior and took away from the dish. The fish was probably about the size of an a medium brownie. The base the fish was sitting on was okay as well. My coworker's fish was overdone and not pinkish inside unfortunately.\n\nWe both chose the raspberry thing. This is what the waiter recommended and it was absolutely disgusting. I wish Boulevard had it on their site so I could describe it. The raspberry sorbet was good but the rest was atrociously sweet and with horrible texture. I hope they take it off the menu. I almost considered asking for the other dessert.\n\nService was above average. I had to ask for my sparkling water to be refilled everytime. They were good about refilling wine and flat water though.\n\nThis restaurant seems to get stellar reviews or mediocre reviews and I happen to fall on the side of mediocre and its less acceptable due to the high price. There are so many other restaurants in the city that are better for the same or less money. When the cheapest entree starts at  $30 and goes up from there, the food should be exceptional and nothing should be disgusting and so it is held to a higher standard and thus two stars.\n\nAlthough I have not been to Michael Mina or Gary Danko--I'll be certain to give either of those a try before I ever go back to Boulevard. \n\nVerdict: let someone else pay.", "author": "Zoom Z."}

And up until my last visit I couldn't even think of anything negative to say about the place, at all.   It was, to me, the perfect dining experience\nBUT, always the proverbial but, the last time I went instead of making reservations at 5 or 5:30 as I usually do, the other diners in my party wanted a later reservation and 9 was all that was available.  Ok, 5 or 9 that's fine.\nI told the person taking the reservation that 2 in our party of 3 were disabled (I can't stand for more than 10 minutes without being in excruciating pain and my friend is in similar shape) so if we took the 9 could they please, please, PLEASE, note it so we could be seated \"somewhat promptly\".  \"It shouldn't be a problem and I have made a note\".  We arrived at 8:50 for our 9 pm reservation and weren't seated till 10pm.    \nI wanted to die by 9:15 and thought I was going to pass out but the hostess kept insisting that it would only be a few more minutes.\nThey couldn't offer me a glass of water? or get chair so I could sit?   They were made aware of the situation both at booking and again upon arrival and could easily have said they would not be able to accommodate our request.   Does one have to have one leg or be in a wheelchair for them to \"see\" it?  or do you have to file an ADA suit for them to be accommodating?  We both have handicapped placards and the scars to prove that we are disabled, just because we don't \"look\" disabled doesn't mean we aren't.  It often means we've rested all day just to be there and won't be able to move the day after. \nI can't remember what I ate, I was in too much pain, and the thought of going back makes me shudder.  \nNo matter how good the food is, you shouldn't have to suffer to dine there.  They easily could have told me it would be impossible to make sure we were seated promptly with a 9pm reservation as I called Boulevard directly, during the day and spoke to a real person and made the situation VERY clear.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-06-01", "description": "I'm not a fan of the crappy Yelp review because it does seem too easy, but I must say that my one and only visit to Boulevard was a disappointment from the moment we sat down.  Perhaps it was the waiter, who seemed to be phoning it in.  He wasn't rude, nor was he inattentive - he just seemed robotic and unenthusiastic.  We like to ask the waitstaff what they like, what's best and fresh that night - but our guy gave us the party line and moved on without a smile.  The food seemed 1999 - nothing extraordinary, and we were confused by the pork-with-side of pork ball and fish-with-side-of-fishball entrees.  The smaller items seemed out of place and, honestly, weren't very good.\n\nBut, as underwhelming as my experience might have been, it was *nothing* compared to the poor couple next to us.  They were probably in their early 70s, already seated when we sat down, and I  noticed them because I overheard our waiter say to them, loudly and slightly annoyed, \"No Sir, a Pinot Gris is a WHITE wine.\"  As my husband and I were finishing our dessert (and we are slow eaters) I heard the gentleman yell, \"Take them away!  We don't want them!\"  We looked over to discover that they had been waiting over an *hour* for their entrees, which were just arriving.  We were eating dessert and they were STILL WAITING!  The junior waitress who brought over their entrees was confused, and he explained that he had been asking about his entrees repeatedly, and was at this point waiting for someone to bring his bill so he could leave.\n\nAt this point, I felt as if the hostess or manager, or perhaps even his & our original lackluster waiter, should have come over, apologized profusely, and comped whatever food and wine this couple managed to ingest.  But no - they sent that poor junior waitress back to the table to present the bill and that was that.  No formal apology.  \n\nMaybe Boulevard cold be forgiven for not evolving its menu past its heyday, and on a busy Saturday night you might even forgive the meh waitstaff OR a forgotten table.  But to so egregiously screw up with a table and not even send a formal apology \"from the house?\"  Or comp the meal?  Unforgivable.", "author": "Catherine K."}

This is solid, traditional food, with plenty of meat offerings, nothing complicated, fussy or alienating, and made with fresh ingredients.  It will let your out-of-town, khaki-wearing uncle or dad or Nancy Reagan feel satisfied after the end of the meal.   I don't live or work around here, but the bar area looks comfy enough, and has some small tables for tossing back cockies.\n\nThe crab salad with citrus was the best dish and wonderfully done -- fresh, dense crab, without any disgusting mayo or cream sauce to kill the flavor of the sea,  blended with a bright, acid orange.   Excellent.  My brother's filet steak was a bit tough, which was surprising considering how carefully done everything else was,  but the flavor was grassy and deep.   As invertebrates are tasty, the stuffed squid was ordered, along with the abalone.   We thought we were going to get a chunk of whole abalone, pristine and firm.  What we got reduced abalone, but it was still flavorful.  Raw abalone would probably be too challenging.\n\nThe server was a very casual and helpful guy -- very good service -- and the folks were happy.  I don't personally go for the Belle Epoque-style but it doesn't get me writhing like some of the crochety reviewers.

I have been Jardiniere, Farallon, Nick's Cove, and now Boulevard.  I feel like these restaurants are permanently stuck in 1990.  They are big and flashy, but belong to a different era.  I think Pat Kuleto's time has come and gone.  These restaurants may still thrill tourists, but locals are too smart to be blinded by his dated Belle Epoque obsession.\n\nAfter living in the city for 10 years, I decided to try Boulevard.  I always assumed that this restaurant was overrated and avoided it.  I would walk by once in a while on the way to the Ferry Building and check out the menu or peak inside.  Finally, my curiosity got the best of me and I had dinner here on Saturday night.\n\nWe had an early reservation and after a painfully slow cab ride, we arrived at Boulevard.  I was instantly excited by the frenetic pace of the first dinner rush.  The restaurant was packed and bursting with energy.  The Audiffred Building is beautifull, even if the interior is a little dated.  I looked around and saw mostly tourists and business people.  There was a table of financial district workers sucking down cocktails and making jokes about the economy.  There was an old guy with a younger date, who had a bottle of Sine Qua Non Omega opened on his table.  It felt like 2005 and that was not a bad thing.\n\nI looked at the menu and tried to keep an open mind.  Finally, I ordered the foie gras.  For $27 it was not a bad choice, but it could have been better.  Maybe it was the price, it just felt like something was missing.  There were all kinds of things on the plate, citrus, sweetness, and brioche.  I felt like I had seen this set up before with a different presentation.  I should mention that my wife had the ravioli with truffles and almost sent it back.  It was lukeroom and tasted like it had been sitting around under a heat lamp.\n\nI had the lamb T-Bone for an entree and it was huge.  Too big really.  The meat was cooked perfectly and tasted fine, but I did not really want to eat the entire thing. \n\nAt any rate, Boulevard is a landmark.  Great building, great location, big name owners, and all that.  I think the problem is that all of this has lead to some complacency.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-23", "description": "I am really torn as to whether I should give Boulevard another chance. On one hand I feel it definitely deserves another chance. \nI am a pretty liberal star giver and I am really pretty fair in my reviews you would really have to do something to piss me off to get one star. I usually give four stars to places that I frequent usually they are moderately priced and the quality is good. 5 stars if a place really makes my taste buds scream and beg for more. Neither one of those scenarios happened for me when I dined at the Boulevard. \n\n\nI will say that their service is impeccable and that Boulevard does have what it takes to give you a \"dining\" experience. Most places I go to I want to eat and get out, but there is something about the ambiance and attention to detail at Boulevard that makes you want to linger and soak up what really is old aristocratic San Francisco of the Railroad Barron days. It is easy to kind of get transported back in time by low lit chandeliers, that could have held oil lamps at one time, the deep dark mahogany walls, the concave brick ceiling, and the sign that looks like it was something that was made back in the medieval times. For decor and service Boulevard rightly deserves 5+ stars. It was the food that disappointed me. \n\n\nNow I am not easily disappointed by food in fact I tend to eat a lot of it. I'm pretty fat. I got fat by eating. \n\n\nOn to the food which was where I feel Blvd failed. \n\n\nThe wife had 2 filets of patrale sole sandwiching a shrimp and lobster puree. I tasted the dish and I felt it was a tad bit fishy. Petrale Sole is one of my all time favorite fish in the sea. I eat a lot of it I have cooked a lot of it, I have cooked a lot of it for a lot of different people. I cook it very well. There is not too much to it, you buy fresh sole, fry it in a combination of olive oil and butter over medium high heat for 2-3 minutes and season. I feel like the sole that she was served was overcooked. It wasn't moist. And worst of all... it smelt a little fishy. Seafood should never smell fishy. Ironic I know but the truth nonetheless. This was very disappointing to me because although my sole doesn't have the fancy puree in it I know I'd rather eat mine than theirs again. The wife agreed. \n\n\nI had the Scottish Farm Raised Salmon, which was cooked to perfection. I feel like it was a little under seasoned but not by much, because the taste of Salmon is very unique and I enjoy it by itself. I do think that wild caught tastes better but I guess that wouldn't be too PC considering Salmon are at low numbers and such. The salmon wasn't why I ordered the dish though. It was supposed to be served on a Morel Mushroom risotto which was the real reason i ordered the dish. Mine came with an asparagus risotto which was flavorless, a shame because asparagus takes on the flavors you cook it with. It doesn't have a very distinct flavor like a leek or Fennel that can stand on their own. You have to season an asparagus dish. \n\n\nThe winner of the night was definitely the lamb T-bone, which was cooked perfectly... bloody, and was seasoned well bathed in it's own au jus. When I go back I'll order that. The Veal Sweetbreads were absolutely phenomenal as well and I can't wait to try the foie gras. \n\nWill I be back? Definitely. Will I order seafood again? No. From my experience where the Blvd shines is with dishes where the main course had parents, suckled from them, and walked on land. \n\n5 stars service and ambiance \n1 stars for the seafood \n5 stars for the meat that was red \n5 stars for the veal shortbreads that were fantastic \n\nI look forward to going there again and hopefully giving more stars.", "author": "Anthony Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-20", "description": "As soon as I walked through the revolving doors, I knew it was going to be a special night. To describe the holiday decor as \"festive\" would not be doing this restaurant justice - garlands, wreaths, and glistening ornaments decorating the ceilings, walls, and walkways make the already beautiful interior nothing short of breathtaking. The whole dining room sparkled like there was magic in the air. I know, I know that's totally cheesy but hey, I know magic when I see it.\n\nIf the atmosphere isn't enough to put you in the holiday spirit (i.e. the spirit of giving hundreds of dollars to this restaurant for dinner), then the food certainly will. While the selection of primary proteins in the starters and main courses may not vary significantly throughout the year, you're reminded that it's the holiday season through the supporting cast of ingredients - pistachios, beets, squash, pumpkin spice, cranberry, pomegranate seeds, chestnuts, parsnip, and quince add a huge helping of holiday charm to the menu. So much so that I was tempted to break out my bear skin rug and cozy up with some eggnog in front of the ovens - I don't think the chefs would've minded.\n\nWe started with the RED ABALONE paired with pancetta, potato mousseline, and abalone mushrooms - ingredients that didn't overpower the abalone's delicate flavor; and, the mushrooms mirrored the texture of the abalone perfectly. We also had the seared FOIE GRAS - a preparation saturated in holiday flavors with Pumpkin Brioche, Spiced Butternut Squash, Chili Candied Pecans, Cranberry Crackle & Burnt Caramel. I was ecstatic to try such a classic dish served in this way,  and it was exceptional. The PHEASANT LEG/RAVIOLI followed (apparently it tastes like chicken!), which was a bit on the dry side, but was saved by the delicious jus that accompanied it. Also of note, while I don't particularly like cod, the LOBSTER and COD was beautifully cooked, and the risotto was packed with flavor, giving the cod the boost it needed. Finally, the HUCKLEBERRY TART with fleur de sel ice cream, cinnamon, and pomegranate seeds was a perfectly sweet/tart/salty end to a perfectly seasonal menu. \n\nService was...well, let's put it this way: it was good service at an exceptionally busy time. Certain grievances, like not bringing the bread soon enough, or the rushed demeanor of our waiter, were really symptoms of how slammed they were, not of how professional/attentive the service is. When it slowed down a bit, the waiter even catered to my annoying requests and helped me take pictures of the food by shining a light over the plates. Yep. I'm that girl. \n\nMy conclusion? I couldn't have picked a better restaurant for my holiday celebration dinner. Boulevard put the magic of Christmas in my belly, and for that, I'm thankful.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

Why? Because my experience was so wonderful, so amazing, so romantic, that I could never imagine making that feeling commonplace.\n\nI took my baby for her birthday and we dined and drank and spent all night in total bliss.\n\nShe had scallops that were cooked *perfectly*, sitting a top a very cool pureed potato thing (not to be confused with mashed potatoes), and topped off with foie gras.\n\nI had the most succulent piece of french-cut pork I've ever eaten. I wanted to pick it up by the bone handle and suck it.  I didn't.  But I wanted to.  It was smoked, and cooked, and slathered in honey and truffle oil, then stuffed with applewood smoked bacon and chanterelles and fennel.  It was divine.  \n\nThe waiter was very pleasant. He wasn't overly gregarious, flamboyant, or cold - he was just professional and helpful.  We ordered a really great bottle of wine at his recommendation (Emily's Cuvee, Russian River Pinot Noir '02 $50) and it was so good we bought it from a store at a later date.\n\nThe dessert looked like the celebrity special.

We got a reservation for 3 at a decent time with just a day's notice.  Was immediately impressed with the decor: classic old world, like something you would see in a 20's movie.  \n\nI started getting nervous after waiting quite a while for our waiter to show his face. After asking for our water selection (not made to feel too inferior for selecting \"tap\"), he disappeared for another lengthy stretch. Fortunately, our \"tap\" did finally arrive and he returned to take our order shortly thereafter.\n\nToday's soup, a lobster bisque, was a very satisfying selection.  A nice balance of fish stock and creaminess, not too salty as often happens. My colleague had the tuna tartare that looked just too fabu.  I resisted the urge to help myself.\n\nI selected the paella as my entree. The word \"paella\" is in quotes on the menu, so I knew it would be untraditional.  2 shrimp, 2 pieces of dungeness crab clawmeat, a guinea hen thigh served on a bed of spanish style rice with peas, chorizo, and fava beans. The shrimp and crab were cooked perfectly; I was less impressed by the rest of the dish. How did they get those favas so small and shrivelled?\n\nDessert is clearly the star here. We eagerly sampled each others dessert selections (chocolate tart, toffee pear caramel, blackberry parfait) and declared each outstanding.\n\nI resisted asking to see the check since I was a guest, but a lunch for 3 without any liquor easily went to $125.

Is this because older people are less welcoming to change?\n\nThe Rack of Lamb I shared was good but I'm not going to go back until this place turns just a smidgen more relaxed, or I get constipated.", "author": "Lauren G."}

The food - from the golden beet and goat cheese ravioli (which had an egg yolk inside each ravioli, shaved truffles on top and sat in a light nutty sauce), to the seared foie gras (which arrived on top of just-baked cornbread-like bread with blackberries), to the lamb T-bone (I usually don't like heavy meat dishes...but this one was amazing) to the sea bass (AWESOME potatoes) - was simply sumptuous, decadent and delicious. Since it was my bf's bday, we ordered the baked chocolate doughnut - OMG my arteries are still clogged...but it was so, so GOOD. \n\nOne thing to note - the service was amazing. Our waitress was so nice, friendly and down-to-earth - she didn't even laugh at me when I asked if we could take a picture with Nancy Oakes.

We sat right next to the open kitchen which was awesome because I love seeing chefs in action.  We started with the Royal Sweet Sea Scallops -- definitely one of the best scallop dishes I've ever had, and I've had a lot!  Garnish with pancetta, thinly shaved radish, fresh hazelnuts and this green garlic spaetzle that was a revelation.  My main was the swordfish in a chorizo sauce with large white beans and small potatoes.  The fish was good but it came with prawns that turned out to be mushy, really surprising for the hype I've heard about this place.  My boyfriend had the sea bass, cooked really nicely with kind of a small portion size.\n\nThey serve half bottles of wine which was nice, and we shared a half of Sancerre.  Dessert selections weren't great to me but I don't typically like dessert so I guess I'm biased. \n\nOverall the decor was nice, food was good, but it wasn't an amazing experience.

You will impress your guests, have an amazing meal, and feel special having dinner here.\n\nThe following are comments on my dining experience for dinner on Friday April 10.   The wine list is varied, but wow is it expensive, with very few bottles under $50.  We settled on a simple French table wine for $55 (Crozes Hermitage), which was an excellent choice as it was complex but light.   \n\n I had the crab stuffed calamari appetizer, which was quite good.  Although, the crab was very bland.  My partner had the scallops appetizer that was excellent.   For mains we had the Halibut and the Lamb.  The lamb was delicious and the halibut was perfectly cooked.  My halibut really did not stand out in any way.  The halibut was served with a bland sauce,  over some spinach and a side of potatoes.\n\nThe lamb was also served with a side of potatoes, that were quite basic.  I looked around and saw many people not eating their potatoes.  Potatoes just don't excite me, not that I don't enjoy eating them.  I noted a general lack of vegetables and greens with my meal.  I'm always surprised by San Francisco restaurants that tout Organic and Sustainable and the protein is the highlight of the dish!  Aren't we supposed to be eating more vegetables as part of our meals?\n\nWe shared the banana tiramisu for dessert, that was truly magnificient and was an updated version of the famous white chocolate banana cream pie.", "author": "Robert R."}

Our entrees were only fair, my pork chop was luke warm, soggy-no char- like it had been sitting there a while, covered in a strange sweet sticky sauce which I found entirely too sweet, oddly balanced.  It was our anniversary, we started with cocktails and ended with Butterscotch pudding for dessert.  They added a Happy Anniversary white chocolate piece onto the pudding but still charged us for the pudding.  Really? Butterscotch pudding was actually chocolate pudding drizzled with a butterscotch sauce that was barely visible, and hard to taste.   My partner's Filet was bland served with a fingerling potato, boring.  There are no sides unless you consider a smear of potato or other unrecognizable food stuff a side.  Drinks were so-so but overly priced.  The glass of Prelude Pinot Noir our server suggested was just ok-we had to ask what kind it was after the glass was served midway into our meal.  The staff clearing tables was excellent and we tipped them separately, they were that good.

The salad was nice, but it was the abalone that really set the tone for a perfect dinner.\n\nSecond round:\n\nCRISPY MARYLAND SOFT SHELL CRAB paired with Crispy Green Beans, Shiitake Mushrooms, Pickled Armenian Cucumber, and ginger miso mayo. The crab was good, but a little heavy. I would have preferred a lighter, vinegar based sauce to accompany the fried crab. The CALAMARI STUFFED with CRAB & APPLEWOOD SMOKED HAM HOCK was absolutely delicious!

They were visiting from the East Coast and my father has wanted to go to Boulevard for years - ever since he saw Mark Bitman doing some kind of competition with Nancy Oakes on a NY television station.\n\nAnyway, I digress... a few Yelpers have mentioned \"attitude\" issues at Boulevard and I MUST disagree.  Last night, the hostess originally led us to a table along the aisle near the open kitchen.  Because of the foot traffic from the wait staff, I asked her to move us somewhere a little less busy.  In less than a minute, we were seated at a lovely banquette corner table by the windows.  The folks at Boulevard have done this before when I wanted a different table, and they complied with a smile and no attitude whatsoever.\n\nLater on, I walked over to the waitress and told her it was my parents' anniversary and asked if there was any way we could get an autographed menu for a keep sake.  The waitress smiled and said she would absolutely do her best, even though Nancy Oakes was VERY busy.  5 minutes later, Nancy Oakes came over to our table to congratulate my parents on their anniversary and we chatted for a few minutes.  You cannot pay for that kind of gesture... she did that out of good will.  Even better, when the bill came, a menu was tucked into the cover of the bill with a personal greeting from Nancy Oakes to my parents.  \n\nThis is an experience we will never forget and it only enamors me more to Boulevard.\n\nFor what it's worth, the truly yummy meal included:\nStarters:\nCalamari stuffed with Dungeness Crab\nGuinea hen stuffed ravioli - decadent and rich\nSeared Day Scallops - yes there are only two, but the flavor is remarkable.\nEntrees:\nFilet of Sole - a seared crust to die for and a rich buttery flavor\nNY Pave Steadk & Short Rib - once of Nancy Oakes new dishes and a definite winnner\nSuckling Pig trio - too good to describe...\n______________________________________________________\n\nI've had two great meals here, and loved the place both times.  I don't know why people think the portions are so small... they seemed perfect to me.  My friend had the Filet Mignon and I had the Veal last time and the flavor was impeccable.  \n\nI agree it has the potential to be noisy near the bar area, especially since  I did go on a Friday the first time. You can easily get past that by getting a reservation on an \"off-peak: day... that way you can escape the happy hour noise of Fridays and the crowds on Saturdays.", "author": "Audrey E."}

After we ordered, we were brought crusty, partially whole wheat sourdough bread, served cold and slightly stale; it came with ice-cold butter that was nearly impossible to spread.  Definitely not a highlight of the meal.  We had high hopes for the sea scallops appetizer but were disappointed: the plate was covered in various additions (e.g., a sweet potato-red pepper mash, and purple potato chips) that had more of a trying-too-hard than a perfect-combination-of-flavors effect.  The salmon entree was no better, and was served lukewarm from spending too long sitting in the kitchen.  The halibut was cooked perfectly but unfortunately nothing special. The one standout dish was the lamb tbone, which was cooked perfectly (so juicy!) and nicely presented.  We enjoyed the bittersweet chocolate brulee and dark chocolate mousse, but weren't blown away, and some of the fruity flavors lurking in the presentation were a turn off.  The tea we ordered for dessert came in the form of a mighty leaf tea bag; at this caliber of restaurant, I've come to expect loose leaf or more exciting tea selections.\n\nThe service: While our server provided an excellent wine recommendation, he was less than attentive: we struggled to get his attention to order drinks when we arrived, and to order a bottle of wine for dinner.\n\nThe ambiance: The open, fairly light dining room is better for groups than for romance.  While the water front location is nice, most tables in the long dining room are far from the view.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't be embarrassed to take friends here, but certainly wasn't impressed!", "author": "Kay O."}

I understand this isn't a family-style portion restaurant, but the appetizers are just meant to be INDIVIDUAL appetizers (i.e. when you order the calamari, it's just three pieces, not a huge basket).

I was dining with a group of 8 and most of the party arrived before our reservation time.  I ordered a Grey Goose on the Rocks with olives \"a little dirty\".  As the bartender brought my drink he alerted me to the fact that the olives had pits and also provided a very small bowl for the pits.  I guess he knew I was the kind of person that would spit the pits onto the floor or toss them in a dinner that was passing by, so I gave him points for recognizing problem diners/drinkers.  The olives with pits surprised me since every other drink I have had with olives always came pitted.  Was I surprised when I tasted the olive, as it was the freshest and most flavorful olive I have ever had.  Remarkably delicious!\n\n\nWhen we were seated at our dinner table we were promptly met by our professional server.  And I mean professional in every sense of the word.  This gentleman knew his stuff from the extensive wine list to each and every dish on the menu.  I started with a simple Mixed Geeens Salad with apple slices, sliced gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts and a delicious light but distinctively flavored vinagrette dressing.  A quarter loaf of  sour dough bread was put at each end of the table with small tubs of butter that had sea salt sprinkled on the top.  I had a view of the bread station from my seat and do they ever go through bread.  Tons of it!  When I tasted it I discovered why.  The sour dough bread was delicious with a great crunchy crust.  We ordered two bottles of Pride 2006 Cabernet (remember it was a party of 8) which was recommended by a member of our group and no one was disappointed and at $160  a bottle it was well worth the price.  I had an incredible pan seared halibut dish that had a sauce that was even more delicious than the fish itself.  Other diners' selections at our table included Filet Mignon, Lobster Tail, Veal, etc. and everyone raved about the perfection of all dishes.  We asked for another bottle of Pride Cab, but were told we had the last two bottles.  We then ordered two more bottles of Nickel & Nickel Cab (which is a Far Niente \"related\" wine at a fraction of the cost) at $150 per bottle and as superb as the Pride Cab was this was even better!\n\nOrdinarily I do not eat dessert after a late night meal, however, since I was catching a flight back to LAX at 10:43 pm, I figured the energy (or sugar high) would be good for me.  I had a chocolate dessert that was recommended by our server that had a multitude of textures and incredible rich chocolate flavor that was a delight to my already satisfied taste buds.\n\nYou have to try this great restaurant when you have the chance.

This place is beautiful, all the staff, even the hostess were warm and not haughty at all.  The manager often walked the floor checking with his wait staff and the patrons.  Being able to view the cooking was actually an enjoyable experience for once, the kitchen flow was like a well synchronized dance - everyone knew their place, there was no shouting, banging or dirtiness.  \n\nI was extremely impressed with our server.  We were here for my mom's birthday and one member of our party had a difficult time getting to the restaurant, actually took over 45 minutes to arrive after we were seated!  Our server was so accommodating, she never made us feel bad for the delay, she never rushed us, but rather made our time enjoyable and comforting.  She suggested we enjoy some beverages for a time and chat until our guest arrived, she answered our questions and guided us through the menu nicely.  When our guest still hadn't arrived, she took our appetizer orders and we ordered one for our missing guest.  By the time we got our appetizer and ate it, our guest still wasn't there.  The server came back and said she was going to have the chef remake the appetizer (it was scallops) so that they will be fresh and ready when our guest came.  Mind you we didn't even request that, because we didn't want to inconvenience them already..she took the initiative and she didn't just have the kitchen re-heat the meal, but they gave us a new one completely.  Our guest arrived and the meal went perfectly.\n\nThe desert course was wonderful and we were sitting at a table right by the desert chef, so it was fun to watch him plate and arrange the deserts throughout the night.  My mom by far had the best desert it was a strawberry key lime tart with margarita granita on top - just wonderful.  The whole experience was beautiful.", "author": "Erin A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-03", "description": "Really, I should write a much longer review, given the number of times I've had a truly wonderful experience at this SF institution.  This is only my second Yelp review, and Boulevard just comes to mind as my favorite place to dine, especially if someone is taking me there.\n\nYes, I am in the restaurant biz myself--I have been for over 20 years, and 15 of those years have been waiting tables at many of the City's other great restaurants.  Why I've never worked at Boulevard--I guess I'd like to save it for a purely fun place.  And because I've been around the block in this biz, perhaps I do get the insider treatment, but hey people--it's one of the few perks of a truly backbreaking burnout prone profession.\n\nBut let me recount with glory past meals of Crispy Quails, Veal Oscar, (modernised, soo delicious), Lamb Tenderloin, Corn and Scallop Soup...everything kind of recedes into a warm twinkly glow of gracious service and rich, honest, satisfying food.  \n\nIt's the kind of place where I dress up maybe as a favorite movie character ala Audrey Hepburn or Jane Birkin or Charlotte Rampling, and have a handsome fellow take me out for a 3 hour lunch.  This is NOT a place for a rushed pre-theatre dinner or 45-minute chicken caesar lunch.  This IS a place to order Champagne--before splurging on an elegant Burgundy to pair with the Duck or the Veal with Mushrooms.  \n\nA place to ask your waiter to give you a rest between entree and dessert, so that you can build up the strength to order a cheese course as well, and linger over espressos and Eau de Vies.  (Or maybe Calvados)\n\nPerhaps because I *do* know how to dine here, and I *am* able to cultivate relationships with the mgmt and staff, this review is so positive.  But you need not toil in the restaurant biz like I have to achieve this--if only more diners knew how absolutely thrilled restaurateurs are to pamper interested, engaging customers.  \n\nIf you love a restaurant, make yourself known to the staff and the managers with a warm thank you and flat out ask them to put a note by your reservation record of how much you liked your meal. Believe me, the next time you return, you'll be royalty.  (And you don't have to spend like a king to be treated like one.)", "author": "Andrea W."}

I don't know if they were short-staffed or what, but the time between courses was very long. It took a while to get the order in, and then a while to get the starter (scallops, delicious and perfectly cooked despite the wait), and then the real waiting began. . . the entrees took forever to arrive (we finished the wine before they even got there). Then, we waited for a very long time for them to collect the plates once we were done. Once we ordered dessert, the coffee and port came out first, and the dessert almost 20 minutes later. I couldn't even enjoy my coffee with my dessert--come on, Boulevard! \n\nBad or slow service really takes away from the guests' enjoyment of the meal.

My wife and I like to play the folded napkin test where, if one of us leaves the table, and any of the wait staff fold the napkin before return to the table it passes the test.

The temperature of the dishes were right on and the portions just right.\n\nThe warm bread was crusty and the inside light and airy, butter creamy.\n\nThe wines we chose were an 2004 Haven's Merlot Napa ($10,50/glass) and 2004 Scherrer Pinot Noir Russian River Valley ($17,50/glass).

My boyfriend and I got a last minute reservation and the table was waiting for us when we arrived. I love the architecture of this place (kudos to Kuleto) and the interior was very romantic. I am not sure I would want to be seated under the brick arc ceiling during an earthquake though. The one big contrast to the overall feel of the restaurant  would be the long walk to the restrooms downstairs in what appeared to be a different building.\n\nI had read that the appetizers were exceptionally good, and I must agree that the crab stuffed calamari was delicious. In fact, that might have been my favorite dish. We ordered a bottle of pinot gris (Etude) and had entrees of local petrale sole and Atlantic black bass. The food arrangement was nice but a little misleading; my sole was folded in half making it taller and I had four fingerling potatoes lined up on the side, but my initial thought was that it was like that Citibank commercial where the man says the food is like elf food. However, when I began eating the dish, the meal easily filled me up. And both fish dishes were tres yummy.\n\nFor dessert we opted for a citrus plate with lemon sherbet. I think all of our selections complemented each other and really made the meal a memorable one.\n\nWe did the \"guess the bill\" game before opening the bill wallet. We both actually overguessed the amount, which turned out to still be the most expensive meal the two of us has eaten together (about $160 for a bottle of wine, app, 2 entrees, and a dessert).", "author": "Lori G."}

However, two women were seated next to us shortly after we arrived.  One said nothing, ordered nothing and drank nothing.  The other woman was clearly intoxicated.  Upon arriving she spilled her martini on her friend so they got her another one.  She spoke very loudly and every other word was an expletive or crude statement. I am not exagerating.  Call the Manager, Adam Volpe, to confirm.  At first we found it amusing but she never stopped, and her friend never said a word.  She just continued a loud monologue of F this, MFing that, piece of S&*# that, talking about mens' penises, etc...  The bus boy, waiter and manager each came over to her on different occasions and she was asked to be quieter at least four times to no avail.  She then complained that she had ordered another drink but it never arrived (because they obviously cut her off).  Our waiter apologized many times and said we would be taken care of.  The manager also came over and apologized but did nothing else except finally offer to move us to a \"quieter\" table when we were almost through our entrees, but we were polite and declined.  When we left I let my wife go ahead and I told off the obnoxious woman about how foul mouthed, rude and inconsiderate she was.  Her response was \"Who the F#*& are you!\"  Other patrons waiting at the valet commented to us about the situation so they obviously heard her during their dinner.\n\nThe Question:  What should the restaurant have done?  If they asked her to leave she very likely would have made a scene.  Apparently they were unable to move us until we were almost done with dinner.  Should we have punished our waiter with the tip?  We chose not to.  While they said they would take care of us all they did was comp one dessert and our port, which amounted to 15% of a $300 bill.  I thought they would have at least comped us either the appatizers, the entrees or the wine.  At that point I just wanted to get out of there.

The moment we stepped into Boulevard one of the staff greeted us as if we were long-time friends. We arrived 15 minutes earlier than our reservation, but they seated us right away. After looking over the extensive menu, I was torn between about 5 different appetizers, but I decided on the foie gras. I knew that I would have to hit the gym on a daily basis for the next few weeks to compensate for the amount of calories I was about to consume, but the foie gras was well worth it. I would become a regular at the gym, in fact, if it meant that I could enjoy the Boulevard's foie gras once again! It was of course extremely rich, the texture was wonderfully buttery, and absolutely delightful served atop a crisp mellow flavored biscotti. The dish was paired with a lovely tart sauce, and the tomatoes on the side were so sweet and juicy they tasted someone like plums. I've never had such fresh tomatoes in my life.\nFor my main, I ordered the lamb of course, and as the world's biggest lamb fanatic, I was not disappointed. It was perfectly cooked, with a slightly burnt (I love that smoky burnt flavor of crispness) on the outside, and the inside was a beautiful pink color. The fat fell right off the meat as I trimmed it off. Also, I was surprised at the generous portion of this dish as such high class restaurants tend to serve very small portions; I had 3 large chunks on lamb on my plate. As with the foie gras, the accompanying flavors of the dish just blew me away. In the sauce, there was a hint of olives, goat cheese, so many interesting textures. I could eat that dish all day and discover a new combination of flavors with every bite.\nFor dessert, I had a cinnamon brioche topped with apple sorbet, paired with vanilla ice cream, raspberry sauce, and blackberries. The sorbet was so crisp, flavorful, and perfectly icy that I could have had that alone as a dessert. While the brioche was cold (I was expecting a hot dessert) and a bit dryer than normal, the vanilla and raspberry sauce paired perfectly with the brioche as the brioche eventually absorbed the moistness of the ice cream and sauce. The composition of the dish was beautiful, I suppose my only complain is that I had to construct so much of the dessert myself. (I am so impatient when it comes to dessert - I wish I could immediately inhale the entire dish rather than carefully put it together myself)\nThe reason that I am not giving 5 stars after my incredibly lovely dinner is that my friend's salmon was overly salty and someone overcooked. While I did not try the dish complete with the sides, which I'm sure would have made up for the salmon, the salmon alone I definitely could not have eaten an entire plate of.\nWhile the prices are certainly very high, I would definitely return for another night of elegance and extravagance. Also, the Boulevard is not one of those pretentious restaurants where normal people (like myself) would feel extremely uncomfortable among snobbish rich people. I noticed a very diverse crowd last night - businessmen, teenage couples, older couples...

They have valet parking which was about $12 for evening and it can be added to your bill. \nSadly we had to jet out before dessert to get to another engagement. \nGo for the relaxed atmosphere and fine dining experience.

I am a foodie and I thought that the food was excellent, but that the experience was marred by the service.\n\nWe had to make our reservation 3 weeks in advance and could only get a 9:00pm res.  OK, we thought, because that will decrease the likelyhood of having annoying children in the restaurant.  However, when we got there (on time) we had to wait at the bar for 20 minutes before we were seated next to a table with a newborn. (Thankfully they were just lingering over coffee and we only had to deal with the baby for a few minutes.)\n\nIt took 10 minutes for the server to come and introduce herself and another 10 for bread and water.  We really felt neglected at times, not a good thing in a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nOk for the food.  I will admit that it was excellent.  We did skip appetizers and just focused on the entrees and dessert.  I had the wild seared salmon on a bed of cream corn with rock shrimp.  It was one of the best preparations of salmon I've had.  A nice crispy crust from the sear that was well seasoned and under that, a very velvety fillet. Everything from the texture to the seasoning was spot on.  For dessert I had the figs in balsamic with baklava ice cream.  I've never had anything llike it. Very light and refreshing, but bold at the same time.\n\nWas it worth it?  The food was wonderful, but the service was so dissapointing, that I have a hard time justifying the cost of the meal.  I doubt that we ill go back anytime soon.

At first glance, it seems like the kind of restaurant where diners talk quietly and talking to your server is awkward.

We had the tuna tartare appetizer--my first time eating raw fish so I'm not a very good judge but it had flavors of ginger on fried taro or something. I had the salmon--an absolutely gorgeous fillet, it was like velvet. He had the suckling pig prepared three ways--one was great, one was good, one was meh. Our cotes du rhone wine was awesome, their wine list is probably the reason I would go back. For dessert we each had a bon bon that was vanilla ice cream dipped in chocolate on top of a chocolate covered mini pretzel--SO good. We also had the sticky toffee pudding which was definitely the highlight of the meal. For 2 cocktails, 1 bottle of wine, 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts, it was $150 which is not that bad!

We got a sidecar and something fruity (I forgot), but the drinks were $13-16 as it normally is at upscale restaurants. For our appetizer, we got the infamous ahi tuna tartare. It was very fresh and unique due to nori chips that came with it. We quickly ran out of chips, but eating the tuna is just like eating sashimi.\nL got the dayboat scallops with the saffron risotto. She really liked the dish, but complained how she had 3 dinky scallops for 21 dollars. Oh wells, she didn't have to pay for it. I tried the risotto and it was so smooth and flavorful. In my opinion, her dish was worth it. \nI got the American Kobe beef burger which came with roasted veggies, little gems lettuce, and fries. I really only liked the veggies and the fries, which were perfectly seasoned and came with a variety of sauces. However, I didn't think the meat was anything special, so I wouldn't order the burger again. I'm sure the burger at Wayfare would taste better.\nThe dessert was pretty awesome. We shared a chocolate candy bar cake, which was made with a rich flourless chocolate cake, nougat, ice milk, and ganache. What's not to like about this dessert?

The sonoma fois gras and the king salmon were also BIG hits.  The pork chop: a great cut of meat but overcooked to the point where getting off the bone and even cutting it was near impossible.  Overall it was a very enjoyable meal and I'm glad that after years of passing this place up and thinking it was just a tourist joint, I finally tried it.", "author": "Brenna C."}

You can pay a lot more at other restaurants like Gary Danko and stuff, so while this is expensive for me, I've had more expensive meals elsewhere. Actually I also hate how Yelp doesn't allow half stars but this would be a 4.5 in my book. i have to give it a 5 because of the value amongst fine dining places.\n\nI tried One Market and it's honestly not as good. The atmosphere is excellent in Boulevard. I got seated close enough to the kitchen to watch the chefs do their thing, but far enough where I can still enjoy a night with my girlfriend.\n\nAppetizer: Sea scallops + fried mushrooms. Wow this was just beyond delicious. Small portions, but I guess this meant we should've gotten our own. I forgot that fine dining gives perfectly sized portions! We shared this one, that's why.\n\nMains: I got the quail, and my girl got the sea bass w/ risotto. Both plates were delicious. I actually thought my dish was far better prepared and the meat was juicy, tender AND flavorful.\n\nDessert: Somehow I've already forgotten what we got as this was 4 months ago, but it was certainly wonderful.\n\nI've paid this price for a full 3 course meal at other restaurants, but there's a reason WHY Boulevard stands out AND has a Michelin star.\n\nI've tried other places like One Market, and they can't compare to Boulevard. This place just has a WOW to it. I'm going to recommend people who want to try out fine dining to first try out Boulevard. \n\nThe only thing I wish they had was a prix fixe menu.", "author": "Dennis M."}

The last time I had a perfect pork chop was at Seastar in Bellevue. Juicy, tender, perfect medium, and with cherries! Yumm, I love cherries! The only slight disappointment was the filet mignon, it was not medium rare as ordered, and it was a bit dry. My son ate it anyway, the restaurant was too busy for us to send a plate back. \nFor dessert, we ordered the nectarine and blueberries crisp. It was too sweet, do it made the fruits sour. But the homemade cherry chocolate chip ice cream and the peach sangria ice cream were excellent. \nIn all, a great meal.

Without fail, I will order the Crab and Avocado salad, one or two of the $3 dessert bonbons, and another, more major, dessert.\n\nThe Crab and Avocado salad is always transporting.  Many crab dishes at other places are ruined when someone goes crazy with things like onions in the crabcakes, which overpower the crab.  The creamy, understated taste of avocado makes a perfectly harmonious Ginger Rogers to the crab's Fred Astaire.  They vary the other ingredients in it, using grapefruit slices, or plum tomatoes, or whatever else seems fresh.  It's always great.  For the mains, I've had a great, tender pyramid ravioli with mushroom, salmon, and steaks; all have been marvelous.  The desserts are always memorable, especially when chocolate cake or ice cream, or a combination of the two, are involved.\n\nThe surroundings are pleasant, warm, and always put me in a wonderful mood.  The interior is tastefully done, and the neighborhood, up by the Ferry Building and the Bay Bridge, can be a nice place to wander for ten or twenty minutes, after dinner.  The drink selection is very good.  But above all, it's that crab and avocado salad that I keep dreaming of.  Fantastic work!", "author": "Andrew H."}

I don't have a problem with this - things go wrong in even the best systems, and the key to good service is how you deal with them.  In this instance, the words \"Please don't tell me that - it's our anniversary!\" were barely out of my mouth when the lovely, lovely woman at their end said she'd fix it for us and that we could turn up at 7.  \n\nWe duly did, and were given a great table, where we received truly excellent service.  Brilliantly attentive when needed (while ordering cocktails, selecting food and wine and discussing the selection of desserts), and utterly unobtrusive at all other times.  The atmosphere is busy and though the surroundings might suggest Continental stuffiness the application totally takes off any edge of that.  The clientele was a very mixed bag, which I appreciated - places that make you feel uncomfortable if you're not in a tie will never get many starts from me.  My money's as good as theirs.\n\nThe food was outstanding - I had scallops to start and my OH had what he described as \"The best salad I've ever had\".  Mains were great and the dessert list is one of those that makes you want a sampling platter of everything.  Portions were sensible and enough to make us feel comfortably full without being stuffed.\n\nWe splurged slightly on a bottle of Bollinger, La Grande Annee 1999 and regretted not a cent of the cost.\n\nWe've eaten in some truly world class restaurants in many countries, and we'd have no hesitation in listing our experience at Boulevard right up there with the best of them.", "author": "Jon M."}

A party of four Koreans, for a birthday dinner one Sunday night.\n\nIt's fancy, it's expensive, the portions are small, the service is excellent, the decor is beautiful, the wine is good.  \n\nMy dad being the old-school Korean that he is, was worried about being hungry at the end of the meal so he kept munching on the bread.  Thank goodness because the appetizers, though beautiful and tasty, are teeny tiny.  We had the ahi tuna app and the dungeness crab salad.  Very tasty but really hard to do family style on such tastebud teasers- seriously, I felt like we were poor people sharing our last crust of bread.\n\nMy mom got the seabass, it was overcooked.  Which was sad because it was her birthday.  She also whispered to my sister and myself that it needed hot sauce.  My dad dug into his walu which was excellent- it was gone in minutes.  My sister tried the duck, which she normally doesn't love but it too, surpassed expectations.  I grudgingly ordered the seafood risotto (I really wanted the pork but mom doesn't eat it and I wanted her to try everything) which ended up being wonderful.  The scallop was perfectly cooked.  All it needed was a side of kimchee.\n\nFor dessert we ordered the quince pear walnut cake which was soooo good and the profiterole and banana cream pie thing (which though tasty was too sugary with those crunchy pieces.)   Coffee was fair.\n\nThe 1/2 bottle of anderson valley pinot that we got, though incredibly full and tasty and probably one of the better pinots I've had in a long minute, came with a hefty price tag.\n\nI wouldn't say it's the most inventive, daring, or dynamic food or the most tasty- but for American fare it is quality food that is well prepared, well cooked, and well presented.  \n\nAll in all, it ended up being threefifty bones- otherwise known in working class people speak as an arm and a leg.

The restaurant offers seasonal cuisine with exquisitely fresh ingredients. I finally had the opportunity to try abalone. It was silky in texture and the decision to compliment the dish with guanciale was brilliant. I also had the rabbit and thought the loin was delicious but was not \"wowed\" by the addition of the breaded rabbit sirloin. My guest had the rack of lamb and he thought it was superb. The food is beautifully plated and it is obvious that the kitchen is at the top of their game. \n\nWhat I most enjoyed about Boulevard was the absence of attitude. Considering the reputation of the restaurant and the quality of the clientele, it was refreshing to dine in peace without being rushed by the server or intimidated by the sommelier. With regard to the wine selection, it is both reasonable and abundant. Although we brought our own bottle, we could not resist the half bottle selection. I tried the 2005 Ramey Chardonnay and I thought it was a winner (I recommend pairing it with the stuffed calamari and/or abalone).  \n\nIf you are looking to impress the one you love, or in my case celebrate a parent's birthday, Boulevard is the place to go. I would also like to thank the recommendation of a fellow reviewer who suggested requesting a seat in the back. The view of the Bay Bridge at night was gorgeous; it reminded me of that classic scene in the movie, \"Manhattan.\"", "author": "Blake S."}

It's such a cliche but this place was the only place so far where I've seen waiters holding up wine glasses and double check for stains before they bring them out to customers, I guess that kind of justifies the higher than average price they charge.", "author": "Bo D."}

It's been a long time since I've had a meal that left me wondering why anyone would eat anywhere else.  That's exactly what I was asking myself at the end of my meal at Boulevard.\n\nWe started off with the Tuna Tartare prepared two ways.  Both ways were exceptionally good and exceptionally complimentary of each other.  After much debate (ok, not that much debate) I couldn't tell which I liked more because I liked them both so much.\n\nThe main was a perfectly conceived and executed lamb dish.  Perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked.  I could order that dish a million times over.  \n\nDessert was a perfect ending to a perfect meal.  I ordered the strawberry filo dessert and it was rich and flavorful.  \n\nLove this place!!!  Will be back for sure!", "author": "L K."}

I hadn't been back in almost a year so we decided a trip was long overdue...\n\nFirst, you MUST try the \"Pepo\" cocktail.  Now in my 42 years, I've had thousands of cocktails and I can honestly say this was the absolute top of the list.  Who would have thought yellow watermelon and gin would go together so well?  add a little elderflower syrup and a sprig of opal basil and the combination is nothing less than Magic!  Truly refreshing.\n\nWe started with the abolone, which I hadn't had in years.  You literally can't tell which is the mushroom and which is the abalone steak.  The green salsa is an outstanding accompaniment -- a slight fresh zing with an accompanying mellow yogurt underling.\n\nFor my main dish, I opted for the Hawaiin Walu.  The fish was perfectly grilled and atop a lovely assortment of beans (favas, cranberry) along with an unctuous bean \"mousseline\" as they called it, reminiscent of umami.  Just lovely.  I actually asked the waiter if it had been poached in butter -- it was that moist and delicate yet rich but not overpoweringly so.\n\nIf you want an outstanding meal that is consummable (i.e., not over-the-top rich to the point that you can't eat more than one bite and here I think of Danko, Fleur de Lys {no offense to you chefs but I am easily put off by too much truffle oil and cloying rich sauces} definitely go to Boulevard.  It is top quality food served in top quality fashion without all the unnecessary fanfare.  Staff provide perfect service with a smile.  5 stars well worth it.", "author": "Brenda F."}

The service is very friendly from each and everyone working there, I enjoyed the nice historic decor and really love nice, relaxed ambiance. Our dinner reservations were delayed  for some reason and we had to waiting for about 10 minutes, but it was worth the wait since my dinning companion and I got one of the best tables on the house.\n\nNow, lets talk about food. I found some of the appetizer portions a bit small such one of their signature dishes AHI TUNA: TARTARE & SASHIMI Tartare with Lime- Sansho Aioli, Wasabi Tobiko, Furikake Chip Sashimi Dressed with Soy & Sake, Shiitakes, Shiso, Crispy Rice 17.50 My dinning companion opted for the BRUIN FARM HEIRLOOM TOMATOES & ITALIAN BUFALA MOZZARELLA Toasted Spring Onions & Basil, Endive & Upland Cress, Olive Oil Vinaigrette 14.75, this was good too. For our main courses we had LAMB T-BONE (DIXON, CA)WOOD OVEN ROASTED ON THE BONE WITH ROSEMARY, THYME, MINT & GARLICSERVED OFF THE BONES quash Blossom Stuffed with Crushed Yukon Gold Potatoes, Mascarpone Cheese & Amaranth Greens Local Asparagus, Green Olive Salsa Verde & Roasted Lamb Jus 34.50 \" Delicious!! and we also tried/shared another of their signature dishes: CALIFORNIA SQUAB &TOLENAS FARMS QUAIL PAN ROASTED WITH GARLIC & THYME Fig & Red Wine Risotto, Roasted Scarlet & Tokyo Turnips Fresh Figs, Red Walnuts & Pancetta with Barolo & Honey Vinaigrette Foie Gras Sauce & Quail Jus 29.75 quite tasty...

I tried to get a certain someone to take me for some sort of special occasion, and it seemed like this weekend just happened to be it.\nWe wandered over from Hotel Vitale (swoon), just to escape our claustrophobicly amazing suite with large patio and fantastic views. (this is sarcasm; but we did feel like getting out)\nWe didn't have reservations, and at 9:30 all the tables were still full.  Luckily we nabbed the last two seats at the dropped down section of the bar.  Sandwiched between two service wells, this is not prime real estate, but it worked for us.  Our bartender/server was great - a little aloof initially (we'll call it \"cooly professional\"), but fast, friendly, and kept a great beat with his Boston shaker.\nWe started with a couple of cocktails while we decided what we were going to sell our kidneys for.  We decided on three apps - the ahi tartare, the scallops, and the goat cheese and beet ravioli.  The ravioli were the first thing to catch my eye on the menu (I swear, I have goat cheese radar), but were my least favorite in practice.  The seafood was fab and beautifully plated.  A couple more drinks, some more yummy bread and we were stuffed.\nNot a bargain meal by any means, but I'm so thrilled I finally made it in.  I will be honest that while I enjoyed the food, it was not the best meal I've had in SF and I probably won't be rushing back even though I absolutely adored the vibe and ambiance inside.  \nOkay, maybe for dessert.  We didn't have enough room, but they all sounded amazing.\nOr if I can figure out how to steal some of those cool, whimsical, Alice in Metroland light flxtures. . .", "author": "Jennifer D."}

The bar tender (tall, bald guy) was NOT very friendly at all, and was not exactly outgoing or fun, he had a crappy attitude and made me not want to be there (and I was the only one at the bar,  does he get it????) . I asked to see the selection for a GLASS OF WINE and He gave me a wine menu with only bottles on it and kept saying the selection was on the first page, however, after several more questions he realizes at my pointing out that in fact the page was MISSING from the book. DUH. So I ordered my $18.00 glass of wine and was not able to transfer it to the table, like I dont know a NORMAL GOOD restaurant does. So I thought to myself, not great so far but lets see...\n\nWe had lunch, I had a $14.00 boiled egg (63degrees for 45 minutes with polenta, very good but its an EGG - FOURTEEN DOLLARS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?) and the farm raised chicken. I actually thought our waiter was very good and very attentive, but he did mess up my friends order and lunch took about 45 minutes (THIS IS A BUSINESS LUNCH PEOPLE). My chicken was basically 1 piece of fried dark meat (thigh) and 1 piece of white meat which I thought was very weird. The fried piece was NOT GOOD, KFC is 10x better, and the other piece was okay. All told, I was disappointed, and would recommend against going to this restaurant. The asshole bartender stood out I must say, everyone else was SUPER nice and cordial like you would expect at BLVD.  My friend ordered the ravioli's which were just delicious, my other friend ordered just a salad. So I would say 3 out of 10 - but in this economy why anyone would come here is beyond me, another SF institution that eventually ends up with their heads up their asses.", "author": "John j."}

So I had a 1st date with a young lady I recently met and she worked nearby, yada yada - Boulevard. So we have 5:30PM reservations that they called to confirm 2 days prior. We get there at 5:25PM and they're still setting tables. The hostess shuffles us off to the bar for drinks, which seems mildly like a ploy to juice us, but whatever.\n\nThe drink waitress seemed indifferent an like she was trying to rush us. I noticed after 20 minutes a lot of tables are starting fill up. So I ask the hostess what's up - we have 5:30PM party of 2, which we confirmed as soon as we walked in. She says I thought your party was incomplete. I said, \"We're a party of 2. She was standing right next to me when we check ed in.\" She has someone take us to a table 1/2 way into the restaurant to a small table across from the kitchen. It reeks of gas and people kept getting seated across from us even closer to the kitchen then bailing out for another table (3 times). \n\nSo the waiter, a bald guy also with no smile, gives us our menus. The portions were embarrassingly small. My date's rice bed under her tiny salmon portion wasn't even hot and was under cooked. I asked the waiter if he could take it back and have it re-bedded on hot, cooked rice. He offered to bring a side of the rice. It was steaming hot and had small nuts that the original one didn't. My lamb was fine, but also seemed like a tiny portion. The calamari appetizer was also not very generous. 2 bites each for 2 people for $17. Decent, but an organsm in my mouth, it wasn't. \n\nYou'd think for $100 for 2 people without any alcohol at all, the staff could preform like they had been doing this for more than a week, act surprised to hear food was poorly prepared, muster a smile and pretend they wanted to be there 1 day before Thanksgiving. \n\nAlso, to the asian guy who just popped in to scrape the crumbs off the table - if you've had no contact with the table prior to that moment, just popping in and aggressively scrapping crumbs without so much as an acknowledgement or a \"pardon me sir\" when both of us are leaning forward on the table chatting - it's a little intrusive and coarse.\n\nI've also eaten at Hawthorne Lane, Aqua, Crustacean and back in the day - Sol y Luna & Arianna/Blue Fox and I'd take any of them over this place that's supposed to be in the top 2 or 3 restaurants in SF. When the decor and valet are the highlights of the experience, it's time to move on down the list and leave this one in the rear view mirror.

The tables are a bit close to each other, but the noise level isnt terrible. Still, not the best for holding hands and gazing into each others eyes, when theres a table a few feet away. The service was excellent. Im youngish and the crowd is quite a bit older, so I normally expect to be condescended to and frowned upon (as I have at Hawthorne Lane). Not so here, everyone was polite and courteous and very helpful, since my girlfriend is very indecisive the waiter was more than happy to suggest both an entree and dessert, both which she was very happy with. The food was very good, but not astounding. Sauces tend to be a bit heavy or overdone. Good though, I think thats just my personal taste talking. The fish was a bit overdone, I like my salmon as rare as possible, and although many places can cook a nice rare steak, a nice rare fish is harder to come by. We had some fruit flavored iced teas (too much drinking during the night before!) which were very tasty. Dessert was presented nicely and was light and refreshing. There were definitely more entree and dessert items that I would have liked to try. I think we had crab cakes for an appetizer which were decent, not that great. My main problem with Boulevard is that its way overpriced, the food is comparable to Dine or many other places, nothing that really stood out. But if you dont mind paying for the nice decor and atmosphere, and want an upscale place, then I guess its OK. I probably wont be going back though, but it was good to try once. Just dont go because you want astounding food.\r\n\r\nPros\r\nVery nice atmosphere, great service, good food\r\n\r\nCons\r\nOverpriced and overhyped!\r\n\r\nThe Bottom Line\r\nVery good food, but not astounding.

I wondered that last night about Boulevard.\n\nTHE FOOD\nThe scallop appetizer had three lovely scallops, perfectly cooked, and started us off on a good note. \n\nThe four little gnocchi that followed were as flat as their flavor and the rabbit loin wrapped in pancetta tasted like the flavors had melded too long - an odd hammy taste overwhelmed. My companion commented that it was almost like a hot dog. \n\nMy companion's filet mignon was ordered medium but came rare and with a heavy hand on the cheesy topping - the taste evoking of all things a blue cheese burger. She was unhappy not only with the rawness but the chewiness as well. \n\nMy lamb was excellent but the waiter insisted that I order it medium instead of the medium rare I initially requested. I let him prevail but really, shouldn't I have it the way I want it? The greens that accompanied it were too bitter to complement the sweetness of the lamb.\n\nThe chocolate cake was oddly dry - hard to do with a flourless cake. It made me wonder about its age. The root beer part of the root beer float ice cream was almost a granita and seemed almost drained of its root beer color and flavor. The foam was tasteless. Only the little tuile of chocolate cookie and a cute little of spiral of spun sugar brought the whole dessert above absolutely pedestrian.\n\nMy companion and I both agreed - the whole meal tasted like a hotel dinner - in another city. \n\nTHE SERVICE\nOdd gaffes abounded. We were nicely greeted and the hostess gathered menus and napkins and then started to walk us to our table when she abruptly stopped, put down the menus etc. and greeted the people behind us. She then checked in two groups before she got back to us again, leading us to stand awkwardly wondering what was happening.\n\nWe did have a 5:45 reservation and I know restaurants like to flip tables but the person busing our table took away our wine glasses when they were empty without asking us whether we wanted a refill or saying anything at all. He just darted in his arm and sped off faster than a seagull nabbing a French fry. I eat quickly and surrendered my plate a bit before my companion was finished with her entr\u00e9e. The bus person starting asking her if she was finished as soon as she was half done with the filet. Sigh. She finally let him have it when she was about three quarters done. Maybe there were orphan children in the kitchen.\n\nThe waiter was fine, attentive at first, but less so as time went on (not asking about more wine), an average experience. \n\nTo be honest, I don't think we'll return.", "author": "Ann L."}

I may have a meeting with a client (or two) in the middle of the afternoon or the rest of the day is mine. Either way, I always have time to lunch and most times rather well. I do not have kids and my dogs' dietary requirements, do not decree an exorbitant amount of funding for her less then sophisticated palette. \n     That being said, I spend quite the sum on dining out and trust me, you are going to need a small fortune to dine well at this establishment. If you save your ducats, this experience is well worth it. Well prepared fare, a fully stocked bar, a more than sufficiently stocked wine selection and fantastic service will channel you into consumption comatose. That's not a bad thing. It's the cash coma you want to be leery of. I find one way of hurdling this obstacle, is to intake at these high-end restaurants during the lunch hours. The price-points on both appetizers and entrees are not as steep, the restaurant is not so \"stuffy\"and you have the rest of the day to enjoy. I feel you leave here more then satisfied, knowing that you have dined well and at (not quite) a fraction of the cost. \n     If you can't get out for lunch and supper time is your only option. Then may I suggest ordering a few of the appetizers. That way you know they are going to be small plates/portions but you get grazing options. Trust me, you leave on such a different level when you feel that you got what you paid for. Plus, you get to sample a cross section of what the restaurant has to offer, giving you more insight to the whole dining experience.

It was so delicious. We were full, but we still ordered some fruit and cheese as a dessert, and even that was tasty even though we were so full!

Then had the butter lettuce salad with something something tomatoes and avocado. Everything there was divine. I wish I could make simple salads taste so good at home! There was something about the avocado, it was chopped and laid on the tomato slices and it was kind of extra tasty and flavorful. I don't know, but it was GOOD. then, main was the sea bass with risotto and ham hocks and again... something something. This was beyond. Again, I only wish I could make fish that tender and flaky (Alton Brown swears this is a misnomer... nothing can be tender yet flaky. But this was!) and the risotto was just perfect, flavored with the ham. Yum. Then the dessert was the Caramel Chocolate ganache. So good, I did not even sweeten my coffee. We ended up splitting this because my boss wanted to take her dessert home to her son. Ok with me! It was so rich, I could have finished it but been sick afterwards. Attentive with the coffee refills too - that deserves extra credit in my book. It was a little loud towards the end of the meal (we had 5:45 reservations, so there was literally no one there when we sat down) but even still, food and service were excellent, so I could handle the loudness!

Overall good, but not wow.\nBad:The bread was too cold and not tasty for some reason.  The plain butter didn't help.  The scallops for appetizer or starter plate was not tasty and not cooked well enough. The inside was a bit fleshy, though I wasn't quite sure if this was meant to be.  Leaving it cooked for least another minute would of been perfect.  In addition, the scallops had very few sand grains.   The pork dish was quite a disappointment.  None of the pork items were tasty. Either the wine numbed my taste buds, or  the pork was just bland lacking flavor.  I was expecting the taste to be better than a Roasted Crispy Pork you get at a Chinese Restaurant. Both the scallop and pork were not fufilling.  Another disappointment was the ghetto walk to their restrooms.  You leave the restaurant through a door and suddenly the bouvelard experience stops. It was like being in the movie Narnia - going through the closet and you are in another world.  In this case it was a dark door and you entered what I thought  was a deserted haunted hotel lobby.   I was like - oh my gosh.  Then you travel downstairs to the loo and again very plain and boring.\n\nThe good: See,  I do have a  lot of good things to say.  Service-- the best so far from my dining experience.  Not stuffy service you find at upper end restaurants, everyone I encountered were professional, geniune, polite, and happy.  They even listened to my concerns of my meal without attidude.  \nThe desserts (chocolate cake and the apple t) were top notch.  Those dishes were beautiful, tasty, and not too sweet at all.  I was surprised after my disappointing dinner that the desserts were top notch IMHO.  \nThe presentation of the scallops and pork dishes were done nicely and well laid out on the dish.  The decor in the restaurant andthe  men's restroom was nicely done --very frenchy.\n\nOverall, despite my disappoinment with the food, the service and dessert made my decision to rank Boulevard 3.5.

First of all, the service is phenomenal.  I don't know how they do it, but they manage to be attentive without making it seem like they're hovering or interrupting conversation.  The atmosphere is romantic and stylish, but somehow very relaxed all in one.  It's quiet enough to have a conversation easily, but not overly quiet so you feel like the tables around you are listening to every word you say.  But enough about atmosphere, the food, ahh the food...  I have to admit that I love a well-put together meal.  Boulevard is on the bandwagon of nouveau California cuisine, which I must say, isn't the most original concept these days, but I still enjoy.  We shared the crab-stuffed calamari as an appetizer (I'm sorry, you had me at crab-stuffed), basically perfection.  I had halibut, the boy had the pork chop.  Both were amazing.  Just lovely dishes of simple food cooked perfectly and well-seasoned.  We couldn't decide on just one dessert, so we settled for two.  I chalk this up to one of the better decisions in my life.  Both were exquisite.  \n\nAll in all, just a fabulous meal at a fabulous place.  Impressive without being uptight.  A wonderful way to spend a romantic evening.

Maybe because of that it wasn't as juicy and flavorful as I'd like. The Halibut looked delicious, but it was just  OK. I tried both the berry apple crisp and the flourless choco cake, the crisp was impressive looking and was very comforting. The choco cake was a bit heavy after a large meal. Otherwise, it was like eating smooth powdery fudge. I may give this place another go and try their filet mignon next time. Overall, for the price, the food could have been a lot better.", "author": "Olivia A."}

We needed a four top, so I walked in by myself and apologized for walking in without a reservation. The woman at the desk was very kind, while another staffer rolled her eyes jokingly. I can't blame her, I was taking a risk. I explained the situation and she looked through the book, but no luck. I thanked her for her time and I started to walk away. She called me back and said that a table in the bar was about to become free. The bar tables are first come, first served. We waited outside for fifteen minutes, then we were given a window table on the bar side. The staff was wonderful and the food was out of this world. There are somethings you can't put a price on.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-11", "description": "Who should dine here:  People looking for a solid business meal (lunch or dinner) downtown; nice but serious atmosphere.  \n \n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n \nAmbience/atmosphere: 4 stars.  I love the decor at Boulevard, it is very classy, but the employees and the clientele can make it feel a little stuffy or rather serious.  The restaurant itself is beautiful.  Not the best place for a romantic date though.  Attire is a little more dressy, given the large % of suits there on expense accounts.  \n \nService: 3.5 stars.  The service at Boulevard is generally very good, but not great.  I think it is often because it can get very crowded, and the staff are generally not able to give you the total attention you get at say a Quince or Gary Danko.  This was my experience last time, it felt like at certain times during the meal they forgot we were even there.  But in general it is pretty good, and the staff is knowledgeable on the menu, and their sommelier is great and can give you great advice on the wine list (see below).\n \nFood: 4 stars. I would best describe the menu as French/Med. I used to think Boulevard had some of the best food in the city, not overall meal, just best food.  My last experience has caused me to change this a bit.  The food is really fantastic.  Just an example, last time I ordered the lamb done three ways.  Well my dish was cold, not warm, cold.  Like it had been sitting out for an hour.  But it was still so tasty I didn't bother to send it back, I can't imagine what it would have tasted like warm or hot.  The lamb was so perfectly cooked it melted in my mouth, and had very intense flavors that were nothing like the really earthy tastes sometimes found with lamb dishes.  The fish is generally a good choice here, I tried the butterfish last time and it was really fantastic.  Very rich, but extremely elegant.  For starters, tried the roasted butternut squash soup with Quail (a little disappointing) and the beef Carpaccio with fried oysters (great!).  The deserts here are very good, so save a little bit of room.\n \nWine: 4.5 stars.  Great wine list. Extensive, and fair pricing for a restaurant of this nature.  The by the glass list is great, however this part of the menu is a little overpriced, but at least they have good options.  I think Pinot goes best with the food here, especially the wines from Burgundy.  With the apps I would suggest a German Riesling.  But ask the sommelier after you choose your meal to make some suggestions in your price range.  \n \nOverall: 4 stars.  Great place to go with a client on a business meal/meeting.  Would I go there on a date or with some friends, probably not.  Great food, great wine, but a little too serious for a fun/causal night out.  If you are visiting SF and staying downtown, consider it an option, but not a priority.", "author": "Scott P."}

As a sidenote, I saw a lot of amex platinum being pulled out on surrounding tables so that should hopefully give you an idea of the cost.  I would highly recommend as an appetizer the bay scallops with lemongrass noodles.  The noodles tasted straight out of a thai dish and complemented the scallops perfectly which had a little bit of hot sauce attached to it.  The abalone was also very delicious and something not found on many menus.  For the main course, both the seabass and halibut are great choices.  The seabass comes with risotto below it and the halibut is paired with different types of beans and a crab stuffed calamari body.  Bottom line is that I do not think you can go wrong at this restaurant except maybe the desserts.  Maybe it is the fact that my expectations just kept increasing as the meal progressed, but the  mudslide dessert was not on par with the appetizers and main courses.

Then an appetizer of scallops was divine, though rather small.  I have to admit at this point I was a bit disgusted that they serve fois-gras and sweetbread.  That goes against my morals, and usually I won't frequent a restaurant that serves these dishes.  But anyway, moving on to entrees.  I had an *amazing* filet of escolar.  My mother had halibut that was equally delightful.  And my girlfriend, who is vegan, has nothing to choose from.  Luckily the chef prepared something special, which turned out to be couscous, green beans, and some other vegetable in little copper cups.  Cute, but really small and not that special.  After finishing, I was full, but could have eaten more.  The portions weren't quite big enough.  And I know what to expect from fancy restaurants...\n\nSo the bill came, and it was a whopper.

Boulevard's combined outstanding service, with amazingly tasty and creative food, in a beautiful, and slightly boisterous bistro type ambiance.  (I stress the 'slightly' part - picture mildly boisterous WASPs -- in suits).  And when I went in September of last year, Boulevard's was still all that.  \n\nBut two visits this year (February and then this week) show a real change.  The wait staff is younger, and while friendly, clearly not well trained.  (Waiters who ignore your table for 10-15 minutes and rarely, if ever, check back with you; bussers who refuse to bus your table until EVERY person is clearly done, so we all get to stare at dirty plates; and my personal favorite - bussers who stride up to your table, point at a dirty plate two places in and demand \"give that to me\".)  Worse, the food is just not as good.  While the menu reads fabulously (as always), the kitchen no longer seem to be able to execute.  It's as if a college team was being asked to fill in for a professional team -- they are certainly trying, but lacking the skills, things just are not working out well.\n\nI hope its a blip on the radar for a restaurant that has been able to maintain ridiculously high standards for so long.

I think it has to me felt like a spot for wealthy, salt and pepper haired, well-heeled, well-dressed adult adults.  Whenever I've strolled by and peeped into the windows in the past, this is the impression I've received.  Yesterday evening, after drinks at the Vitale bar, my friend and I decided to have a burger at Boulevard.  \n\nWe went through the revolving front door into a really beautiful, crowded restaurant.  It was much bigger than I thought it was, and it immediately felt to me like being in a bistro full of the after work metropolitan crowd rather than a formal, seriously weighty French restaurant.  The bar area was crowded, and the wait we were told was an hour.  We put ourselves down and walked around the block for twenty minutes.  A  table opened up facing the kitchen, which we took instantly.  I love watching the chefs do their thing, so it worked out fine.\n\nIt's visually just great in Boulevard, especially if you like art nouveau or art deco.  The lamps and lighting fixtures are all in this style, as well as the \"fencing\" around the various dining areas.  I particularly liked the ceiling in the front area.  it looks to be made of brick and it is sort of arched or vaulted, reminding me of Roman architecture.  Also, I liked the mosaic tile flooring around the bar, which is made of a bright orange reddish wood.  The place glowed in orange to me.\n\nExcellent food.  Fortunately, burgers are on the lunch menu, so we had to dive into what was on offer for dinner.  Hunter our waiter gave me a copy of last night's menu, I wanted to try everything on it.  Felt the same way about G. Danko's menu.  Last night, I started with the Organic figs, almonds & mad river goat cheese in an arugula & red lettuce salad with fig-balsamic jam vinaigrette.  It was a perfectly balanced appetizer, with just the right amounts of each ingredient.  The dressing was excellent.  In my dreams I make vinaigrette this great.  For my main, I chose the California Lamb T-bone from Dixon.  Wood oven roasted , stuffed with oven dried tomatoes, feta & eggplant.  Fingerling potatoes with feta cheese as one side.  Another side was a relish made from rosa bianca eggplant, pistachio, currant & nicoise olive.  Last side:  sauteed erbette chard w/lemon & butter, rosemary lamb jus.  All very delicious.  In particular, the lamb was tender & not too overwhelmingly browned or overcooked, the flavor combinations in the unusual relish was fun & interesting to my palette.  The sauteed chard was original and one of my favorites.  Overall, I was very pleased and satisfied and very full.  Oh, and the bread & butter are both awesome.\n\nEveryone mentions the black cod.  I must go back to try it.  It was my second choice last night.  My friend had the Berkshire Pork Chop.  I tried it & it was otherworldly in flavor.  I don't know how that roasted that piece of meat, but I have never in my life tasted a lowly port chop like that.  It was a sublime moment, just wonderful to eat.   Food experiences like these to my mind absolutely justify the money one spends in places like Boulevard of Chez Panisse.  A writer I read years ago described it as eternal moments.  I like that.", "author": "Roland C."}

I came here for my mom's birthday, and we started off with some champagne...so far so good. I had a pretty decent salad as an appetizer, nothing memorable though. \n\nWhen our main courses came (I got the steak, my mom got the sea bass), my mom asked me to try hers. I put it in my mouth and wanted to spit it out; not only was it completely dry and over salted. The host or sommelier or whatever came over to ask how our food was; I said mine was good (though it was quite underwhelming), and my mom said she was a little disappointed. The host asked what she wanted him to do about it, being rather aggressive and unprofessional. He offered to get her something else, and when she asked what he recommended, he very rudely said, \"well I always recommend the sea bass, so I can't really help you.\" We were both pretty uncomfortable at that point, so she just said thank you and that she was fine with what she had. Eventually our waiter came over, was very apologetic, and replaced her dish with something else (which she really enjoyed...thus the 2 stars instead of 1).\n\nThe meal came to about $200 for the two of us, and though I'm sure that's not their biggest check of the night, I would like the sommelier/host to at least pretend he cares about our dining experience. I think I can safely say I will never go back here again.", "author": "Em G."}

While the atmosphere is nice, the whole dinner experience left a LOT to be desired. First, the waiter was not very friendly and his service was slow. The appetizer we selected featured 3 rather small scallops for $19. When it came to the main course we relied on his recommendations since we had never dined there before. Since my wife wanted seafood, he recommended the salmon for her. I was undecided, but he couldn't stop raving about the Lamb and highly recommended I get it. Well, both dishes were a huge disappointment. The Salmon was average at best, and my Lamb was undercooked and not very appetizing! We didn't even bother with dessert. Maybe I wouldn't be so critical if the service were better and the prices more reasonable, but when you pay $150 for a dinner for two (without dessert) you expect MUCH better. About an hour later we were both hungry again and ordered a pizza in North Beach. This place does not live up to its reputation if you ask me!!", "author": "D H."}

In a city full of amazing restaurants (Gary Danko, Jardiniere, etc), Boulevard is incredibly overrated.  I've been there for lunch and dinner several times over a period of 10 years - have yet to be wowed by anything I tasted, and have never tasted anything that was worth the price they charged for it.  Okay service is a pleasant surprise - usually it's just plain awful.  Ambiance is lovely, but overall, it does not live up to the hype in any way ,shape, or form.", "author": "Maggie Z."}

For me, it is reminiscent of those grand-scale classic dining establishments in Paris or Vienna.  I would suggest avoiding lunch hours, as the restaurant is mostly filled by grayish corporate crowd and you can almost sense a tension in the air.  At night, it is a different story.  The quality of every dish is ranging from \"utmost perfection\" to just \"perfection\". My ultimate favorites are tartar tuna and carpaccio, crab salad with caviar, fillet mignon with sherry cream and duck breast.  I always wanted to find out who their Dessert Chef is, just want to meet this person!  Absolutely the most creative and best tasting desserts in town.  And then - the wine list, and the service!

After reading reviews and taking forever making up our mind, we decided Boulevard would be the place for our one special night out in the City. We got reservations at 9:45, which wasn't ideal, but not too late for a night out. As soon as we arrived we felt like our server just wanted to rush our table and get out of there. She was brief, and didn't tell us any specials. We each ordered a glass of wine, rather than splitting a bottle (it was almost 10 PM - we already had a head start!) and I got the feeling our server wrote us off as being cheap. We ordered the scallop appetizer. The scallops were tiny, and one was completely under done. My husband ordered the pork and I had the hen. The hen was better, we thought, but neither was very exciting or perfectly executed. We couldn't help but feel like we were the table that the fine dining experience forgot. Our server stopped by (more like drove by) once, when our appetizer first arrived. She didn't check in again, so we really had no opportunity to tell her about the undercooked scallop. When our entrees were finished and she asked if we wanted dessert, we had already given up hope for the memorable and delicious meal we had hoped for. We told her we weren't particularly interested in dessert because the rest of the meal was disappointing, and it was like we attacked her personally. She became very defensive and told us we should have \"waved her down\" as she was walking by. Seriously? Her reaction was totally unprofessional. She did take the scallop app off the bill, which was nice, but not what we were hoping for, and also brought us a free dessert. Consistent with the rest of the meal, the dessert was completely ho-hum. Overall, we were disappointed, and really had to try hard not to let the experience ruin our otherwise wonderful day in the City. We will not be back.", "author": "Lindsey E."}

The scallops melted in my mouth and were nothing short of the best prepared scallops I have ever tasted.  The hamhock that came with the scallops was well cooked and was a good contrast to the softness and subtlety of the scallops.  The mixed green salad came with pears, goat cheese, and candied walnuts.  These 4 flavors came together perfectly; it is very obvious that they only used the highest quality ingredients.\n\nWe ordered the pork tenderloin to follow.  This was similarly prepared fantastically and was full of flavor. \n\nWe ended with an apple-crumble like dessert (the exact name doesn't come to my mind).

Maybe my expectations were too high, but I wasn't overwhelmed by the glory that was supposed to be Boulevard.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor is gorgeous, but instead of sitting back, relaxing, and enjoying your surroundings, the atmosphere at Boulevard is loud and frantic.  The kitchen is exposed, which may provide entertainment for those sitting at the bar, but for the rest of us it just means 6 people in white jumping around.  There are no booths, just closely positioned tables.  You can hear a few other conversations and the waiters have to squeeze by each other.  You definitely get the feeling that this is not supposed to be a long, leisurely dinner.\n\nThe food was good.  I started out with the mozzarella and ricotta, and both cheeses were excellent.  My bf's tuna tartar was great, especially those carrots and their sauce, but at the same time I wasn't wowed.  Next I had the sea bass, and it was just a piece of plain, well cooked fish, but those mushrooms were pretty incredible.  My bf had the quail, which he said was really excellent and looked pretty awesome too.  For dessert I of course went chocolate, but the chocolate cake was dry, and that's quite disappointing.  The fudge on top was delicious (but all fudge is delicious) and the minty ice cream tasted like you were actually biting into frozen mint.  The strawberry vanilla tart was not my thing but my bf enjoyed it.\n\nOverall, I think that Boulevard may be better for a business lunch than a birthday dinner. The service was good, the food was good, the atmosphere was fine - I think you have to know what you're getting into beforehand.

Being one of the most booked restaurants in SF, I had high expectations.  I took my mom and friend here for dinner on a sat night.  Even with two weeks advance notice, our reservation options were 6:30 or 9:30, we opted for the earlier.  \n\nUpon arrival, we still had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though the place was not full.  The tables were cramped and I could not help but overhear the conversations next to us.  \n\nWe had a $150 gift card, so we ordered four apps, three entrees and shared a dessert.  For apps, we had the asparagus soup, crab stuffed calamari, ahi tuna tartar, and pheasant and mushroom ravioli.  The portions were laughably small...my mom actually LOLed when the food was served.  The soup was about one half of ladle's worth, in a bowl the size of a large dinner plate, with a few shavings of asparagus and ricotta dumplings.  The ricotta dumplings were delish, but the soup and asparagus tasted like air.  The pheasant and mushroom ravioli (we got three, so one for each of us) were wonderful and probably my favorite part of the meal.  I wish I could have had more than one bite.  The tuna and calamari were both fine, nothing extraordinary except for their portion size. \n\nFor entrees, I had the short rib, my mother had the carrot crusted halibut, and my friend had the sea bass.  I thought both of the fish entrees tasted bland, but that may have been because my beef was very flavorful.  The beef was in a dense sauce which my friend thought tasted BBQ-ish, but the beef was very tender and juicy, and I definitely thought it was the best entree out of the three.  \n\nFor dessert we shared the almond butter cake, which came with dark hot chocolate ice cream, raspberry sorbet, a toasted marshmallow and chocolate brittle.  The almond butter cake was basically a pound cake, but it was a great combination and I thought dessert was really nice presented.  \n\nOne star off for their glasses and silverware.  My friend was served his drink in a glass that had very large food pieces stuck to the inside, my mom's silverware was sticky when he sat down, and the table next to us was served their sparkling water in a dirty glass as well.  That's not a good sign when dirty dishes are all around you.  \n\nService was also sub par (but I recently dined at Gary Danko and really, no other service compares...).  They originally brought out the wrong entrees for our table, and it took awhile for us to get our food between the apps and entrees.  \n\nWith the food and non-alcoholic drinks, the bill came to about $200.  If I did not have the gift card, I would not have been a happy face.  I will probably return if I'm with someone who really wants to go, but this will not be a place I choose on my own.", "author": "Grace C."}

The meal was paced perfectly, everything was cooked perfectly, it was a moderate amount of food where you came away full but not stuffed or uncomfortable, every bite was a thrill to the taste buds, and the wine was fantastic.  We had the abalone appetizer, and we both laughed when they brought it out, as the single piece of abalone was about the size of a silver dollar; however, it was fantastically garlicky, and the other veggies and sauce on the plate rendered it wonderful.  Top standout of the meal was the filet mignon, which came with a blue cheese fritter - just try it, it was amazing.  We had key lime cheesecake for dessert, which came with a scoop of raspberry gelato (yum) and also a bit of margarita granitas, which honestly was a bit odd.  Each part of the dessert was yummy on its own, but I'm not quite sure why they put those things together on the plate.  However, we still enjoyed it.  \n\nAwesome ambiance - great place to people watch.  The restaurant has a lot of energy and verve to it.  You will come away energized.

I always say I'm going to get something different but I can never do it. When you find an awesome steak, you don' t want to pass it up in favor of trying some potentially bland hunk of meat.

The only low point is that I'm not rich enough to go more often and I've never really had a great dessert there. When I get to the last course it is usually dried out (brownie), ho hum (creme brulee), or tasteless (pumpkin ice cream).

From the service, wine list, and ultimately the food.  To start off, the waitress was constantly harassing us to order food, but vanished once the food arrived and was no where to be found when service was needed.  She did not know the wine list, and at first said that a particular type of wine was not available on the list, only to come back a few minutes later stating \"oh I lied, we have that\" pointing to a list of half a dozen wines.  She then reappeared again and was practically forcing us to finish our dinner and leave to make room for customers waiting at the bar for tables.  These folks did not look very happy waiting for such a protracted period of time to get a table and that made the place unfriendly.  The sonoma foie gras appetizer was good, but the shrimp was meh.  The main lamb was overpriced and there was no synergy in the ingredients.  It tasted as if someone wearing a blindfold randomly took ingredients and threw them in a frying pan.  It was not properly cook.  The menu had very limited choices for the main.  The dessert was, again, disappointing.  Very, very disappointing ...", "author": "Hood R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-17", "description": "Actually, Id have to give Boulevard 4-1/2 stars - if it was possible-based on our only experience. We are from the South Bay and rarely get up to San Francisco for dinner and actually didn't know much about Boulevards stellar reputation... we were simply looking for something decent to eat on a late Sunday afternoon before heading down 101 South.  \nThe three of us (our 19 year old son was with us) stumbled somewhat dazed and confused into Boulevard through a side entrance about 25 minutes before they officially opened for service and were, frankly, dressed rather casually  ( we found out by observing the normal crowd as they entered) But we were, nonetheless, warmly greeted by a pleasant Maitre d, who informed us that he'd be happy to check the reservation list to see if there were any cancellations... We thought... really... would this nearly empty restaurant be that booked up on a Sunday?  (the answer is YES)  Luckily, the Maitre d' informed us that they had an opening and he could seat us for dinner as soon the place opened. While waiting at a bar table, I thought he might be pulling our chain and while scanning the menu, my wife and I couldn't help but see that dinner was going to cost about double what we had planned to spend for the evening. The selections were enticing and we agreed - \"So what, let's give it a try\"  We were very glad we stayed.\nWithin a half hour of opening, Boulevard was packed and turning away all the drop ins.  We were seated at a nice table in the very center of the place. The atmosphere is very comfortable, but somewhat rustic for the high end cuisine. Our server was a very genuine and knowledgeable young woman who treated the three of us to spectacular, unpretentious service. She was among the best servers we've encountered in a US establishment.\nI ordered the lamb and it was perfection and grace - the presentation was delightful.  My wife ordered a filet mignon and it was among the best she'd ever had. I sampled her filet and it was so tender and flavorful, I forgot about my lamb, for a moment.  Our son ordered a a halibut dish that featured a beautiful boneless filet grilled and delicately sauced as well as a squid tube stuffed with a halibut mousse which turned out to be the only dud of the evening. I noticed by his expression that our son didn't seem to care for it,  so both my wife and I sampled the dish. We both found it strangely bland and felt the squid tube was just a little waxy. On the plus side, all of the other side dishes were substantial and complimented each entree beautifully. The portions were ample, too.\nSince we were clearly going over our casual dining budget, we ordered two decent wines by the glass at reasonable cost and shared a single (generous sized) desert between us. Our server never pushed, rushed or tried to \"up sell\" any items. She was terrific, as were the other table staff.\nFor the food and service, Boulevard probably deserves a full five stars. However, I'm deducting 1/2 star for the slightly -less- than-stunning ambience, a \"so-so squid recipe\" and for the fact their menu did not offer a simple salad of mixed greens among numerous \"first course\" selections. There were several dishes (both warm and cold) that sounded fabulous, but we didn't want that much to eat and ,honestly, to add three more $16 to $20 starter items to our bill, but we would have gladly ordered a couple of small salads, even priced at ten dollars.  Sometimes you just want that simple, cool plate of greens.\nAll in all - Boulevard is a top notch dining experience - but don't take it for granted they'll have a cancellation and seat you on a moments notice - we were fortunate, but know that we should call way in advance, next time.", "author": "Stephen M."}

The two of us arrived without reservations about 12:30.  They were completely full but the counter was open at the kitchen.  We had a very enjoyable meal watching the cooking happen at an amazing speed.  At our arrival the cooking seemed to be at the busiest point of the meal.  \n\nBetween the two of us we had a glass of white, two vodka martinis, an amazing appetizer of buffalo carpaccio with black truffle, a nicely-done scallop dish and crab louis plus coffee at the end of the meal.  Total price was $95 plus tip.\n\nOnce again service was professional, smooth, helpful yet unobtrusive.  It was the highlight of the 3 meals we packed into 24 hours in SF.  The menu looked completely changed since April.  I would gladly return here again and again.\n\n---\n4/29/07\nIt's been around for a long time and now I can understand why!  We went for lunch on Friday and thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Something about the interior was very relaxing and attractive.  The curved brick ceiling made it feel like a basement restaurant in Europe but the entire wall of windows along Mission and Embarcadero kept the room light.  \n\nWe shared a sand dab stuffed with lobster to start and then a pork tenderloin dish with cheddar mashed potatoes and greens.  A huge portion of the lunch menu had fish as an entree choice and I did not feel like two fish dishes.  \"E\" had paella with guinea hen.  All of the food was absolutely delicious, with great texture, flavor and presentation.  I had two sizable glasses of a white wine, I believe it was Bordeaux Blanc, Chateau Haut Rian, which the waiter recommended as a pair for both my dishes.  We would have tried dessert but just couldn't manage to eat more food at the moment.  \n\nI would gladly go back in a heartbeat!  Lunch came to $100, (I believe that was before tip).

I had hopes of a quiet romantic evening and when I first walked in my hopes were dashed.  I was initially put off by the valet who didn't exactly rush or even saunter to take our car, it was as if he wanted us to beg to park our car.  Then he informs us \"it's $10\".  Ok, I say, he just stares, oh, you want my money now?  Then we walk in and it is so loud inside.  The host was luke warm and informs us that our table is not ready.  I think if you make it so difficult to have a reservation on a Thursday night that my table should be ready at the time of my reservation.  Isn't that the point of a reservation, so you don't have to wait at the bar for 20 minutes?  \nOk, I will get to the good stuff now.  Once we sat down I was feeling relieved.  The view was spectacular and our waiter exceeding my expectations. Brett was attentive and informed but never intrusive.  The food was great, All the food was delicious, but I have to rave about the chocolate cake, if you can call it cake.  We ordered desserts that in no way resembled the written description, but who cares when something is so delicious.

The manager ( I think his name was Andrew?) or that was the waiter's name, one or the other, anyway he was very helpful and friendly, took care of a minor problem very professionally. Our busboy Emiliano was amazing! Rarely does a bus boy make such an impression.

I was very disappointed in the dress of several patrons - shorts, \"I love SF\" t-shirts and dirty sneakers.  Obviously they don't enforce any dress code whatsoever.  That was a big disappointment.  They are just interested in filling seats.  Many patrons, however,  were beautifully dressed.  I also don't care for leaving the restaurant and going down an elevator to the restrooms.

After stopping in here for lunch today, I'm not surprised Boulevard is a James Beard finalist for Outstanding Restaurant. This elegant but down-to-earth fine dining spot, which in the early afternoon felt like a bustling Golden Age cafe, really was *that* good. I started with the Organic Little Gem Lettuce salad, which is a mix of Parmigiano Reggiano, Rosso del Bruno tomato relish, Olio Nuovo and shaved Parmesan. It's dressed with both a creamy buttermilk dressing on the bottom and a balsamic vinaigrette on top, and the blend of flavors is positively sublime. For an entree, at the server's recommendation, I went with the wild caught and pan-seared Day Boat Sea Scallops, which were clean, perfectly textured and served with a ridiculously creative celery root and parsley potato \"ravioli\" atop a bed of wilted spinach. The whole thing is dressed with truffle and celery root relish as well as beurre blanc. It's just flat-out heavenly.

The hostess asked to give her a few minutes.  Before the minute was up, she had a nice table by the window available.  The decor reminds me of the high-class, turn-of-the-century, dining establishments of yesteryear.  Very rich and classy.  The wait staff was fairly attentive.  I didn't think they were stuffy.  The food was served fairly quickly too.  We probably waited no more than 15 min from the time our waiter took our order.  Now, there's no denying that the food is excellent here.  I savored every bite of my tender veal..every bit of the 2\" diameter loin cut.  You had to chew it slowly to really enjoy it.  Eat too fast and that was it...no more, all gone.  Call me unrefined, but this is really not my idea of dinner.  I prefer to think of their portions as appetizers.  Their prices really are not justified.  It's a nice place for a special date or to impress clients.

The first time was a few years ago for a client dinner and I was super impressed, everything was delicious.  This time went on a date and even though we had a reservation had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated.  At the end of the night,  to be perffectly honest I was underwhelmed.  Felt it was a bit pretentious and not as excellent as it should be considering the prices.  I had the sushi roll which tasted good but was not superb.  The lamb was my main course and it was ok but I think there are other places I would go before coming back here again.", "author": "Melanie -."}

Go to Boulevard, sit at the bar and have a great dinner with your girlfriend, chat with the bartender, watch the servers, get right into the thick of the night time crowd without sitting at a more formal dining table (available by calling well in advance).

(the exclamation pt ! is their addition, not mine).  you must order these with excitement, due to the puncuation.  other people got some some chocolate thing and some strawberry thing.  the bite i had of each was delicious.  in fact so delicious, that my friends wrote a letter (not an email, but a real snail mail letter) to the pastry chef telling her she changed their lives!  their lives were quite boring (and still are after the change inducing desserts), so it doesn't take a lot to change it, but still the sentiment should be appreciate.\n\ni highly recommend going to boulevard.", "author": "scott w."}

Even the drinks from the bar! I started off with the pear bellini and my friend had the elderflower tart and after tasting hers, i was so jealous so i had many of those for the rest of the nite... it was so yummy.  I'm glad I came with my fiancee and best friend because I got to try more dishes.  We all got different things and tasted each others dishes.  For appetizers we had the Dungeness Crab Salad, the Ribeye Carpaccio and the Stuffed Monterey Calamari.  For our main dishes we had the Sea Bass, the Prime Rib Pork Chop and the Filet Mignon.  There were no complaints whatsoever about the food.  We even finished it off with desserts.  We shared the yummy cream puffs and the truffle cake. We got there before the restaurant had even started seating people because the only reservations they had for the night were the 5:30 ones.  But I'm glad we took that reservation because we still got out of the restaurant at 8:00 so it was a perfect time for dinner.  The restaurant had filled up pretty well right after we were seated too.  I want to go back already, but I cant afford to for awhile, lol :P", "author": "Kymberli C."}

A little unnerving at first, but they are there to make sure your experience is first class, so don't be surprised if they make you feel pampered. My first night there was with a bunch of friends in college, probably 8 or 9 of us, and none of us had had a dinner that was that expensive before. Determined to make the most out of the fact that we were about to blow more than a $1000 on drinks and food, we shared every single dish we ordered and kept the wine flowing. WOW. Every appetizer wonderful, every entree lip-smackingly good, every dessert a work of art to the eye and the mouth, Each of us swore that every one else's dish tasted better than our own, and we left the evening with one of the peak dining experiences of our lives. Now I take my mom there every mother's day and go there to celebrate a special occasion. Always worth the trip and the megabucks.", "author": "jeffrey m."}

Thankfully, I blended in.  Ordered the organic beet salad to start and then had the guinea hen which was prepared with a type of pasta (can't remember which kind), red spinach (never knew there was a red spinach, but okay), and a hazelnut pesto.  Hellooooo!  I'm all for the hazelnut.  Love the hazelnut.  So, naturally I had to try the hazelnut pesto.  Gawd it was goooood!!!!!!.  The whole thing.  Never had a guinea hen and had never heard of it, but I would have to say it's a little gamier than but not very different from the chicken.  The atmosphere was lovely and the staff friendly though our waiter was not that attentive.  Which is why I gave it four stars.  Perusing over the menu I couldn't help but notice that there really aren't many choices for the vegetarian/vegans.  I'm not one of them but have friends who are so am always looking for places where we can all dine together.   This wouldn't be one.   Although I enjoyed my meal, I wasn't really bowled over by anything, in the sense that I didn't feel they were doing anything that other restaurants weren't.  Perhaps if we had desert I may have been.  But we were far too full to eat anymore.   It was an experience, a good one overall.", "author": "Magdalena .."}

I had called ahead to have some roses delivered to our table, and sure enough they were there as we sat down.  Huge kudos for how accomadating they were and how easy it was.  Everyone from the Maitre'd to the Busser to the Waiter were amazing to us.  They made us feel like a million bucks and made an already special evening even more unforgettable.  Now onto the food:  We had a glass of champagne with our appetizers of Tuna Tartare and organic Heirloom Tomatoes.  Delicious.  I particularly liked the addition of watermelon with the Tuna.. the tastes complimented each other quite nicely.  Following this, our waiter recommended a fantastic bottle of wine to go with the Lobster my fiancee ordered, and the Filet Mignon which I had.  Everything was cooked to perfection.  I used to think that a steak I had at Mastro's in Scottsdale was the best I'd ever had, until now.  It literally melted in my mouth.. unreal.  Also, the flavor of the beef was very pronounced.  I'm not a fan of strong sauces or wine butters that usually accompany a steak and, in my opinion, take away from the flavor of the beef, and there was no such problem here.  It was the best filet i've had to date.  Finally, our dessert included a small chocolate sign that said \"Congratulations\" on it.  I never even asked for something like this, and they went ahead and surprised us with it.  Just A+ service in my opinion.  It was truly a night we'll never forget and everything from the decor, to the food, to *especially* the service helped make it so.

The only complaint is that I have sometimes recieved lukewarm food.  I know its a busy restaurant but they should figure out a way to not have to pick up 28 entrees at a time.

Went with someone who paid the whole bill for a table of 6 so no stress involved, although judging by the prices on the menu, they weren't all too bad when compared with other restaurants in the same class which I would say Boulevard is a card carrying \"A-class\" member.  Visit Boulevard for the architecture and lighting alone if for no other reason - incredible lamps, floor mosaics and brick ceilings to captivate your eye while trying to distinguish what perfect mix of spices/ingredients it took to create such flavor in your dish.  My dinner was about 3.5 stars though others at the table raved over their kobe bavette, fish dishes, prawns, scallops and even the cobb salad was a winner .  I had the stuffed pork chop which WAS a little over-cooked and gristly but the stuffing and flavor were tasty along with the accompanying mashed potatoes and sprout leaves.  The 4 diff. appetizers were all Delicious but sparse, especially for a table of 6;  I enjoyed the spinach stuffed oysters the best - perfection!  The best desert of the four we tried was the huckleberry tart with Meyer lemon sorbet - sweet!  A very extensive wine list kept us very happy and the service was \"out of your face\" and adequate though don't expect any real insightful answers to any questions regarding restaurant history or background on food items like whether something is organic or whether it's free range or sea safe fish, etc.  I will be back however, how could I not!

I definitely have to say that the appetizer stole the show! The quail was incredibly moist and the crispness of the bacon was a perfect contrast! For my entree I had the black cod with crab, lobster and artichokes. The dish was good, but a bit disappointing.

I was impressed that she came out though. I would say that this is a restaurant you come to enjoy really well prepared dishes. A very balanced establishment.

Everything was served at our seat, so we didn't really get up to mingle as much. The food however was delicious. There was a prechosen three course meal and two options for a starter, entree and dessert that we could choose from. I had  crab arugula salad with pears, good but a little bitter (from the arugula). My main course was chicken with mashed potatoes and spinach which was pretty good. For dessert I had a pear cobbler thing that was pretty tasty.

Its convenient location and great views make for a Paris brasserie parked at the end of Mission.   If you arrive when it is busy, the tables in the bar can be requested to be pulled together for a party of 4 and you can short cut the wait in the main restaurant.  The stuffed chop, sea bass and desserts were memorable and had my parents reminiscing about their time in the city forty years ago when they were first married.   Everyone at our table and the tables around us visibly enjoyed their meals, with the exception of a sand dab appetizer that we passed on, and the table next to ours barely touched.  Getting to and from the bathrooms is a bit of an adventure, but became a silly joke as each diner ultimately experienced the trek.

(mapanghi is what i told my husband). \n\n\ni tried his short ribs and wasn't thrilled about it either. the only part of my dish that i enjoyed was the 3 pieces of gnocchi on my plate and one lonely stuffed mushroom. neither of us finished our entree but i was very pleased with waiter's suggestion of riesling to go with my entree, and an italian red wine (a nebbiolo and barbera varietal) called bricco manzoni that paired so well with paul's dish. since paul doesn't really drink, i finished both glasses but was craving more of that red wine. i'm not really a fan of rieslings since i like my wines more dry. the riesling is too sweet for my taste but it was good nonetheless. but again, the bricco is just heaven! i will look for this wine and buy some to enjoy at home. \n\nlike the wines we had, the dessert was also excellent. we shared the sticky toffee pudding with a caramel custard top.  this was a great finish to an otherwise mediocre dinner. the custard wasn't too sweet, the biscotti was great. the ice cream had a hint of lavander that made you go, 'hmmm, i feel like i'm eating flowers!' and the candied kumquats are like candied calamansi minus the tartness.\n\noverall, i give boulevard a 2 out of 5 stars the excellent wine list, the great dessert, and the excellent wait staff (except for the hostess). it was good that we only had to pay an extra $30 for our dinner because of our gift card. i wouldn't come back to this restaurant if i had a choice. i would rather walk the extra 50 feet and dine at ozumo's (will post this review next time) where i am guaranteed to enjoy each bite of whatever i decide to get. \n\nparking is 10 bucks.\n\nsummary: 2 stars out of 5; bad hostess, excellent waiters; excellent wine and dessert.", "author": "Almira C."}

By 8:30 we had for first food - a\" bite\", and a drink. Each course takes about 30 to 40 minutes. The place was packed.  The kitchen staff all seems to be overworked and busy. The waiter did apologize for not being able to honor our reservation. Each course was delivered by a new person.  The food was great and the ingredients first class. The restaurant management is a disaster and we would not go back for that reason..The frois grois  is really good and for dessert I had a bon bon that was sthe size of an averagel colcolate. The pork chop is rather ordinary, the ahi great. Too bad they can't get it all together. They would make more money if they could turn a table in less than 2 hours on a wed. night. I must say the architecture- brick ceiling, peacock design in th floor, the Christmas Decorations and wreaths were fabulous and made up for some of the wait time. Was it the parivate party downstairs that messed up the whole restaurant... who knows. They need help in the management part.

I was there for my birthday last weekend and was so excited to finally go to the place after living in the city for 13 years.  When I walked in it was so beautiful and warm.  I was so excited.  Much to my surprise I found the food to be mediocre if we're going to compare it to other high quality restaurants in the city.  I got the sole which was over cooked.  The calamari was tough and the desserts were also unbalanced.  Though others at my table raved over the tuna tartare, I found it to be tuna subpar.  The server was young and immature and actually made faces to other servers as she walked away.  I don't think we were high maintenance - just like any other foodie in the city.  The busboy dropped silverware all over my friend and just smiled.  In general, the service acted as if 'the food will cover us.'  'our reputation will cover us.'  'our decor will cover us.' 'our chef's name will cover us.'  well, unfortunately, it did not at all in my book.  thank you Michelin for not including Boulevards.  perhaps your choices were not just editorial mishaps.", "author": "Lori m."}

Went here last night with my wonderful other for our 5th year anniversary and was totally blown away by the service, the wine, and the food. The fried farm egg with the buffalo carpaccio was impossibly exquisite. The softshell crab and ahi tuna tartare were outstanding and the calamari rockefeller was the best twist on two standards (oysters r. and fried calamari tenticles) that I've ever eaten. When each app arrived the server did an excellent job of describing all of the minute components, which made eating the food all the more memorable. We shared the filet mignon for an entree - superlative. Inside it was red, warm, and it cut like a cube of firm butter. It's accompaniments - trumpet mushrooms, spinach, and bacon wrapped potatoes (little ones) - fit like a tailored suit. I am lucky that my other eats small because I got her last two bites. For the finish they made our night extra special by sending out a little piece of chocolate with our desserts that read \"happy anniversary.\" Yes, it is a bit cheeseball, but sometimes it is better to over (rather than down) play certain milestones in one's life. And for this reason I couldn't be happier with our choice of restaurants for such an occasion. It is also nice when the service doesn't stop after you have paid the check - the doorman hailed us a cab, showed us out, and thanked us for our business. On a last note: if you are a person who describes a place like Blue Plate or Incanto as \"pricey\" this will certainly be out of your league. Prepare to spend and you will be rewarded (here as well as there).", "author": "pax r."}

Notably, the service by Tim is absolutely THE BEST.  Tim is a pro and you want him to be your best friend cause he's so personable.  However, our experiences with other staff members were surprisingly negative.  The bartender was actually rather rude, probably thinking he's funny.  He made sarcastic remarks that didn't end with a giggle but with a smirk.  We initially sat at the bar near cellar door and everytime it was opened a distinct smell of rubber (probably a fan) blew into the bar area.  Not good!  We finished our drinks and were nicely accommodated by the hostess for seats at the counter rather than our reserved table.  The place was actually pretty quiet but it was a Monday night.  We choose the counter because we love to watch the cooks AND that's where Tim the waiter-supreme works!   Tim showed up with menus and we reacquainted ourselves to him, talking about other restaurants and SF experiences he had suggested for my out-of-town friend's info.  We then faced the menus which listed the usual suspects.  Tim suggested the chicken and the pork.  I was primed for lobster because I don't cook it at home but was convinced to order the chicken.  My friend ordered the pork.  All of the first plates were the same as previously offered so we skipped that course, opting, we hoped, for a great dessert.  My friend ordered another glass of wine and I simply drank water as it was a school night (not a money issue).  Eventually the wonderful Acme bread and THE BEST butter in the world showed up and we chowed on that.  When our order came, the portions were fine but the SALT CONTENT WAS OVER THE TOP -- on BOTH plates!  The chicken looked skinny and was dry.  The chicken ravioli were way undercooked, a bit greasy, and the sauce was inedible.  And talk about inedible, the kale was like straw and dry and without even butter.  One bite was all I could possibly stand.  My friend liked the pork dish except for all the salt.  It was certainly beautifully cooked but spoiled by the \"seasoning.\"  And his kale (what a cheap side) was also sicko.  Oh, and his mashed potatoes tasted like they came directly from a box and had the consistency of GLUE!  They laid on the plate, a pale brownish-yellow, flat as could be!  So we were prepared to have dessert but when the menu came it was completely uninteresting.  I was hoping for their chocolate mousse but it was not offered.  So we went without.  I had a cup of their delicious coffee and my friend had a grappa that Tim suggested and it was excellent.  Needless to say, we mentioned the problems with salt, etc., to Tim and he immediately cleared our plates and ran to the kitchen to, no doubt, inform them of the problem.  The chefs, who were quite stiff and didn't converse politely with consumers, asked how we liked our meals and we told them the truth.  One said he would advise the back kitchen.  Our bill (2 entrees, 1 coffee, 2 glasses of wine and a grappa) came to $96.  We left Tim $30 tip (!!) and hurried out.  Will I go back?  Maybe not ... sadly, so.", "author": "Ted F."}

The dish was OK but i felt the cheese overpowered the sliced truffles. I also had my first experience with sweetbreads, Im still having trouble explaining them, but they were great, and I will always remeber BLVD for this aspect.
