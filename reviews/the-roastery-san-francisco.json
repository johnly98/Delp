The pesto sauce was delicious and the chicken was decent. The crepe was also served with a salad which wasn;t bad as well.\n\nThe drawback was that the crepe wasn't anything that really stood out, it was just a good enough meal that just happened to be well priced with Meal Pal, but I wouldn't pay $8+ for it.", "author": "Tyler T."}

I think The Roastery is okay and Boyfriend wants to burn them down. Here's why:\n\nHe ordered a Reuben Sandwich on rye. When we think Reuben, we think corned beef, melted cheese, toasted, and whatnot. Unfortunately, he received a few thin slices of corned beef, unmelted cheese, and white bread, not toasted. Needless to say, he was beyond disappointed. Then, there was a poor excuse of a side salad. I think his assessment is fair. But I had a different experience.\n\nThe Roastery has a variety of lovely bagels and crepes. Decently-priced for this area, I'd say. A few months back, I tried the Lox Crepe from my friend and I think it was okay. It's not on the Menu, but the lady said we can mix-and-match basically. Whatever you see on the Bagels section, you can request it as a crepe since they have the ingredients.\n\nRecently, I ordered the Nutella Crepe and it was STUFFED with Nutella that it was oozing out of the sides wherever I cut it! The crepe itself wasn't bad either. Maybe not crunchy, but not too chewy either. I'd be down to go back and try some more of their crepes.\n\nThey also have Breakfast Burritos, but I'm preeeeetty sure they're not self-made.\n\nSo, I'd stay away from the sandwiches, but have at their bagels and crepes!", "author": "Athena C."}

The owners are Eastern European I believe and so they also get all this awesome European candy like kinder and nestle chocolates we don't get here in the US.

The couches are comfy and the people who come and go are mostly friendly. The pictures on the walls are extremely worthy of conversation and lighting, color tones are relaxing. I love the breakfast sandwich and the breakfast burrito. I love that their mochas are strong. The girls that work here are cute. There are 2 stations of condiments, and a very large selection if beverage choices. I've been coming here for a while but routinely ordered the same things. Until this morning.\nCons:\nI ordered a crepe which came with a little salad and both shared a box. Salad was the best part but the dressing ran into the crepe and the crepe was mostly a crepe folded into itself with very little filling of what I really wanted; bacen egg and cheese. Really doughy. My tiny flimsy knife barely stood a chance at cutting as the box lids rubbed dressing on my fingers, until I tore them off. I felt like I was eating from a taco truck, which is fine when eating from a taco truck. \nThere aren't any student discounts. Across from AAU on 180 New Montgomery, you would think they would capitalize. $5 for a breakfast sandwich and a bottle of water will go a long way for those worried about student loans (not offered). Restroom needs more love. Toilet lid is wobbly, dirty floors and walls.\nOverall:\nI'll keep coming here because the mocha and the food is good, and the service is warming.

Frequently, it was too loud and obnoxious. We suffered through nearly an entire Britney Spears CD before someone had mercy and switched to Abba, with occasional Christmas carol breaks. Since we were there to visit and drink coffee, the variable volume and awful music made it difficult to hear each other.\n\nThen, around four-thirty or so, the staff began cleaning the place, which I thought was a bit odd, especially since the floor cleaner was very strongly scented. But no one said anything to us about them closing, and we were going off the website posted times (which indicated that they closed at nine). That is to say, we were not told until the female barista came over to wipe our table and said they were already closed, and we needed to go. Needless to say, that was the last straw. Though the coffee is quite good, the environment was so obnoxious and the communication so non-existent that I have no interest in subjecting myself to that again.", "author": "Tiana H."}

I ordered the Chicken Chipotle Sandwich from a very rude gentleman who seemed unhappy that I even decided to order anything. He spoke so quietly, and was upset when I asked him to repeat something. My classmate also paid note. He had ordered a Turkey sandwich. While eating, it seemed pretty good. The little salad that came with had an acidic balsamic dressing, but not quiet unbearable. Later that night, I woke up with serious stomach pain, and it progressed into vomiting into next day. I missed 2 days of work and of class. I sent my classmate a text, and he said he had diarrhea the next day. Will definitely not be here again, and will not recommend this place.

Then he gives me an odd silent treatment when I ask him why he would speak to me that way. Or, he tells me to leave if I'm on my cell phone even for 5 seconds. Where are we, kindergarten?

Okay, she must not have been in a good mood - so I went to talk to the man at the cash register. I politely explained that I had been waiting and had not received my drink yet. He offered me the double mocha that had been sitting on the counter that no one claimed. I did not want that - so I let him know I would like the single I ordered because I don't want as much caffeine as a double has. He literally rolled his eyes at me and then said a single would be coming out in a minute.

I ordered a cappucino...meaning I want espresso with a lot of FOAM.  I did not order a latte.  But what I received was a latte.  I guess I will be walking the extra two blocks to Peet's on the regular now since I can guarantee that I will get an actual cappucino there.", "author": "Whitney H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-09-05", "description": "Two stars for a terrible, acrid latte and a gloomy, slightly unfriendly atmosphere on both occasions that I've been to The Roastery. With so many nearby places to grab coffee and a quick breakfast, these guys might want to try a little harder.", "author": "Todd H."}

It's great when someone plays the piano or guitar. Wifi is always up and ready. Great panino. Longer hours would make for 5 stars", "author": "Brian F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-11-06", "description": "I find it quite hilarious how poorly disguised Cafe Trieste is as the Roastery. Their coffee is pretty good, although it suffers from the San Francisco trend of tasting slightly burnt, and it's slightly expensive. It's fun to sit outside here and people watch; Academy of Art is across the street and full of interesting art students.", "author": "Daniel C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-07", "description": "I used to frequent the Roastery every morning for coffee and a bagel when I was getting my masters at Academy of Art. Today I was craving a bagel with jam so I walked an extra four blocks to my old stomping grounds. I waited in line for 10 minutes (no one was in front of me, the baristas just pretended I wasn't there). I ordered my plain bagel toasted with cream cheese and jam and waited another 10 minutes for it to arrive at the counter. When my order was called, they got it wrong, making the bagel on wheat instead of plain. I kindly told the barista that I ordered plain and he argued saying I did not and that I should double check my order in the future. Not my job. Needless to say I'm very disappointed and won't be coming back anytime soon.", "author": "Gigi R."}

However, the atmosphere and the people make the place great. I have spent hours in here waiting for friends to get out of class at AAU and watched many owners come and go and yet to my delight they have all seemed to keep the big piano, great music, and friendly baristas. Free wifi is amazing always fast and their comfy furniture makes it easy to spend hours there. One of the best places to pass the time.", "author": "Carolyn N."}

I'll often get their veggie bagel before work. But it can be kind of annoying that they have a $3 min on credit cards.", "author": "Tim R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-16", "description": "they make a proper americano and espresso never tastes burnt. starbucks version tastes more like hot water than anything. pesto chicken panini is super yummy, bagels come with half a block of cream cheese which is otay with me :)   many of the reviews give it a bad rating for poor service , i cant say that has EVER happenned to me.   $3 min. for plastic.", "author": "Wei W."}

But I still don't like their coffee that much. Too roasted and over burnt, for me. Today, I ordered Espresso, surprisingly good! 4 stars for the Espresso with music, sunshine came through the window, and successful meeting worth to sit there for about 3 hours. The Espresso was smooth and works on me like a sec! Haha... don't make me wrong. It must be having normal amount of caffeine, well, maybe a bit more than normal in there for a regular coffee drinker, but for sure strong enough for the person like me maybe drink coffee twice a week, was super tired seconds ago. Anyway, at the same time when I asked for Espresso, since they have a $3 dollar min order required, I ordered a croissant with my ATM card. But when the bill came out, the Batista only charged for Espresso. I asked, \"does it include croissant?\" Maybe he forgot or maybe he's just being nice. \"Don't worry about it.\" He said.

Although its well after the lunch rush, it takes the rasta gentleman working the sandwich area a full five minutes to even start on my order.  So ten minutes later, I get my sandwich and head back to the office to eat.  I get all the way back, open up the bag and not only is there no mayo, the thing is drowned in mustard.  I return for a refund, receipt in hand with the words \"MAYO ONLY\" clearly printed on it in large type.  The pretty goth with face piercings  working the cash register shoots me a glare and asks if I want something else.  Well, no I don't have another ten minutes to wait for a sandwich as my lunch break is over.  She rolls her eyes, and hands me my money.  I stand there for a moment, waiting for her to say something.  When nothing comes, I ask, \"So I guess I'm not getting an apology?  She stares blankly at me so I leave, never to return.  Having read some of the other reviews, I have to ask, Who hires these rude people? In these rough economic times, couldn't the owners find people who are actually thankful to have a job?!?", "author": "Tony C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-09-08", "description": "My carmel frappe was merely ice blended milk with the very slightest hint of caramel. I didn't notice any coffee in it at all. And after I drank all of the milk out of the beverage, most of the cup still retained blended ice, so it was really just like drinking plain old milk. As far as their other items on the menu are concerned, I'm sure they are far superior, I was just disappointed to spend so much money on a milk snow cone that I could have made at home. So judging on this one single experience, it gets one star. Aside from that, nice people seem to work there as far as I could tell. The food looks delicious, and if I had more money I would go back and try that.", "author": "Dave N."}
