You don't go here for an incredible dining experience; you go to spend time with friends. It's almost always very easy to sit with a large group. Everyone lines up at the counter to order, then the meals are prepared quickly and typically arrive at the table in order. The staff is very nice and accommodating to substitutions. I've been coming here for years, and while there are occasional hiccups with orders, most of my experiences have been pleasant. The tortellini with firewood sauce is good, I also like the baked ziti.

The food is comparable to other fast casual joints like The Grove, but obviously can't compare to a fancy Michelin 1-star restaurant.  It's solid eating at a reasonable price.\n\nChicken Parmigiana: The chicken portion was decent.  Generally nice and crispy (though a few sections were overcooked).  Came with the right ratio of sauce and cheese on top of the chicken.  The capellini was a bit disappointing though.  Would have preferred it to be more al dente.  Also, they seemed a bit stingy with the sauce; the pasta only got a few drippings from red sauce falling off the chicken.\n\nSauteed Swiss Chard, White Beans and Pancetta: I'm not a  big vegetable side guy, but loved this.  Probably because there were ample cubes of crispy pancetta.  But also because the white beans made it feel hearty.  Way more exciting than just wilted greens.\n\nHoney-Dijon Chicken: Definitely ups the rotisserie chicken game by being drenched in a sticky and sweet honey-dijon glaze.  It's not quite Roli Roti good, but it sure beats Safeway.  The potatoes were decent, but paled in comparison the chicken.  The bread tasted stale and was generally uninteresting.", "author": "Adam B."}

The Castro is the most OUT section of San Francisco, and on your way there you too may see a group of men wearing nothing but flip flops and strategically-wrapped aluminum foil, walking down the street looking like they just swallowed a bottle of Viagra and are 15 minutes from the recommended \"call your doctor\" time frame expiring.  How this is legal I don't know, but it was far from out of place among the assorted other men, wearing the likes of studded leather vests or short shorts, as if a Village People convention was in town (which... I mean... maybe it was.  Maybe it is every day.  I don't know.).\n\nThat said, I went to the Firewood Cafe with a group of four.  We didn't have trouble finding a place to park on the street, and the restaurant wasn't overcrowded (though it was pretty full by the time we left).  I got the jambalaya special, and the other orders from my group included pork loin, sausage pizza, and grilled shrimp.  The food was good.  Absolutely no complaints about my jambalaya, or the bites I had of pizza and pork.  The vegetable sides were flat-out excellent.  \n\nI was confused as to whether this is a lunch counter-type of restaurant or a sit-and-wait type of restaurant, as you have to line up at the register to order, but then your food is brought out and staff are busily bussing tables and refilling drinks.  I rather wish it was one or the other.  My understanding is that they also do take-out, and I suppose if I had done that, then my confusion about the service model and my aversion to bringing my kids here would be set aside in favor of just enjoying the food.", "author": "Jeff T."}

Both are very good. \nThere are only 3 salad options (Ceasar, Kale and Garden,  I believe is the 3rd choice) and they come with 3 toppings for a base price. Then you can add on a meat and more toppings for add'l price.  So by time I finished with my salad order my price went from $10.95 to about & 17.95.  I added the salmon which about $6-7 more I believe. And an extra side. So by time tax, tag and title was added it was almost $20 salad.. But it was so worth it.. The portion is very generous and it was down right delish! So that was my first time there.  \nMy second time there (this past time when I checked in) I got the wood oven Salmon dish with Swiss chard and roasted potatoes.. All I can say is mmm mmm good! The Swiss chard is saut\u00e9ed and has white beans and onions and big bacon bits, which I didn't realize cause I don't really eat pork, (except bacon sometimes.. Lol) so ate a few and moved most of them to the side. And the potatoes are seasoned to perfection.. \nI came with 2 friends,  one that introduced me to the place and a coworker. One friend had a Kale salad with salmon and my other friend had a type of jambalaya dish, and each enjoyed their meal tremendously.

My fianc\u00e9 and I finished up with our dinner at Takara Sushi and walked straight in here after we saw the number of people eating and looking like they enjoyed their meal. We were miserable and felt like we need something more satisfying. So we added more quarters to our meter and walked right in. \n\nImmediately, the staff greeted us and told us about their Specials. Their menu board is big and extensive from pizzas, pastas, to sides, and kid's menu. I almost got lost reading every word on that board and to find out they have a Specials menu almost made me faint. It took my fianc\u00e9 a few minutes of calling my name before I was brought back to reality. I ended up ordering a Margherita pizza and a Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. I know, it is so generic but my stomach was not up to eating anything complicated or gourmet for that matter. We wanted simple comfort food we can cry into after our disappointing sushi dinner. \n\nSo once we got our food we started to dig in and I cannot believe how good the pizza was. Thin crust and baked perfectly. The Alfredo sauce was creamy and had broccoli and zucchini in it. The pasta was cooked perfectly as well. I almost choked on my tears while I ate my pasta. It was that good. The wait staff was wonderful. She came by and checked on us and refilled our drinks. It was like the dinner we should have had in the first place. We finally ended the night on a good note and after our simple Italian dinner we boxed our leftovers and went home. We were finally satisfied. \n\nI recommend this place if you find yourself in the neighborhood. It is a bit out of the way for me but I won't be surprised if I end up here with a group of my girlfriends on one of our gatherings. It is a very spacious restaurant that can accommodate large groups. If your group arrives early enough you can dominate the back room which can easily seat 10- 15 people. It is all open seating, so first come first served. High ceilings. Laid back atmosphere where you can easily fit in with your jeans or yoga pants.

Though the restaurant was really busy and crowded, it didn't stops from enjoying the vibe nor finding a great place to sit.\n\nI ordered the house tortellini with the white cream sauce. This dish never fails and I'm always quite please. They give you I believe about 13-15 large tortellini. These were cooked very well, not too soft not too firm. The chicken stuffing seemed slightly off but was quite yummy, I would have preferred more of a concrete flavor. \n\nCream-based sauces are always my favorite and I feel Firewood could add to it a little more. The sauce is heavy but after 4 or 5 bites it status to get a little redundant and the rich flavor begins to overpower the dish. By no means did I not enjoy it but adding some sort of flavor to the cream sauce would be great, or even some type of vegetable, like mushrooms, would help a lot.  Also, the dish was served with delicious sourdough bread. \n\nOverall, great place, consistent quality, I love coming here with friends. Definitely recommend", "author": "Christopher S."}

I usually get one for lunch and have leftovers (which is not as good since the dressing makes the lettuce wilt.) I usually just share it with someone since it's plenty of food.\n\nMy go to order is Caesar Salad with Red Peppers, Corn and Walnuts. Basically... you can chose up to three toppings with your salad.\n\nAnother thumbs up from me is because when I ask for to go orders... they still mix my salad dressing instead of putting it on the side. I hate it when the restaurants don't mix the dressing for you and expect you to do it yourself. I understand the reasoning is so the lettuce will not wilt (see my first paragraph)... but if I'm paying for restaurant prices... then please mix it for me. Not like I will order it and not eat it for hours.

We weren't really sure where to go so we consulted Yelp to help us with our decision.  This place got pretty good reviews so we got in our car and drove over to the Castro district to eat here.   It's in a pretty neat neighborhood and we didn't have an issue finding a parking spot.  We did have to park a couple blocks away but that was alright since it was fun walking through the neighborhood.  \n\nWe arrived at the Firewood Cafe to find that it wasn't a sit down restaurant but that you ordered at the counter and the food was delivered to you.  This was alright but unexpected.  There was also a long line which told me that it had to be good.   \n\nI decided at the last minute to order the special they had advertised on the board behind the cashier.  It was fettuccine with chicken and pesto along with a ceasar salad and a coke.    My husband ordered chicken parm with pasta, a ceasar salad and an iced tea.   You also get a bowl of olives to eat while you wait for your food.  \n\nThe olives were very salty but delicious.   I enjoyed my coke and my husband didn't like the tea because it tasted too much like mint and was very \"herbally\".  The salad came out next.  It had real ceasar dressing on it and the lettuce was very crisp and the croutons tasted good too.  The food didn't take that long to come out but the waitress put everything down in front of us and took off very quick before I realized that I didn't get what I ordered.   \n\nI'm pretty flexible so even though I did not get the chicken pesto pasta I decided to eat what was served to me which turned out to be chicken primavera pasta.    It was one of the worst pasta dishes I have ever had.  No flavor and just hunks of unseasoned chicken mixed with broccoli.  I could hardly eat it.   My husband said that his chicken tasted like something he made at home (and he's not a good a cook).  He was also unimpressed with the capellini pasta side dish which was basically olive oil and a few tomatoes mixed with pasta.   \n\nOverall, I expected a lot more form this place especially since our meals totaled almost $50 dollars for mediocre food and no service.  We will not be recommending this place to anyone that visits San Francisco.", "author": "Meredith M."}

My Jambalaya was fantastic. No okra, which is the way I like it. The Caesar was fresh and tasty, mostly heart of romaine. The eggplant was served sizzling in a small skillet on a board. The sauce did not bury the eggplant, which tasted great. She appreciated it as a low-carb option for a diabetic. Skillful use of herbs in both the jambalaya and the eggplant.  I appreciated that they have an unsweetened ice tea, which seems to be getting rarer.\nWe had the bread pudding for desert. It was good, but was served as a cube on a plate with small bowl of whipped cream. It would have been better in a bowl with a bourbon or caramel sauce.

I thought Firewood was the cat's meow when it first opened, much like other long gone chicken roasteries that popped up everywhere about a decade ago.  While little has changed at Firewood Cafe, the prices have climbed without pause and the portions have diminished and even the presentations have gone from abundance to modesty.\n\nYou enter off 18th and are in a line when crowded or right at the ordering counter when not busy.  The menu is posted on several boards that aren't easy to read or strategically located so when crowded the line can move laboriously.  In the entrance is a big pizza oven where many things are finished off along with making the flatbread pizza's.  A large roasting station with dozens of dressed fowl rotating, a salad making station and the counter where you order.  After placing your order and paying, you're given your beverage (they offer beer and wine only) you grab your silverware and napkin and go find a table or counter to eat on and wait for someone to find your number and deliver your meal.\n\nI do like it for groups where everyone orders and pays for their own meal and no disputes about splitting the check can arise, so it is great for a group and almost always the group can find a space that can accomodate them as they wait individually for their grub.  Firewood Cafe is perfect for airports and mall's, but kind of like a missing thumb in the Castro where dining is more than airports and mall's, but they've survived a long time and there are still lines going out the door many evenings at dinner time.

I belong to a social group of more than 1000 women, and held a very successful Wednesday night games party for them in the back room of Firewood Cafe in December.  The staff was SO WONDERFUL on that day, and my friends ate, drank, played, and were very happy.  When I called in January to reserve a repeat, I was told NO PROBLEM! and the back room was reserved for us again on a Wednesday night in February.  I chose Wednesday specifically as an off night for most restaurants, and discussed the plan in detail with the on site manager both times.\n\nUnfortunately, when I called to confirm the night before the party, I was told that the general manager, Vivian, had told the on site staff that I could not have the back room after all.  I would have to pay a minimum, or only have the room for an hour.  When I suggested that the night before an event  was not a reasonable time to tell me this, I was told that they forgot to write my number down so they couldn't let me know beforehand.  I was given Vivian's phone number to talk things over.\n\nThis is the bulk of my complaint, and I hope the restaurant uses it wisely.  Vivian was EXTREMELY condescending to me.  She refused to listen to my point that it was too late notice for me to change plans, and kept talking to me about their policy of no reservations of the back room unless there was a minimum.  I explained repeatedly that Had I known that, I would NOT have made the reservation, and that I would never, ever, ever, bring my group to Firewood again, but at this point it was too late.  The best she would do was say that we could have a table in the back room, but we would have to share it with other patrons.  She refused to honor the original reservation.\n\nI want to reiterate that the staff and on site manager of Firewood were very kind and gracious.  Vivian is the one with whom we had a problem.

The tortellini with white sauce was also great and very rich. This is how I like my white sauce (that didn't sound right). It was very creamy, buttery, and thick(sounding worst). The ceasar salad caught me a little off guard. Shredded chicken and dressed very lightly. A very healthy option if you don't want to eat the heavy stuff. \n\nOverall, I thought it was great. The thin crust on the pizza had a nice char, not burnt, savory crust. For a guy that don't like pizza, it is worth the trip to check out. One more thing, the service is extremely fast.

I had the worst mushroom pizza I think I've ever had, and our daughter had the kids' pepperoni pizza that was absolutely flavourless. How do you make a flavourless pepperoni pizza?  The side ceasar salad was never great at Firewood, and it remained not great today. Its lack of greatness, however, was emphasized by the horridness of the entrees.\n\nAfter years of occassional dining at Firewood, I can only think that they've changed chefs, and the new chef hasn't adjusted to the menu - or doesn't bother to taste and season his/her food.\n\nIf I'm ever to return, it will either be rock shrimp tortollini or roast chicken.

At a non chain restaurant you can't get a salad, half a roasted chicken, and a pint of beer for $18. \n\nThe staff are always courteous and friendly. The food comes reasonably quick, which is important because I've always got less than 45 minutes to order, eat, and get back to work. \n\nThe house tortellini in garlic cream sauce is rich, sinful and probably laden with calories and fat and I love it, and feel that glutton nausea after I eat it, and I'm cool with that because I occasionally find that satisfying, like many Americans...They also have things like grilled zucchini, and gigantic salads with many toppings available. \n\nOn the healthier side I get the rotisserie chicken, and a salad in place of the potatoes. And their beer is Sierra Nevada (and a couple other brands)...it's nice when at a chain you can get a quality beer, rather than a budweiser or heinekin. \n\nThere are three separate dining areas...two well lit, the one in the middle is darker and I usually hide there during my lunch hour, and read the newspapers they provide.

Is it too hard to ask a question to the manager and get a decent response?\n\nHere's what happened: I called in and ordered the Prociutto pizza for pick up (looking forward to the 'wood fired' pizza experience from them) and they said it would be ready in 10 minutes. I got there at 11 minutes. (The sales receipt reflects this.)  I started walking out the door and turned back and said, was this just fired?  It doesn't seem very hot.  They said yes.  I got home (2 blocks away) and I should have went with my gut instinct.  The pizza crust was not even warm, let alone hot.  Granted, I knew the arugula on the pizza would not be warm, but the pizza crust, should have been hot and crispy, but rather, was cold and chewy.  Unacceptable in my view, and ok, I'll just call and inquire.  \n\nThe response --  is what prompted this review.\n\nFirstly, the same woman who took my order, and rung up my order, was now basically saying she couldn't do anything for me. (Or at least that's what I gathered as her accent was extremely hard to understand, and I don't speak Spanish.)  Secondly, I asked for her manager.  He came on the phone, and -- though a little bit better to understand, I couldnt catch his name, and when I proceeded to tell him about my experience, he wasn't prepared to do anything about it.  He said it was my fault as I got there not at 10 minutes. (I got there at 11 minutes, and he agreed to that.) He also said it was raining outside.  What does THAT have to do with serving me a cold pizza?  I advised him I did use their 30% off coupon for Tuesdays in March, but should I get 30% -- or lower -- food quality?  Or 30% lower in service?  I asked him how he wanted to rectify the situation (assuming he would provide a coupon for a free pizza) and he said he could provide a 25% off coupon.  I stated that that wasn't acceptable and that I'd be by for a full refund.  And I'd be happy to drop off the uneaten cold pizza for him if he'd like.\n\nTruth be told, this wasn't the first negative customer experience I've had here, and for me that's truly disappointing.  Their penne pasta dish with prociutto and peas and shitake mushrooms is fantastic, but everything else I've had, including the service, has been a diasappointment.  \n\nI hope things turn around here, but at the moment I'm not sure I care, as I'm not sure I'll be back.  Truth be told, I think I'll give them one more shot, -- as I want restuarants to succeed in my neighborhood -- not fail --  but for all of you, spending your hard earned money, just keep this review in mind if you step in there.\n\nCheers.", "author": "Nicole O."}

Heaven.  When I was a wee gay, it was at Firewood that I learned that you could put candied nuts on salads.  WHAT?!  Apparently it's still not widely known, as every time I make a salad and put a candied pecan or walnut on it, people act.. well, like I did the first time I ate at Firewood.  But ultimately, it's the freshly-grilled rotisserie chicken that seals the deal.\n\nGo hungry - the salads are huge, the prices are great, and you'll have plenty of mojo to go hit the Castro afterward without feeling like you became a bear in the process.

The place wasn't packed, but I was eating in early evening after working all day, so there was plenty of seating.  I will observe that at around 6:30 pm, the place really started filing up. \n\nThe restaurant is almost bizzare in the city, it really is right out of the suburbs.

They bring you your food and certainly don't offer you chili flakes or parmesean, what you see is what you get. \n\nThe pizza was tasty, although nothing special. The three kinds of mushrooms were good, but there weren't that many to be found.  The carmelized onions, while great, were almost over kill.  The sauce was actually very very good (perhaps the marguerita pizza would have been better?) but the crust was really lacking.  This place could spice things up by perhaps having whole wheat or cornmeal crusts. \n\nAll in all, an easy experience.  I think my bill was $11 and I had more than enough pizza for two women (do not try to split with your boyfriend or you will be sorry).

It's got rustic decor in the way of huge tables, a nice open front room, a small cozy back section, and a counter up front where you get to see the food go out.  This, incidentally, was a fantastic tool in helping me decide what to order.\n\nPortion size at Firewood is impressive, to say the least.  The salads I saw going out looked as if they each emptied out someone's garden.  But as I had been a Very Good Girl that day, the salads were not for me.  Instead, I opted for the veggie tortellini in marinara sauce.  A dozen, larger-than-normal dumplings of happiness were placed before me, accompanied by two hunks of bread and smothered in a very thick marinara.  The tortellini themselves were very flavorful, and I got hints of each of the ingredients as I was eating them.  I found that the parmesan within made them a little salty, but other than that they were spot on.  The pasta was a very rich, yellowy color and a very thick, chewy (but not too chewy!) consistency, and the marinara sauce wasn't oily at all.  I am fairly positive it consisted of little more than pureed tomato, and was thick enough to sit on my fork all on its own.  If you don't find this appealing, my apologies - you're missing out.  The bread was hearty, white, and just like mother used to buy from the reputable Italian bakery.  For bonus awesome, get the corn, tomato, and basil side salad.  It's extra garlicky, but that makes it extra fun!  My boyfriend opted for the salmon entree, and while he found the potatoes a teensy bit dry on their own, he said the rest of it was excellent.  He even went a little nuts over their steamed veggie side, and he's normally a very meatypotatoey type of guy.\n\nThe service, while minimal, was friendly, and I like how there are complimentary bowls of olives waiting to be snatched up at the counter along with your silverware.  These olives are, incidentally, also very good.  I was there with a large group, which was accommodated nicely, and a friend of mine arrived late and needed to grab something to go.  They helped her out with that, and put a rush on it so she could leave with the rest of us.  I had a good, solid experience.

Meal for two with a couple glasses of wine less than $40.  Go back?  Yes. (Take-out too.)\n\nPlace/Service: the Castro location is much nicer than the one in the Metreon -- high ceilings, cheery colors, interesting layout with different \"rooms,\" rotation of art by local artists.  I like the front window bar where you can watch the local fauna saunter by on 18th St. or the back room up a few steps with the skylights and booths.  It can get a bit noisy since it's all solid surfaces.  You order at the counter and the food is brought to the table.  Usually efficient, but can be slow when busy.  Orders don't always come to the table at the same time which is awkward when there are a few of you -- especially if you have proper manners and wait for your dining mates to all have food before starting to eat.  \n\nFood:  the simple and short menu is great.  For the salads you can pick 3 different toppings... my fav combination is the garden salad with caramelized onions, glazed walnuts and granny smith apples.  You can add roasted chicken too, and ask for the dressing -- great herb vinaigrette -- on the side unless you like an ocean of it.  Note: the salad comes in a salad bowl that could feed the entire table, so if you are eating it alone, you may feel like a cow grazing in an endless pasture.  Also good are the thin-crust pizzas, especially the prosciutto and arugula, and the pasta like the rock shrimp tortellini in white cream sauce -- there goes the diet!  Although they look great, the roasted chicken always disappoints but the potatoes sometimes make up for it (yummy most likely due to soaking up the chicken fat).\n\nBeverage: mediocre but passable wines.

She's an artist, so she started telling me about this pizza place where they display local artists works on the walls, and I was interested enough that we ended up taking a walk over there. And thats how I was introduced to Firewood Cafe.\n\nThe rotisserie chickens slow roasting in the window were temptation enough to go in, but once in there I couldn't resist getting a few slices of pie. The crust was doughy-and-yet-fluffy, with that taste of extra flour that come from hand-tossed dough. The food was brought to us real fast, and they did take plastic, so I have to give them positive stars for that alone. Also, they stay open pretty late - another bonus when you get those late night hunger pangs. Also, I like the fact that they support the local art scene. You don't see that too often nowadays.\n\nDefinitely worth going to, but the parking in Noe Valley can be a bit rough. On the other hand, you'll work up an appetite walking up or down the hills, so thats a bonus right there. I'll go back, you should too.", "author": "Maxx L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-10", "description": "I'm surprised to see some 2 star reviews for Firewood.  I really enjoy Firewood for what it is - a chain restaurant, with a smallish menu.\n\nFirewood is a good spot to hit if you want a quick, relatively healthy meal.  No fries and burgers here -  6 or 7 pasta dishes, a few sandwich specials, some roasted chicken specials, a few pizza options and a few salads.  They also offer glasses of wine for a relatively cheap $4 - 6.\n\nRather than get table service, you order at the register & pay up front.  You also grab your own tableware and napkins, which is likely what keeps the prices as low as they are.  The ambiance is decent and clean enough, considering.  Location is spacious, and there are some large tables if you're in a big group that needs a quick bite.  There are little plates with olives at all the tables - not much of an olive muncher, but I have a few friends who enjoy the gesture.\n\nThe salads are where Firewood really rocks my socks.  You can start with either a Caesar or a Garden, at $7.  For an additional $2 or so, you can add chicken to your salad (you get a decent amount).  I've always picked the garden, and it has an abundance of lettuce, tomato, cucumber and carrots.  The bowls are HUGE...like serving bowl size.  There are four options for dressing.\n\nHere's the kicker (in my book, anyway):  you also get to choose three \"fixings\" to add to your salad.   Things like caramelized onions, candied walnuts, green apples, pine nuts, bleu cheese, garbazno beans, etc.\n\nI've also gotten salad to go there before, and it easily becomes two meals (if you get your dressing on the side).  For less than $10, that really ain't bad at all.\n\n(If you want the perfect Firewood salad, I will graciously let you in on my personal combo:  The garden salad with chicken, and green apples, bleu cheese & candied walnuts. topped with the raspberry mustard vinaigrette.  Yummers!) \n\nTo be fair - I've ventured off my menu mainstay twice and have encountered a bit less success.  One time I had a pasta, which was perfectly decent - but the portions were nowhere near as large as the salad and I found myself a bit hungry.  A second time I ordered up one of the sandwich specials...and didn't much care for it (although the side salad was tasty).\n\nIn general, though, I've almost always had a solid experience at Firewood.  It isn't fine dining by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a spot where you can get a delicious (and gi-normous) salad for $10...and be on your way within 20 minutes or so, if you are in a rush - which I often tend to be.", "author": "Christopher S."}

This was remarkable.  And not in a good way.  \n\nFirst, they slur the name \"pizza\" by calling it that.  Here's how its made:  They take a flavorless dough (tasted like a Carrs' Water Cracker), put a tiny amount of cheese on it and bake it.  Then they slice it, put one very thin (and cold) slice of prosciutto on each slice, and sprinkle a few arugula leaves on top.  An that's supposed to be a meal?

My friends wanted to come here again this past Saturday, and since I'd already veto'd another place, I had to go along with it. Someone got the chicken, and he said it was dry, still. If you're gonna get rotisserie chicken, go over to cala market, its tastier. I wanted to get something different than last time, so I ordered chicken parm. Big mistake. It was gross but I ate it anyway. Very burnedy tasting and cardboardy hard. The pasta that came with it was better, but nothing special. There were veggies - summer squashes, which usually I like, but didn't this time. Leaving there, I felt naseous and headachey. I had to take tylenol and take a nap and I felt really yucky. Next time my friends want to eat here, I'll just sit with them rather than have more bleh food and feel yuk after. 2 of my friends tried mine and agreed that it was bad. Roomie and I stuck ours on the same bill. He had the salmon, which he said was mostly those dried up potatoes with about 2 bites of salmon. He was hungry after. I might add that between the 2 of us, we paid more for our unsatisfying bleh meal than last night at barneys, where we paid less, got more food, which was tasty and no one got sick.", "author": "Merredith L."}

Around 9 on a Thursday, we were famished and walked into this cheery fast food sit down hybrid of a restaurant salivating over the myriad options on the menu. As I was told to come for the chicken, we opted to share the herb roasted bird (which I could watch roasting on the spit- ah fond memories of Zankou in Pasadena) and a salad composed of mixed greens, roasted beets, corn, and avocado. The salads here are at the mercy of your own culinary abilities- you pick the ingredients! I'll admit, it can be a bit overwhelming, what with all the choices, but I didn't feel the panic that arose when I found myself in a similar situation back at the 21 choices frozen yogurt shop (yes, 21 choices of topping and flavors was just too much- I couldn't handle it). We sat down at a table near the window and while waiting for the food to arrive snacked on a delicious olive medly and fresh bread. The salad arrived first, soon followed by the crispy bird, skin seasoned perfectly and meat mouthwateringly tender. The portions were huge, and the price completely affordable.  I recommend sharing both the chicken and the salad- it would be way too much for one person.", "author": "Kate A."}

My CinemaSnobs friends/group had reserved the large table in the back, and we came here for dinner afterwards to discuss the film. Firewood is a small chain with other locations at the Metreon and Boarding Area A, International Terminal, SFO airport (called Firewood Grill there). That should tell you something.  The interior is nicely-appointed, though fortunately that is not reflected in the reasonable prices, offset 20% on Mondays and Tuesdays. The Italian-focused menu is limited, featuring well-prepared enormous salads with your choice of a wide variety of toppings, pizza from their applewood-fired oven, pastas such as their homemade tortellini, and fresh crispy juicy rotisserie chicken. You order at the counter (thus the bargain prices) and a runner brings the food to your table, which are all stocked with a small saucer of olives, a nice touch that I like. The fire-roasted new potatoes, $2.95 as a side, tossed with fresh herbs, olive oil, and garlic, which I've had in the past, are particularly good, with their chicken. Saturday night I had the salmon special with a balsamic glaze and small green salad, $12.20, which I enjoyed. The salmon had a nice flavor and you could taste the balsamic glaze. Wine is not that expensive at $4.50-5.50 for a glass, $18-21 for a bottle, when I've seen starting prices at $7 a glass at higher-end restaurants. A good place to dine alone on scrumptious roast chicken, size up future dates, get cheap food, host large groups, make reservations, or any combination of the aforementioned.", "author": "Hao L."}

Firewood is where I go when at the Metreon or baby-sitting in the Castro, because children love Firewood Cafe. Firewood lacks atmosphere and the staff is sooooo unfriendly. I was there with a disabled child a few weeks ago and they were so unfriendly, unhelpful, and just downright rude that between the staff and the difficult child I was with, I found myself near tears. They score big points for the level of accessibility to disabled patrons- a wheelchair ramp, large restrooms, etc. Their house tortellini is also yummy and the salads are large, if unimaginitive. I think they're a little overpriced for such generic, run-of-the-mill chain restaurant fare. I don't mind shelling out for yummy food, but a lot of their dishes simply don't taste like much.
