We glanced at the menu and were instantly intrigued. They offered quite the Mediterranean-influenced brunch variety. \n\nI ordered the Lamb Burger and it being my birthday I had to order their bottomless mimosas for only $15, quite the bargain. Their champagne to orange juice ratio was perfect. The burger itself was something to try. The bun was crunchy and perfectly toasted where as the lamb patty was perfectly cooked and delicious. \n\nThe service itself was an A+. Our server was exceedingly friendly and polite. She even overheard that it was my birthday and brought out a birthday dessert at no charge. I was not only surprised but overly grateful at this kind gesture. \n\nThe service here and the food is something to try. Loved the food and the overall experience.

The restaurant was dark and the chatter of the neighboring tables persisted throughout the night. It was fine for a lively group of family and friends, but I could imagine it being a bit rowdy for a date.\n\nWe shared the Meze Platter, which consisted of 3 or 4 small falafels (if I had it my way there would be more of these - fairly firm on the outside although could be crispier), hummus, a diced eggplant concoction (smoky, savory, and addictive), creamy tzatziki, dolmas (pickled rice, currants, and pine nuts wrapped in grape leaves), and pita bread. This appetizer was filling and the portions were generous.\n\nWe also had the Calamari Palermo, which was a tomato sauce based dish with sauteed artichoke and garlic. The calamari was fresh and the artichoke added something a little unexpected to the dish.\n\nThe entree list was fine, but since I don't eat lamb, that limited the options since the beef and lamb dishes could not be made without lamb. I opted for the Vegan Pyramid, a vegetarian dish, to avoid what might be dry chicken breast. The entree was a stack of eggplant, portobello mushroom (just 1 of these), and some other vegetables in tomato sauce, which lacked a bit of creativity in terms of flavor.\n\nThe wine selection was decent and we had a nice, robust red wine. Service was fine.", "author": "Cici T."}

This place is more wine than cocktail that's for sure. We started our Friday night with two Stella and truffle fries. \n\nI told my friend can we go somewhere light weight healthy? And so we ended up at Dunya. We both ended up ordered the angus beef burger. Ahahaha, so much for a healthy meal. \n\nThe truffle fries were thick and thin, like they sliced it themselves. It was soft with potato skin still on the fries. Like fries from in n out but a little thicker. The burger came out with fries and a salad. The burger was cooked medium rare (although our first bite showed that the burger looked more medium/medium well than medium rare) with a tomato, onion, one lettuce, and topped with buffalo cheese. There was a pink dressing on the burger as well. \n\nCan I just say that this was the best burger I've ever eaten. I think it was the cheese. I ate half of it and brought the other half home and my mom confirmed that it was one of the best burgers she's ever had. She said it probably would have been better if it were eaten fresh. I told her it was great. I probably should have also gotten something traditional, but I'm not a fan of lamb. \n\nOur server was super friendly and very attentive.

Tasty and popular at the table. \n- borek- 4/10. I've only had the more bread like version.

There is a little room to improve this dish by putting less salt on salmon, but I guess it is subjective for everyone. Definitely recommend this place.", "author": "Darkhan B."}

I got a lamb burger that came with fries and a side salad.  The side salad had too much dressing, and the fries were cold/flavorless.  The burger itself had good flavor but way too much sauce and uninspiring toppings.  The menu said it would have feta but... I found no feta.\n\nAside from the blah food, service was friendly but inattentive.  I ran out of water and no one checked to see if my food was ok or if I needed more water even though the restaurant was practically empty and the servers were just hanging out by the bar.\n\nMaybe the food & service are better during busier times?

The corned beef pieces were the only thing saving this place from 1 star. The corned beef was real and in big pieces, and tender (I am wondering if they get it from Miller'sEast Coast deli down the street.)  Yet the poached eggs on top were over done, there were green peppers in the hash (albeit big enough pieces to actually get rid of). The potatoes on the side did not have a hint of crispy on them. The water is served without ice (what is this disturbing trend lately?, we Americans love our ice - and this gal in particular loves her ice). \n\nI did try my gf's tatziki omelet and it was good...maybe this just isn't the place for brunch, maybe its better for Mediterranean food.  \n\nTo top it off, and this was not the restaurant's fault - but I was staring at some guys 2\" of ass crack at the table across the way... not pretty ;(", "author": "Amy W."}

Served in Brita-like pitchers, it's mysteriously clear which got us to think that it's probably a powdered orange mix they're using... kinda like Tang. However, the staff compensates by being very friendly and attentive, frequently doing the rounds to keep you topped up. I had the lamb burger at brunch that seemed to be a highlight and it was a pretty tasty burger. The lamb was well-seasoned and juicy. The fries looked good but disappointed. They could've been crispier and used more salt. The side salad - a generic afterthought. It's a tasty burger but competition at the $14 level is pretty tight and there are plenty of really good burgers at that price point that perhaps overshadow this one. \n\nStill, for a lazy brunch in the neighborhood, you shouldn't discount Dunya because the service here is really good and the food is decent enough without having to wait long to be seated.", "author": "Jon L."}

Just one incidence of rude service, but that's all it takes to sour me on a place.\n\nMy wife and I stumbled into this place a month or so ago and had a wonderful time. Excellent food, charming and attentive service, really great lighting. We sat at one of the small corner tables that book-end the entrance. \n\nWe are in this neighborhood frequently and when we saw it was open at 3 pm on a recent Saturday afternoon, we had no doubt where we enjoy an early meal.\n\nThat all changed immediately. Three of the six sidewalk tables were empty. Inside, five tables were free -- not to mention the completely empty long table adjacent to the bar. A four-top, two two-tops, plus both corner tables. (It's worth mentioning here that the corner tables are the same size as the two-tops but have the added charm of being in a corner, allowing for a more intimate dining experience.)\n\nThe waiter/host directed us to one of the two-tops. I politely asked if we could have one of the charming corner tables. He abruptly said those tables were for three people only. (I dare any three people to eat full-size plates at one of those tables.) \n\nI replied by pointing out that the restaurant had eight empty tables, not to mention the long table by the bar.\n\nHe grimaced and gestured again at the two-top. \"That is what we have for you.\"\n\nMy wife and I looked at each other, spun on our heels, and left. Screw that crap. We took our appetites and our money down the street to Lemongrass (lemongrasssf.com) and had a wonderful meal.\n\nWe might be particular but the quality of the food and environment at any establishment are insufficient. The dining experience includes and even depends upon polite treatment. If a place is half-empty and it's not yet 3 pm, let the customer have their requested table.\n\nThere are more restaurants in SF than we can ever hope to experience in one lifetime.

There are too many nice restaurants on Polk street here to go waste spending my money here.\n\nI see quite a few items on the menu that attract me. The mediterranean inspired  appetisers and entr\u00e9e for brunch and lunch/dinner look good on paper but in reality I've mixed emotions about them. \n\nI like the wine list and the bar specials with midweek happy hour from  3-5pm Monday to Friday and weekend brunch specials with bottomless mimosas. \n\nToday when I stopped by Dunya, I said I was going to try their brunch. Wanted to change things up instead of going to my usual stomping grounds (MyMy, Toast or Dottie's True Blue Caf\u00e9)\n\nAmbiance: Cozy, Mediterranean/Arabic d\u00e9cor, intimate\n\nHospitality: lack lustre, uninviting, lukewarm. \nUpon entering the restaurant, a group of the servers and the owner/manager were having a discussion and I just stood in the doorway waiting to be greeted and escorted to a table. It felt like I was not important and that my business wasn't needed.\nMy server didn't even introduce herself to me when I was seated. Didn't inquire if it was my first time or not. Didn't even make any appetiser/entr\u00e9e  suggestions. I had to ask her what was her favourite items on the menu and her response was very \"matter-of-factly\". \nThe only members of staff that had a pleasant demeanour and displayed a genuine sense of hospitality and appreciation for my business was the latin back-waiter/bartender and one of the latin line cooks that de-greeted me when I got up to leave. Because of these two individuals I gave this restaurant review two stars, otherwise it would've been just one. Probably I may come back because of them. Still deciding.\n\nFood: \nLamb Meat app: presentation, simple and beautiful. tomato sauce: bright and tangy, feta: salty deliciousness. Each meatball was stuffed with a black olive, unique, love it. The meatballs could've been cooked more thoroughly, it was a bit too rare for me. They were seasoned well though.\nGround Lamb Scramble: I was looking forward to his entr\u00e9e but it was a major let down. I'm a self proclaimed foodie and I take pictures of most of my meals, except this one. For one, the potatoes were done well, good seasoning, portion was a bit. The scrambled eggs with ground lamb was really disappointing. The portion size was really small and barely enough seasoning. It wasn't attractive. We some work in the presentation department for this one. I asked for a side of avocados with my entr\u00e9e and it looked like they literally scooped the avocado out of its skin and plopped it on my plate. \n\nI ate my brunch nonetheless, but I was reminiscing how I should've gone to my regular spots and spent the $35 elsewhere. Mmm, now I'm salivating over Dottie's Lamb Marquez sausage omelette, should've gone there instead, farther away, but worth the wait and trip.\n\nDunya's, I really want to like your place and food but I don't think I'm coming back.", "author": "hans simon f."}

We ordered a lentil soup that was just ok, tasted a bit better after adding lemon inside. Here's the weird part: We ordered a whole fish which was grilled very perfectly, meat tasted fresh. But it has this smelly, rotting smell that is similar to smelly cheese or stinky tofu. We asked the waitress (who was super duper nice to us, by the way) to ask the kitchen what they put in it.

It downgrades the experience a bit considering this is a wine bar.  \n\nWe tried their Mediterranean sampler plate. The falafels were cooked a bit too crispy but came with a nice spicy sauce. The hummus was creamy and well balanced while I found the dolmas sub par -- the grape leaves itself being tougher than what I'm used to. \n\nService was pleasant and they let us linger at the table even if they got a little busy later on.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-08", "description": "I am a local, so I have been here a few times over the years. In the past I enjoyed the lamb burger. On a Sunday, after running a race, my boyfriend and I were looking for a place to eat. Lots of places had lines, and we laughed at people waiting, saying to ourselves, why would people wait? There are great spots everywhere. (Side note: I think Yelp has caused the lines! People now want to wait for awesome experiences v. going for a mediocre one!)\n\nSo we sat down really excited about the food to come. I ordered a Bloody Mary, they are a wine/ beer bar, so they offered me a mimosa instead. \n\nI ordered coffee, and promptly received a cup. There wasn't any cream or milk on the table, so I drank the first cup black. When the waiter returned to fill up my coffee, I asked for some milk. He brought cream, I just used that. \n\nTo order, I thought both the pancakes and the French toast looked good. They were both 10 dollars, so I asked if I could have a smaller order of both. He said absolutely. When the bill came, he had charged me $17.00 for the order. Even though one of the orders came with fresh fruit, and it was an upsell on the other, they charged $3.00 for the fruit. 4 banana slices, two strawberries, 9 blueberries. (fruit was great!) \n\nWhen the order arrived, the pancakes and the french toast were luke warm and the syrup was almost cold. No butter was provided. They syrup wasn't maple and was an imitation cheapie something. When I asked if they could warm up the syrup they looked at me like I was crazy, and said \"we don't do that\". They ultimately did go to warm up the syrup, but they took the one from the table, and they took 10 minutes to come back. I had pretty much finished the entire meal by the time they returned, and ate more just so I could at least try the hot syrup. (Thank you for getting that, it really was necessary to warm up the food, and to enhance the flavor. I appreciated the time to do it.) \n\nCoffee was finished, wasn't offered a refill. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered an omelette and toast and jam. The toast was not included (an additional $3, for an $11 omelette, typically in the city, toast is included. When he ordered the toast he asked for jam, the waiter first said they didn't really do jam but then said they did have a fig jam.  When the toast came out and we asked for jam from another waiter he responded with \"We don't have jam\". He did ultimately get some jam. The toast was only toasted on one side and completely not toasted on the other side. His omelette and potatoes were fine. Nothing to note one way or the other. \n\nI can't imagine going back here. For two people, without any booze, the bill was over $40 and the service and food was 2 stars. \n\nMy advice would be to think through some of the small additions that could make a huge difference, whipped butter, a better toaster, cream on the tables, better pricing  and one good jam of the normal variety (strawberry is always safe), and better quality toast. \n\nI think the lamb burger is a safe bet, I would stick with that, or wait 20 minutes for another place.

The dolma and the muhammara were finger-licking good so we ordered seconds of those.  Calamari Palermo - saut\u00e9ed with artichoke, kalamata olives, garlic, basil, red sauce was decent, the sauce was awesome for dipping with the pita.  The Ararat salad was light and refreshing.  Lamb shish kebabs were exquisite - 2 skewers of perfectly done lamb cubes (i hate chewy lamb) served with aromatic rice and veggies! All this yummy food was accompanied by two bottles of a cab-zin blend recommended by our waitress.  \n\nWe ended the night with 3 desserts, the baklava, the chocolate dome, and the mango pana cotta.  All 3 desserts were great and even though I'm a sucker for anything chocolate,  I have to say the mango pana cotta was just mind blowing and all of us pounced on it.....!\n\nHighly recommend Dunya for a cozy dinner with a small group of friends or for a fun date night!", "author": "Bhavnak K."}

Lots of warm colors in the restaurant; it was very inviting.  \n\nWe ordered three appetizers: butter lettuce with grill prawn, a tuna tartar, and a Mediterranean plate with bread/hummus/baba ghanoush.  The appetizers were just average, holding us over until the entrees came out.\n\nWhen the food arrived, I was so impressed.  The seafood risotto was my favorite; rice was cooked al dente  with beautifully seared scallops and shrimp.  My mouth is still watering.  \n\nOur second dish was a fillet mignon.  Trimmed and cooked a perfect medium rare.  All in all a wonderful dish.\n\nLastly, we had a duck dish.  This was by far the most disappointing of the three entrees.  The duck tasted overcooked.  It was dry, chewy, tough, and not very enjoyable.  It was seasoned well, but was about all that was good about the duck.  \n\nThe chef came out to see how we liked the food, after hearing my disappointment about the duck, he apologized, and grabbed a menu.  He asked us to choose another entree on the house.  We ended up choosing his special: the grilled lamb chops.  The lamb was cooked medium, exactly as ordered.  Seasoned perfectly, and didn't have that gamey taste.  \n\nWe were told that the menu changes often.  Customer satisfaction is also really a top priority here.  Will definitely come back to try the new menus.", "author": "Edward N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-23", "description": "Being from Washington DC, hearing the words \"Brunch\" make my ears perk up, my heart beat a little faster, and my stomach growl like a small lion. In addition to Seersucker Thursday on Capitol Hill and Georgetown Cupcake lines that stretch two blocks, weekend brunch is a DC tradition that makes any DMVer (DC, Maryland, and Virginian for you Non-Mid Atlantic Folk) excited. So how does the weekend brunch at Dunya stack up? Well let this East Coaster break it down for you.\n\nFirst and foremost, getting a reservation here is a must. I came here with a large group, and thankfully for the planning of my peers and the helpful staff, we were able to seat a dozen of us between two tables. The brunch menu consists of Mediterranean inspired wraps, sandwiches, and omelettes, as well as some unique twists on favorites such as huevos rancheros and eggs benedict. In addition, there is the ever popular bottomless mimosas which I will get to later in this review.\n\nSo how was the food? I ordered for myself the falafel wrap and a cup of coffee. The food came out pretty quickly for how busy the restaurant was. The wrap was one of the better falafel dishes I have had. Crispy, hot, and surprisingly dense, the falafel was very good and was a nice contrast to the tahini sesame sauce and cool veggies. The size of the wrap was also more than hearty enough for my brunch needs. As a side, my dish came with a small side salad with a simple, slightly sweet vinaigrette and delicious thick cut french fries seasoned with what I believe was sumac, a slightly tart seasoning popular in Mediterranean and Middle Eastern cuisine. I liked the fries so much in fact that I was tempted to order an additional plate on the side (I resisted). So what about the mimosas? I unfortunately am not the biggest fan of drinking during the day since it makes me sleepy, but everyone at my table who ordered it gave it a thumbs up. One thing I did notice was that since it was served from a batch made pitcher, the colour of the mimosas varied from vibrant orange to pale yellow. Whoever was mixing the drinks didn't really have much consistency with the OJ-Champagne ratio.\n\nThe restaurant itself is on the compact side. There are several smaller tables both inside and outside as well as a small bar area. The wood plank walls were very interesting as they were slightly decoratively charred with various food-related words. It was a nice touch. One thing I did notice during my visit was that as the brunch hours passed and the mimosas flowed, the restaurant got increasingly louder without the number of patrons really changing. Keep this in mind if you were hoping for a quieter experience. The staff was a highlight of the restaurant. Despite having a massive group, we were taken care of efficiently, our drinks refilled regularly, and were overall treated very nicely. \n\nSo what does this East Coast brunch snob think of Dunya? Overall I was impressed. The food was good, the was service quick, and the value was also decent. My wrap was only $10 which netted me a nicely filling meal. Brunch it up, my friends!", "author": "Philip T."}

Though I didn't get the full experience of this restaurant, my dinner was very, very good.\n\nMy bf got the Lamb Kebab and I got the Beyti (ground lamb and beef in wraps).  I've posted a pic as well.  The Beyti was delicious and I love the generous serving of yogurt that went with it.  We also ordered the Falafel appetizer, which I didn't like as the Falafel were very dry.\n\nI enjoyed looking at everyone else's plates which were beautifully arranged.  Fun dinner date atmosphere, though it gets pretty loud.", "author": "Erica D."}

Got there at exactly 9.  They told us the table wasn't ready and that we were welcome to sit at the bar and have some wine.  Sure, why not, we were still waiting on a couple of friends.\n\nPoor selection of wine.  Absolutely nothing special. \n\nAs we were sitting at the bar, the bartender goes:\nBartender: here are the menus.\nUs: No thanks, we're just waiting for a table.\nBartender: I don't think you're gonna get a table tonight.  We're busy.\n\nUuhh what?\n\nThe hostess was running back and forth apologizing to us.  Okay I get it, but after a certain point your apologies don't really matter anymore.\n\nWe waited 45 minutes for the table.  We were starving.  The staff was so tense and it ruined the whole ambiance.\n\nIt was so loud!  There was music, and then there were people talking.  Then they turned the music up, then the people started talking even louder!  It got to the point where we just gave up talking to each other at all.  Awkward.\n\nThe food was below average.\n\nAnyway, just a bad experience.

It has a GREAT location though... right next to Bob's donuts! and not too far away from bars galore. \n\nAmbiance - you win me over here. Cute, dimly lit, gypsy chic style restaurant. Standard SMALL SF style (you can call for a reservation though).  The kind of place you go to split a bottle of wine with friends or date while chatting the night away.  Service was OK, nothing spectacular. \n\nFood: maybe I should have just eaten a dozen of Bob's donuts. We got hummus ($6) and pita bread. It was plain. I got chicken shish kebab and it was plain ($12). It came with rice and veggies Just tasted like someone threw chicken on a grill without any seasonings. Got a bottle of sparkling rose wine ($30+)  and it was warm ish to begin with. The waiter made us wait while the wine chilled in the bucket of ice. The table was so small that our dishes + wine bucket + wine glasses didn't really fit. We were pretty cramped in there.\n\nOverall - wouldn't really go out of my way to come here again. There's much left to explore in the city and I felt this place wasn't worth a second look. It was sort of mediocre, but wasn't TOO ridiculously expensive, so I couldn't bring it down yet another star for food quality to cost ratio.", "author": "Christine B."}

The bartender was friendly, and even did the math for us on bottomless mimosas \"I don't want to judge, but... this is a better deal\". And because I suck at math, I pulled out the trusty cell phone, and he was right: as long as they wanted at least three mimosas (and both of my companions had about 4 or 5), it was a VERY good deal -- ended up costing about $2 a mimosa... for West Bay? That's like robbery!\n\nSo on to the meal -- it was a little slow coming, but they were super-packed, and the waiter was dutiful at keeping our beverages stocked.\n\nI had a simple corned beef hash, which was a little chunky for my tastes, but the big problem was that my two \"poached eggs\" were quite literally hard-boiled by the time they got to me, which is why this is not a 5-star rating. Why it IS a 4-star rating is that when I told the server, he not only apologized and sent it back, but he apologized at least 3 other times I could count. Also, the second time around, the eggs were perfectly poached with runny yellows.\n\nEveryone cleaned their plates, everyone was slightly drunk, and none of us had anything negative to say about the noise, decor, service, or price.

Of course I did not tell him this since I am the \"designated\" date night planner in the relationship.  After reviewing so many mixed reviews about Dunya, I was expecting inconsistent food, bad service and dingy wine bar on Polk Street. Since we were already compromised because I purchased a Groupon that was about to expire next month, I thought we had to go.\n\nLittle did I know that we  were about to have one of the  nicest casual Saturday Date Night dinners at a wine bar ever.\n\nDunya is tiny. What it lacked in space, it made up for its tasteful yet simple contemporary/rustic decor.  The burgundy walls were adorned with romantic jazzy artworks. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=jDJwF74TQUYOxtCvO7B3og http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=ie5zbcS3dy6OzVKYeBBw2g\n\nA handsome wood bar stocked with wine bottles was at the far side of the room. Wine vats were used as focal point. A big blackboard lists the \"suggested wine list.\" Across from the bar is a tiny open kitchen. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=ie5zbcS3dy6OzVKYeBBw2g\n\nMy fiance and I got the best seats in the house, in my humble opinion.  We were seated by the door at the the L-shaped lounge bench which enabled both of us to have a good view of the wine bar.  It was a good place to go people-watching which at the time we were there was a fun side activity. The place was very festive and happening with people enjoying bottles of wine and small plates.\n\nThe service was impeccable! Between the server and the bus boy, we felt really taken care of. They were friendly yet relaxed--none of that pretentious \"you-are-at the-wine-bar\" kind of attitude. My guy's soda was always filled and our water glasses always topped off.\n\nFor starters, we had the MEDITERRANEAN PLATE of homemade Hummus, Baba Ganoush, Yogurt and Pita $10. This plate was so delicious! Everything was definitely homemade and tasted fresh! We asked for a second basket of complimentary bread after we finished the warm pita bread triangles to finish off our Mediterranean Plate. The plate pretty much looked like we licked it clean by the time we left this apps alone! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=_k7xd9PoatqB1ikQ5IExnQ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=FV7IxAs19WBCQos3FO_jNQ\n\nI had the SEAFOOD RISOTTO $20 made with arborio rice, white wine, veggies, scallops and prawns topped with parmesan. This dish came to me piping hot and so delicious! The risotto could have been creamier but I have no complaints. Just so flavorful and the asparagus tips were still crunchy. The 2 prawns and 2 scallops were tender and fresh. A perfect comfort food! The portion was huge that I only ate half and took the rest home. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=ZxrZWYvwG5mKYQUHTbmdUg\n\nFiance ordered the RACK OF LAMB WITH PARMESAN MASHED POTATOES AND SPINACH $20. Now for someone who is not a lamb person and who does not usually rave about his food, he said, \"Very good!\" That's saying a lot!  He thought the lamb was a little sweet which I told him was probably the mint jelly. He cleaned those bones and finished the whole thing! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vvubENH1s-YoZ-sjLWtQMg?select=DAoTuZLgU_hNiWDY_dL18g\n\nWe ordered a Lemon Pie $6  to go which looked like a casualty of war by the time we got home. It did not look appetizing anymore after it tumbled around in the car but it still tasted good.\n\nThe only thing I was not so thrilled with was my wine. I had a glass of German Riesling  $6 which was described as crisp and sweet. To me it was flat with very short finish. I could not complain though because for the price and generous pour, it was a fair sale.\n\nOverall, I am so glad we gave Dunya a chance. We enjoyed every minute of our date night at this teeny wine bar.  And I am already craving that Risotto right now!\n\nTab: $74.00 including tax and 2 Diet Cokes before tip and  $30  Groupon. \n\nI hardly dish out 5 stars but this place on the night we were there deserved if not full 5 stars but at least 4.87849759879 stars for the very friendly service, classy yet casual atmosphere and really delicious food!", "author": "Leah E."}

When ordering it, I did not expect half of an eggplant to come out (sliced lengthwise). I expected cut eggplant that was grilled and mixed with other vegetables but nope, just a full on eggplant that was slightly grilled. The yogurt and tomato sauce didn't blend well together. The only good thing about my meal was the rice. My friend ordered a chicken kebab but it wasn't cooked all the way so she had to return it and they cooked it a little better the second time around.

I felt it kicked up the dish a few notches. \n\nThe Crispy Tuna Tartare was also really good though I am not sure about their interpretation of a  tartare --- the crispy pastry shell was reminiscent of an egg roll or puff pastry. It was still delicious though the serving size was on the very small side.\n\nBoth appetizers came with a side of green salad tossed in probably a basic balsamic or extra virgin olive oil dressing.\n\nFor the entree, I asked for the 'grilled romesco muscovy duck', The grilled duck leg was surprisingly fall-off-the-bone tender served with the remesco sauce on top, and sitting on a bed of roasted carrots and baby fingerling potatoes. I loved it though I wish the portions were bigger than that.\n\nThe server strongly recommended the lemon tart as it was apparently her favorite. So ordered I did, the lemon tart. My friend ordered the Cheesecake.\n\nThe lemon tart lived up to it's billings but I was more pleasantly surprised by the cheese-cake which was probably the best I have ever had. The cream cheese was fluffy and light unlike the dense textures of many others, or the overpowering taste of those at \"The Cheesecake Factory\"\n\nIn Conclusion, I enjoyed the food and great service, but it turned out pretty expensive with the portion sizes leaving quite a bit to be desired - $80 (and we didn't even have alcohol) \n\nThe server was very personable, charming, and pretty efficient in spite of the fact that she was the lone person serving. I'd give her a full 5 stars.", "author": "Umesh T."}

We were  in line at swan oyster depot but it was kinda long so we decided to check this place out. We ordered...\n\n1. Crispy falafel - very dry and tasteless. It was served with a mixed green salad and doused with some creamy mayonnaise sauce. Presentation was unappetizing and the taste confirmed it.\n2. Calamari - not your typical battered and fried calamari but rather saut\u00e9ed with olive, artichoke hearts in a tomato broth. The calamari actually tasted and smelled fishy so it was probably not very fresh at all. Artichoke wasn't bad but it didn't taste any different than canned artichoke. I really couldn't stand to eat more than one bite of the calamari \n3. Mixed grill - we wanted to try all the different kabobs so we ordered the mixed grill which was a sample of 4 different kabobs. The chicken was probably the best out of the 4...fairly well seasoned but a bit overcooked but not bad at all. The spicy group beef n lamb kabobs n regular beef n lamb kabobs were a bit gamey and dry. The beef kabob was really dry. We had to order a side if tzaiki to make it slightly more edible. \n\nOverall the food is 1 star but the service wasn't terrible so I gave it 2 stars I would not come here again and I'm confused by the 4 star review on yelp. Next time I'll just practice a little more patience and wait in the long line instead", "author": "Mai C."}

Anything that says \"Mediterranean\" and \"wine bar\" quickly catches my attention!\n\nThe menu is very creative, making choosing just one meal difficult!  The food here was incredible.  The bread and organic butter to start with were very good- we asked for a second plate!  I had the Hearts of Romaine salad, which was only $5 and listed in starters but was definitely large enough for a meal.  I was impressed with how creatively the salad was done- it had mango salsa mixed in, which tasted great.  My boyfriend had the Pomegranate Kobe Sirloin Steak and was very impressed.  The steak was $17, but definitely worth it.  Their lunch prices are also great- the steak at lunchtime is only $9 or $10.\n\nAfter how impressed we were with dinner, we went for dessert - a cheesecake with berries and red wine sauce - and we were very impressed.  Dunya only has one dessert a night, but I would definitely try it whatever it is because everything we had tasted great!\n\nThe ambiance of the restaurant is nice.  Smaller, with a wine bar in the back as well as tables of various sizes.  The wait staff also was very friendly.  We quickly decided this was one of the top three, if not the top, restaurants we've been to in San Francisco.  We will definitely be back on a regular basis!

They had signs advertising a few events such as flamenco dancing every other Wednesday.  \n\nThe atmosphere is casual but decently classy -- perhaps a good place to bring a date.

Well that's OK, I've Dunya homework for you.\n\nThe first time I visited Dunya was a year + ago, right when it opened.  Although the branding on the window read \"Mediterranean Cusine,\" I was surprised to find that the menu was pretty much straight Californian.  My lady friend and I thought it might have been left over from the defunct hookah bar that used to be there.  But it would be crazy to think they wouldn't have simply razor-bladed those off before opening.  But I digress....\n\nWe recall the Californian-style food being decent, but nothing we tasted really flew the ole flag.  We ventured back for a sophomore effort a few weeks later, but I still found myself leaving with a similar lukewarm feeling.  \n\nSo, why the 5 start rating then?  Well, cut to a year later and one night, while brainstorming spots to eat dinner on Polk, I surprisingly hear myself suggest Dunya to my girlfriend.  She agrees and we saunter on down.  We walk in and are seated immediately.  As we look at the menu, we realize that it's completely different from what it once had been.  Instead of the California cuisine I was expecting, it was now Mediterranean.  At first I was a touch wary, b/c I was expecting Californian.  But after a glance over at the window where I spotted the familiar \"Mediterranean Cuisine\" branding, all was right in the world b/c it finally matched.\n\nThis place is remarkable for a handful of reasons.  First off, and most importantly, the food is damn tasty.  Lots of great flavors going on.  Between the two of us, we've tried pretty much everything on the menu and everything is spectacular.   Second, the menu has a lot of variety.  It walks the line perfectly between offering a good number of options without being too busy.  Third, the prices are extremely reasonable, which kind of blows my mind b/c the food is quality.  Fourth, they actually PLATE their food.  I love that.  Fifth, and this actually happened when I first went a year back, they had my favorite wine on special there - Haraszthy's 2008 Old Vine Zin.  If you haven't tried it, give this wine a go.  It's unreal.  Sixth, the waitstaff is attentive and quite handsome.\n\nDo yourself a favor and check it out.", "author": "Erik L."}

Finally after months of stopping to read the menu but not going in, I decided to check it out. It was late afternoon, well past the traditional lunchtime so it was pretty empty and I figured I should be able to get my food quickly. \n\nI pretty quickly figured out that i was not going to get my food in a timely manner. While I was greeted quickly and given a menu, placing a drink order or even getting the server's attention took forever. Unfortunately he was the only person manning the floor and had to juggle his duties as the bartender, waiter and busboy. It took about half an hour to place my order and get a drink and an order of dolma. At this point, the place was getting 3 stars in my head (poor service but tasty food and drink).\n\nAbout 45 minutes in, I got my plate. It was wrong. I had clearly asked for chicken kabobs but was given lamb (during the order taking process, I repeated chicken three times and before he left the table, the server repeated the order back to me as chicken. He then somehow forgot this exchange in the three steps it took him to walk to the grill man). If the mistake had been pretty much any other type of protein I would've just eaten it, but sadly he had picked lamb, the one protein I most definitely did not want for a late lunch. I tried to get his attention, to no avail. Finally I got up and bought the plate over to him at the bar. At this point, my rating had fallen down to one star and I was pretty sure there was no recovery.\n\nHe quickly offered to remake the order correctly. I sat down for 10 minutes and started to feel unwell since I had only eaten dolma and drank a glass of mimosa and really needed to raise my blood sugar with some real food fast. I went back over to the bar and told him to cancel the order and to just give me the check since I figured the chicken redo was probably going to take another 10 minutes and waffles at Toast was starting to sound a lot faster and less annoying by the second. He got me my check and my remade order packed to go and told me my order was on the house since he had made the mistake (hmmm... back up to two stars for great customer service skills of fixing a mistake). I was slightly suspicious of eating the remade order but was so hungry that I scarfed it down when I got home. It was delicious. If I were just judging the food, this place would have four stars. But for the whole ordeal I have to give it three stars.\n\nI would go here again. The food is great and even though the server made a pretty big  mistake, he made a great recovery and everyone is entitled to an off day.", "author": "Dani D."}

All the usual diners and boutique restaurants were packed to the gills, and we traipsed over to this unsuspecting little bistro-esque place called Dunya.  Compared to the other spots we passed on our walk, Dunya was surprisingly empty.\n\nTheir brunch menu looked really appetizing, especially the medium-sized array of omelettes they have available.  I personally ordered the three eggs any style breakfast, and that's where the service went downhill.  I ordered my eggs over easy, and all three of them were slightly overcooked.  Not a good thing at all!  I like my eggs gooey and dripping with that marigold-colored yolk!  On top of this, they gave me ONE slice of toast cut in half...yes, ONE SLICE!  Now, when you order your eggs over easy, you should get one slice of toast PER egg.  That's standard, and yes, it takes exactly one slice of toast to mop up one over easy egg.  The fact that they gave me only one slice of toast period was extremely aggravating.\n\nThe only good thing about the place was the bottomless mimosas for $12.  Bloody Mary's were also listed right next to the mimosas on the menu for $5, but they weren't bottomless.  Judging from their placement on the menu, they really should be, but I digress.\n\nSo overall, this place gets one star for the bottomless mimosas and another star for the appetizing menu.  That's all.  \n\n\n\nDidya go to Dunya?  Yes, I did, and it's one and dun!", "author": "Paul D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-06-19", "description": "I went to Dunya for lunch today, and it was probably THE WORST dining experience in my life.\n\nIt basically started when I tried to redeem my Google Offer ($5 off over $20 spent).  The Google offer is of standard fare that everyone receives via Gmail or Google Offer App on the iPhone.  \n\nAfter finishing my less than mediocre lunch, I presented my Google Offer (per the instructions, the Offer says to present to the waiting staff after the meal when he/she could mark the Offer as used).  At first the waiter said he had to check with his manager, so  I waited a few minutes for the anticipated confirmation.  To my disappointment, he emerged from the back and indicated that the Google Offer is invalid and they don't have any deal with Google. I was like WTF, then why would Google be putting this out for the general public?? I politely asked the waiter to recheck with the manager. Again he emerged and said they cannot provide $5 off and that I would have to pay the full price.  I was not happy and demand to see the manager.\n\nInstead the \"owner\" of Dunya got up from the table across from us (he was eating with his friends and witnessed the entire discussion) and reiterated that they cannot honor the Google Offer. He insisted that I take up the issue with Google.  This is when the shouting match began... I was irate that the owner of the restaurant was asking me, the customer, to resolve a problem that was clearly Dunya's to fix.  Does the owner of Dunya not understand the basics of business, i.e. the customer is always right? Over $5, the customer should always be right!!  The argument heated up as I tried to explain to him this is not my problem, but a problem that he needs to resolve with Google.  He kept indicating that it was MY PROBLEM and that essentially  I should have known better. WTF, how would I know if it shows up in my App?  \n\nHe even accused me of applying this ploy to extract a free meal.  My god, this is Dunya we are talking about, not Morton's Steakhouse! He offered me a free dinner with wine (he would open the bottle personally), if I resolve this issue with Google.  Does that even make economic sense? Wouldn't it be better that he provide me $5 off than a free meal with wine? Like most dubious businessmen, the offer of \"compensation\" was merely hollow words.\n\nInstead of spending another minute chatting with the owner, I paid the FULL amount, excluding tip (I saw the waiter snickering in the back!!!).  I just couldn't take the BS anymore.  I could have left and not paid, but I am a honest person and paid the full amount.  As I left, the owner sat down with friends and continued with the routine like nothing had happen.  They were probably mouthing me off as I left.  I can only imagine what they were saying: \"What a dumba@ss. Who uses Google Offers anyways? Groupons are the best\" or \"Hahaha, you screwed another one! I can't wait for the next guy who tries to use Google Offers.  Who is Google anyway?\", or \"I don't like the way he wears his pants - only dishonest, freeloaders wear pants that in that manner.\"\n\nMy girlfriend took video of the entire altercation. I would post the video on Yelp, but the feature doesn't exist.  I am usually not the type to say bad things about anyone, but this situation prompted me to write on Yelp.  Hope your day is going well and I hope to god that you don't go to Dunya with a Google Offer! Yelpers don't do that to Yelpers....\n\nCheers!", "author": "Thor T."}

During this time I tried out Match for a couple of months, even though my friends were like \"You don't live in a mountain or a secluded farm, get out of there\". I didn't really understand how the whole winking and favoriting was like. I see this cute guy and silly me decides to send him a wink. Glad he didn't see it in person, because I sort of twitch. At least its better than a Facebook poke, right? Only thing, this guy ignored my existence completely. I am such a dork I thought to myself, but I like to take risks. \n\nSo It's Thursday night and my friend and I walk in and I glanced to my left and see she says hi to the guy in table with 4 other people. I avert my eyes towards him and my jaw just dropped, OMG, it's the wink match guy!!! She introduced us and we all sat in the same table, sat right across from him. I was really hoping this guy did not notice me. But his smirk just sold it, he obviously knew. I started to speak in Spanish to my friend so he would not understand, and actually showed her his match profile on my phone. She was cracking up and before I know it he says \"De donde son?\" (Where are you from?). He heard us the whole time, because he speaks Spanish!!!! So embarrassing. I chugged about 3 glasses of wine that very moment. Found out he looked at my profile right after that night. He told me in another encounter, \"See we didn't need Match to meet.\" \n\nA little later my friend and I go to the bar and our friend gives us a glass of  wine to try, which was good in my opinion. My friend says \"I don't like it, it sucks\" and this older guy out of no where standing next to me says \"Hi I'm \"Bob. (Don't remember his name) That's my wine. What did you think? \" My friend almost spit her wine out and we immediately smiled and said, \"Its fantastic!\" The guy spoke to us for 20 min and gave us his card, welcoming us to his vineyard in Sonoma anytime. Wow..now I know I can't give an opinion about wine out loud or much less speak in code in another language. Other than that, great ambiance for a date or a chill night out. \n\nWe ordered the Stag's Leap Merlot 2007, Napa Valley with\nfirm tannins, with aromas of fennel, leather, & cassis as well as the TR Elliott Pinot Noir Burgonet 2006, Russian River Valley with red cherry and dark plum with earthy mushroom, great structure,a soft but sure tannic backbone framed by sweet oak, hummus platter, and an amazing Med dessert.

Had been really interested in trying it, and had heard mixed reviews.  Like previous commenter has stated, for the amount of food you get, as well as the quality of the food, it was pretty sub-par for the price.  We got cold bread and oil when they brought out our water.  To start, we got 3 appetizers for $21, we order the Tuna tartar, the butter lettuce with grill prawn & the Salmon wrap stuffed with crab.  \n\nTuna tartar barely had any tuna in it, not that you can taste it or see it.  The tomatoes & avocado was bigger then the little amount of tuna.  I've tried many tuna tartar, and this was by far the first that I could NOT taste or see the tuna. \n\nThe butter lettuce with grill prawns (with mango salsa) was decent.  It has two decent amount prawns on it.  \n\nThe Salmon was the worst. It was supposed to have crab in it, however, we found out after asking about it, that it was only a spread. The cheese & mixed green over-power whatever crab might have been in it (Look at my pictures). *I have to say, I was really sadly disappointed with this, especially based on the description, it makes it sounds like it will be stuffed with crab and not veggy with a crab spread. Very deceiving. \n\nThe waiter, Rimon, messed up the order, I had order the Seafood risotto and instead of writing it down, he confirm verbally with me twice, and he messed it up writing it down. Before we even finish the appetizer, they brought out the entree, and it was wrong. So, they took it back, then brought only the chicken back. So, only my sister was eating. \n\nThe Petaluma Roasted Chicken was dry.  Having messed up my order for the Seafood risotto, they held the chicken in the back after bringing it out, so it was somewhat cold and dry by the time it got to our table.  The grilled vegetables was also over cooked. \n\nBy the time the Risotto  came, I was expecting redemption, how sadly I was mistaken.  The risotto was hard. Not al dante, but just hard.  The sauce wasn't very good, and one scallop was over cooked.  The portion size was a joke. It would not fill anyone up.  I agree with Kim W.'s review that it lacked flavor, and the shrimp and scallops were mediocre. \n\nOverall, a sad experience.

So when they appeared on one of the daily deal site, I got one. \n\nI let the coupon sit and when I remembered to use it, it turned out their menu has changed. It is now standard Mediterranean fare (not my favourite changes as I wanted something a little different) but the price had gone down considerably (definitely a plus).\n\nCame here for an early dinner with a friend on a weeknight. It was definitely not busy. \n\nThe food was reasonably priced. We were completely stuffed from an appetizer sampler ($15), shrimp kebab ($13) and pasha bayildi ($11). I'd normally try to spend more than what my coupon covers, $40 in this case but the portion were pretty big so that was pretty impossible with two people.\n\nI enjoyed some dishes in the sampler and left some others. The falafel, eggplant salad, hummus and ezme were good but we weren't too crazy about the haydari,  piyaz and sigara boregi.\n\nThe prawn kebab had 6 sizable prawns, nicely grilled and great with a splash of the grilled lemon wedges that came on the skewers. I did leave about half of the pasha bayildi for 1) I was full and 2) I found the tomato sauce smothered the flavour of the eggplant, a favourite vegetable of mine (well, technically a fruit). \n\nWhen paying, the server charged the tax twice on the bill, once before tip and once after (since the coupon specified a fixed gratuity). I pointed out to him and he went back to fix the problem. \n\nIt appeared to be just a genuine mistake as he stood there for a few minutes trying to fix it and had to call the owner over.

That kind of put a damper on the whole experience, but that isn't saying anything about the food, wine, or service.\n\nEverything up to the point of paying the check was fabulous.  We had some Calamari, Ezme, and got the lamb kebab and Beyti for our entrees.  Everything was just delicious.  Really, really good food, great service, super cool space.  Really dug this place.  5 stars all the way for everything as far as I'm concerned, I just had to go with 4 stars due to them not accepting our coupon.  It's a very reasonably priced place as well, so it wasn't about the money, it was just the coupon aspect was misleading and was the motivation for us coming to check out the place and order more food than we normally would (minimum purchase on coupon).  So yeah, really thought the place was great, I just wish they'd think before they stop honoring coupons people have already purchased.", "author": "Sean H."}

We were all very pleased with our meal -- I consider myself quite the lamb connoisseur, and I completely approved of their lamb shish-kebab (although you have to request it well-done unless you like it medium-rare inside). Each dish came with a side of ride and butter-cooked vegetables, both of which were fantastic. My roommates got the vegetarian appetizer platter dish and the chicken wrap, both of which they said were great!\n\nI know this is a wine bar, so next I come here with my roommates we will probably try the wine+appetizers (which are large in portion).\n\nWorth a visit, and many more after that!", "author": "Meghana D."}

The service was extremely professional and attentive when needed. The food was awesome.  We enjoyed everything we got including 6 starters and 3 entrees. \n\nThe atmosphere is lovely.  The music was a bit loud, so we asked Alisa to turn it down so we could talk without yelling.\n\nWe had a wonderful experience and will return.  The food is delicious.

I have not had a Mediterranean snack in a while and I tend to pass this place on several occasions so I decided to pop in. The place was empty, but it was 3pm so I can kind of understand. I ordered the Adana Kebab Wrap (Charcoal ground lamb and beef  with Parsley, red onion and spices). This came with fries and a green salad. Overall I wasn't blown away but I wasn't expecting to be. The meat was a little dry for my liking. The fries were seasoned with  garlic and probably parsley. I would have liked to have some ketchup with them. (I thought it was inside my to-go box, but I was wrong... should have checked.) The green salad had a pretty good dressing. \n\nOverall I'd say this place is just OK.

Sadly, the mimosas here are very weak and pretty much just $12 Orange Juice. Further adding to the below average mimosas is that fact that they just come by the table and fill your glass up when they think it is ready. Needless to say, you may be waiting long enough to be drinking another Mimosas. \n\nThe food can be good, but I have personally experienced some inconsistencies. I really like their hummos and pita bread. Their babajanoush was some of the worst I have had because of its flavorless tone and unauthentic texture and general peculiar texture. \n\nI would give Dunya another chance, but I think they need to get their Middle Eastern dishes down and they may need to hire another server to balance the work load.", "author": "Theresa T."}

Good thing I had a run planned the next day because it was worth every bite.\n\nOur waiter was hilarious and we got along with him really well- I feel like we really bonded and formed a friendship with this guy but of course forget his name so I'll just call him our waiter-friend.

It was about 10:00 p.m. on a Friday night, and although the place was hopping, we were fortunate to grab one of the last four-person tables in the joint.  Thinking back to our last visit here, we immediately knew that we wanted the Falafel and the Hummus Plate for appetizers.  And as expected, both were just as good as they were the first time.\n\nMy wife and I shared the Free Range Chicken for dinner, which came with some seasoned vegetables and rice.  It was succulent - falling off the bone, not too greasy, and unbelievably simple but tasty at the same time.  Our friends tried the Sigara Boregi appetizer - a rich, fried feta cheese pasty - as well as one of the beef/lamb kebabs.  Both of our friends are from Armenian descent, so they're familiar with Mediterranean Cuisine and they were thoroughly impressed with what Dunya had to offer.\n\nThe icing on the cake was that one of the head servers dropped by our table to say hi.

What lured me in was their happy hour. I've been back a handful of times since then and just tried their dinner on Friday night with a girlfriend. Their happy hour specials are AMAZING! For $10 you get a glass of wine and an appetizer. I'm used to paying $10 just for a glass of wine so this was a treat! The portions are very generous. It's not a little glass of wine with a two-bite appetizer...you'll be satisfied with what you get...especially for ten bucks! \n \nOn Wednesdays it's ladies night. If you buy one glass of wine, you get one free. They also have flight specials for $10 - I've tried both the red and white flights and they were fantastic. The owner was even nice enough to let me try the wines before ordering just to make sure I was happy. \n\nWhat I've tried for happy hour:\nThe grilled lamb riblettes are probably my favorite appetizer. Not only do you get the riblets but you get a nice salad to go with it. The lamb is tender and falls right off the bone. The ahi tartare and shrimp salad are also tasty. Each appetizer is paired with a complementing wine. \n\nWhat we had for dinner on Friday:\nMy girlfriend and I shared the mediterranean plate. Their hummus and baba ganoush are homemade and both are delicious. It comes with warm pita bread and a few other things. I ordered the grilled lamb chops for my entre. These were tender, juicy and cooked to perfection (medium rare the way I like it). I asked for no potatoes so he substituted them with spinach. I'd definitely get this dish again, but next time I'm trying the risotto. A few guys sitting next to us ordered it and it looked (and smelled) fantastic. My friend ordered the smoked salmon pancakes and the grilled lamb riblettes for her meal. I LOVE smoked salmon so I stole a few from her.

The place is awesome, the service is friendly, they just need to get their menus/cooking a bit straightened out.\n\nWe ordered two bottles of wines for a group of 6 and they were both fine. No issues with the drinks at all.\n\nBut food wise we all ordered various things:\n\nAppetizers:\nStuffed Green Olives with Lambs - A couple of my friends got this, I didn't try it but the main fact is that when the dishes came, there were no olives on the plate. Instead it was a plate of salad with 4 lamb meatballs. We asked our server who then confirmed that we were correct, there were no olives so they just had the lamb meatballs tonight. My friends said they were fine to eat, but just in principle they surely didn't get what they had ordered/expected to eat.\n\nCrispy Ahi Tuna Tartare - Again some of the other people in our group got this for their appetizer. Let's just say it wasn't really ahi tuna, but more fully-cooked tuna eggrolls. Again, they were fine but not what was expected and definitely not ahi tuna\n\nSmoked Salmon and Grits Pancake - This actually came out the way it was expected. I had a bite of my friend's and it was alright. Not absolutely amazing but the grit pancake had a nice texture to them. The salmon was nothing our of the ordinary and the crab was a nice touch.\n\nCapay Farms Organic Greens - With my love of beets, I got this salad but was sad to find only 2-3 small pieces of beets when my salad came out. As a one out of three of the ingredients listed, I was hoping for much more but was sad to find a measly few.\n\nEntree:\nGrilled Pomegranate BBQ Kobe Sirloin: I think 3/6 of my friends got this dish and was not very impressed with it. For me, it was very odd to find that two of them seem to have gotten 'filet mignon' cuts and then the third got a VERY marbled piece of sirloin (more so like ribeye even) cut. They all said the sauce was a bit overpowering, I had a taste of the meat. It was ok. My friend definitely had hers requested at a Medium and receive it more so on the rare side. Again, another friend had tons of fat on his making it less like a sirloin.\n\nPan Roasted Fresh Scallops: I got this dish, which ended up being more of a pasta dish. There were maybe 3-4 small pieces of scallops and even then, when I was chewing them, I definitely felt some pieces of sand or something that made crunchy noises. In addition, the dish wasn't very hot which made me think it had been sitting there for a bit and thus was not fresh. I didn't even finish the dish, I got a bit turned off 1/4 through it.\n\nGrilled Romesco Muscovy Duck: This was a pretty good dish, I think from what my friend had said after eating it. She did say though that it was dressed a bit too much with the sauce and it was overpowering for duck.\n\nDessert:\nIt was a friend's birthday, so we asked to have a mini celebration for her. They came out with a cheesecake, which even between the 6 of us was NOT finished. And this cheesecake was NOT that big (maybe 4\" in diameter?). The cheese did not taste like it was made with the correct type of cheese. A bit too intense for cheesecake.\n\nOverall, the food was a bit of a downer. However, service was absolutely amazing. She was sweet enough to give us the cheesecake and a small bottle of bubbly because we were celebrating our friend's birthday. \n\nI think I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was an off night for them especially since all the other reviews are full 5 stars! Give them some time since they just opened up and return back in a few months and hope for better.

I'm Greek and have been around Mediterranean food for most of my life, so I feel I can safely say that.  None of their entr\u00e9s were Mediterranean, and I certainly wouldn't classify a restaurant as being Mediterranean just because they have hummus as an appetizer.  It was a bit disappointing to walk in, sit down, and read the menu.  I would say Dunya is more Asian/Italian/American fusion.  \n\nThat being said, the food was still very good.  I had salmon with rice and mango salsa, and my boyfriend had some kind of roasted chicken dish.  My food was decent although the mango salsa was too sweet, if there were any kind of spices at all in the salsa, or even just a little coriander mixed in, that would have improved the dish quite a bit.  Also, the salmon itself seemed very bland, usually salmon has quite a powerful flavor so I was put off by that.  And if I'm going to be really picky, it was a little on the dry side as well.  My boyfriend's food however seemed great.  He was very satisfied with the taste, and from what I could tell the chicken looked very moist.  The portion he had was huge, it was practically a whole chicken!  And it was almost entirely meat, he only found one bone. \n\nThe best part about Dunya is the service, our waitress was extremely attentive, she checked in on us enough times without overdoing it, and she was prompt with the check.", "author": "S.

Since my date has been to Dunya many times, I was excited to get his recommendations on what to order. We came last Saturday night. We arrived somewhat early after a day walking our dogs at Alamo Square.   \nWe started off with red wine... a delicious blend of Zin & Cab... I can't recall the winery. We shared the appetizer platter, which had a little of everything. I love hummus & falafel. We continued to drink, he probably should have ordered a bottle. And later we shared the Beyti, which was absolutely incredible. I've never had anything like it.  It has lamb, walnuts  and yummy other stuff wrapped and cut up in slices with tomatoe sauce and yogurt drizzled through out.  We just ate, drank, talked and laughed... I think our waiters probably wanted us to leave since the table next to us, had rotated 3 different couples while we were there.  Customer service is very accommodating & super friendly.  I'm guessing he tips well. \nI love that this is walking distance from where I live.  I look forward to coming back.", "author": "Myra M."}

Overall, it was a forgettable dish.\nChicken Shish Kebab ($12)- my kebab was not fully cooked. When I told my waiter in a discrete and polite way to not scare neighboring tables, he simply glanced at it and walked away. Perhaps he was too ashamed to apologize? Who knows. He did come back to tell me two more minutes but did not acknowledge the pinky texture of my meat. \nIt came back with the missing chunk that was pink, super greasy, yet still not flavorful. Hmmmm if I'm going to eat something so oily, I'd expect some delicious goodness at the least but this was far off.  I wish this tasted better since it looked so good on the plate. My order also came with a side of grilled/greasy veggies- I DID like the veggies though- they were extremely flavorful. \nSparkling Rose ($36/bottle)- We opted for this since not everyone in our party likes reds. Nothing spectacular- I'd recommend not ordering this either.\n\nWe opted to not risk it with dessert since the dishes were all mediocre. Overall, the restaurant has a nice decor and homey vibe. I just wish my chicken was fully-cooked and more tasty. Overall, 2.5/5 stars but I'll round up since their bar area did look appealing.", "author": "Patricia K."}

When the busboy is paying more attention to you than the two servers, there is a problem.

The food is taking much longer, and if you'd like your check in 5 minutes, you should give him an additional 10 minute lead time. \n\nPlease bring back the charming server who manned the Sunday brunch bar in early July. Having to rely on the polite, but very busy, busboy for mimosa refills is getting tiresome.\n\nDunya, you're getting copycats on the bottomless mimosa brunch draw.

Out of our party of four, none of us were impressed with the experience BUT I do think there's potential.\n\nThings done well:  The ambiance is quite nice.  Lightly-glossed, wood paneled walls make you feel as though the place has been there for ever, the lighting & simple decor were pleasant and the bar was lovely.  The staff were friendly but...\n\n...Considering there was only one party in the restaurant when we got there, the service was questionable (which I'm chalking up to the staff being green).  I was the only person who asked for a drink (diet coke with a lemon) and I had to ask again for the lemon when it came.  At a busy bar I get forgetting the garnish but when you are the ONLY customer placing a drink order - I don't get it.\n\nThe pancakes were voted \"pretty good\" but the eggs benedict received an \"I make a better eggs benny at home\" and the hash was, and this was a  first - mushy.  I must say the flavor was good but I just didn't appreciate the consistency being something like raw ground chuck.  I had to request toast (which didn't come with the hash) to smear it on.  The toast took at least 10 minutes and while the waitress was sweet & apologized for the wait - any breakfast spot (with only 8 customers on hand) should be able to quickly produce toast.  Worth noting is that we also had to request: salt, pepper, Tabasco and silverware.\n\nAll in all, I'm not opposed to trying Dunya again.  I'm hoping that breakfast is a new offering for them and they just need some time to figure it out and get the operation running more smoothly.\n\n\n\"", "author": "MJ P."}

The meatballs are stuffed with chopped olives and gives it a really nice Mediterranean flavor. The side salad with feta that came with it looked more like an afterthought and was a little unnecessary.\nShredded pork fettuccine ragu - meh. The pasta was tasteless, not even salty enough to make for a good pasta. Pasta tasted like it was pre-cooked and cooled down so it doesn't hold on to the tomato sauce so it just tastes like plain pasta with a side of shredded pork in tomato sauce. The pork was alright too. This is their special so it's not on the regular menu.\nSeafood rissotto - It was pretty good. The seafood (2 shrimp, 2 scallops) were pretty well cooked and decent. It tasted fresh. The rice was good. The whole dish was pretty good. $20 good? No.\n\nThe wait staff was really nice and upbeat.

I decided to give it another shot today.\n\nFIRST of all - service and other issues:\n1. I went in and there are like 6 people who work there all just kinda standing around watching me. It makes me feel like I'm intruding in someone's home. They are all extremely friendly and eager to help, it's just a little odd.\n2. The happy hour special says that wine is half price 4-7. I ordered 2 glasses of wine and was charged full price. Nobody told me about any special. I found out only when I went to write this review. NOT COOL.\n3. The menu says all entrees are served with rice and vegetables. Apparently all except for the one I chose. When I brought this up, the manager/owner pointed to my plate and showed me some vegetables on it. When I pointed out that was not what I had expected, he brought me some wonderful roasted veggies and rice.\n4. I ordered some stuff to go after my meal.They sent me home with the sauce already on the salad and such and seeping everywhere. NOT COOL.\n\nSECOND - the food:\n1. Dolmas are one of my favorite things in the world. These were tasty, but super mushy inside, which was kinda gross.\n2. The beyti was good, but the meat was a little dry. It was also cold when it came to me even though I was one of 2 tables at the time.\n3. The wine list is really pretty darn good.\n4. The falafel is some of the best I've had.\n5. The meatballs were supposed to come with romesco sauce and didn't. They were dry and hard.\n6. The hummus is pretty good, but they sent it with me in an overfilled foldover container so it spilled everywhere. They wrapped the pita in a roll, which was covered in the sauce they put on the salad. \n\nThe wine list is redeeming. The location and the outdoor table are great. But I won't be back for food and will expect them to mess up everything if I decide to brave it for the wine.", "author": "Monika M."}

I believe this special premiered today, and I must say that it has earned my endorsement.\n\nThat the waiter was out of commission due to a car accident this morning and the owner had to make a run to the shop next door to fetch some coffee on my behalf only served to enhance and render more intriguing my dining experience.\n\nI think some Yelp reviewers shortchange themselves when they expect perfection, as conventionally defined, in their dining experiences. For me, it is the little surprises, such as the owner's charming inexperience assuming the waiter's role due to his unexpected absence, that make dining experiences particularly delectable and worth savoring.

Location near the corner of Sacramento & Polk is great (also #19 bus almost in front of the door). Owner Ramon told us his wife makes ALL the desserts, and you must try the cheesecake --- yes it is fine, dense, quite a generous serving.\n\nOn two separate visits, we've had the lamb chop entree, the seafood risotto entree, the Mediterranean plate appetizer ($1 add'l for extra pita; regular price includes babaganoush, hummus, olives, yogurt, cucumbers), vegetarian stack entree, lamb meatballs (appetizer stuffed with olives & topped with feta), and the pita/hummus appetizer. Dunya's hummus is the best I've had & the pita arrives hot, hot.  Also interesting: the starter bread (with herbed oil) is heated to toast temperature, but not browned. If you expect warmed bread with your meal, this is a welcome bonus. \n\nFavorites: cheesecake, lamb chops, hummus, risotto. But everything shines. We didn't have the wine, but the blackboard list is amazing -- NZ, Aussie, Napa, Argentina, Santa Lucia, and those are just the wines by the glass (range $6 - $17 per). Wine flights look pretty creative, popular. \n\n5 stars? Yes, it's possible. We found the music a tad too loud, and our cushions kept falling off the benches. Prices could be lower for size of servings, and a lower price would also bring in more customers. We first found this with a Groupon.com ($15 for a $30 credit), and returned a few days later to try more menu items.

Poor girl, she'd just started and didn't know how long it takes to cook something. But I'd imagined they were just that busy -that a wrap could take so long. I have been struggling with a Mediterranean urge and haven't been able to satisfy it properly, so I decided to see how Dunya can do in this department. It was decently priced for 3 falafel, lettuce, special sauce, blah tomatoes, including garlic fries (yum) and bite of mixed-greens salad: $6.74. I had some struggle getting in and out with my lunch due to the sweet but chatty waitress.

I was inspired to write because I could not stand idly by and see this place have a yelp rating on par w/ Acquerello and some of the really terrific restaurants in the area.\n\nI was excited to go here after read all the 4 and 5 star reviews of this place - heck it's a Mediterranean wine bar, basically on my block!  Not to mention my gf had a Bloomspot coupon for $30 of food.  What could go wrong?  Unfortunately, this place fizzled out like the French soccer team at the World Cup.\n\nI hope they were simply having an off night, because it was one of the worst meals I've had.  I started with a beet salad, which was OK, nothing to write home about.  But then I got... the vegetable risotto.  It was basically unseasoned.  Ok, I lie.  It was seasoned.  With more garlic in a plate than I had ever seen before.  The risotto was overpowered by garlic, garlic, and more garlic.  And the dish basically had no salt.  There was not one thing redeeming about this dish.  My girlfriend ordered the duck special, and it was good enough.  Nothing memorable.\n\nService was also...strange.  Our waitress, unfortunately, had some sort of arm injury and served us one-handed.  That was admirable, but not ideal from my perspective.  This was a Friday night around 6:30, and were were the ONLY group in the restaurant.  So you'd think, ok, this is a weird vibe, but food will be fast, right?  WRONG.  The waitress came to our table twice to tell us our food was coming and she was sorry for the delay.  If you have to apologize for the delay...it is probably an excessive delay.  Which made absolutely no sense because we were the only people there.  I could see the chef standing in the kitchen...he didn't LOOK busy, but what do I know?  Finally, each time we got a course, the waitress came by w/in 30 seconds of our first bite to ask us how the food is.  Of course we hadn't had time to TASTE it yet.\n\nSo you say - it wasn't your best meal, but it shouldn't have been pricey, not with your $30 Bloomspot coupon, right?  I thought I'd be getting a good deal when I told my gf to order what she wanted, and I'd cover whatever her coupon did not.  Well, we each got $10 wine flights, and our own appetizer plus the entree.  The total was close to $50 on TOP of the coupon.  We could not wait to get out, what a bizarre dining experience.  I felt so awkward about only eating only 2 bites of my entree that I asked for a box, said I was full.  I'm sure she knew THAT was not true.\n\nI really hope that other people had better experiences, but I want to make sure other people don't go to this place expecting a 4.5 star experience, and end up with what I got.", "author": "Ravi R."}

Ridiculously close to mi casa? Si, senor!  Cute interior? You betcha!  Amazing-sounding menu posted online? Fuck yeah!\n\nThe first time we ordered off the brunch menu.  We got pancakes to share, kobe beef hash for me, kobe sliders for the hubs.  \n\nThe beef hash was pretty good: not too greasy, but still flavorful.  The eggs were perfectly done (though, how hard is it not to fuck up eggs?) and the potatoes were yummy.  The meat was ground beef and didn't taste kobe-tender, but I assumed that was just because it was ground.  (I would later find out that this restaurant just uses bad meat)\n\nI didn't try the sliders, but the hubs seemed to enjoy them.  Well, the outside of them, anyway: he ordered them medium-well, but they were definitely rare.  We were kind of in a rush (and he was pretty happy from the mimosas), so we didn't complain.\n\nThe pancakes were pretty tasty, but also undercooked.  They aren't like typical American pancakes and are closer in taste to European pancakes (sweeter, creamier, more crispiness on the outside).  If they were fully done, they would've been amazing.\n\nThe second time we went (lunch) was just horrendous.  To start, the menu options that are posted online for lunch were listed on the in-resto menu at much higher prices (e.g. pomegranite kobe steak is $10 online, $17 in person).  My bro and I both got the kobe steak kebabs and I must call shenanigans, because this was NOT kobe steak.  I've had better quality meat at crappy taco trucks in the East Bay.  Scratch that, I've had better quality meat at crappy taco trucks in Tijuana.  \n\nThe steak was inedible.  Literally.   I spent the whole time chewing around chunks of fat and connective tissue.  I'm not a picky eater (especially when it comes to steak) and I have a good bite, but I couldn't handle the kebabs. Unfortunately, we were in a rush again and didn't send the food back.  We should've.\n\nDunya is really cute inside and is a nice addition to the below-Clay stretch of Polk.  I just wish that the quality of the food matched the look.  *Sigh*", "author": "Alisa N."}

It took longer than we thought for my friend & I to get out of the office, so my boyrfriend called to change the reservation to 7:45 pm. We arrived just on time, but apparently our reservation hadn't been changed \"on the books\". The place is pretty small, so we stood at the bar and nearly finished off a bottle of Cotes du Rhone Rose before we were seated about a half-hour later. Since the coupon was for a certain dollar amount off of wine purchases, we decided to go with another bottle once we got seated. We then shared a few of the vegetarian apps to start: Kabak Ezme, Crispy Falafels, and Sigara Boregi; a plate of pita triangles came on the side.\nThe Kabak Ezme was a kind of pureed zucchini-yogurt dip, flavored with mint, dill, and garlic. The dip was thick like Labneh, with a great yogurt tang and a subtle hint of garlic. The falafels were nicely crispy and just the right size - I am so tired of baseball-sized falafels. The accompanying tahini was very creamy and flavorful. The Sigara Boregi were just what they sound like - little \"cigars\" of feta and parsley wrapped in phyllo and then fried. These were actually my least favorite of the apps, just seemed a little bland compared to the others. There didn't seem to be much parsley *or* feta flavor. I even dipped them in first the tahini then the Kabak, but that didn't add any flavor either. They might have needed a little longer in the fryer as well, the phyllo wasn't that crisp. \nFor our main courses, we opted for the prawn shish kebab and the beyti. The shish kebab was served as 2 skewers and was definitely enough for 2 people to share. It was a nice presentation of prawns threaded with lemon slices. The prawns were well-cooked and lemony and apparently marinated in \"exotic spices\". The beyti was a dish not familiar to me, but it was delicious. Thin lavash bread was wrapped around oblong patties of finely ground beef and lamb. The meat was well-seasoned and spiced. A rather uninteresting tomato sauce surrounded the individual \"wraps\", while some more tangy yogurt and some unremarkable veggies came on the side. We had filled up so much on the apps that we had to take some beyti home with us and didn't have room for dessert. The beyti tasted very good for breakfast yesterday :-)\nMinus a star for not having the Turkish national dish of Manti (!) and another for the seating issue at the beginning. I wish a couple dishes were more cohesive as well. There is another coupon today through SF Weekly though, so I will probably buy that and return to try the lamb burger and the piyaz based on their yum reviews.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

My boyfriend and I are not foodies by any means, and are happy with most any food, we love to eat!  We ordered the seafood risotto and the waiter recommended a chef special - a salmon with a white wine sauce.  The risotto lacked flavor and the veggies, red onions, green & red peppers, were pretty much raw and crunchy, they just didn't seem to go.  The scallops and shrimp were like what you get from the freezer aisle at Costco, not bad, but not great either.  It seemed like an entree by someone just learning how to cook.  The salmon also lacked flavor and we probably would've been better off going with the orange BBQ salmon that was on the menu.  Both dishes were blah and I didn't finish my risotto.  The food also seemed overpriced for what you get, even if it was delicious food.\n\nIt was empty on a Saturday night at 8:30 p.m. so that should've been our indication.\n\nService was fine, but will not be returning.", "author": "K V."}

After being glared at by other folks hoping to snag my prime piece of parking real estate, I headed over to the shops on Polk Street. I wandered in to Dunya to get out of the rain, after deciding a glass of wine was better than a cup of coffee.  The bartender was really friendly and before I knew it I was ordering a cup of soup to \"warm up\". I was planning on a nice spot of Lentil, but the bartender recommended the daily special, salmon chowder, because it would go really well with my glass of Laurier Pinot. In fact it did. The soup was hot and nourishing with a nice balance of seasoning. It hit the spot, as did the warm pita that accompanied it. I like Dunya, especially since my visit there was unplanned and because they let me dawdle over my glass of wine until my hour was almost up. I want to go back sometime and try more things.", "author": "Nicole M."}

I had probably passed by Dunya dozens of times walking up and down Polk St., but it never really caught my eye until I was perusing Yelp. As we were already in the mood for Mediterranean, this was the perfect spot...a good mix of eclectic vibe, young (20-30 something) crowd and extensive menu (a little something for everyone...veggie, meats, etc.)\n\nI made a same day reservation on a Friday, and I'm glad I did. There were a few large parties and a few 2-tops, and the place was packed. We were immediately sat and the \"cozy\" atmosphere made for a server/busser to always be available for an order or other need.\n\nApps:\nMixed Platter - Perfect for 4-6 people, great assortment of foods\nFalafel Salad - I can never have enough falafel, so even though these came on the Mixed Platter, I still craved more. The avocado salsa was subtle, much lighter, zestier than a guacamole.\nFeta Prawns - OMG. The four of us (2 guys/2 girls) couldn't stop sopping up the broth of this dish. Seriously, pita, falafel, spoons--it was so darn good (4 prawns).\n\nEntrees \nPasha bayildi - Scrumptious stuffed eggplant dish. Seemed kind of Italian meets Greek to me due to the red sauce. Still, delicious stuffing. Great portion for a vego\nMixed Grill - Yum. A generous mix of chicken, lamb & beef. Can't go wrong.\n\nWe shared everything and walked out just like Greek people...fat and happy. We also ordered beer, sparkling and red wine all by the glass. I was impressed by their selection and diversity of their by-the-glass list. Service was fast and efficient, not overly friendly, but not rude either. Just like I like it, there when you need 'em.

However, my experience at brunch yesterday was terrible. My friend and I came by for brunch around 10:30am. There was one bartender, one server and one busser on staff which is definitely where the problem began. We were seated by the busser (who was awesome, and shouldn't be blamed in any way for poor service), and had to wait a full 20 minutes before even being greeted by the server. I ordered a coffee and then proceeded to wait another 20 minutes for the cream I requested, which was useless by the time it arrived as the coffee was cold. The server who was absolutely spacey, took our orders without writing anything down which was also a red flag. When our food arrived, my order was completely wrong. The server repeatedly tried to shove an omelet in front of me while glaring at me as if I were incompetent. After I refused the food for the third time he finally decided to give me what I ordered (which took another 20 minutes). My friend was forced to wait for his food as well while mine was being re-prepared, but the server brought out his original plate of food which was freezing and congealed. The server then offered a rather muted apology and that was it. We were also not offered refills of coffee or water until we had paid the check. What was really devastating was that the table right next to us had the exact same thing happen but their messed up food was \"bought\" by the horrendous server. Seriously!? Why would I not get the same service? I haven't been this disappointed in a restaurant in a long time but in this case it was all the servers fault as the food was still good.

Rimon, the owner, is exceptionally friendly and very generous with the pours! Almost never too crowded, and way friendlier than Amelie. Live in the neighborhood, and this is now my neighborhood haunt.", "author": "Erik H."}

We had the Salmon, Chicken, and a vegetarian dish.  Great food.  We all shared, thus, I can vouch for all main dishes.  The cheesecake was just right.  Will return on my next trip to San Francisco.", "author": "A A."}

I will definitely head back again.", "author": "rachel s."}
