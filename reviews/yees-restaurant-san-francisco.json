On this day I came in for just something specific, Jook. That's rice porridge. I brought my girlfriend who is Hispanic and had never had rice porridge. She wanted to try it out and I took her here. I ended up not regretting that decision because we ordered the Jook with cod and it was fantastic. The fish was perfect and the rice and soup mixture was dead on. The thing that stand out is that the soup didn't taste like they used anything to make the porridge think. See some places will use gelatin to thicken up the porridge but not here. I also ordered a Singapore rice noodle, this is one of my favorite dishes to order when I go place and it was fantastic. Tons of shrimp and chashu in it. The price is one of the cheapest in the neighborhood (see my review for Yuet Lee). My girlfriend now is a fan of Jook and a fan of Yee's. So give this place a chance.", "author": "Patrick T."}

I was overwhelmed by just how many restaurants there were to choose from in SF Chinatown, but I decided on this one because of the tempting barbecued and roast meats hanging in the front window, the decent reviews, and the really cheap prices. We were quickly shown a seat inside and eventually caught the eye of someone who would take our order. Service is definitely not their strong point, but I wasn't expecting much for a Chinatown restaurant to start with, so eh. \n\nMy boyfriend and I split a two-meat combo plate of barbecued pork and roast duck, as well as the pan-fried noodles with seafood. I grew up eating pan-fried noodles with seafood at my favorite local Chinese restaurant, so this brought back fond memories, though I have to admit the fried noodles in their rendition were on the greasy side and the seafood sauce on top was pretty bland. My boyfriend didn't like it at all, but it was also his first time having this particular dish. We were satisfied with the amount of seafood in it though, and all of it was cooked well. The barbecued pork and roast duck were both delicious but very fatty compared to what I'm used to. Also, some pieces that had been sitting on the bottom in the salty greasy sauce they poured on top ended up being too salty, and by the end of our meal, it was just too much.  \n\nAll in all, I think we paid something like $15 total for our meal, not including tax + tip (can't remember anymore). Really cheap considering these were two plates full of food, and we had plenty of leftovers to take home. If you have more people, the 3 dishes for $20 deal is a real steal, but the menu for that doesn't include any bbq/roast meats, and that was what I was really there for. The inside is your typical Chinatown dump, but it seemed clean enough. The health score of 65 is a little concerning, but I didn't get sick from eating here, so I guess I won that game of Russian roulette. This place got packed around dinner-time, so it seems to be popular with the locals.

Unfortunately my dad is not around to enjoy the wondeful cuisine provided by this place. He's with God. God Bless. So in honor of him, I do this review. I would recommend this place for anyone looking to eat some quality Chinese food. It was our last day in S.F. and what to eat for dinner. Well, how about the place we dined here almost 20 years ago. Well, we came here by chance. We were strolling through chinatown and came across here. This is where we dined during our last night in S.F. on 2nd of Jan, 2017. Just come by and order the 3 dishes for  XX amount of dollars. They have the promotion where you order 3 dishes, you pay a certain price. of course we were hungry so we ordered 6 dishes. Soup is complimentary. We ate the Seafood tofu pot, Fish with bok choy, and some other dishes. The food is great. It's not your 5 star type restaurant, but it's definitely a family restaurant. The prices of the food is cheap, but the taste of the food is definitely good. During the day, there's a line outside waiting to get the BBQ food. They must be doing something right.", "author": "Arthur W."}

My first time here I watched a group of tourist pointing towards the duck hanging in the window before scurrying off into the night.\n\nThis visit I tried the yang chow fried rice.  The bbq pork was very good but this dish was too salty and not very good.  I also had the zongzi/Chinese tamale.  It was not very good as there were too many peanuts and that was the main flavor to the dish.\n\nFrom another visit:\nI ordered half a roast duck for $8 and bbq pork pan fried noodles for $6.  The roast duck was awesome!  Nice crispy skin with awesome flavor.  The meat was tender and delicious.  This is one of the best plates of roast duck I have ever had!  The pan fried noodles were very good.  This dish is similar to bbq pork chow mein dry style from Hong Kong bbq.\n\nFrom a previous trip:\nI tried the 3 dishes for $18 deal.  I picked mongolian beef, peking spareribs, and the salt and pepper wings.  The mongolian beef was tender, had good flavor, and a little kick to it.  The peking spareribs had a nice crust and tasty sauce drizzled on them.  This was my fav dish of the three.  The salt and pepper wings tasted like they may have been marinated in soy sauce before frying.  Very tasty.  This was alot of food with the addition of white rice and more than we could finish.  The only disappointing thing here is the tea.  I'm really picky about tea and I'm willing to pay for good loose leaf tea.  This tea was a real generic prebewed stuff that was sitting around in a warmer.\n\nOverall the bbq meats are awesome here but the other dishes are a bit off.  This place has great bang for the buck but you will find more refined non bbq meat dishes at places like Great Eastern.", "author": "Soo H."}

I suppose Yee's has been around for quite sometimes and the older generation seems to know a lot about them.  There is even a counterfeit restaurant with similar Chinese name around the corner on Broadway St.\n\nOne of their specialties here was the so-called Cantonese Roast Goose, and they were probably the only place that served them around here.  However, our traveling companion who is also a Chinese BBQ expert informed us that the goose was really a larger breed of duck with the beak trimmed off, and then they jacked up the price to like $20ish each, while duck was have sold for half as much.  Not off to a good start.\n\nRegardless, we tried some of their dishes.  The house veggie was ok.  Char Siu was a bit disappointing with an amateur usage of all part of the pig, but flavor was ok. House Noodles looked like a big mess, but it tasted ok though.  Their Roasted Duck was decent with crisp skin.  Soy Chicken was good as well.  We got the Sturgeon Deluxe, which came in a stir-fried dish and another cooked in soup.  The fish was a bit small though and the soup was not very good.\n\nI really want to like these traditional old town Chinese joint, they definitely has a lot of rich culture touch to them.  However, when they got questionable business practices and integrity like selling ducks pretending to be goose, it really got me thinking about the rest of things they sell.", "author": "Tony L."}

Grungy place so it's not surprising the health inspector wasn't happy recently. Had two Chinese beers and a generous bowl of See Sum Fun soup which is just chicken noodle soup with some pork thrown in for $13.60 before tip and that includes tea. Soup was mild so I added chili sauce which they had out. Don't expect fast service because it's rather chaotic but that was the charm for me, a white guy from Wisconsin.

You had me at 3 for $15.99.  And that is what we ended up ordering.  \n\n! - Shrimp with scramble eggs - it was a shame, this is one of my favorite dishes to eat.  The scramble eggs were over cooked or wasn't cooked the way I like them.  Usually, the eggs are soft and enhanced with chives with shrimp being the dominate flavor.  \n! - Beef and Chinese broccoli - this actually came out good.  I thought the broccoli was cooked perfectly and was fresh.  \n! - Seafood claypot - I guess you can't really go wrong with seafood clay pots.  They just dump everything in and cook it in some lovely sauce and BAM!  the flavors are all there.  This claypot had shrimp, calamari, cod fish, black mushrooms and 2 types of tofu.  \n\nI thought the food was a tad salty and I ended up ordering a diet coke for burpage.  I wanted to make sure the MSG didn't hit my head right away, I think bubbly coke can prevent headaches and potential stomach aches.  Otherwise, the portions are huge, the food comes out quickly, and the service is typical to all Chinese restaurants.  Okay and can be better.\n\nNOTES: Hole in the wall decor.

For me, authenticity is a big part of my cultural dining experiences, I hate chain restaurants (for the most part), and yuppie twists on traditional dishes, which worked in my favor here, because this place bleeds authentic Cantonese fare. As soon as you approach this place, all your senses start working in unison with one another;faster and faster as you quickly become enveloped in this world of deliciousness. your eyes are immediately drawn to the beautifully roasted pork and poultry items hanging in the window and as you make your way further into the restaurant; you can see even more delicious  slow roasted items being sliced and sold per pound. \n   The scents that travel through the air in this restaurant are magnificent enough to lift you off your feet, I can't say that any one scent is more recognizable than the others, but I can say that the collective culmination of all these together; will have your nose begging for more. Once you taste the food, everything will start to make sense, you will see just exactly why this place is always busy. I literally love every item here, but the chicken chow mein is always a favorite of mine, it's always made to order, seasoned/prepared well, and very filling.

However, if you can escape that stereotype, Yee's restaurant serves excellent food.  \n\nMy friends did the ordering since I do not speak Chinese (bad Asian).  We ordered Chinese cabbage, a noodle dish and goose.  Yes, I said goose.  What does goose taste like?  It taste like duck, but not as fatty.  I can review the other dishes we ordered but the goose was the absolute winner.  Juicy and tender and not fatty.  I could order a whole goose for myself and not share it with my friends.

I sampled my some of the roast duck noodle soup, the chicken noodle soup, and the BBQ pork noodle soup (all with flat rice noodles) and all were amazing.  The meats here are really top notch.  \n\n3. Portion size:  For the aforementioned low prices, you get a huge amount that will leave you very, very full and satisfied.  If you get the noodle bowls, they'll give you a large amount of meat and plenty of noodles.  You will definitely leave here weighing a little more than when you entered.\n\n4.

They served all wings and no drummettes at all unlike some restaurants tell you chicken wings but they included the drummettes.  Their roast duck is super juicy and definitely fattening.  We also ordered a fried flounder with sauce and the fish was huge.  Everything was very good for a very good price.\n\nAround evening time, they would chop up all the roasted stuff and sell it for $2.50 per plate.

I always hope the broth will be better but it is pretty unremarkable and bland. The wontons are decent and plump. Just add the meats to help flavor the broth. The roast duck is obviously oily but the ducks they use aren't grossly fatty. The other meats are flavorful and tender. Everyone eats for less than $10/person including a good tip.\n\nThey also have a 3 item special for under $20 for a lot of typical Cantonese dishes. You can feed 3-5 people this way. Jook is delicious and cheap. One of my fave dishes ended up being a simple shrimp egg omelet which was well seasoned and thin yet not overcooked. Around 2 or 3 pm, they start setting out small dishes of their excess roast meats and other dishes for a few bucks.

You can order the BBQ meats hanging in the window by the plate ($8-9), or order 1 or 2 meats over rice ($5-8). The food was pretty good and this place did get crowded on the Saturday night we were here. This place is cash only, like most of the places in Chinatown so don't come with just plastic! I would definitely return again if in San Francisco! We actually tried coming a few days later but it was too late in the evening and they had already closed (8:30ish pm)", "author": "Brian P."}

We got in right at noon and could get a table. The waiter was a bit slow in taking our order but the roast duck and roast pig were great. We also got the mixed veggies and an order of wonton noodle soup. Also very good. You can tell a restaurant is good in China town when they have the roast ducks hanging in the window. The price was under $35.00 for all of this which I consider a good deal. No dim sum, though, like Grant Place but we enjoyed the food and had a little to take home.

My parents and I come up to The City about once a month, and we've been here a few times. If my picky mother likes a place, then the quality measure is high and \"they must be good.\"\n\nLike someone said here - \"soul food Chinese style\" - and I think that they're pretty right-on, esp for the price.\n\nWe always get our roast pork from the deli here, and I'd venture to guess that the pigs that they use to roast seem smaller/younger, thus making the meat more tender and smooth, rather than the rough cardboard texture that you might get with an older/larger pig. It's almost always got the right amount of fat and the skin is consistently thick and crispy.\n\nThis might be considered a hole-in-the-wall, but I think is considered a step-above.\ni.e. \nno grime on the walls and a wait-staff that sits you down and serves you the food ;-)\n\nI've only tried one thing here, and that is the - ngow nam mein - fatty beef brisket/belly with thin egg noodles in soup. Not sure if it's on the menu, but my mom usually tells the waiter that's what we want. All I can say is that it comes out really good, and I think for what you get at $4.95 (the price that I remember), you get a good healthy bowl of it!\n\nI think that if you confidently know what you want (from having grown up Chinese!), and don't have reservations about ordering something that's not on the menu, see if they can do it! \n\nThrough the grapevine, I have heard that you can order (gee yuk biang) steamed pork hash if you ask for it!", "author": "Jimmy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-04", "description": "Yee's seems to get a lot of flak about the overall cleanliness of the restaurant... so to start off my 5-star review, I've added a disclaimer:\n\nAs a general rule at Canto restaurants, you just don't ask about the details of your food, as any honest answer is probably undesirable, ie:\n\n\"Is the pigeon meat fresh?\"\n\"Yes... probably. Locally-grown too.\"\n\nI personally love this place with all my heart. This is as authentic & tasty as Chinese food gets north of the Silicon Valley. Don't be fooled by its \"touristy\" location on Grant Ave. If you can't read Chinese, it's going to be pretty hard to order anything. \n\nAs a college student, I'm a sucker for the 3 for $15 meals, complete w/ soup, fruit & tea. My favorite 3 for $15 items are the salt&pepper pork spareribs, (fatty, salty, peppery soul food at its best) the ginger-scallion fried tilapia ($5 whole fish... enough said) the dry-cooked sichuan string beans, and the seafood-veggie pot (bubbling hot w/ bok choy, various mushrooms, fried soft tofu, squid & fish.) \n\nI've never gotten sick off the food; my (disclaimer: white) fiance has been here countless times and he's never gotten sick/nauseous either. I've taken my extended family here, and they all love it & agree that this sort of authentic Canto food can hardly be found anymore... :( Plus, when you branch off the $15 3-course meal and loosen your purse strings a little, the food is excellent! Stewed clams, tender braised pork, perfectly roasted duck... Yee's has an orgiastic selection of meats that correctly earned it mention in Frommers as one of the best Chinese \"meat delis\" in SF.\n\nFor the strong-stomached... keep coming. :) There's this incredible feeling of validation you get when you've come for the umpteenth time and the manager actually deigns to flash you a smile... it's as if you're one of them now! And when that happens, the food comes promptly, the orders aren't mixed up and you're even honored with a scrap or two of meat & squash floating in your complimentary soup. Major bragging rights for an ABC.\n\nOn the flip side, you should gauge your dining companions carefully before taking them here. As much fun as it is to introduce everyone & their mom to culinary Asia, it can be disconcerting to order your meal (over a formica tabletop plus the din of 100 other hungry, loud diners) and have it come out with head, innards & ovaries attached. Yee's is delicious, but the dining experience isn't for everyone. That being said, if you're Chinese, you have to like it. Seriously... it's like your birthright. \n\nTips: Come early during the day if you want fish- they sell out fast. Be nice & order in Chinese (if you can.) Try everything- it's all yummy. And...\n\nBottom Line: In the words of Josh D'Aluisio-Guerrieri- \"Find comfort in the fact that a billion people eat at places like this every day, but it isn't solving the probblem of overpopulation.\"", "author": "Tianyi S."}

I found this restaurant via another site's recommendation (I felt guilty for cheating on Yelp, of course) -- it fit the bill for location, price range and ratings, and if we go somewhere unfamiliar without a destination in mind, we tend to wander aimlessly until we finally turn on each other in a low-blood-sugar rage, like crazed jackals.  \n\nYee's was not the absolute best Chinese food I've ever had in my life (that was in a hole-in-the-wall somewhere in the city which I'll never find again ... sort of a Brigadoon thing, I suspect), but it was very good.  Everyone found something they liked, there was a wide variety of dishes, the waiter was helpful, the food wasn't greasy (one of my pet peeves), we didn't feel rushed or ignored even though it was close to closing time, and the price?  Phenomenal.  Four of us -- all big strapping corn-fed hearty eaters of Chinese food -- ate until we were stuffed, with two containers of leftovers, for *forty dollars*.  Srsly.  \n\n- Pot stickers:  these were the weakest link, since they were sort of doughy, but the flavor was excellent and the price was right\n- Char siu:  big portion, very juicy, holds up favorably to my companion's exacting char siu standards (he's kind of a char siu maven)\n- Eggplant with salted fish and chicken:  the waiter warned us that this was \"smelly\", but we braved it.  Smelly, yes, but the flavor is good and the eggplant's flavor and texture were especially nice\n- Some kind of rice noodle dish with beef:  again, great flavor; a little light on the beef\n- Mongolian beef:  excellent, albeit an awful lot of onions\n- Green beans with minced pork:  fantastic!  spicy without being overwhelming, more meat than we expected (and little slices of pork, not hamburger-sized-crumbly-bits as the name might suggest\n\nThey brought us some amazing melon (in lieu of fortune cookies) with the check, which made a good contrast to the meal.  Also, free melon! \n\nI'd definitely recommend Yee's just for the food, but the location is also excellent -- easy to find (near Grant and Columbus) and close to other interesting stuff.", "author": "Sue G."}

The workers there were just sitting there, watching us but not even saying anything. Then finally, this one guy comes up to us and finally serves us. My boyfriend ordered Beef with Broccoli and I ordered Beef with bell peppers in black bean sauce. It was $5 for each so I thought that it couldn't be that bad considering that there were many people in there. When we got the rice plates, it looked decent. Though looks can be deceiving! The meat was hot but the rice was warm. The sauce was very bland and it seemed like they just put soy sauce over the warm rice that they probably just microwaved. My boyfriend's plate was a bit better than mine...considering the fact that I found a bell pepper produce sticker still attached to the bell pepper piece that I almost ate. I was absolutely petrified because I don't know where that's been. Also, if there was a sticker on the bell pepper, maybe they didn't even wash the bell pepper before they cooked it! Anyways, I complained to the lady that was working there and she didn't really say much about it. She didn't even try to take responsibility for it at all or offer a refund.

My dad had the \"Vegetarian,\" which included seaweed, and he was pretty stoked about that.\n\nI asked the waiter what the most popular thing was that people ordered, and he said the roasted meats, namely the duck, goose, pork. I ordered the duck with rice, and there was not quite enough rice, but the duck was excellent (though very fatty - I got a bit of a stomach ache later on. Think Whitecastle's sliders...yeah). I forgot to ask whether they used MSG, but I couldn't taste any, and I didn't get that weird sleepy feeling afterward that MSG gives me.\n\nUnlimited tea, though I guess pretty typical, was a nice treat on a long day of walking.\n\nI'd recommend it if you'd like a low-cost Chinatown lunch to offset the cost of those pricey Ghiradelli ice cream treats and boat rides around the bay.

The Chinese name is pronounced Mun Jai Gei Siu Lap Cha Chaan Teng. First three characters is like \"Little Mun's\" (or \"Mun-chan\" in Japanese speak). Siu Lap referring to the fact that this place specializes in Cantonese style ROASTIES. Cha Chaan Teng is a Hong Kong style cafe that typically serves a mish mash of Cantonese Chinese and HK style western. \n\nSo once again, a generic name like Yee's Restaurant doesn't tell you anything else.\n\nFrom what I remember about Yee's, they don't have a HK style western side to their menu, and perhaps the substitute to that is roasties.  I can't remember if they have HK milk tea and if they did, whether it was worth the bother.\n\nSo if you're here to cure hunger pains, prefer something that's good value (i.e. half decent to decent portions but not sextacular refinement) then Little Mun's will roast and pork you in the stomach.\n\nCongee was not earth shattering here, just hit the spot, but didn't produce those orgasms like at Hing Lung (which they are more well known for orgasmic creamy congee that takes your high to the clouds).\n\nIf this place were in the South Bay or Peninsula, for sure it would rate a lot higher.", "author": "Ken K."}

The beef ly fun is to die for with tender marinaded beef and light ly fun with that golden wok taste.  The kung pao chicken is tender with mushrooms, peppers, celery, carrots, and peanuts in a chili sauce that packs a bit of spice but not like at a Szechwan restaurant as this is a Cantonese restaurant.

We tried to go to R&G Lounge, where I was told that they were \"full\" when I inquired how long the wait would be. Hmph ...\n\nSo, onward we pushed with our empty stomachs for some din-din. Lucky for us, the cuz had a trick up his sleeve and took us to Yee's Restaurant. After getting over the initial shame of letting him down and having to rely on a kid who had only been in the City a mere 4 days to show US around ... I stepped boldly into Yee's with a skeptical mind. After all, what did a 20-year old Caucasian boy know about good Chinese food, right?!\n\nWell, I could not be more proud of him! Yee's is a GREAT family restaurant with flavorful, authentic food at incredible prices. If you go there, you MUST have an open mind about the service & decor - neither of which is anything to write home about. Their seating system, or lack thereof, can be a bit frustrating as it basically consists of standing around waiting for a table to open and hoping that the staff remembers you were here before the people next to you. The chairs & tables receive the cursory wipe down after each patron leaves.\n\nBUT if you can see past these two elements, you are in for a treat. We dined on the 3 for $15.99 dinner menu. The cuz really wanted the char siu, which was good - a little fatty but cooked perfectly so that it wasn't dry. We also had the mixed seafood with vegetables dish - squid (again, cooked perfectly and not chewy), shrimp & bok choy - fresh & flavorful. The final dish was the black pepper chicken (or was it pork?). Regardless, it was DEE-LISH. Very peppery.\n\nAdd to that incredible value, the free soup at the start of the meal (any place that will include the chicken head in the soup means serious business, I say) and free watermelon at the end of the meal (who needs fortune cookies?!), and you've got yourself one heck of a meal for under $20.", "author": "Lynn H."}

The portions are large, the service is good, and the prices are very friendly. The set menu for a three course lunch is under $7.00.\nWe always order a big bowl of their wonton, noodle, and pork soup and that is\nunder $7.00 (that is in itself a meal for two). The last trip there, we had the soup,\na  ala carte dish of sweet and sour pork, and a bowl of rice. We had enough\nleft over for a doggie bag. The price of this banquet was under $15.00.

This place is cheap - especially with their 3 entrees for $15.99 deal though with a catch that I will go into later.\n\nFirst visit came after a whole day of sightseeing throughout the SF area.  Lots of walking from Nob Hill to Fisherman's Wharf, Ghiradelli Square, Pier 39, North Beach, and all over Chinatown.  Finally decided on Yee's as we wanted to dine at a \"hole-in-the-wall\" place full of locals.  Placed two take-out orders of their roast duck + roast pork over rice combos ($7.50 with tax each as of 6/19).  Unfortunately, they were out of roast pork so substituted with bbq pork (i.e. the red pork).  The pork was good, no complaints there.  Although the duck was tasty and cooked well, they were on the extremely small/not meaty side.  One thing we really liked about the take out order was that they actually included bok choy with the rice!  The veggie made the takeout order into a more complete meal, i.e. meats, rice, and veggie.  The sauce that was poured over the rice was quite good as well, just wished the duck was meatier.\n\nSecond visit was a sit-down dinner.  Went for the 3 entrees for $15.99 deal plus a couple of additional dishes.  Before I go into that, we were pleasantly surprised that we were given a free bowl of artichoke soup/broth.  It was a very simple soup with a couple of pieces of artichokes, but good.  As for the dinner, we got 1) Deep Fried Flounder with sauce 2) Salt & Pepper Shrimp 3) Seafood Tofu Clay Pot  4) Kong Xin Cai 5) Whole Roast Duck.  The last two items were not from the $15.99 deal.  First, the fish was quite small while the salt/pepper shrimp was overcooked as they came out soaking in oil.  The seafood tofu claypot, though good, was NOT a claypot.  It was a mere mini metal wok.  The most disappointing was the duck.  For a whole duck, it was really devoid of meats.  It actually looked like half a duck - for $7/duck I guess that is to be expected.\n\nAs with most \"hole-in-the-wall\" restaurants in Chinatown, there was only one bathroom per sex and it was essentially a closet.  To get to it, you must walk through the dish-washing part of the kitchen with dirty/used plate/bowls stacked everywhere.  I got so tired of waiting to wash my hands in the bathroom that I just washed them over the industrial sized kitchen sink.  \n\nOverall, the dinner was somewhat disappointing, not bad, but also not great.  Came out to about $45.  Decent meal - A-OK.  Bear in mind - cash only.", "author": "Melvin B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-06-11", "description": "Yee's restaurant is a solid, unpretentious Cantonese restaurant in the heart of Chinatown where you can get a good, simple meal at an extremely reasonable price.   The restaurant is popular with Chinatown residents, which speaks volumes about the quality.  There is also a Chinese BBQ on the premises, with the usual \nchar siu pork, duck, chicken, and cuttlefish gracing the front window.\n\nSure, you can get sweet-and-sour pork, but during lunchtime, most folks gravitate towards the rice plates; the fish fillet and vegetables over rice seem popular, while I prefer the BBQ pork and duck with rice.  Most rice plates are $7 or less and include a large bowl of soup (the composition of which seems to vary day by day, but seems to include\nlotus root and pork neck bones; it's always quite good). You can watch as the BBQ meats are unhooked, chopped, and plated for your table, so the meats are a low-risk path to a good meal.\n\nthere is also a $15-for-3-dishes option, where you select from any 3 items from a substantial menu.  I've only tried a few of them (Chinese broccoli, BBQ pork, and braised tofu), but they were all solid and the ingredients were fresh. there are many more items on the menu, and I bet there are several culinary gems hidden within.\n\nall in all, if you're looking for a good, unpretentious meal,  try Yee's.

The real draw to Yee's for me has always been their breakfast jok special.  For the ungodly price of $2.50 (if my memory serves me right), one gets a HUGE bowl of jok with yao ja guai on the side (or cut-up into the jok).  Additionally, one can have anything from shredded pork to thousand-year egg in your jok.  So, for your two-fifty, you tend to get a lot.  As well, Yee's duck is a treat, either to eat there or to take home.\n  So, Yee's is yet my favorite little place but, who knows, if I find myself going there more and more, the tides may turn!", "author": "Scott N."}

We wanted to add a particular item to a dish, and no matter how hard we tried, he would not accommodate to our liking. He just kept nodding, NO! NO! NO!.  A bit rude I would say. A lady came out with all kinds of dishes for a special price, like goose feet, chicken wings, and sweet and sour pork, which was all set up on two large tables. I noticed everyone was grabbing something, so I went up to the lady who was preparing the plates what were these particular dishes. And she stared me like I was crazy. I did spoke to her in cantonese, but she seemed disturbed like I have the nerve to ask her about the dish or the prices of each item. Eventually I took a plate home for my dad to eat cause he loves goose feet. The food was pretty good, but the service leaves me totally disturbed. I have never encounter such rudeness in my life. My husband plate had arrived 20 minutes earlier while I sat there watching him eat, before my plate arrives.
