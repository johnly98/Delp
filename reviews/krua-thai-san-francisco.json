Since it is the closest restaurant to my house, I have visited it a lot in the past few months. Sometimes for takeout, and sometimes to dine in. The takeout is always ready very quickly- and if for some reason it isn't, they will bring you a glass of water and let you sit at a table while you wait, which is not necessary but is very nice. \n\nMy favorite thing on the menu is by far the green curry. It's spicy, flavorful, creamy, and full of crunchy fresh vegetables. I always get it with tofu, and they are generous with how much tofu they put inside. I also really, really like the drunken noodles. The portion size is very reasonable and can last for a couple of meals, for a decent price. The Krua special Crispy Chicken is extremely delicious as well, although a bit dry, so I would recommend having that with a curry or something more vegetable heavy and moist. \n\nOverall, I have really been impressed by Krua Thai lately, and felt that I should update my review. This is quickly becoming one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the area!", "author": "Ayushi A."}

I showed up to find that Krua Thai is now closed on Wednesdays, as of a few weeks ago. What? Why did they let OpenTable book a reservation, if they were going to be closed? Why did I go through the reservation confirmation step if the restaurant wasn't even going to be open? Why didn't they check to see what reservations were coming through for days that they planned to close, and let me know? \n\nIt's a massive inconvenience to show up with 10 people and then have to last minute find another restaurant and make sure that everyone gets there; that's why we made a reservation at this restaurant.

Came around dinner time on a Saturday early evening with a group of 8 people and we were seated right away. Our servers seemed very happy to see us and was very welcoming. The interior is beautiful and has a nice modern aesthetic. I don't usually comment on bathrooms, but it was one of the nicest restaurant bathrooms I've seen in a while. There was also this huge candle that smelled so nice.\n\nI split the Crab Fried Rice with a friend, which was pretty good. Never had crab in my fried rice but I'm here for it now.

We were able to score a reservation for 3 at Krua with ease. \n\nThe dining room was almost full early on a Saturday night. The decor and ambiance is relaxed and basic- not stuffy or trendy. The food and service are the stars here. \n\nWe ordered egg rolls and a bottle of wine to start our table off with. Our server was attentive and quick. We ordered three dishes to share family style, which came in a timely fashion. The green beans, pineapple rice, and drunken noodles were excellent! The beans were cooked to perfection and not drenched in oil.

A small cucumber salad and a side of soy sauce come with the Sampler.\nI then chose from the \"Saut\u00e9ed\" section of the menu and ordered the\nBroccoli (Chinese/American broccoli).   This dish included saut\u00e9ed broccoli with carrots, baby corn, and mushrooms in a light brown sauce.\nI added chicken and prawns.  Jasmine rice was the accompaniment.\nIt was light, flavorful and quite healthy.  I wished there was a bit more sauce that was served so I could soak up the rice. \n\nService was great and the restaurant was very clean.  There is an extensive menu of traditional Thai plates.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-13", "description": "I came here for what was supposed to be a quick, easygoing dinner as I love Thai food and I like to treat myself to it after a long day's of work sometimes. Instead, what I experienced at Krua Thai left me annoyed and unhappy with both the food and the service. \n\nFor a Monday night, they were pretty busy but they chose to only have two servers for the entire restaurant.\nRight away, when I walked in, I knew my boyfriend and I were in trouble when they shoved us in the back corner of the restaurant. Soon, they forgot about us and I had to try to flag them down multiple times to get my food order in. Even after I placed my order, they forgot to ask me for water and walked away. I was super thirsty but by the time I realized that they didn't provide water, it was too late. The server walked away. Again, more attempts to flag them down.\n\nWhen our appetizer came out, it was a small bowl of prawn Tom Yum soup. I was very disappointed in the soup as it costs $7.50 for a small, one person bowl that contained three small mushrooms (sliced- not whole) and three prawns. The broth itself was not good- it was bland compared to other Tom Yum soups I've had in my life.\n\nAfter we ate our soup, we continued to wait for another 20 minutes before they showed up with two entrees- both were NOT what we ordered. They realized that they gave us the order for another table and walked away. I soon realized that the food they brought out was served for a table that placed their orders after ours. I was a little peeved about this fact but I was willing to let it go as I thought my food was coming out soon. NOPE. It took another 15 minutes of waiting and waiting before I finally flagged them down at least twice requesting the status of our food. One of the younger, more inexperienced female servers simply nodded when I asked her about the status and walked away without a follow up. Finally, the more experienced server saw me waving at her and went back to the kitchen to find out the status of our dishes.\n\nOur food finally came out 45 minutes after our initial order- which some of you may think is not long, but when you consider the fact that my boyfriend and I ordered the most basic food to make at Thai restaurants- fried rice and Pad Thai- you would be pretty upset too.\n\nWhen we finally had the chance to eat our fried rice and Pad Thai, we were sorely disappointed at the quality of food. Both dishes were bland, especially the Pad Thai. It is very hard to mess up on Pad Thai but somehow, they did. \n\nTo add more insult to our dinner, as my boyfriend and I were halfway eating our entrees, the inexperienced, young female server I mentioned above suddenly dropped off a check and SOMEONE ELSE'S credit card while we were clearly still not done with our food. She didn't bother to ask us questions- just a drop of the credit card and walked away. I didn't even have a chance to tell her about her mistake. I had to turn over to another table nearby and asked them if it was their credit card. Let's just say that the people at that table were not thrilled that their credit card was randomly left with strangers. \n\nSo, the moral of this review for Krua Thai is that if you want to experience bland Thai food and terrible customer service, come here. Otherwise, AVOID.", "author": "Khanh T."}

I've tried several others, but they've been hit or miss, executing one dish perfectly while leaving another devoid of flavor.  \n\nUntil the other night, when I tried Krua Thai for the first time!!!  I've walked past this restaurant a thousand times, always noting the modern, trendy decor that feels more like an upscale hotel lounge than a hipster-laden Mission restaurant...which is maybe why it's almost empty every time I pass by.  Upon first glance, I assumed it would be an overpriced clip-joint like Osha Thai, but the prices were a little more mild, and so I put it in the back of my head as a place to try some time.\n\nI never actually made it in.  Instead, I ordered take-out when a friend was in town who wanted to hang out at my apartment.  Among those of us at dinner, we ordered a smattering of options to share:  \n\nThe Curry Samosas were delicious and not too spicy, perfect for someone like me who prefers her food mild.  It's a nice way to start dinner for someone who DOES like spice, but doesn't want to blow out their taste buds with a ton of heat on just the appetizer.\n\nThe Spicy Basil Fried Rice had excellent flavor, although it was too hot for my palate...but made everyone else in the room very happy!!\n\nThe Chicken Pad Thai was flavorful and delicious...not the usual flat noddles I'm used to, but the thinner, square-shaped type.  I prefer the former, but everything else about the dish was delish!\n\nThe Chicken Yellow Curry was so nicely flavored without being too spicy!  They seemed to use white meat, if this matters to you.\n\nBut the clear star of the night was the \"KRUA\" Fried Rice with Roasted Duck...Mmmmm!!!!!  Fried rice can often be really bland and too oily, but this was neither!  There were large pieces of duck, lots of egg, and just enough tomato, cucumber, and onion...So good!!  \n\nThe next time I have a yearning for Thai food, this will be my first call...and who knows, maybe next time I'll actually eat-in at the restaurant, since it looks so nice inside!", "author": "Amy L."}

You're an Osha! Wouldn't you like to be an Osha, too? Be an Osha. Eat at an Osha!\" Because not only are there numerous Osha Thais in operation downtown but a lot of Osha Thai wannabes that try hard for the same cosmopolitan Bangkok-meets-West Elm effect (photo: http://bit.ly/TRXLjx). And you can add one more to the list, this trendy spot on 16th right off Guerrero offering a middling execution of the standard dishes. Jamie W. and I tried it when we noticed that Ramen Izakaya Goku was full up one evening.\n\nIt was quiet in there, no more than two other tables were occupied in a rather large space for the Mission. The menu listed several options including a Mix and Match section where you make your choice of meat (or non-meat) and decide what kind of preparation you want and with what side dish. Rice comes with it no matter what you order. I went to town and ordered the premium-priced $14 Duck prepared as a Cashew Nuts Platter with onions, mushrooms and carrots in that mystery \"brown sauce\" that apparently infiltrates the entire Asian continent (photo: http://bit.ly/1ueV9qS). It would have been fine if they didn't forget my nuts. No, I didn't forget my nuts. THEY forgot my nuts...for a change.\n\nJamie decided to mitigate the risk by ordering his stand-by, the $9 Drunken Noodles with Chicken (photo: http://bit.ly/1v9u7nd). Even though the execution was predictable, he at least knew what he was getting. And he got his chicken. As a shared side, we tried the $7.50 Cream Cheese Taffies, a dessert that lost its way to the menu and became an appetizer. They were deep-fried won tons stuffed with cream cheese with a bit of crab meat and onion accompanied by a sweet and sour dipping sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1sbkRkz). They were odd confections that could have been more savory to sync up with the rest of the meal. Anyway, kudos to the cleanest restroom in all of the Mission. Jamie and I were both impressed with the spa-like ambiance in there.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...cream cheese and no nuts\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...cheers for the restroom...otherwise, wouldn't you like to be an Osha, too?\nSERVICE - 3 stars...they are a bit off here\nTOTAL - 3 stars...another Osha wannabe", "author": "Ed U."}

Sure enough, the brand specialized in tart flavors. Then she got a champagne which she was happier with. They have a good selection of wines and beer. We ordered a large Tom Yum Soup with Seafood, Shrimp Pad Thai and Chicken Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles). The soup was tasty but there was hardly anything it in, just a few pieces of seafood and some mushrooms. No tomatoes and there weren't very many mushrooms. The Pad Thai was good but the Pad Kee Mao had the perfect amount of spiciness to it.

I have lived in San Francisco my entire life and there are only a handful of good Thai restaurants - this is in my top 3! I randomly stumbled upon this place via open table and am so happy that I did! \n\nThe first time I came here, my mom and I ordered their papaya salad, drunken noodles and a veggie sriracha dish. Every single bite that we had, we loved. Everything was full of amazing AND authentic flavor. All of the ingredients were very fresh and I loved how the vegetables weren't overcooked - there was still a slight crunch in every bite. I highly recommend ordering those items, especially the papaya salad - the best papaya salad I have tasted in SF (and that's a bold statement)! \n\nThe second time I came here was with my best friend for lunch. We both checked in on yelp and our meal was $7, instead of $10. Their lunch special is incredible - it comes with soup, an appetizer and a main dish. We had their tom yum (SO good, I wanted to order a whole bowl), grab and cheese wonton (I forget the actual name that this place calls it) and their green / pumpkin curry. I had the green curry with tofu/veggies and loved every bite of it. I recommend ordering their brown rice (extra $1). \n\nService is excellent. Jack has been our waiter the past two times and he is so nice and knowledgeable. Always has a smile on his face and makes the dining experience at this place that much better! Whenever I would ask for a recommendation, he was always honest.

However, nothing caught my eye on the menu until I read Krua CRISPY PAPAYA salad and CRISPY PAD THAI. Love places when they can get creative yet keep a dish in its naturalness. Since then I've had my eye to come here and then BAM there was a deal. You've been Scoutmob'ed and scored 50% off. \n\n*pictures are posted*\n\n- Food, yummy. very similar to osha but i think i like kura better\n- Prices, affordable (lunch)\n- Service, on-point. very into catering their customers. \n- Ambiance, simple chic and modernized\n\nFOOOOOD adventure!!!! Walking around the city on a beautiful Saturday on one of my solo journeys, decided to get up on my deals and make the best of it. The best time to use a deal is during lunch and decided to come here right when they open, 11:30AM to get my grub on. Not alot of people where there, unlike evenings. Small space but plenty of tables to sit at. Lovely decor and very clean. Seated by the window and was served like a queen.\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nKRUA CRISPY PAPAYA SALAD w/ PRAWNS ($8) - Crispy papaya topped with garlic, thai chili, tomatos, and peanuts in lime dressing. I love papaya salad but never had a crispy papaya salad. And i'm picky because some salads can have an overpowering dressing, but at Krua, they made it very good. CRISPY!!! that's a first. They deep fry the shreds of papaya but everything else is like a normal papaya sald. It came with 3 large prawns. The only annoying thing about eating the papaya salad was that each strand stuck to each other so when getting a bite, it was the entire thing and I had to use my fingers to pry a portion off and onto my fork. Besides that, it was yummy. The portion can be shared with another but since it was just me, it was large. Enough to pack 3/4 of it to take home.\n\nGINGER AND SCALLIONS w/ chicken and 2 taffies ($10) - W-O-R-T-H-Y!!!! soup, salad, appetizer, and main dish with rice.This is an item on the lunch menu. served with house soup, side salad, choice of 2 cripsy egg rolls or samosa or taffies, or shumai, and rice. Also choice of chicken, beef, pork or tofu & vegetables. Like usually, i went with chicken. You ask what are taffies? GET THEM. Taffies are like crab ragoon, they are crispy wontons filled with cream cheese, crab meat, and green onion, servered with sweet and sour sauce. My main dish was typical tasting, tasted like any other thai restaurant. But it was very fresh and delicious - maybe because I was there right when they opened and everything was just made fresh.\n\nSANGRIA ($6) - very delicious sangria. lots of fruits and the merlot was infused well, tasted like JUICE. Didn't have dessert, no room, but this was basically my dessert. \n\nMy bill came out to $24 dollars even but with the 50% discount, it came up to $12/$13 after tax. Absolutely, I scored on this food adventure.\n\nWill I be back? YES. I'd love to come back and try the crispy pad thai.\n\nJABA APPROVED. Until the next review...", "author": "Jane A."}

It was rainy and cold outside, and I was looking forward to warming up with some amazing Thai food. \n\nOur server was very attentive; maybe even too attentive. There weren't very many customers in the restaurant when we were there, so he came to take our orders within two minutes of our arrival. We weren't ready, so we asked him to come back later. Until we looked over and signaled to him ten minutes later, he was waiting patiently behind us just staring at us. Perhaps he could have gone into the kitchen for a while instead of standing there looking at us.\n\nTo eat, I had the Hot Red Curry with chicken. The food was brought out to us really quickly. What was surprising was that the food was not hot (in temperature or in spice). How could the food be lukewarm? It's not like it was sitting sitting out for thirty minutes or something. If they are cooking the food fresh, it just does not seem possible that the food could cool down to that temperature in such a short amount of time. It's really suspicious. \n\nWhile the curry was neither hot nor spicy, it did have a nice flavor profile. The curry comes with a good variety of fresh vegetables (peas, carrots, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, bell peppers, and basil leaves) too. \n\nI don't think I would come here again for dinner. Maybe if I lived in the area, I might order to-go and heat up the curry at home over the stove and add some spices.", "author": "Ravi S."}

Or like the Seinfeld soup nazi, without the good food.\n\nGirlfriend and I ordered food to go, took it home 20 min away, and discovered it was not good despite positive yelp reviews.  It's like going to see that movie you've been wanting to see and being disappointed when you actually see it. \n\nSo we called back and said we weren't happy.  The man on phone asked us to bring the food back.  But we were already home so we asked for a credit.  Up to this point, the conversation was fine.\n\nBut this is where things take a turn for the crazy.\n\nThe man on phone said we were \"one of those customers,\" that tries to just get free food.  We were flabbergasted - who makes a presumption like that and voices it to a customer?  \n\nWe said that was rude, we are customers voicing our concern with the food.  We wanted to give the restaurant another shot.\n\nAs we said this, the man on phone started talking over us.  \n\nSo we asked for his name and to speak with his manager. The man wouldn't give us his name, and hung up on us. Seriously? \n\nWe then decided to go back to the restaurant and complain to the manager about the man on the phone, just about principle at this point.\n\nWe get to the restaurant, see the man who answers the phone, and find he IS the manager. \n\nWe told him again why we were dissatisfied with the food, and we didn't appreciate how he insulted us and hung up.\n\nHe didn't apologize for his food or his behavior.  He claimed he hung up because he had a lot of other calls. Pretty sure you don't ever hang up on a customer. \n\nHe said he could refund us if we leave his restaurant.  So we said ok, we didn't like his food anyway.\n\nHe said the food is the way it is, and kept talking.  One of his employees touched him on the chest, like \"stop\", and he stormed off.\n\nThe employee had to step in and process the refund, and apologized the food wasn't what we expected, and apologized for the inconvenience. \n\nOverall the big picture is this: customers bring you money.  It's cheaper to keep a customer than acquire one.  And a pissed off customer tells way more people about their bad experience than happy customers: this one definitely is going to be a fun story to share.  So why would you insult a customer, treat them rudely, and make no effort to keep them, especially on their first trip?  Shockingly unprofessional - doesn't make sense.  \n\nThe manager should go back to being a house cat. Reow.", "author": "Charlie B."}

The staff were friendly and attentive.\n\nA waiter suggested we start off with the Cream Cheese Taffies, which are priced at a pretty steep price of $7.50. As promised, though, it was a unique and delicious appetizer that was perfect to start off the meal. The crispy won ton taffies are filled with rich cream cheese, crab meat, and green onions. It only comes with a small portion of five: a good thing because it's a pretty rich and heavy appetizer, but a bad thing considering the price of them. \n\nI then chose to get the Drunk Noodles, which is one of their signature entree items. To be quite honest, I couldn't tell the difference between their noodles and chow fun. The noodles and accompanying vegetables weren't well-cooked and it made a struggle to finish the plate. I tried my friend's Pad Thai and was disappointed by how they cooked a signature dish like that. \n\nWe also had the Thai iced tea, which was good but a little overly sweet. We ended the night with a classic Thai dessert, sticky rice and mango. The mango was very sweet and tasty, but the sticky rice was coated in a sauce that seemed like condensed milk.

It's delicious!  I make a note in my order each time that I have allergies, just in case.  However, they're always very proactive and often include a sticky note saying that their curry dish is by standard gluten and dairy free (although they haven't lately, but I assume that's only because of how often I order, they probably know me by now).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-31", "description": "Gertrude Stein once said of Oakland, \"There is no there there\", and I believe the same could be said of Krua Thai. I should have been tipped off by the fact that at 3pm on a Saturday afternoon this place was absolutely empty, even when being listed on Scoutmob, but I am a thrifty bitch and it's in my neighborhood, so that's how I found myself eating here.\n\nI had the Chicken Satay appetizer, which was pretty standard for a Thai restaurant, but I've never really understood these skewers. Restaurants pound the chicken meat so that it's thinner and then impale it on these flimsy wooden sticks, and when I bite into the skewer to pull a piece off, I often wonder if I'm going to get a splinter in my mouth. Maybe this is an irrational fear, but there has to be a better way to do this. \n\nJust like you can tell whether a pizza place is good by trying their basic Margherita, curries are a good starting point for any Thai restaurant. At the moment, my favorite is Penang Curry, and this one did not measure up to some of the better ones I've had in town. \n\nWhile they will vary differently (Thai House in the Castro's contains no vegetables and is a rich reddish orange, King of Thai Noodle's does contain veggies and is just a shade lighter than peanut butter) the flavor notes are generally consistent: Chili paste, peanut, lime, fish sauce, coconut milk. You might get coriander or garlic or galangal, but this particular Penang Curry at Krua was imbued with an odd flavor like cilantro or mint. It was loaded with slices of onion, carrot, and green peas. I ordered mine with chicken, and it had an odd, almost rubbery texture to it. I ate it all; it wasn't awful, it just wasn't what I expected.\n\nI finished off lunch with a heaping scoop of coconut ice cream topped with chocolate sauce. Now we're talking! The coconut ice cream was quite good, with large chunks of sweet coconut meat  throughout, and the little bit of chocolate drizzled on top was the perfect counterpart, like eating a Mounds bar without all the preservatives.\n\nWhen it comes to decor, Krua is well-appointed, but more for a wine bar or a European aesthetic, and even the music they choose to play reflects that. If you walked in and hadn't seen the menu, you'd think you just stepped into a boutique hotel bar and not a Thai restaurant. I'm not saying the place needs to be festooned with batiks and elephant memorabilia, but it could use a little more warmth. \n\nI love Thai food, and while this wasn't the worst I've had, it's not likely to be someplace I'll return to. It's not so much that it was bad, it just wasn't particularly good. There is no there there.", "author": "Josh J."}

But I didn't really have any place in mind, felt like trying somewhere new but didn't wanna spend a ton of money either. So I check in on Scoutmob, see which new places they're promoting, scroll past a place called Krua Thai, never heard of it before, but read the review, then check out what people on Yelp are saying about it, and figured you know what - with this Scoutmob 50% off discount, I can try the place out at very low risk, so why not? Plus, the pix online looked like it was one of those cool, trendy Thai places, so off we go.\n\nDrive past it a couple of times looking for parking (this is near the Valencia corridor after all), was about to give up and go home, but lo and behold, a parking spot opens up a block away. Park, walk to the venue and as soon as we walk in, I think i'm gonna like this place - smells good, looks cool/hip, and we are greeted with smiles right at the door. The fiancee turns to me and tells me she likes it so far, so I'm already playing with house money. \n\nSit down to order and the menu is right up our alley - the spicy items are denoted with anywhere from 1 to 3 asterisks, with 1 being spicy, and 3 being Thai spicy. Yeah buddy, my kinda place! The asterisks mean that our menu is very manageable - only look for the dishes with 3 notches, we're goin' in on the spice, yo! Settle on steamed Shumai to start - delicious, tasty, with just enough spiciness to warm up our palettes. Then we were planning to order Zesty beef and an order of Hot Basil Chicken (we always order hot basil chicken, we know it's safe). The waitress steered us from the Hot Basil chicken - it's very good, she says, but most of my customers love the Crispy Chicken with Basil even more. SOLD! Make it extra spicy (only had level 2 spiciness on the menu) and let's do this - I LOVE when a waitress makes a recommendation like that, way to take charge! \n\nAnyways, the food was DELICIOUS! Very spicy, but not too spicy we couldn't enjoy it (BEWARE - I LOVE spicy food, the spicier the better, so \"very spicy\" for me means \"way too spicy\" for a lot of people, just FYI). Flavorful. The crispy chicken had a crispy, sauce-covered skin to it, the Zesty beef was, um, very zesty! Plate sizes were perfect - not too much to feel overwhelmed, but just enough to make you feel like you were gonna need to walk the meal off for a bit. And washed it down with a Singha, perfect combo! \n\nThe bill came, told the waiter we were dropping Scoutmob on 'em, and boom, bill came back adjusted, we were all in for 35 bones including tip! Now THAT is what I call a Friday night! This is marketing at its best - Krua Thai just got a new customer because they partnered up with Scoutmob to give me a discounted try of their food.

The food is usually fine, but last night was unforgivable. I won't be coming back.  40 minutes after placing our order, a different waiter approaches us, telling us our order was never placed and asks us to repeat it.  10 minutes later our food arrives, only it's not what we ordered. They did not come by our table once to check in, so we ended up just eating the wrong order.  Eventually one of the waiters does a drive by and throws the check on the table - for the entire amount of this wrong, very late order (to my surprise.)  I eventually flag down a waiter and ask how we will be compensated for the awful dining experience.  He hurriedly takes away the check and comes back 2 minutes later with a 15% discount.  The food is NOT worth it.  I'll be waiting for a table at Lers Ros from now on.", "author": "Brianna B."}

Anyhow I came here for lunch today as I saw they were on Scoutmob at 50% off and I know I've driven by this place a lot of times and always wanted to give it a shot.\n\nI ended up ordering the lunch special like others have recommended in their reviews and it comes with an appetizer, salad, soup, rice, and a choice of an entree.  The soup was brought out first in a deep square bowl and it was just ok, a bit on the heavy side if you asked me in regards to a vegetable soup and it had a blast of cilantro here and there.  I also got a Thai Iced Tea.\n\nFor my choices I ordered the Samosa appetizer, which was quite tasty and you get 2 small empanada like samosas, got the sticky rice which was suppose to be the same price as the jasmine rice according to the menu but they charged me an extra $1 (hmmm....), and for the entree I got the Hot String Beans with Chicken.\n\nThe Hot String Beans had a good tender chicken and flavorful brown sauce but the string beans were pretty raw and kinda nasty so I pretty much scooped them out from the dish into one of the empty sections of the plate and there was a lot of them.  I actually ate the salad which I normally don't do.  The portion size was pretty good as well but I wish there was less of the green beans and more chicken, but I left feeling quite satisfied and not hungry.\n\nSo I was going to rate this place a solid 4 stars but a couple of things knocked off a star, one of them was the raw string beans I mentioned above and the other was the strange way in which they applied the Scoutmob and manually entered a higher value when I received my receipt.\n\nMy order total came out to being $15.19 which should have been $7.60 but my receipt came back being $8.19; so I didn't bother to ask, just meant they got a lower tip then I was originally gonna leave them.\n\nI may come back another time to give it a shot if they still have the Scoutmob deal going on ;-)", "author": "Arthur Z."}

I was wandering around the Mission looking for Muddy Waters and had a hunch that I was going the wrong way. I stopped in at the cleanest-looking place that was open and found myself in a trendy-looking restaurant staffed by two bored-looking Asian men who looked at me as if I'd wandered in off the street. Which I had. They were very nice, though, and promptly told me that I had to get back onto Valencia, etc.\n\nMy second and third, and first real, experiences with KT were through a Scoutmob coupon. KT got great reviews on Yelp and the coupon was for 50% off so the Husband and I drove down 16th, miraculously found parking nearby and had ourselves a seat. This place was jammin' at around 8:30 p.m. so TIP ALERT it was a good thing we had made an OpenTable reservation. \n\nIt took about 10 minutes for one of the waiters to bring us our menus, another 10 for them to take our order, and about 30 minutes before we got our food. Now normally, I would immediately cut stars right and left for this kind of service but I forgave them because the food was really pretty good and the price was great. We used the Husband's coupon and then went back a few weeks later with my coupon. Between the two times, we ordered:\n\n- Wings: nice and spicy\n- Cream cheese taffies: like fried crab rangoon but lighter \n- Crispy chicken with basil: exactly what it sounds like, great flavor\n- Sweet green curry: standard green curry\n- \"Sriacha\" madness: great kick to it\n- Fried banana with vanilla ice cream: delicious, especially with the honey they give you\n\nCheck it out, especially since the Scoutmob deal lasts through April, I believe.", "author": "Christine P."}

However, we were early and it was a three-day weekend so things were probably a bit slow; many people came in later (~730 or so). Several members of our party were running late but the restaurant staff didn't mind and let us relax for an hour as we ordered appetizers and drinks, not forcing us to order entrees until we were ready. I appreciate not feeling rushed through dinner, which seems unusual these days. Again this may not be the busiest of restaurants but that served us well.\n\nThe food itself was very flavorful and spicy (be sure to take note of the spiciness ratings indicated by \"+\"). We were wimps and opted for \"+\" and \"++\" dishes. Got the crispy egg rolls, cashew nuts platter sauteed, and drunken noodles (my favorite).

I think the problem is that so many of us are jaded in SF for two reasons:\n\n1) Osha Thai ruined it (it's fancy, modern, but the food is just average)\n2) There's an abundance of Thai restaurants to try & compare\n\nAnd yet, Krua Thai stands out from the crowd. The food is better (imho) than Lers Ros Thai, Little Thai (T2J Old Little Thai), and Thai Stick. Possibly more authentic, or with a different spin than Benjarong Thai (also great food AND great ambiance / service). And even though Jitlada may be my new favorite for quality of their food, their ambiance / decor is simple, and what we've all come to expect from a Thai restaurant. So for Krua Thai to have food that's as good or better AND modern decor, honestly my dining companion and I were pleasantly pleased.\n\nWe ordered the Ginger & Scallions Shrimp and the Chicken Pad Thai (I know, I know, not so adventurous, but it was late). The Ginger & Scallions was delicious - very fresh ginger taste, and yummy vegetables. And the Pad Thai was surprisingly not as orangish-yellow as usual, but one of the best tasting dishes I've ever had. They hit it *dead on* in terms of spices, not too oily, but not too dry, and it was superb. (And as we all know, there's plenty of bad tasting Pad Thai in SF.)\n\nI loved the shades of gray walls, the wine display above the bar, the comfy window seat with pillows, the modern hollywood regency style (both the white chairs, as well as the black & silver - a la: http://www.annesage.com/.a/6a00e55225716d883301053633d9ed970b-pi).

We also ordered the crispy basil chicken which was in a pretty tasty sauce.  The best part were the veggies on this dish.  They really captured the basil flavor.  The chicken pieces did not and became soggy very quickly.   \n\nOne friend ordered a shrimp stir fry and the waiter kept taking away the plate she was using to discard the tails. So, we had to keep asking for more plates over and over.  \n\nPretty good wine.

The Groupon deal was $1 for $10 worth of food.\n\nOrdered the $10 lunch special and a drink. I usually just stick to good ol' water, but I felt bad about getting a completely free deal since it was a sit down restaurant, so also ordered a Thai iced tea which was perfectly sweetened. Whenever I order thai tea at other restaurants, I usually have to add almost half a glass of water to make it bearable to drink, but this one was just right.\n\nI settled on  the yellow chicken curry which had pineapple, sweet potato, red bell peppers and peanuts. Lunch specials are served with the house soup, steamed rice , egg rolls and a salad. The salad was basic and would have preferred maybe a peanut dressing, egg rolls were minimally filled with cabbage and carrots, so it was mostly just wrapper. Despite that, the curry made up for the less than stellar accompaniments. Good combination of the creamy coconut milk, heat and sweetness. I usually don't eat white rice, but the sauce was so good I could have easily requested for another bowl of rice, but I didn't. Thank goodness the portions were a little on the small size because there were still several more food stops to go.\n\nI think it was the decor more so than the food that I fell in love with! So clean, modern, simple and elegant. I could see myself hanging out here more often.  I loved the neutral colors; taupe grey walls, with white and black accents. Black leather diamond quilted chairs, bay window seating with pillows, white framed artwork, propeller like ceiling fans and add the homemade touch with a huge glass canister of freshly made red sangria sitting on the counter. Could I just transport this place over to my living room?  \n\nI usually go to Osha to get my Thai food fix, but this was a nice change of pace. Pleasant surprise from the last $1 Groupon lunch deal which took me on a trek to find a burrito place in the Mission, which ended up to be behind some car wash... yeah, pretty ghetto but at least the food was good..

The Tom Yum soup was delicious.  But the Summer Roll was very bland-- mostly just lettuce wrapped in rice paper.  The panaeng curry was pretty good, but relied heavily on coconut milk.  But the biggest disappointment was the hot string beans (from the sauteed menu) with prawns.  The green beans were essentially raw when they served them.  I had to send them back-- something I've not done in years.  When they brought them back out, they were still significantly undercooked.  We ate all the prawns and left the green beans on the plate; I later told the waiter, but they charged us for them anyway.\n\nI've been searching for great Thai food in the eastern half of the city, but sadly my search will have to continue.", "author": "Ritik C."}

The rest of the food came out in a bento box-like arrangement. There were 4 little balls of \"SHUmai\" (their spelling) with a dipping sauce, a \"salad\" comprised of a handful of iceberg + red cabbage with a mayo-like dressing, a half sphere of rice, and maybe a cup's worth of my \"entree\" pick, which was sauteed eggplant with beef. The flavor was pretty good though on the greasy side. The amount of eggplant was generous. This is probably the right amount of food to eat in one sitting, but I really enjoy having leftovers to bring home.

All the rice coagulated together so you couldn't see the shape of any individual rice, it was just a blob of starch. It was delicious, but the texture was really bad. So i was conflicted. The massaman curry was also pretty good, but again, the rice ruined it for me. I would've just cooked my own rice, but I was too hungry. I'm confused as to how a restaurant can mess up cooking rice. I ordered it to be delivered and it took around 1.5 hours (which is pretty long imo). Maybe it was in the car for really long and the condensation from the container made the rice weird?

I assume it fills up more during real dinner time. The first time I was there, I had the mango chicken dish. It was good, but too sweet for me. I love mango, but I've noticed that mango thai dishes tend to be overly sweet for my non sweet tooth, so it's probably my fault and I'll just stop ordering them! :) This last time, I got the drunken noodles with veggies and tofu, which was nice and savory and tasty. Sometimes noodle dishes can be either too small or too large of servings, but this one seemed just right. It wasn't spicy though, even though it had some asterisks next to it. Over the two visits, we tried a couple of appetizers. I don't remember what we got the first time, but this past Saturday, we had a cream cheese sort of thing, which was just ok (my friends really loved it) and some curry samosa type things, which were good. The thai iced tea was tasty too. The first time we went, one of my friends had some noodle dish that looked really good, but I don't know what it was. My other friend had the pineapple rice, which he enjoyed so much, he almost wanted to order again but decided to be different. The last time, my friends both had a fried fish dish, which they enjoyed.  Lots of fish, little bit of salad and plain rice on the side. Overall, we all enjoy Krua, and I'm sure I'll be back. The prices are good too, and it's an easy walk if you've been sunning in the park on a warm day!", "author": "Merredith L."}

The room was clean lines and gray. w/ some b/w photos of the Mission on one wall.   Boring.  I had the \"Sriracha Madness\" w/ tofu.   It came with soup that was lukewarm salty packaged bouillon with shredded veggies.  two inedible fried rolls and some tofu and veggies doused in chili sauce.  I was hoping for something more complex and fresh.  SF doesnt need another formula Thai restaurant.", "author": "Fred b."}

Hesitant to that fact we still decided to go in. The menu seemed a little confusing but my friend and I both got the $10 lunch special. Plenty of food with a pre-soup, salad, appetizer and main course with rice. Taste was fine, not the best thai food I've ever had but I'll probably be back for lunch again.", "author": "Andrew C."}

No wait i think Trader joe's packaged pad thai is better than this thai restaurant's.  Delivery took forever.  The other food is standard...nothing special.", "author": "LT B."}

I asked for a vegan version and they knew exactly what to do so I didn't have to explain anything. The food was really really good. My friend had the fried noodle pad thai and he thought it was good as well. Atmosphere is really nice too, for the price it's so beautiful in there!", "author": "Amanda L."}

On Mondays and Tuesdays they have a buy-one get-one free on wine, which includes sparkling. Naturally, this is what caught my attention and brought me in. The first evening I ate by myself and was happily surprised that their menu seems underpriced. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai ($8) and had my two glasses of sparkling wine, spending under $15 (before tip). The next day I had a date and knew I was going to wind up paying so I came back (knowing they still have their BOGO sale). Two dinner plates and two glasses of sparkling wine: under $40 after tip. That's a cheap date. The place looks pleasantly chic-modern which lends to being overpriced but you'll be happily surprised looking at the menu. The staff was incredibly friendly both times but a star was taken out because the environment feels a little awkward, though I'm not sure why.", "author": "Matthew R."}

Am a fan of their original flavors and attention to culinary detail. Roti dessert a very pleasant surprise. So good to be in a place where staff and chefs so clearly enjoy their work. Beautiful decor and seating, so a comfortable place for friends.", "author": "Geoff W."}

I ordered delivery tonight, after taking my order at 8:45 PM saying they will deliver at 9:45, they call at 9:45 PM saying that they are too busy and won't make my food.  This is of course after just about every other place has already closed :(  This was really unprofessional and unacceptable.  I won't be trying them again.", "author": "Greg D."}

The spring rolls were okay.  A few bites I just tasted mint.  There was not enough peanut sauce and the sauce itself was not thick enough.  Maybe it would have been better to order it with real meat.  I loved the Yellow Tango though.  It was super spicy and at a \"two star\" spiciness, I don't even want to think about how hot a three star spiciness would be.  The portion was generous and I took home most of it.  The bathrooms are really clean, but the lighting is weak.  Service was excellent and the waiters are cute.", "author": "k h."}

Also, their lunch special says that you can get a curry AND a choice from the sauteed menu and when I went there I was told I could pick one.  It's a pet peeve of mine that businesses honor what they advertise or correct it!", "author": "Dawn J."}
