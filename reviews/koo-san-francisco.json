They don't do set menus here (or at least in my experience) so you keep going with courses until you are full. They start off your omakase experience with the spoonful of happiness and it is the best thing ever. It's even paired with sake. During my last visit here I asked for this course twice because it's just that good. \n\nThe chefs are very friendly and interactive. Pricing is decent for omakase.

I stopped in for dinner with a friend one weekday evening and the restaurant filled up quickly. We split the veggie tempura appetizer, which was perfectly crispy and a great start to the meal. We also split a bottle of crisp and refreshing chilled sake. \n\nThis place is known for their starter called Spoonfuls of Happiness, which the gentlemen next to us ordered and explained. We didn't end up getting it, but I definitely would try it next time. It was something really unique that I'd never seen before. I ordered the sashimi combo, with 3 pieces each maguro, hamachi, salmon, and albacore. The combo also comes with miso soup and a house salad or wakame (seaweed salad). The fish seemed very fresh and each piece was perfectly cut. Hamachi and salmon are my favorite - they're so buttery! It was a lot of food for $29 so I was happy. Service was good and we had no complaints there. If I lived in this area I would frequent this place often. I don't think I'd necessarily seek it out or drive a long way to get there, but if you're area and craving sushi give it try.", "author": "Katy C."}

I called last minute for a res with ease and chose to sit at the sushi bar for the omakase.\n\nNigiri and Sashimi Omakase - I went in thinking this would come out to around $70 but it only came out to $56.50! They calculate based off the individual piece of fish they give you. It was very worth given that I had 6 pieces of sashimi in addition to the 10 pieces of nigiri. However, I'm not a fan of their rice nor the way they made the nigiri. All the fishes were decorated with tons of sauce and I felt that overpowered the fish. One thing that stood out in particular was the Hokkaido scallop; it was the sweetest I had ever had! The other courses weren't that memorable nor special though. \n\nHamachi Kama - Don't get this! It was one of the worst ones I've had...super tough and dry :( it wasn't cheap either. \n\nThe chef was kind of awkward and didn't really converse with us at all, but at the end he split the last piece of nigiri into two pieces for us (we shared the omakase) and I thought that was super nice! \n\nThe server gave us the wrong check originally that was almost twice as much as what we had ordered, but they corrected it after. I would say this place is cheap if you just want to try omakase, but given the price you won't get the freshest/best fish. Since it's mediocre fish for the price I'm paying, I'd prefer to go to somewhere that costs more or considerably cheaper.", "author": "Tina P."}

Well, there is also a phrase that says promises don't come easy.   My friends and I made reservations for a Friday and were seating promptly.  This place has air conditioning, so dress comfortably. The waiter came with our drinks pretty quick and we already studied the menu the night before and already know what we were going to order.  We got the omakase,  1 was the nigiri and sashimi omakase, and the other the Koo Omakase.  We did get a few appetizers to start out.  We ordered the Hamachi Carpaccio, the Santa Barbara Uni, Hokkaido Uni and the scallops two way.  \n\nThe Hamachi Carpaccioi was ok, it was cut a little too thick, so it didn't have the melt in your mouth taste. The second thing that came out was the Spinach salad.  You had to mix it well with the sesame dressing, which i liked.  \n\nThe Spoonful of Happiness came out next.  One spoon had the uni with the egg, the other i think was hamachi.  The Uni and the egg spoon was my least favorite.  The egg was a little over powering.  You couldn't really taste the uni that well.  The other spoon had the hamachi and that was better, because you can taste the freshness.  For each spoon, they recommend you take a sip of your sake first before each bite.  I thought the sake was ok, it was a light sake to me, and was a little smooth, not as smooth as i normally like it to be.  \n\nNext came the Santa Barbara and Hokkaido Uni.  Both of the uni's were fresh, but the Hokkaido one, won by a mile.   It was more fresh, like fresh from the sea fresh.  You can also taste the sweetness more compared to the Santa Barbara one.  I don't know what sauce they added to it, but it made it really good. \n\nThe sashimi came out next and i was disappointed with portion of the slices.  They were really small.  The tuna didn't taste that fresh to me, i liked the scallop and the butterfish one more.  The scallop tasted super sweet, which was good. The butterfish did taste more fresh compared to the tuna. \n\nThe Nigiri was ok,   I felt there were two out of the 7 that didn't taste as fresh.  We told the waiter in the beginning , that one of the omakase needs the wasabi omitted, but he forgot.  He also forgot our scallop two way.  We actually asked about the miso soup after our appetizers but he said it comes last.  Miso soup comes out last?  hmm, ok,  maybe it's a new modern.  He did feel bad that he forgot our scallop and the wasabi dish, so he did give us some mochi ice cream.   \n\nOverall, i understand that some people have the off days, but we were the first customers and there wasn't any customers for a while, so i was a little disappointed with the service.  The food was ok to me, i have to say that i like Saru a lot more.  If i wanted Omakase, i would recommend Wako or Saru, sorry Koo, you ain't cool enough for me.", "author": "Belinda C."}

We had reservations and was the first party seated, but we got forgotten about and didn't end up ordering until three other tables had received food first, so that was a little frustrating.\n\nSpoonful of happiness was absolutely delicious! The spoonful with the quail egg/uni was a little too soft for me - texture wise. The spoonful that contained ankimo was my favorite! Fantastic flavors and great texture! Goma Ae-rather plain but something good to get the meal started. Consisted of asparagus and spinach balled up. Sashimi-very fresh and good variety. Miso soup-steaming hot and full of flavor! Delicious :) Nigiri-some really great flavors! I loved the pieces that had ponzu on them. Also very fresh! Added on the Hamachi Carpaccio - not the best I've had, but love ponzu sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-25", "description": "I came here with a group of Yelp Elite friends claiming Koo as one of the best sushi spots in town. We had reservations for 5 and were immediately seated and served hot tea and water.\n\nWe mainly came for the Happy Hour menu which contains a selected number of appetizers, handrolls, and drinks for $5. I went for two handrolls --Salmon and California. Per recommendation, I also got the Spoonfuls of Happiness ($14).\n\nTo start off, we shared the Stuffed Jalapenos ($5 for 4 pieces) and Godzilla Tofu ($5 for 8 pieces). I liked that the jalapenos were stuffed with chopped hamachi and nicely roasted, which was a great starter. As for the tofu, it had good flavor on the outside, but not so much on the inside.\n\nNow comes the star of the show at Koo: Spoonfuls of Happiness. It comes in a shot of chilled sake and two spoonfuls --one with uni and quail egg in ponzu sauce, and another with ankimo (monkfish liver) wrapped with white fish. You start with half the shot of sake followed by the lighter spoon with the uni and quail egg. Then back to the sake to finish the second spoon. This entire dish was quite the presentation and experience in itself. The flavor profiles truly balances the flavors and enhances your tastebuds --so creamy and melt in your mouth! Trust me, you can't come here without trying this.\n\nAs for the handrolls, they were quite standard. I'm not usually a big handroll fan except for Kazunori in LA, so these were decent. The fish was fresh and rice was warm and soft, but the nori was a bit chewy to bite into. It's a good item choice for happy hour though.\n\nOverall, pretty delicious sushi here. The menu is quite reasonable in pricing and I am much more excited to come back and try their omakase. I also appreciated that the waitresses continued refilling our waters and hot tea even after we finished our meal as we continued chatting for another half an hour or so.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

And their Spoonful of Happiness is just that - a definite must-order and one of their specialities.\n\nAs for service, very good.

It would've been our first experience and we chose Koo based on a recommendation from a friend and all the great yelp reviews. \n\nUnfortunately out experience at Koo was truly an awful one. I had emailed to RSVP in advance for omakase at the bar. We were confirmed for Saturday at 8pm. We showed up last night at 8pm and were escorted to a table. We asked the waiter why we couldn't get bar seats after being confirmed for omakase at the bar through email and she said you can do omakase at the table, everything would come out at once instead of one by one. We offered to wait until they were done and she condescendingly stated, those are frequent customers and they will be here until closing. \n\nWe ultimately decided NOT to do omakase because we didn't want both of our first omakase experience to be at a table and not in true omakase fashion - everything would've come out at once instead of one at a time. We put our order in for other food there. By 8:30 (30 minutes later), all the people sitting at the bar left. The waiter had clearly not even asked or even bothered to try and accommodate us. She didn't even offer us the seats after they left. \n\nThis was my first time traveling to California, and my first time in San Francisco. Also this would've been my first time doing omakase. The customer service here was terrible and stands out as the single most disappointing thing that happened during my short weekend in California. Thanks Koo, for being awful.", "author": "Adam N."}

Two spoons of happiness indeed!\n\nHamachi Kama\nI'm not too much a fan of this dish but for what it was, it was good. My boyfriend was head over heels for this dish. It was very flaky and tender. The sauce had the right touch of acidity to balance out the sweetness of the fish.\n\nOysters\nThis was meh for me also. I am a big fan of oysters but there was a lack of oyster in this. The sauces over powered the over all texture and taste of the oyster and the oyster meat was relatively small.\n\nUni spoon\nUni(you need) one spoon and you just fall in love.

Once there at the sushi bar, I got to interact with Chef Wayne while he presented the many distinctive nigiri of his choosing!  The talking with the Chef helped with what one was in the mood for.  \n\nTheir signature Spoonfuls of Happiness was the highlight as an opener, surely! It was served up with sake as well!  The delicacy of uni, quail egg, ponzu sauce, ankimo with whitefish and amazing truffle oil, was to savor over!\n\nOnce we were warmed up with some hot sake shots, Chef Wayne was quite a softie.  He tossed in a few tidbits, based on our conversation with him.  I got to understand the difference in texture on scallop that has been sitting in water compared to fresh scallop that hasn't been in water for the longest time. The texture was more thorough or shall I say meaty instead of soft, it's thinner in comparison and tinted in darker shade of color.\n\nThe seared Wagyu and Hokkaido uni nigiri stood out as specialities. \n\nMost of all, when we asked Chef Wayne to make us something that truly came from him as a form of expression to his craft, he served up what I deemed the Chef's Heart.\n\nMy ultimate favorite was just that.

We had a reservation for 8:15, but had to wait half an hour before we got seated. By this time, it was 8:45 and our late dinner was made even later...\n\nWe ordered the agedashi tofu, omakase #2, and green tea tempura ice cream. The tofu was covered and deep fried with mochi, which was delightfully crisp and chewy at the same time. \n\nThe omakase came with two sashimi dishes and 10 pieces of nigiri. We eventually realized how much food this was, because we were beginning to feel full even before we had the main dish! It was amazing that the omakase was only $60 for such high quality fish. The omakase had a great diversity of fish and flavors, for a great price.\n\nLastly, we ended our meal with tempura ice cream ($4)! It was a single scoop, but just enough for me and my boyfriend to add a sweet treat to our already full bellies. \n\nOverall, a very good meal in a restaurant with a quiet, romantic ambiance. However, -1 star for the wait on top of our reservation..", "author": "Christine L."}

We were served by Chef Mike, a super friendly guy that really took good care of us that evening.  We ordered the Nigiri and Sashimi Omakase, and we added an order of shrimp nigiri and  a spicy tuna roll. The quality of the fishes and it's variety were jaw dropping. Chef Mike served us with a bowl of miso soup first, followed by a plate of mixed sashimi, then 10 Nigiri, piece by piece.  Chef Mike explained each nigiri by the type of fish and it's origin. We enjoyed the dinner and the conversation with Chef Mike, he is definitively a fun guy to talk to, and he made the evening for entertaining.

All the other $$$$ sushi places in the city were packed but luckily they were able to seat me right away here. I got the $65 Omakase (there's 3 options for the omakase between $50-$65) and an ika shiso maki roll. Parking in the area was pretty easy. It was street parking only but luckily there's plenty around (at least on a Sunday night). Service was also very attentive. The guy who served me was new so there was a bit of confusion with my order but it was sorted out. He was also very nice when I asked him for the list of the fish served in my nigiri course since I never heard of one of the fish before so he wrote out the entire thing. A+ for that!\n\nOnto the food!\n0) Ika shiso maki roll: Not part of the omakase but I knew I needed a little extra something to feel full and this was perfect. The ika was a bit tough and it could've used more shiso. Otherwise it was a good combo. Nothing amazing but a good extra something to fill me up (3.5/5)\n\n1) Appetizer: Cucumber w/ Kinmedai: I love golden eye snapper so much and this was a great way to eat it. I would've liked a bit more acidity in the cucumber because the kinmedai had a rich char taste that could've used some acid. Also to be nit picky the cucumber slices were not very uniform. Not a huge deal since this was only a $65 omakase but Yelp is basically my food diary so I'm throwing that in. (3.5/5)\n2)Sashimi Course: 2 Slices of maguro, 2 pieces of kampachi, 1 piece of hotate (cut into 2 halves): There wasn't much presentation in this dish but the quality speaks for itself. The maguro was delicious and I don't say that easily. It was meaty, clean, and light all at the same time. Kampachi was also decently fresh. It had some flavor and a good meaty bite as well. The hotate was the only disappointing piece. It didn't have as much flavor and wasn't very tender. (4/5)\n3) Miso Soup: Nothing particularly noteworthy. Not a great bowl but not bad.\n4) Nigiri Course: Included Isaki (Threeline Gruntfish), Kasugotai (Baby Spring Sea Bream), Umimasu (Ocean Trout), Kurodai (Black Sea Bass),  Shima Aji (Striped Jack), Toro (Blue Fin Belly), and Japanese Uni. This was a great selection of fish that transitioned very well from one piece to the next. I had never had the Isaki before and honestly it was a my least favorite but it was a good piece to start with since it was very light and firm. The kasugotai still retains the taste of sea bream but with a more tender bite. I could've used a bit more of the added ingredient but it had a sweet sour kick that was nice. The Shima Aji also had a tasty garlic ponzu? on it that I really liked. Toro was fatty and soft. Honestly better than some otoro which can be a bit much. The uni was absolutely amazing. It's been a while since I've had good Uni but this was superb. It wasn't sweet but it was pillowy and buttery. Everything else wasn't particularly special but it was all delicious. Rice wasn't too strongly flavored but had just enough to pair well with all the neta. It had a good bite to it and the nigiri itself was formed well. (4/5)\n4) Spoon of Happiness: Spoon 1 is kampachi wrapped around monkfish w/ ponzu. Spoon 2 is uni w/ tobiko and uzura. They are served w/ a shot of sake for a palette cleanser. I had the kampachi first. Since the kampachi isn't very strong it went well w/ the monkfish that seemed to have a very strong smokey flavor. It almost tasted like bacon. The two together were still a bit salty but the sake helped out. The second spoon was also delicious but honestly I can't say I liked it more than just uni w/ rice & wasabi but honestly you can't go wrong w/ the uni/tobiko/uzura combination.\n\nOverall my experience here was fantastic. It was a bit awkward to dine alone here but at least I got some great food out of it!", "author": "Vivian C."}

But then just when i should be asleep and about 10 mins after my husband I start feeling upset stomach followed by clear symptoms of food poisoning. This is about 6 hours after we ate at Koo.

After all, I feel that the food in the sunset and richmond area is way better and less pricey. We felt like getting sushi and Koo was recommended on several websites. So, from GG Park, we walked over. \nFull disclosure here, we got here exactly when it opened (5:30 PM?) so our service was quite prompt (5 star service here!). We were the only people for like 5-10 minutes so the waitress gave us all her attention and described a lot of the dishes/fish of the day for us. \nWe got TWO spoons of happiness because its so good, you shouldn't share. AT ALL. They're beginners and comes with a shot of sake that you can drink between each spoon to clear the flavor. Best deal-$15 for some amazing uni and fish PLUS a shot of sake that would probably be like $5/shot at any other japanese restaurant. R loved it. And then, after we finished the spoons, our entire order came out. Nicely timed. We got some salmon, toro, hamachi, and a few other fishes. SO GOOD. Although R said next time we come, we should just order 3 of the toro and the salmon.

Like everyone said, the spoonful of happiness is absolutely amazing. The great thing about this omekase is that the chef really tries to combine different tastes -- for example, a sprinkle of lemon peel, or a dash of green onion -- to create mouth-watering concoctions. Other omekases I've had were just...some raw fish on a bite of rice. The omekase at Koo actually felt personal. And the chef was really great at making things for us that weren't on the menu after asking what types of fish/seafood we liked.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have the memory to tell you what exactly I had, but everything was delectable.", "author": "Jennifer J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-08", "description": "This used to be our favorite neighborhood sushi place - after moving out of the neighborhood, we would even come back to dine here. Today, I took an out-of-state colleague of mine here to impress her with good quality sushi, but unfortunately this place is not what it used to be. I used to live in Japan for 10 years and have experienced a lot of sushi places (including Sukiyabashi Jiro), and have tried a lot here in the US. I think they are under new management and the staff is certainly new (I remember the old staff used to speak Japanese). The sushi we ordered was still okay, but my problem is with the service and the lack of understanding of what and how they are serving. We were asking for umeshu (plum liqueur) and first, the chef at the counter did not understand what I was asking. When I switched from ordering in Japanese to English, he still gave me the look. Then he told me the server takes the drink orders (he could have just let our server know - the place was not busy at all). Then the server said they don't have such drink. I could not believe, so we opened the menu, and there it was - umeshu or plum liqueur.\nWhile the place was almost empty (this place used to be always full), the counter was full (six seats), and the three chefs serving the guests started to drink beer. This would be no problem in a bar for sure, but quite unusual in a sushi place. Then, when I asked for a pinch of salt for the tempura we ordered, the chef gave me the surprised look again, like I was ordering something that does not match with tempura. In Japan, it's common practice to either serve salt with the tempura, or certainly provide it upon request. \nThen the chef dropped another client's order slip and a pen on my wooden plate (that holds the sushi). It happens, no problem. However, he did not even bother to apologize, then after laughing and picking it up he did not change nor offer me a new plate.\nPerhaps he was a bit drunk - after all, they were having a party there with the other chefs.\nBut the most surprising thing was that when our chef rolled the sushi, he put a plastic food wrap between the sushi and the bamboo rice paddle and then left the plastic wrap on the roll when cutting the roll up. It does not seem to be a big deal, but it is like having a table cloth in a restaurant covered up with a piece of paper so they don't have to change the table cloth after each guest. The bamboo rice paddle can be / should be washed after rolling a messier roll. They certainly use the plastic wrap so that they don't have to bother washing it / cleaning it / wiping it each time. Also, small pieces of the plastic wrap could end up in the roll. Also, I have never seen this in Japan.\nI am sorry to be so picky, but sushi making is certainly ALL about the details. And it is ALL about service when you are sitting at the counter, watching the chefs working. And this place is slipping... If this was a $ place, with half the prices, I would overlook such details. While this place is certainly not high end, the prices they charge would command for better focus on details.\nFood quality: 3.5/5\nPreparation technique: 2/5\nService: 2/5\nValue for the price: 3/5", "author": "G N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-28", "description": "I suggest trying out Koo only if you have some appreciation of izakaya style cuisine. I came here a few years ago and it was na\u00efve and cynical because I was frustrated at all small portions, overpricedness, and general fuss and frills of fine dining--3 stars. Then I came back for happy hour after living in SF for a few years and becoming accustomed to/spoiled by all the good food so I was finally able to pick up on some of the subtleties instead of complaining about paying so much and still being hungry--4 stars. Maybe one day I will be a professional diner and be able to taste things at Koo that normal people can't detect, and I will give 5 stars.\n\n[THE SIGNATURE]\n\nA Spoonful of Happiness (a spoonful of uni, quail egg, tobiko ponzu & a spoonful of ankimo wrapped with whitefish, white truffle-oil ponzu & a shot of chilled sake):This is the highlight of many reviews and after seeing all the pretty photos you feel inclined to order it because it looks so photogenic. I'm not even a fan of sea urchin or monkfish liver or truffle oil (too fancy for me) and $13 is expensive but includes alcohol. So I decided to be adventurous and deviated from my friends' orders. The conversation went like this: \n\nFriends order appetizers and drinks.\nMe: Can I get the Spoonful of Happiness?\nServer: Just one order?\nMe: Yes, I'll be happy by myself...!\n\nAlthough my palate is not culinarily cultured to all these exotic ingredients (raw quail egg made me squirm a little), I did enjoy the unique flavors and complex layers. The sake definitely made it tastier; if a spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down, a shotful of sake makes the spoonfuls go down. It's among the craftiest things I've ever eaten--spoonfuls of happiness indeed. (And, of course, I maximized my $13 by essentially taking multiple 360-degree panoramic shots of my spoons)\n\n[THE HAPPY HOUR]\n\nGodzilla Tofu (crispy tofu with spicy garlic miso): Surprisingly tasty for tofu! The crispy exterior is nicely balanced by a soft silky interior. While I liked the simplicity, I think it could be even better with a ponzu dipping sauce of sorts.\n\nStuffed Jalapeno (with hamachi, with lime aioli): Before you get scared by the jalapeno pepper, let me tell you this is not spicy at all (nor is most Japanese food). Decent appetizer especially if you like strong, bold flavors.\n\n[THE KITCHEN]\n\nMiso Marinated Black Cod (served with dashi branched baby bok choy and fried tofu): Pricey, but the cod melts in your mouth! \n\nFlying Kamikaze (spicy tuna and asparagus wrapped with albacore and topped with garlic ponzu and scallions): For once, gimmicky toppings are a nice addition to the sushi roll and not just used to mask funky fish--the sashimi quality is good, and overall it's tasty (this is one of their more popular rolls).\n\n[THE VERDICT]\n\nI browsed around their website and read up on the chef and the restaurant name: Koo is a masculine, informal way of saying eat (I guess it's somewhat the Japanese equivalent of omnomnom except less cutesy). In my opinion it's quite the opposite because it's dainty and the portions are too small to be something that guys would be happy with. \n\nKoo is a level up from the rest of the Inner Sunset in terms of food and ambiance fanciness, but the price is also leveled up accordingly. Worth a try if you think spoonfuls and happiness and the like will make you happy!", "author": "Edna C."}

Their rolls are insanely fresh and the quality of the fish is wonderful. \n\nKoo has been serving authentic sushi in the Inner Sunset since 2004 and you can taste it in their entire menu. Some of their most popular and acclaimed dishes are their Spoonful of Happiness, their Salmon and Tuna Tartar, their Miso Black Cod, and their Azteca Roll.  If you still have room for dessert - their Mt Fuji - a freshly made chocolate cake stuffed with chocolate mousse and paired with either ginger or green tea gelato is a worthwhile indulgent treat.\n\nMy usual delivery order here is the California Roll and the Dragon Roll. Normally I steer clear of California Rolls - since it's often imitation crab - but not at Koo. Their crab is real and absolutely divine. Their Dragon Roll is plump with lightly battered tempura shrimp and I appreciate that it's topped with heavy handed portions of eel. Swoon.\n\nIf you're looking for a fantastic dinner - come to Koo. It's truly an Inner Sunset neighborhood gem. Or better yet - do like me - rinse off the day's grime from your face, throw on something comfortable, put on some sweet tunes, and then let it come to you.\n\nTrust.", "author": "Jessica T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-19", "description": "Koo = one of the best sushi experiences I've had in the States (and that's saying a lot).\n\nIf you've heard of Koo, then you've undoubtedly heard of the restaurant's \"Spoonful of Happiness.\"  If you haven't, then let me explain.  The Spoonful of Happiness ($12) consists of:\n\n- One spoonful of uni (sea urchin), quail egg, tobiko (flying fish roe), and ponzu sauce\n- One spoonful of ankimo (monk fish liver) wrapped in whitefish with white truffle oil and ponzu sauce\n- One shot of chilled sake\nPhoto: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/koo-san-francisco?select=nUvNLeb85G0xCLRrGZ0umw#nUvNLeb85G0xCLRrGZ0umw\n\nSo yes, it's technically two spoonfuls of happiness plus a shot of sake, but the restaurant brands the concoction as the Spoonful of Happiness.  Heck, they even have Spoonful of Happiness t-shirts you can buy.  Is it worth it?  Yes.  Our table enjoyed the Spoonful of Happiness so much we ordered two sets for each of us: one to begin our meal and one to end our meal.  It was that good.\n\nKoo is a small Japanese restaurant tucked away in Inner Sunset.  Sit at the sushi bar if you want to see the chefs work their magic or sit in the dining area.  Either way, the food is spectacular.  Koo is headed by chef-owner Kiyoshi Hayakawa.  I'm from Atlanta where the best sushi restaurant is Sushi House Hayakawa (chef-owner: Art Hayakawa).  This leads me to believe that in Japan, the Hayakawa clan has produced a long line of outstanding sushi chefs.\n\nWhile Westerners tend to enjoy rolls, I'd forgo them and go with a more traditional and purist approach: nigiri.  The regular menu is very nice -- it contains the Spoonful of Happiness after all -- but the Catch of the Day menu is where it's at.  It has the freshest and most unique nigiri selections with almost 20 different kinds to choose from.  These are separate from the regular nigiri (15+) menu.  Here's what we tried, nigiri-wise:\n\nUni - sea urchin\nHirame - halibut, with shiso leaf and ponzu\nKamasu - barracuda\nWild tombo - wild albacore tuna\nKanpachi - amber jack\nWild hamachi - wild yellowtail\nOh-Toro (or \"otoro\") - blue fin tuna, very fat belly\nKasugo Tai - spring baby sea bream\nBlue shrimp\n\nExpect to spend anywhere from $4-9 for every two pieces of nigiri.  Otoro is the exception.  It's the fattiest, most expensive cut of the tuna belly.  One order of otoro nigiri will set you back $16.  Expensive?  Yes.  Overpriced?  No.  Order it.  You won't be disappointed.\n\nI was happy to try some fish I've never had at a sushi restaurant before, including the kamasu and tombo.  Over half of the Catch of the Day menu is sourced from Japan.  Other fish come from places like Hawaii (tombo), Spain (otoro), and New Caledonia (blue shrimp).\n\nIf you like sushi, especially nigiri, you'll be in heaven.  Every piece of fish, seafood, and other ingredients are extremely fresh.  It's noticeable in each piece in terms of taste, texture, and quality.  Most of the sushi is soft, delicate, and buttery.  They simply melt in your mouth.  After 1,200+ reviews, I rarely, if ever, have used the word \"orgasm\" to describe food.  I think the Spoonful of Happiness and the nigiri at Koo are worthy of that.\n\nIf you visit the restaurant before 7:00pm, you can take advantage of their Happy Hour menu.  You can find good deals on hand rolls, appetizers, and alcoholic beverages (Japanese beer, sake, etc.).  We also took advantage of some of these Happy Hour deals and tried the following:\n\nWakame salad - seaweed salad\nHamachi and avocado hand roll\nSpicy tuna hand roll\nMarinated artichoke with shichimi soy mayo\n\nHappy Hour food menu items are only $4-5 per, so take note.  Great stuff all-around.  As with the seafood, the seaweed salad and artichoke were fresh and savory.  The hand rolls, fish, rice, and other ingredients wrapped in seaweed, were simple, nicely executed, and beautifully presented (as were the other items).  If you're wondering what shichimi is, it's seven-flavor chili pepper.  I love putting it in my ramen, so I was pleasantly surprised to see it used with the artichoke here.  The artichoke was grilled.\n\nI didn't even get into the restaurant's salads (e.g. grilled baby octopus salad), other grilled items (e.g. eggplant dengaku), and multitude of shareable plates (e.g. tartare, tataki, tempura).  The sushi is just too good to pass up.\n\nKeiko was our server and she did a marvelous job.  Service was on par with the food.  Polite, attentive, and informative.  Hayakawa-san's wife also works at the restaurant is very friendly.  Cognizant of my enthusiasm of his work, she offered to introduce me to and take a photo with him.  Awesome.\n\nIn summary, Koo offers some of the best sushi not only in the Bay Area, but in the country.  Enjoy!", "author": "Daniel B."}

The fish was super buttery and savory.\n\nAzteca Roll - shrimp tempura, white fish, sliced jalape\u00f1o, tobiko, and green onions. Unique roll because of the jalape\u00f1o, which wasn't too spicy.

All of the nigiri we ordered were super fresh, and there was one that especially melted in your mouth -- I think it was the toro tuna?

I was a little afraid of the garlic and asparagus in the Kamikaze, but all the flavors went really well together, and it also didn't feel like you were eating a veggie roll (nothing against them, but when I eat sushi, I'm there for the fish!). I think the Azteca was my favorite of the 3, and the jalapeno wasn't too spicy at all.\n\nBut of course, the highlight of the night for me was the spoonful of happiness, described on the menu as \"a spoonful of uni, quail egg, tobiko ponzu & a spoonful of ankimo wrapped with whitefish, white truffle-oil ponzu & a shot of chilled sake\".

Seems like \"uni plus quail egg plus sauce\" is a thing now.  I don't know Koo is a leader or follower here, but their execution is awesome... possibly because they also include monkfish liver wrapped in whitefish, and, wonderfully, a shot of sake.  Their very precise directions were: \n1) Sip sake\n2) Shoot quail egg and uni spoon\n3) Sip more sake\n4) Shoot monkfish liver and whitefish spoon  (yes it's actually TWO spoonfuls of happiness)\n5) Finish sake.\n\nI would like to do that again, like right now.  Especially the first spoon which was the best ever.  Unfortunately, I'm using WiFu on a laptop in a cafe that doesn't serve anything made outside Venezuela.\n\nAnyway, Koo also has wonderful nigiri including some beautiful toro AND \"Sanma\" which I had previously had only in Tokyo and, curiously, at Dash in San Mateo.  The server said it means \"Saury Pike\" in English but it really means DELICIOUS SAVORY MAGIC FISH.  Too bad it's so hard to find.  I also tried the Hige Tara and Kamasu (barracuda) which were decent but paled compared with the Sanma and Toro.  \n\nOn a third visit, had other nigiri: the iwana (artic char, salmon's sustainable cousin - delicious here), and shima aji (which was like hamachi... but a little firmer texture and a little less flavor).\n\nMiso black cod has become a staple as Japanese fusion places but I didn't love it here.  What I did love, however, was the mochi covered ice cream balls for dessert... especially the mango one.\n\nFor rolls, the Kamikaze and Azteca are both famous and really good.", "author": "Aaron M."}

It was one of the Tuesday nights where I had such a long day at work, I wanted to go out and have a nice drink with my meal.  The plan was to have omakase at Ichi Sushi but because of the newly finished remodel, the place has been pre-reserved for the past few weeks.  I saw the reviews for Koo  via Yelp in the past and decided to finally it out.\n\nWhile on the way, the boys mentioned that they both had heavy lunches and that they didn't plan on eating much.  They agreed on following my lead with ordering Omakase but cutting after the 2nd or 3rd sushi/dish.  With that said, I of course, offered to pay with the idea that the bill would be around $100.\n\nOmakase, why haven't I learned my lesson yet?  Koo is absolutely delicious and by far has blew me out of the water.  I didn't expect the sushi chef to be so innovative and variety of fish that night was out of this world.  \n\nSeveral orders that stood out that night:\n\nThe Char, we all asked for a second round.  One of the freshest chars that I have ever tasted.\n\nA Spoonful of Happiness  (a spoonful of uni, quail egg, tobiko ponzu & a spoonful of ankimo wrapped with whitefish, white truffle-oil ponzu & a shot of chilled sake)  You cannot leave this place without trying it.  We were told that it was their staple dish.\n\n\n...2 bottles of saki later (between only the 2 of us) and countless rounds of fish specials,  we get our bill of $350.  The boys ended up stopping when I stopped.  I came there with an empty stomach and with the alcohol, I was in a mission to continue my tasting until I was fully satisfied.  Plus, the sushi chefs were very engaging and it was hard not to say no to them. The staff here are so personable and very attentive in refilling your drinks and taking your plates, something pretty rare.\n\nWill I come back?

It's great sitting at the bar and watching him swiftly cut the fishes and make sushi for us. Overall the food is 3 star. Fishes are fresh and of high quality. Rice is ok and a bit too dry and loose, or simply put, a little plain. \n\nMonk fish liver is ok, I had better ones at other sushi restaurants. But the addition of shiso makes me not to the degree of disliking it--without the shiso It would be 2/5 quality--I know I am biased here coz I like shiso.\n\nHamachi toro is my favorite. Very fresh!\n\nAnago is good though its slightly a bit too sweet. \n\nHokkaido scallop is pretty fresh.\n\nHokkaido Uni melts nicely in mouth. Seaweed could be a bit more crispy. Although I am not blown away with wow...I am satisfied.\n\nGoma is, well, just ok. My least favorite.\n\nI had total of 17 sushi. All the others are ok. Overall a good experience. 3.4 out of 5 stars.\n\nSake was generously served.\n\nI did not realize that the omakase they have here is different from Wako or Kusakabe or Yoshizumi--whose onakase is a fixed courses of 16 or so with a la carte (extra after the fixed course) On the menu it says 50 dollars and up--that means after five or six courses, they will just kept feeding you until they noticed you are full and asked: you want more?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-31", "description": "STILL MY FAVORITE SUSHI RESTAURANT IN SF!\n\nAfter nearly two and a half years of trying to avoid Koo, I'm FINALLY back! You see, Koo brings back memories I rather not remember. For a year and a half, my ex and I use to go to Koo almost every Friday for dinner because we were boring creatures of habit. Though we tried other sushi restaurants, the quality of Koo's fish had us coming back time and time again. And, well after the breakup, I refused to go back. But I missed those Spoonfuls of Happiness so darn much that I couldn't resist anymore. \n\nYesterday, 8.30.11, my friends and I came to Koo for dinner at 6:30 PM with reservations. Just to note, Koo can be stringent about reservations so I highly recommend making them. The sushi bar is mainly reserved for Omakase (Chef's Tasting Menu) and you will not be seated there without having reservations. There's a $10 minimum charge per a person. I also suggest not coming here after \"happy hour\" like we did last night because we ended up spending $92/person. *sigh*\n\nAfter dining here over 40 times, I've tried just about everything on the menu but I recommend sticking with the sashimi and sushi. The Chef/Owner use to part of the highly acclaimed Sushi Ran team so you know everything is top-notch! The sashimi is always extremely fresh and there are varieties from overseas that you won't be able to find at other sushi restaurants. Also, all their rolls are flawlessly made and extremely clean which is perfect for sushi purists. \n\nFOOD RECOMMENDATIONS\n(Note: There's Happy Hour Specials Sunday - Thursday from 5 PM-7 PM with $4 handrolls and $5 appetizers. However, it's only about $1 off which isn't really worth it.) \n\n*SPOONFULS OF HAPPINESS - A spoonful of uni, quail egg, tobiko ponzu & a spoonful of ankimo wrapped with whitefish, white truffle-oil ponzu & a shot of chilled sake ($11) \nORGASMIC! The uni is silky smooth with a creamy decadence from the quail egg. Like foie gras of the sea, the akimo was luxuriously buttery especially when paired with the soft whitefish sashimi. A MUST GET!\n\n*SALMON & TUNA TARTAR - Served with spicy guacamole and shrimp chips ($14)\nSmall soft tender chunks of silky salmon and tuna layered with buttery guacamole makes for a deliciously savory combo with a kick. The shrimp chips are thicker than your typical bagged shrimp chips and have a hearty crunch which is a nice texture contrast to the soft tartar. \n\n*U2 ROLL - Tempura shrimp, avocado topped w/spicy tuna & tobiko ($13)\nWarm crunchy shrimp tempura with buttery avocado with a spicy soft tenderness from the spicy tuna. A sure taste bud tickler!\n\n*BEST ROLL - Tempura asparagus, avocado, wrapped in fresh salmon & lemon thin slice ($9)\nAl-dente, crisp tempura asparagus with buttery fresh salmon with a lemon slice make for a rich yet refreshingly light roll.\n\n*FLYING KAMIKAZE - Spicy tuna and asparagus wrapped w/albacore and topped with garlic ponzu and scallions ($13.50)\nThe spicy tuna is softened by the mild albacore and the garlic ponzu gives it a tangy garlicky kick. \n\nSERVICE\nDepending on who's working that night, service can sometimes be spotty and unfortunately curt which was the case last night. However, the owner's wife who's normally there on weekends is very sweet and accommodating. Nonetheless, the food is always consistently good so I plan to become a regular again. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR\nVery clean and zen like but very dark. It's good for small parties no more than 4 people. \n\nPARKING\nEasy street parking before 6 PM. \n\nKoo and I finally reunited again and it FEELS SO GOOD....", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I had to wait all of 15 seconds to get seated so the dining experience started off a great note, and never missed a beat. \n\nI ordered predominately nigiri and maki, but also a couple of appetizers.. The variety and quality of the fish is amazingly delicious and fresh. As other have mentioned the Spoonful of Happiness is quite amazing. First spoon has uni and a quail egg, and the second has ankimo wrapped with white fish, all this accompanied with a shot of sake. Highly recommended!\n\nFor sushi, I had: Maguro, O-Toro, Wild Hamachi, Hamachi Toro, Kasugo, Kinme Dai, Tamago, and Aji. All the fish were fresh with excellent flavor. Expensive, but definitely worth it. The Kinme Dai and Kasugo were from Japan. I'm not always a fan of snapper since it can sometimes be chewy... but both of these specimens were very soft and tender, with a nice mild flavor. The Kasugo was the best surprise.. the skin had a nice texture\n\nFor maki, I had a Negi hamachi and salmon avocado roll. The negi hamachi had a very light and tender consistency and went well with the amount of green onions. I usually expect more green onions, but this combo hit the spot!\n\nI'm not a big fan of salmon of avocado rolls, this one seemed ok, but noting to write home about.\n\nThe Gomae Ae was deconstructed, and had a thicker sesame paste. Not quite what I was expecting and I can't recommend it. The Eggplant was ok.. Sauce was thicker as well.\n\nOverall one of the better places I've been to lately.. Great ambiance helpful staff...", "author": "James S."}

Better late than never, am I right? \n\nMy boyfriend brought me here three weeks ago for my birthday. When I checked Yelp, the ambience said \"casual\" but my boy wanted us to look good for our date so good we looked ( he looked spiffy spiffy...just the way I like c: ). When we arrived, I noticed that even though most customers were dressed casually, the atmosphere still felt intimate, fancy, and romantic due to the dim lighting.\n\nMy boy ordered the following for us:\n\n- Tuna and Salmon Tartar: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wL-rbTpV95GI7Y5iiPjXig&userid=VNXuiSVAOdpm5n5gKqs5xw) SO GOOD. Oh my gosh. It is the perfect appetizer. It came with six big circular shrimp chips and spicy guacamole. It was super refreshing and the pieces of fish were fresh. I didn't know guacamole went so well with sashimi...but then again, guacamole goes well with anything. Hehe\n\n- Spoonful of Happiness: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Jbun8pVKY1oaNHUdHE0dIQ&userid=VNXuiSVAOdpm5n5gKqs5xw) Goodness gracious....as delicious as everything was that night, this selection was definitely the highlight. One order comes with two spoons: the first one has uni, quail egg, and tobiko ponzu, the second one has ankimo (monkfish liver), whitefish, and white truffle oil ponzu. These two spoons also come with a shot of cold sake. We each got an order and oh gosh...no regrets. This dish is a must-get, must-try, must-eat!!\n\n- Toro nigiri & hamachi toro nigiri: Both were yummy. Fresh fish :3 \n\n- Chef's selection sashimi plate: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vNM_qMBwfUy2dGzIueD0QQ&userid=VNXuiSVAOdpm5n5gKqs5xw) Orgasm in my mouth.\n\n- Spider roll: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gFCTkQ595FeAUTdHA3IZiA&userid=VNXuiSVAOdpm5n5gKqs5xw) Didn't make too much of an impression compared to the other dishes. It was good but you can get the same quality of the spider roll at other sushi restaurants. \n\n- Mt. Fuji: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=oR7biTa1zflTy9nXX3TBAQ&userid=VNXuiSVAOdpm5n5gKqs5xw) Chocolate cake stuffed with white chocolate mousse with a side of green tea ice cream. I wasn't expecting anything but when the boy made reservations, he told them it was my birthday so the chocolate cake came with a birthday candle ^^ The dessert was yummy; smooth and creamy, not too sweet, and it went perfectly with the green tea ice cream.\n\nEvery time I reminisce about this night, I want to go back right away. Japanese is my favorite cuisine so I've tried a million sushi restaurants, but Koo is one of the top places on my list. It is pricey so it's not a restaurant to go on the daily.

The seaweed came apart on several pieces (sloppily made), and the rice just wasn't great...any good sushi begins with perfectly made sushi rice!

We got the king crab hand rolls, which tasted great and had a thicker rice than I'm used to (but good tasting), but they went light on the crab in my opinion. We also each got the spicey tuna, hamachi, and maguro hand rolls. All these tasted great, fresh, with a generous amount of fish. I will be back to Koo soon. \n\nPS.

The combo was supposed to be 12 pieces total with three pieces each of tuna, salmon, albacore, and yellowtail. However, mine came with extra salmon, like five or six pieces total (I forgot exactly how many). I considered that a bonus.\n\nOverall pretty good. The albacore was definitely \"meh\" (but then it's not my favorite, except for one Chinese-owned place which I think serves great ones). The tuna and yellowtail was good, but the salmon was quite good and fresh, similar to my favorite place for it (same place alluded to earlier). Afterwards, I ordered the mackerel sashimi which was quite good, with a bit of \"fattiness\" that I notice which especially made it good (and it's in a way that I don't think I noticed much elsewhere).\n\nGood and friendly service too.

We ordered 12 nigiri, shrimp dumplings and the garlic tofu. The garlic tofu was tasty but the sushi was lacking. The rice used for the nigiri was dense and underdone and the fish was mostly just okay. The Uni and Pike were good, the Saba was disappointing and everything else fell somewhere in between. Also, the nigiri took a significant amount of time to make it to the table. \n\nBased strictly on the people and ambiance I would really like to recommend Koo, the sushi is fine and the tofu was great but if you want high-quality, tasty nigiri, I would look elsewhere. \n\nTLDR: Ambiance is romantic, service fantastic, sushi is just okay", "author": "Sara A."}

A green witch noticed that we'd been waiting and offered seats at the sushi bar. We accepted, sat, and were brought menus immediately. The three Asian men dressed up as sushi chefs were delightful and truly talented at their craft. (Har har.)\n\nWe ordered:\n+Sushi combo with fresh wasabi: three pieces each of maguro (tuna), hamachi (amberjack), saki (salmon), and white fish. Delicious and fresh. The wasabi is the real deal, so use with caution.\n+Best roll: tempura asparagus and avocado wrapped in fresh salmon with a thin lemon slice. Refreshing and very tasty.\n+Tokyo crunch roll: spicy tenkasu (crunchy tempura flakes), hamachi, unagi (eel) with cucumber and wasabi tobiko. A bit of a mess to eat, but pretty good.\n+Tempura shrimp roll: with avocado, cucumber, and asparagus. The usual tempura shrimp roll minus the accompanying glob of mayonnaise (thank Jah!)\n\nSpeaking of Jah, our sushi chef noticed my date had dreadlocks and to coerce a smile, he grabbed his \"Halloween costume\": a Rasta cap (complete with the Jamaican flag-colored cap and added dreads) and gave us his best Jamaican accent.

My preference is to sit at the sushi bar and have the sushi chef simply use this instead for my sushi (I like it traditional style on the inside and typically don't season after the chef).\n\nThe Spoonful of Happiness is exactly what it claims to be.  I typically stick with plain nigiri or sashimi, but the chef said on my second visit I needed to try it.  He was right.\n\nThey have a great selection of fish, some local and some deep-sea Japanese ones too, their daily catch has yet to disappoint.  And the quality is excellent, very fresh, good sized pieces, and the right amount of rice.\n\nWhile there I also tried Yebisu, a rice beer.  This was a bit flat and dry, but I mean flat in a good way.  If you have ever tried Boddingtons, you'll understand.  It's not as flat as that, but it's reminiscent.\n\nThe service was also very good, my water and hot tea were never empty, the chef was very prompt with my orders, and they called me a cab at the end of each evening.\n\nIf you love sushi and want a great experience in SF, go to Koo.", "author": "Mark G."}

I felt a little bit misguided by Yelp at first because when I arrived here, it looked very little like the picturesque first view on Yelp but I settled in anyway and figured this many people can't be wrong.\n\nI suppose I was expecting it to be a little nicer, or a little shabbier because usually really great sushi places are either fancy or really hole in the wall. This place was sort of an inbetween. The crowd definitely threw me off as well since most of the very excellent sushi spots I've been to you seldom see folks of non-Asian descent. (I hope this doesn't offend anyone :) it's just an observation). I had similar negative feelings as nobu k. had mentioned due to the decor as well.\n\nEither way, I was wrong on so many accounts on this place because it was absolutely delicious! Before I walked in, I told the bf I was so hungry I wanted to order everything on the menu. I actually did! The spoonful of happiness was definitely well worth it, even at $11 bucks a serving because they were well made and the flavors coordinated with one another very well. \n\nWe ordered all of their fresh catches of the day and snuck in a few favorites of ours like the marinated sea bass and some hand rolls. It was all so fresh, delicious and good! The bill reflected our gluttony but I don't think we regretted it at all. I actually think I like this place a bit better than Sushi Sam's in San Mateo because they don't sauce everything, in fact they don't really sauce anything so you can truly taste what the fish is supposed to be like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-07", "description": "My first time trekking out to the Sunset but it was totally worth it!\n\nFirst impression was that there was a small and crowded sushi bar, but the main dining area was very roomy. The decor is modern, but the beams in the ceiling reminded me of Japan. Lighting was a sultry low, so this is a great place for a date if you can get one of the booths (tables are not as private).\n\nAs other reviewers have highlighted, the Spoonful of Happiness is a must. One spoon is uni, a quail egg, tobiko, and ponzu. This was amazing! You taste the uni first, because it's sweet and rich and just all around delicious. Then you taste the egg, which is rich and creamy and, well, eggy. The crunchy tobiko is a great addition to the smooth textures of the uni and egg. Ponzu adds slight acidity and saltiness to balance the sweet. I didn't have the other spoon, which was monkfish liver, sea bream, truffle oil, and ponzu. (I have bad experiences with monkfish liver.) But judging by the ingredients, I'd say the textures and flavors are very well balanced too. Great way to start off the meal!\n\nWe also got the black cod, which comes in a bowl with dashi, tofu, and bok choy. This dish has never been presented to me in a broth, it's always on a plate with some grated daikon. I didn't mind the dashi, but hoped it didn't make the fish too soggy. Although it wasn't the best preparation of miso black cod I've ever had, it was pretty good. The fish was fresh (rule #1) and it wasn't overcooked (rule #2). The result is buttery sweet flaky goodness!\n\nKoo has a wide selection of sushi and crazy rolls. We didn't opt for any of the crazy stuff, but stuck with the spicy tuna instead. It was one of the best spicy tuna rolls I've ever had: chunky pieces of tuna, spicy mayo was not too spicy, and I liked the nice addition of a leaf of lettuce.\n\nDefinitely would come back to try some of the crazy rolls and fresh sushi!", "author": "Sherry L."}

We usually make reservations so no waiting. Fish always fresh and rolls/ nigiri always tasty. One time, my gf and I sat at this weird corner table that they had. I was facing the walls and my gf was facing the window.

We just made our decision coming here this afternoon and had no problem making reservation. Anyway, though we didn't have to wait in line, the food here was really good. \n\nWe ordered many dishes, like:\nSashimi combo\nBeef tataki:\nTwo way scallop\nUrchin nigiri, spanish mackerel nigiri, water eel nigiri\nYellowtail& avocado temaki, dynamite temaki\n\nMy friend and I love all the dishes we had here, the sashimi taste good. The two way scallop is pretty interesting and creative, there are four scallops, two with lemon sauce, other two on the beets, both of the two flavors are new adventures for me. The nigiri there are good, too! I love their eel nigiri so much since the eel served warm and very tender. In addition, I love the dynamite temaki, I suggest everyone add a quail egg on it! The dynamite temaki was served with baked scallop and wasabi, but the quail egg mix with wasabi and made me feel the flavor of wasabi was not too strong.

I even ordered more, something I rarely do. That is what made this experience worth the price tag (very high) and the B-list treatment at the door. \n\nSkip the eggplant (from the grill) - very oily and you don't get much.

Also, don't take 9 reservations at 8:00pm and none at 8:15pm (I saw the reservation book while waiting). They should be spread-out. The sushi bar was also backed up, so the foods from the kitchen arrived first and then the sushi items appeared which meant the order of the food was incorrect.\n\nThe food from the kitchen was typical. The first dish to come out was the spinach and asparagus in a sesame mustard sauce. The spinach was traditional, but it was oversauced. The grilled eggplant in sweet miso with ginger was straight-forward and usual. Although we should have had this at the end of the meal, the tempura fried smelt with curry in the coating came at the front end. They used a nicely delicate amount of curry in an otherwise ordinary fry coating.\n\nThe food from the sushi bar was the highlight of the restaurant. As seen in the other Yelp reviews, the \"spoonful of happiness\" is the signature dish here. One order is hard to share. So if there are two diners, then order two. It also comes with a sake shot so make sure someone at the table likes cold sake. One order comes with two different spoons. Start with the egg spoon with uni, raw quail yolk, and tobiko caviar and then the savory spoon with monkfish liver wrapped in raw fish and dressed in ponzu with white truffle oil. The decadent ingredients create decadent results for the taste buds.\n\nOur sushi order finished the dinner. We selected sushi from the \"Catch of the Day\" menu in hopes of getting really good raw fish. Our emphasis was to taste fish caught in Japan regardless of the variety (or radioactive isotope count) which covered the smooth-flavored deep sea red snapper, the mild barracuda, the average Spanish mackerel, the sweetly buttery sea bream, and the more delicately flavored baby sea bream. The baby sea bream was so good, we ordered more. We also tried the wild king salmon from Alaska because it's salmon run season. It was tender, but not overly flavorful.\n\nAll the sushi suffered from being under seasoned. My guess is that the dining crowd wasn't very savvy because the majority of the guests ordered soybeans and sushi rolls. Perhaps the chefs expect their common guests to drown the sushi in an overpowering slurry of salty soy and hot wasabi instead of accepting the sushi as complete when served.", "author": "Brian U."}

The sushi was some of the best I've had in the area.  The fish was fresh and everything was presented beautifully.\n\nThe first time I stuck with some specialty rolls.  The Tokyo Crunch was great and I really enjoyed the Flying Kamikaze.  And then the next time I went somewhat more exotic (rather, my dining partner did).  We started with the Spoonful of Happiness.  I didn't know what to expect.  I'll admit that I didn't enjoy the uni spoon all that much, but the ankimo wrapped with whitefish was phenomenal.  I can see why this is such a popular item.  He tried the baby octopus salad, apparently it is quite good but I wasn't in love.  Perhaps I'm not adventurous enough...  We had a smattering of other great items, and I definitely enjoyed the Best Roll.\n\nKoo happens to be on the pricier side, so I don't know how frequently I'd return when I'm paying for myself.  But it is cute for a more romantic date night or a night out with friends.  I suggest reservations if you are going to be there at a popular time (after 7pm) as it can get crowded.", "author": "Michelle K."}

However, knowing she enjoys sushi treats and hearing many good things about this place, I went ahead and called in for a reservation. The rest of the experience went smoothly. Upon arrival, we found great street parking (right across the street) and was seated immediately. Upon staring at the menu, you don't see the omakase option but you can ask your server to bring that menu out. The omakase is definitely worth the price you are paying for. There are 3 omakase options. Obviously, the higher the price, the more you get to try. I wanted to enjoy a little bit of everything on their menu so we opt for the $70 omakase and there were no regrets. Everything was perfection from the start to finish. The food was amazing! My friend couldn't stop saying \"This is so f*cking delicious. This is the best sh*t ever!\" --- Well, well, someone was enjoying herself a little too much!

But it wasn't meant to be. I would really give Koo more of a 3.5 stars but opted to give it the 4 because the spoonful of happiness was really good. \n\nIt's pretty awesome. I mean, its wasn't orgasmic like the 1849 oysters at kabuto but it's pretty close. Initially, I felt like the Ponzu sauce was a bit overwhelming that it masked the natural and complex flavors of the uni, but this spoon was all about textures. Once you get over the excess Ponzu sauce, it really was delightful with all the tobiko and quail egg popping in your mouth. \n\nThe second spoon was yellow tail wrapped around ankimo. The crisp crunchy hamachi really complimented the creamy ankimo well. As a palate cleanser, smooth sake went in between spoons. It was an innovative and exciting culinary adventure, so thrilling, I ordered 2 helpings. \n\nIn addition, we ordered the uni + tobiko ($5.50), hamachi and avocado, and dynamite handroll, all for $4 each. They were ok. The uni was creamy, slightly bitter though. Another honorable mention was the salmon/tuna tartare on shrimp chips, it was flavorful and aesthetically reminded me of salsa, but the taste and texture was much more sophisticated than your typical salsa ($13.00). All and all, the spoonful of happiness was the star player at Koo, everything else fell a bit short. \n\nServers were pretty nice as were the chefs, but I felt like we were rushed with the bill and our orders when the place wasn't full.  So that was a little obnoxious. Otherwise, i think Koo is worth a try to at least test out the spoonful of happiness. It will leave you in a blissful state.", "author": "Wendy L."}

When the catch-of-the-day list is longer than the regular menu, you know it's the real-fresh-sushi-deal :).\n\nAs a starter we tried the Spoonful of Happiness people rave about ($10.00 per person, can't share).  Basically comes as two spoons (one of uni and quail egg, the other of ankimo (monk fish liver) and whitefish) and a shot of sake to sip before and after (see my pic!)  Not sure I'd order this every time, but it's a must-try experience for first timers!!  The uni is quality stuff -- so you can prob do with half the amount of ponzu.\n\nMy suggestion is to skip the rolls (except the black cod), and stick with the fresh nigiri.  We tried quite a few, but our top 3 favs are below. All nigiris are about $6.50 for 2 pieces, which I think its affortable for this type of quality:\n--blue shrimp ...so so sweet.  people usually think i'm nuts for eating raw shrimp, but pretty sure they'd change their mind if they only tried this.\n--Moi (Sea Bass)\n--Haramasa (aussie yellowtail)\n\nOther items I tried that were decent, but not o-em-gee: \nGrilled Baby Octopus ($5) -- more like a octopus spinach salad...octopus was a bit bland.\nWild Salmon nigiri ($6.50) -- not the traditional buttery salmon -- texture was more rough like smoked salmon crossed with tuna...so i'm not a fan.\n \nFor those that don't like sashimi, the menu has lots of good cooked options too. Black cod ($15.00) was the only one i tried but OH MY COD ..i mean GOD :P..was it amazing.  I thought buttery reside only with sea bass, but Koo's cod literally melts in your mouth.  Dish comes in a light soy soup with baby bak choy...which is a good contrast to the grilled cod.  \n\nI know I had sworn that The House's Sea Bass dish (North Beach fusion restaurant) was the best fish I've had..but now i think it's a close tie.\n\nWill be back again for sure!\n\nP.s the beer and sake is good here too.

Why do you keep tempting Death by going to Japanese restaurants?\"\nA:  \"My friend said a Spoonful of Happiness from Koo is worth tempting Death.  I'll trust her on that one.\"\n\nA long day at the Jean Paul Gaultier exhibit with a friend and we needed to eat.  Maybe not too much but getting off of our feet for an hour or two would be good.  Oh snap I finally have a reason to eat on Irving Street!  Yelp-fu recommended Koo (is it pronounced 'kuu' or 'koh'?) so off we went.  I didn't have a huge appetite.  Whatever I ordered had to count.  Did I mention that I have seafood allergies and can't enjoy a spoonful of happiness?\n\nThings That Were Awesome:\n+++Presentation.  Everything looked good.  I looked at the tables next to us with envy.  Damn I should have gotten salad instead of beef tataki!\n+++Prompt service.  Maybe we came in on a good time.  It seemed like my friend and I were the only guests in the restaurant.\n+++Big plates.  They encourage you to share meals with their hot and cold plates.  Sushi and sashimi (and Spoonful of Happiness) are individual portions.\n+++Portion.  There is literally just enough food to feed you.  You're not here to stuff our face with okay sushi.  You're here to enjoy a few pieces of really good sushi.\n\nThings That Were Not So Awesome:\n---Price.  Yeah the price tags are going to be a huge hurdle.  Be smart when you order.\n---Small groups.  I wouldn't recommend swinging by if your party is more than 4 or 5.  A lot of tables for two up in hurrr.\n---Taste for price not matching.  Certain items could be priced better (looking at you, entree).  Sushi/sashimi/spoonful of happiness match, but not everything else.\n\nThings I Ate:\n*  Shiitake nigiri. - Best shiitake nigiri I ever had.  Lightly grilled and just a tad sweet.  Why must the vegetable sushi selection be so limited :foodie tears:\n*  Beef tataki. - Enough for two people.  My fatass ate all of it.  (GG Christine only 1 cup of yogurt =/= lunch.)  The tataki taste seemed to be masked by the sauce and everything garnishing the plate.\n*  Mint spare rib lettuce cup. - Enough for two people.  Topped with a whole lot of fried noodles.  Once I dug out the spare ribs they were cooked just right.  Might have used more spice.\n*  Yuzu creme brulee. - Yuzu is a mild citrus between lemon and lime in flavor.  This place does flavored creme brulee right.  It wasn't drowning in yuzu rinds and the texture wasn't fluffy cream.  This dessert made a chocolate addict switch teams for a night.\n\nIf nothing else, have the spoonful of happiness while you're here.

If you like smelt, then you will probably like this. You get a nice portion of deep fried smelt sprinkled with curry powder and salt. Not too much batter and it definitely had a great flavor.  It might be a little too salty for some people but I enjoyed it. Very addicting.

Oh and FYI, it only came with 4 pieces.\n\nDid I mention they have FRESH wasabi here? However, they charge you $1 for it. Taste sooo much better than the powdered stuff! This is the second Japanese restaurant I found that carries fresh wasabi. Kappa is the other one. \n\nOur total was around $98 (including tip).

We told the waitress and asked her about the dish but she didn't apologize about the cold fish or say much about the rotten taste.  All three of us noticed something was off, so it wasn't just my tastebuds.    We also tried the Azteca Roll.

DK found this place and sushi was the perfect meal prior to a weekend of dragon boating. He had reservations and we were seated immediately. \n\nTook a while for someone to bring us drinks and a menu, but once we got it, the party started. We had to order the \"Spoonful of Happiness,\" because even if you're a mean SOB and you hate the world, you can't really hate anything with a name like that. \n\nIt's really two spoonfuls with a shot of chilled sake. One was fish and the other was uni and boy, was it a lot of uni. Might be intimidating to someone who's never had sushi, or who can't hang, but it's definitely an accomplishment to just throw back those two spoonfuls. I'm not a fan of uni and have only had it once before, but really enjoyed both spoons (AK was going to go with the fish one first and I was like, \"Are you crazy? You want to end with the uni??\"). It helped to have the sake to wash everything down though (eat one, sip the sake, eat the other, shoot the rest of the sake). The sake was smooth and a perfect complement to the fish. \n\nWe ordered a few things between us and each item had the familiarity of what you would expect from a roll with those respective ingredients, but had just enough of a twist to it to make it unique:\n\n(Rolls vary between 5-8 pieces)\nAwesome: Catch of the Day - Tempura crab with a garlic ponzu dipping sauce. (not a roll, just an appetizer)\nGreat: Tokyo Crunch - Spicy Tenkasu, Hamachi, Unagi, Cucumber and Tobiko\nGreat: Spicy Tuna - Spicy Tuna, Cucumber and Lettuce\nOkay (my least favorite): Azteca - Crab, Avocado, Gobo and Cucumber Wrapped in White Fish, topped w/ a thin slice of Jalepeno, Spicy Mayo, Tobiko & Ponzu then lightly baked\nAwesome: Best Roll - Tempura Asparagus, Avocado, wrapped in Fresh Salmon & thin slice of Lemon \nGreat: Flying Kamikaze - Spicy Tuna and Asparagus wrapped with Albacore and topped with Garlic Ponzu and Scallions\n\nService was good, food came out in a timely manner, and it got really crowded, especially around 9 pm.\n\nWith all that, the bill came out to $107 or so and we were all stuffed with happiness.

How can I really describe it... \nIt's like...hmm...Sure, tuna bellies have more fat than other fishes or tuna parts, but you don't find them as much oily as you'd be in need of beer or soda to chug down and refresh yourself.

I wanted to give this place another try, so third time's the charm right?\n\nI was really excited about this place because the catch of the day fish selections were exciting and different from your typical sushi restaurant. \n\nBut when the nigiri arrived.. the fish was a bit mushy and bland. The three different kinds of fish (tai, kinmadai, kohada) tasted the same and having had these nigiri before at my fav sushi joint of all time, I know what it could taste like if it were fresh.\n\nEh. Did these more uncommon selections of fish just not sell to the masses? Was it sitting in their display case for a week? Sigh.. Even the uni was mediocre and fishy tasting.. it's the kind of uni a first timer puts in their mouth and can't fathom why people would eat something like that. \n\nFor that price, I expect more.

I must have walked past the place a few dozen times and always just wrote it off as being too expensive for anything but a special occasion yet not special enough to be on my list whenever one of those occasions arrived. Then we didn't get into any of the extra-fancy places we'd wanted to for my birthday dinner so I went and looked up the nearest-bestest sushi place. Which was this.\n\nHighlights:\nSoft shell crawfish handroll - temporary, special, and to die for. We kept ordering more. It comes with little red claws sticking out of it (I have a picture somewhere on here). My favorite of the evening.\n\nCaledonia Blue shrimp nigiri - it really *is* blue\n\nTwo way Scallops - also to die for, although the lemon-ginger was my favorite\n\nLychee sakei - fantastic, if tiny\n\nFRESH nigiri - including many on the \"catch of the day\" list which had comparable prices to their happy hour specials\n\nDessert - I don't think I've ever been in a sushi restaurant before where (once you're over the novelty of mochi) it was worth sticking around for dessert. Try the chocolate and the cheesecake.\neavesdropping - for some reason our neighbors were extra entertaining this evening\n\nLowlights:\nMiso Black Cod - we might have liked it if we had not already been irreparably spoilt by Sushi Kazu down the street. (Don't bother with Miso Cod anywhere else IMHO) Also, the bok choy it came with was stringy.\n\nLychee sake - the serving is 2-3 oz, but it's listed in the same column as a bunch of other sakes which are 5 oz. So we were disappointed when it came.\n\nI don't know if the place has changed, or if it was because we ordered so many things off the special menu or what, but I didn't think Koo was that pricey. I'd put it on about the same level as EOS, which is costly but not exceptionally so.", "author": "Amy T."}

These are both served with a shot of chilled sake that is meant to be sipped between spoonfuls. The sake pairs nicely with the food but also cleans your palate just enough to ready your taste buds for the next spoon. All in all, it is a marrying of flavors that complement each other. \n\nYou will also find here the much coveted Asahi Kuronama beer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-04-01", "description": "Updated (12 Jan 07)\nWe just came back from the best Omakse course in SF!  Thanks Dan V., we had an amazing meal with great sake.  Credit to their excellent food, we finished an entire bottle of sake (& another glass) in no time .  The meal was a nice balanced mixture of 'nama-mono' (raw fish dishes) and cooked dishes.  What really separates places like Koo from 'the pretenders' is the details.  From wasabi to goma-sauce, they put in an extra effort to make it the best.  Quality of gyu-tan (beef tongue) was the quality you get at a nice restaurant in Tokyo.  You can count on 'professional' quality dishes at Koo.  For what you are getting, their prices are amazingly great value.  Having the kind of omakase course meal in Japan for less than 10,000 Yen ($100) is unthinkable.  With sake and desserts, it was about $90/person, but if you don't drink alcohol or order dessert, you could enjoy their course for around $60/person.\n\nOriginal Review (01 Apr 06)\nLiving in SOMA near financial district, I normally avoid driving to Sunset district for dinner, but after seeing some good reviews about Koo by Yelpers --- including #3 Best SF Japanese Restaurant according to Dan V. --- we decided to go for a hike.  As predicted, Friday night traffic from Harrison to 9th , to Hayes, to Gough, to Fell, and finally to Irving was painful, but I quickly discovered that it was all worth it.  \n\nWow!\n\nGreat find!  Restaurant is not so big (max capacity sign read 48) so calling 30 minutes ahead for a table was a smart move.  As you walk in, there is a nice well lit sushi counter area to the left, sort of separated from the more dim lighting dining area to the right.\n\nFOOD:  Awesome authentic Japanese food --- so far best I've had in SF.  We ordered a bunch of dishes to share along with sushi and sashimi.  Some of the highlights include:\n\n* Tuna and salmon tartar: If California roll is good with avocado and tuna, why not tuna with spicy guacamole with shrimp chips?  It was a very nice creative dish.\n\n* Eggplant dengaku:  Nice miso sauce!  Excellent.\n\n* Grilled Asparagus:  Such a simple dish, but the flavoring was tasty.\n\n* Tempura wakasagi (smelt fish) curry-salt:  Never had smelt prepared this way.  Great with beer.\n\n* Miso marinated black cod:  By keeping the sauce flavor just right so that you can taste the fish.  Very good.\n\nSushi and sashimi was also very good, but I was more impressed with their prepared Japanese dishes.  We had a load to eat (knowing we didn't have to pickup the check), drank beer and sake, yet it came out to $40/person, which was very reasonable.  We could have easily kept it under $30/person and still could have had a good meal.\n\nIn other part of the country, a place like Koo targeted Japanese businessmen, but that wasn't the case with Koo.  Most of the customers we saw were non-Japanese, yet most of the wait staff were Japanese and as earlier stated, they serve solid authentic Japanese food.  What I'm trying to say is that I'm quite happy that restaurant like Koo could survive and stay popular without Americanizing their taste and service.  Hats off to customers that support restaurants like this.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-30", "description": "After reading several reviews from my friends and hearing about their awesome Happy Hour specials, the bf and I decided to give it a go.\n\nAt first glance, Koo is almost very easily missed if you just drove by and wasn't looking for it. It's centered on its block and hidden behind a couple of trees. \n\nAs I stepped into the restaurant, I noticed the lighting and decor. It was very different from what I had expected. The lights were slightly dim and the hangings on their walls were kind of a traditional Japanese with a modernized twist. It was simple and not too over the top elegant, so dressing casually won't make you feel out of place. \n\nMaybe since it was a Tuesday, it wasn't crowded and we were seated right away. We were given the HH menu along with the regular dinner menu. We aren't big on handrolls, so we passed on those on the HH menu. We did order the large house hot sake for $5, the wakame salad $5, and another salad, forgot the name of it....also $5. Good deal.\n\nFor the main dishes, we decided on the Azteca, Tokyo Crunch & Dragon Rolls. The bf got the beef spareribs with butter lettuce wraps and I got the miso marinated black cod. Of all the rolls, my favorite was the Azteca. It had a \"punch\" of spicy ness to it that was not over powering. The fish was fresh and they didn't make it with a ton of rice. The butter lettuce wraps were very refreshing and definitely something different that was very worth trying. My miso black cod tasted good, but it was floating in a bowl of soy sauce soup....it made it a bit too salty. \n\nOf course, as everyone recommends, we had to order the \"spoonful of happiness\" ....amazingly, it was delicious. I'm not a huge fan of uni...but with the addition of a quail egg, it made it less fishy and more buttery. Not bad. The spoon with the sashimi was so yummy! the shot of sake that same along with this dish really added on to the experience. It definitely is a must try....at least once!\n\nFor the service, this is where they lost a star....sadly, I have to agree to with gf Natalie...who also yelped about their slow and inattentive service. We had to ask the waitresses twice for ginger, and when they asked if we wanted to see the dessert menu, we said sure. After about 15 mins, they never even came back to see what we decided for dessert. We got very impatient and just changed our minds and asked for the check instead. That was about the downfall of our experience tonight. The place wasn't even busy, so they don't really have any other reason to forget or not follow through. \n\nGood sushi spot, but not the only one out there...if you do come, try the HH specials and must get the \"spoonful of happiness\".", "author": "Christina T."}

This is definitely one order per person.\n\nTuna and Salmon Tartare: Not too generous on the amount of tuna/salmon, but it was the right amount for the number of shrimp chips they give you.  Slightly dry; I wished they marinated the tuna and salmon with lemon juice.\n\nMiso Marinated Black Cod: It was succulent and tasty.  Portion was not too big.

I'm fairly sure that it was some kind of bacteria from the fish or eel.

I called this place and they said they had it. When we arrived, I asked twice more, once when we walked in and second when we were sitting down. I spoke very slowly and explained very clearly that we wanted the LIVE uni and were told they had it. When we started ordering the server immediately said they did not have it at all. I was too shocked as I asked a total of 3 times.\n\nSo as we were disappointed but figured let's make the best of it.\n\nThe second scam was we decided to order sashimi. We ordered wild king salmon, maguro (tuna) and albacore tuna. The fish came out stringy, somewhat irregular shapes as they were like scraps of the fish as my date promptly pointed out. We were so dismayed we called onto the server, whom sent the original server away and told us the other server was off duty while he was still working at the table as we can see. She then told us the sashimi single [sic] were smaller because the bigger pieces would be \"MORE EXPENSIVE\"! \n\nWHAT?!!! First, there was no separate pricing for \"smaller\" pieces. Second, they insulted patrons as if we would not be able to afford them. We were so upset and described that they cannot serve scraps to customers, period. My date pointed out that the pieces were so small you can't even taste them properly. And the albacore was still having the frozen ice in it. We returned the dish.\n\nThird scam was we ordered the sea snail and we asked twice if they were served raw or cooked. The server said raw, twice. They were served boiled.\n\nThis restaurant was arrogant and thought they could scam customers by thinking patrons were stupid and would take whatever they were served.\n\nWe had ordered a bunch of other things in between the scams-- spoon of happiness had way too much ponzu sauce and the fish was not too good as it's not smooth taste and stringy. Salmon and tuna tartare and Ice fish nigiri were just okay. The only saving grace was the uni nigiri which was better.\n\nBut I would not have to track out there to have regular uni.\n\nI would tell all my friends and Yelpers to stay away from this place because they disrespect their patrons.", "author": "T L."}

The sashimi was fresh and the slices were perfectly cut. From what I know, sashimi HAS to be sliced thinly to showcase flavor. Sashimi taste bad when it is thick. The sashimi was also very soft,creamy, and buttery and it literally melted in my mouth. We also ordered miso soup($2.50), nd it was delicious! Then we got a plate of eggplant dangku, dessert and 8 other pieces of sushi. The sesame mousse and mochi was the BEST I've ever had. The texture of the mousse was very creamy, and the green tea mochi was creamy. The atmosphere was also very nice! Oh yeah, we arrived around 8pm and we were seated right away.

They have the best rice I've had in the city, which is not to say that I understand why people get rolls when they come here.  Omakase or just nigiri is the way to go here.   To the person who gave Koo a low review because they could get \"thicker cuts of sushi for half the price elsewhere\", do not go to Japan, you will hate all the sushi there.  The Japanese quantify good sushi by not just the quality of fish and rice, but also the knife skills of the chef.  FYI, each pieces of nigiri are meant to fit perfectly in your mouth, not spilling out of the side so that you can get \"more bang for the buck\".  Chef Hayakawa cuts each slices of sushi perfectly, I recommend to ask him about his knives- he has quite a collection :).    To end my review-  you NEED to get the Spoonfuls of Happiness.

We came around 6pm with no reservations and luckily didn't have to wait.  The place is small and quaint and easily passable on the streets.  \n\nParking: It may be more difficult to find parking on the streets, go more towards Golden Gate Park area and there should be plenty of parking there and it's only a few blocks down.\n\nSo the four of us ordered quite a few things on the menu, afraid that would still leave us hungry.\n\n- A Spoonful of Happiness:  A spoonful of uni, quail egg, tobiko ponzu & a spoonful of ankimo wrapped with whitefish, white truffle-oil ponzu, and comes with a shot of chilled sake. ($10)\n- Bamboo Tower (Crystal sesame-ponzu, mizuna green with fresh white fish, scallops and shrimp)\n- Chicken Teriyaki with potato salad (Chutney-teriyaki glazed thighs of chicken)\n- Sashimi Combo 12pcs (Maguro, Hamachi, Salmon, White-fish 3pcs each)\n- Azteca Roll: (crab,avocado, gobo and cucumber wrapped in white fish, topped w/ a thin slice of jalepeno , spicy mayo, tobiko & ponzu then lightly baked) \n- Tokyo Crunch (Spicy tenkasu, hamachi, unagi, cucumber and wasabi tobiko) \n- Miso Soup in Black Cod: (Dashi branched baby bok choy and fried tofu)\n\nA Spoonful of Happiness: It lived up to their hype on yelp. It really is two spoonfuls of happiness into your mouth. ::mouth salivating::  It was something different I've never had and it was delicious. I slurpity slurp the first bite of Uni and it was so SMOOTH.  The whitefish was really tender as well.  I took a little sip of sake before/after each bite and the  sake worked well with the saltiness of the ponzu sauce.  I could have had 5 more of these. Yum.  Due to my one shot wonder, I didn't even finish the sake and was buzzing real good the rest of dinner.    \n\nBamboo Tower:\nThis salad is like the perfect summer salad. It was tangy, sweet and crisp.  They presented it by pulling out the bamboo and all the seafood towered over the salad. Great starter. \n\nChicken Teriyaki with potato salad:\nOut of everything we ordered, I would say this was mediocre.  Don't come here for ordinary american-japanese food, come here for the tender fish/sushi! \n\nSashimi Combo:\nUm, can I say TENDER? (That's what she said.)   Each type of sashimi was so soft, my family demolished this dish fast.  I wish they gave a little more considering the price. \n\nAzteca and the Tokyo Crunch Rolls: \nDelicious and crunchy! The waiter recommend these two and both were freshly cut and baked with a great crisp to it. \n\nMiso Marinated Black Cod: \nUm. Yes. Wow. Tender. Juicy. Soft. No bones. The soup was so tasty along with the tofu/bok choy in it. Best way to end the meal.  \n\nI give this place five stars purely for the spoonful of happiness and the black cod.  It was more on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Everything was delicious and fulfilling to our taste buds, unfortunately not filling enough for our stomachs.  Good thing we got Humphry Slocombe ice cream after and had Ike's sandwiches take out.  I will definitely come back for only the special dishes and to try more sushi!", "author": "Cam C."}

They cleaned up my chopstick clumsiness when bringing the dessert menu; you'd be surprised how many places fail to do that. \n\nCon: However, in an uncrowded pre-holiday crowd, the tempura came out while I was still drinking the miso and the cod came out while I was still eating the tempura, with the corresponding impact on the hotness of the food. I'd rather have waited a few minutes between courses and had hot food. After all, I had the edamame to snack on. They asked me about dessert while I was munching on the edamame. The place was half-full at that point so there was no need to rush.\n\nAlso, they placed the menu on top of the bare chopsticks and the dessert spoon directly on the table, which, as I've mentioned in reviews of other restaurants, is a squick for me.\n\nNevertheless, the quality of the food and the pleasantness of the environment earns this place a place on my splurge list.", "author": "Charles B."}

I would have never expected to find such a great japanese restaurant here. \n\nI really liked my first as well as my second experience here. Both times I ordered pretty much the same. Second time, we tried even more things.  Love the food, the service and the place itself. It's pretty cozy.  There's a dining area and there's also a sushi bar. Both times I ate at the dining area and happened to sit on the same table. weird. i know. \n\nFirst time I had:\nBest Roll\nAzteca Roll\nU2 Roll\nFlying Kamikaze Roll\n\nMy favorite of the four rolls would have to be the Best Roll. It consisted of all things I like to eat. I loved the fresh taste of the salmon that had a thin slice of lemon which added a little zest to it. I also really like asparagus and I thought it went really well with the roll. You can also never go wrong with avocado in sushi.\n\nMy second favorite of the rolls was the Azteca. It must have been the ponzu sauce and the fact that it was lightly baked, which made the white fish taste a little seared. It was delicious! I don't like spicy and I thought I would not like it because of the spicy mayo and the slice of jalapeno, but it wasn't too bad for me. I just scraped off the slice of jalapeno and the spicy mayo gave it a little kick!\n\nThen I liked the Flying Kamikaze Roll. We were really appealed by the name of the roll so we decided to order it. The deep fried bits of garlic really made this roll special. Even though it consisted of spicy tuna, which I am not too fond of, this roll wasn't too bad. Yummy asparagus and albacore.\n\nMy least favorite of the four had to be the U2 roll due to the spicy tuna. This roll was just way too spicy for me. I thought I would like it because I like avocado and shrimp tempura, but I actually found this roll to be really dry and plain.\n\nTuna and Salmon Tartar\nserved with spicy guacamole and shrimp chips\nI absolutely fell in love with this dish. I love the thickness of the shrimp chips. It was perfect so that we could scoop the tartar onto the chip without the chip breaking. I've tried tartar at a lot of places, and this one really stands out to me. I loved the presentation of it as well as the mixture of the guacamole with the fish tartar. It was seriously perfection in my mouth. I was so hooked on this!\n\nSecond time:\nI had the spoon full of happiness. Definitely worth the try. There's two spoons filled with a variety of sashimis.  It's definitely worth a try.\n\nHandrolls: \nWe got here when they were serving happy hour still and so we decided to order it.

Almost everything was fantastic. My only real complaint is that the smelt tempura really should come with a dipping sauce. \n\n$115 after tax & tip for two greedy eaters who had skipped lunch. \n\nOh, two more notes:\n\n1) 6-7pm on a weekday seems like a good time for families to come in - there were several seated with small children while we were there (I envy the parents who can afford this place). \n\n2) The edamame was cold, which seems to be a recently reoccurring problem for us, boo!", "author": "Jenn W."}

There are no bento boxes, donburis, or noodle items. There is a nice sake menu though. \n\nVIRG SAYS \"MEH\": \n\nI wasn't wowed by the small dishes offered here. The corn bread encrusted calamari and the miso-marinated sea bass were just okay and frankly, too salty. \n\nVIRG LIKES: \n\nI would return for the sushi and sashimi selections, which were definitely what I would expect from a quality establishment. Super fresh offerings, where you could taste the sweetness of each fish, scallop or shrimp. \n\nBut take note, HERE IS THE REASON WHY THIS PLACE IS DIFFERENT: they have a list of say 15 or so \"catch of the days.\" Here you will find items that are in addition to the usual sushi menu. Most notable for me on this particular visit was the New Caledonia blue shrimp (it was really blue) which blew my all time fave, amaebi, out of the water - no pun intended. They were also featuring Australian young yellow tail (Hiramasu), which we compared to the Japanese wild yellow tail (tenjyo-buri) - both very good, but the Australian version had a deeper, sweeter flavor. Also good to try, if available, was the shad gizzard (its a fish and has nothing to do with a chicken) and the sea bream. Both were from Japan. \n\nSEE THE DOLLAR SIGNS:\n\nIn terms of pricing, two pieces of sushi ran somewhere between $5.50 to $8.00, which is about what you'd expect to pay for good quality...dare I say it was a good value? I'm not a roll fan, but just for your info, they had them for about $15. So alcohol notwithstanding, you could walk out of there for about $50 per person.\n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nAt night, they feature tea lights on the black tables, which creates a nice, intimate glow to the place. \n\nCheck it out, peeps...I think you just might like this place :)", "author": "Virg Y."}

I love sushi and Japanese food in general so I eat it quite a bit and this is the best Japanese food I've had in San Francisco. The rice in the sushi rolls is very high quality, not too sticky or gummy like cheap (I assume) sushi rice. A superstar of a roll was the Best Roll (real name), which was a unique combo of ingredients and flavors I hadn't seen at other sushi places - Tempura asparagus, avocado inside and salmon with thin lemon slices on top - it all worked together so well. Even their standard spicy tuna roll was the best I have ever had.\nAND...The prices are very reasonable, given the high quality and generous portions (the amazingly good spicy tuna was $6 for 6 large pieces, Best Roll $8.50).

For the price they charge for the sushi, I would think that it'd at least taste decent. \n\nNote that they have dessert service charge of $2 per person so if you bring in a cake or something it will add extra $$ to the bill. We had 4 people so that was 8 extra dollars spent on a cake that we have forked a bit of money over. However, they were nice enough to give us a candle so we can wish our friend a Happy Birthday. The service was alright as they brought our food in an acceptable amount of time and refilled our teas several time since were were there for about 2 hours. The food was alright but a bit salty and I doubt I'd go back there unless I was in the area and desperate Japanese at the same time.", "author": "Annie T."}

I ordered the vegetable sushi combo... Which consisted of 9 pieces of super fresh types of vegetable creations.... the avocado and eggplant being my favorite! I also ordered the stuffed jalapenos with hamachi (cooked) served with lime aoili sauce ... what other sushi restaurant is going to have THAT? no where! it was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!\n\nI really wish we had room for dessert...

The sushi just tastes fresher than it does back home. My trusty Yelp app guided me to Koo and I was not disappointed. \n\nThe restaurant is not very big, but our maitre'd said she could seat us if we ate quickly (she had another party coming in with a reservation). The service was very quick and efficient so we were out of there in plenty of time, but we did not feel rushed at all. \n\nI ordered the sashimi assortment and I was surprised by how big the cuts were for the price. The tuna was my favorite of the bunch, but the sea bass and salmon were also very good. For $6 extra, I added miso soup, seaweed salad, and rice to my dinner. \n\nI shared the mochi and green tea ice cream with my sister. Mochi was pretty standard, nothing special about it. The green tea ice cream was great to cleanse the palate though. \n\nThe decor was pretty sparse; this was no Megu (my favorite sushi joint in NYC).

The ponzu sauce went very well with the monkfish liver.  My husband had the uni and he said it was amazing.  Next time, we're getting our own rather than sharing.  \n\nNext, we had the grilled octopus salad and the kumimoto oysters.  The oysters were great but I didn't love the octopus salad.

The cut of fish were not as large as other places I've been to, but they were still good and very fresh.  My husband ordered the geoduck and he thought it was a little fishier than others that he's tried before.\n\nFinally, despite all this food, I was not full (story of my life), so, I ordered the hamachi kama.

Koo is my newest discovery and I am definitely adding it to my list of favorite sushi places (along with Yuzu, Ozumo, and Kabuto).  Koo is a no-nonsense sushi joint with yummy rolls and most importantly FRESH fish. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nKamikazi Roll- Yum! Spicy tuna roll covered with albacore tuna. SO delicious, the best thing I had that night.\n\nBest Roll- Good but I wouldn't call it the best roll there. It's a roll filled with avocado and asparagus tempura, and covered with salmon and thin slices of lemon. \n\nHirame (halibut) sashimi special- several thin slices of very fresh halibut served with a side of ponzu sauce (I would recommend pouring it on top of the halibut since halibut is pretty flavorless) and a little pile of green onions and spicy grated daikon.\n\nWild White Salmon nigiri- This was a special catch of the day and it was amazing! I've never had raw white salmon--it looks and tastes almost like Toro- light pink fish with a buttery taste and feel. Very good.\n\nThe sushi rice here is also made very well in my opinion--nice and firm and just the right amount of seasoning. \n\nThe SERVICE was what I would expect in a casual sushi joint on Irving St- attentive and polite, but nothing special. They brought our food out fast and filled our tea regularly. \n\nThe DECOR isn't particularly special either- just a nice clean sushi place with modern decor, not fancy at all though. It would still be nice enough for a casual first date though.\n\nI'd definitely go back for the fresh fish and yummy rolls, and the prices were really good too ($56 total for 2 rolls, 1 order nigiri, 1 special sashimi plate).", "author": "amy k."}

I love uni when it's like a lovely sea-flavored sauce.  This was off, which was surprising because it was on the \"specials\" menu.  Perhaps it was a \"special\" not because it was special, but to turn-over inventory...\n\nKani, I like a nice piece of leg meat on my little ball of rice; Koo offers a crab-salad that tastes of mayonnaise.\n\nShiitake mushroom similarly could not hold a candle to fondly-remembered culinary delights.\n\nThings that were tasty:\nOysters\nFried calamari\nThe famed spoonful of happiness\nSoft-shell crab handroll\n\nI really wanted to like this place, because it's so near to my home.\n\nHere is why I cannot go back:\n     We had a party of three; my friend and I arrived and told the hostess that the third member of our party would be arriving at 6:15, about 25 minutes later.  The place was pretty empty.  So, we ordered drinks and appetizers.  At 6:15, our third called, to apologize, because she was having trouble parking.  At 6:40, the hostess came by our table and told us we had to be out by 7:30.  We told the hostess that our third was looking for parking.  She explained that people were coming in and she needed the table.\n     This was probatively false.  There were plentiful open tables, and naturally we started monitoring the foot traffic.  There was no crush of eager diners, more like crickets.\n     If we weren't ordering enough to pay their rent, our server surely could have handled one more table of non-existant diners...\n     Along these lines, I conform to the etiquette of taking-up restaurant space for protracted periods and was planning on tipping double.  Unfortunately, the hostess felt the need to lay down the law, leaving us no chance to reassure her, or to make a bargain.\n     When our third walked in not long after that, we had guessed what she'd like to eat and ordered.  Needless to say our suppositions were not spot on.\n\n     Our primary dining experience was very hurried and unnecessarily stressful.\n\n     Koo gets one star back, because our server was great.  In toto, I shan't be returning, and the quest continues.\n\n     I would be eternally grateful for a recommendation to a place where I can acquire Kani and Uni as described above.  The ideal location will be a bit closer than Samurai in San Diego.", "author": "Genevieve H."}

I had yet to eat at ANY restaurants in Inner Sunset and I have my eating buddy, Lisa, to thank for bringing me here. Apparently it helps to know the chef or at least insist at sitting at the bar to ask what is special and fresh.\n\nWe started with the ubiquitous \"Spoonfuls of Happiness\" - two soup spoons, one filled with a tai-wrapped smoked ankimo dressed with a bit of truffle oil and tobiko, the other a preparation of uni with quail egg and house-made ponzu sauce. The spoonfuls are served with a specialty sake and being an ankimo fan, I thought I would prefer that bite, but the freshness of the uni and the subtlety of the ponzu made the uni the preferred bite. \n\nNot wanting to get full on rice, we specifically requested sashimi -- with two slices each of maguro, tai aka, sake, hamachi, and and kanpachi. Note that the fresh, real wasabi is certainly a treat.\n\nIndicating we were definitely interested in \"unusual\" offerings, the chef made us a salad of light mizuna greens, thinly sliced cucumber, and baby raw whole shrimp and squid. I don't recall ever having been served whole squid the size of my thumb. Incredibly tender and lightly dressed, this was an amazing offering.\n\nAs my client requested salmon, a special offering of crudo was presented -- thinly sliced white salmon, so tender and bright.\n\nThere was also an unagi course, but I'm not remembering exactly how it was offered.\n\nWe finished up with my one request of the evening; ama-ebi, as my good friend, Lance (visiting from London), had never had a fried shrimp head before. Perfectly fresh sweet shrimp and the fried heads were light and crunchy. Just perfect.\n\nI brought a potential client and I'm sure we must have been given some deals as we drank a lot of sake, ate a lot of sushi, and the tab was only $300 for four.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

Kumomoto oyster, Magro sushi (Blue fin tuna from Japan), fresh scallops, hirame and baby snails - all catch of the day don't have much flavor.

I mean 'vintage' jeans wearing resident Japanese food expert Dan V. for lagging on the write up. I know, I know, it's been close to a month.. but thank you so much for taking me. Now that that's outta the way, on to the show!\n\n[ curtains open ]\nFriday night, Koo is packed to the brim, but as we walk in the entire staff stops to greet us and we're immediately shown to our seats at the counter. Right smack in front of Kiyoshi-san. Dan V. is VIP\n\n[ Act I ]\nAfter introductions and obligatory small talk (not a requisite but I am Japanese and we are bery bery porite -very very polite w/ a Japanese accent), Kiyoshi-san asks my likes and dislikes. Normally my 'like list' in first time establishments mirrors that of a lactose-intolerant-glucose-allergic-organic-vegan's \"Can Eat\" list. read: I am ridiculously picky unless the place has been tried and tested. However, I trust Dan, so I decided to put myself in the chef's hands (in case you don't know, 'omakase'  translated = \"I am in your hands\" kinda sexy)\n\n[ Act II ]\n.Scene 1: We get our drinks (Sapporo, in case you're wondering. I'm all about beer!!) and our first dish. Thinly sliced salmon and carmelized onions dressed with yuzu that blended beautifully. Dan liked his so much he inhaled it in 3 seconds. Ok I lied. It was more like 5 seconds. HA\n\n.Scene 2: Spoonful of happiness w/ the accompanying sake. It was everything I read about and more. Five minutes of heaven.  (no need for redundancy, this is one of Koo's signature dishes. If you're interested in descriptions, please read the other reviews)\n\n.Scene 3: Sugar snap peas in dashi based cold soup-like marinade. From the temperature, texture, to the flavoring, it was close to perfection. I woulnd't be surprised if they homegrew the peas on a mother of all pea plants in the back, it was that good. And I don't even like sugar snap peas.\n\n.Scene 4: Trio of bite sized appetizers.  In flavor-o-meter order (light to bursting!) \nun = salt and pepper giant prawn atop thinly sliced grilled potato   \ndeux = salmon and tuna tartare on a shrimp wafer like cracker \ntrois =  shishito filled ebi \n\nExtremely fresh shrimp is at times overly sweet  -especially when passed through heat, and I usually crave a lil kick. Kiyoshi-san prepared the prawn with a tad more pepper than salt. The natural sweetness was subtly enhanced while my kick was satisfied without any imbalance of flavors. Amazing. AND all three had distinctive tastes, yet not too far away from the other that my palate got confused. Pure genius *The tartar and shishito are on the regular menu. \n\n.Scene 5: Oysters on a half shell. Self explanatory. I think the oysters had a fancy name but I forgot. I was too busy eating.\n\n.Scene 6: Crab tarine.... or in plain Engrish salad in cylinder form. Chunks of THE meatiest, freshest, sweetest crab tossed with avocado, lil mayo, a lil mustard(maybe?), and some other ingredients I forgot. What I DO remember, is that even though I consumed avocado two dishes before, I was not bothered by its presence. At all... which is rare since similar tastes, textures, and ingredients bore me. \n\nKiyoshi-san also chose this time to tell me Dan gave him the heads up that I was a homesick ex-Bay Arean visiting from Manhattan so he themed our menu 'Tastes of California' ...and it worked. Perfectly. I can't even begin to imagine how much thought and creativity was put into this omakase.\n\n\n\n[ intermission ]\n15 minute break from writing the review, not the actual dinner\n\n\n\n[ ...cont Act II ]\n\n.Scene 7: Smoked Ankimo. pure luxury. just try it.\n\n.Scene 8: Live hotate and kimo sashimi on the shell. SUPER fresh. amazing.\n\n[ climax ]\nshashimi (i forgot exactly what was served. go figure) then nigiri galore (not in order: akagai, aji, iwashi, saba, toro, anago, hirame, kinnmedai, and a few others i forgot.... ) super duper fresh. everything good\n\n[ conclusion ]\naji no hone,  the bones w/ a little bit of meat attached toasted to a crunchy, non prickly perfection. it's like... non-fishy fish chips, if you can imagine that. one of my favorite 'desserts'  when drinking. it refreshes my palate\n\n[ encore ]\ni HAD to try the mt. fuji (chocolate cake w/ a white chocolate base) w/ muscat dessert wine since it's hand made by the chef's wife, Ayumi-san... and was NOT disappointed. Quite the talented pair I tell you.\n\n\nThat night i was the happiest girl in the whole entire world\nFor anyone stating Koo is mediocre, please sit at the bar and order omakase. (ask Dan V if you can drop his name too)\n\n...and this concludes my longest. yelp review. ever. EVERRRR!! \n\n[ Curtains Close ]\n\n*i got a tad lazy w/ descriptions after the intermission\nate lunch and brain fell into a food coma\n\nedit!! i forgot one of THE best dishes, the chawan-mushi, the most satisfyingly complex with tons of layers that tickled alllll my senses. ok now i'm really done. the end", "author": "Mona N."}

Then she gave me a third degree burn on my face when she poured tea rather carelessly (seemed intentional to me) and it splattered all over my face. I don't know if they offer dessert because she brought our check and slammed it on the table without ever offering us a dessert menu.

The sushi-savvier folks in my party agreed that the quality of the fish was unimpeachable, and, frankly, every roll I ate was like a drop of rain in the desert.\n\nOn the other hand, I wonder if that's because it took nearly an hour for the sushi to come out, and in the meantime we'd been downing sake, hardly an appetite suppresant.  Starving stomachs rarely make for picky palates.  Not that the wait was unenjoyable--the dark wood beams over cream-colored walls and the just-right lighting make an ideal atmosphere.\n\nBut I guess my biggest complaint comes down to this: for these kind of prices (there's a $20-per-person minimum that you'll have no problem reaching well before you're full), where's the flair?  The boldness?  The fun?  Aside from a couple well-placed jalapenos, all the rolls were awfully stodgy and conservative.  Those Jimisan guys aren't afraid to put raspberry dressing on their sushi, even at the risk of stealing the thunder from the fish itself.  I dunno, maybe that's just where the hard-core sushi lovers and I differ.", "author": "Wes M."}

After an hour or so, and $130 at Koo, I had to say I was solely disappointed, and here is why in detail.\n\nWhile Koo had abundant selection of some hard to find fishes, they fell short in the presentation of these high end seafood. Blue Shrimp, or the special Agi would taste more scrumptious with a gentle touch of lime, or a bit of ponzu sauce. If you have tried out Sushi Sam Omikase you'd know what I am talking about. \n\nThe poor quality of sushi rice marked the downfall of Koo on Friday night, as it was way too salty and lacked sweetness and texture. This is really unforgivable, as sushi rice should always been sacrosanct at high end Japanese cuisine like this. I couldn't be any more let down. :( Places like Sushi Sam, Shimo, and Live Sushi bar all have authentically prepared sushi rice just to name a few.  \n\nThe overall quality of raw food here was at least decent, but nothing to die for. Uni sushi did regain certain reputation for Koo, as the Uni stayed true to Paulina C's review, it is sweet and fresh enough even with the unimpressive sushi rice.  \n\nI would assume Koo isn't totally bad for a neighborhood favorite, and maybe they do have better quality sushi rice on any other day, but it will never justify my 30+ minutes of driving all the way from San Mateo.", "author": "Wei H."}

They seated us as soon as we walked in and I noticed that there was a cute guy sitting next to me and he was by himself! Score! However, I was with my two girlfriends and we were pretty engrossed in our own conversation, even though I kept stealing glances over to the guy sitting next to me. I have a soft spot for any man who knows how to enjoy good sushi. Sadly, he left shortly after we got there and then I was left with no cute guys in the restaurant... \n\nOkay, onto the food part, Koo's \"Spoonful of Happiness\" (1 spoon of monk fish liver wrapped in halibut sashimi and the other spoon is uni with quail egg and truffle oil) is a must and my friends and I all felt very happy after that. We then had various sashimi, ranging from pen shell to Hawaiian amberjack to white tuna belly (our favorite) and of course toro. The service was good too, as they always kept our teacups full and cleared our plates as soon as we finished something. \n\nKoo is a fairly authentic Japanese restaurant ran by very friendly folks.

Everything was impeccably fresh and absolutely delicious. The service is great and they take reservations!!!!!! I LOVE that, since so many Japanese restaurants don't and you end up waiting for hours. It is a elegant, refined atmosphere. I was there on a Wednesday evening, and it was relatively quiet around 8pm. My dining companion and I sat at the bar and basically had one sushi chef to ourselves. Pretty f-ing rad! (Yes, I am singlehandedly reviving the word \"rad\").\n\nYou HAVE to start with the \"Spoonful of Happiness\" -- Spoonful of Uni, Quail Egg, Tobiko, Ponzu & Ankimo wrapped with whitefish, Truffle-Oil &  a shot of chilled Sake -- absolutely mind-blowingly full of complex flavors and textures.\n\nWe had the halibut sashimi special which was wonderful... It came with a Ponzu dipping sauce and the fish was sliced so thinly that you could see through it!\n\nAlso had the aji (Spanish mackerel) nigiri and the kona kanpachi (Hawaiian amberjack). Both were absolutely delicious and the aji was the best I've ever tasted. The hamachi sashimi was so rich and fresh that it simply melted in our mouths. \n\nWe had the negi-toro roll, which was probably the weakest fish of the evening, in comparison to the others. As Fong later explained to me, negi-toro is simply the lowest grade of toro cut up into tiny pieces so that the less impressive flavor is not as noticeable.\n\nThe dragon roll, with tempura shrimp, unagi, and avocado was perfectly done... very light and tasty.\n\nNotice and enjoy the fresh wasabi: it tastes amazing and makes such a difference!

The food is visually stunning, from the way the sushi is rolled to the spoonful of happiness, it all looks amazing.  \n\nA few recommendations of rolls I have if you are having trouble deciding are: \n\n-The Azteca Roll. It has a lot going on but all the flavors and textures go very well together. From the crunch of the cucumber to the smooth texture of the white fish to the spiciness of the jalapeno and mayo, blends very nicely.\n-The Flying Kamikaze Roll. With the smoothness of the spicy tuna and albacore it's nice to have the asparagus and scallions to add a bit of texture and it goes together brilliantly.\n-The Best Roll. Now finally onto my favorite roll of all of them. Tempura asparagus in the middle wrapped with the avocado, a slice of the most fresh salmon laid on top, and topped with a supremely thinly sliced quarter of lemon. All of which compliment each other perfectly. the crunch of the tempura asparagus, the smooth textures of the salmon and avocado, all finished off with a very refreshing citrus taste from the lemon.\n\nI would also recommend the Beef Tataki. Thinly sliced rare beef, with an apple ginger topping and green onions and alfalfa sprouts. It's a great way to start the meal.\n\nJust a great restaurant all in all. The flavors, textures, and visuals just all go together so wonderfully as signs of a proven and very experienced sushi chef.", "author": "Brendon L."}

But, after Tsugu-chan and Furui-san exchanged pleasantries, Furui-san took our phone number and said she'd call when a table was ready.  Tsugu-chan and I went to a local watering hole to pass the time and down our first beer.   Within 20 minutes or so the precious call from Furui-san came.  Atarashii-san seated us immediately upon returning.\n\nTsugu-chan quickly spied Megane-chan, an old acquaintance.  I thought \"Great, we'll get the inside scoop of the best fish\".  Unfortunately, despite being happy to see Tsugu-chan again, Megane-chan was only the busboy and didn't have the skinny for us.  :(    It would have been useful as the menu of special fish had at least 10 entries and insider knowledge to navigate could have been handy.  Nonetheless, Tsugu-chan and I quickly settled on the following:\n\nAppetizer - Spoonful of Happiness\nSashimi    - Hirame (or was it Hamachi?!) and Engawa\nNigiri         - Kuro Dai (Black Snapper, if I translated correctly)\n                   - Gindaro (Black Cod)\n                   - Akamutsu (Red something, snapper like, but not Tai)\nVeggies    - Goma Ae (Spinach with Sesame)\nMaki          - California Roll\nBeer          - Sapporo\n\nThe Spoonful of Happiness was actually two spoons and a jigger of sake.  One spoon contained Uni (Sea Urchin) with Quail Egg and the other Ankimo (Monkfish Liver, tastes kind of like Foie Gras) with a dab of a white fish (don't remember which one).  Although both of us really like Ankimo, Tsugu-chan selected the Uni Spoon and I had the Ankimo.  It was tasty, maybe 3.5/5, but not as good as the name.  After a swig of sake that 3.5 turned into a 4.  :)\n\nThe sashimi and nigiri, however, did not disappoint at all.  The sashimi was sliced very thin, reminiscent of carpaccio.  It came with ponzu as a dipping sauce and some minced green onion.  It was very good and I got to eat most of it as Tsugu-chan started talking to Megane-chan again.  :)    The nigiri arrive quickly after the sashimi was consumed.  The arrival of the nigiri ignited a debate between Tsugu-chan and I about \"fingers v chopsticks\".  I'm a finger-method man.  Tsugu-chan said that's correct at the sushi counter, but at a table chopsticks are OK.    I still think Tsugu-chan just didn't want to lose the debate!  :o  In any case, what really matters is that in all cases the fish was extremely fresh and the rice was well-made (although I still think Sushi on North Beach has the best shari [thanks to Noboo's reviews, I've learned a new word]). \n\nThe goma-ae and california roll were quality dishes, but nothing to write home about.

The interior has a nice understated, minimalist decor. \n\nWhat really irked me (and my friend) is the price we ended up paying at the end of our Omakase. After tax and tip our bill was over $200. I have shelled out close to $100 for sushi on several occasions but those in the past were all worth it.  Definitely NOT this time. \n\nSo tell me.

We thought it would be extremely overpriced. We also are more neat but casual dressers and thought we had to dress up for this place. So we were saving it for a special occasion. To our surprise, most of the sushi prices were no higher than most decent Japanese sushi restaurants. The early bird only reduced items by a dollar so it was not a big deal maybe unless you drink. We did not look at the drink menu b/c we don't drink alcohol. We were disappointed by the calamari $9... not cripsy and the dipping sauce was not quite there. Did not like the texture... cornmeal? The Gozzilla Tofu was nice and crisp but the miso sauce missed some cubes resulting in some \"very salty\" cubes and some kind of tasteless. The beef tataki was tough... I'm ok  with a few less pieces of meat and instead, a better grade as served at Izakaya Sozai. The hand rolls were fresh but didn't wow us. Our avocados did not overflow like in the photos. The combo sushi was ok. The Azteca  Roll didn't do a thing for us. It didn't have a bite. It tasted like a warm california roll with a slightly fishy white fish on top and decorated w/ a ring of tasteless Jalapeno. No tea offered because when we sat down we asked for water? \nWhat really annoyed us, was the waitresses. Please don't get me wrong. There were more than enough wait staff and the ladies were very polite and sweet. But...One after another would grab the serving dishes away while we were still chomping on our rolls, etc. After the 3rd time, I was determined to eat a bite of the ginger but away it went while I had 2 hands busy with my hand roll. 6 hand rolls, 1 combo sushi, 1 azteca roll and I only got one bite of the ginger. My kids got none.\nThis is a nice, clean Japanese restaurant. It is in the cold foggy Sunset where I live and work. As we sat there, we yearned for a bowl of ramen or donburi to go with the sushi. Ochauke? Maybe it was my mistake, we should have asked for some hot tea. Sushi taste much better w/ hot tea.\nWe are spoiled by very good sushi. We've spent 5 summers in Japan. We love going over to Berkeley to Kirala at least once a month. We are used to paying extra for the yummy sushi. Koo was not bad, decent, just not great. Total bill w/ tax and tip $108.00 for 3 for an average meal. We might go back but my sushi crazy sons showed no excitement during the meal. I would not avoid it. It can be a very nice cozy place to have a quiet decent dinner. Order the hot tea, miso soup. Rotating the tables by the window so all can gaze out might help.

These shrimp heads were under fried and didn't have the outer shell of the head. They were just ugly which is not acceptable!  It's like they took off that shell and then fried the shrimp.    One was a normal size and the other one came extremely small.  As for the Oysters they were very good and the sauce on top was excellent but one of the four oysters was extremely small in size and did not look quite fresh. I also felt the Uni was not as fresh as I have eaten in other places.  As for the cooked items, I did enjoy them more than the sushi, the fried tofu topped with a nice miso sauce.  \n\nThe service was mediocre, for a small restaurant I felt they could done a bit better.  I went away a little hungry and ready for dessert....we almost went to Bi-Rite but  somehow ended up at Marco Polo...:)) which is NEVER a disappointment!\n\nMaybe I didn't drink enough sake to enjoy the meal?  I doubt I would return here.  I rather to go to HOSHI's in Santa Clara, which is currently my favorite sushi restaurant in the Bay Area for now.  \n\nOh the worst part was that I RAVED to my friend about this place and she kept telling me too look around, do you see any Japanese business men or even Japanese people here?....I couldn't say yes because there weren't any...", "author": "Mel S."}

I wanted to try almost everything but ended up with Hotaru Ika (tiny whole squids, yay, squid guts in the head! They taste better than it sounds), the Toro Trio (Blue fin tuna, Albacore, and Yellowtail bellies, oh melty melty goodness), and the Gindara nigiri (Black Cod sushi... okay, could have picked another fish). My friend and I split a Miso Marinated Black Cod, which just melted in my mouth and the marinade was super yum. You can never go wrong with miso marinated softy buttery fish! I was just swishing the fish between my tongue and the roof of my mouth instead of chewing it, and it was heavenly!\n\nAt last, I realized my wallet couldn't take it anymore, but I was still itching to eat something. Usually I end my sushi outings with an iku-tama/ikura with uzura (salmon roe with raw quail egg) orgasm in my mouth, but my friend suggested trying the Spoonful of Happiness, since it had the raw quail egg, and I agreed, just to see what it was all about. \n\nSo you actually get TWO spoons of happiness, yay! The first one was monkfish wrapped in white fish, this one had a bit of a kick, and the second one had the quail egg... and uni.\n\nI don't particularly like uni, and I had neglected to notice that uni was served in the spoons of happiness, but thankfully, it was only on one spoon! And I got to wash it all down with the sake. But the aftertaste of uni was still there, wah! So if you like uni, the second spoon of happiness will most definitely be for you. \n\nAnyway, Koo is rather pricey, but it's worth it and it seems like there would be something new the next time. I'm coming back to try the Best Roll, and whatever is on \"Catch of the Day!\"", "author": "Cat D."}

Yes!  That's 3 stars right there.  The next star goes to freshness of the sashimi.  The last star goes to the great service.   \n\nFor starter, the spoon full of happiness is yummmmy (if you like uni)!You can't really share this dish though.  You need to have it all for yourself.  The house mixed green salad is good and pretty big, so you can share this.  The Hamachi Kama is good for sharing too if you like grilled fish.\n\nThey have daily specials of sashimi from different parts of the world, which is not always on the menu.  Those are guaranteed to be fresh.   Any sashimi is fresh, we've been there many times and have never been disappointed.  The spicy tuna roll is good because it's not like most places where you feel like you're just eating hot sauce.  You can actually taste the fish and a bit of spiciness to it.  We love the Azteca roll and I'm generally not a big roll fan.  I generally like to stick with the sashimi.  \n\nFor dessert, try the Mt. Fuji and get a scoop of green tea gelato with that.  The portion isn't huge and won't put you over the top.  \n\nOh and if you like beer try the black Asahi.  This was the first time we had it and we love it.  It's a dark beer but very smooth and not too heavy or bitter.  I'm not a beer drinker and I like it alot.

The fried calamari is made from smaller squid, not the big ones, they're crisp, tasty, and lasts the whole dinner.\n\nWe had two rolls and two other dishes (3-4 piece nigiri and sashimi stuff) and it cost us $68 total.

The Best Roll (asparagus tempura and avocado wrapped in thinly sliced salmon and lemon) really lives up to it's name--it's amazing. Tart and fresh and delish. I'm not usually a fan of sake sushi, but the lemon makes it totally doable for me. I was also pleasantly surprised by the shrimp tempura roll...it has asparagus in it, which (incredibly) mimics the texture of macadamia nuts--which are FANTASTIC in sushi (not sure why more places don't use them). The spciy tuna roll was also among the best that I've had--could've been a tad spicier IMHO, but the tuna was incredibly fresh and flavorful. Also had a cal roll, which was perfect in that it was made with real crab and minimal mayo.\n\nI don't eat a lot of raw fish, and I don't like eel or eel sauce (which is why I didn't fall in love with Red Box--it seems to focus a lot on eel), so I'm hard pressed to find a place with a really great selection and variety, yet I'm still picky about  quality, flavor, and especially texture.

I'll have to admit that the sushi was good, but it was nothing extraordinary. \n\nWhat I really didn't like was the service. The maitre'd seated and gave us menus when we walked in. Ok, so far, so good. We quickly decided what we wanted to eat, and then waited for our waitress.....and waited and waited. She never bothered to come and greet us or ask what we'd like to drink until we waved her down. And the restaurant wasn't even busy at this time!! \n\nWe asked our waitress if Koo offers geoduck clam sashimi. I know it's called something different in Japanese, but we didn't know the term. Instead of trying to help us figure it out, our waitress said (in a curt tone): \"What do you want?? I do not know what you're talking about.\" She was a pretentious you-know-what. \n\nThe fun didn't stop there. After we placed our order, we waited about 25 minutes before our first dish came. It was 12 slices of sashimi - how long does it take to cut pieces of fish?! Our second and third dish arrived 5-10 minutes after that, which isn't bad, but we were already irritated.\n\nOverall: Good sushi, bad service. For these prices, I'd rather go to Taraval Okazu Ya, a great sushi place in the Sunset that is cheaper and has better service.", "author": "Cee J."}

Koo is probably on my list of top 5 japanese restaurants I have tried in SF.\n\nRecommendations: \nI started with the Spoonfuls of happiness. Definitely recommended. Savory earthy flavors of the ponzu and truffle oil were balanced by the freshness of the uni. Topping off the spoon was a quail egg, adding a rich velvety texture. \n\nThe grilled octopus is absolutely amazing. Perfectly seasoned and cooked, the octopus manages to retain a firm texture, without a hint of rubberiness that sometimes happens with such a robust cooking method. We went through the first plate of it so quickly, we had to order a second. \n\nIn addition to the spoonfuls, we also ordered the miso glazed cod, which was good, though not spectacular.\n\nWe ordered most of our sushi based on what was on their fresh catch menu.

After seeing the horrible reviews on them I decided I probably didn't want to spend my money there.\nOne place I have wanted to try was Koo. I love Ariake but lately it seems like I've been there so much lately I just felt like I wanted to try a new place. \n\nThe parking isn't very abundant but we were able to find some within about 10 minutes of circling the block. We walk in and have a seat at the sushi bar and get to looking at the menus and specials.\n\n--First things first was the alcohol. Nice sake selection and the koshikari echigo has always been one of my favorite beers. I ordered some daiginjyo and waited for the party to start!  The coolest thing I thought was the fact that they serve your sake In a tall shot glass situated in a little box. For some reason I find this too cool. The only other place I can remember  being served sake like this was In New York.   \n--The first thing I had was the dynamite King crab hand  roll which was baked and served warm, I'm so glad I got the last 2 orders because it was very good.  \n--We then had the  Tempura hamachi which was served crispy and warm as should be expected.\n--Another dish was the sweet shrimp, which was good but the real treat was the fried head. I gotta admit I felt bad about eating the head and eyeballs but it  was sooo good. Probably the best part of the dish.\n--The albacore tataki was very good as well but seemed to have a bit  too much cilantro which overpowered the fish.\n--We tried the toro which was a bit steep but not bad. One roll was actually a bit bigger than the other.  I think I'd rather have spent the $16 on another menu item but that's my own problem so I  cant complain. \n--Then came the hamachi Kama which was excellent. I even asked the chef if there was anything else they had that was similar  and he told me they did but it wasn't on the menu. I believe he said it was tai or in other words seabream. It too was very tasty and seemed a little more lean than the hamachi Kama. Still one of the better fishes I've  had the pleasure of tasting. \n --For dessert we had  the mt Fuji which was good but seemed like the chocolate part should have been served warm which it wasn't.\n\nAll in all I was very impressed with the service and food here. It was about 2x what I would typically spend on sushi but no complaints on my end. It doesn't hurt that the chefs answered all my questions about the daily specials  and made some excellent recommendations. The dynamite king crab roll and hamachi Kama alone are enough for me to go back.", "author": "Cesar H."}

If you are a first-timer, apparently you are not allowed to sit at the bar.  In addition, they encourage you to follow their version of the \"omakase\" which includes a choice of sashimi plate or \"spoonful of happiness\" followed by a mix of nigiri and cooked dishes.  \n\nA spoonful of happiness it was indeed.  \n\nThe spoonful of happiness is two spoons served side by side, one of ankimo and the other of uni with quail egg.  They are heaven.  We had the sashimi plate as well and while a lot of the fish was relatively ordinary, the yellowtail belly stood out.  Very fat, very tasty.  \n\nThe most unique dish we had was the two jack fish that the chef had taken all the meat off of and served to us sashimi-style over a bed of ice.  Then the bones themselves were deep fried.  This was my favorite dish of the night and I would gladly return just to have this.  Maybe I'm just a sucker for deep-fried fish bones.  \n\nThe next dish was a small plate of baby shrimp also deep fried such that you could eat the shell.  This was part of the \"catch of the day.\"  We joked that these were the shrimps that Chinese people would probably throw away or not eat since they are so small but boy were they tasted.  The chef definitely knows what he is doing.  \n\nThe last thing we tried was a couple of hot dishes served together - eggplant, tofu and a hot pepper stuffed with yellowtail.  None of these items really stood out and if I had a choice, I would probably not order them again.

We were sitting right in front of the sushi chef, I was hoping that they would have served us a belly cut and saved the cuts we got for some sushi combo order.\nWe also ordered some hot food, i thought the miso eggplant was nice. But my wife didn't like it as much as i did. We also had the jalapeno popper stuffed with hamachi. It was baked in mayo and kinda tasted like the tiny lobster you'd get when you go to a Chinese buffet\nOverall the food @ Koo is better than your regular sushi place, i'd try Koo a couple more times when i'm in the Sunset", "author": "Yummy P."}

I typically only order rolls to fill up after I've gone through my sashimi and nigiri orders, but their rolls are quite delicious.  \n\nIt would be a pretty crappy review if I didn't find something to complain about.  The bathroom really sucks.  They only got one, and it's dual use. And the sink is separate from the toilet.  As somebody who drinks a lot, this really sucks when the place is packed. I hate waiting, even more so when it's to use the bathroom.  Thankfully, I haven't encountered any issues yet.\n\nOverall I love this place.  It's the best Japanese restaurant near where I live.

This aint your run of the mill Korean owned sushi house (no offense to my Korean friends), it is definitely Japanese. \n\nThe night we went, all of us chose 2 specialty rolls each.

Everything we had was good, and it was cool that they offered wild salmon nigiri in addition to the usual farmed kind. I enjoyed the goma ae (a la the version served at Tokyo Go-Go, which is apparently where one of the chefs used to work) and the broiled eggplant.

Since I didn't go into much detail last time, I will elaborate now.  The tartare has the perfect balance of fresh tuna and salmon, avocado/guacamole, sesame oil, seaweed salad, and is paired with crispy light shrimp chips.  The Dynamite hand roll is simple with warm and juicy baked scallops accompanied by a dollop of wasabi tobiko.  You will need two or more of these.

The prices are really reasonable for sushi (try the $5 baked scallops hand roll) and the desserts are only $4 - I highly recommend the Yuzu Cheesecake; it's the perfect balance between sweet and tart.

It's interesting to eat and tastes pretty great. It's TWO spoons that consist of the following: \n\nSpoonful of Uni, Quail Egg, Tobiko, Ponzu & Ankimo wrapped with whitefish, Truffle-Oil &  a shot of chilled Sake.\n\nThe others at the table liked the Ankimo better than the Uni and Quail Egg spoon, but I thought they were both great.. I'm not one to talk about fresh ingredients because I do not have a touchstone to compare them to, but the texture and taste agreed with my primarily vegetarian taste buds. \n\nThe veggie combo is enough for one - a veggie tempura roll, a veggie roll and veggie nigiri - asparagus, eggplant and inari. The quantity is just right, two pieces of each roll and the additional nigiri makes for a good meal.\n\nThe texture of the wrap was incredible, not chewy and hard to bite into like other rolls, where your mouth is so full you're covering it with your hand to not look like a fat ass. The vegetables were cooked and seasoned to perfection. The quantity of wasabi is slightly less than a dragon-mouth like me would ideally desire, but my friend obliged and gave me hers. \n\nThe plum sake was great too! They have a lot of different types of sake, must try all if/when possible. \n\nThe server was a little odd, but they were totally cool about splitting the check in four cards. Most places give you crap about that, but not this one! Atmosphere was casual. We made reservations, but didn't need to, they had a few tables open (3 I think).

I've passed by this place a few times and thought it looked like a cute and cozy place and finally had a chance to try it. A lot of Yelp reviews raved about Spoonful of Happiness and it also seemed like their signature dish, and in fact I've never seen anything like that at other Japanese restaurants in the city so we ordered that. It's came with two spoons and a shot of chilled sake - one has whitefish wrapped around monk fish liver and the other one has uni with a quail egg. It's $10 for two spoons of seafood that you can eat in two bites so at first I thought they were a bit pricey, but it wasn't until I tried them that I realized they were quite heavenly! I was instructed to take half shot, then eat the lighter spoon first and then finish the rest of the shot before eating the second and heavier tasting spoon. The ingredients were super fresh and tender. The sake helped clear any aftertaste you have in your mouth between spoons and even the sake was quality - it was smooth and didn't burn unlike some cheaper sake I had. Was never a HUGE fan of fish livers and uni but because the ingredients complemented each other very well along with the right sauces and sake, my tummy was happy afterwards (hence the name!)\n\nOther things we ordered:\n\nAzteca roll - really one of the best rolls I've ever had! It has crab,avocado, gobo and cucumber wrapped in white fish, topped w/ a thin slice of jalepeno , spicy mayo, tobiko & ponzu then lightly baked. I must give the chef mad props for understanding how to complement the ingredients. The aroma of the lighter ingredients (avocado, cucumber) brought out the flavor in the fish while the jalepeno and spicy mayo added a kick to the overall taste. Loved it!\n\nMiso Black Cod - Another dish strongly recommend by the house.  The huge piece of cod was basked in a fish-based miso soup with bak-choy and tofu. The fish was cooked so well that it fell right off the fish bones (so you wouldn't have to worry about choking on the fish bones) and the meat itself melted in your mouth. It was DELICIOUS and I felt healthy eating it at the same time. \n\nDidn't get a chance to try other raw fish they have although the three items I tried already made me a fan!

We had reservations for 7:30 and quickly found parking across the street.  The waitress seated us in a little corner by the window, away from the loud crowd and the lights were dim with candles lit on every table, which gave it a nice romantic feel; too bad that vibe was drowned out by how totally loud this place was. They almost lost a star for that. Boo.\n\nBut different story when the food came, we ordered:\n\nGodzilla Tofu: They're so good! I wish I had more, but they're starters so the portions are small.  The garlic mayo dipping sauce was great!\n\nStuffed Jalapeno: This, I also wished I had more of, but once again, it's another starter that I ordered.  All I can say is, BIGGER PORTIONS PLEASE. They're yummy!\n\nAzteca Roll: I popped one of these in my mouth and it instantly made my taste buds happy.  It's a cooked roll with crab, avocado, some kind of fish on top, a piece of jalapeno and some sauce that had a light spice to it. Yum. My boyfriend's fave.\n\nBest Roll: This one was my fave; it was prepared nicely, the fish was cold and tasted fresh.  This roll has a refreshing clean taste to it and i LOVED it.\n\nDragon Roll: I am a lover of the Dragon Roll, so we had to get it.  The tempura had a crunchy batter the shrimp was delicious, but my two favorites of the night had to be the Best roll and Azteca roll.\n\nMt. Fuji: We ended out night with this chocolate cake dessert with a sccop of green tea ice cream. The presentation of this dish was so pretty, it really looked like Mt. Fuji! There was white sugar powdered sprinkled on top with the green tea ice cream on the side.\n\nThe bill was about $78, kind of pricey, but totally worth it!

The food tasted decent, but the variety of adventurous offerings was amazing.  Apart from the typical sushi offerings (i.e. Dragon and rainbow rolls, California rolls, salmon sashimi, etc.), Koo also serves up exotic fresh catch sashimi.  \n\nMy first impression was good; the place seemed trendy and upscale.  The decorations were classy and the waiters were friendly.  We went pretty early and since there were many tables available, we were surprised they asked if we had a reservation.  But it wasn't without warrant, as by the time we were finished with dinner the entire restaurant was full.\n\nFor our appetizers, we decided to be experimental and started with Mexican black sea bass nigiri and deep sea red snapper.  It was definitely obvious that this fish was fresh, and not all fishy like some places (I won't name any names).\n\nWe also had some shrimp dumplings which were alright.  The best thing about that dish was the presentation, with colorful garnish and sauce artfully sprawled on the plate.\n\nFor our main entre we ordered a couple different rolls: Dragon, Flying Kamikaze, and U2.  They were all great.  The ingredients tasted of utmost quality and the presentation was fantastic.  The waiters were also very attentive and helpful.  Sometimes when I order various rolls, I don't know which is which?  But when the waiters at Koo served our plate of sushi they walked us through each roll and told us the names of each one. \n\nWe had a great time Koo; it was a wonderful place to have a date.  They only downside is that the prices are a little steep.  The rolls will run you nearly $15 each, our dinner was $75.  But then again, it's an upscale restaurant and you're paying not only for the quality of food, but also for the atmosphere and good service.

Decent, meaning the freshness of the fish is inconsistent and the prices are too high for the quality.  But, in past visits I felt it was an enjoyable-enough experience to come back.  We went there last Thursday for dinner, and there was an obviously newish host working.  He took a bit too long to greet us and then seemed confused about where to seat us (we had a reservation).  Before ordering, I asked the waitress for recommendations on rolls, since I usually order nigiri or sashimi.  She pointed out to me the most popular, meaning most ordered, rolls on the menu, which are the rolls including fried things/tempura, or the more Americanized rolls.  Being raised with Japanese culture, I was disappointed by her recommendations.  We enjoyed our decent meal though, and were paying our check and finishing off our second bottle of sake.  Then, the host came up to us and said something to the effect of, \"I have another reservation waiting for this table.  I'm not asking you to leave, but just consider that.\"  Mind you, we had not taken our sweet time with this meal, in fact, we were on our way to an event so were aware of being timely and our total time in the restaurant was still under one hour.  What bothered me more though, was that we were seated next to an older, more Caucasian couple who had been there long before we had arrived by the looks of where they were in their courses when we sat down, and nothing was said to them by the host.  I felt discriminated against, which is really unacceptable especially at a place with such high-end prices (we spent over $100) and attitude.  I won't be going back.", "author": "Stephanie S."}

Definitely more of a hip scene/rolls type place . . . but I was pleasantly surprised at the quality and precision of the fish presented.  \n\nMy dining party loved the rolls, especially the kamikaze . . . and the \"caterpillar\" roll they made to order for them.  I'm more of a sushi/nigiri fiend and I was ecstatic with the feel and especially the taste of the toro, saba, sake, hamachi, suzuki.  Just heaven.\n\nWe stumbled in here to meet some friends on a Friday night.  Though it wasn't too late - 8 - it felt like they had already turned their tables a few times.  You know that look of relief of a hostess, followed by a relaxed couple of servers . . . we were seated right away.  Nothing to complain about regarding service; it was prompt.\n\nStrange sake \"tasting notes\" . . . but good sake nonetheless, at fair prices after the restaurant markup.  \n\nAgain, there isn't much in Colorado that prepared me for such good fish, but over-nighted sushi in Fort Collins shouldn't be far off from days-old fish in San Fran.  This obviously wasn't days-old fish, but I can't comment on its quality relative to the market in SF.\n\nThe notorious \"spoonful\" seemed like more of a novelty than the purported cornerstone of their menu.

The sushi we ordered, Hotate Nigiri, Fresh Albacore nigiri, and Rock n' Roll, were all good as well. \n\nThe service was efficient and well paced.

It began to fill up pretty quickly and it was a Tuesday night, well, i think this place only seats 50 people or something. \n\nWe started with the Bamboo Tower salad- sounded substantial and more just seaweed or greens with a Japanese dressing- wow- was really fresh- strips of fish, salad, some kind of fish jam (i cant describe it any other way, but it melted quickly and left a light fish taste- YUM) with a light ponzu dressing...ahhhh am salivating- everything but the greens are stuffed into a bamboo (hence the tower) then the server removes the bamboo and lets the filling fall onto the greens..... definitely a treat and very flavourful.. wanted more... \n\nWe ordered the black cod and barracuda nigiri- mild and the slices of fish were pressed very firmly onto the rice, so you could dip the fish into the soy sauce without it all falling apart. Wow- skill. \n\nAzteca Roll was my fave out of the sushi we ordered. With thin slices of jalapeno gave it the perfect crunch and was not over powering. Ever so lightly baked, it was like the fish was kissed by a touch of heat, the mayo was perfect- kept everything moist, didnt need dip for the rolls as there was so much flavour..... ahhh! Over heard a few other people order the Best roll, so thought we would join the club- asparagus tempura which was not greasy and kept crunchy throughout, with salmon and paper thin lemon slices draped on the top. Again- no dip needed- it was moist enough to carry its own but next to the Azteca, it was a strong second place \n\nAlthough it was full by the time we had settled in, the atmosphere was quiet intimate with the candles on every table and we could talk easily without having to raise our voices. The servers were friendly and made sure our tea cups were full. Surprised that they didn't offer desert, especially reading here on Yelp that there was black sesame mousse. I would have stayed for that! \n\nI wouldn't come here every other week cos its a little out of the way and it is a little pricey, but definitely would return with people from out of town, as this place is pretty exceptional.

This may, just may have taken over my favorite Japanese spot in town.  \n\nI should put the caveat in here perhaps it wasn't fair that I'm rating this place so high since I was with a Japanese girl who essentially ordered everything for us and suggested some new things I haven't had elsewhere.  I went to dinner here last Sat. in a group of four and it was surprisingly not too crowded.  No reservations and we waited like 10 min. max.  \n\nSpoonful of Happiness: Yes, for first timers (aka me) the ingredients sound adventurous, but realize this what they are known for!  Read other reviews for a full description, I had the quail egg/uni spoon and all I can say is that it was truffle oil heaven.\n\nBlack Cod Miso: I liked the light sauce they served it in, and the fish tasted actually very smooth and quite buttery.  While good, I felt like might have had it better at places like Yuzu.  \n\nAzteca/Dragon/California rolls: The rolls, IMHO are pretty outstanding here.  The Dragon/California I would say is high quality but nothing spectacular.  I highly recommend trying the Azteca.  They top this roll with a thin slice of jalapeno and while I'm not usually a fan of jalapeno, this provided a nice kick for the roll without it being too overbearing on the taste. \n\nPrice is about the same if not a little cheaper than other sushi places in town.  We paid ~$25/person for all the above, some additional appetizers, and beers", "author": "Ken S."}

With every new dish that was presented, a server came and quickly clear the last plates.\n* Very accommodating as a group came in and left their luggage by the door where we put our jackets and bag. \n* Our hot tea was always refilled immediately.\n* We sat right in the middle, in front of Kiyoshi (owner).\n* He was polite, soft spoken and funny:) I liked him! Very sweet man who knows how to run a business and does it extremely well.\n* As we finished our meal, a server dropped our plates and broke some next to us and apologized profusely. It was no biggie since accidents do happen:)\n\nFood:\n* Exotic, fresh and delicious!!\n* Sashimi melted in my mouth, spiced with a bit of fresh wasabi.\n* Think of all the nigiri you see at a restaurant -- yea, we didn't have that. We ate everything he had that night except your regular nigiri (maguro, sake, hamachi, tobiko, etc) and it was all exceptional and beyond.\n  - oh toro: fatty and succulent\n  - kamasu (barracuda): A slight smokey taste from the skin but it was very tasty and fresh\n  - blue shrimp (raw): An interesting texture; I had a hard time getting my piece off the tail :) A slight shrimp flavor - good! Bf had another order.\n  - baigai (sea snails) in a broth: 3 pieces of baigai, which were all very chewy but not overpowering. Subtle flavors with a rich, tasty broth.\n  - tobiuo (flying fish - Not the eggs): If you think the eggs taste good, you should try the flying fish. I had 2 :)\n  - tombo (albacore tuna from Kona - seared): delicious and fun to watch him sear it right in front of us!\n  - sayori (needlefish): Slight texture but still melted in my mouth.\n  - Sawara (spanish mackerel): I am not a fan of mackerel, though I still eat it from time to time. This one tasted like nothing I have ever tried. Slight flavor but delicious!\n  - Plate of grilled Japanese eggplant, hamachi stuffed jalapeno and tuna tartare \"taco\": SO GOOD. PERIOD.\n  - Spoonful of Happiness: DIVINE!! 2 spoons of HeavenInYourFreakinMouth accompanied by a shot of cold sake. We each had another (although we could have asked for 10 more!!).\n* Bf finished a hot sake. The cold sake shots were smoooth!\n\nOur bill was close to $200 (without tip) but worth every penny of it.\n\nTips:\n- Another couple ordered omakase next to us and got a totally different menu but they had a much more precise taste. They will cater to whatever your preferences are.\n- Parking is so hard to find so come a bit early.\n- They close at 10:30 on Fridays but last call is at 10.\n- He has other restaurants in SF (Ace Wasabi/Tokyo A GoGo) but Koo is more for nigiri/sashimi (since they have the best selection).\n- They have a dessert menu and one of them changes every month!! This month was creme brulee:)\n- I can't comment on the taste of the rolls but they all looked delicious!!\n\nWe had the best time at Koo! It's definitely now our favorite sushi place:) When we were talking to Kiyoshi, he said he enjoys making people happy with his food and does so without judging you, because he knows that each person has their own specific tastes.

Encouraged by the great reviews on Yelp, we finally made it in tonight.\nI can only assume that we made it in on an off night...This place was HORRIBLE. For those that know me, I am an overwhelmingly positive person, prone to rate everything as \"the best....ever\" that said, there was NOTHING positive about the sushi at Koo. It was easily the worst, oldest and least cared about fish I have encountered since my last visit to Long John Silver's in '84. The service was very friendly, but that actually made it worse. They had to know how bad their product was. It was like someone smiling in your face while they peed into your cola.\nI cannot imagine that anyone who appreciates sushi could give this place a decent review. Unless,again, we just caught them on a REALLY bad night. Which is possible as our chef  looked embarrassed as he put each course in front of us....And he should have been.\nThe key to any sushi place is the fish, and the bottom line is that Koo's fish was old and clearly had been frozen for way too long. If they cared about their customers at all, they would have done the honorable thing and thrown their last shipment out.\nThey should be ashamed of what they are selling.

In one spoon: uni, quail egg, tobiko with ponzu sauce.  In another: ankimo wrapped with whitefish and truffle oil.  This delightful appetizer comes with a shot of sake - you are suppose to have one spoonful, take in some of the sake, and do the same for the second spoonful.  The sake helps to clean your palate after each spoonful so you could fully enjoy each of the flavors.  Oh so heavenly!  \n      Spoonful of happiness is like foreplay.  I understand why the chefs thought it would be perfect as an appetizer, but I feel it could very well be something you could end the night with too. It's not just wam bam, thank you ma'm.  Hence, my 5 days of spooning  :)  \n \nUni Nigiri \nWe originally had 2 orders, but we added an extra order so that we each could have an order of uni to ourselves.  If you've never had uni before or had one bad tasting of uni and want to give it a second chance....come here, this is what uni should taste like.  After Live Sushi, I really needed this to re-affirm my love for uni.  Uni love rekindled.  \n\nHottegai scallops from Japan\nUnlike some of the previous scallops I've had, this one does not smell, at all.  It's big, thick, delicious and most importantly fresh!\n\nHamachi sashimi \nHamachi is my favorite fish.  I order it 90% of the time.  Sashimi style/over rice.  It never fails to satisfy my tummy.  Our hamachi is clearly sashimi grade, there is no fishy scent whatsoever, and when you push on it, it's got a firm bounce.  Just like men, I hate mushy - I always send it back.    \n\nMirugai (local geoduck)\nIt's quite easy to prepare mirugai in the comforts of your own home, sashimi or lightly stir fried.  I haven't had it in a while, but my love for mirugai is still going strong! \n\nAzteca roll\nThis (baked) roll is wrapped a little loose, but the flavors....oh my god....the inside is filled with crab, avocado, gobo and cucumber wrapped in white fish....the outside is topped with a thinly slice of jalapeno with spicy mayo and tobiko.  It's the first time a roll just melts in my mouth.  YUMmmm....    \n\nMiso marinated black cod\nLight and buttery, over a bed of bok choy and fried tofu.  Miso love this dish!  \n\nMt. Fuji\nYou have to make sure you leave room for dessert!  If you are absolutely full and just thinking of sharing ONE dessert, this would be IT.  This chocolate cake stuffed with white chocolate mouse might be a little rich for some but I absolutely loved it.  An order of ginger gelato was the perfect complement to this dessert, it came with homebaked cookies.    \n\n(The 8 items above are my favorites of the night, the ones listed below weren't too bad, but I would rather save the room to try something new next time.)\n\nAnkimo\nEver since I've had ankimo at Kabuto, I've compared every ankimo dish to that.  The one here is not seared - it is chopped up into little mini squares and spread on top of rice, wrapped with seaweed.  Not bad, but not what I was hoping for.  \n\nFlyfish from japan\nI remember seeing a whole school of this on my Mexican Riviera cruise, and have always wondered what flyfish tasted like.  It reminds me of red snapper except the meat is a little finer.\n\nGodzilla tofu\nI'm 50/50 about this dish.  The menu said it is crispy tofu with spicy garlic mayo.  It looks crispy, but once you bite into it, it's a little chewy on the outside and silky soft on the inside.  I like the inside more than the outside.  Personality is more important than looks.\n\nStuffed grilled jalapeno\nI like my grilled stuff, but this one was a little bit too charred for my taste.  It gave me an instant pimple in my throat but it did not deter me from stuffing my face for the remainder of the night.  This is just grounded hamachi stuffed into a jalapeno, grilled, and you dip it with lime aioli.  Of all the dishes we had, I would say that this was my least favorite, and given the chance, I would probably not order it again.  \n\nGinger gelato\nI'm not a fan of ginger, but the gelato was good.  I wouldn't order this alone, but it was the perfect complement for our Mt. Fuji.    \n\nCheesecake\nMousse topped with some fruity jelly-like thing on top.  It was missing something, perhaps some lavendar/roasted sesame.  I only had two spoonfuls of it - it's quite forgettable.  \n\nWho needs a fork when you can spoon?

I've heard great things about this place but we usually don't feel like venturing to this side of the park.  Now I think I will be coming to the sunset side much more often.  \n\nWe came here late Friday night on a whim.  I had already eaten a little bit for dinner but was still hungry and had been craving some awesome nigiri for awhile.  When we walked, we were serendipitously seated in front of the owner at the sushi bar.  I had no idea until near the end of the meal that he was the owner.  He's a very unassuming and nice man and offered great advice on fish picks.  \n\nI ordered my usual favs of amaebi and hotate (a special one that was shipped fresh from hokkaido,) a blue shrimp nigiri I have never tried, the scrumptious uni from mendocino, a spider roll that had a huge crab in it, anago,  and Kiyoshi gave us a complimentary salmon sushi dish mixed w/ miso sauce and onions.  All were spectacular and a great value considering the price.  An order of amaebi or uni nigiri was $6.50.  I usually pay more for much lesser quality.  My girlfriend, who never will eat uni, tried it here and loved it.  If you're feeling like a roll, you must try the spider.  The crab IS HUGE, fried lightly so it's not too crispy, and the best I've ever had.  \n\nFrom speaking with Kiyoshi (http://www.sushikoo.com/pages/about.html), he's told me his career has progressed like my sushi eating habits.  I started off with rolls and then learned to appreciate the fresh fish and nigiri from my hawaiian friend who has great taste.  He also started his restaurant career as a partner as ace wasabi designing rolls for the menu, then moved on to start Tokyo Go-Go in the mission, and now he told me the focus of his latest restaurant here is on the fresh fish.  He has a daily menu that changes based on what good stuff his suppliers have and what he requests from Japan so you'll never get bored of the same old stuff here.  I wanted to try some other nigiri I had never seen anywhere else like the flying fish and matsuwasa (sp??) but we had to leave unfortunately.  He also recommended the \"spoonful of happiness\" if you're a a fresh fish fan.  I'm looking forward to a whole meal of happiness next time I'm here.\n  \nA couple of side notes:\n1) There were a good amount of Japanese dining here.  That's always a great indicator for me of any type of restaurant.\n2) I discovered he's friends and golf buddies with owners of some of my other fav japanese restaurants in the city - Oyaji and Tekka.  I guess the \"birds of a feather flock together\" saying applies with awesome sushi proprietors like it does with hot women.    ;P\n\nDSKO favs: EVERYTHING!!", "author": "Dik Shun K."}

I've heard good things about Koo, so chose this place not just for me to try a restaurant that is new to me, but also to chat with her in person.\n\nThe interior is the mix of traditional Japanese architecture and modern look, with black-painted wooden joists and purple ceiling.  The color purple was considered expensive because of dye technique until recently, so the use of that color in the architecture is modern.\n\nI'm glad that I reserved for two persons beforehand, because when the head waitress found my name on their reservation list, there were several groups at the 6 p.m. block.  Good that those without reservation still were able to sit down relatively quickly though.\n\nWe first ordered Bamboo Tower, Shichimi Crusted Tuna and Marinated Wild Mushroom, and Japanese Eggplant Dengaku.  Bamboo Tower is a salad with mizuna (similar to watercress?) and chopped seafood.  The taste was mild without the dressing overwhelming the fresh taste of mizuna.  Seafood adds nice contrast on texture and flavor.  Crusted tuna had a bit too much of shichimi (mixed spice), but raspberry sauce made the dish interesting.  Maybe I should've eaten with marinated mushroom to balance things out.  The eggplant was nice as expected.\n\nThen we started ordering sushi.  I ordered veggie combo because using only veggie to sushi appealed to me.  The tempura roll was ok, as I usually don't care too much about eating tempura and sushi rice together.  Asparagus, cucumber, and sweet potato were mild in taste.  My sister ate avocado nigiri, and commented it was nice as expected.  I told her that (correct me if I'm wrong) avocado was first used by a Japanese sushi chef in the US to substitute fatty tuna.  Asparagus nigiri was not bad at all, but eggplant one pleasantly surprised me with its smooth, viscous texture and grilled flavor.  Too bad that the eggplant had lots of oil to make that texture, because when I ordered the eggplant nigiri separately, the second one had me enough with oil.  More conventional nigiri's (kanpachi, ikura, tobiuo - flying fish, mackeral, and scallop) were all good, although not outstanding.  I was glad to eat tobiuo because of its subtle taste and bouncy texture.\n\nMy kid sister liked the dinner, but wanted to save some room for dessert.  So she ordered mochi ice while I ordered ice cream crape with fuji apple.  She commented and I agreed that the ice pretty much was from Trader Joe's or its equivalent.  The crape was nice, not too sweet.  For $4, they were in a very good value.\n\nBecause we ordered quite a bit of sushi, the bill was a little higher than I expected.  I kinda wished they had some rice dishes with fish on top so I could've satisfied my appetite that way and ordered fewer nigiri's.  Oh well, what mattered the most was that my sister and I chatted a lot to keep in touch while enjoying these dishes.  The relaxing and adequately lively (not too much so that we had to scream to each other) atmosphere even as the restaurant was filling up helped us converse comfortably.\n\nOne more thing to comment.  I cannot praise this restaurant enough to have that veggie sushi combo for curious minds like me to try something new, and vegetarians who cannot otherwise try good sushi except conventional and often boring cucumber and pickle rolls.  More traditional sushi places would discourage vegetarians, and given the diversity within SF, it's definitely nice to have at least one sushi place that serves veggie nigiri's and encourages vegetarians to come to Japanese restaurants.", "author": "Tak K."}

Living in the 9th and Irving area previously, I've walked by this japanese restaurant many times and have intended to check it out. The Inner Sunset certainly hasn't let me down in terms of japanese food - with Kazu on Irving as one of my favorite sushi joints in the city. But, I'm often skeptical about \"trendy\" looking japanese restaurants - convinced that the sushi will only come in roll form (and drizzled with tons of fancy dressings) and that it'll be far from \"authentic\" (so says this 4th generation Japanese girl :) ). That was my fear walking into Koo last Friday. But, let me break down why Koo is now one of my favorite japanese dining experiences in San Francisco.\n\n- Service was excellent and waitstaff are all nihonjin which seems to offer up added credibility.\n- Decor is simple, comfortable and elegant all at the same time. Perfect for a dinner date or a meal with the in-laws.\n- Food, oh the food, where do I start. If you aren't too picky, love variety and have $50 to splurge on your dinner, I'd highly recommend the omakase (chef's choice). We actually asked for the omakase but the waitress said that we needed to note that request when making reservations (which we actually made only an hour before). BUT, since we were 1st time customers, they could offer us a variety of dishes to try for $50. DONE. Here's my quick take on the 7 course meal:\n\n*Salmon sashimi with onions - delicate, delicious and makes me ready for more\n*Spoonful of Happiness - HOLY SH*T. The best spoon(s) full of happiness EVER - accompanied by a shot of sake. The TWO spoons include: 1) uni, raw quail egg and some yummy sauce 2) ankimo (monkfish liver) wrapped in sashimi of some sort with white truffle sauce. HEAVEN. I'd definitely order this off the menu.\n*Assorted sashimi (about 8 pieces) - Up with the best of SF. Fresh, nice slices. Hamachi was out of this world and the FRESH wasabi is ...wow...\n*Grilled foods - Grilled eggplant, jalapeno stuffed with hamachi, fried tofu ....eh, give me more spoonfuls of happiness!\n*Fish collar(s) - This is super delicate and tasty part of the fish. We had TWO collars one of which was black cod. DELICIOUS. Highly recommended if you can maneuver your way through fish bones with chop sticks.\n*And to finish: nigiri and rolls - Delicious, fresh and unique. But, by this time, I was stuffed!\n\nI am not sure if it was the assortment of yummy dishes, the awesome bottle of sake or if the spoonful of happiness had a secret ingredient...but Koo has it going on. Thank you for a wonderful experience, Koo, I will be back.", "author": "Deann M."}

I don't think the owner thought about associating reading of a review of the restaurant with going to the bathroom (I think they should rethink this one). There was no sink in the bathroom so I was confused and went back to my table without washing my hands (gimme a break here). The next time I used the bathroom I found the sink which was outside the toilet to the right (maybe the alcohol effected my ability to find the sink the first time). Anyways, they had an automated hand towel dispenser which I thought was going to eat my hand. It took me a while to figure out there was no lever so I put my hand on it trying to find a lever and all of a sudden it started to move. Scared the shit out me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-02", "description": "Alot of people seem to have a misconception of koo and koo sort of has a misconception of itself also.   I'll get straight to the point.  Similar to other sushi places in the city like Murasaki, Koo is known for their NIGIRI yes NIGIRI.  NOT ROLLS for you sushi amateurs.   Although they do have a select number of rolls (some of them being very delicious like the best roll) I highly recommend to order just nigiri sushi here.  It's also kind of obvious especially when they concenrate so hard to have a wide assortment of imported special nigiri selections every night.   Whenever I eat at koo I don't even look at their regular menu, I carefully browse through the paper print out which if you're lucky you'll have a selection at both rare and exotic deliciousnesses from the ocean.   For example have you ever had New Caledonia shrimp?  Compared to the lifeless rubbery white and pink striped crap you usually get at the average sushi bar these days Caledonia shrimp will either 1) make you a shrimp lover or 2) send you straight to an orgasm without foreplay.   But what about amaebi you ask?  Well Koo's New Caledonia shrimp has the subtle sweetness and umami flavors thats known with amaebi but with the impact thats probably 20 times stronger.   But enough about this one elusive taste that can only be found at koo for all i know of.   They usually have chu-toro on that print out too.  Chu-toro is like the A - grade piece of toro, (A is o-toro, and A+ comes from a miraculous piece of o-toro).   I have never seen O-toro at koo but their chu-toro can be hit or miss, sometimes its like an A, other times its like a B+ almost.   But those of you that have been eating at the average sushi bar in SF are most likely eating toro thats not even close to the freshness of koo's.   \n\nBut if you must get a roll.  I highly recommend the best roll.  A roll that has asparagus tempura and on top is salmon and on top of that is lemon.  Now let me describe how masterful this combination is.  The taste of asparagus actually goes quite well with the taste of oil, so the fact that its fried enhances its taste, but wait a second doesnt salmon have a pretty high fatty content why yes it does which bring harmony to the tempura asparagus and salmon.  But wait the taste of oil lingering in my mouth is gross, thats where the simplicity of a sliver of lemon comes in to bring a complex series of tastes that makes the best roll best.  \n\nKoo if you're reading this just continue to concentrate on your nigiri sushi and sashimi and let places like sushi house in oakland take care of the sushi roll whores.", "author": "Tomo S."}

This annoying girl on her date talked so loud the entire restaurant could hear her and I felt like she was yelling in my ear... but I digress.\n\nThe spider roll is a staple for me and the fried crab legs were the longest I've seen.  Usually I can eat a spider roll sushi end in one bite, I had to do it several.  It did come warm though, which I never had it warm.\n\nThe sushi chef was very nice and attentive. Even gave us a sample of a pickled salmon salad with jicama and celery, I never did figure out what it was called.\n\nI wish the servers was as attentive, I never did get a refill on my ice tea.\n\nMinus one star since i was craving udon soup that evening and they don't serve soup.", "author": "Mona B."}

Koo is now definitely on the top of my sushi list. i read lots of review about the \"spoonfull of happiness\", DAMN! that is the spoonful of happiness, the uni was fresh, and tasty, and the combination of that plus the sake made it even better. i didn't go all crazy with the raw food that night, just kind of try out all the different stuff on the menu.. \n\nmy bf order a duck salad and the chicken teriyaki with grill vegetable which were both  amazing. i have to say their food has a tint of fusion flavor overall. its not all that traditional. And i also had the salmon sashimi, which was very fresh!!  and the oyster, of course was super super fresh and tasty.. yumm\n\nthe only thing i wasn't very impress with was the tuna/salmon tartar.. not as flavor as i expect to be.. \n\ni have to give KOO a 5 star for the \"spoonful of happiness\". and the fresh sashimi.. for all you raw food lover out there.. gotta check it out this place!! plus the price is reasonable", "author": "Cindy C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-05-26", "description": "When it comes to a myriad of positive reviews of Koo, I will unfortunately have to be a dissenting voice.\n\nNeither the service or the food was great. I felt that the service was relatively inattentive; I had to signal to our server several times for a refill of our drinks and also take some of our plates away (started crowding up). \n\nThe spoonful of happiness had very delicate flavors that were complimentary but very short-lived. They went together relatively well with the chilled sake, but the texture was more of a highlight for me (than the flavor). \n\n- Kumamoto oysters were delicious, but were not cleaned thoroughly. Having sand in them was a definite turnoff\n\n- Bonito nigiri; I decided to try this first, and if I felt that the quality was up to par, I would have ordered the Toro. This was not the case. The chef tried, but unfortunately failed in integrating the flavors he intended. The quality of the fish was average based on the flavor and texture (based off the area that was not overwhelmed by the ginger/scallion). The ginger/scallion placed on top almost completely masked the flavor of the fish to the point of overwhelming the fish. I do not understand why the rice portion was drowning in ponzu; although the integrity of the rice was still left intact, I felt that it was going to fall apart in my fingers.\n\nI also ordered the fresh wasabi; it appeared fresh, but I wonder if it was freshly grated, or was this old \"fresh wasabi\". The reason being is that it seems to have lost a lot of the natural sweetness that fresh wasabi normally contains.\n\n- Next up, contrary to not really liking rolls, we ordered the dragon roll. I enjoyed the unagi, but otherwise found the tempura to be average (maybe excessively fried/starchy).\n\n- Entrees (2) : Beef Tataki and Miso Marinated Black Cod\n\nBeef Tataki: The beef was more tough than I would have wanted. The sauce on top was very salty, countered by the watercress. I thought the the watercress countered the saltiness, but the beef was not up to par (tough and the flavor was not great)\n\nMiso Marinated Black Cod: The fish was very tender, but the skin underneath was burnt. The flavors was just.... overwhelming and terrible. Although a good concept, that much salt totally ruined the dish. The broth it was bathed in felt like a solution of concentrated salt, and the fish just happened to swim in it. I enjoyed the part of the fish that was not submerged in the broth, but the rest was almost inedible. By the end of these two entrees, I had to drink so much water and tea just to remove the taste of salt from my mouth.\n\nBy then, I had just about enough. I paid the bill and left with a dessicated tongue from the salt. Very glad I did not get omakase. I do not feel that the fish was that fresh, the execution of the shared plates was terrible and I will not be coming here again.", "author": "John T."}

Get some of the day's catch, as they are super fresh and you can try something new and ask the waitress to point out favorites. We had the albacore tuna, spanish mackerel and halibut after her recommendations and they were all superfresh and yummy. And tried their eggplant and shittake sushi which were really good too, as a fish alternative. Finally, we had a couple of their rolls, the rock'n'roll and tokyo crunch which stole the show: Hamachi and unagi in one with bits of tempura flakes that makes it crunchy! \nWe washed the lovely flavors down with a sapporo and a delicious aromatic flowery sake. Easy on the sake though, it gets you drunk without realising...\nTheir desserts are suprisingly good for a Japanese restaurant.

While I was a visiting student at UCSF, I was looking for a sushi place to eat nearby and in the process I stumbled upon sushi Koo. After my first visit which did not go so well because one of the waitresses was quite mean to us when we just showed up without any reservation, we were turned away with a cold shoulder. I don't know if it was because English was not her native language or what, but we were not so impressed being treated poorly like that. \n\nEven though the first experience did not go so well, I have dicided to give this place another try simply because the restaurant is always crowded (compared to the other sushi restaurant \"Ten\" just down the street).. And obviously I have not been disappointed since. My recommendation is to order catch of the day. I LOVE their hotategai. It's the sweetest scallop I have ever tasted anywhere.. and I have lived in Japan for a year.. so I would say I know what good sushi is when I taste one. Another fish that really stands out is their kinmedai (red snapper). It's really one of the best.. sweet and the chef sears the skin.. OOHHH.. just typing these words make my mouth watering. \nIn general, if you order catch of the day, you can't really go wrong. Although the one and only time I tried their blue shrimp, I was not super impressed. But it could be an off day for them. \n\nAnd yess I have tried the spoonful of happiness that everybody on yelp rave about.. It's really not my cup of tea. I love uni and I kinda like the ankimo (monk fish liver?).. but I don't think the combination with the ponzu sauce was all that great. But it's just my 2 cents.\n\nThe restaurant has a really nice decor and ambience. When I go there alone, I usually try to sit at the sushi bar and ask for a recommendation from the chef regarding which items on the catch of the day list that he would recommend. I think I have been to Koo for more than 10 times.. and obviously I am impressed. The price is quite right for the quality of sushi that you get.

It's not cheap if you like to gorge yourself on sashimi specials like I do, but it's cheaper than super high end places or a night at Kabuto. I liked their variety of small plates and that they offered some interesting specials, different types of fish that you don't get at every neighborhood sushi place. The fish was fresh too, no signs of mealiness, and some of the portions were pretty generous. \nGripes: Koo is squarely anchored on the mayo/cream cheese/hot/tempura-ed roll bandwagon. Totally necessary to have a few inventive rolls that are free of the mentioned afflictions. Don't get me wrong, I like an occasional foofy roll, just like you'll sometimes catch me drinking beverages with umbrellas in them, but I like roll options with fresh, raw ingredients. Also, there are only 2 choices for white wine. And some of the tables are small and close together.\nService was very accommodating and didn't give us the evil eye for showing up at 1030pm. They get huge points for including an ice bucket with the bottles of white wine. I like my wine icy crisp!

It did get busier later, and even though it's in a quaint space, it never seemed congested. Service was also friendly and attentive. Most importantly, the food was awesome. Unfortunately neither of us came with huge appetites, but we did split the Bamboo Tower (very refreshing salad with lumps of mixed seafood with a nice kick from the sesame-ponzu gelee bits sprinkled about), Marinated Artichoke (very tender with a great shichimi soy may dip), Hamachi Kama (my favorite part of the fish! grilled! amazing!), and then finished up with a Tokyo Crunch roll (spicy fried crunchies, hamachi, unagi, cucumber and tobiko) and sweet shrimp nigiri (raw, of course).

We asked for a table for six and they made up a random rule that in order to seat us we needed to commit to spending a specific amount $ per person.  I believe this is because we had two sushi eating children in our party and they simply wanted to save their tables for customers without children in order to make more money.  They could have also simply told us all the tables were reserved and we would have had no problem with that.  When I tried to reason with them they dug in their heals in a completely unreasonable way.  I found the experience offensive and will never return.

Yeah it's pretty bad, but if you bitch hard enough you might end up with a cool baller parking spot like me, right in front of the restaurant. \nThe place has nice decor and once you step in, that amazing smell of raw fish and sushi rice just smacks you in the face. And it's a good smell. They have a daily special menu and an ordinary menu which is pretty simple to read and order from and the service is good.\nI highly recommend the blue fin 'otoro' which at $15 for 2 pcs sounds outrageous, but it's worth it. I tried a bunch of random fish that I've never tried before including barracuda and deep sea snapper. Both amazing. Some of the other standard higher grade fish like the amber and yellow jack were good but not special. Spanish mackarel I've had better elsewhere.\nFor cooked food, the miso cod was whatever and pretty regrettable/forgettable. Definitely should have ordered another blue fin sushi. \nI heard this place has good omakase from some friends who recommended it, and I'm sure that would be amazing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-01-07", "description": "Came here on New Year's Eve, for a couple reasons. First off my jam Domo in Hayes Valley was closed still, and secondly, thought it was time to expand the sushi horizons a bit more here in San Francisco. Did some research and while I've definitely done it up at Ebisu in the Sunset before, a little placed called Koo began to really catch my eye. Especially after reading that owner/chef Kiyoshi Hayakawa was the one who opened the pretty awesome Tokyo Go Go in the Mission, which obviously is on the right track now and can very likely be attributed to Hayakawa's early insight & culinary perspective.\n\nKoo, which is take on the word \"ku\" meaning \"to eat\" in japanese, is decidedly more low-key, which is nice. It doesn't need to be all ultra refined & semi flashy like Tokyo Go Go cause there's less to compete with around here, and the area just isn't as busy. Once you enter, there's two sides to the restaurant. As many people have pointed out, the main dining area on the right hand side is nothing to write home about. But the 6-seater sushi bar itself is totally separate on the left hand side, and because of that, you really feel like you have a special seat.\n\nMy gf and I did omakase here, along with a big ole bottle of Nigori sake (only one kind of Nigori, the basic kind, and only in large bottle) and a large Sapporo. Being that it was our Koo debut, I think a lot of the chef's selections tonight were also on the menu, but we still had some things noticeably off menu but beyond that, there's some great stuff on the damn menu itself.\n\nStand Outs:\n- A Spoonful of Happiness -  People, there's a reason why there's about 50 fucking pictures of this dish on Yelp. It will BLOW YOUR GODDAMN MIND. It's a double crudo spoon, one with Uni (Sea Urchin) + Quail Egg & topped with ponzu & tobiko, and the other one with Ankimo (Monk Fish Liver) wrapped in whitefish and topped with WHITE TRUFFLE OIL. Even more amazing?  You get a shot of chilled sake to sip before and in between the two crudo spoons. An absolute masterpiece.\n- Japanese Eggplant Dengaku - It's rare that a vegetarian dish ever tops my list at a new sushi place, but I really don't think I've ever had eggplant that tasted this good, ever. We had three cuts, and the eggplant itself is braised with sweet miso. The taste is delectable, but the texture is really where this dish impressed me. The meat of the eggplant was soft yet thick as usual, but the skin was crisped perfectly, making it particularly easy to eat, and ultimately giving it another dimension. \n- Hawaiian Blue Prawn - Delicious freshwater prawn that literally has a vibrant blue tail and was *so* beautiful on my plate. I've never seen anything like it, and apparently SF is one of the few west coast cities who have a chance to experience it. The taste was great as well.\n- 2 kinds of Sea Bream - One was from Japan and I *think* the other was from Hawaii... delicious, light fish related to snapper. They bother were great.\n- Not to sound like a broken record, but I had to top it all off with another piece of Uni sushi. Their sea urchin really had a body that was noticeably and significantly more rich than it is at most places. The chef told us they get them from some special northern california farmer, or something to that effect. Mmmmm.\n\nAll in all, thumbs way up to Koo, I look forward to returning. Now that I'm acquainted with their menu, I'm excited to hit the omakase there again so they can go even deeper with what they serve. It really is an excellent alternative to Ebisu. I've waited at Ebisu for a lonnnnng time in the past, but now, Koo will make me reconsider which place to go to first. Definitely check this joint out if you're looking for a new SF sushi adventure.", "author": "George C."}

The food is good though. It's on the pricier side but you're also kind of paying for the ambience, I guess. The service was a bit gruff when I went but it was also pretty busy. Plates that I would be happy to recommend are Hamachi Kama, Miso Cod, Azteca Roll, and the Best Roll. I like that the rolls are creative but not questionable; you can tell that the chef thought about it and made sure that the combinations of items would work well together instead of creating a crazy roll just because it's new and unusual. That kind of stuff pisses me off.", "author": "Queenie C."}

The Spoonful of Happiness has the best presentation. It comes with two spoons with whitefish, quail egg, and some other stuff that's hard to remember along with a shot of sake. Probably their signature appetizer here. I had the calamari for an appetizer and it was really crispy and tender on the outside. It came with a salsa Verde dipping sauce which I thought was very bland, I preferred a tangier sauce. Only got to try two rolls there, the Azteca and the U2 roll which were both yummy. The Azteca had spicy tuna and a slice of jalapeno but it lacked the spicy kick I was expecting. The Himachi on the U2 roll was extremely fresh.

Uni and quail egg was good, but not orgasmic...same with the monkfish liver wrapped in white fish.  The tuna/salmon tartar really stood out in my mind.

My friend and I oredered the Dragon Roll, some kind of Sake Roll with asparagus that I cannot recall, and the Black Cod appetizer. I ordered green tea and she ordered Iced Tea. The rolls were quite generous and the sauces on the rolls were so tasty that you didn't even need to use soy sauce and wasabi. The seafood seemed quite fresh as well. On the other hand, the Black Cod appetizer was not what I had expected. When I order this appetizer, also offered at other Japanese restaurants, it is usually dry and comes with a sauce. The Black Cod at Koo is served in broth. It was still good, but I prefer the Cod to be grilled and dry with the sauce and not grilled and wet. The vegetables accompanying the Cod in the broth was bland as well. The service could be better, but the restaurant itself is quaint and not too noisy.

I had to restrain myself and keep the bill to $30 per person, so I did not order favorites like hamachi kama or gindara misozuke (miso black cod). I had the ankimo, heirloom tomato salad, toro (boston tuna that night), tai (from New Zealand), the live baby abalone sashimi (awabi), and the spoonfuls of happiness (so very good!). BTW, Koo is not short for Shoku, the on-yomi (borrowed Chinese reading) for the character \"to eat\", but is another kun-yomi (native Japanese reading), kuu, in addition to the common one, taberu. Any 3rd year Japanese student knows this. Kuu is an informal and therefore vulgar verb used to mean \"to eat\". The Japanese would never shorten \"shoku\" to \"ku\". They always take the 1st sound. For example, Buraddo Pitto becomes BuraPi. And to quote from the SF Chronicle: \"Koo, says chef-owner Kiyoshi Hayakawa, could also be spelled 'ku[u]' in Japanese, and is the masculine form of 'to eat.'\" It even says so on the business card; the character has the mouth radical, and is pronounced either \"kuu\" or \"kurau\"; see here: http://www.unicode.org/cgi-bin/GetUnihanData.pl?codepoint=55b0 . And the two spoonfuls of happiness are not swimming in soy sauce. One is snapper and ankimo (monkfish liver, the foie gras of the sea) with a splash of ponzu. The other is raw quali egg (uzura [no tamago]) and creamy uni. People who eat california rolls need not apply.", "author": "Hao L."}

We ordered the tombo, blue shrimp and unagi to start, and let the chef suprise us with the rest. He proceded to make us: salmon salad with miso dressing, amberjack, king salmon, fried shrimp heads, halibut and I can't remember the type of dried fish he gave us, but it was excellent as well. There was a 20 minute wait, but it was Friday at 8pm and let's face it, the wait is usually longer at Ebisu down the street. Also, the service was attentive and there were never any real delays in ordering drinks or getting the check. Totally going back next week.", "author": "Pete J."}

I didn't know we had to make reservation so I was told the wait time was 45min. But, It took us literately less than 20min to be seated. They were extremely polite. Not to comment on the waiters and waitress, they were friendly and very amiable. To the point that I felt like throwing stone at them, \"get me som O-cha now!\" hehe..just kidding. I had to nibble my food just to show politeness(grin).I like koo restaurant (very cool) and will definately go back there again. Sushi is delicious, fresh, and fish quality is top notch. The restaurant is a bit small but very well-used of space. The latern lamps? make the place looks very modern and contemporary. Sushi prices are very affordable about $40 per person + sake.  There aren't many good japanese restaurants in SF. This is one of my new favorites. On other note, nothing related to food, i saw a sushi chef at the bar looks like Tony Blair. An asian Blair-esque. Freaky huh? or maybe it's my sake!", "author": "Michael K."}

We wished there had been more similar non-sushi items on the menu, for those in our  group not crazy about sushi.   It would also have been helpful if the menu had given us some indication of the quantity of each dish, as some tended to include ten to twelve pieces and some were two to four.  We had to reorder additional items a couple of times because we had not ordered enough the first time.  Our waitress seemed slightly annoyed at this and so when we ordered more dishes we had to do it from memory because she had taken away our menu.   We hated to bother her but she was the only person on the waitstaff who seemed to speak English.    This seemed to me a little too \"authentic\" in it's difficulty.   In short, the food was terrific and the staff was obviously working hard, but I wished they could have slowed down a little to educate us on their menu, and maybe give us a clue as to the size of the various dishes and the order in which we might expect them to appear at the table .", "author": "David H."}

The hostess's inviting smile evolved into a worried look. She wanted to accommodate us with a table and poor thing, she was staring at her table chart for about a minute, stressing over where to seat us....Well, can't emphasize enough the quality, fresh ingredients - possibly fish flown in from Japan and other parts of the world to get amazing sushi. I loved the artichoke appetizer accompanied with a dallop of savory, creamy sauce- FYI, the way to eat it is to teeth off the meat - do not chew and swallow! The last part of the artichoke is the best - it's the meatiest! I had the barricuda, black cod, Azteca, Kamikaze, Ikura. The first two are similar in taste to yellowtail - fresh and melt in your mouth like butter! The Azteca and Kamikaze were very good special rolls - note that Kamikaze is spicier than most spicy tunas I've had. Lastly, Ikura was very, very fresh - the best I've ever had at any restaurant.

Every time we've been, we've always had great food, and we always make sure we sit at the sushi bar.  The sushi is good, and they always have a few specials it seems which we love to try.  The interesting thing (at least to me) is that the owner/head chef, isn't actually a sushi chef.  Some of their other dishes are great, but you can't go wrong with the sushi/sashimi here.  You have to sit at the sushi bar because they give you a bunch of extras which they'll make on the fly or have prepped before (like one of the chef's home made pickled veggies).  The owner and his wife (who looks amazing for her age), are extremely nice people and great to talk to.  They'll help with picking food, and can recommend a bit of sake or something new.  The place isn't cheap by any means, but not unreasonable I would definitely say.  You get what you pay for and come out happy is what we think.  Overall, one of our favorites places in the city for not only the food, but also the service.
