My wife and I dine at Kazu Sushi at least once a week. We like the fact that you don't get all of your order at once.

Manager physically touched me hand his hand on my shoulder for a few and on top of that manager kept clapping  in my face while yelling at me saying that I'm being childish that I didn't like their salmon. Alright so here's the deal. These cry babies over here decided to surround my table. Then this lady buts in and puts her two sense in while sitting at the bar and have the sushi chef screaming from behind the sushi bar. \nProfessionalism guys. Professionalism. Lol\n\nFood: Chicken that  Ordered is what gave this place that 1 little itty bitty star.\n\nSo I get there around 10. My partner and I end up ordering two sushi rolls and a bunch of little things.\nMy partner didn't like the sushi roll she ordered so she had let the server know. Server said \" would you like to try the smoke salmon to compare\" \nShe said \"yeah I'll like to taste a small piece \" MIND YOU.. A TASTE . He came back with a whole nigiri smokes salmon. \nSo she took a bite but it still tasted the same and she just put it back on the plate.  Told him she wasn't interested and he brought back the menu for a new order. \nTHEN ASKED ME TO EAT HER ROLL BECAUSE SHE DIDNT WANT IT.  Hold up? Did you just ask me to eat somebody else's roll because they didn't like it? \n\nWe asked for the check and they brought the check still charging us for the entire roll we didn't even eat & for the nigri that was a \"taste\". \n\nSo we let them know there was a mistake on the bill. They said no we need to stop acting childish because we didn't like the roll we needed to pay for it. \n\nThen oh best part -maybe because we are lesbians lol because apparently we are the ONNYYY PEOPLE EVER TO COMPLAIN. literally ever.  Lady even said \" because some people like to complain\"\n\nIt's our fault for \"complaining\" that we didn't like the food. \nSeriously ? We took 1 bite of the sushi and we didn't like the way the salmon tasted but it's our fault because we are the only ones tasting it and sending it back. And lol their sushi chef also tasted the same sushi we sent back ... Yeah I'm sure.  \nThen the manager tells me to pay for the whole meal. Excuse you/ this is not my meal. So don't touch me. don't ask me for my debit card because you wanna charge the whole bill because I'm a \"friend\". \nI Said no, so they said they were going to call the cops. Then that's where the whole clapping in my face and touching my shoulders came into play. I said screw that . Called the police department on my own. You don't touch your  customers. \nSo  I called SFPD they came. Right before they got there the other lady asks \" what time they getting here\" I said \"maybe soon?\"\nSo she tosses the bill on the table again and asks me to pay for the whole thing. I said no. \nSo SFPD got there. We settled it by paying for 1 sushi out of a whole roll $6 because apparently that's how much 1 sushi out of the roll costs \n\nSo congrats Guys! Better make sure you like your food if not then your gunna pay for the whole entire plate even if they threw the whole plate away. Oh and if they accommodate a \"taste\" your paying for a whole other plate too.\n\n\n\nWhen I was walking out I told them never to touch or clap in other customers faces\nThe lady server screams \" don't come back\"\nI said aight. \n\nTrust me.

Yes, I am fully aware that it is a Saturday night.

Not just any risk, but a risk to try out a new Japanese restaurant. Seriousness to the max.\n\nTheir ambience was quite \"Japanesie\" if I do say so myself. This is a traditional Japanese restaurant; mainly sushi and sushi rolls, and maybe a couple of entrees. \n\nThe fish was undoubtedly fresh, but not the best that I've had. From my experience, I think Ebisu has better quality fish. But anyhow, back to my review of Kazu!\n\n-Ankimo ($8.75): OMG THIS IS A MUST GET. 6 STARS OUT OF 5. Yes it is THAT good. They made this monk fish liver pate so smooth that it instantly melts in your mouth. The flavor is simply amazing and UUUGH I wanted more. The only down side is that it only comes with 3 pieces =/ it's slightly larger than most places, but still I think it is a bit overpriced for that little amount. But I would still get it next time just because it is SO FREAKIN AMAZING!\n\n-Fresh Aji ($8.95): definitely fresh! Did not have much taste to it but it is without a doubt quality fish\n\n-Fresh Uni ($7.95): fresh and amazing flavors! Again, very fresh and just the right amount of uni:rice ratio.\n\n-Moriawase ($25): cames with fresh salmon, albacore, saba, octopus, hamachi, kanpachi, and tuna. Like I said earlier, all the fish is extremely fresh! That was it though. For me, the quality is better than other sushi places, but not quite up there like Ebisu. (Sorry for comparing Kazu with Ebisu again)\n\n-Double Double ($12.50): \"Spicy salmon, avocado, and cucumber wrapped with fresh salmon and mango layers topped with spicy sesame chili sauce\". This was a very delicious roll! I would definitely order this again and I think you should give this a try too if you like salmon! It just has a hint of spice, so for the people out there who can't take spicy food like me, this should be fine for you (: \n\n-Hamachi Dragon ($13): it has shrimp tempura on the inside and hamachi/avocado on the outside. This roll was not my favorite, but it was still pretty decent. However, my boyfriend and my mom both liked this more than the double double, so idk...haha. Everyone has different tastes I guess :P", "author": "Jackie T."}

I had the fatty tuna, chicken wing, mackerel, anchovy -ish fish, nabe, and crab ramen.\n\nThe nabe was amazing - i have never seen or heard of this at any sushi spot. It was great to try on chilly day.\n\nThe crab ramen was amazing- top off with fresh and REAL seaweed and crab. It was definitely different than any other ramen I have had, and not as rich as Izakaya sozai's but light and delicious. \n\nAll the fish I had at Kazu was fresh and tasty and I would try to list all the names of the things I ate, but I believe at Kazu the menu can change quite frequently so it wouldnt even matter if I did list them all.

However, the wait is worth it when you can taste the different layers of flavor that each sushi roll is given. For example, the spicy scallop roll had cilantro paired with a sweet and spicy sauce all wrapped in the roll with the scallop and not on top of the roll. \n\nI read a review below about the waitress and the table not receiving their miso soup.

The spice really made the difference.\n\nGrilled Squid- Four words described my initial impression as they placed the plate on our table:  King Calamari is dead.  From the tentacles to the head, everything was nicely plated.  The only issue I had with this was that it wasn't grilled as much as I would have liked it to be.  It was semi-grilled, semi raw.

My friend and I sat by the window. \n\nWhen our waitress gave us our menus, she asked us what we would like to drink. We just went for water. I thought it was strange that they didn't provide complementary tea like most places do, but I shrugged it off. \n\nLooking through the menu, I saw a little notation on the bottom that said to check out their daily specials on their white board. I kept looking around for it and asked my friend if she saw it (she didn't). I guess I talk too loud because our waitress came back to put the white board next to us. The peculiar thing about the special menu was that....the prices were the same as what was in the menu. Hmm...\n\nWhat I liked about their menu was that there was a lot of variety (and they have cute names for some of their items). They had items on their menu that I don't typically see in other sushi shops. \n\nWe ended up ordering one ikayaki (grilled squid), a yamakake roll, and a double double roll. The grilled squid was delicious, the double double roll was delicious, and the yamakake roll was okay. It was plain in taste but it was the prettiest in presentation. Each item was priced around $10.\n\nWhat I liked about everything was that it was all very fresh tasting and well made. My friend wasn't as satisfied as I was, but I think it's because she didn't like her yamakake roll. \n\nOur waitress was a bit slow and didn't check up on us that often even though we were one of the only groups (out of two) that were in the shop.

Konoshiro (adult kohada) was out of this world, uni, shimesaba (splendid marination receipe, with great salt and vinegar balance), aji, hirame, suzuki, mirugai. The good stuff. Prices aren't too far off from Ino, but you do get what you pay for. Going crazy on the white board a la carte ordering will co$t you, which is why some of you prefer to do the \"let the chef sock it to me baby\" style ordering to sample, maybe fill up by getting a burger outside afterwards and save a few more buckeroo$.\n\n- the jive ass rolls here look extremely erotic (but I didn't partake).

One so heinous was experienced at Kazu, I feel it necessary to warn my fellow San Francisco diners, and make an alternative recommendation for Japanese cuisine in the Inner Sunset.\n\nThis was our third visit to Kazu, and our second \"special occasion\" event, a birthday. We arrived early on a Monday evening, to be seated in a window table. We were seated, ordered drinks (disapprovingly non-alcoholic), and were given the special list to view. Our drinks arrived and we decided on an appetizer.\n\nShortly afterwards, we were rudely \"told\" to move to the least attractive table, near the restroom, to make room for another couple, of whom, did NOT have a reservation.\n\nNow, I cannot think of a single reason a restaurant would think that, moving patrons within direct viewing of someone who has just been given the best seating in the restaurant, your previous table, would provide even a reasonably enjoyable dining experience. The dynamics of such a faux pas are, in the dining world, simply not done. Ever.\n\nSure, we have watched scenes like this played out in television or the media, when the famous actor arrives at the trendy restaurant, ala Saturday Night Live. But really? We still can't understand the gall, and unprofessional behavior of the Kazu staff. We left, and will not return.\n\nOur advice, when looking for Japanese cuisine in the Inner Sunset, is located less than 2 blocks East, on the North side of Irving, twords UCSF from Kazu. You will find a Zaggat AND Michelin rated Japanese restaurant, with comparable prices, who understand the art, and need I say common sense and decency, in treating their patrons. Visiting anywhere else, least of all Kazu, is a no brainer.\n\nI cannot, in any way, recommend Kazu.

I also could have dipped some pieces in soy sauce, except for the unspoken rule that it is unnecessary.

In fact the front page picture for this place is a Jive Ass Roll so I wasn't expecting much. Turns out the itamae does not make many of them - he leaves them to his apprentice (his son, maybe? He looked half-Japanese.) The itamae makes all the real stuff.\n\nFirst thing I noticed was the price. If you are looking to get a la carte nigiri, be prepared to rack up a large bill. Price for 2 nigiri bottoms out at like $4.50 for tamago and only goes up from there. I decided to try shinko which was on the main menu at $7.xx but apparently the price of the day was almost $10! Of course, they told me about it, so that was fine.\n\nSushi rice was great. Fish were very fresh and nigiris were packed just right, maybe even erring a little on the dense side, but definitely very good. My only complaint about the nigiri was that the itamae was a little heavy-handed on the wasabi that is integrated into each piece. In some cases I wasn't able to really taste the fish for all the horseradish invading my senses. I'll give it another try, it may just have been an off day.\n\nAlso, their service varies, they have only 1 dedicated waitress (or at least that was the case when I went there.) She was very overtaxed and we had to wait a while to get tea, get the bill, etc. I would suggest coming on a quiet weekday night to get the most out of the service and the itamae.\n\nThat said, currently Okina Sushi is still at the top in my opinion.

We ordered rolls at Kazu last night at 8:15, when the restaurant  only contained customers who had already finished their meals, meaning the chefs had only our table to make food for.  The whole experience felt pretty insulting, just sitting there waiting and waiting and waiting in plain sight while the older chef got drunk and socialized with the customers sitting at the bar who had finished eating and the younger chef flirted with some girl.  It's fine to multi-task, but neither one of them even had their hands doing any work the majority of the time.  \n\nThe whole thing was ridiculous.  They could see us sitting there with nothing but tea for 35 minutes with zero concern.  Sort of hard to believe they're still in business with that kind of lacking service.  What should have taken 10 minutes for any sushi chef to prepare took them 35--our food finally came at 8:50!  It's not like any of the food even had to be cooked.  There was literally zero effort put into our service.  About 25 minutes in the younger chef gets out a huge plate and begins plating one of our rolls--and then continues to make the other four for the next ten minutes, meaning we have to wait until the whole order is done before even getting anything.  Knowing we've been waiting they could have at least sent over the food as it was being completed, instead of making us watch it sit there until they felt like finishing the rest of the order.  The review that mentioned the server coming over to pour tea and then getting distracted after pouring literally three drops and walking away happened to us too!  Obviously if you don't know the owners they won't bother to make you feel welcome or bother even preparing your food until all of their more important customers/friends have left and they have nothing else to distract them.\n\nWhen the food finally did arrive 2/5 rolls were decent/good, but the other three were embarrassingly bad/inedible.

Most of the time I get stuck eating a little cucumber, avocado, ume, and rice. Some tempura too, if I'm lucky. Not so at Kazu! They have a whole vegetarian menu, and it's the most complex vegetarian sushi menu I've ever experienced. I got the spicy veggie tempura roll (I like everything spicy, and this delivered pretty well) and the veggie dragon roll. The dragon roll had eggplant instead of the typical eel and was omg sooooo good. Why can't more veggie rolls incorporate eggplant, I must now know. It was garnished with cilantro too, which I love. The spicy veggie tempura roll had dollops of a spicy mayo sauce which, even despite my volatile hate for mayo, I still liked a lot. But I'm a sucker for spice, what can I say. \n\nSo I think Kazu might be my favorite place for veggie sushi at the moment. I can't wait to try more off the vegetarian menu. Why four stars? Like a previous review said, the service is a little slow and the place is kinda cold. Luckily I brought a sweater thanks to that informative review, but my poor boyfriend did not. They seemed to know this, they had a couple space heaters running.\n\nThere are a ton of sushi joints in the neighborhood, but be sure to give Kazu a shot!", "author": "Ambika C."}

The Inner Sunset has some great shops, there are minimal hills to this location and I feel accomplished riding there...even tho it's not that far from my house in the Mid-Richmond.\n\n** The sushi rolls are a good mix of modern and traditional. Pricing also reasonable.\n\n** The flavor profiles mix spicy and sweet well. Love the mango in my sushi. Thanks for that, Kazu.\n\n** Lastly, the small restaurant seats people comfortably at the bar, or at a table with minimal wait time. This makes it a great place for a date, since you're not swallowed up by a large crowd of people or a blanket of noise.\n\nMy favorite is still Sushi Bistro...but this is a close second having so many of it's own qualities that really make it a stand out restaurant.", "author": "Katy A."}

The service was slow since there were only two waitresses attending the whole restaurant. But, the quality here is unbelievably fresh and the service is still really nice. They have a really cute dispenser for soy sauce that looks like a teapot, and you get warm hand wash cloths before your meal. Downside is that this is a small restaurant with tables too close together. The music they play reminds me of the music played in a department store.\n\nMy dad and I ordered 1] Hawaiian Tuna Poke, 2] Soft Shell Crab, 3] Hawaiian Roll, 4] Uni Sushi, 5] Halibut Nigiri for a total of $43 pre-tip. I can't say much for the uni or the halibut nigiri because I didn't try those. However, the soft shell crab did not fully meet my expectations; it was not as crunchy as I hoped, but still delicious over the salad they dressed with a teriyaki dressing. The mango in the Hawaiian tuna poke and Hawaiian roll were extremely fresh and sweet.\n\nCome here only for sushi. Don't expect other Japanese food such as teriyaki stuff over rice, udon, etc. Kazu Sushi, hence the name, is generally all sushi. I give an extra star for their huge variety here. Downside is that they're only open for dinner.", "author": "Priscilla W."}

And especially in a neighborhood where there are about 4-5 other sushi restaurants within walking distance of this one, competition could be perceived as fierce...yet Kazu manages to set itself apart from the other places by offering items on the menu that you won't find at the typical neighborhood sushi joint!\n\nIn fact, my SO doesn't generally go here knowing what he'll order:  he asks the owner, who usually is working behind the sushi bar, to recommend something, and my SO's taste buds have never been let down!\n\nThe downside?  The services is VERY SLOW.  And the waitress either doesn't understand English very well or is extremely scatterbrained, I haven't figured out which.  Don't be surprised if when you order something with special instructions she brings it out wrong on the first try.  How do I know it's her fault?  Well, we got into the habit of ordering take-out from here once a week, and the sushi chefs memorized our order...but she still kept giving it to them wrong, and they'd correct her for us!  I'm not sure, honestly, why they continue to keep her as an employee, although to be fair, she is polite and seems nice enough.  \n\nThe other downside is that this restaurant is TINY!  You can't get a table for more than four people, and it will still feel a bit squished.  This is definitely NOT a place to bring a large party, they simply won't be able to accomodate you.\n\nOne really nice thing about Kazu is that you never feel rushed.  While other restaurants try to slash and burn their way through customers to get tables sat and re-sat as many times as possible in an evening, Kazu lets you take your time, enjoy, and doesn't make you feel hurried.\n\nI would go here more often if the prices were lower.  It's not that Kazu is overpriced (it's quite reasonable considering the quality), it's just that sometimes I want basic, lowkey sushi rolls that are dirt cheap.  But when I want something a little nicer without the pretentiousness some of the finer sushi restaurants in SF offer, this is where I go.", "author": "Amy L."}

The oyster was so fresh and I really enjoyed the ponzu and garnish.\n\nAt the end, we had squid ink ramen. Whoa, that was surprisingly delicious! Ramen usually uses pork broth, but since this was fish/squid ink based, it was so crisp. Loved it!\n\nI'd give it a 4.5 stars because there were many times that we wanted service, but it was difficult to get the waitress' attention.

A good sign.\n\nThe chicken karage was not so wonderful. Not terribly crisp and it felt really fatty (yes, I know it is fried) - perhaps they used some very fatty pieces of chicken. The tempura was not bad but not super crisp.\n\nThe reason that I am not giving it higher stars is because of the service which was, hmm what are the words, haphazard and unpredictable.  Rice, which I had ordered with the chicken karage appeared ten minutes after the chicken karage appeared. Tempura that was ordered right at the beginning (before the chicken karage) appeared towards the end of the meal. When we added in a request for another bowl of rice halfway through the meal that also took about ten minutes. We had to request refills for the water.

The rice this evening was sticking together about as good as the senate democrats.  I'd pick up my nigiri out of the lil' soy sauce dish (what *do* they call that thing) and half the finger of rice would fall off.  C'mon.  Minus 1.5 stars, almost minus 2 but I'm a happy drunk.\n\nMore good stuff:  Big carafe of hot saki, $6.50, can't beat that with a tatami mat.  In fact I am still good and tipsy if you couldn't tell.    Special fish selection was great too, I had a type of toro I hadn't had before which was really excellent, and an unusual silky-firm texture that I wasn't sure about at first but ended up quite liking.  \n\nService was totally fine, I don't know what all the fuss is about.

This is strictly a sushi place, you're not going to find tonkatsu, teriyaki or tempura meals here.\n\nThe place is small with seating for 24-25 max and no more than 4 at the sushi bar.  I decided to try this place on the suggestion of Yelper Nobu, who posts a list of his fav sushi places.  The solo waitress was running around the room trying to keep up with the orders.  I love the portable circular heater which was close by us on the floor, but the poor thing had to navigate around it with dishes in her hands.  \n\nThis is a good place to come with friends so you can sample different things.  We had fresh oysters on a shell, 3 for $8 from the extensive daily special menu.  It was nice and garnished with bits of ginger and scallions.  2 orders of Combo A, $16 came with a piece each of tuna, hamachi, ebi, salmon, eel, white tuna and hirame.  The hamachi here is very tender and fresh, practicially melts in your mouth.  BFF ordered combo D, $25, which is combo A and a Rock n' roll (delish) and hamachi sashimi - the sashimi was even better than the fish pieces on the nigiri.\n\nI ordered 4 pieces of unagi ($4.75/2 pc) and 4 hamachi nigiri ($4.95/2pc).  The unagi was so tender.  What we didn't like was the rice, not flavored and fell apart to easily that you'd have to pick up the piece with your fingers and quickly shove the piece into your mouth.  Forget the chopsticks, it only breaks up the rice and cause the grains to collapse as easily as a sandcastle, all over your plate.   Now try picking that up with your chopsticks.\n\nWe shared one of their special rolls (19 selections), Dragon $11.50 which was shrimp tempura, cucumber, onion wrapped  with eel and avocado and topped w/tobiko.  I thought it was too sweet.  The miso soup which accompanied the combos was flavorful and had lots of seaweed in it.

It's a more crunchy fish that doesn't melt but still has that buttery toro flavor.\nWild salmon: a softer fish that is noticeably better than farm-raised salmon so it's good for those who love salmon. \nHamachi toro: the fish was harder in texture than salmon; really good.\nUni: very good, sweet & creamy uni\nMiso Black Cod: very, very flavorful. Each piece of meat was jam-packed with flavor. YUM! The piece was quite small; maybe a little bigger than my digital camera.\nAnkimo appetizer: three pieces of ankimo swimming in ponzu sauce. Very creamy and soo good. Went well with the small pieces of green onion.\n\n$48 per person including tip + tax\n\nOverall, great sashimi and nigiri! Order from the daily special's menu and you'll get the freshest fish. There's a good variety and I noticed they have fish not typically seen at other restaurants. They had a variety of toro from different types of fish. Most of the fish from the board are on average about $8 for two pieces. Miso black cod is also a must-try!", "author": "Tina T."}

We ordered: negi-hama,  crunchy spicy  tuna roll, nigiri appetizer, kisu tempura, yakitori, chu-toro, and 2 orders of nigiri from their special menu. Our total was around $93 (including tax). o_O I know, right!? Hella expensive! But then again, the chu-toro sashimi my bf ordered was around $20 and he also had some sake.\n\nFish was VERY fresh! My 5 piece nigiri appetizer ($11)  was delicious! It came with unagi, sake, ebi, maguro, and hamachi. Soooo good! Haven't had super fresh fish in a while. That crunchy spicy tuna roll we ordered was surprisingly good! I don't really like ordering rolls like that but my bf wanted to try it. I'm not into those crazy rolls.  But they had some crazy rolls on the menu. I had to pass.  Anyway,  if the crunchy spicy tuna roll is still on their special menu, I highly recommended it. Its delicious! It wasn't even that spicy so I was still able to taste the freshness of the fish.\n\nAs for that chu-toro...it was my first time trying it. I thought it was pretty intense. Bf loved it.  Kisu tempura was good. Not too much batter. I still like the one at Rumble Fish better. Chicken yakitori was tasty. It was very tender and had a nice flavor.\n\nService was nice. My glass of water was always full. This place is also very small. So I'm sure it gets really crowded on a busy night. We got here around 6:30pm and it wasn't that crowded.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-11-07", "description": "A restaurant with a 4-star on Yelp should be good enough to give it a try right? Maybe not. We went to Kazu Sushi in a group of 6 with empty stomachs on a Monday night. We left 2 hours later with our stomachs only half full and feeling very disappointed. \n\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, it was still empty (with only two tables occupied) so the waitress was able to arrange a large table for us quickly. As we sat down and started looking at the menu, I asked the waitress for recommendations since we had a relatively large group. However, it became clear that the waitress didn't know the menu very well. She said \"I will try\" but was clearly struggling to come up with something interesting for us. Eventually, we ordered hamachi toro nigiri, beef tongue nigiri, grilled miso cod, tempura, some fancy version of agedashi tofu with crab meat (I forget the name), pork belly and some rolls. \n\nHamachi and beef tongue came first. The hamachi was very fresh and tasty, but it was so thinly sliced and laid over such a large clump of rice, that the taste of the rice overpowered the fish. I wished we had ordered sashimi instead so that I could fully enjoy the fish.\n\nMy friends were expecting some raw beef tongue, but what we got instead was some slow-cooked beef tongue over rice. The beef tongue tasted okay, but it was a bit dry on the edges, which was mostly because it had been pre-cut and left to sit uncovered for some time. \n\nThe pork belly was a huge disappointment. Not only was there just ONE small piece, but also the meat was very dry. Yes, we were served some dry fatty pork belly!\n\nThe agedashi tofu sauce was too thick and had too much ginger, and this is despite the fact that I love ginger. I was also disappointed that they did not use silken tofu. \n\nThe cod was cooked just right, but too salty.\n\nThe tempura was awful! Instead of getting the usual fluffy and crispy tempura, what we had was the exact opposite. The shrimp was small and overcooked, and the batter was soft. I would have returned the dish if my friends hadn't eaten them so quickly. \n\nThe rolls were okay, nothing very special and were a little bland. Maybe they would have tasted a little better if they hadn't come at an interval of 20 minutes each.\n\nThe food was mediocre at best and the service was ridiculous slow! It's true that the restaurant is small, with 7 tables plus a sushi bar, but it's not so small that it only needs one waitress. The restaurant filled up quickly after we sat down. The waitress was so busy taking care of other tables that she paid little attention to us. Our tea and hot water were only refilled once for the whole night. After numerous attempts to ask her to refill our cups, I finally asked her to give us a pot of tea and hot water so we could serve ourselves. It took her 10 minutes to bring us half a pot of hot water. The tea never came. \n\nWhile we were \"patiently\" waiting for our food to arrive, we overheard the couple next to us complaining about the freshness of their sashimi. They wanted to cancel their order, but the restaurant refused to do so. The couple ended up paying the full bill. After they left, I saw that their food (one sashimi platter and a couple rolls) was pretty much untouched. \n\nFed up with waiting 20 minutes between dishes, we left before we were full. \n\nIn a nutshell, Kazu Sushi is over-rated, over-priced, and under-staffed. \n\nThe best thing about the restaurant? The orchids displayed in the restroom. They were so stunningly beautiful that for a while I mistakenly thought they were fake.", "author": "Kelly N."}

Now eating sushi AND drinking sake w/ an ice cold Japanese beer in a chilled glass? Even better. On top of that, getting to clean my hands with a hot towel before consuming my meal? Could it get any better? Maybe. But on a chilly Monday, no. \nEvery time I've walked past Kazu, I noticed from the corner of my eye that it was packed. I automatically figured it must be good. Well, I was right. But once going inside it's not surprising why it's always packed. The place itself only has about 5+ tables and sushi bar seating. But that's part of it's charm- I've always been a fan of super small sushi bars, because there's something intimate about consuming my favorite food with a limited amount of people with prompt friendly service! \nI didn't order sashimi this time, but I got the King Kong roll, which was delish. As well as my go to appetizer- a seaweed salad. In some ways Kazu is pricier than other sushi places in the area, but the food is tasty and fresh, and I like the ambience. So no complaining here!

I have been exposed to excellent sushi both through eating in Japan and training.  I can speak only on the fish at Sushi Kazu due to the fact that I have only eaten sushi, sashimi, and some rolls.  The fish are always fresh, portions are large and excellently prepared.  Kazu is there everyday and his quality control is superb.  It is obvious he is more concerned with customer satisfaction over profit.  It is very traditional and has a small staff, so if you in a hurry this probably isn't the place you should go for a quick meal unless you arrive early. But if you want quality fish from a master chef this is the place for you especially if you sit at the bar.  Kazu prepared fresh anago(sea eel) most places carry it frozen  and ankimo(monkfish liver) that were excellent.

Also, bang for the buck, considering the quality of the fish and size of the cuts, seems above average here.\n\nFinally, tipping the scale is the ambiance. Most other sushi places I'm familiar with that provide this quality of food are either too loud, too bright, or the service is too slow, Kazu's place is dim, generally quiet, with maybe a small group enjoying themselves at the bar.\n\nFor these reasons, Kazu has quickly become a favorite.", "author": "Essron J."}

There is this little man that I love very much who LOVES sushi and before we met, used to eat it every other day. Since he met me, he's lucky to eat it every other month. Not that I keep him from his beloved sushi. It's just we don't go to places that are fish only restaurants. But last night, we did. He was happy. I was happy he was happy. \n\nI went for all the non-fish stuff. So if you are a sushi lover and reading my review to learn what's good and what's not about their sushi, you can skip right past my review. Thank you, come again! \n\nIf you want to know what's good on their appetizer and specials menu, please, keep reading. \n\nMy favorite thing of the entire evening was the Chicken karaage. They definitely use free range chicken for this dish. It's very tender and super juicy. They pour ponzu sauce over the chicken that is sitting on a bed of lettuce and thinly sliced red onion. After I ate the chicken, I ate the lettuce which was by that time, warm and drenched in ponzu. SO GOOD. \n\nMy second favorite thing was the shiobuta kakuni. This is a huge slice of thick salted pork belly that seems like it has been slow cooking for days and days. The fat, though still intact, melts on your tongue like warm butter. The meat is soft and flavorful. Usually, I cannot eat huge pieces of fat on a regular grilled pork belly. But this fat was much different and MUCH better. \n\nThe gyoza were awesome! I like that they put a little hot chili oil in the shoyu dipping sauce. \n\nThe tsukune were HUGE. Almost as big as tennis balls. But they lacked flavor, sadly. \n\nThe service is ok. Pretty slow. There's really only one server and she was running around like crazy alllllllll night. But other than that, no complaints.", "author": "Jen D."}

The fish was ultra fresh and well textured, that perfect sushi temperature.\n\nThe fish is a new friend.  Five days later I am still grinning.\n\nThey have the usual line of Japanese and American sushi items but a  wider fish selection than most, plus five or six special fish and some things written only in Japanese.  Things I never heard of.  Rolls come thin and nigiri large, as it should be.  A whole page of appetizers, half standard (sunomono, agtedashi tofu, wakame, hamachi kama) and half new-style (tatami tower).  What you won't find are comfort items like noodle soups or sukiyaki.  Strictly sushi.\n\nThe decor is clean, modern, bright, and stylish without sacrificing the basic respect that it is sushi.  Music is a CD of light but upbeat instrumental jazz.  It is a very small restaurant with only a few seats.\n\nThings are a step upscale.  Miso soup is extra good with many seaweed squares and no tofu pieces.  Soy sauce comes in a small clay pitcher, not a glass bottle.  A steamed napkin.\n\nYou pay extra here but not as much as you think.  Worth it if you can afford it.  If not, be like me.

And I am not one of those picky, snooty restaurant go-ers.

Miso soup and tempura appetizers didn't come out until after our rolls. The \"specialty rolls\" which are already too expensive ($11-$13) only contained FOUR pieces! Our last roll never even made it to our table because we got tired of waiting and asked for the check. Rice came out at the end. Sushi was okay at best. We noticed that every couple or individual that came in after us and had reservations were waiting around in the tiny, cramped doorway for at least 20-30 minutes.\n\nOverall: Sushi and service is not worth the price here.

I was with 3 others, and after the appetizers (which came on time and together), each person's meal come one after the other.  \n\nIt's like we were all going throught a drive-thru one by one, only sitting down.\n\nTo top it off, my dish, the sashimi platter, came last!  This is not paella cooked inside unleavended bread under a wood fired stone buried in a morroccan desert sand oven or some such.  Hello, I'd like some cut, uncooked fish placed on a clean plate. Oh, that'll be 40 minutes please.\n\nIf they couldn't get that straight, then I got a little worried that they didn't do the sashimi right (i.e., kept clean, fresh, etc).  In fact, very uncharacteristically of me, I didn't finish it b/c something was rotten in the state of Denmark: something tasted, well, fishy.\n\nSo that just made me less predisposed to this place:\n\n-- The chairs were wierd (folding, I later realized), so whenever I tried to move my chair, it would seem to catch on the rug when in fact it was folding up.\n\n-- Music.  This is a sushi restaurant, not a club in the castro.  Okay, a slight exaggeration.  But why do restaurants to this nowadays?  Why don't they put in garish, hard plastic seating while they're at it?  Or those bird spikes found on building ledges?\n\n-- Large, round plates didn't fit well on the small table.  I see why the rectangular dish rules in sushi joints.\n\n-- I didn't think the selection was particularly interesting (cod and other fish are big these days, but not at this place yet).\n\nThere are lots of great sushi joints out there- this isn't worth revisiting for a while, in my book.  \n\nI think the problem is that they seated us before our party had all arrived, and we spent some time between ordering appetizers (which were fine and on time) and ordering the main dishes. This is where they fell apart, and they couldn't get us back in the queue.  Maybe they were squeezing in our plates whenever they could, which is why we got them piecemeal.  Sigh.", "author": "T W."}

Hope it  was an off day for the service too because they were extremely slow getting the sushi out to our table of 4. My friend's sashimi plate order came out last, after the rest of us had already finished our meals! So well, we kept him company while he ate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-02", "description": "I've eaten at Sushi Kazu on 5 different occasions now. Why would I keep going back, you might ask, if I only rate it 3 stars? The dilemma is in the food vs. service, as has been noted by several others. We eat at sushi bars all over the Bay Area and the fish and creations on offer at Kazu are excellent.  \n\nIt has a very intimate and authentic atmosphere. \n\nThe problem is that there is only one dedicated server (Kazu's wife, I believe). Her demeanor and service are great. The problem is her efforts alone are simply insufficient when the restaurant is over ~ 50% capacity.  I'd had one bad experience with service there before last night and last night drove it home for me. I was without water for a good portion of the meal (which was close to 2 hours for 3 rolls and 1 order of sashimi). \n\nLuckily we received our first roll inside of 15 minutes (which saved my wife from eating her hand) but then we literally had a 30+ minute wait before the second roll arrived.  No matter how good the food is, that type of delay makes for an unpleasant dining experience.\n\nSO now I've learned my lesson about Sushi Kazu. To enjoy their excellent fare, here is what you do: \n\n1) Drive, bike, walk or scooter to the adequate front window of the restaurant.\n\n2) Look inside.\n\nHere's where we come to the \"choose your own adventure\" part:\n\n3a) If there are several seats at the sushi bar and the tables are less than half-occupied, you're in luck! Go in, grab a seat at the sushi bar (best service) or at least be sure to order quickly from your table (make sure you check out the specials whiteboard) and pray that large numbers of people don't show up until your food is served.\n\n3b) If the sushi bar is mostly full and the tables look fairly full, KEEP MOVING - go on to Koo, Ebisu or Ten (I would recommend in that order)...all also along the Irving Inner Sunset corridor and serving excellent to solid fare in their own right. Come back to Kazu on another night. It's that simple.\n\nIf you continue in to Sushi Kazu when it is over 50% occupancy, it is at your own peril and you can not later claim that you haven't been warned.\n\nThough Ebisu or Koo may be more crowded (you may have a longer wait for a table) rest assured that your total dining experience will  take less time. And I'm not arguing that a meal needs to be fast to be enjoyable...just efficient in the sense that so long as you are ordering food and drink it is brought to you in a fairly expeditious manner.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "Noel B."}

I also had a fried small fish appetizer here that was really good too.\n\nBut let's be serious.  Nigiri is the reason I eat at sushi bars.  Kazu Sushi's nigiri have not been very consistent.\n\nKazu's sushi rice is some of the best I have ever had: just enough vinegar, each grain tender, not mushy, and just sticky enough to be cohesive with its neighbor.\n\nThe fish, though always fresh, was better on my first visit because it was cut more neatly.  On my first visit, I sat at the bar and ordered mainly off the specials board.  That had a good variety for fresh local and imported fish, many not commonly seen on menus in SF.  I had a great meal.\n\nOn my second visit, sitting at a table rather than at the bar, I got a sushi combination dinner, and the knifework was kind of shoddy: the fish was all raggedly cut, and didn't sit on top of the rice quite as well.  However, the uni nigiri I got were eyes-rolling-back delicious.\n\nPerhaps the chef will do a better job on the fish if you're sitting at the bar or ordering something more interesting than the same ol' maguro/sake/hamachi/tai standards.

If you are looking for the ordinary experience of California and dragon rolls and a few pieces of tuna nigiri, you may or may not find Kazu to your liking. But if you enjoy ordering off the specials board, and enjoy cooked food as well as sushi, you're in for a treat.\n\nThe fish Kazu carries is exquisite. I have for sure had the best hamachi at Kazu that I have had in 20 years of steady sushi eating all over the United States. Fish does vary from day to day no matter where you are, but the quality at Kazu is consistently excellent, and the variety is as good as at Sushi Sam's in San Mateo.\n\nIn addition to sake and beer, Kazu carries shochu, which is a pleasant treat if you are into that sort of thing. (I am.)\n\nLike many traditional sushi restaurants, table service may be slow (\"relaxed\"), so be prepared to get your entire order in at once, and don't expect your food to arrive all at once (it won't). If you want to order a bit at a time, you need to sit at the bar.  It is not necessarily expected that a waitress will take a second order for food (unless you have specifically ordered just appetizers) from a table.\n\nIf you want to eat at the bar, call for a reservation at least a day ahead. Sometimes it's full all evening.\n\nIf you are a genuine connoisseur of Japanese food other than sushi, you may be able to arrange other meals (like sukiyaki) with Kazu, given a week or two of notice, although I wouldn't advise scheduling it on a busy night.\n\nFor parking, drive toward 12th on Irving.", "author": "Joseph H."}

I am not a sushi snob, but a sushi purist - I believe that the best sushi does not need soy sauce, eel sauce, or any other condiment to cover up the fresh, slightly sweet taste of a perfectly cut piece of fish. \n\nWith that said, I ordered off the \"white-board menu\" which are the Kazu specials. All sashimi was of the finest quality! Perfect temperature, perfectly cut, perfectly tasty. I ordered the scallop, sweet shrimp, kampachi, toro, mackeral, some sort of special Japanese mackeral that is only in season a few months of the year (i forget the name), albacore, hamachi, chicken kaarage, pork belly, carpaccio, and the tofu salad. \n\nAlthough I usually avoid it, I actually have tried the rolls before, and they are very good as well, much tastier and more creative than your average sushi restaurant.  Steer clear of Japan Town - this place will please everyone, except anyone who likes soupy stuff like udon and soba. Unfortunately, they don't serve it. :(", "author": "D N."}

Basically, if you are hungry and you're here with your friends, you're screwed in an unsatisfying way because you'll be left so hungry that you'd lick the bottom of any plate. My friend had been here a couple of times and suggested this place for dinner. Boy...we were disappointed.\n\nThe service was horrendous. We were a party of four and arrived at 6:30PM. We didn't have to wait very long for a table as they were clearing a table. The party in front of us (two kids) were sat maybe a minute or two before us. When did they get their food? Almost an hour and a half before ours. We sat there for about 15+ minutes before our order was taken. We sat there for 1+ hours while we waited for our order to arrive. One of our friend's roll came out about a little over an hour. Ours...twenty mins later. \n\nI will say that the rolls were tasty, but they added my friend's roll on my plate and when I tried to move it into another plate, the roll disassembled. The rice kept sticking to the other rolls. I had the spicy veggie tempura, florida roll, and the spicy scallop roll. The prices were reasonable. I paid $18 for three rolls and a can of coke.\n\nHowever, back to the service...our teas were rarely filled. I had to wait ten mins for my first a cup of tea. When the waitress asked us if everything was okay, I told her that we ran out of soy sauce a while ago, our teas had to be refreshed, and we still didn't get the last two rolls. There was one waitress and two sushi chefs. I've been to other sushi restaurants that know how to bang out delicious sushi quickly. \n\nI don't know what the chefs are doing at Kazu Sushi. Maybe while you wait, they run to the ocean to catch your fish before slicing it up and finally serving it...an hour later.\n\nWe thought we'd have a quick dinner, but we didn't end up leaving until almost 8:30PM because the service was THAT slow. I'd definitely pass on this place. Not worth it unless you want to spend half your evening waiting for your food.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

The toro, scallops and hamachi are esp. delicious according to family members. As I'm preggers right now, I'm staying away but could see from the look of the fish and the look on everyone faces that they're fantastic. The mackerel looked good too but of course I couldn't have that either...\n\nMy personal favorites are the kamikaze roll, goma-ae (spinach salad with sesame) and the black cod. Also tried a few pieces of the soft shell crab rolls, which were fabulous.

As others have also commented, though, the service is indeed slow - food takes a while, drinks aren't refilled quite as fast as you like.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-21", "description": "Wow, this is the worst experience I've had at a Japanese restaurant, and the Japanese are known for great service so that's sad. I came in with my husband for a romantic dinner. But from the very start, things were not enjoyable. \n\nWhen we walked in and stood with three other people in the crowded doorway, nobody greeted us, much less seated us, for at least ten minutes. It got  to the point where I thought we should just seat ourselves at one of the empty tables, except there was that one party ahead of us. I then whispered to my husband, if no one even greeted us in another ten minutes, we should leave. Finally, the one and only waitress there seats us. \n\nWe took our time looking at the menu because it seemed the waitress would take a long while before getting back to us. (The table next to us were ready to leave but were getting annoyed about not receiving their check after a long wait.) A look at the menu shows a very appetizing selection of rolls and nigiri. I ordered the spicy veggie tempura roll, and my husband the beef roll and saba shioyaki. \n\nWhile we're waiting for our food, we notice a couple of things that don't make sense. First, the dining area which was already crammed, was further shrunk by the huge shoji screen they placed at the front side of the bar. I realize they probably want to make a \"behind-the-scenes\" area for the sushi chef but it makes one feel a little claustrophobic. Second, AFTER we ordered our food, we then saw the \"Specials\" whiteboard which was sitting on a chair, facing only one of the tables. We later learned that they rotated the placement of this whiteboard as parties were seated and looking at the menu. But they didn't bother to show the specials to us, or maybe the smarter thing to do would be to just hang up the whiteboard so everyone can see! Hmm...what an idea. Lastly, it was freezing cold and they didn't have central air so they placed parabolic space heaters on the floor. It was a nice courtesy for the heat but it got in the way of getting to my seat and walking to the bathroom. One of the heaters was also placed so close to a tablecloth we thought it could be a fire hazard. \n\nWhen our food finally came twenty minutes later, which I think is considered fast for this place, we did a double take at the portion size. We had ordered two rolls but got only one plate with eight pieces on it. I seriously thought another plate was coming but to our disappointment, each roll was only four pieces! I mean, four-piece maki at those prices?! They tasted good, not amazing, but they were so NOT worth it. If you want vegetarian sushi at a more reasonable value, try Cha-ya. We've never been disappointed there. Also, my husband's saba shioyaki was ridden with bones. Not four or five, but almost wrapped in bones was how he described it.\n\nI think this place tries to be authentic and high quality but the execution of a fine dining experience just isn't there. Definitely not returning.", "author": "Nancy W."}

We showed up at 7, and were immediately seated.  I love that the menu is pretty much only sushi - no bento boxes or other distractions.  Quite a few appetizers that sounded good, including agedashi nasu (eggplant), but we settled on the hamachi kama and an assortment of nigiri and rolls.  The spicy salmon came out first, and pretty quickly...but then it felt like maybe another 20 or 30 minutes before any other food came out, and even then the rest of order slowly trickled out.  For us, this was forgiveable, as we were sharing everything that was ordered, plus there was a big group (10 people) who were seated right before us so we had counted on some wait time.  But for diners who like to order their own dishes and not share (shame on you, sushi is more delicious when shared!), this could have been a problem.  \n\nThe sushi was all so fresh and made perfectly! For nigiri we ordered the maguro, kanpachi, hirame, and hamachi. we wanted the tai, but they were out.  The kanpachi really stood out, so fresh!  The spicy salmon roll was fine, but the spider roll and the king kong roll were soooo good.  The soft shell crab was fried light and crispy, just like it should be.  Oooh and both of these rolls had pickled gobo (burdock root), a personal fave. The hamachi kama was served with a bit of daikon and a ponzu-soy tasting sauce for dipping. delicious.  ooh, and only $70 to fill us up on sushi and asahi.\n\nWe were so pleased with the food, especially the quality and freshness.

Just had dinner here tonight, and it was quite good.  The chef has some skills!   Everything here was good, though the prices were a little high.  For instance, if a hamachi-kama (yellowtail jaw) is around $10, I expect to get the WHOLE jaw, not just 1 half.  However, the jaw was perfectly grilled/roasted shioyaki.  The gindara was excellent, black cod perfectly marinated with miso, however the serving size was not as large as Koo's, although the quality was comparable (I like koo's presentation better with the greens and \"soupy\" base).  The nanbanzuke was quite interesting--never had anything quite like it.  It was a fried fish (can't remember the name in english...I remember it was a spanish name starting with a vowel like E) that was marinated after it was fried, so is served cold in a slightly sour ponzu-like sauce, served with green onions and cilantro.\r\nMy favorite dish he made, however, was the hotate ayaburi (I think that was the name) tataki, served as nigiri sushi.  It was a seared scallop (hotate) with some scallions and ginger on top--the flavor balance was impeccable, as well as texturing and everything.  Quite awesome.  I would order LOTS more of this sushi.   Unfortunately, they were out of my favorite uni.  As raw fish goes, their king salmon was excellent (no tendons, well portioned, excellent cut), their amaebi was good--and the head was quite good, since they removed the main outer shell for you, making it a lot easier to eat.  Next time I will ask for it in a miso soup, and see if he'll prepare it that way for me ;).\r\n\r\nWhile I didn't order it, they did have a chirashi sushi here.  $22.  Not a bad price.  I'll have to get it next time, since my friend asked to have more maguro and sake than I personally need--I want to see what goodies it comes with.  The tamago, however, did not have the nicely carmellized layers like Kitsho did.  From what I saw, though, the fish all looked good.\r\n\r\nI will definitely be back to try some of the remaining items, which look interesting.  Definitely good food here.  The sake menu looks to be remnant of one of the old Chika sake menus, so the selection is not bad--though they lack a lot of the high end stuff chika had, like the kubota.  They still have some nice daiginjos and ginjos however--be sure to ask for the sake menu.\r\n\r\nThe chef, Miyauchi-san, is from ten-ichi in the fillmore.

The restaurant might be Japanese operated but this act is just plain insulting to customers and a disgrace towards other Japanese restaurants.. makes Kazu cheap and sleazy.

The place is very small and fits a sushi bar and about 8 tables. When we got there, we didn't have any reservation so we had to wait for about 15 minutes to get our table. While we waited, we studied the menu and discussed our game plan to strategy what we should try that evening. \n\nAlthough the place is small, it offers a pretty remarkable variety of sushi with top quality fishes. In addition to the regular menu, the restaurant also offers specials of the day with fish and seafood they can get their hands on. Our server brings us a white board with hand written specials, unfortunately we didn't recognize some of the Japanese names of fishes and seafood. But we quickly overcame this problem with the help of our nice server describing to us the texture and taste of the fishes. We ordered 3 different kinds of fish nigiris and tried 2 kinds of clams nigiris featured on the board - one has a soft texture and not briny at all, and the second one a little more chewy and has a stronger taste of the ocean. Both were very different and very tasty. We also ordered amaebi nigiri and when the deep fried shrimps heads arrived, we both looked at each other and laughed as we confessed that the real reason for ordering amaebi was for the crispy, salty, deep fried shrimp heads. Is like eating shrimps chips. Don't deny it, you know you do the same too. \n\nWe split an order of mixed sashimi salad with salmon, tuna and yellow tail cut into cubes and served with a bed of mixed greens and seaweeds drizzled with Japanese sesame seed dressing. We loved the salad because it is healthy, very tasty and satisfying. We talked about copying the recipe to make it at home, but we were too afraid to handle raw fish in at home fearing of food poisoning if we didn't do it right. \n\nI just love small, intimate restaurant own and run by the owner and family that serve wonderful dishes.

I remember Chika (the former restaurant at this location) from when I would go there with my dad after school when I was 6 years old. I would always order salmon teriyaki, and the ikura they put on top was my introduction to sushi, as I began to order ikura sushi. anyway, so many years later here i am at sushi kazu.. wow. it was really yummy. we ordered the oysters (3 gigantic oysters for $8). the oysters came with ponzu sauce, tobiko, and green onions on top. total taste of the sea. explosion of ocean water in the mouth. SLURP!!!!!!!!\n\nthen, we got the tuna carpaccio.. wow just scarf up those 6 slices of tuna drizzled in more ponzu and tobiko. MMM. i love these flavors so much.\n\ni also had uni.. it was great with a wonderful texture. the spicy hotate (scallop) roll i had was great too, a nice hot, but not overpowering, flavor! i tried the sake (salmon) too, which had the perfect hint of sweetness that salmon should have. and of course i had tobiko.. MMM... wow. crunch crunch splizzit (flying fish juice squirting in mouth) crunch. i love the feel of tobiko exploding between your teeth, don't you?\n\nfor dessert i had mango mochi ($1.50). Yummy. sliced in half too, how cute!! I would definitely go here again. yes they only have one server (a japanese woman.. she was very cute. for instance i asked what a hotate kiyokyu (i spelled that wrong) was, and she couldn't explain it, so she drew a scallop on the back of her server pad and highlighted which part of the scallop was included in that dish. my tea was constantly being refilled. service was a little slow, but it's understandable. go here, relax, and enjoy. authentic japanese cuisine.", "author": "O K."}

It's actually really late because I went to Kazu Sushi in November last year, but better late than never... right?\n\nIt was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to Kazu Sushi because I'd been talking about wanting sushi.  We're both Japanese so we have pretty high standards for sushi.\n\nWe were both happy with the quality of the food.  Apparently it's usually far more crowded but we were lucky.  It wasn't ridiculously cramped (which is good because I'm not good with too much noise and the idea of inhaling everyone else's air makes me somewhat ill).  It also gave us more time to talk to Kazu, who is the owner and is also behind the sushi counter.\n\nHe's a nice guy (possibly somewhat shy at first).  There were a few regulars there that night who said it was their third time there that week.  Dedicated indeed.\n\nWe'll definitely be back, too.", "author": "F. H."}

I've been there multiple times now and I've been satisfied every single time. Since I have been there often, these are the things i recommend new people that want to try Sushi Kazu out go/do.\n\n1) Ask for the specials of the day. It's usually on a white board near the entrance on the right. Kazu-san gets many types of fish that other sushi places never carry, and they are worth trying. Yum!\n\n2) Try to go on Tuesday, Thursday, or Saturday. I've noticed that those are the off peak days for some reason and an early dinner (6-8pm) is a great time since they seat around  25-30 seats and you don't want to be there when it's packed. Less people = Faster service \n\n3) All the sushi are to die for but if you would like some appetizers to start with i recommend: \"Yakitori\" Momo=chicken skewer / Tsukune=chicken meatball skewer (w/salt), better than any yakitori restaurant i've been to in ages. \"Ankimo\"=Monkfish liver (cooked w/ponzu sauce i believe) Melts away in your mouth before you even know it. \n\n4) You must, and i say you must try a glass of the \"Takenotsuyu\"=Nihonshu=Sake. It's something like $9 a glass but boy  is it good!! I usually don't drink but even my buddies that love to drink all agree with me that this Sake is delicious. I tried to look for it everywhere in the Japanese supermarkets and other restaurants but it's no where to be found, so I get one or two of these glasses while i enjoy my food.\n\nI hope my review will help some people out that are looking for a great place to eat \"Real\" sushi.", "author": "Andrew S."}

It is a worthy successor to Chika. \n\nThis is a straight-forward sushi restaurant - they are not into the eccentric fusion sushi and bizarre rolls here.  However, there are some interesting-looking hot dishes that I'll try in the future. Prices are reasonable for what you get.\n\nThe fish was of excellent quality - best kohada I've ever had. The shiro maguro was like butter. My companion loved the toro. The portion sizes of the sushi were very large. Presentation of the fish was clean and spare. The sunomono (cucumber salad) presentation was beautiful, and it tasted as good as it looked. Everything we had was wonderful, including 2 dishes that just appeared at our table, compliments of the house. (New restaurant = trying harder to get you to come back.) The first of these was two grilled sardines, with a little piquant sauce of some kind, diced green onion, and shiso (?) strands - very  tasty. The second freebie was delivered to our table by the sushi chef himself, along with 2 shots of a sake he thought would compliment the dish (he was right). I had never had this dish: squid with a sauce made of squid stomach (I *think* that's what he said). It had a very unusual taste to a Western palate. We chatted with the sushi chef, who told us that he is from Tokyo. \n\nThe menu lists several decent sakes - we had a bottle of a junmai gingo, very good and reasonably priced. The waitress is pleasant, but her English is minimal - this would be a good place to practice your Japanese. \n\nAs for the decor, it still looks pretty much like the old Chika, but it's been de-mom-and-popped: the TV is gone, replaced by a music system; the posters and clutter up front are gone, replaced by tasteful art and a screen up front. The overall effect is lighter, more elegant and spare - just like the sushi. This is a good addition to the Inner Sunset community, and I anticipate many repeat visits to Kazu.", "author": "Debi L."}

And they were simply \"ok.\" They both sounded orgasmic in their descriptions and they ended up being a little less flavorful and less interesting than I thought they would be. The other disappointment was that our waitress was not very attentive. She seemed like she was trying but it just wasn't up to par. She took my boyfriend's order early even though we told her we just wanted appetizers first. And I told her I would order when she came back with the miso soup. She instead ignored that and brought my boyfriend's order while I sat there. Sure, maybe she didn't hear me or simply forgot...but come on! Additionally, she never asked us if we wanted any water to drink or even if we wanted another coke after our first cans were long gone. As a matter of fact, she never stopped by to see if everything was going okay for us at all! To top it off, we had to wait forever for her to bring over the bill.

I had uni, unagi, hamachi, and tekka maki. I also had rice and saba misoyaki. Compared to Koo and Hama-ko, I would say this place seems to be better with regard to quality of Sushi. The saba misoyaki, was a little too asian-fusion like(think upscale french restaurant) in the way it was served (in a deep bowl garnished with thinly shredded green onion and raddish)and was a bit over priced $9. Ie you can get it at Nijiya for about $4 for double the quantity. My meal came to $34 including tip. \n\nSo its I guess what you could consider normal for one person at a sushi restaurant. The reason I don't give 5 stars is that the waitress, who appeared to be the sushi chefs wife was busy writing something down the entire time I was eating and I had to call her over ( to get a tea refill, order more food and get more ginger). So not so good service since I was only one of two parties at the restaurant.

It's right in the neighborhood, and my wife and I knew it was on the slightly more expensive end of the spectrum. So we picked a special night and decided to give it a shot.\n\nFrom the good to the not-so-good:\n1) VERY fresh fish. The uni was as fresh as any my wife has ever had. The ikura was equally fresh, but we were surprised by how small they were. The maki rolls were very good as well, but a little on the small side; we ordered the rainbow roll (see #4 below) and another roll whose name escapes me: it's the roll that is the second one pictured by \"Daniel K\" in the photo gallery, the one with shrimp tempura on the inside. The toro nigiri almost seemed like it had been pre-frozen...there was something not quite right about its texture. I'm used to it practically melting in my mouth (when it's very good). Not so with our order.\n2) Overall, relatively high prices for relatively small portions...but we knew about the high prices going in.\n3) INCREDIBLY slow service, though this may be due to the fact that we were there on a Saturday evening in a packed little space. Both waitresses are very pleasant, but the guys behind the sushi bar could pick up the pace a little bit. I've never been to a sushi place in the city where there is so much time between served items. Ikura nigiri and toro nigiri arrive (this is really not much food, mind you). Twenty minutes later (no joke), a single maki roll arrives. Consumed in about five minutes. Fifteen minutes later, saba nigiri and hirame nigiri. 15-20 minutes later, another maki roll. At this point, I ask my wife \"Is this how the high-end sushi restaurants in Japan do it?\" No, it's not.\n4) We ordered a couple of maki rolls and several orders of nigiri sushi. Two items, the rainbow roll and the tai nigiri, had not even come to us when the waitress prematurely brought us our check. We were like \"Huh??!\" She proceeded to tell us \"oh, we are out of tai\" - umm, that info would have been useful more than an hour earlier when we placed our order (or any time between then and the time the bill arrived...prematurely). I asked \"What about the rainbow roll that we ordered?\" She was like \"Oh...I'm so sorry, did it not arrive? Let me go have that prepared\" to which I quickly responded with, \"Wait, how long is it going to take?? If it's going to take 20 minutes, we'll just pay now.\" The rainbow roll arrived in about 5 minutes; it was small but tasty, as expected...but our appetites was already on the way out the door.\n\nI agree with many of the reviewers who say this is probably one of the better sushi joints in SF (ONLY as far as quality of fish is concerned), but the negatives far outweigh the positives for us. From now on, we'll probably stick with Ebisu in the neighborhood.", "author": "B. Earl K."}

Their ONE selection of salt-yakitori is not bad (it's jidori or free-range chicken) and they also do a decent job frying things (think fried calamari, fried squid, etc).  But do yourself a favor and come either at 5pm when they open or on a non-peak weeknight, otherwise you'll have to wait a long time and you'll just get really frustrated.", "author": "P B."}

I walked in here at about 7:15pm on a Thursday night to order a couple rolls to go. There were people seated but not every table was full. There were two (or one, i really couldn't tell what was up with one woman) waitresses scurrying around and a sushi chef with a couple helpers. I walk through the door, the \"maybe waitress\" asks \"jus' 1?\" I said, no I would like to place an order to-go. She tells me okay and walks away. I assume she is going to come back and take my order, but then she never leaves the kitchen again...hmmmmm, so I stood there looking like a moron for about 5-10 minit watching the other waitress try her hardest not to look me in the face. Finally, she takes my order. Then she gets my phone number because she says there are lots of orders and it could be a while. Fine. I am no fool, I knew what was going on...they were going to make everybody's orders who were seated in the restaurant before even starting on my two rolls. Bullshit. It took 40 minutes for me to get my food. And my fears were confirmed when I watched the girl who walked in and sat down 10 minutes after me, receive her food 10 minutes before me. Again, I call bullshit. Have to admit though, the sushi itself was pretty good...think I'll stick to Ebisu from now on, or maybe I'll just sit down inside the restaurant!", "author": "Amanda S."}

If you're looking for the cheesy 'everything and the sink' rolls...then this is not the place for you!  If you're looking for fresh fish and fish that melts in your mouth...then this is the place!  My fiance and I love love love sushi and will go anywhere for it, but now that we've found Kazu...this is our weekly sushi spot!  Kazu and his wife are so nice and accommodating that we feel it's our 'Cheers'.  This place is a no-brainer when it comes to great food!", "author": "Marsha L."}
