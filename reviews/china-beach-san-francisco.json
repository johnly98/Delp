It's a beach in a small cove that allows swimming.  It's a somewhat steep walk down from the parking area (which is fairly limited) to the beach.  \n\nOn a clear day, the views of the Golden Gate Bridge from the beach can take your breath away; on foggy days it can look eerie enough to have been lifted from a Stephen King novel ;-)\n\nWhile swimming is allowed, it should be noted that the water has strong undertows, and the water temperature is colder than an IRS Auditor's heart; caution is advised even for swimmers equipped with wet suits.\n\nThe beach and the cove were named for the Chinese laborers and fisherman who used to camp in the area during the 19th century.  There's a monument of sorts called China Beach Rock that was built in the 1980s to honor these early settlers.  Here's the inscription from China Beach Rock:\n\n\"Since gold rush times, this cove was used as a campsite by many of the Chinese fishermen who worked in and around San Francisco Bay. Their efforts to supply the needs of a young city helped establish one of the area's most important industries and traditions.\"", "author": "Janey E."}

That's what I saw in my dream.\n\nIt is still with me, it's been with me all day. It's been with me since last summer. Whether a day goes by, or a week, or a year -- when something is a part of you, it's just a part of you.

I can see the way across. \n\nOh, it can see a little foreboding to get from city to beach. But I promise those stairs are safe, one step at a time, and when you get here you will be happier than you ever were in your old life, just a few blocks from where I am now.

As we were looking up options, we happened to see China Beach suggested on google. I'm so glad we went here! This beach offers a perfect view of cascading cliff sides, the mountains and the Golden Gate Bridge all in one! \nThe beach is located in the midst of a nice neighborhood with beautiful houses and it has its own parking lot above the beach. There are steps leading down to a concrete pavilion and another smaller wooden walkway down to the shore. The beach from what I've seen from reviews and our own experience, seems to be a little hidden gem which keeps this spot secluded and the visitors to smaller amount. I'm a nature girl who likes to enjoy the scenery in a more peaceful environment. \nThe real star of the show was the view - OMGoodness the view!!!  From one side of the shore, you can see cliffs, foliage and the beautiful houses built on top. In the middle, you can look out on the water and the outline of the mountains cutting through the skyline. Then on the other end are more cliffs and a picturesque view of the Golden Gate Bridge.

I try to go home to the city every month or so and each time I go back, I try to get a different vantage point of my beloved Golden Gate Bridge. China Beach provides that and then some. \n\nThere is a small parking lot located at the entrance above China Beach. There are clearly marked spaces and you'll notice the mansion behind you in a peach/pink color is probably the Ambassador to Switzerland's residence with the Swiss flag flying in the wind... What a view that household must have every morning! There is also a monument at the entrance that commemorates China Beach as a campsite that many Chinese fisherman used during the Gold Rush. So you get a little history and a view to match it.\n\nYou make your way down to the beach via 2 routes. The wide steps that are covered in sand or the longer paved path. Either way, it will get you to the bottom. You will see a structure whose inside is no longer open to the public along with its restrooms. But there are 2 bigger sized port-a-potty units near the base of the big set of stairs. I had to use one of them and to my surprise, it was SUPER clean. I think it had gotten changed out/cleaned up that morning. Either way, I was extremely grateful... You can go onto the roof level of the structure and that provides a bird's eye view of the beach. \n\nMake your way down some more stairs and you''re on the sand. To the right is the Golden Gate Bridge in the distance. It looks great on a clear day or on a foggy day. It's just a gem of a beach. Super peaceful with no one really out on the day we went. It was a little foggy and misty. Just the way I like it. There was a dad with his 2 kids playing on the sand near the stairs but they soon left. We had the beach all to ourselves. I took so many photos. Couldnt help it... I truly enjoy being a tourist at home. China Beach is one of those places I can go back to over and over again.", "author": "Chuck D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-21", "description": "Oh, China Beach, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways!\n\n1) Location.  As the old real estate axiom says, location, location, location.  And what a location it is. China Beach is a stunning  publicly owned piece of  coastline, located in a cul-de-sac off El Camino Del Mar near 28th Avenue. You can easily ride your bike down Lake Blvd., under the shade of sprawling trees, in the comfort of your own bike lane or take the #1 California bus or #38 or 38L Geary bus to 28th Avenue.   Then head towards the ocean on 28th Avenue.  There is one small sign that points to the 'public beach'.  That's right; one.  If you are driving or riding your bike, you will have to take a sharp U turn at that sign to access the beach, otherwise you too will meander along the  Seacliff Avenue mansions, and never get to the beach.  This is a small beach, a little off the beaten path, and definitely an undiscovered treasure. People who love this beach, love it because it is small,non-touristy, rugged sand, secluded in a lovely neighborhood and a great place to get away from it all. People who dislike it, usually do so for the exact same reasons.\n\n2) Amenities.  Huh? Amenities at a beach you say? Ordinarily, amenities wouldn't be on any list I would make, but these have to be mentioned.  There are public restrooms, showers and lockers!  They are exceedingly well maintained, clean and inviting-(if a public restroom can be inviting, that is.)  There is plenty of parking at the top of the hill and places to lock your bikes.  One note: there are no dogs allowed at this beach.\n\n3) The Views.  There are 105 easy to navigate steps from the trail head to the beach.  Honestly, anyone could traverse these steps with ease, however, if steps are problematic, there is a new concrete lane that winds among the flowers, under the trees to the beach.  The road is not for traffic, but for walkers or bicycles.  From the top to the bottom and beyond, the ocean rumbles and crashes into the rocks, the Golden Gate Bridge stands proudly in the distance and the sheer quiet beauty of it all, is arresting. To the left is a small staircase that is a surfer's break.  I am not a surfer (or swimmer), but I have been told that this is the only place that's really suitable for swimming, if you don't mind cold water and that the waves can be huge. And once again, to mention amenities; there is a small picnic area complete with grills, where you can bar-b-que without a permit, which is ultimately cool.  It's a postcard scene you can't purchase and it's free!  The park closes around 8:30ish p.m.\n\nFor more information and photos about China Beach, please visit my blog at The Noise Beneath the Apple.", "author": "Heather J."}

I informed my boyfriend I was going to search this one final beach for Star Fish while he took a nap in the sun, which didn't last long, because about 2 minutes after I left that makeshift bed on the sand I hit the jackpot.\n\nThere are literally hundreds of Star Fish clinging to the rocks: pink, orange, purple. Absolutely amazing. We've also found if you go to watch the sunset, you can often spot a pod of dolphins jumping just off the coast.\n\nThis beach really is a hidden treasure.", "author": "Carrie W."}

It is a cliffside beach, so maybe that discourages the usual potbellies from sauntering down the steep driveway to its sandy shores. It has a very small beach area, but that has never been an issue when we have went there. That's because it's relatively undiscovered and everyone seems to go to Ocean Beach. Meanwhile, China Beach gets overlooked and that's just the way we all like it, since we like to keep the picturesque views of the GGB and crashing waves against the rocks to ourselves.", "author": "Alex R."}

But, you can purchase a condo for a \"mere\" 800K! \nFrom the street level parking lot, you walk a few feet thru a gated area and there's an engraved granite slab from the 1980's, commemorating the history of this beach as a campsite used by Chinese fisherman during the Gold Rush days.  You get a great view of the ocean from the far west tip of San Francisco, outside and beyond the Golden Gate Bridge.  Across the street in one of the \"monster homes\" is a Swiss flag mounted up front.  Perched on top of high cliffs over the beach are several more multimillion dollar \"monster homes\" with what I can only imagine, breathtaking views.   But, there is a drawback with  the large blackbirds and seagulls surfing the winds adjacent or above the homes.

An ocean view should be everyone's birthright.   Damn it, I'm starting to feel like I need score some justice for Oscar Grant - and I'm not interested in nabbing shoes at the Downtown Oakland Foot Locker...I'm about to put a brick through Robin Williams' window.  Finally, a sign pointing to a public beach soothes my rage.  Hours of reflective glances out into the ocean, examining the crashes of the waves and while considering the incredible properties of light, sand, and water, refreshed my soul and allowed for me to be a kinder, less violent person upon leaving.

This beach, small and surrounded by cliffs, is a great respite from the busy city. Unlike Ocean Beach, where the crash of the waves is overshadowed by the roar of Great Highway traffic, this beach is peaceful, quieter, and rarely crowded. \nThere are great views of Marin and the Golden Gate Bridge, and views of passing freighters makes you realize how gigantic those things really are. The waves are pretty gentle, and so the beach is nice for swimming if you are crazy enough to jump into the muscle-achingly cold water. (People were swimming laps out there today, but don't be fooled: the water is very, very cold.) Also check out the wierd, red old guys sunning themselves on the sun deck. \nI saw several sets of dolphins out there today; they were surfacing and diving right off shore, it was unbelievable. The rocks around also contain plenty of invertebrate life, so if you are into tide-pooling-like activities, check out the rocks. There are sea anemones, crabs, shellfish, and the occasional brightly-colored jellyfish clinging to the sides of the partially submerged rocks. \nAdditional credit for the fact that China Beach is an easy, flat, pleasant bikeride from the Inner Sunset.", "author": "Kathleen B."}
