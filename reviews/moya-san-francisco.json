{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-09-21", "description": "I love payday - who doesn't?! It means I get to indulge on a nice, table for one lunch. There was a new yipster \"all-day\" restaurant that I wanted to check out but they only open for lunch on the weekends. \n\nUmm ok, so plan b? \n\nMy Yelp bookmarks. \n\nI've had Moya bookmarked for years (before they had relocated due to a fire) so it was time to finally knock this bad boy off my list.\n\nSadly, Yelp led me astray on this one and I'm really surprised by all the 5 star reviews for Moya. The food is mediocre at best and the service is cold. It isn't exactly cheap either ($20 lunch w/ no beverage) so it's hard to overlook both missteps. Maybe it's raters' bias because there's so few Ethiopian restaurants in SF?\n\nMoya is a cafe with counter service only and you order at the register from the chalkboard menu which has no listed prices. What's up with NOT listing prices?! But, since I paid with a credit card, Square emailed me an itemized receipt. \n\nI ordered the Doro Wot ($13.50), an Ethiopian Chicken stew that's the national dish of Ethiopia. It comes with yellow lentils, a side salad, chopped tomatoes, and brown rice or injera. Opted for the brown rice with a side of injera (+$2): http://bit.ly/2xqwewt. I received injera instead of the brown rice so I had a huge portion of injera. Not a big problem. \n\nWhile Ethiopian cuisine doesn't have a strong presence in San Francisco, I've tried a handful of Ethiopian places and the food here is weak in comparison. The chicken drumsticks were dry and the spices seemed to be toned down for the American palate. Per their menu, it's suppose to be \"SPICY!\" but it wasn't. It was a scotch over mild. Usually, I'm sweating and my snot runs from the robust Ethiopian spices. Not here.\n\nThe accompanying lentils were undercooked, hard, and flavorless, while the salad dressing was too sour.\n\nThe injera, the spongy, sour flatbread was fine. It had the proper texture and just the right amount of sourness. \n\nI can see why so many people complain about the service at Moya. Granted, it's not some fancy, Michelin starred place but there's a certain amount of courtesy paying customers should receive. \n\nThe staff is not friendly and seem like they don't want to be there. I had called earlier in the day to check if they were serving a particular item that day and the lady I spoke with seemed annoyed that I even called. \n\nThen, while I was waiting for my order, two customers were waiting in line to order and the person cooking who is also the cashier passed by them several times with no sense of urgency and ignoring their presence. Pretty rude IMO...a simple, \"I'll be right with you\" would have been the proper thing to do.\n\nIt's counter service so these things can be overlooked but NOT when customers can only denote a 20%, 25%, or 30% tip when paying with a card (didn't see an option for \"custom tip\") . I always tip but I didn't appreciate being forced to tip a minimum of 20% for a counter service especially since they weren't nice. IMO, more appropriate tip options for counter service is 10%, 15%, and 18%. \n\nCan't say I would recommend Moya to anyone, even for convenience.

We decided to go here after having some beers two blocks away at Cellarmaker and this fit the bill. \n\nI won't lie, I was skeptical when I walked in because I've been to a few Ethiopian restaurants and they usually try to make it a more classy, restaurant feel but this one felt like counter service cooked by a family. Sure, the lady behind the counter isn't the most welcoming but she cooks a mean meal. We ordered a siga tibs (beef) and misir wot (spicy lentils) and it was served in a nice big plate with plenty of injera to share and a fresh green salad in the center. Everything was flavorful and delicious. The food arrived quickly and tasted so good! There's water on the side but they have a few drinks you can buy too. \nOverall, this meal was just under $30 and made us both full and happy. \n\nGluten intolerant folks rejoice! This is real injera bread that is totally gluten-free. Not to mention, delicious and served generously. \n\nNext time I swing by SoMa and eat at Cellarmaker, I'll definitely come back for more.", "author": "Kim L."}

They came with a good heap of decent injera. If it all wasn't savory enough, a side of ayb (Ethiopian cheese made from buttermilk) made it all quite a filling meal shareable between two. \n\nThe venue is compact but reasonably clean and bright, and grabbing a to-go order here was a breeze.

It's more of a caf\u00e9 where you can get work done, but I stopped by for a quick me-time dinner before socializing with friends on a Friday night. The process for ordering is straightforward. There's a simple menu posted above the counter, and you order at the cashier before getting your number and finding a seat.\n\nI decided on the kitfo, which is essentially raw meat with the standard injera and house salad to complement the flavor. The plate is a decent amount of food. Actually, it was much more than I could finish, but it was pretty good! After awhile, I couldn't stomach any more raw meat, so I gave up and called it a day. Initially I wanted tibs, but they only had chicken.\n\nIt's a dimly lit caf\u00e9 and has a very low-key vibe. I saw people come here on a chill date and to catch up with friends.

Succulent steak and a salad with bright green dressing and tomato. I added collard greens and they were delicious. All the better to eat up with the Injera bread. He had the Kitfo, an Ethiopian steak tartare. Too bad they don't serve alcohol here. But a ginger beer washes things down just fine. \n\nI didn't really count but they're probably eight or nine tables, 4- and 2-tops. While the restaurant is clean, the atmosphere is good, not great. A basic look dressed up with some Ethiopian art. Never got crowded but it stayed busy until almost closing time when I was there on a Wednesday night. The woman at the counter was extremely friendly. Nothing to complain about and the price was right at just $14. \n\nDon't get faked out by the out-of-order sign on the bathroom door. I'm pretty sure that's to discourage the vagrants.

It can get chilly at times, but feel free to close the windows.\n\nYou'd think this would be more of a lunch place, but it was decently crowded for dinner on a Saturday night around 7pm.

Jamie W. and I were lucky enough to try the place in its early days, and we really enjoyed the fresh ingredients and cordial service of this Ethiopian eatery (see review below), so we were sad that chef and owner Fana Alemayehu and her three daughters had to close their business and move. Luckily, one year later, they have been able to start over again in a location not that far away - 9th Street near Mission - where they are more likely to get more foot traffic and hopefully Twitter lunch-hour overflow.\n\nI came by alone after work last week. The new space feels a bit smaller and more generic, but they've warmed it up with their native artwork. The takeout menu with the tiny font lists the same appetizing dishes I remembered from their first place with plenty of their gluten-free injera to go around (see photo). Injera is the spongy flatbread that may look like remnants of a yoga mat but is actually handmade from teff with an unusually vinegary flavor. I like it. Since I'm eating less red meat these days, I honed in on the $11.95 Doro Wot, which is a dish consisting of a couple of chicken drumsticks and a hard-boiled egg all slathered in an Ethiopian chili stew.\n\nI usually stay away from chicken-and-egg combos simply because of the implied mother-and-child allusion. Seriously. I just think it's weird to combine poultry at different stages of its life on one plate. But I got over it since it was tasty nicely complemented by a side house salad and the injera (see photo). One interesting twist is that you have to say you want it \"family-style\" if you want the food served more traditionally on the injera fully rolled out on a platter. Otherwise, you get it Western style on a regular plate. On the side, I also went for a $3.95 bowl of Kin-Che, a couscous-like rice with a buttery taste that probably didn't help with my personal curbing of the carbs (see photo).\n\nFana serves sandwiches and stews to go in addition to the mid-priced entrees. The lamb of the Ye Beg Wot appears to be gone from their menu, but they now have chicken breast, steak tartare and tofu options. Listen, she and her family are very nice and obviously close-knit. Friends of theirs came by while I was eating, and you can just tell. You should definitely give Moya a try in their new digs. They obviously went through a lot this past year, and I think it's great they were committed to staying in SoMa instead of moving to the 'burbs where rents are likely cheaper. If you haven't tried Fana's homestyle Ethiopian food, you need to give it a go.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...still the same flavorful, homestyle Ethiopian fare served up before their relocation\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit more fast-foody than before but warmed by their artwork\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...very nice people\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Moya is back and here to stay, I hope", "author": "Ed U."}

Moya is just your quintessential cafe that serves Ethiopian food on the side (or that's how I felt about the establishment)\n\nWe ordered a vegetarian platter family style, to be split between the hubs and I. Along with a bottle of Bundaberg (who can say no to Bundaberg when it's right there!?). And let me tell you, the only thing I thoroughly enjoyed during my meal, was the Bundaberg (and that came at a price too, $6 for a bottle. As you can see, I am still trying to come to terms with paying 2x for everything in the city) \n\nThe food was cold. The yellow peas, the red lentil stew were cold (and lacking flavor), the collard greens tasted a bit bitter than what I am used to. The cabbage/carrot/potato curry was phenomenal and the injera was sour to perfection. Saving grace was the injera. \n\nPrice wise, it was reasonable by SF standards.

The two ladies were super nice and though I felt bad about making them cook for me when no one else was there they seemed unperturbed. I got the ingudai ribs, medium hot, to go with some injera. What wasn't so great was the crazy homeless person outside who asked me for food then blocked the doorway the entire time - not letting me leave. The owner had to call the police to come clear the way. Luckily the guy left on his own and I hustled out. \n\nBy the time I got to work the sauce had spilled out of the the container and made a mess even though it was double-bagged. NOTE: bring your own leak proof container or don't walk very far. Despite all this the ingudai ribs were pretty awesome. There's no other way to describe them. Saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, nicely spicy, pretty spicy in fact. Nom nom nom. The injera is a nicely rolled up round. Perfect for scooping up the ingudai ribs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-09-02", "description": "My friend and I stumbled upon this place by accident while looking for a warm place to duck in for a bit around Market St. She had never had Ethiopian food and it's one of my favorite cuisines so I figured we'd both enjoy Moya.\n\nThe restaurant can be a bit confusing in terms of how you order and are seated. Despite all the people who might be sitting at tables around you, you do have to order your food up front and pay first before seating yourself. The staff will bring out the food to you, but they don't exactly wait on you like in traditional restaurants. It's very cafeteria-style.\n\nWe got the Veggie Sampler (misir wot, kik alicha, gomen, atkiliti wot) and the kitfo. Everything was exceptionally tasty and well-cooked. The kitfo has a definite kick to it that builds as time goes on, so don't order this if you are sensitive to spiciness. Out of all the veggie entrees, I think the gomen was the best. The injera was one of the least \"soggy\"-feeling ones I've ever had but had all of that delicious sourness you expect. I was initially worried that they wouldn't provide enough injera for the two of us, but it turned out to be plenty. In fact, we had more than enough to take home for leftovers. Injera heats up so well in the microwave, because it already has a naturally soggy texture so the moisture from the heat doesn't really affect it.\n\nThe space is very new and sleek 'n' chic, as I like to describe modern aesthetics. And I have to rave about the staff. Some of the nicest people I have ever encountered. They were so warm, welcoming and accommodating to us. They seemed genuinely concerned that we enjoyed the food and went out of their way to make sure everything was to our liking. Very sweet.", "author": "Josephine L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-08-01", "description": "I came here for dinner with my husband and we ordered two veggie samplers. We were led to believe on the menu stuck to the window that each veggie sampler was $9.95. However, when we went in to the cash register, it ended up costing $12.95. \n\nAs a matter of principle, I queried this as it is deceptive and misleading advertising. I was not disputing the price, as the server was arguing with me, but I was asking why they had advertised the incorrect price for the meal. All other restaurants can advertise the correct price on their menu!!\n\nThe server responded that they had just put the wrong menu out, however like I explained, that is not my error. Moya (like all restuarants, cafes, bars, pubs etc) should have the CORRECT price advertised on their menu's, otherwise it is deceptive and misleading to the customer.\n\nMoya, just so you are all aware in the United States, there are state and federal false advertising laws that prohibit various types of deceptive advertising, misleading labeling, and related practices. False advertising laws provide important rights for consumers and competitors, arming them with the ability to seek redress when they've been overcharged unlawfully.\n\nAn advertisement is a message that promotes a product or a service or gives information to the public. Advertisements may take many forms; such as press advertisements in newspapers or magazines, television and radio advertisements or SIGNS and MENUS in SHOPS.\n\nMisleading advertising means advertising that deceives or is likely to deceive anyone that sees it. Misleading advertising may affect consumers' choices regarding what they buy, such as advertising a meal for $9.95 when the amount charged is $12.95. It's worth bearing in mind, that it may be an offence for a trader to advertise good or services if it is likely to mislead and therefore cause loss (financial or otherwise) to the public.\n\nThe server then began arguing that the price was $12.95 so I used an example... would you go to a store and buy a coke advertised for $1.00 then when you go to pay for it, you are charged $2.00? Would you be happy that the incorrect price was advertised? Or would you pay the $2.00 and be happy with the fact you were misled by a false price? When I mentioned this to the server, she became more irate and asked us to leave.......... and  short changing us, we had paid $30 for our two meals and the server refunded $21\n\nClearly being dishonest and unethical is more important than good customer service.\n\nIn summary, Moya;\n\n1. Deceptive and misleading advertising on their menus - prices are incorrect, you need to correct the prices. If a meal is $12.95 it should be $12.95 on the menu and NOT $9.95\n2. Short change people - a refund is the FULL amount. I paid $30 not $21\n3. Unethical business practice and dishonest\n4. No apology was offered, staff were rude\n\nPlease read:\nCalifornia's False Advertising Law and California's Consumers Legal Remedies Act\n\n\nDishonest conduct - shame on you, Moya.", "author": "Alice T."}

I'm ready to go.\n\nLets start with the walk there.  Not knowing the city, I walked down 6th street, bad idea. That was the only street that was \"questionable\" all throughout the city. Saw some interesting \"business\" deals and some colorful characters, but once I got to Folsom, it was fine.  So, I would avoid Market and 6th to 6th and Folsom.\n\nHowever, the food makes up for everything. The food was fantastic, very authentic as well.  No surprise, the chef is the owner and it shows with how much love and dedication is placed into getting it right. The waitress, daughter of the owner, came over and brought us some samples of Injera without gluten and that it's more authentic.

When I googled mapped it, I realized it's only 5 blocks from my house, PERFECT!   So this place gets 4 stars for the 100% teff injera alone!  Mmmmm, it was so good.  So nutty and flavorful compared to regular injera, totally worth the extra $2.  The food tasted very healthy, not oily at all compared with other Ethiopian restaurants I've been to.  \n\nMy husband and I ordered everything vegan!  Here is the review:\n\nVeggie Sampler:  This did not exactly match the online menu.  It came with MISIR WOT (red lentil) which was sooooooooo good, just the right spiciness level for me. And not oily at all! Hooray!  It also had KIK ALI-CHA (yellow pea).  I didn't like this one, it was completely bland, not even a touch of flavor.  My husband liked it .  But i think This one really could have used some extra kick.  GOMEN (collard greens), again, not a ton of flavor.  There was also a potato/carrot dish.  This one is a common dish in all ethiopian restaurants.  It tasted to me like it always does.  There was also a nice little salad with this plate.  Refreshing.  \n\nSuro:  This was a chickpea stew with 15 spices.  It had a great flavor (right in between the lentil and pea dishes in terms of spiciness).  It had a very creamy consistency though. \n\nINGUDAI TIBS:  Mushrooms. The kind waitress brought this dish out for free when she saw how much we were enjoying the food.  This had an excellent flavor!  A good kick to it with the jalape\u00f1o.  It was really good. \n\nI think they could do a bit better job on the decor.  They are in a brand new building, and the whole place just felt a little too sterile and new.  \n\nI wish they had an Ocra dish on the menu, but they're a small shop, so I understand that they have to draw the line somewhere.\n\nI'll be back for sure!!!

So beware.\n\nNever write a review while hungry. Here I am, stomach grumbling, drooling on the keyboard--\n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered two dishes for dinner on a Wednesday evening: one with sauteed mushrooms, and one with chicken drumsticks and an egg. Both dishes, as well as their accompanying side salads, arrived on a large, injera-lined platter. The mushrooms were very juicy and tasted fresh. The chicken drumsticks were tender, and the spice had permeated the meat to give it a delicious flavor. We switched between using the injera and our forks to transport bite after bite into our hungry mouths. When the main dishes were done, we couldn't help but pick at the injera on the platter that had soaked up all the yummy juices from the mushrooms and chicken.\n\nYou can read and imagine, but it's nothing like going to Moya and experiencing it for yourself.

We wanted to order this beef dish and the lady who worked there (who was the cashier, cook, waitress) asked us if we have had Ethiopian before and when we said yes asked if we had that dish before.  Recommended that we tried another beef dish, because she explained that this dish takes some \"getting used to\" and to be safe if we wanted to enjoy our dinner should order something \"safer\".  That works for me, much appreciated that she points this out dispute how busy she was cooking and doing all of these things at once.\n\nWe went with that and the mushrooms, and it was all very delicious.  The thing with Ethiopian food to me is, I can't have that much.  But that results in an unhappy tummy, who wants more food.  Well that's what happened after finishing our meal, we were still hungry.  We ordered two entrees, normally we would be full so we came to the conclusion that portions were on the smaller side and for each entree to be about $10+ for a cafe this is on the pricier side.

My first time trying Ethiopian food and I am in love now. The ambience fits perfectly with its location (downtown S.F. industrial). The staff is very friendly and the place is surprisingly very spacious. We came in just before the lunch rush hour so we got our food in a timely manner. \n\nI had the Ingudai Doro Tibs platter extra spicy and it was amazing. The injera (ethiopian bread) has a very interesting texture almost spongy but I quite enjoyed it. I do regret not ordering the veggie sampler that everyone talks about. \n\nTheir lunch menu is one page which is very fitting because I hate restaurants with menus the size of a short novel.

The kitfo was amazing, and they have mushrooms here, which have been a little hard for me to find. The portions were ridiculous -- we spent about $20 per person and didn't even come close to finishing what we ordered.\n\nMy only complaints are that they don't serve beer or honey wine, and that the mushrooms which we ordered medium were not even the least bit spicy. Considering that there was a person at my table who seemed hesitant about the spiciness, that may have been our server acting a little too cautious.\n\nAnd speaking of our server, she was fantastic. I've learned not to judge an Ethiopian restaurant by the attentiveness of their waitstaff, but our server kept our water refilled and brought us extra napkins and injera without us having to ask.

I had eaten it a few times and wasn't taken seriously when I said you eat it with your hands.\n\nWell, um: ya do. You tear off a piece of injera (a bread with a very sponge-like consistency), wrap it around some food, and chow away.\n\nWe ordered a variety of items consisting of the tofu tibs, ye doro tibs (chicken), vegetarian combo, and one of the beef items (sorry, the name escapes me).\n\nEven though the place was almost empty when we were there, it took about 15 minutes to get the food prepared. When it arrived, it was served on a single, giant platter. It took up almost the entire table. In addition to what we had ordered, they threw on a couple of samples other menu items. The place was clearly very new, so the staff probably hasn't had time to work out the kinks of running the place yet.\n\nPortion size: excellent. The four of us left feeling stuffed. And this is a fairly active group of people, accustomed to burning a lot of calories.\n\nService: It took it awhile, but the waitress was very friendly and quite knowledgeable about the details of menu items and of Ethiopian cuisine in general. So, \"very good.\"\n\nValue: Considering the quantity of food, it's very good.\n\nDrawbacks: \n\n1) the prices were a bit high for lunch (average entree was about $13). Since they seem to want to attract a noontime crowd, they need to have prices that are appealing. Note: their website indicates that they have \"lunch specials\" now, so perhaps that's since been remedied.\n\n2) Because you eat this food with your hands, they need to provide tableside hand-cleaning both BEFORE and AFTER you eat. Perhaps some warm, wet towels or something. And yes, I know: there is a restroom in the back, but if the place gets busy, there's going to be a crowd waiting for it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-07-31", "description": "I am still getting my Ethiopian-food legs, so to speak, and I learned a lot from my dinner at Moya. \n\nAs much as I loved it, after we ate at New Eritrea, I was going to give myself a long break from Ethiopean food. It just didn't seem right to eat it without having the full experience -- by which I mean the injera -- and nobody in San Francisco was making injera with 100% teff. But then Moya came along. \n\nTimes are hard in Africa, especially hard right now, and there is a severe teff shortage. Teff is an impressively tiny grain grown in Africa that is dark brown in color, sour-flavored, a bit gummy when cooked, and is the basis for traditional injera. You can still buy teff in America -- at a price. Most restaurants are keeping their costs down by cutting their teff with wheat, which is great for the budget but frustrating for folks with gluten allergies. Moya, instead, makes two kinds of injera -- one with wheat, and one without. They charge a little more for the teff-only version, which is brilliant. I wish other Ethiopean places would do this. \n\nSo, I decided to reverse my moratorium on Ethiopean food and give Moya a try. My date and I visited on a Friday evening; the restaurant had a few diners but wasn't packed. The decor is more cafe than African, though it is clean and feels friendly. We were encouraged to sit anywhere, and urged to try the ye beg wot, a tender lamb dish that had just come out of the pot and was getting rave reviews from other diners. I ordered it, while my date braved the ultra-rare kitfo. I also explained that I am allergic to gluten, and ordered the teff-only injera for my meal. \n\nMy date ordered the azifa, and I had a taste of the zesty lentils before he began spooning them onto pieces of flatbread (wheat-based, so I couldn't have it). His kitfo came out soon after, along with a plate with a couple of extra rolls of injera. The woman who brought the food set the injera down next to me, so I assumed it was mine. Excited to try it, I took a bite. \n\nA few minutes later, my food came out -- and I noticed the injera on my plate was much darker than the stuff I'd just eaten. It tasted different, too; more like pure teff. Uh oh. I talked with the woman who'd served our food, and she confirmed that the injera I'd tried earlier had wheat in it. She claimed she told us that it was my date's, not mine, but admitted it was confusing that she had set it in front of me. They agreed to knock the cost of my injera off the order, and I wondered if that would make up for the allergic reaction I might have later. \n\nNevertheless, the lamb was amazing. The meat was tender and rich, complemented by the light sourness of the injera. The sauce was buttery and spicy, also a perfect foil for the bread. I would have loved more salad, and was surprised by how quickly I was filled by the meal. I had enough to take home and enjoy for lunch the next day. My date liked his kitfo even more than my lamb. \n\nI didn't wind up having a truly bad reaction to the bite of wheat I got, though I did feel crummy for a couple of days after. Plus, I learned how to tell the difference between the wheat-laced injera and the stuff that's safe for me to eat, so I would feel comfortable going back. \n\nI'm docking one star for the allergy-related confusion, and reluctantly docking one more because I wish they had a wine selection to go with the food -- Ethiopean honey wine, at the very least.", "author": "Beth W."}

Five dishes  spooned on Teff - a nutritious Ethiopian grain..Wiki tells it. gluten-free, injera bread.  The salad was simply chopped toms and lettuce but dusted with white pepper - usually pet hate of mine, but..it worked, I was converted; a stew of carrots kale; slow cooked collard greens; yellow split peas in garlic & spices and split red lentils in Berbere sauce.  I also called ahead (obsessive planning!..but they ask for 30mins notice) to get them whipping up some Shuro (ground garbanzos cooked in garlic & Berbere sauce).  Vegansaurus said to order it and slather it on everything as it was like liquid butter... \n\nThe injera was good..perfect in fact.  A texture like nothing else.  The palate of dishes in the veggie combo?  I enjoyed the salad..actually I enjoyed EVERYTHING.  The red split lentils were worthy of a trumpeted fanfare and mini indoor sparklers..yey!  The other dishes were good but my socks were not blown off, tic-a-tape did not rain from the sky and I did not  take to the floor to perform three somersaults, air straddle splits and a triple salto in celebration.

I ordered the veggie sampler lunch and the portion of lentils, potatoes and salad was really huge.

Having just returned from a trip to Ethiopia, I was excited when a friend asked me to do lunch at a local Ethiopian cafe. I saw on their website that they offer macchiato, which got me really excited. \nUnfortunately, their machine was broken and the only alternative was just a drip coffee they had made. Bummer. \nAlso, the portion of injera that goes along with lunch was a little too small and an extra order costs $2 bucks. As a redeeming factor, however, the staff was extremely friendly (I expect no less from Ethiopians!) and she ended up giving it to us for free.\nAmasegenalu!! \n\nPS: if anyone out there who is a big fan of Ethiopian food has managed to find fruit \"spreece\" or salad \"atakelt\", please let me know!!

I've been waiting for them to open for a while, as I live nearby.  I've been a fan of Ethiopian for a long time and was hoping they'd be at least a solid neighborhood option.\n\nTonight was my first visit and I'll be going back - and not just because it is convenient.  We had two dishes - the Ye Doro Wot (#25) - which is a chicken dish consisting of two drumsticks braised in a rich, dark sauce and the Kifto (#18), a fairly standard Ethiopian classic you can find most places.\n\nBoth were good and at different ends of the spice spectrum.  The ye do wot was our favorite of the two.  The meat was falling off the bone (in the best possible way) and came with a mild, gravy-like sauce and a hard-boiled egg. It reminded us of a mole - with complex, deep rich flavors.\n\nWe ordered the classic kifto the way they like to serve it - rare.  It was fairly spicy, but adding a little ayb (the cottage cheese served on the side) cut the spice nicely.  This was a solid dish, but I'll try the two other versions of kifto on the menu on future visits to figure out which is my favorite.\n\nThey topped of the meal with a few of the delicious Italian cookies from the nearby Dolce Italia cookie company (wholesale only at the moment, it appears.)  These were excellent!\n\nI really liked Moya and have hopes of it being a lasting addition to the neighborhood.  They stated they are hoping to set up a traditional Ethiopian coffee station in the near future, which should be awesome.  \n\nService was great - the owner's daughter waited on us and spent time telling us about the plans for the restaurant (all of which sound exciting.)  We met the owner as well - she was hard at work in the kitchen, but took time to say goodbye to us, which was nice!  \n\nThey lack a wine/beer permit at the moment, so there isn't much to cut the spiciness of the food (I'd love a beer!)  Its just starting, but it is off to a promising start in a neighborhood that has seen a plethora of great new places open.  If you're in this part of SOMA, it is worth a shot (and a great  value - entrees are about $15 each and are quite generous - well worth it!)", "author": "Dave H."}

They will give you utensils if you ask but that is half the fun. They also keep the amazing injeera coming as much as you need and the staff are attentive. \n\nThe pleasant waitress (owner?) warned us that the Kittfo and Ye Doro Wat were quite spicy (not always good at lunch) so we tried the Vegi Combo and Ye Bere Tibs (Beef in mildly spicy bere bere sauce) which were very good. In retrospect though I bet this was kind of an American palette \"gringo spicy\" so I am game to go back and try those since they were among my favorite dishes in Ethiopia. \n\nI liked this place even better than the other two Ethiopian places I have tried in SF (Assab on Geary and a different place on Irving).

Their menu boasts plenty of veggie options, the staples of any good Ethiopian place -- a veggie combo and shuro, and even a tofu dish! I ordered the veggie combo (vegan) with my date, and we both left full. I look forward to coming back again and trying the shuro and appetizers!\n\nService was super friendly, food tasty (misir wot was my favorite) and  prices very reasonable! Good injera and being open for lunch earns them bonus points.

Eating with hands is always fun.\n\nMoya is the new kid on the block, and doing pretty well. Their food is solid and just as good as Ethiopian anywhere. It lacks a little bit in unique atmosphere. Most locally owned ethnic restaurants try to play to their unique flavor and culture of origin, but this one tries to have a clean feel instead of an ethnic feel. It's an interesting choice that might make it more business suit oriented, but makes it a lot less of a fun experience than a place with the short tables and different feel of a place that takes you out of the American mindset for your meal.\n\nThe service was great, we got a table right on arrival and drinks served immediately. Food service took 11 minutes for salads and another 5 for dinner. the salads were interesting, served on the flatbread, but consisting of chopped and dressed romaine, there was no good way to eat the salads and they didn't really go with the flatbread for eating the rest of the meal. the food and flatbread were good, and the price was reasonable.\n\nWill I return, possibly, but I'll go for the food alone, not for the experience of something very different.", "author": "Matthew R."}

We've been to at least 6 different restaurants in the south bay and San Francisco, and Moya is hands down the best Ethiopian place in SF. Our other favorite places are Zeni and Rehoboth (both in San Jose). \n\nThe other Ethiopian places in San Francisco are a little off. Sheba Piano Lounge has decent flavors, but it's loud, the portions are small, and it doesn't feel authentic. Assab Eritrean is a good introduction to Ethiopian food, but the food lacks the depth of flavors and spices.\n\nMoya is great. We usually get the kitfo (ground beef) raw, extra spicy, and it never disappoints. The veggie combo is also very good, and it seems to be improving every time we go. I'm guessing as they've become more popular, the veggie dishes (especially the bean-based ones) are fresher and less dry. \n\nEverything else we've tried is also very good -- ye beg tibs (lamb stew), shuro (finely-pureed chickpea), ye timatim selata (shreded bread in dressing), ye beg wot (another lamb stew) -- although I wish the ye timatim selata were a little more lemon-y.\n\nHope more people find this place, but not too many more people; I don't want to wait for a table.", "author": "Peter D."}

Messer wot (red lentils) was incredibly bland, with undercooked lentils, and had no discernible spice to it. Also, maybe I'm mistaken, but it seemed like they didn't use any nitir kibe (spiced clarified butter) in the veggie dishes. The injera (which they charge extra for if you want it served like a normal Ethiopian meal) was stale. Great that it's made out of 100% teff, shame it isn't any good. The lentil salad was just awful. Undercooked dry lentils, hardly any flavor, served on stale sliced bread.\n\nService is barely existent, you order at the counter, get your own water and napkins. I don't mind this approach, but when a veggie combo that was clearly cooked way earlier in the day and slopped out onto a plate is $17, the place is in a shitty neighborhood, and the decor looks like your average nobody-cares-independent-coffeeshop, it's outrageous.\n\nOh, and no honey wine or Ethiopian beers, although I would assume they're working on that.\n\nIf you rated this place well you really should check out Enssaro, Cafe Eritrea de Afrique, or any of the other well reviewed Ethiopian/Eritrean spots in Oakland. Unless this was the off-est of off-nights, you won't want to eat at Moya anymore.", "author": "YUP K."}

It's surprisingly hard to find Ethiopian food near the Fidi, and even harder to find places that aren't dinner-only.  They offer a lunch special for about $9 (can't remember the exact price, maybe $8.45, but don't quote me on that) where you pick 3 of the 4 items in the vegetarian combo.  It's not on the menu, but just ask them about the special.  3 of us shared that and the first of the two lamb dishes on the menu, (although I didn't have any of that since I'm a vegetarian, but they said it was good) and we were full and still had a tiny bit left over.  Everything tasted great!\n\nThe negatives:  almost every place has it's down-side, and here it is.  The injera was kind of cold (I saw the chef making it, so I know it's home-made, but she was making it in very large quantities, and they just grabbed our pieces off of a huge stack), and they don't have honey wine.\n\nOtherwise, great in every other way!", "author": "Rachael S."}

Got menus and water quickly, pleasant server. Ordered coffees all around and our meals fairly quickly. Waited until 2 reminders to get coffee, another 5 minutes for cream (which turned the watery brew to NOT MUCH). The food served family style, so we requested separate plates to divide since all were not beef-eaters. The dishes were all tasty and the injera, served in 1/3  rollups, kept coming. We ate all the food. First time we weren't served enough to satiate our collective appetites! Friendly but inept service, portions not generous at the prices.

We came in and were seated promptly and the service was fine.\n\nThe bad: after waiting 40 minutes for our food despite the fact that the resturant was nearly empty, we find that all of our dishes are lukewarm at best. I ordered the veggie combo, as I always do at ethopian places, and my date ordered a rare beef dish that the waitress reccomended. Too bad all of our dishes were practically cold by the time they got to our table! Even looking past that it was luke-warm, the flavor wasn't there. I can't recommend the food based on our experience. There's other good options for Ethiopian like Assab in SF, and even better options in the east bay which you can check out if you've got a craving for it.", "author": "Max L."}

I never do that(!!!)...\n\n...but I desperately wanted to try more of the vegetarian options.  Yesterday I had the vegetable combo which allows you to try three dishes at once and my friend got the tofu tibs which I got to taste, so today I got the inguday tibs.  I definitely like the taste of the two tibs dishes best.  Today I decided not to order the lunch portion, but rather the full portion, and I ate it all!\n\nYesterday I got the teff-only injera and wasn't a big fan, ended up using most of my normal injera that was under my food.  Today she offered my friend a taste of the teff-only which I thought was nice.  But then she offered me a piece too saying that it turned out better than the one I had had yesterday.  I think she's right, it was fluffier, but I didn't really like knowing that I had paid for less than excellent quality yesterday.  I'd say I prefer the normal injera better because it's thinner and less tangy so you get to fully enjoy the flavors of the actual dishes you ordered.  You also end up filling up less on \"carbs.\"  \n\nBut I like this place, the staff are very friendly, and I like that there are no lines during peak lunch hour.  Definitely give it a try!  I'm going back again soon to try the shuro - would've today but for the 30min notice required.  =)", "author": "Q E."}

Like many who have discovered this treasure, I have gluten-intolerance which makes eating out more difficult than it used to be. I was near tears when I found out about the 100%-teff injera. \n\nI have enjoyed each dish I've tried here. I even like the salad with the injera, but I can understand why some diners would prefer a fork for that part of the meal. \n\nTonight I'm taking two friends there for the first time in celebration of their recent wedding. Everyone I have turned on to Moya has loved it. Yes, I agree, the atmosphere is not the main attraction. However, I find that the fun of eating with our hands from a colorful shared platter more than compensates for a lack of decor. \n\nI always end an evening of dining at Moya full and content and feeling good about how healthy and clean the food is.

Then the waitress poured the beef dish on the big plate with the other person's order, I rescued my chicken from the same fate. A REAL STRICT VEGETARIAN WOULD HAVE CRAPPED IN THEIR PANTS BY NOW..\nWe ordered coffee when we came in. The waitress had to be reminded we wanted it NOW. It arrived in a small cup. After asking for the coffee three times, and then the cream repeatedly, when another worker, not our waitress, brought it to us, MY COFFEE WAS COLD.

We had the Lentils and one of the chicken entrees, along with a generous helping of the injera bread.  Great new and interesting ethnic flavors.\n\nThe only thing holding back a five-star rating is the ambiance/decor.  As an Ethiopian restaurant, I would expect a lot more African-inspired vibrant color and music.  Right now, it's a newly renovated, perfectly clean, pleasant but somewhat \"beige\" environment.  I don't want to judge too harshly - they're new and probably want to get into a groove before they start livening up the place.\n\nThe staff is very friendly (we met the owner's daughter), and we're happy to have this establishment in our community.
