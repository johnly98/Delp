Why did I make this choice? Well my good friend \"Shayla B\" suggested I change things up a bit, so I did. I honestly am glad I didn't choose this spot as a \"milestone\" as I feel it wasn't..\"special\" it was just okay. But I'm glad that I did finally get to come and see what this place was about. The buzz about this place from the opinions of others in the \"Yelpire\" have been pretty mixed. Now it's my turn to tell you how I felt about \"The Crab Station\"\n\nTuesday April 3, 2018\nLocation: The Crab Station, San Francisco Can\nPeople: 1 Adult\n\nStory:\nI been trying to knock out my bookmarks one by one. I was in the mood for something different. It was a nice sunny day out in SF and I was walking along all the piers. I was passing by a lot of places I had my eye on, but nothing really stood out to me. I decided to look through my bookmarks as I was on my stroll, the funny part of it all is \"The Crab Station\" was highlighted by \"Yelp\" this day and I was thinking about this establishment. Call it \"Devine Intervention\" I made up my mind and set off.\n\nService/Hospitality:\nThe service here was honestly pretty standard. I was greeted and allowed to look at the menu for a bit. Later when I got my food one of the workers helped bring my food to the seating area which I thought was cool. Nothing else to mention during this whole interaction.\n\nFood/Cleanliness:\nThe counter/food area was tidy and presentable, I felt okay about ordering here. The small seating area could of used a slight more attention to detail though. It was pretty cramped and they wasn't quick to clear out trays and such from other visitors. This area could of used some work, but now let's talk about the food. I of course wanted the star of the show \"The Lobster Roll\" $22.95 and with the delicious smells and look of the \"Calamari\" $12.21 and a Kiwi Strawberry Snapple $4.00, I pretty much had what seemed to be the popular options, here is what I thought..\n\nLobster Roll - I like this, I wasn't in love with it honestly. Basically this is lobster salad with 2 claws split and put on the top of the roll. A hell of a lot of mayo was used in making this, but the flavor was present. I wasn't a fan of the roll used as I would of liked a French Roll and felt it would of been better. I ate this and felt it wasn't fully worth the price, maybe perhaps a few dollars cheaper would of been more worth it. Also slightly less mayo so more of the lobster could of been more front and center. I would still get this again.\n\nCalamari - I wasn't blown away with this nither. It was just okay at best. I liked the little pieces with the tentacles as it was less chewy and more flavorful than the actual rings. I opted for the full plate and ditched the fries for a slight upcharge and the portion was good. It was nicely battered and not super greasy. I would say this is a to each is their own kinda thing. I would skip this unless I could get all the little tentacle pieces.\n\nSnapple - Kiwi Strawberry, if you've had it.... it's just juice.\n\nOverall:\nThis is a family decent establishment with some fresh seafood offerings. The prices are pretty competitive and what better than eating a \"Lobster Roll\" in \"San Francisco\" it just has that authentic feeling especially considering it's in a touristy area and the SF air adding that beach like quality to the experience. I would visit again, but not before visiting a competitor for a little compare and contrast.", "author": "Tre S."}

The lobster roll is super loaded however it's not served on the big buttered toast I'm used to from other places I've had lobster rolls from in the peninsula. I will say the lobster roll is a great value since so far it's the cheapest (and most loaded) lobster roll I've tried in the Bay Area. The clam chowder is also pretty good! You will order either at the sidewalk cart outside or in the small seating area inside. This has seating in in a small storefront and service is pretty good as they will serve you your food to  your table.

I decided to go with the chowder to since a lot of people suggested it.\n\nIt was definitely good, but I didn't think that it stood out as amazing/SF unique compared to other chowders that I had. I got a breadbowl, and it came out to be around $9 + tax.\n\nNo seating since this is just a food stand essentially, but if you walk closer to the waters, there's a bunch of picnic style benches/tables by the arcade - just beware of the seagulls!", "author": "Daniel Z."}

Depending on what time you go, it can get packed quickly. I enjoyed the fried shrimp but it was a bit light on the seasoning. It didn't taste all that fresh either, it may have been sitting there for awhile. Their clam chowder was good, it was flavorful.

Now, I had heard tales of the stands just past the \"touristy pier\"... pier 39... that sold fresh crab they'd boil in pots, right there on the street, Lobster rolls, clam chowder in sour dough bowls, and plenty of fried seafood. \nI had to try it!\nAfter seeing all we could possibly see in one day, we headed towards the boiling pots of crab! Ok, sooooo now that I know and have been informed that the lobster here isn't fresh west coast hahahhaa but that the crab is... I definitely feel I should have tried the crab rather than the lobster roll...oh well, next time for sure!\nSpeaking on what I did order, the lobster roll was actually pretty darn fantastic in my book! We ordered a Lobster Roll, Clam Chowder in Sourdough and fried Calamari.\nWowZa. The lobster roll was what appeared to be a mixture of a fresh crab and lobster, (so I think I did get my crab) topped with huge chunks of lobster meat. I asked for melted butter and lemon. It came on a sourdough roll which I LOVE sourdough.\nThe calamari were HUGE, and tasted super fresh and not rubbery at all. Idk where they get their calamari but it's beautiful. The clam chowder was good. I think it could have been thicker..but hubby loved it. Finnally the portions are HUGE! You get a ton of food so be prepared to eat!\nWe sat at a table, under the stars on the street and people watched for awhile, eating happily and then left the city for home. I actually can't wait to go back and get another Lobster Roll, and this time try the crab, this place rocked our socks.", "author": "Stephanie G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-02-27", "description": "Visited touristy Fishermen's Wharf and based on a fair amount of Google reviews I thought that The Crab Station would be a decent spot along the wharf for a Lobster Roll. \n\nKeep in mind that every single vendor out there sells pre-made lobster rolls. They are all sitting in chilled display cases.  Note, I've never had a lobster roll before so this is the closest to it without traveling to the New England. \n\nThe roll came to almost $23 with a can of soda. After I paid the cashier he took a roll out of their cold case. They had about 10 already made. \n\n1) The roll is cold, a bit hard. It is sour dough. Not toasted. \n2) The roll was loaded with claw meat and other body meats mixed with a heavy mayo sauce?\n3) Takes a lot of chewing to the point where my jaw was tired. Thankfully I ordered a Coke to down each bite.\n4) Seating is limited. I ordered outside where they boil their crabs. They have some seats right inside. The tables were dirty and not wiped. I cleaned the table myself. \n\nYeah it was quite disappointing first experience. The roll wasn't disgusting but not something I would pay or order again, especially at $20 for a sandwich.", "author": "Robert N."}

The setup is a little confusing if you're not used to it but I got my teeny, tiny container of crab and found a place to seat nearby (no seating inside here). The big chunks on top tasted great but when I got to the more shredded (for lack of a better term) crab meat underneath, it was...not so great.

Even though I'm from San Jose, I find myself always wanting a bowl of clam chowder whenever I'm at the pier.  I tend to venture out to different places to eat per my bookmarks.  I have over 1,500 of them so I must take that into consideration when I do dine out so I can a) create new experiences, b) try a new place, c) write a review, and d) see if the place has potential to bring me back.  \n\nLike I mentioned in my other review, my boyfriend's brother doesn't know much about other cuisines because he only knows the basic American and not much of a seafood person.  I told him that he needs to try at least one spoon because San Francisco is known for their clam chowder in a bread bowl.  BTW- per my hospitality teacher, there is something about the air in San Francisco that contributes greatly to the taste and production of the sourdough bread.  \n\nI got 1 clam chowder in a bread bowl (he only ate 1 spoon, i ate the rest), 1 order of crab cake (comes w/ fries), an order of fries (for the boy), a beer (for the boyfriend), and a bottled water (for the brother).  The clam chowder was of course exquisite as usual.. creamy.. thick and not full of potatoes!  The sourdough was AWESOME.  If it weren't for the carbs content, I would have finished the bread bowl itself.  The crab cake was crispy, small, not flaky, not battery... very good but I wish there was more crab.  \n\nWhen you're in the city and space is scarce.. buy something and enjoy it on the street.  It is seriously the best way to eat.. whilst walking so I can burn calories and consume calories simultaneously.  \n\nHaha.", "author": "Tram N."}

I walked over to Fisherman's Wharf and browsed through the food stands/vendors.  Most of the stands had pretty much the same food.  The prices were exactly the same as well.  Only thing that stood different from them was the nationality of the workers for each stand.  There was a seafood stand that had Chinese workers, a seafood stand that had Mexican workers, and a seafood stand that had Caucasian workers, etc.  I opted for the stand with Chinese workers, in which case, it's \"The Crab Station\".  It's not because I'm Chinese (well, I am) and wanting to support my people, but because you can eat inside their place where it's warm and cozy.  The other stands do have somewhat a place to eat, but it's out in the open, where it's cold and limited in seating.\n\nI ordered a clam chowder in a bread bowl (Yes, I wanted it again) and fried calamari & shrimp.

It was a very plain meal, but it was extremely delicious.  I had 6 bowls of soup, and for the next 6 hours, I felt like dying.  From that point on, the smell of any cream-based soups made me nauseous, and when I tried eating cream of broccoli or clam chowder, I felt like gagging.\n\nFast-forward 4 years and I'm living in San Francisco, land of the clam chowder.  Until this point in my life, I'd managed to do a good job of staying away from any creamy soup.  But then Boyfriend and I decided to play tourist at Pier 39 one gorgeous, warm, sunny Sunday, and all he really wanted was a bowl of clam chowder in a bread bowl at Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nHesitant, I told him that if he could beat me in a best-of-3 SkeeBall competition, he could pick the lunch spot and I would pay.  If I won, I'd get to choose and he'd have to foot the bill.  I ended up winning both games, but I still let him choose lunch (he actually had to pay, since I had like two dollars on me), so he picked the Crab Station.  Since he wanted the clam chowder, I went for the calamari & chips so he could have some.  I wanted to be brave and just go for the clam chowder, but I decided that Boyfriend wouldn't really want to be puked on.\n\nThe calimari came out piping hot atop a mound of fries.  In addition to the fat squid rings, there were also little baby octopus (yum!), and it was served with some marinara sauce.  It was a big order that took one and a half bowls to contain everything.\n\nSurprisingly, I didn't hurl after tasting the clam chowder.  It was a lot less thick and sweet-creamy than the ones from the can or other restaurants, and it was actually really good, with a perfect chunk-to-broth ratio.

I wouldn't say the food was the tastiest, but it was good. It may simply be that fresh and authentic food is less tasty than processed food because of the salt and sugar content. The experience as a whole, however, will never be forgotten. I'd say it is something you have to do when you go to visit San Francisco.\n\nMy son wanted a whole crab and, although I knew it would be expensive, there was no way I was going to deny him the experience. He is only 9 and he loved picking the crab apart. He had watched YouTube videos on how to disect the crabs prior to our vacation, so to watch him actually get to do it was fun. I got the clam chowder bread bowl and I too was happier with the experience than I was with the food. Honestly, I find the clam chowder bread bowl at Souplantation to be tastier, but then again, that may be because it is processed food at Souplantation\n\nWe ate our food at a public table and we had to deal with the low flying sea gulls that were waiting for us to either discard our food or to be in-attentive to it. Once again, this was a part of the fun. My son and I kept saying \"mine, mine, mine\" like in the movie \"Finding Nemo\".

Nestled in between a few other food stalls, down the street from the Boudin Bakery and parking lot, this gem serves up some tasty clam chowder (which I think is served in a Boudin bread bowl) for only $5.50, which is almost half the price of the other restaurants around. \n\nIt doesn't stop with the chowder though. Order up a whole crab (I got two last time for $12 & $13 each) and watch the master cracker break down your freshly steamed crab, then assemble it all on a plate for you with some lemons, a zesty, horseradish laden cocktail sauce and a crapload of napkins. The crabs tasted amazing and if you have any bread left from the bread bowl, use it to mop up the tasty roe that's left pooled up in your crab shell. \n\nFor me, this is what SF seafood on the wharf is all about. Another great thing about this place is that you might be lucky enough to find a table or some chairs inside their restaurant (which is pretty cozy). The best seat in the house is the counter on the window facing out towards the street and the stalls. From there you can pig out on crab, listen to the constant cracking sound of crab shells being artfully broken and watch the pigeons greedily eyeballing the tourists food.

I didn't mind that though.\n\nThe clam chowder was tasty. The sourdough bread is what really makes it though. That is INCREDIBLE. Totally worth it.\n\nWe were adviced to get a crab roll. I'm unsure what I was expecting- but I know it wasn't this. It was crab mixed with TONS OF MAYO. I was unable to eat it. It just tasted incredibly bland. I would skip on the roles and go straight for the chowder.\n\nThere might be better- but my body refused to try every single stand to find out.", "author": "Katherine C."}

For more information on Taiwan's night markets: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_markets_in_Taiwan.\n\nWhile Bella is away a troupe of five grotesque foreigners move in on our table.  Without a mere acknowledgement of my existence the two women sit while the men stand.  All begin shoving their grubby paws into various boxes of seafood and cramming the food into their faces.  One blonde haired woman ate as sloppily as a wild boar, talking loudly and spraying food chunks across what was -- \"our table\".  The wild boar and a male companion keep eyeing the backpack that is reserving Bella's seat.  One grubby paw touches it and I'm -- \"getting medieval on their asses\".  \n\nI realize that this is communal dining but one iota of common courtesy would be greatly appreciated.  Bella returns and is clearly not a fan of the foreigner troupe blocking her from reaching her seat.  She forces her way in, throwing those skinny pointy elbows and sets the food on the table.  I slide one of our boxes of food, slamming it into their box of food in order to clear some room for us to eat.  The fried calamari was UN-BE-LIEV-ABLE.  You won't find it this good at four and five star restaurants.  It is tender, plump and delicious.  The crab is pretty tasty as well.

It's everything you'd expect from a streetside stand, so I am not even going to consider complaining about cleanliness, decor, facilities, etc.  Let's talk food!  I had the clam chowder in a sourdough boule - AMAZING!  and for less than six bucks, this huge serving is WELL worth it!  I also had a shrimp cocktail.   This was quite good (how can you screw up a plain shrimp cocktail?)   Extra points for friendly staff and lightning fast service!  They have cans of beer, too!\" - Dirkie\n\n\"Being partial to our friends of the sea, it turned my stomach to see them being prepared.  However, the food was pretty extraordinary.  The best clam chowder I've had in a very long time.  The bread for the boule was a very good, traditional San Franciscan sourdough.  A MUST for anyone who is visiting The City!

Looked and tasted like old frozen shrimp.  :(    I didn't try it, but the seafood sandwich looked disturbingly GROSS.  As if it would give you days of the shitskis.", "author": "Nicole G."}

The crab cake was OK, but I don't have anything to compare it to. For the price, it was a really good value on the Wharf.", "author": "Brandy G."}

Anyways.. the service is not quite as friendly as the Vietnamese dude over at Sabella but it sure beats the lazy guy over at Guardino's. At least the guy here took his time to wipe my pint of clam chowder after he made a mess w/ scooping it. He even used TWO paper trays! One while scooping, and a brand new one to put in my paper bag w/ the pint of chowder! He gave me 2 spoons, TWO bags of oyster crackers and multiple napkins! WOW! All that for $7!! LOL. Not cheap, but it sure beats that small little cup for what?? Over $5 at Guardino's? Now the chowder itself was not as good as the canned ones at Guardino's, but it wasn't bad. It was actually very tasty, but a bit on the salty side. I might be back to try their crab cocktails though, because I saw some BIG chunks of crab on top of the mini chunks, unlike Sabella's.", "author": "Elaine H."}

Had the clam chowder that was salty and had few clam pieces. Fish and chips were good. I'd say better than Long John Silver but still not worth the parking and Calories. Prices were the same or more expensive than the neighboring stands.", "author": "Helen H."}

I can only think of 2 times that I got crab from somewhere else.   Maybe it's because it's the only spot with a seat - that you don't have to order from the inside restaruant ( granted if it starts getting full i'm taking this review off =) )", "author": "Joey N."}
