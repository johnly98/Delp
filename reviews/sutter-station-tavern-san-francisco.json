I was charged for a drink I didn't order. When I confronted the bartender as I'm closing my tab out, the owner says I'm wrong and I or my friends ordered the drink. I assured her it must have been a mistake and she preceded to call the bartender that served me to prove that I did order the drink ... having a back and forth argument over 10$...what kind of bar owner does that? Even after she finally decided to give me my money back - FOR THE DRINK I DIDNT ORDER OR DRINK - she kept trying to prove a point that I or a friend ordered the drink and her bartenders never make mistakes. \nSuch a horrible experience... DO NOT GO HERE. Sad part is my office just moved across the street and we're looking for a divey cheap bar in the area for happy hours. DEFINITELY, won't be this spot.", "author": "Alina B."}

We decided to go to Sutter Station on Wednesday, September 12th around 6pm. It was pretty crowded when we arrived, but after waiting around for a little bit, we managed to find two seats at the bar.\n\n*Pear vodka w/soda ($5) x2\n*Jameson irish whiskey ($5) x2\n*Bud light ($4) x2\n\nThey have happy hour daily 12pm - 1pm and 5pm - 7pm. I don't really know what specials fall under this, but maybe the $5 jameson shots are a part of it? Not sure how much the bud light was, but I know each round was $14, so I'm guessing the price listed above. We were here for about two hours, so we had two rounds.\n\nThe atmosphere after work is very lively. A lot of people talking and drinking. The vibe is divey as it's dark and kinda old inside. The bartender was nice and gave us our rounds when we ordered them. Not sure if they serve food here, but I saw people bringing in food from other places. Good that's an option in case you get hungry.\n\nConvenient if you want a few cheap drinks after work as the bus stop is right outside.", "author": "Elena N."}

Have no mistake, Sutter Station Tavern is a no-nonsense watering hole for those seeking a drink at almost all hours of the day. \n\nThe characters are colorful. The drinks are plenty (and reasonable). The service is affably gruff if you can imagine that. Perhaps therein lies the charm of Sutter Station. A dive bar in the middle of a quickly gentrifying city. Weekdays you have a post-work FiDi crowd and weekends they're fending crazies from stumbling in.

The bouncer was cool, in an island Samoan kind of way, and he told me kindly where to find the restroom key after I downed my whiskey shot  and dipped some of my beer.as I went to locate said key it wasn't in place and so I went back to ask if it's gone it means someone is in there. He said yes. So I went back and waited. Enjoying the great dive bar feel. Then a kid comes out of the bathroom. An employee. A bar back type with Latino/white dark haired accents, that must have graduated to tender at some point.  He had the keys so I kindly ask him for them and he kindly said yes then handed them to me before he actually thought and said \"whoa wait, are you a customer?\" To which I replied, \"yeah, do I need to buy a second drink from you to hit the head, or what\" and that's when the female bartender vouched for me and he lost his cool and told me off, saying not to give him attitude, to which I replied \"what?\". So I went to the bathroom. I came out put the keys back and went back to my chair where my beer and shot were and  he eventually came over and said \"I didn't mean to offend you but you just grabbed the keys out of my hand\" and I replied \"No, bullshit, I politely asked for them, and you handed them to me\" and he came unglued and flipped out and told me off how I was aggro and I said \"no dude. I'm cool... you, though, should go do more coke in the bathroom. It obviously calms you down\" then I finished my drink and left never to come back. Thanks young brunette half Latin or Italian looking kid. I appreciate it.

Where real people drink!\"\n\nThe counterpoint to this dilemma is practically Grecian in its irony. Sutter Station is like getting blasted with a flamethrower after complaining about the the cold. It's cash only, crowded, dingy, balmy, noisy, and charmless. There are real people sure, but they're mostly glued to the game, or wondering how the fuck you got in there.

It's also conveniently located right above the Montgomery BART station.   The flaws, however, are many.  \n\nFirst of all, the bathroom is a joke.  It's filthy, but that's not the problem. The problem is that you have to ask the bartender for a key every time you have to piss, and every time you ask, he'll act like you're becoming a burden.   It's almost like he don't like the clientele staying for more than one drink.  \n\nThe bartender I speak of is a clean-cut, dark haired guy in his 30s.  He's a real ass. I've been to the place twice, and within that limited time I've seen him refuse to serve an obvious tourist because the dude had an energy drink with him, and I've seen him scream at a young lady working with him for putting too much booze in a whiskey sour.  He'll also do his best to ignore you.  This guy doesn't want to be working at Sutter Station, and he doesn't want you drinking there.\n\nThe other serious problem with this place is that it doesn't keep a regular schedule.  Before my two visits here, I had, on numerous occasions, found the place closed.  They have 'hours' listed, but those mean nothing.  Even if you ignore my suggestion to avoid this spot, don't bother making it an actual planned destination.  Chances are you'll get there and it'll be closed.\n\nWish there were more affordable bars in the area, so this place would close, or, better yet, reopen with some new management.", "author": "Christopher F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-19", "description": "I'd like to begin this review by stating that I hate the Yelp App today. I just spent 20 mins writing a funny, entertaining review and just because I hit the wrong key on my cell phone, I lost the entire review. Remember to save and save often..\n\nAnyhow.. I recently began working near 4th and Market and decided I needed to explore the night life in the area after work. I get off work about an hour before my BF a couple nights a week and try to kill time by having a cocktail. My first night I chose Sutter Station, a relatively classy dive bar near Embarcadero Station where everyone, and I do mean EVERYONE, was drunk-n-diculous (drunk+rediculous). In fact I do believe the 3 people behind the bar were hands down the most intoxicated patrons in the establishment.\n\nI was VERY warmly greeted and flattered when I arrived. It didn't take but a minute to tell that the bartenders were clearly working the \"one drink for you, one drink for me\" style that night. (I am refraining from stating which night to protect the employment of these bartenders, because other than being smashed, they were super cool, friendly, and made amazingly delicious and unbelievably strong drinks). I ordered a kamikazi from the bartender who was actually working- apparently two of the people behind the bar weren't working. At least not at that time.  My drink was perfect and probably had nearly 3 shots of vodka in it. After two of them, even with my amazingly high tolerance I was feeling warm and fuzzy, had I had a third I no doubt would've been having as much trouble forming words as the bartenders!!\n\nSutter Station was surprisingly clean and the decor was such that the 9 to 5 suit and tie crowd would be just as comfortable spending happy hour unwinding from work to avoid the rush hour commute as would tourists, hipsters, or the kind of rough crowd that seems to migrate there on the late night. I recall being surprised at how nice, new, and clean everything looked. Granted it was a quiet night- there were only about a dozen patrons, but I kind of had the feeling it had been recently remoddled or given a face lift at least. I tried to ask the bartenders but the question was never answered- can't imagine why not lol ;-)\n\nOverall I had a lot of fun because of how intertaining the staff was. Don't get me wrong, drunk bartenders are not always a cool thing. It was ok that night because I was in a good mood, had plenty of time, was thrilled by the over pouring of liquor, and was alone so the \"show\" was welcome. Had it been a busy night, or I'd been with a group, it could of been disastorous. But it was fun that time.", "author": "Lisa H."}

I have a pretty standard bar order, vodka soda with soda on the side. (Gotta stay hydrated). Bartenders everywhere accommodate this request for \"soda on the side\" without charging me (really it's just like water, the amount of C02 used in a glass of soda probably costs the bar less than a cent). \n\nNow there are some places where you can expect to get charged for extra soda, like pricey hotel bars or nightclubs. But even in places without a soda gun, where they pour from bottles of club soda, I don't have to pay extra. \n\nThe other day, however, I placed my usual order and was charged an extra two bucks for soda. I know it's a minor issue, and this is a rant, but even dive bars should treat patrons  with respect. \n\nI asked the bartender if he just charged me for soda and he said, \"yes, it's extra. It's another drink.\" (seriously?) When I let him know that EVERY time I've been in there I haven't been charged, he looked at me oddly and said dismissively \"that's not the way we do things here.\" (He really seemed to have his finger on the Sutter Station pulse).\n \nInteresting and idiotic. Does he realize that I was going to give him the two bucks as a tip? And if he gave me the $2 back I'd actually tip him $3? Would he rather put $2 in the till for the bar owners rather than his own pocket? Piss off a regular customer? I just don't like to hang around in the presence of stupid bartenders, and it seems this place is rife with 'em. Pissing people off seems to be \"the way they do things\" at this place. \n\nThere are a lot of better options for a quick after work drink (a few on second street and one on first street between market and mission). I'm sure I'll be back as it's rarely as crowded as the other places (wonder why?) and all I want is a drink while I wait for my wife to get off work. I'll just make sure I don't sit down in front of that jerk from the other day. \n\nI honestly can't recommend this place as being a good bar. It's only marginally tolerable without the bad treatment.

I've seen how the dudes playing dice at 11pm on a Tuesday had the female owner's back when a cracked out homeless guy came in, threatening her.  That's community, one cheap, stiff drink at a time.\n\nI've seen fights break out here, and bad behavior, but for all of it, I've also seen a sort've overriding respectful tolerance.

Her name was Vicki, and my jaw dropped in amazement when we first met sight unseen at Sutter Street Station.  She was incredibly cute...and a sweetheart too! It was the one of the few times in life where I placed the coinage of effort-invested into the match.com slot machine and the reels didn't come up all lemons.  Two beers and a ten minute stretch of idle chat had things going in the right direction....Then out of nowhere come a passel of underwear-clad women that looked like the \"before\" pictures in a Jenny Craig weight loss ad.  I tried to tune it out....but the whole thing got sort of up-close-and-personal when an overly-buxom woman sporting an outfit that looked like something straight off the discount rack at Fredrick's of Hollywood came sauntering over to our table. She flashed her best come-hither grin asked if we wanted to buy raffle tickets for the outfit she was modeling.  Great environment for a first date, no?  I'm a fast drinker....and luckily Vicki was too.  Come the bottom of our glasses, we didn't stick around for another....\r\n\r\nSutter Street Station is the Financial District's last down-and-dirty after-work bar.  If you want to get grittier, you've gotta head South to SOMA or make tracks Westward to the Tenderloin.  In another part of town, Sutter Street Station might pass for a neighborhood bar....but as we all know, there's no neighborhood at Market & Sutter.  It's prime location less than 50 yards from Montgomery BART makes it convenient for commuters, and the fairly large seating capacity does a good job of handling rush-hour crowds.  The place gets hit with the downtown after-work crowd around 4:30pm on weekdays. The rush lasts till 7:00 or so, then starts dying out...quick.  A few hardcores hang out in the morning, there's a brief wave at lunch, then things quiet down till around 4 PM or so when the rush hour starts.  By 8:00PM, all the commuters have long since hopped on their mass-transit of choice, and anybody looking to party into the night doesn't stick around.  \r\n\r\nSutter Street Station has a good location.  That's about it.  Dingy, Dark interior.  Hit-and-usually-miss crowd.  Higher than average beer prices, and dead any time other than 4pm to 6pm.  It's dooable during the rush hour...but there's little reason to pop by during the weekend.  And if you're meeting a first date somewhere downtown after work, be warned....last I checked, the underwear shows are still a weekly thing....and age hasn't improved the women who partake in them.", "author": "Mike W."}

Walked in, dark, a bit gloomy, two guys seated at a table playing dominoes. We bellied up to the bar and asked if there was a place to get pizza nearby. The bartender gave us a menu and said she'd call their place if we wanted. We ordered two bloody marys and a Corona while we waited. \n\nAnd then something strange happened. The heavens opened up and angels sang to me. The jukebox called for me to play every hairband sing along song, followed by something by Travis Tritt, and wrapped up by definitely something by Chingy.

I want my cheap vodka soda, and I want some free pizza and lumpia.\n\nSure it's seedy. Yes it sometimes smells like pee. And ya, I am pretty sure that the guy who used the restroom before me was shooting up. I don't care. The drinks are strong, priced fine by me, and I love the staff. SS is a place where everyone has to come down a notch. Everyone has come down a notch.

The prices for drinks are reasonable and and they have some good beers on tap.

Plus the bars are a little more scarce in this particular block. We sat at some low tables with a booth, and watched the staff kick out a couple of underage girls. It's a bar that you can't decide what it's trying to be. When it's really hopping, I can't even tell you what the crowd is like.

The regulars during the day look like they have come straight out a Leaving Las Vegas scene. Construction workers on the lam, lawyers going through bitter divorces (from having had knocked up a young stripper somewhere, j/k), and stock/mortgage brokers not doing so well, all of whom are on a 4-5 hr lunch break? Then comes happy hour with the commuters and people finishing up their work days not wanting to run in to other coworkers or pay the inflated price of the other bars about. There are always seedy folk standing around the outskirts as it is right toward the end of Market near to the bus station. On the upside, the drinks are stiff. Drafts... common for the area as there really is no happy hour. Taking in to consideration that from a keg of beer at cost, the owner is paying 35- 40 cents tops per pint, charging $5 for a pint is funny. A staple bar for hardcore alcoholics with their designated stools and a staff that mostly only pays attention to their grumbling, stumbling down and out regulars.

But, in order for me to like a good dive bar I need to actually be served at a dive bar.  So, here's the story: I came in with some friends after work and walk up to the bar to order a drink where I was informed that I would not be served because I was already \"too drunk\".  This came as a surprise to me since, you know, I wasn't.  I had, at that point, only had 2 drinks over the previous 3 hours and was quite a ways away from being \"too drunk\".\n\nWhen pressed for an explanation, she said \"look at you, you're white as a sheet, too pale, I can't serve you.\" \n\nMy friend, who was with me, was served, and he had been drinking steadily for the previous 3 hours.  He is also Indian and decidedly not pale.\n\nI didn't know being pale was a sign of inebriation.  I'm sorry, I'm a programmer in San Francisco; I don't get a lot of sun.\n\nAnyway, I drank water.  At first they didn't want to serve me water, but since we had a party of 8 or so the bartender said I could stay.  The quality of the water was ok.  I'll give them that.  It was simultaneously cold and wet, which are two qualities I look for in water. \n\nIn short, I think the bartender was just crazy and/or a bit drunk herself. I didn't raise a fuss because fighting with a bartender is generally a waste of time and effort.  I will not, however, go back. \n\nUnless I want some water.", "author": "Chris V."}

Bad mistake.\nI was standing at the bar talking to my new friend about fighting for no particular reason (we have both trained in martial arts) and as if on queue a fight broke out behind us. Some drunk guy was acting a bit belligerent, so the bar owner came out to attempt to shut him up and get him to leave. A few minutes later he was attacked by no less than 6 guys who proceeded to beat the bloody hell out of him. I have never witnessed something like this in person and it was shocking to say the least. It almost turned into a full bar fight like you see in the movies. Two or three tables were overturned as the animals continued to beat the defensless guy to death. As if that wasn't enough, they then dragged the guy out of the bar by his hair. At that point he was motionless like a corpse as he probably was within an inch of his life. They kicked his head as they dragged him out. We didn't even want to know what they did to him when they got him outside. The cops and ambulance showed up shortly thereafter and we got the hell out of there. \nFolks, nobody should have to witness this kind of brutality anywhere. I'm not naive, but this was sickening to watch. What could have been so offensive to these shitbags that they needed to do that to another human being? \nSo it goes without saying that I hold the venue partly responsible for this, and hence my one star. I have been in this place on a number of other occasions and the one thing I noticed besides the awful smells was the clientele, or patrons. There are only two types that hang out there - the financial district crowd eager to get a taste of \"the other side\", and those that belong in such a hell hole because that's all they've ever known in their miserable existence; the kind that would beat a man like they did for being drunk and belligerent.

Someone had a pallet of pizzas delivered and we had some for free.  There was an ongoing raffle with sleazy prizes like lingerie, boxers, free drinks (FREE DRINKS PLEASE).  This was led by a lady with shiny booty shorts.  She had a costume change between each raffle and peddled various other wares.  I get free tickets, joyous day.  Didn't win, but enjoyed their Blue Moon x3.  Oh and step more than 2 feet away from the front wall if you're loitering outside on the phone or smoking... the birds are merciless with their poo-bombs.", "author": "Marjorie B."}

Two Stars for the fact that, for the first time since I've come to SF, I didn't have to pay for any of my drinks. Not that I expect men to buy me drinks and love paying for my own drinks, but when someone offers, I am not going to say no, dig?\n\nThe next two stars are for the fact that I met more interesting and friendly \"characters\" in 15 minutes in that place than my entire time in SF so far.  Cases in point: the wanna-be thugs with more fake bling than game who fell in love with me and a stripper selling raffle tickets (and God knows what else) who entertained my friend and I with her dating horror stories. And who \"gifted\" my friend and I with some lingerie that I so did not want but I'm sure will be a big hit with one of the nice working girls in front of Divas who are friendly to me and will be getting the teddy and thong set the next time one compliments me on my hair or outfits.  (Well, they are friendly to me except for that one time when I went for a classic rock and roll trashy look one night while strolling out to the Hemlock and realized from the nasty glares that I received from the \"gals\" that I should never wear a leopard fur jacket & heeled rocker boots--albeit with a Stooges tee and jeans--in my neighborhood again. Sorry gals, I was not on the make, I just wanted to work a female Keith Richards meets Kate Moss look that night.)  \n\nSutter Station is a weird downtrodden, random sort of place but it is a hell of a lot of fun. \n\nI think it is like Douglas Coupland wrote:  Only the disenfranchised and the freakishly beautiful can truly party with abandon.  Not that Sutter Station had any beauties that I saw, but it had a boatload of freaks and cheap booze and to me, that always means a fun night out.", "author": "MakeUp M."}

There arent actually any happy hour specials that i could find.... our drinks ended up ranging from $6-9, which doesnt seem happy hourish.  But, my amaretto sour was very good and strong, not too soury, very amarettoy.  A lot of places make that wrong.  This is a little dive bar, very small, and crowded.  We had to wait a tiny bit to get a table, but not too long.  At the back room, there is a pool table.  At first, the crowd was more people right out of work, but then it went over to the regulars.  Which happened maybe 630 or 615.  It's funny, that place is so cramped and then when you walk in you get ambushed for your id, while people are squeezing by with their drinks.  The best part about this bar tho is the lingere.  Ok, i cant spell, but i mean underwear.  I guess on tues and thurs they have a lingere show, but on the other days, they have a woman who walks around in her lingere, changing often, selling raffle tickets to guys, and giving a free one to every woman.  You can win a free drink, or lingere.  we didnt win.  the other girls were a bit offed by the presence of this woman but i thought it was great.  really quirky and just fun.  it seems like it's a great job too, cuz she'd get a lot of tips.  kudos to you lingere girl at sutter.  :)  i just wish theyd had the full show there when i was there.", "author": "Merredith L."}

There really aren't many dive bars left in this city after the dot com boom. They've all been discovered and ruined! But Sutter Station lives on as a funky, cool, sf dive bar. The inside is quite nice, actually. WIsh I had my camera to take a pic. It's all wood panneling inside and lit up with white xmas lights. It's super busy with after work folks mixing with all day drinkers. You know it's a dive bar when....(drum roll please)....each round you get of the same drink is totally different!! haha...seriously. I kept it simple with a rasberry stoli and soda, and asked for a splash of lime (ok, not super simple, but not hard either). First round I got a cranberry splash, and the soda was flat, second round I got a splash of lemon twist, third round I got a lime finally, but never any lime juice. So funny.
