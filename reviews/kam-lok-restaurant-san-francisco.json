The tables and chairs are the same ones from years ago. The waitresses seem overworked or at least always bustling about. This being Chinatown, don't expect 4 or 5 star service. Wave one down when you want attention.\n\nObviously Kam Lok focuses on the local Chinese population, and not the tourist crowd. To stay in business all these years Kam Lok must be doing something right.\n\nYes, it's all about the inexpensive but authentic Cantonese food. We watched people order beautiful streamed whole fish, stir fried Dungeness crab, and huge oysters in the shell...for lunch!\n\nEverything tasted pretty close to what we remembered from pre-Yelp years. We really came for the San Francisco specialty, Hung Tao Yee Fu Won Ton. It's deep fried won ton in a type of thickened egg drop soup.

If you want decent food in Chinatown, go to capital instead. The food here is not great, on top of that, the owner literally charges everyone different prices for the food. They charged me 8.70. As I went back to eat my lunch, my colleague told me that he was charged 8.30, and my other colleague that they knew was charged only 7.30... I understand that it's your business but at least be honest with everyone about pricing.

Everyone here was literally Chinese except for my boyfriend and me. We were walking around Chinatown taking in the sights and we had no idea where to go for dinner. We hear a lot of noise coming from downstairs and so we decided to check it out. First glance we saw that it was packed so to us that was a good sign. A grandmother was reading the newspaper at a table and one of the ladies scooted her out so we could sit...kind of awkward but I guess they wanted to make room for paying customers. \n\nSo here's the deal. You can't come to a place like this and expect superb service and five star dining. You have to take it for what it's worth and understand the culture. One of the waitresses luckily spoke well enough English so we were able to order from her. Some of the other ladies did not so we had to point and smile and nod but they were very accommodating and eventually brought us whatever we needed, like ice water instead of tea. They don't come by and ask you if you need anything. If you need something you wave someone down. They are super busy and won't bother you if you don't bother them. Unfortunately when they were clearing our dishes a little bit of sauce from the plate splattered on my boyfriend but hey, it's fine because you have to lower your expectations.\n\nFood: Menu is huge but there are a lot of repeat items. They have traditional dishes as well as some Americanized dishes all at a very low cost. Also, the portions are large. A soup cost around $6 and I figured it would just be a small bowl but it was a decent size bowl meant for sharing. Family style is very common in Asian cuisine. So we kind of went a little overboard since everything was so inexpensive and ordered enough food for a family of 5 for just my boyfriend and me. The spring rolls were good, nice and crispy. The pan fried dumplings were also good with a decent filling but they didn't come with any sauce. So they were a tad bland. I order a wonton soup with vegetables. The broth was clear, clean, and savory. Fresh vegetables and nice size wontons. I was impressed with the freshness of the vegetables and really enjoyed my soup. I also ordered Chinese broccoli with garlic sauce. Huge portion and perfectly blanched with a nice crunch (so not too soggy) and you could really taste the garlic which I love. My boyfriend took a dive and ordered something unusual. I think he was imagining something different. It was some type of meat and tofu in a clay dish. He said he really liked the sauce, it was a think gravy sauce which was different and maybe not his favorite consistency, almost gelatinous, but the taste he enjoyed. It was neat to try something maybe more traditional. \n\nOverall we were pleased with our experience and have stories to share about our time in Chinatown. If you want to get out of your comfort zone and dine with Chinese families, come to Kam Lok.", "author": "Debi N."}

The crab was a good size. It could have been wok fried a little better to bring out the flavor, but still a good dish. The adore chicken corn soup, so this was a good start to our meal. The mustard greens were a nice portion though a tad mushy. Still good garlic flavor. The clay pot was alright. Kind of small, but still more than enough to feed the 3 of us. I didn't try the spareribs as I don't like the sweet and sour sauce.\n\nMy mom saw another restaurant patron order chow mein. It looked like it was fried perfectly, so she decided to order the Beef chow fun with bean sprouts ($6). This was my favorite dish. The noodles had a nice chew. And it was dry fried perfectly.

Yes, the server sort of drops the plates in front of you and is less-than social. That being said, it's allllmoossttt a part of the experience! Look around the restaurant and notice that you're most likely the only tourist in there. You're surrounded by Chinatown locals grabbing a quick bite.

My mom, older sister and I were in ct just looking for a quick- cheap lunch and we saw this place. When we began walking down the stairs, I noticed the really dingy pink wall paint  and got a sketchy vibe. It was barely 1:00pm and it was packed inside so we just expected it to be a hole in the wall restaurant. (Like all those elite yelp reviewers call it) When we were seated, we were immediately given a menu (that's a good thing). But the staff were no where to be found. We waited for the staffs to come over but they kept walking around, talking to other customers. Finally, we waved one of them over and placed our order. We got a beef fried rice, some sort of lo mein that's usually expensive [I'm not sure the name] and a chicken crispy fried noodle. When a waitress in a blue hoodie came over to scoop our  soup into bowls, my mother said it was fine and we could scoop it our selves politely. The woman immediately dropped the ladle and walked away. No smile, no response, just dropped the ladle, turned around and left. Ok whatever we brushed that off- no biggie. The soup was alright. The first dsh that came was the lo mein. It was obviously made from one of those store bought fried lobster noodles that were reconstituted(I could've made it better at home). And they carelessly cooked the noodles so that it was still chewy. It's not supposed to be chewy. A few CANNED mushroom slices were thrown on top along with a few \u5440\u83dc. Nothing else. Just \u82bd\u83dcand canned mushrooms. Next up was the fried rice. How could you mess that up. It was good but my sisters complaint was that she got 2 LARGE crystals of msg in a bite. (I don't mind msg and expect it anyway so it's whatever). Next came the fried crispy noodles. Classic! But When they were carrying it down to our table, my sister and I made a face to each other about the sour smell coming towards us. We told our mom to take a bite first. She said it was kind of off. Then, I picked some off the plate. THE SAUCE WAS SPOILED. it had gone bad and was such a disappointment. OK well you're probably thinking this review isstupid and nit picky  now but no, there's more. We called over a woman in a red shirt and asked her was it supposed to be sour (spoiled) and she simply responded oh \"I don't know, I don't know this dish\" and walked away. Moving along, when we got our bill, we told another waitress our noodles were spoiled and it was sour tasting. She said \"it's probably the \u82bd\u83dc, it's definitely the \u82bd\u83dc. \" After that, she also just walked away, not taking the plate, offering a replacement, or apologising. Yes, I know I'm dining at a Chinese restaurant and they don't have perfect service but really, I expect better. I've eaten at plenty of Chinese restaurants but damn it was a really crap experience. \nYou usually get what you pay for and for me, I got less that what I paid. The prices really reflect what you get. It's cheap but you get super trash ingredients that are spoiled.

The restaurant next door to Kam Lok, Hunan House, was a friend's favorite but was cash only for the night so we had to go next door to this hole-in-the-wall, basement level family restaurant. It looked like one of those places that could either be your ticket to a night of vomiting or the best kept secret in Chinatown.\n\nWe ordered the A family style meal, Canton style (the B option is Peking), and it was all right. I'm not the biggest fan of traditional Chinese flavors to be honest, but my friends were all really pleased with our food. \n\nAlmost all that I ate was the dumpling soup, with pork dumplings that were kinda tasteless and mushy, shrimp that were okay but had a slight brightness so I ate a lot of them, bits of cha siu, and veggies.\n\nThere was a sweet and sour pork that everyone else enjoyed a lot. The one piece of pork I tried had a lot of connective tissue and more breading than meat. The broccoli beef looked good, and while the sauce was too strong and salty for me, the broccoli was cooked well, not overcooked at all. My friends really loved both the bbq pork fried rice and the chow mein type noodle dish with chicken. There was also an almond chicken dish - I liked the snap peas in that dish a lot. The chicken in all the dishes was just not a good texture to me, but maybe I'm just too picky.\n\nThis was definitely a locals kind of place - none of the wait staff was polite or even remotely interested in helping us.

Oh well.\n\nThe meal was cheap, $11.99 per person for the family style meal, and about a dollar more each for tax. \n\nThe main reason for two stars is on the way home, two of us started to feel pretty sick. I never, ever, EVER get sick at restaurants, no matter how much raw fish I eat or how hole-in-the-wall a taco shop is, but the rest of the night my stomach was making noises I have never heard it make and it was just not sitting well with me whatsoever.\n\nThe others said they were fine but I just can't believe how bad I still feel, 4 hours later, when all I ate was some soup, shrimp, and veggies I picked out of the broccoli beef and almond chicken dishes.

I did not see meat in my soup, just veggie, but I tasted a bit of meat and the broth was oily. I should have known better, but I'm not too picky in my attempt to pursue a vegetarian diet. Their eggplant is good though. I went around 1:45pm and they weren't too busy. They were attentive and nice. \n\nI went here for dinner once too. They have a vegetarian special. For about $11/person, you get a place of eggplant, plate of string beans, plate of fried rice, vegetarian soup, and eggrolls. It was a lot of food. It does not look all that fancy, but it was good. It was on the greasy side but the deliciousness made up for it. $24 for dinner with tax. Not bad for two people and a lot of food. \n\nWhat I like about this place is that they don't try too hard to impress their customers.

It has the potential to be 4 stars.\n\nMy friend (the one who liked Great Hunan) and I were on a quest for a set of Chinese Chess.  He's a big tall white guy who sits in Chinatown on his lunch break and watches old Chinese men play that game with fascination.  Today, he asked me where he could buy that game, so we wandered around, asked a few places, and finally found a set that was to his liking.  We got hungry, so I suggested a place that neither of us had tried before.  My rationale for doing that is to a) try new places, and b) not get blamed for a bad place.\n\nWe ended up at Kam Lok, and upon surveying the menu outside, we walked down the steps into the little basement (how do these places pass inspection for being handicap-accessible??).  We were seated right away, and the other people in the restaurant were mostly families, including one with two small children who seemed very interested in watching us eat.\n\nRelatively clean for being a Chinese basement place, and the prices are relatively good.  They have lunch specials that come with rice, and they range from about $5 to $7.  Braised tofu, sweet & sour pork, broccoli beef, etc.\n\nI decided on prawn won ton soup ($6), after being too overwhelmed with the other choices of won ton soup (chicken, wor won ton, beef, pork, supreme broth, what?).  It came with about 6 (that's it?!) won tons (pork and a bit of shrimp), and about 6 cooked shrimp.  The broth was hot, flavorful and slightly spicy, since I'd asked for it that way.  The soup also had bok choy.\n\nMy friend ordered the sweet & sour pork ($5.50) and it was a really big plate of white rice, with pork and bell peppers sauteed in sweet & sour sauce.  Good price for the portion, but since I'm not a fan of the sweet & sour, I didn't get to taste any.  He seemed to definitely like it though.\n\nBill came to $12.40 with tax.

Ordering hot and sour soup or mongolian beef at a restaurant like this is, well, what can I say?\n\nFor what it is, a local neighborhood restaurant in Chinatown, Kam Lok rates five stars for food.  For ambiance, this restaurant is a classic.  I ate here growing up as did my father. There is a reason why locals only eat here and it boils down to one thing: wok aroma (wok hei) or the flavor unique to Cantonese food produced by a well seasoned wok, a high-quality high-fire cooking oil, intense heat, and a skilled chef.\n\nNewer Hong Kong style restaurants often lack wok hei and wok hei is hard to produce in a home kitchen without a professional wok burner.  Furthermore as restaurants change hands and the older generation of wok chefs retire, fewer and fewer restaurants are able to produce food with the right flavor. These days, family-run restaurants with an experienced hand in the kitchen like Kam Lok are few and far between.\n\nOrder the Cantonese home-style classics:  mustard green soup, steamed whole fish, fresh garlic fried vegetables, dry fried rice noodles with beef, etc. and you are in for a treat.  When the last two dishes arrive, inhale before tucking in; that heavenly aroma is \"wok hei.\"", "author": "Craig Y."}

There is a sign outside pointing down to where the restaurant is, but its not too noticeable. \n\nWe went down the stairs into the place and were immediately seated by the waitress at a small table. There were not too many people there, but it seemed they are quite ready for larger crowds.\n\nThe menus were given to us and I have to say, I like the selection they have here. Normally when eating with the family we would order many dishes to share, but since this was just for the two of us, we decided on sweet and sour chicken and west lake beef soup. \n\nWhile waiting for our dishes, I looked around and noticed the decor. Not much to this place, mostly bare walls except for some advertisements on dishes, a large chinese character on the back wall, and a flat screen tv behind us showing a chinese tv station. The tables are fairly clean and simple, the chairs are a bit old, but as this is a cheaper budget restaurant, I can understand this.\n\nThe food came and we tried the soup. I am someone who LOVES good westlake beef soup, and this one was well pleasing. Prepared nicely, freat flavor, hint of sweetness, it was really good.\nThe sweet and sour was perfectly done, very tender chicken and the flavor was very nice. \n\nI have to say I really liked this place, the service was good, good food, and good price. Me and my fiance really enjoyed it and would return for sure.", "author": "Joshua Y."}

Everything was delicious, the portions were huge and very fresh. Yes, kids were running around and there are tanks holding catfish and other 'creatures' when you walk in. It is very minimally furnished/decorated. But the service was friendly enough and genuine.", "author": "Dana H."}

But if you want a quick bite like Rachel Ray's $40 a day, look no further. In fact, $38 bucks gets you 5 entrees 1) Live lobster 2)Braised Tofu 3)beef, egg drop soup 4)Mongolian beef 5)salt and pepper wings. All done just right. Yes, you read right, live lobster that's taken out of the tank there and then.\n\nThis is a Cantonese style place. As it is Cantonese, the \"wok hei\", or flavor-of-the-wok is the basic criteria for rating the food. This place has a lot of it. The food tastes Cantonese, light soup, stir fry with a lot of \"wok hei\" caramelization, and good ginger onion style seafood.\n\nThe $38 set meal is good for 4 people, or if you take it to go, it's good for two days! Take that Rachel Ray.", "author": "Vocal T."}

The service isn't that bad, considering the fact that the owners know us.  The soups are usually pretty good.  I love the ginger and scallion chicken.  If I am watching my mom's shop, I sometimes come here for lunch.  They have a special lunch deal which is porridge/congee and noodles for about 4 bucks.  Decor-wise, it's not the best, and I agree with some of the comments about the restrooms.  The way I see it, it's the same cleanliness as other chinese restaurants in chinatown.  No surprise for me there.", "author": "Philip L."}

I was walking to new king tin restaurant hoping for good food. But theres tihs woman who keeps yelling at the top of her lung GOOD FOOD GOOD DINNER. and it was really annoying and she kept dragging me into the restaurant. I ddecided to respect her decision since she was so into it and went in. At first i didnt even know there was a restaurnat there. It was all underground so i had to walk down the flight of stairs. I ordered a fried crab and a chow fan becuase they were on sale. My friends and i talked for like 15 mniutes before the rice came and after we got full then the crab came. I was really annoyed because it took so long. We ate the crab but the shell was really hard so we asked for a shell opener. But to my surprise, they didnt have any. I was so mad. We rapidly wrapped tihngs up . The check came out to be 67 bucks for nothing. I gave a 2 dollar tip and was out of there. Never going back to that place again.", "author": "Roger L."}

When you're swilly and mobbing through chinatown at 2:30 in morning, after a long night at the Li Po, nothing is better than a roast suckling pig rice plate, or a pile of crispy salt & pepper squid *drool*. Top all with chili sauce & enjoy! It may not be the greatest Chinese meal you'll ever have but the portions are sizeable & for $5 it's damn fresh, damn fast and they got brew too...Woo hoo! What more can you ask of a Chinese diner?   make sure they give you the white \"rice & noodle plate\" menu and not the green one unless you're trying to come out the pocket a la carte stylee.\n\nyou WILL be satisfied!", "author": "NaN K."}

My friend ordered the lamb rice plate, while I got the house special chow fun. The food was okay, but a little too greasy for my liking. It was kind of nice having the place underground, but it kind of felt too \"underground\" if you know what I mean. The decorations and service were effortless and quite ghetto. They were bitching the whole time I was there because some guy left without paying. All I can say is, this is not what I was expecting. (It smelled like a hospital in China.)", "author": "Alex Y."}

It has A LOT of items written in Chinese plastered all over the walls.  But some has pictures so you can tell what it is.  \n\nThey got excellent set dinner menus (NOT the BS stuff for tourists like egg rolls and sweet and sour pork!)  I mean they have set dinners like:  Ginger Lobster; Mongolian Beef; Stuffed Tofu; Mustard Greens; Minced Beef Soup...all for $28.\n\nThe food is good and I also checked the SF Sanitation score: 71.  Not bad for a basement joint.", "author": "Gary Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-06", "description": "This is a hole in the wall type of place, but the food is good and authentic,if you know how to order.  On weeknights, the place can be fairly packed with locals, which is a good sign.  You won't see lots of tourists here, and the ambiance is certainly not great.  The English menu is straightforward, but you get better dishes off the Chinese menu.  I'd rate it 4 stars for food, 3 stars for atmosphere; at times the owner's kids are running around like crazy; good for a laugh but could certainly annoy some who are not used to it.", "author": "Bentley L."}

We waited 30 friggin minutes to even get our first o five dishes (soup).  Soup is already premade, why did it take them so long to scope into two bowls and bring it out?  Being asian, the rice needs to come out FIRST or maybe even second after the soup, so we can eat it with the other entrees.  It came out LAST after asking them several times to bring it out.   The food wasn't even that good.  I'll never go back again.", "author": "LT B."}

My GF was finishing up a soccer game and the 1 line bus was stopped due to the biking people riding all over the city. We were starving and wanted to find the closest chinese restaurant. So we walked around and one of the ladies in there convinced us to go in because the prices seemed reasonable and fair and it seemed to be pretty crowded. When something is crowded you would think that a place is somewhat popular. With that said, we ordered a combo meal which seems pretty basic (Won Ton Soup, Pot Sticker, Monglian Beef, Chicken with Broccoli and Chicken Fried Rice for $10.99 each). We sat there waiting and waiting and it was literally 30 minutes and we still did not get any dishes. We were getting frustrated and we stood up and were about to leave until one of the workers said the food is coming. There food was not much better. Their Won Ton Soup was very plain and their pot stickers had no taste. Not only that, but when we got our beef and chicken dish it took them ages just to bring out the rice. What kinda chinese (even asian place) place serves their meat dishes before bringing rice out. Very unacceptable! I recommend never to come there ever!!", "author": "Nir B."}
