Parking is tough right outside, but try a block or two north and you should find some free two-hour parking. There are also two Muni lines that come here. \n\nIt's pretty hole-in-the-wall! Very simple and little to no decor, this simply delicious spot is a Marina staple. There is very little seating inside, three two-seaters and one table for four, so I would not come here to dine in with a group. It's definitely more of a to-go taqueria. \n\nAt first glance, the menu looks standard, and some might even a little boring. But this taqueria has been here since I was six years old (I'm 23 now) and the menu hasn't changed *one bit*. Menu items that stand the test of time in a neighborhood with a high turnover rate are never to be doubted. The chefs are the same boys that wrapped my burrito after soccer practice. They are very generous with their portions, and their ingredients are FRESH. I don't eat carnitas so I can't speak to that, but their chicken is JUICY and beef TENDER. This is my neighborhood burrito spot and I hope they never close.", "author": "Navila H."}

It had a good amount of chicken and guacamole. Two things I feel places will skimp on. What I didn't like about the nachos is the cheese sauce. It seemed like that really fake ballpark cheese.

It was not an auspicious start. There are no restrooms for the customers, so we had to walk over to the local library and use their facilities.\n\nIt is a rather small establishment. There is only one table which can seat a group of four, right in the front window. The rest of the tables can seat just two people, and there are not very many of them. Lots of people were ordering their food to go while we were eating.\n\nI would have seriously considered a tamale over a burrito if it were on the menu, but Los Hermanos does not serve tamales. So I ordered a chicken and rice burrito, with chips on the side.\n\nThe burrito was just okay. I think the salsa was just plopped on in a big blob. Some bites were spicy, while others were comparatively bland. The bigger problem was that the salsa seemed to be all heat and no flavor. The tortilla was rather soggy when I got to the bottom, they need to drain their ingredients (it was probably the black beans) more effectively.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was the chips. They were nice and thick, and we received an ample portion for our money. But that was not enough to offset the mediocre burrito.", "author": "The Bottomless Pi T."}

This is unfortunate because Los Hermanos is my favorite go-to quick lunch/dinner spot on a street that has many options.\n\nI always order a \"burrito bowl\".  It's somewhat custom.  I essentially ask for a tortilla-less super burrito (sour cream + guac) put into a to-go container.  I appreciate their flexibility in this regard.  \n\nI've tried different meats in my burrito bowl creation, and they're all good.  I like that there are two different chicken options:  grilled and in-sauce.  I tend to cycle through meats, selecting a different one each time I visit.  That said, if you were to plot my meat choices on the x-axis of a histogram, the results would show that grilled chicken would appear most frequently.  With such compelling empirical evidence, one can conclude that grilled chicken is my favorite burrito bowl meat.\n\nBeing a fan of spicy food, I ask for their pickled peppers/onions/carrots mixture, which I believe is called Escabeche (not 100% sure, however, as I just point to it and say \"Yes Please!\").  They also have a hot sauce that further enhances spiciness/flavor.\n\nThe staff is super friendly.  Two of them have an uncanny resemblance to one another.

Yuppies and 20 somethings were frolicking around, and the street was busy and deep in college football mode. Tacolicious was super busy and my friend and I were starving.  We love great food but at the same time we can compromise our standards from time to time, and we did just that- sacrificing quality for instant gratification at Los Hermanos.  In my 37 years of life, I had never made it to Los Hermanos, and I've eaten plenty of sketchy things before, so we took the plunge. Well, after today's meal, I am confident that I wont make it back barring nuclear fall-out.\n\nI'm confident that this is the best burrito spot on the commercial strip of Chestnut Street, but this is also the only one to my knowledge.  My carnitas burrito was whipped up in seconds, but completely and unacceptably cold on the interior (I ate it in the restaurant just 2 minutes later) and the ingredients simply tasted like they were sitting around.  This may be good had I stumbled out of a bar drunk in the middle of the night, but really it sucked completely sober at 1pm.

This was so below average. I had a carnitas super burrito -- the meat was weirdly dry and the whole thing was super salty. My brother had carne asada quesadillas....and the 'carne asada' was more like ground beef. Without Mexican seasoning!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-19", "description": "The four stars are solely because this place is right by where I work and it's basically the best cheap meal I've found in the vicinity. Los Hermanos seems to be catered a bit more towards blander tastes than the average SF taqueria, probably due to the Marina location. However, you can make a pretty good burrito with a few tweaks.\n\nFirst of all, the default cheese used is some sort of orange-y cheddar (?) so you have to ask for the white cheese. This will make a big difference. Secondly, the super burrito doesn't include cilantro, so be sure to ask for it. Thirdly, since their hot sauce isn't too spicy, if you want heat be sure to ask for jalape\u00f1os (which are mixed with onions and carrots). You can also get more hot sauce on the side.\n\nI'm never disappointed by the burritos I get at Los Hermanos (usually veggie or shrimp), but overall I probably wouldn't come here it wasn't so convenient. I've also tried some carne asada tacos, which were not good. The meat was really finely chopped and wasn't juicy at all; it was almost like a ground beef taco. They were wayyyy too dry. Los Hermanos lacks a salsa bar, or any salsa besides pico de gallo, which can be worked around for a burrito but not so much a taco. They also only have green onions, which I find odd. \n\nLastly, the service at Los Hermanos is great. The same two guys are always working (I'm assuming these are los hermanos) and they're consistently friendly and patient/accommodating with your requests while they're making your burrito.", "author": "Lily C."}

The guacamole is just fine, but it doesn't hold a candle to the freshly prepped alternative at Tacolicious, and the rest of their menu options follows a similar suit as well.

The Super \"Silver-Bullet\", which cost $6.50 was decent and acceptable.

Definitely not worth the price I paid.\nWhen I buy a beef burrito with beans, rice, and guacamole, I expect it to be warm and flavorful, but that is not what you will receive at Los Hermanos. They will instead give you a burrito that is just a little warmer than the guacamole they slapped on top. The rice will be mild and to some, maybe even flavorless, and you can bet that the beans are probably the reheated leftovers of yesterday. \nAt best, it was alright, just because I was hungry.", "author": "Anthony M."}

For around $10 you can get a large-portioned burrito and drink and if you choose a side of tortilla chips. (although I wouldn't recommend the tortilla chips because they were pretty bland when I got them). The burrito itself should be more than enough to fill you up -- and if it isn't, please check the scale.\n\nI would recommend Los Hermanos to anyone in the area who is looking for good Mexican food. There are only a few places on Chestnut that offer Mexican food, but I think Los Hermanos is the best bang-for-your-buck place in the area. The guys behind the counter are also really friendly and hard-working and get your order out super fast.

But they actually make it in front of you and they ask you what beans you want, if you want salsa & hot sauce... I haven't eaten enough Mexican food to tell if it is really good or not, but judging from my tastes, the first couple of bites were pretty good. then the onion taste gets too overpowering and I kept having this sour taste in my mouth =/ The beef was a little too chewy, and i wish they put more salsa in it because it got a little dry. The second time i went, i ordered the super mini nachos because i heard it was pretty good. Now, there's super mini nachos and super mini nachos with meat. I ordered it without meat, but he still asked me what meat i wanted... and i had to pay the extra, i don't know, dollar or two... They put a layer of beans on the bottom then chips, cheese, salsa, guac, & sour cream. By the time i got home 20 minutes later, the chips weren't crunchy. It would've tasted so much better if i ate it after i got it.

So we walked over from our hotel and ordered some simple and satisfying fare. The taco was very close to what I was taught to make; I don't know what your definition of \"authentic\" is, but chances are my my Mexican-American Mom and Nana don't care. Authentic when speaking in terms of Mexican food can mean a great many things, and chances are if you grew up with a relative from Sonora, you're going to have had a very different experience than if you grew up with a relative of Jalisco, Oaxaca or Boyle Heights. My point is, Cal-Mexican is just as \"authentic\" as the street tacos non-Latinos have now been taught to label as the only \"real\" Mexican food. Okay, rant over, but please Yelpers, curb the use of that irritating term \"authentic\". Other than the taco, the enchilada was really no more than a rolled quesadilla with enchilada sauce--they didn't really fry the tortilla like I would hope they would (and forget about baking it like my Nana taught me to do as canon)...but as I've said for other reviews, no one does enchiladas like they're supposed to. The rice was bland and the beans were all right; horchata was yummy. Servers were friendly and they take credit! If you're having a hankering like I was for some Mexican comfort food away from the comfort of home, take a shot with Los Hermanos. Not the best, not even close to a favorite, but it'll meet the need.", "author": "Brittany B."}

For a second I thought I was back in East LA! Well, not really, but the tastes and flavors were pretty good.  I saw that they used cheddar or some sort of yellow cheese instead of monterey cheese you'd typically see. Also, the rice and meat were seasoned, perhaps a bit more would be perfect. I  saw that the tortilla was kept in a semi-warm space instead of being flash-steamed like other places do which leave the tortilla sticky and gooey when you eat it.\n\nI'm still baffled why they offer to put lettuce in your burrito.

The service is uber-friendly and it's a nice, homey spot amidst the trendy Chesnut street eateries/bars.  The other Mexican places in the area are over-priced and just don't cut it for me.  \n\nI like the super chicken burrito, it's consistently good and I always have a third leftover for the next day's lunch.   An order of guacamole & chips are good to share with someone else.  Make sure to ask for a couple of healthy squirts of spicy sauce to make your meal more flavorful.  \n\nIf you want more authenic Mexican food, head over to the Mission area for your burrito fix.", "author": "T M."}

Not only is Los Hermanos authentic, delicious, unhealthy and wonderful, but it is has managed to get even the most health-conscience people in the Marina lining up outside. You can tell they never expected to be so popular, so the place is REALLY small. We've eaten in the dining room once but the traffic in and out of the place was slightly annoying. It's much better as a takeout spot. \n\nWhat i recommend: the super tacos are pretty good, except the sour cream and guacamole are a little watery, making the taco difficult to eat. Also, if you ge tthe super chicken or beef (chicken or beef with sauce) the taco is nearly impossible to keep in form. \n\nThe \"mini super nachos with meat\" are tasty too. They put a layer of beans, then chips, nacho cheese, meat, salsa, sour cream and guac. It's perhaps the best thing there. \n\nMy bf gets the breakfast burrito with carnitas and swears by it! One thing I would stear clear of is the quesadillas. While they are delicious, they have WAY to much cheese on them.", "author": "Sarah I."}

I love a good hole in the place because I have found they usually have the best, most authentic food. I was sorely disappointed when I had lunch here. My fianc\u00e9e had an enchilada which was warmed up in a microwave with sauce and cheese thrown on top. The texture of the cheese and tortilla combo was awful! I had a veggie tostada which consisted of a thin tostada covered in a mound of lettuce, cheese and tomatoes.... I would have been fine with chips and salsa just so i could eat something but they didn't even have any salsa! they had hot sauce on the table...I was shocked when we paid our bill for the \"food\" that we ordered and saw the price.

I must say though, it's almost comical how I can go in and give a complete, coherent order (super chicken burrito, refried beans, no guac) - and by the time they have warmed up the burrito wrapper and are starting to make the burrito, they have forgotten EVERYTHING I said.  First question I get is \"what kind of beans?\"  \"Um, the kind I told you I wanted - 30 seconds ago?\"  But, I just go with the flow and repeat myself. No biggie.", "author": "Alexandra D."}

NOW WHY WOULD THAT BE??  \nThe burritos are great, and you can tell them what you want more of\nor less of - if you want it hot, they will add more hot sauce! The\nburritos are huge and more than filling. The place is clean and\nthe food is always kept warm at the right temperature, so there\nis no need to worry about bacteria. They are always makinf new\nbatches of food - I have been coming to this restaurant since opened,\nand have never become sick. I really don't know where any of the\nreviewers are coming from.  The rest of the food is good too, not\njust the burritos, It is basically a take-out place, so don't expect a\nfancy place. The help is very friendly and cooperative and the service\nis very fast. The place seems to be pretty clean,", "author": "Girly Foodie F."}

My boyfriend ordered and paid for a Coke. He doesn't like ice in his Coke, but apparently told them a second too late to hold the ice. The owner had already started pouring the fountain drink and refused to dump out the ice and give him an ice-free beverage. Nor would he refund the $1.50 for the Coke. I understand if he had opened a can of soda this would be different, but fountain drinks are so cheap and there is no excuse to lose potential customers over the measly few cents it would've cost him to repour the drink. Pathetic.", "author": "Cher E."}

The burritos are great there....nothing compared to something you could find in the Mission, but probably some of the best in the Marina.  Los Hermanos is more of a whole in the wall mexican place then a \"whitenized\" version like Rubios is (if you could call that mexican food), which is another reason I like it so much....they haven't conformed to the normal Marina restaurant ways.", "author": "Isaac W."}

That said, bravo, loved the food.  Had a super chicken burrito and mom had the taco / enchilada plate.  Large portions, had left-overs for lunch the next day.  I'd definitely go back.", "author": "Cheryl D."}
