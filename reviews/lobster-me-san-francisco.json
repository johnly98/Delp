I'm glad we still went. It's located in a mall food court (but an relatively luxurious one at that) so ordering is the typical wait in line, get a buzzer then come back when your buzzer starts blinking. \n\nI ordered a half-size of the lobster roll that had half lobster and half crab meat. Wow. Every bite was delicious and left me wanting more. The waffle fries on the side were delicious!! Everything was so good that I even tried the cole slaw that it came with. And I don't even like cole slaw but it was the best cole slaw I've ever had and might actually order again. My table also ordered some lobster mac and cheese and, though a little pricey, it was perfectly rich and creamy.\n\nIf you're looking for a quick mall stop, this is it!!

I ordered the full lobster roll undressed- only with melted butter and chives. It came with criss cut fries and coleslaw. The lobster was chewy, dry, and not fresh! I literally had to drench it with butter to make it somewhat edible. The coleslaw was all withered and tasted old. The fries were barely served warm and made your mouth dry.

Going off how delicious her version tasted, I was really curious how Lobster Me would measure up. After viewing the menu and even scanning other peoples plates, the food looked very appetizing.  Similar to what my mother makes, I ordered the 50/50 California style which has half crab and lobster with sliced avocado and tomato. \n\nI got the full roll which was about $17. When I got the roll, it was smaller than I thought a full size would be. The taste was okay. I felt how they chose to prepare the mixture lacked in flavor. I wanted to give them my mother's number and say, \"please call her, please\". LOL!! |\nMy mother was an assistant chief at a university of high prestige. There were no mistakes in their methods of cooking and serving. What Lobster Me served would have not made it pass the bowl in which they made the mixture in. Sorry, but true.  \n\nSo I gave them 2 1/2 stars for presentation, good amount of meat on the roll, effort, and the fact that their fries were really good.", "author": "Shelly W."}

My bf wanted to order the lobster mac and cheese but they ran out. Weird.. how hard can it be to whip up some more mac and cheese, especially when we came in the middle of the day around 1 PM. \n\nAnyway, I ordered the Connecticut roll, which came with chips and coleslaw. Everything was subpar. The lobster roll was small and even though it was supposed to be flavored with butter and chives, it really lacked any taste. The chips were whatever, hardly ate any. The coleslaw was not even worth eating. No wonder why this joint has such terrible reviews.

Nothing really compares to the original, but Lobster ME is doing a decent job underneath the massive San Francisco Shopping Centre in their gourmet food court. Their freestanding booth is in the middle of the food court near Bristol Farms.\n\nThe menu is basic - lobster, chowder, and sides. I opted for the Connecticut which is similar to the hot buttered rolls found throughout New England. I preferred this option over the traditional mayo-based lobster salad, but the Lobster ME version was cold with little butter flavor. This may be a better place for the salad style roll.\n\nI had the extra lobster option which provided a similar amount found in New England rolls. The meat was good with a nice flavor and texture. The bread was on point, and opting for the seasoned French fries was a good choice.\n\nYou will spend a lot of money here. Lobster is expensive, especially the shelled variety. With so much good crab around, it is hard to justify lobster. This place is probably for the tourists instead. However, Lobster ME does meet a good quick-service basic lobster roll experience similar to New England McDonalds - not an insult - in the heart of San Francisco.", "author": "Kristian D."}

It is overpriced for the portions that they give you. I understand that this is San Francisco and you a San Francisco markup, along with the markup of being located in a popular mall, but come on, the markup is ridiculous. \n\nLe bf is a huge fan of lobster and lobster rolls. I, on the other hand, not a huge fan. Although I lived in Boston for 4 years, I didn't have a single lobster roll, or even lobster, until the bf came to visit and forced me to take a bite of his lobster roll. When we were made aware of this location, I dragged the bf here, knowing that the quality of food probably wouldn't come close to the quality found in Boston. \n\nHe ordered the lobster combo with lemonade and fries. I opted for Panda Express that day. After waiting 15 minutes, his order was ready. As he headed towards our table, I saw how small his roll was, and couldn't stop laughing. He gave me one of those please-be-quiet glares. \n\nUpon closer inspection, there were maybe 4 small chunks of lobster (I think I'm being generous) and the roll was the size of those made for the small hotdogs you used to get as kids at a BBQ. His roll was gone in about 4 bites and he was very unhappy panda. I felt sorry for the guy, so when he eyed my Beijing Beef, I sacrificed a few pieces to see a smile on his face. He definitely contemplated getting food from another vendor because he will still hungry. \n\nIf you are only wanting a snack, crave lobster, prepared to spend a lot of money on subpar food, and are nearby, I guess you could come here. Otherwise, go eat somewhere else. There are so many great food court options at Westfield.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

Their Lobster ME sign is so eye catching that it drew us to this place. Who doesn't love carbs and lobster? We decided to split a lobster roll as a pre-snack before dinner (don't judge!) The concept is order at the counter where you choose your \"fresh catch\" and then you choose what \"style\" you want it. We decided to choose the \"lobster\" which is served warm and the \"New England style\" which is the original. \n\nThere's a few bar stools to the left of the counter that you can sit if you want to feel apart of the restaurant. But if not, there are plenty of food court seating as well. We decided to sit at their counter and waited for our food. Our roll came out, and as expected, it was small. The lobster roll was served with waffle fries and coleslaw. The fries were VERY salty, the coleslaw wasn't anything special (I don't hate it), and the lobster roll was bland.

I'd leave a low rating too if I paid $18 for a sandwich smaller than my hand. Luckily, we were more interested in the lobster poutine, which was cheaper than the sandwich.\n\nFries were made to order, so it took 5 minutes or so to come out. We weren't blown away by amazing flavor, but it was definitely adequate and had enough lobster to satisfy us. Lobster was average quality. If I was eating this by myself, I doubt I could finish it - we couldn't finish it with two people.

I'm seriously not sure what happened here, but if you're looking for an Old Cape Cod-type of experience with the spray of the salty sea on your face and a sea captain telling you how the big lobster got away, this wouldn't be it. This is Westfield after all, the home of anything overpriced in San Francisco. The sad irony is that this is part of a chain that originates in Portland, ME, so you would think there would be some sense of that part of the country in the product. Nope, I've had lobster rolls in New England, and this didn't evoke any good memories of those lovely morsels.\n\nFirst, the service was interminably slow when I tried this spot recently. There was a dinner hour line that just wasn't moving with any sense of purpose. Once I got within view of the overhead menu, I decided to try their $18 Original Maine Style Lobster Roll. No, that wasn't a typo...yes, it's $18, which wouldn't normally raise my ire except this is a fast-food operation and I felt like some glass ceiling was breaking with that exorbitant price. When I got it, it was disappointingly small and probably amounted to $1.50 per bite. Although the buttered split-top roll felt authentic, the lobster just didn't taste that fresh.\n\nAdding insult to injury, they decided to add chunks of celery, chives and a heavy mayo as filler, so it appeared like you got more lobster meat. I decided to go for a combo deal that added a poutine-like concoction called Chowder Fries for an additional $6. Instead of brown gravy, they poured clam chowder on fries and added cheese sauce, chopped tomato and bacon bits as well. It was marginally better than the lobster roll, but I was already letting out a big meh by the time I ate it. There was a tiny bit of cole slaw which was hardly worth the effort of serving. With my small Diet Coke, I felt like $24 was quite steep for my downeaster downer of a meal (photo: http://bit.ly/1S408Kn).\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...absurdly high price for a paltry roll of marginal quality\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...it's the mall, remember?\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...still getting their sea legs, I presume\nTOTAL - 2 stars...maybe the Gorton's fisherman is available for house calls", "author": "Ed U."}

Everything is just so average, usually too oily, and blandly flavored. \n\nI ordered the \"Lobsticle\" with a side of fried clam chowder. The Lobsticle was actually pretty good. The lobster tasted decently fresh and was juicy. There was no flavoring, but they did give me a side of melted butter and lemon, which was an okay kick to the lobster. I would have preferred a more flavorful attempt, for example at least pepper or old bay to start it off and some garnishes. But again, it is food court food. The Lobsticle is pretty expensive, and when you get it, the tiny portion will tell you it's even more expensive. As for the clam chowder, it was pretty disappointing. I thought I would still get a chowder, except with fried clams. Instead, I got a huge fried clump that was filled with chowder. First off, the fried clam chowder was super inconvenient to eat, because if you took a bite, the chowder would instantly start pouring out of the shell. Then, were was all the clam? I maybe got 3 pieces in one of the clam chowder pieces, which was super disappointing. The clam was also really hard, which indicates that it wasn't fresh (probably frozen).", "author": "Michael Y."}

Check in with Yelp here and you can get a free cup of Lobster Bisque too, but don't expect any actual pieces of Lobster in it. It just sort of tastes like it and comes with the worst oyster cookies ever.\n\nIt's in what I believe is a cursed location off the escalator leading to the food plaza. Everybody will walk by it and check it out, but walk past it to check other places and then probably not come back to it. I've been here enough to finally give it a shot, the lobster smell got to me. \n\nI asked the cashier what she liked the best and recommended \"the Frenchy\" lobster melt. I unfortunately just didn't want to spend more than $12 at a shopping mall food court, so the Frenchy melt with chips was it. It is described as made with butter poached lobster, thick white bread grilled on a panini press with brie and shallot cream cheese. \n\nWell let's say it was more like an over buttered Wonder bread cheese melt with too much cheese and grease. The lobster pieces were sparing, but even with more I'm not sure I could have tasted it over the butter and cheese. Plus, it came with some absurdly soggy chips that were honestly soggy and worse than any Lays I've ever had. Just dump some fresh Lays in there and it might be better off.\n\nI'm glad that there's an option for lobster close by and not at a $$$$ premium, but considering it is a food court and downtown with subpar quality I really don't think this is the right spot or price point for the experience.

I was still hungry afterwards, so I decided to drop by Lobster Me for something to satisfy my hunger. I didn't know what I wanted before I got in line, but I knew I didn't want any bread. Decided on the soup and lobster tail. Upon getting the tail on a stick, it looks incredibly small. About the size of a giant prawn. I thought to myself, I wasted $12 on this?! But after picking it up and taking a few bites, it is larger than it seems. But it's still a super small lobster tail. I probably ate it in about 5-6 small bites. The soup was just plain bad. Super thick and goopy. Not a smooth creamy bisque like I wanted. The up side is there were pieces of lobster in the soup and it was a good dipping sauce for the lobsicle.\n\nLobster Me needs a little time to work out their service kinks as the line moved really slowly. The girl taking my order seemed to have issues with the POS system while taking my order, only to realize she was logged out of the system? Even the wait for the food took a while. And I noticed about 3-4 people who were behind me in line getting their food before I did. Maybe my tail takes longer? All the employees were really apologetic and very sweet which I appreciated.\n\nI'd say Lobster Me is like a fast food lobster stand.

I got the Golden Gate combo- the lobster has sesame miso sauce and shredded nori on top, coleslaw and chips. The coleslaw was bland but the chips were good. The consistency of the clam chowder wasnt super thick but wasnt super thin either, it was just right. Plus, there was a generous amount of filling inside and wasnt just the soup. The blueberry lemonade was good because it wasnt too sweet. The lemonade comes in a plastic pint size glass btw so its much more than New England Lobster gives.

To top it off, Lobster ME is also known for their lemonade; you'll want to order a second Blueberry Lemonade. And if you're a vegetarian- do not fear!

Lobster Me is fortunate to have employees like the ones that I saw when I went on a busy Saturday.\n\nI had the Bay Roll. The roll is more like a  toasted and folded piece of bread. I actually liked it more than a breadier roll. There wasn't a lot of lobster in the roll, what was there was okay, it was fresh and did not have a strong lobster taste. It was improved when I added lemon from the skimpy slice that was on the plate. I had the combo that included a soda and lobster bisque.The chowder was bland, salt or some other seasoning might have made it more interesting.\n\nNow, I do have a complaint. I did not notice that the meal included house-made potato chips that the online menu says is included, I did not get any and either did N. we were both unhappy they were left off the combo plate. I thought about going back to ask for them, but decided against that idea. Maybe the combo orders miss out on chips.\n\nI realize they just opened and there might be a few kinks to work out.

I ordered the Maine but after waiting for my order and because I had friends waiting for me, I thought I would try the CT roll which I was accidentally served. The lobster meat was \"ok\" and seemed to have more filler than you would get in Maine or NYC (where, at that price, there would normally be no filler).  Also, the bun was awful - dry on the inside despite being soaked in butter.  I scraped the few bits of lobster meat, which set me back $16, onto the plate and used garlic bread from my friend's meal from another food court joint to create my own roll.  Very disappointing.  \n\nTo make it worse, added on a small fountain soda and a tiny chowder for $6 more.   $22.75 for a lousy lunch - well - the chowder and soda were good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-29", "description": "What I ordered was very tasty, so that's what I'm basing my 4-star rating on.  I acknowledge that the portions were a bit small, especially for a mall food court, so if you're starving then you should probably get a 3-item combo from Panda Express.  I feel the big disconnect for most people is that the price/quality/portion is more like what could be found at a gentrified gastropub that serves $15 artisanal cocktails.  This place is best for a light lunch or a savory snack before/after a movie, if you don't mind dropping over $20 for a little indulgence.\n\nConnecticut Roll: Having grown up in Connecticut, I am quite particular about my lobster rolls.  Cold with mayonnaise (and other mix-ins) is for canned tuna fish, not for the glorious lobster!  We just call them Lobster Rolls back home, but I was pleased to see a Connecticut Lobster Roll explicitly called out on their menu.  The split top frankfurter bun with buttered and toasted sides was on point.  The lobster meat was warm and tasty; not rubbery at all.  They were a bit skimpy with the drawn butter mixed in with the lobster meat though.  Still, better than many alternatives I've found in SF.\n \nChowder Fries: Surprisingly delicious.  Thick-ish fries covered in a creamy (almost cheesy) sauce, bacon and tomatoes.  I was worried that the tomatoes would taste too raw compared to everything else, but it actually helped offset the richness.\n\nLobster Mac & Cheese: A creamy, gooey, rich cheese sauce over a bunch of al dente shells.  Happens to be topped modestly with lobster bits.  My preferred lobster mac & cheese makeup is with a gratin\u00e9ed cheese and bread crumb top and lobster bits mixed into the gooey cheesy pasta below.  So this one felt a bit deconstructed and haphazard.  Still was enjoyable since the cheese sauce was so tasty.  A little skimpy on the lobster (compared to the lobster roll),  but the lobster did help bring the pasta to the next level.  Probably the closest item to a \"normal\" filling lunch meal, because carbs and cheese.\n\nLobsicle (naked): A whole lobster tail on a stick that is grilled fresh to order and served alongside drawn butter for dipping.  About the size of a Safeway lobster tail at twice the price as doing it yourself in the broiler at home, but hey that's restaurant markup.  A little boring compared to the other ways lobster is presented here, but a good technique to just add more lobster if the other items don't satisfy your fix.\n\nOriginal Lobster Melt: I have mixed feelings about this.  At $10, it's similarly priced to the other bougie grilled cheese sandwiches found at specialty restaurants and food trucks in San Francisco.  It's relatively a lot cheaper than the $18 Lobster Rolls, which themselves are a bit light on lobster.  So it's really not that big of a surprise that the melt is heavy on the cheese with not much lobster meat.  And it's really cheesy at that!  In addition to a slice of gruy\u00e8re on each end, the lobster seems to be mixed in some sort of cheesy blend.  At first I thought it was mayo, like lobster salad, and thankfully I was wrong since I really dislike that style (see my Connecticut Roll praise).  Not sure what cheeses are in the mix, but I tasted a strong brie.  Anyway, all that cheese kind of overpowers the more subtle lobster taste.  So get this is you really like cheese and want a little extra lobster added in.  Don't get this if you want to get your lobster on.\n\nLobster Poutine: Wasn't a huge fan, the chowder fries were actually better.  The lobster bisque got absorbed into the fries very quickly making them quite soggy, whereas the brown gravy in traditional poutine is more viscous and has more time until sogginess.  Also, kinda light on the cheese curds.  The lobster was decent, like the same amount on top of the mac and cheese.\n\nLobster Bisque: Pretty standard.  I'm glad there were some bits of lobster floating around, since I hate when a lobster bisque has no actual lobster.  The main soup part was nice and creamy.  I didn't care much for the crackers; they were oyster cracker shaped but tasted closer to a Ritz than a Saltine, which really overpowered the soup.  I wouldn't go out of my way for the bisque, but it is a nice accompaniment to a sandwich.\n\nPotato Chips: Thicker than what you get from a bag in the supermarket, but that's usually how fresh chips work.  Nice and crunchy all around with a tiny bit of soft potato-ness in the center.  A bit too salty for my tastes though.\n\nColeslaw: Forgettable.  Tasted like a bunch of raw cabbage shreds in a container.  I'm not a fan of drenched/soggy coleslaw, but I'm also not a fan of coleslaw without much flavor.", "author": "Adam B."}

I then ordered the Signature Roll, which was to be warm lobster meat and chips. There was no Conneticut roll, but surely they wouldn't just serve dry lobster?  The chips were good.  The lobster meat was warm, but lacked the sweetness and crisp bite that I enjoyed on my previous visit.  It was flavorless and a bit chalky - in other words it did not seem fresh at all.  They offered ranch and some other sauce - maybe cocktail sauce?  Anyway there wasn't clarified butter at a lobster place.  \n\nI won't be back.

I was so hyped when they said that they were going to open in SF! I was so impressed with the lobster roll since I go to the new England area quite frequently and my experience with Vegas Lobster Me was quite comparable.  I love me some lobster rolls. I had told some folks to check out Lobster ME SF initially thinking the food would be prepared consistent across the board because my experience with Vegas location Lobster ME was so amazing! I was counting down till the opener in SF so as soon as I heard they were opening I was rushing to get over to Westfield. \n\nUnfortunately the opening of the SF Location was a different story. News of this location was spreading quickly and so the anticipation was thick. I believe it was supposed to open in July 2015 but that did not happen. I kept checking to see if they were open, but it took some time which is understandable. \n\nWAIT TIME & FOOD QUALITY: \n1.) We were able to pay for our food along with a crowd of other people waiting for their order. We got our food 28minutes later after we paid for it. (I checked my receipt) not good because seafood shouldn't be sitting for too long. \n2.) The bf ordered Lobster Mac & Cheese and it was like stale by the time he received it \n3.) I got a Lobster Melt which tasted like a block of Kraft singles smashed on bread. I opened it up and I was looking for the lobster which wasn't really there. The sandwich was like an imitation cheese block. \n4.) fries ehh they were cold by the time we got them and were tasteless \n5.) seems like they did not anticipate the demand and the quality of food is suffering.", "author": "Marie P."}

Like typical mall culture, one of us saved our seats while the other got food.  I was literally in line to pay for other food when the device buzzed, so I rushed over to pick up her food.  The shift lead or manager (and I'm guessing he's one or the other cause he's the only one not dressed in uniform) took my device, didn't have my food ready, asked me what I ordered, and actually had the nerve to blame me for taking too long!! Needless to say he was extremely rude the entire time...  Since I wasn't the one who actually ordered, I was bewildered (as any other restaurant knows your order automatically when you turn in the device) and said something like \"Why are you asking me? Shouldn't your system tell you?\"  It was a serious question since I just handed the device over, but his munchkin minion cashier turned around and tried to mutter something to me, as if I was the rude one.  \n\nAnyways... I finally got the food and it was not good at all.  It was super bland, and I stopped eating after 1-2 bites. Serious waste of $20.  \n\nTo The Owner: You should consider overhauling your rude staff.

One of the things I look forward to on my yearly LV getaways is parking on the 3rd floor of Planet Hollywood's parking lot, then entering the Miracle Mile shops, then making a quick right (or is it left?) to find Lobster ME - big, meaty lobster sandos - plain, with mayo, or maybe with some cajun seasongs...creamy, hearty chowders with nice, buttery chunks of lobster...they even have freakin lobster mac and cheese! and of course my fave, the Lobsicle - a whole maine lobster tail on a stick, breaded and deep fried. Yummers!\n\nSo imagine my excitement when I found out Lobster ME was expanding and opening a branch in my city!\n\nLike an OG, I let the crowds dissipate and went about a month after it opened. No lines! I got the original Lobster roll  and like a dog in heat i stood by the counter anxiously waiting to sink my teeth into this mammoth lobster roll and finally after a few minutes I hear my name called and I run like a golden retriever ready to fetch that Wham-O frisbee and I grab my plate and wait..what is this? could it be a mistake? I didn't order a kid's size, I want the Adult, full frontal, no-holding-back size. I check with the counterperson and said wait this isn't what I ordered, I ordered the $16 roll. She said that IS the $16 roll. I am not even exaggerating, I thought the roll was for my Teddy Ruxpin it was so small. It was about the length of my iPhone 6 and about as thick as it too.\n\nI'm not saying the roll wasn't good - It was filled with thick chunks of lobster and just the right amount of mayo and seasong, it was definitely YUM but I was disappointed with the size of the aforementioned roll.\n\nOh well, that's why there's a Las Vegas, the biggest little city in the world. \n\nOh wait, that's Reno, nvm.", "author": "Ray R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-11-06", "description": "I can honestly say that this place gets the most solid 3 stars I have ever given.  \n\nI work a few blocks away from Westfield so every now and then I pop over to the mall to do some strolling and shopping.  I almost never eat at the food court as I prefer to cook most of my own food so I have absolute control over the freshness and quality of the ingredients.  Honestly, when I first heard that Lobster Me was coming to the mall, I didn't think much of it.  But strolling by 2 days ago, I noticed Lobster Poutine on the menu and BOOM, I knew I had to try it.  \n\n12pm on a Friday: A few co-workers from my office overheard me talking about this place, and knowing that I'm the official Office Foodie, they wanted to tag along to see what the hype was about.\n\nThe line was quite long and we were initially worried that our lunch would be hurried.  It wasn't.  The line moved quickly and efficiently.  By the time I had gotten to the register, only a few minutes had passed and the cashier was still clearly in training.  They're good.  \n\nNow if you're familiar with the food court in Westfield City Centre, you know that it could be quite the challenge to find a seat, especially for a party larger than one.  Optimists as they are, my coworkers ordered for dine-in.  Smart as I am, I ordered my Lobster Poutine to-go just in case I needed to eat this back at the office.  Luckily, a table close by opened up and we sat down immediately.  \n\nOur group chitchatted about poutine and the French and about how Canada is probably better to live in than the United States.  Within minutes I heard a Filipina woman yell, \"David!\"\n\n---Cue flashback of being scolded by my mother...---  *shudders* \n\nOur food came out rather quickly to our surprise.  We queued, ordered, and collected our food in what seemed be a 10 minute window.  Gordon Ramsay would be pleased at the rate dishes were leaving the kitchen.  It would have been nice having him expedite as well, as here where one star is lost.  \n\nHaving ordered my meal to-go, it came packaged in a to-go container.  After being seated with coworkers, they were quick to notice that it seemed like they had more lobster in their poutines than I, probably because their orders were dine-in and other people in the food court would see how generous the portions were. They even joked that I ate some lobster on the way back to my seat because I couldn't control myself.  It was true, their portions looked a bit more even, but I certainly wasn't going to make a stink about it in front of my colleagues, so I just dove into my meal fork first.\n\nI must say that the Lobster Poutine was better than I expected.  I was a little nervous coming in having read other reviews that mentioned \"soggy fries\" and complained about the gravy. In fact, the poutine was quite delicious.  The fries were cooked nicely and had the right amount of crunch for a poutine.  Not oily or greasy at all.  The lobster may have been on the verge of being overcooked but certainly did not break the plane yet.  The lobster was delicious and moist, and certainly not as rubbery as other reviewers have stated.  The flavors worked very well together and the lobster provided a sense of freshness that you generally don't find with poutine.  The crushed black pepper was the perfect touch to liven up the dish, and added that perfect kick to complement the flavors of lobster and fried potatoes without being overbearing.  Lobster Me loses another star however because I think they could have done much better with the cheese curds.  Other Poutine spots in the Bay Area have come through with great cheese curds, and the curds at Lobster Me are not just there yet.  Don't get me wrong, they're not bad at all.  But knowing what else is out there, they can certainly be improved upon.  \n\nOverall, I had a good experience and the smaller-ish portions of poutine don't make me feel so heavy/guilty/bloated/sleepy/lazy.  But for $12 + tax and tip, having a portion of lobster equal to the dine-in orders would have been great.  I'm going to believe that this was just an honest mistake, and not a case of an establishment taking less pride in their to-go orders as the orders are not visible to every one else.", "author": "David D."}

I've been craving for lobster rolls and saw this at the mall so I decided to try it. I ended up not getting the lobster roll because the the frenchy melt or whatever sounded yummy. I was so excited to try it and when I got it..it didn't look very appetizing. The bread was SUPER BUTTERY and not toasted well. There was way too much cheese and I barely tasted the lobster. It  tasted more of a soggy grilled cheese sandwich smothered in butter. I got French fries on the side and I don't know if it was me but it tasted sour? Like sour and cream but I couldn't tell. The sandwich and fries tasted disgusting and gave me a bad stomach ache. This wasn't worth $15. If it wasn't so buttery and was actually toasted with the right amount of lobster and cheese..then maybe it would be okay.", "author": "Roanne B."}

They didn't close until 8:30 pm.  I then approached the counter and the guy said we're closed.  I asked what time do you close & he said we're closed.  I said you close at 8:30 pm and it's not 8:30 yet and if he could just take one last customer since we drove a good distance just for their lobster roll.  He said no and that he threw everything out and there is nothing left.  I saw int he kitchen area there was food.  He went on to count his till.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-02", "description": "I hardly ever bother to review anything, but this was so disappointing I feel almost obligated to write one. Yesterday, 10/1 I went to the mall specifically to try this place out. I have been craving crab and lobster for a few weeks now. I ordered the lobster melt and added the combo lobster bisque and drink to the order (around $16). The sandwich was small and was mostly cheese with bits of lobster. It was pretty skimpy on the lobster. What bits there were was mixed in with the cheese so that you can't really taste it. Although this was lunch at 3PM or so and I was starving, I was barely able to finish this. The cheesy weirdness of it made it not that appetizing and I love lobster and grill cheese sandwiches in general. The bisque was bland, not very flavorful and there were no lobster chunks or bits of any kind to be found. This whole meal was very disappointing.\n\nGiven that experience you would imagine there's no way I'm going back there. Did I mention that I love lobster? Anyways, so I decided to give it a second chance thinking maybe I just didn't order the right item. It was a little busy when I got there today, but not crazy lines. Just a lot of people waiting around for their food. This time I decided that I was going to go with one of their lobster rolls ($18), more specifically the Beltway roll because I wanted to try something that's a little more flavorful than the bland stuff I got the day before. It was discounted from the $18 due to a special 20% for opening week. It comes with chips and a side of cole slaw. I ordered it to go, but they failed to note that. When I asked for it to be made to go, they grabbed a to go box and placed the paper tray that my food came in inside the box and forgot to add my cole slaw to it so I was short a tiny little cole slaw side when I got back to the office. As you can see from the picture below that the serving itself isn't that big. It's small in comparison to the fork in the picture. The amount of lobster is ok. The taste is still pretty bland and boring. I had to add extra butter and a little siracha sauce to give it a little flavor and kick, otherwise it was just blah.\n\nSo the whole experience was pretty disappointing. I really wanted to like this place since I love lobster, but it was such a dud. Next time I feel like lobster, I think I will take my $18 to a Asian supermarket and grab a 2-3lb lobster (usually about $7-9/lb during lobster season) and cook it up myself. More lobster, more meat, more flavor, my way.\n\nFour words: skimpy, overpriced, tasteless, disappointing.", "author": "Khanh N."}

The lobster meat is basically shredded and resembles canned crab more than fresh lobster, and I DO have a problem with that. I will add the caveat that they are very new and incredibly busy, but the meat was minimal, tiny shreds, neither warm nor cold and the butter was cool enough on my Connecticut roll to have congealed. I added fries to the order, which were also neither warm not cold but definitely limp and unappetizing. This was probably due to them being put in a bowl and set under a heat lamp until enough people ordered fries to use up the bowl. This means if not many people order fries you are guaranteed limp stale fries. I was so looking forward to having lobster rolls near work and certainly didn't expect the quality I have had on the east coast but these were just plain bad. \nUpdate: Decided to return and give this place another chance and I'm glad I did. The service issues still need work- three people who also ordered lobster rolls after me received their orders before me and they got my order wrong. But, they apologized and fixed the order so that's fine. No one is perfect. The food was much improved the lobster had big chunks and was the proper temperature. I didn't order fries because I saw the bowl of fries languishing under the heat lamp and figured they wouldn't be good. Honestly, I didn't need them anyway because the roll was rich and filling and tasted pretty darn good. Not the best lobster roll I've had but I would probably come back!", "author": "Eve C."}

We took some lobsicles and the lobster mac n cheese to go and were excited to try them.  Unfortunately, after we had made the taxi ride across the strip and back to our hotel, we found that they had never put the Mac n cheese in our bag. We were livid after paying so much for the item, and were not going to pay for the taxi ride back. We were done with Lobster Me. \n\nMy mom and I recently found the location in the Westfield mall and I had a craving for lobster. I thought I'd give it one more chance. I told the cashier what had happened in Vegas--just to make conversation and not really with any expectation. He told his manager Robert my story and they comped us the Mac n cheese. The food was fine, and yes, the portions are small. Old Port Lobster Shack is still my go-to place. But this location of Lobster Me definitely won a repeat customer with their kindness and great service--I don't take that for granted these days.", "author": "K L."}

When I finally realized that Lobster Me opened up here, I could not wait to try it, but once I tried it at this location I was beyond disappointed. I got the Old Maine which was decent but it didn't wow me like it did the first time. I also got the clam chowder and that was a waste of money. Though the clams were pretty big in size, it just didn't taste good. The service was alright but they definitely need some work because it just felt like they were flustered. My boyfriend had to go back to them twice because our order didn't come out right. Plus, if you're going to put the sign as apple cider, I expect it to have some carbonation since it is a cider, but it really is just apple juice. I would recommend waiting a couple more months for this place to get into a rhythm so they can establish themselves and then maybe I'll try it again.", "author": "Jenny H."}

But when visiting San Francisco, who wants standard food court fare? After getting kid appropriate food, I got to the Lobster ME just in time for the gal at the counter, who initially completely ignored me, to tell me that she couldn't help me because it was 8:29. No sorry, no offer of an alternative, nothin'. I asked if I could at least get some clam chowder since it was already made, so she rang it up and started dishing up a bowl.\n\nThen a gentleman wearing a blue dress shirt, whom I presume was the manager, came up to the counter and asked how my night was. I was near tears and told him that we'd been on the road all day and because my kids took so long to decide on their food, the only thing I could get from them was clam chowder for my husband. Without hesitation,  he said that wasn't going to happen and helped me decide on a Frenchy Melt.\n\nThis bit of deliciousness is melted brie with huge chunks of lobster grilled on bread. Talk about comfort food!! Bites. Of. Heaven! \n\nMy rating would have been 5 stars if not for the initial interaction. I  get that people are tired and want to go home, but at least ACT like you feel bad! But the man in the blue shirt.... he was my hero for the day! I can't wait to go back and try the lobster mac and cheese.", "author": "Pennye S."}

After ordering, I would say that it took around 10 minutes for me to get my lobster roll. Yes, you are paying almost $20 for a small lobster roll, but what do you expect? It's LOBSTER, and it doesn't come cheap. Do people really think they're going to get a gigantic portion of lobster for only 16-17$ pre-tax? The portions here are actually pretty comparable to the Lobster ME at PH in Vegas. I got the original roll and thought it was delicious. The lobster chunks were meaty and flavorful, but the sides were a no-go. Unlike the PH location, which dishes out great/consistent side items, this particular location fell flat. Half of the chips I received were nice and crispy, but the other half was soggy. The cole slaw was also not good. It was drowned in mayo/dressing and was just not appetizing. \n\nI would come back to get some of their other rolls and melts because the lobster was actually pretty good, but know that you are only paying for the main item since the side dishes are basically inedible.", "author": "Kari G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-10-15", "description": "Do not be tempted by the new \"Lobster Me\" at the Westfield Mall.  Horrible.  I've been twice since they opened three weeks ago.  The first time was kinda off but I wanted to give them a second chance.  In summary: the waits (for food, after you order) are loooong, the chips and (regular) french fries are soggy, there is nothing authentic about the \"Maine\" lobster roll (I lived 70 minutes from the Maine border for 18 years), the lobster mac and cheese is beyond bland, and the lobster melt sandwich should basically be called \"toast\" because its' way more bread than lobster.  Also: operationally, there is clearly a problem.  When you order, you specify a drink but they don't give you the drink with your order.  You have to tell the staff that gave you your food that you ordered a drink, and what the drink was.  All the customers waiting with me (and there were tons) were having this experience - they get their food, they say \"what about my drink?\" and then were asked \"what did you order\" and then they got their drink -- this is after a ridiculously long wait.  So bizarre.  The only halfway decent thing I've tried were the \"chowder fries\" which were kinda salty but still an interesting idea.  And I appreciated that on my first visit I got a 20% discount which I assume was because they'd just opened, but I guess that deal expired by my second visit on Oct 14.  (BTW, I sat next to two other dissatisfied Lobster Me customers in the food court last night - they did not like the food either and thought, like I do, that it was poor value for the money.)  So save your lobster roll budgets for Woodhouse, New England Lobster Company or even Old Port Lobster Shack in Redwood City.  I can only blame myself for thinking a lobster place in a mall food court was a good idea.", "author": "Dave M."}

I decided to go to Walgreens first to buy a soda then came back when the line was shorter. Once i got to the front of the line the \"manager\" opened a separate register to help me. I know they just opened but the girl next to him seemed very confused and literally kept staring off with her mouth wide open ignoring customers. She held a guy's drink for about 30 seconds while he waited just looking at her. Her eyes were open but she just stood there not moving staring off into space. Maybe she was overwhelmed or extremely tired, but a place like this really needs people who are experienced, quick, and eager to help. By this time the line really built up again and several people walked away. I do have to say the original lobster melt and lobster bisque were fantastic! I will definitely return!

Like everything new that opens in SF these days, the prices are way high and the portions are way small.  My lobster roll was, the idea of a lobster roll, but not what anyone in the Northeast would ever call, a lobster roll.  For one, the meat was shredded finely.  I've never experienced this anywhere.  The restaurant's provided image you'll see here showing large chunks of whole lobster meat are not reality, those pictures are decptive.  The second problem here, is not that lobster rolls cost $18.00.  That is typical.  The problem is their $18.00 lobster roll is tiny.  There isn't even half the meat I'm accustomed to getting.  There is a certain Chowdermobile that travels around SF delivering rolls with huge chunks overflowing out of a roll twice as big - go there.  Since I'm still hungry, and have half the workday still to get through and no time to have a second lunch, I won't be back to this place.  I never go back to places that leave me feeling hungry.

The Clam Chowder was by far superior to Boudin's, nice big chunks of clam meat and very smooth and creamy, even though they don't have a sourdough bread bowl!  I loved it!  I also had the original Melt... basically a grilled cheese with crab and it was delicious, rich and quite filling.  It was grilled to perfectly so crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside... what more could you want? =)   Then on my way out I stopped to compliment the team on the food and the service and say thank you.  I was then offered to try the Cajun Lobster Roll.  I was hesitant because of being so full already but who can refuse free lobster???  not me!!!   =)  I did however wait some time before trying it so it was cold but it was still absolutely delicious so I can only imagine how good it was hot.  It was very meaty, the spice was just right (flavorful and a touch of heat but didn't burn your mouth). for those who want fewer calories than the Original Melt, this sandwich can't be beat!
