Given that I love lobster rolls I had to give it a try.\n\nFirst off, it is a traditional east  coast lobster roll. The kind that you would find out on Long Island or Boston or Maine. Split top bun toasted in butter, lobster meat with a choice of either butter or seasoned mayo. That's it. No lettuce, no tomato, nothing else. This is not a Chicago hot dog it is a lobster roll. I went with the traditional butter and for the extra meat option for $6 more. The regular is $14. Perfection! Bun Perfect. Lobster meat was impeccably fresh, tender and succulent -- Perfect. Did I say it was perfect? Sorry no picture -- it did not last long enough.\n\nAs for the Yelpers with their low ratings primarily about the size or the cost, I am sorry to put it this way, but what planet are you from?! This is fresh chunked lobster, not tuna salad. Lukes Lobster, the lobster shack that I judge all grab and go lobster rolls by is $16 in Las Vegas and New York City for 4 oz of meat on a split top butter toasted bun. This is San Francisco and the Lobsta Truck's roll is $14! \n\nIf you want a sit down place, check out Waterbar, Leo's Oyster Bar or Sauce Belden. All are excellent, perhaps a little more meat but you better be prepared to anti up some real coin -- $25 - 35 range plus all of the costs of eating in a restaurant. Lobster Me on the other hand is $24 and is the worst lobster roll I have ever had. Bun was stale and I swear the meat was previously frozen or just old -- defiantly not fresh. It is in a food court setting though, so if you are looking for a plastic chair and a table that was cleaned a couple of hours ago whether it needed it or not and surrounded by screaming kids have at it.\n\nThe Lobsta Truck is a bargain for those that know what a true lobster roll should be.", "author": "John C."}

Yes, indeed I do. Did I love the lobsta from the \"Lobsta Truck\"?! Um... naw, not really. I didn't \"love\" it, but when you're hangry... anything goes. \n\nIt was a Wednesday evening... aka lobster truck night for yours truly, and I set out to get my lobster truck fix at the Off the Grid one night. I frequent the Cousin's Maine Lobster truck religiously, so I came with the intention of grabbing a lobster roll from my old and faithful. \n\nTo my dismay, lil ol' Cousin's wasn't there that night. You could say that I had a minor heart attack after that realization... and then I saw it: the \"Lobsta\" truck. I hadn't remembered ever trying it before, so I was excited to try a roll from a newbie. To my surprise, there was only one person ahead of me.\n\n I examined the menu and noticed that they carried many favorites; lobster rolls, clam chowder, and lobster bisque. The lobster roll was $14 which is actually cheaper than Cousin's $17 price tag. That was a good sign in itself... or so I thought. I put my order in at the window and the kind lady who took my order gave me a number. I ordered a single lobster roll and decided to get a snack from another truck to go along with it.\n\nIt didn't take long for my order and when I received it, I noticed that the lobster looked... different. Visually, it wasn't the most appealing. I was hungry... I'm sorry, I was \"hangry\", so I didn't really wasn't worried too much about how it looked. \n\nI took my first bite and I can't really say what it was, but something just tasted off. The flavor was just... weird. It almost tasted like imitation lobster. The consistency was unusual and the lobster didn't taste the freshest. I could taste the butter and I did really enjoy the crispy roll, but it did nothing to mask that unusual taste. It wasn't gross but it just didn't taste... right. Maybe it wasn't fresh?! It definitely wasn't what I was used to. The portion size was also pretty small for the price.  \n\nWhen I was done eating it, I felt the urge to gargle or to eat something else to get that taste out of my mouth. I guess I'm just spoiled by Cousin's Maine because the Lobsta Truck's rolls can't even touch the quality of Cousin's rolls. I'm hoping that it was just an off day for them, but I'll probably just continue to go to Cousin's in the meantime. The  quality and taste of their lobster rolls are just so much better in my opinion.", "author": "Shayla B."}

I can never have enough lobster rolls, but this is the worst one ever had. Here's what I think about the food, \n\n1) The bread was ok but they put too much butter so it's quite oily. 2) it's a really really small roll, not as big as a Asian female's palm. The smallest ever had. 3) it's $14+tax, total $15.3. I can get a really good and reasonable size lobster roll at wood house fish company or crabsters for less than $3 more and way better. 4) not much lobster in there, part of the lobster taste either not fresh or didn't cook well. \n\nAlthough the cook was pretty nice and wrapped my roll with tin foil since I couldn't hold the paper plate, I would never recommend this place if you are trying to get a reasonable priced lunch.", "author": "Gemma C."}

In any other State, I have to specify Connecticut-style to emphasize that it's not that abomination with cold lobster meat and mayonnaise.  Here, they don't try to partake in the debate and just offer the lobster roll both ways: the right way (butter) and the wrong way (mayo).  I upgraded to the extra meat for another $6 (for a grand total for $20/roll) and got a very healthy portion of lobster (compared to lobster roll norms).  They used a split bun and it was lightly toasted on both sides.  This is probably the closest to home I've had while living in California.  My only suggestion would be slightly hotter lobster and a tad more butter, but generally it is well ahead of the competition.\n\nLobster Bisque: The soup itself was very tasty, creamy and filled with real lobster flavor.

This, my friends, is NOT the \"real deal\"!!\n\nI had anticipated something better.  I waited in line for almost 20 minutes.  And I even ordered the \"extra lobster meat\" option.  But alas, what I received was a barely-filled roll of watery, bland, semi-minced lobster meat.  Sigh.  People, making a proper lobster roll isn't rocket science.  You only need two, maybe three ingredients:  Lobster, mayo or butter, salt.  That's really it.  Okay, some of you like some celery in there...that's okay, I guess, as long as the chunks aren't too big.  But you definitely don't want to add celery seeds or lemon juice or anything excessively pungent like that...Lobster is a subtle, sweet meat, and like many other delicacies from the sea, is easily over-powered by forthright seasonings.\n\nHowever, this wasn't really a problem here.  The problem was that the meat was flavorless (I'm guessing previously frozen?), watery, and if there was mayo or salt or any seasoning whatsoever, I couldn't really detect it.\n\nAnd most of all, I was incensed that I paid over $20 for an \"extra meat\" lobster roll that was barely a regular lobster roll.  Seriously??  I pay $6.50 for a lobster roll that size at Stop & Shop on Martha's Vineyard.  \n\nThere's just no good excuse.  I get that it's a delicacy and those cost money.  I get that your meat probably comes from a freezer.  But honestly?  If you're charging that much for a lobster roll, it really should be MUCH better than that one was.\n\nI won't be back to this food truck...I consider it to be a waste of money.  If I need a lobster roll, I'll either pony up the bucks at the Woodhouse Fish Co., or buy a lobster at the Chinese fish store down the street and make it myself.  I guarantee mine will be 1000% tastier than the one I got  from Lobsta Truck!!!", "author": "Amy L."}

They are present every other week at Off The Grid Pleasant Hill on Wednesday evenings, and I've enjoyed their rolls many times!  They are an excellent place to get your lobster fix, and trust me, with many pretenders out there, this is extremely high praise.  Lobsta Truck is the real goods!\n\nIn terms of authenticity, they are on point - toasted and lightly buttered New England style sandwich rolls, stuffed with large and well-cooked lobster chunks, and you can get it tossed with mayo or butter (Connecticut style).  Their standard roll is $14 and is decent size for the price (for anyone who gripes, lobster is a top shelf item.  It doesn't matter that it's coming off a food truck - this is fresh seafood that has to be flown in from the other side of the damn country, and cooked properly - if you cringe at the price, MOVE ON).  You can get your roll beefed up with some extra lobster for another $6, though I always opt to keep it original - I'm just happy to be getting my fix!  I've devoted a LOT of time, paycheck and gas mileage to seeking out a proper lobster roll, and the wares at Lobsta Truck is worth all of it.  Every other week, I venture down to Off The Grid, order up a lobster roll (or two!) and a bottle of Maine Root blueberry soda, and for those precious bites and sips, I am in true heaven.  \n\nLobsta Truck is legit, and I thank them for serving up a delicious and authentic product daily!  You keep this California girl very happy!", "author": "Terri N."}

Like Nom Nom Truck and MeSoHungry, they've come a long way from SoCal.\n\nBasically if you're looking for simple Lobster Rolls with no bells and whistles then this is the truck for you.  Their menu is really straightforward.  For the Rolls you have a choice to pick between Lobster or Crab and to dress it with either Mayo or Butter.  For $13-14 you get a decent sized Roll.  They give you option to add more meat for $5 more if you're really hungry.  But for me, their standard size Rolls are good enough.  They also have Clam Chowder and Lobster Bisque which you can order a cup or a big bowl.\n\nLobsta Roll with Butter --  http://bit.ly/PVQHRq\nI'd probably compare this to Luke's Lobster in NYC.  The brioche roll is slightly smaller than Sam's or New England but they definitely give you a fair share of Lobster.\n\nCrab Roll with Mayo --  http://bit.ly/1glp7ll\nFor a dollar less, you can pick up the Crab Roll.  Like the Lobster Roll, they give a good amount of lump Crab meat.  This in my opinion is the better of the two.  It might be because I'm more of a Crab fan than a Lobster fan.\n\nI'll have to come back again to try their soups.  I wouldn't mind coming back to visit the Lobsta Truck as their rolls are pretty legit, cheaper than other Lobster Food Trucks, fresh, and rightly sized, especially if you visit them at any Food Truck events.", "author": "Rodney H."}

There were about 5 people in front of me and, by the time I ordered my lobster roll with butter, 6 people behind. The cashier was friendly and took my order.  5 minutes later, I was passed my lobster roll. Although it can be considered small, remember that you're buying from a food truck. Most items here are going to be smaller portioned and more expensive. \n\nI took a bite of the perfectly crispy \"bun\" (no, it isn't a hot dog bun...think more like a well-defined grilled cheese) and into the lobster. The lobster was fresh with that notable \"crunch\" that you get when you know your seafood wasn't frozen. It probably took me about 5 or 6 bites to finish it...and then a couple more to eat what had fallen out into the tray. \n\nWould I go back?

The lobster was nothing special and the portion was SO SMALL that I was still starving afterwards.  I really wished it had more intricacy so I could at least feel like I'm getting my money's worth.

When I found out about Lobsta Truck, I got so excited and decided to visit one of their trucks right away. Luckily, one of their trucks is part of Alameda Off The Grid. \n\nWhen I got there, around 2p, the line was really long and they're out of their lobster bisque. After waiting in line for around 15 minutes, it was finally my turn. I ordered 2 lobster rolls, one with mayo and one with butter. I waited for another 10 minutes for my food and finally....\n\nI was so disappointed when I opened my bag, they're so tiny! Yes they are filled with lobster, but the lobster was really chewy. It's probably the fat of the lobster. There's also absolutely no flavor in them! It's basically just lobster fat and bread. With the price that they charge for, it's totally not worth it. Not even to satisfy a craving!\n\nI guess my mission of finding a good lobster roll in CA will continue.", "author": "Cathy B."}

I had been dying to try it ever since I read about it's entry into the food truck scene in the OC Register. I was so sad when I saw the huge line for it at the event, but I was determined to try it so I waited patiently until I could order.\n\nThey have two main items that they serve on their menu - the \"lobsta\" roll and the crab roll. They have a few other items such as clam chowder, desserts and drinks as well, but my eyes were on the lobsta roll. The lobsta roll is fresh lobsta meat on a toasted split top roll and you can get it with either mayo or butter. For $12, I thought it would be bigger so I was a little disappointed to see that it wasn't that big (hehehe, I can't help myself - *insert \"that's what she said\" joke). Nonetheless, the lobsta roll tasted bombbb. The bread was toasted just right and the lobsta meat wasn't drenched in butter, just enough to give it the additional flavor.\n\nService was excellent. The guys in the truck were super nice. I guess one of them heard it was another customer's birthday so when he called up her order, he also gave her a whoopie pie for free as a birthday gift. Overall, yes, the food here is really good, but for the price, it's sorta meh, since the one roll won't fill you up and you'll leave still hungry.

They serve nothing but Lobster and Crab Rolls, prepacked potato chips, and drinks.  Nothing more, nothing less.  \n\nI opted for the Lobster Roll, since that is what the truck is named after.  For $12, you get a 6\" split-top roll that has been gratuitously buttered and grilled.  I opted to have my lobster dressed with butter instead of mayo because I wanted the clean taste of the lobster to come through.  Each bite was to be savored.  It was nothing but butter, firm meat, and crispy bread.  Admittedly, there is a lot of butter in this dish so if you are shy about that, maybe you should ask for mayo.  Not like that would be less rich.  \n\nA part of me wishes that the truck would expand its offerings and make itself into a seafood shack.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-09-01", "description": "I see a lot of reviews complaining about the amount of food you get.\n\nHere's my reality:\n\nToday I hadn't eaten anything all day (not even a glass of water) and so this was the first food I ate (at 5pm). I had a lobster roll, extra meat, with butter, and a cup of lobster bisque.\nI weigh 235 pounds (on a bad day), I can eat 4 pieces of Costco pizza, or 2 Big Macs plus a 20-piece nuggets in a single sitting, and folks, this was plenty of food (remember, I had an empty stomach going into this, too). In fact, as I neared the end of the lobster roll, I thought to myself \"even if this thing had a bit less meat, I'd be completely satisfied.\" And then I realized I still had the bisque. \n\nSo why the discrepancy? Part of it might be that if you've ever had lobster in a restaurant (like the actual animal, steamed in its shell), you realize that there isn't really THAT much meat in a 1.5 pound lobster. It's mostly shell. So I have to say I was impressed when I got the lobster roll that the amount of meat that was there (with the extra meat option) seemed like the majority of what's inside most lobsters. Lobster is dense meat. It's like eating filet mignon. You can't compare the quantity of lobster or filet mignon to the quantity of microwave popcorn you get in a bag. \n\nThe toast was perfectly prepared and the butter was plentiful (and I'm a guy who doesn't scrape off the big scoop of butter they put on the Denny's pancakes). The taste was what made this for me. I did not mind spending $20. I've had less satisfying meals in restaurants where my meal exceeded $20.\n\nThe $7 for the cup of bisque? I didn't find that item worth it. It was \"ok\" but not memorable. There were no bits of lobster (I expected at least something), and the bisque wasn't as creamy as I expect.\n\nIt seemed like the wait was longer than it should have been, but I wasn't in any hurry.

Very yum and I'm not even a huge fan of these scavengers of the sea. \n\nThe Lobsta (spelled to be pronounced with that very annoying New England accent)Truck was parked in front of the OC Mix, a part of the South Coast Collection maze of shops off the 405 in Costa Mesa. This location was a key part of making this a def hit. Walk your order of choice into the OC Mix building where the always hilarious and sometimes sarcastic Phil will await you at We Olive with vino and beer. He not only recommended the perfect chardonnay to accompany the lobster, he also gave us some garlic olive oil to add on. Wow, thanks Phil! Man did that kick it up several notches. \n\nThey have trucks parked here every Saturday as well as Tues and Thurs, and according to Phil they mix it up with dif trucks each week. We arrived at 11:30 yesterday to 6 or 7 trucks and it was pretty dead. Sweet.\n\nThe staff manning the Lobsta Truck are very cool and funny and my roll was handed to me in a mere 5 minutes. No painfully long waits here, not yet anyway. One lobster roll, one bag of Cape Cod chips and one Chard from We Olive = $27 inc tips. As I mentioned to my friends: 27 bucks and I'm not even full or buzzed. \n\nSo yeah, not a casual Saturday lunch that I will be repeating any time soon, but it was fun for a one off.

With you and your loyal mass followers ... who flock to every siting ... I was able to stroll up to the Lobsta Truck behind two other eager patrons ... allowing me just enough time to make my order selection for the night.\n\nThe menu is simple: Lobster Roll, Crab Roll, Clam Chowder. I was so tempted to get all three ... but i decided \"I need other dishes to get me back\".  So, this being my virgin run ... I went for the Lobster Roll.\n\nAfter I ordered ... i waited less than 5 minutes (no, I didn't time it) before they called out my name.  Ahh, my Lobster roll and Fresh Lemonade was ready.  As I reached for my meal from the high window counter and lowered it to eye level ... i noticed my meal getting bigger, but by not much.  Other reviews were not kidding; the stuffed roll was so petite, I could easily eat two, if not three. But at $12 each ... this food truck delight could turn easily into a $40 meal.\n\nAs I walked back to my car to enjoy my hand sized roll stuffed with lobster covered with grade aaa butter ... I was guessing how many bites it would take to finish (three? four??).\n\nIt took me about 5 -6 bites but i truly lost count because once i took that first bite into the perfectly toasted roll ... my mouth was in heaven.\n\nThe Lobster was very fresh, so much that I swear I smelled salt water ... and with the meat so tender, either it was flown in fresh that day ... or they really tenderized it! Either way ... it was divine!\n\nI am a fan for sure, but my wallet says \"um, let's wait til next pay day\".\n\nIf this was at a sit down place where I can enjoy my meal while soaking up some Maine Lobsta culture ... I'd say well worth the price. But coming from a food truck that I trekked over to find and to eat the meal ... either in my car or like other patrons ... standing around in a circle like black crows attacking it's last meal ...

But in true foodie fashion, I will jump right off the bandwagon the second the novelty of an experience overshadows the food.  \n\nYesterday I ventured to a local high school's fundraiser here in Fullerton anticipating a number of food trucks to try with some friends.  The Lobsta Truck was our first stop.  Expecting to order from several different trucks that day, we all hesitated when we saw the prices here.  $12 for the lobster roll and $11 for the crab roll.  But we wanted good lobster and weren't disheartened.  One of our group left to drive around town and find an ATM.  (We found out after he left that they accept credit cards).\n\nWe ordered two lobster rolls with butter and one clam chowder (the clam chowder was a reasonable $4).  The food was ready in literally one minute, which was surprising.  The first thing we instantly noticed was the small size of the sandwiches.  Despite how it may look in pictures, it's about the size of a small hotdog.  Not a good first impression to a hungry group intending to share.  \n\nAfter my first bite, I realized why the sandwich was ready so fast.  It was served cold, which wasn't what I'd been expecting.  I can see how this makes sense from a business standpoint.  It's certainly easier to precook and separate lobster for quick serving later.  All they had to do was grill bread on the spot.  But for lobster, the quality suffers while the price remains high.  I'd rather go to a nice seafood restaurant.  When our friend returned from the ATM, we told him to save his $12 for another truck.  \n\nI reject the idea in other Yelpers' posts of \"It's lobster!  Of course it's expensive\".  If it were truly amazing lobster, I doubt anybody reviewing here would have an issue with the price.  \n\n**Sidenote:  I didn't get to try the clam chowder, but I'm told it was \"pretty good\" and not too salty.

Nothing in Maine, however. Obviously, it's a bit unfair to compare to Lobsta Truck, in both price, value, and flavor. But there's at least some type of reference to draw from during my 3 bites of Lobsta Truck's lobsta roll.\n\nAfter opening up a half hour late to a massive line (I could see one of the workers inside mouthing OMG with bulging eyes once the door opened), orders finally started. Of course, there was drama already. They were handing out food at random order, annoying a lot of people, and I overheard a lady complaining about how small the lobster roll was. The guy at the front snapped at her and said \"you can hand it over, we can give your money back.\" I didn't know we were also supposed to be getting the Boston 'tude to go along with the food!\n\nI fork over $24 in cash for two lobster rolls, one with butter and one with mayo. The food comes out, and my wife and I waste little time in sinking our teeth into these lobster rolls. After trying both the mayo and butter versions, I'd have to give the edge to the butter version. The buttah just enhanced the lobsta meat flavor, while the mayo didn't really bring anything to the table. If anything, it was more bland. It desperately needed more seasoning. \n\nYes, the lobster rolls are small. It took me 3 bites to finish one. There could've been a bit more meat -- it's an illusion that the meat is overflowing from the roll, because they don't really fill the bottom part of the roll (so you're getting a little bite of air). The lobster meat itself was tender, and you can actually differentiate between the tail and claw meat by the texture and chewiness of each bite.\n \nI'm a huge seafood lover -- lobster, crab, shrimp, you name it -- and I'm not afraid to pay good money for good food. With the long lines, it looks like I'm not the only one. But hey, I get the appeal. It's LOBSTER. But my main gripe is that the lobster roll lacked any soul, if that makes sense. There's no point in trying to replicate an authentic lobster roll, so why not give it a SoCal twist? Perhaps introduce new ingredients, new flavors, bring something new to the game.

I should have been more specific.\n\nThe roll itself was about half the meat of what you expect for this kind of thing. I'm comparing it the tourist trap lobster/crab roll shops at the Pier, so our bar is already quite low. It was about 4 bites of food, 1 if you're feeling industrious. It tasted only a bit below average, which is to say it was good, which is to say it wasn't worth $13.\n\nI guess I understand why \"side\" means \"largest size\" to them. I should have gotten a side cheeseburger from the next truck over. Maybe a nice side entire ham? A side decision to order from somewhere else to begin with? Too far?\n\nThe soup tasted fine, but it didn't really live up to the \"clam\" part of the promise. Sure it was chowder, but this isn't grad school; 50% is still an F. It was on par with canned soup from Safeway. \n\nSo, yeah, $21 for a can of soup and a wisp of seafood. A solid \"meh\".", "author": "Andy M."}

The big knock against it is the price, but that's somewhat expected when you are eating lobster (I'd actually be more suspicious if it was really cheap). If you're a big eater and you're hungry (which I happened to be today when I got the roll), you'll probably have to get at least 2, which for lunch is a bit pricey. I just got one to try and went somewhere else to get more food so I don't have to drop another $14 for lunch. Clam chowder was good, but I happened to be walking by the truck one time when they were closing and they just gave it to me for free. It was amazing for a free chowder, but maybe not as much for a $5 chowder. If I didn't account for the price, I'd probably give it a 4 star rating.

This past Friday, they were part of the food truck meet up in Fullerton in the Best Buy parking lot on Imperial and Harbor. Food roundup:\n\nLobster roll: Comes on a traditional grilled split roll (not hotdog bun), with big chunks of chilled lobster meat (I think tail and claw). Got half mayo and half butter. I liked the butter side a tad more since it gave it a salty kick the mayo side was missing. The lobster was cooked perfectly and it tasted really fresh and clean.\n\nLowdown: Great place for your lobster roll fix, reasonable price for the amount of lobster you get. Granted, this is not going to get you completely full, but hey, it's a lobster roll for $12. The meat wasn't as sweet as the one I had in NYC, but lobster is cooked well. I'll be back, mmmm! Also from their website: AS A RESULT, LIKE THE LOBSTER, WE GET OUR BREAD FRESH FROM NEW ENGLAND, score!\n\n**For all you concerned with price: You're getting high quality lobster for a decent price! When I was in NYC, you'd be lucky to find any place with a roll for less than $25, a lot of places there start around $25-$32 for a bit larger roll with fries in a sit down place. Even Luke's Lobster in NYC, a modest order at the counter joint charges $15. Just to give some perspective for all you not familiar with how much these things run (outside of Maine which I imagine is cheaper). \n\nReality check: If you want to get full off a lobster roll with at least 1/2 lb of meat in it or more, you gotta pay more than $12!!!!\n\nhttp://laist.com/2010/07/22/lobster_rolls.php#photo-1", "author": "Jackie P."}

FOr some reason I imagined sizzling lobster on a hot roll. But overall everything was kind of cold, so I was a little sad, but I guess that's how it is? No idea actually. Anyway, that's why I'm giving it three stars. Not because the service was terrible or the food was bad. I'm just not that big of a fan I guess.", "author": "Joy K."}

Lobster was fresh bread was excellent and had a nice little toast to it.  Perfect amount of butter (not too much) and a pretty good amount of lobster.  Basic and very good.  The service was good too.  Received food fast and girls were friendly and nice.\n\nThere are a few things that keep this truck from being a 4.5/5 star truck.  The main one is the prices.  The lobsta roll is 12 bucks (crab roll 11).  That is just too pricey for a 5 inch sandwich.  I know quality lobster is expensive and they do give you a pretty good amount of meat but 8 to10 bucks would be a fair price for what they are serving.\n\nVery good truck (above avg) but not spectacular, overpriced, but I would like to try the crab roll and the clam chowder if I ever get the chance to go back.", "author": "Mr W."}

I understand lobster and crab is expensive, but this place still over charges for what it is. I had both the lobsta and crab roll.....There isn't a whole lobster or crab on it, its more like 1/2. The taste isn't really great either, over buttered and the bread gets soagy fast. You are much better off going to the supermarket and making it yourself.", "author": "James C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-16", "description": "I finally tried a lobsta sandwich yesterday, and I was quite impressed.  The lobsta meat is stuff into a roll that is lightly buttered with garlic.   You can order the sandwich with either mayo or butter.  Or you can order a mayo sandwich with butter on the side.  Light mayo is another option as well.  While the chucks of meat are very large, the sandwich is very small.  It's about the size of a hot bun and it will not fill you up if you're hungry.  For $12, I expect a bigger sandwich but that's the only real drawback.  The sandwich is delicious.  The bun compliments the meat perfectly.  I ordered the light mayo sandwich and it had a light creamy taste without feeling artery clogging.  Be warned, the wait is very long.  I visited the truck at Irvine Lanes which had several other trucks there.  None of the other trucks had a line except for the Lobsta Truck which was about a 40 minute wait.  I'm not sure any sandwich is worth a 40 minute wait but YMMV.", "author": "Steve L."}

That being said, I don't think this lobster roll is expensive because it is a lobster roll! Unless you are right in a fishing town where they trap lobster, it will always be expensive.

Headed over to SOCO farmer market to check-out the line-up of trucks and knew I wanted some seafood. The line was not too long but once my food came out the crowd began to grow. Ordered the Lobsta roll and lemonade. You think pricey for a $12 sandwhich but once you take a bite of the crispy bead with lobster it's totally worth every dollar. Got the roll with butter, not a big fan of mayo. The lobster meat tasted fresh and the bread was perfectly toasted. Washed it down with the lemonade and it hit the spot.

Definitely try it. Another classic item to order from their menu is the Lobster roll. It's lobser wrapped in a some kind of bread roll with either mayo, butter, or both. This is also a definite must try. The only thing that caught my attention was the price and the size of the lobster roll. The lobster roll is $12 and it pretty small.

I paid $14 for a lobster roll, and the small size of it was a shock. Some pictures posted by the other users don't properly convey the scale, so the best description I can think of is this: The folded paper tray they put the sandwich in is used as condiment containers at other restaurants. I'd say the bun is about 4 inches long, and the whole sandwich was gone in three bites. As a standalone review, I would have given them 3.5 stars, but I bumped it down because I felt the 5-star reviews needed some countering here.", "author": "J. P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-07", "description": "I was honestly a little disappointed with this truck, especially considering that I was looking forward to it so much before today. I was aware of the prices even before today so they weren't a surprise when I saw them. The big letdowns were the portions and, well, the amount of flavor. Don't get me wrong, I love lobster with every bit of my being. I love its natural buttery richness and the orgy is creates in your mouth when you add actual butter on top of it. However, the butter lobster roll just didn't really do it for me. It was definitely buttery but I guess I was just expecting some other flavors to be present besides butter, so to me it seemed rather bland and boring. Also, as I mentioned, the portion of the sandwich was extremely small in my opinion; all they did was put some chunks of lobster in a buttered-up slice of normal bread and served it. It was really nothing special. Price usually doesn't bother me, but $12 for what I got was a little ridiculous. I think $8 or $9 would be a bit more reasonable.\n\nI am definitely not trying to discourage others from trying the Lobsta truck, I am simply giving a heads up to those who might actually think twice about these kinds of things. While I was a little disappointed overall, there are still other things I would like to try on their menu such as the clam chowder, and for that I will give them another try.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I have to admit that lobster doesn't float my boat as much as it does other people so if you're one of them take my review with a grain of salt.  My wife and I picked up the crab and lobsta rolls when the truck was in Fullerton tonight.  Pay attention to when they say they're serving cause even though they're there 30 minutes prior (as is their fan line), they don't open until they're good an ready, which  tonight was 5 minutes later than advertised.  \nOnce they are open, the system runs pretty efficiently and the service is friendly.  We ended up getting 2 rolls apiece which fills you up, but not over the top.  The bread is a little overbuttered for my taste, however.  All in all, $46 for the two of us.  If it were $30, I'd give it 4 stars but overall, the quality was good.", "author": "Andrew P."}
