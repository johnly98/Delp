The menu's pretty straightforward brunch food. I got the potato hash with the carnitas+tomatillo ($13) which was a hefty meal. \n\nThe potatoes are thickly cut and seasoned with quite a bit of heat on it. The carnitas were sprinkled on top and supplemented the potatoes well, but I didn't think it was particularly memorable. The poached egg was cooked *perfectly* which I always appreciate. That said, I would suggest splitting this bowl and another dish with a friend-- the serving size of the potatoes were huge and hard to finish.", "author": "Tien L."}

The egg muffins were good, to be honest, I was starving and so I was happy to eat almost anything. \n\nThe place was a little warm inside, I didn't realize this until I stepped outside and realized it was colder outside than it was inside (and it was a hot day).

The addition of avocados was nice but the $3 surcharge was a bit steep for the amount we got.\n\nHeirloom Tomato Tartine ($14)\nThe tartine was one slice of bread that had a moderate layer of pesto topped with two tomato slices, healthy amount of burrata, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar. This dish was extremely good: the bread was well toasted, the tomatoes were fresh, the burrata was plenty, and the pesto well seasoned. The addition of the balsamic really brought all these ingredients together. I would highly recommend this.\n\nA great lunch spot if you're looking for something light with great, awesome flavors.

I was headed to a different place for breakfast/brunch but when I drove past it was empty AF so I decided to keep driving and end up somewhere else. I parked the car and saw Parker on the corner of 18th and Missouri. I am glad that I chose this spot. It's nice, the food is tasty and it doesn't break the pockets. The service is awesome. The fella that takes your order acknowledges everyone and had great recommendations. I love a place that knows its menu. But what really took it from 3 stars to 4 stars was the music that they were playing. Prolly dating myself but the song \"Young Hearts Run Free\" by Candi Staton came on and it reminded me of dancing around my house with my mother back in da day.....Aayyyeee.

There's bar seating and just a few small tables for two. It doesn't seem to get too crowded so if you gave up waiting for Plow, it's a good option. \n\nBrunch is served until 3 PM. For the most part, they have tartines using sourdough bread from Jane Bakery. I was a bit sad to find there were not a lot of GF friendly options so we opted for the Quinoa Bowl & smoothies.\n\nQuinoa Bowl ($9) Kale, mushroom, onion, turkey bacon, feta, red pepper flakes, poached egg. Honestly tasted extremely basic and plain. Most of the bowl was just quinoa and I was hoping for more of the other listed ingredients. The bacon was not that great and came in tiny little slices too. The egg was poached nicely but that was about it. Super overpriced and don't recommend getting!\n\nAlmond Butter Tartine ($6) - Honey, cinnamon, fresh fruit, chia seeds. Tasted good but not great.\n\nGreen Butter Smoothie ($10) - Almond milk, spinach, banana, vanilla, almond butter, maca, maple syrup. This was the only thing I liked here, it tasted great! I got it without the maple syrup since I thought that would make it too sweet and felt like that was a pretty good decision. Its a pretty steep price for a smoothie that doesn't even have protein in it though...\n\nPitaya Smoothie ($8) - Pitaya, banana, strawberry, raspberry, coconut water. Tasted super tart and really didn't like this drink. Do not get.\n\nOverall I had a really mediocre experience here, and I probably won't be back unless I swipe on a free Tinder brunch. The food is pretty photogenic, I'll give it that, but at a high cost.", "author": "Chelsea W."}

All the different flavors and textures (can we take a moment to admire the colors?!) went so well together, and everything tasted super fresh.\n\nThe portions here are definitely very generous so even though $15 for a salad is a bit pricey and quite bougie, I would for sure come back for the Parker salad and to try their bowls (served for breakfast, until 11:00am) and tartines which I've heard great things about also. Other than that, the service was good and the place is really clean - very solid brunch/lunch spot! Oh, and my colleague got the smoked salmon salad ($15) and she really enjoyed that too. \n\nOverall, very good food but a bit on the expensive side (-0.5 stars).", "author": "Angela C."}

I remember my days of living in my car and coming here to this neighborhood for skyscraping views of the city and one day dreaming of having my own place, enjoying a good meal, and even having a good cup of tea. \n\nFast forward 7 years, Potrero Hill will always have a special place in my heart. \n\nNow, coming to Parker Potrero, this establishment is fairly new. I remember it being a previous voice studio. Now that it's here, it's been a lovely addition to the neighborhood. \n\nWhen you enter, the cafe is bright and airy with open style barstool seating with additional restaurant seating further to the back. Being 9 in the morning, they offered an extensive breakfast menu along with smoothies and fresh squeeze juices.\n\nWhat I ordered:\n\nSlowly recovering from a cold, I still had a bit of a cough. I went with the C-Boost juice to raise my immunity fighting capability. This lovely juice consisted of orange, grapefruit, lemon, lime, strawberry, and maple syrup. This tasted especially refreshing and gave me a quick pick me up. \n\nI also ordered the Green Dragon tea for comfort. \n\nEgg muffins - these little guys are a great concept, but could've used a teeny more salt (personal preference). The eggs were scrambled and then baked into a muffin tin and served alongside crispy potatoes and some toast, no jam, but they did offer honey. \n\nMy most favorite, however, is their quinoa bowl. Filled with warm quinoa, turkey bacon, feta cheese, mushrooms, onion, kale, and a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, all topped with a perfectly poached egg. DELICIOUS! Make sure to mix it all together for that perfect bite!\n\nService was extremely friendly and quick. \n\nI'm really happy this cafe opened up and brought into fruition what I'd always thought I'd experience in the city!", "author": "Ann S."}

I ordered the smoked salmon tartine, and it was simply a manifestation of perfection! For some reason I expected the tartine to be dry and sourdoughy based on the way it looked, but it was actually crunchy on the outside and super soft on the inside. Typically I am not a fan of arugula at all because of the grassy taste it has, but the sourness of pickled onions and capers canceled that grassy taste and thus made the dish 10x more refreshing and enjoyable for me. Coupled with the crunch of the arugula and pickled onions, the fat of the salmon and spread kept the texture of the dish buttery and smooth; every bite felt like an explosion of various tastes and textures in my mouth.\n\nI also got the hangover cure juice, which was pretty unique as well.

I had an open faced smoked salmon with herbed cream cheese sandwich. It came on a big slice of rustic bread, lots of fresh greens, pickled red onion, herbs and a small side salad. \n\nMy friend had the Cubano sandwich and I don't eat meat so I'm going by how it looked, smelled and how he liked it. His plate was clean, like squeaky so we can say he liked it. Meat, pickles, cheeeeeeeze, a sauce that smelled really good. I don't know what else but it was piled high and pretty luscious looking.\n\nHis wife had the quinoa salad and finished it off. Which is impressive because it was a big sized salad. She's eaten there before and says the Parker Salad is phenomenal. That's my next order!\n\nWe split another sandwich, can't remember the name but it was avocado and cucumber ribbons and watercress and a harissa oil with some crunchy hemp seeds. Really really rich and refreshing.\n\nJust go, you'll be really happy you did!", "author": "H. H. M."}

However, I had a less than pleasant experience with one of the female workers. There was an item missing from my meal that I was told the restaurant was out of. However the table that ordered a good bit after me had it. \n\nI went to the front to bring that up. From the second I flagged the issue the woman at the front had attitude and was aggressive. If she had just said 'I'm sorry about the confusion' I would have been fine. But instead she said 'I don't know what else to do for you. We refunded you your money What else do you want us to do?' 'Ma'am I didn't know you had refunded my entire meal to me.'  \n\nThe attitude wasn't necessary and considering I wasn't giving her attitude or being rude I'm confused as to why she was rude.\n\nI'm hoping that the reason for her aggression has to do with her having a bad day instead what my gut thinks it really is about, the skin color of the guest.", "author": "Nnena U."}

I do love the concept - simple light healthy food, delicious coffee and juice to be had, not to mention beer and wine when I need my fix.  Loved the tartines I've tried, and the service has been, for the most part, above and beyond.  I did however have an awkward exchange one time when I stopped in for a coffee. It was a scorching SF day, like the ones we've been having lately that make you question whether we've been transplanted to socal, and I wanted an iced caffeinated beverage. Instead of simply saying we don't serve that drink, I was given an explanation along the lines of...\"Iced coffee is bad for you, you shouldn't drink it. Though alot of people have been asking for it so we may serve it one day but not today.\" I ended up taking an iced tea to-go and feeling really strange about the lecture I got, which frankly made little sense.
