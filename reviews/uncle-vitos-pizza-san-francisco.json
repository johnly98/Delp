On a cold day the door is left wide open, the fans working full speed; I had a table close to the kitchen and still it was so cold, I had to leave my warm jacket on. \n2) This place needs some very thorough cleaning. The glass on the kitchen counter was hardly transparent when looking against the light - you could see all the stains and dirt. The decorations on shelves have thick layer of dust, grease and... cobwebs. The picture on the wall close to the table had lots of old food stains on the glass. I know that cleanness standards are not very high in US but this is beyond average American place.... \nI'm sorry to say that but this place was not cleaned (I mean really cleaned with every single detail and every inch of surface) for decades.", "author": "Magia B."}

I always get my pizza's delivered at work and have never been disappointed.  \n\nI've always enjoyed their Mountain pizza, which is their version of a combination.  It comes with salami, pepperoni, onion, bell peppers, mushrooms and sausage.  I like that they don't skimp on their portions their crust has a nice texture to it and they are very reasonably priced when you compare to other pizza places in SOMA.  I've also enjoyed their pepperoni and have on occasion feasted on their Calzone's.  I don't usually eat pizza crust, but I do with Uncle Vito's pizzas.  \n\nSome of my fellow co-workers prefer a plain cheese pizza, which isn't my cup of tea, but they really enjoy the cheese pizza here.  Whenever we talk about getting pizza delivered, there's always a few who want a cheese pizza.  I want pretty much everything on mine, but everyone has their preferences.  \n\nThey deliver free if you're in the area, which is a bonus.", "author": "Lon H."}

And to be honest, to me, this place wasn't the most exciting pizza place. I have started to become more inclined to eating Neapolitan style of pizzas. I think though, this pizza was just okay.\n\nI got the Mountain Pizza, and honestly it was really nothing special. The taste was like a pizza. There was no special cheese or something extra they did to the dough. It wasn't wood fired. There was nothing special. This was a pizza you would get at any other pizzeria, that was where this pizza was at to me. I mean, it's definitely better pizza compared to any chain though, but it just wasn't anything that special to me. The taste was alright, but honestly it seemed like the owner who served us didn't even seem enthusiastic about his product.\n\nAnd that was what sort of turned me down. He wasn't happy, maybe he was having a bad day, but it seemed like he had no energy or happiness on what he was doing. Seeing all the things on the wall and all the recommendations this place once had, I really don't see it. And, splitting bills is a hard thing on the west coast? When we asked to split our bill we got a sigh and a weird face. Is it not custom? I haven't heard of this before and I'm confused why that's such a big deal...\n\nOverall, it's just okay.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-07-26", "description": "I decided to get a Pizza from Uncle Vito's Pizza while waiting for my laundry to complete across the road. At around 9:30 pm on Sunday it was slammed. Upon entering you will find the ordering station to your right, if front of the open kitchen. There is a small strip of space near the entrance that is used to place orders, pick up pizzas, come in and go out of the restaurant, so when they are full you will literally be standing on top of each other in this narrow space to order. The person taking orders was obviously having a bad day. He was out rightly rude to people who were simply placing orders.\n \nWhen my turn came I decided to get a medium Greek pizza ($16.50) which has feta cheese, salami, pepperoni, bell pepper and black olives. I was a little hesitant to customize, but then I said what the heck we are paying for this, we should be able to choose, so I subbed the pepperoni with sausage. Thankfully there was no drama.\n\nAnyway after ordering, without exaggeration, I waited 30 minutes for my pizza. It was too cold to wait outside so I found a small chair inside. Let's come to the pizza. It is your hand tossed thin crust pizza that was badly made. It seems to be a Neapolitan style pizza, but it lacks the crispy crust and delicate balance of sauce and cheese that keeps the pizza from becoming soggy and mush. This one had way too much sauce and cheese making it a soft soggy mess. It could have used some more time in the oven, but I guess because they were so slammed they seemed to be rushing orders out without proper quality control.\n\nPrice wise they are in line with what you would pay at other pizza joints, but the quality and service is seriously lacking. Delarosa & Pachino both of which are within 10 mins of Vito's manage to do pizza right. Vito's is just super popular. I don't get the draw is so I'll pass.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

Uncle Vito's came up AND it was literally 30 steps from our hotel - SCORE!\n\nHubby and I shared a Cesar salad. Super yummy - not too much dressing, enough to share but just enough to keep you wanting more. I had the pasta special - chicken ravioli with mushroom and sun dried tomato in a cream sauce. Delicious! Lots of flavor, pasta was cooked perfectly, mushrooms were plentiful and chunky (in a good way). Hubby had the calzone. Although it came out piping hot and he had to wait a while for it to cool down enough so he could take decent bites enough to enjoy it, he DID enjoy it (especially after dipping it in my extra sauce)\n\nHighly recommend!", "author": "Kathryn C."}

We were waiting to meet other friends so we decided to get a quick bite to eat. We ordered our food to go. I got a simple personal size pepperoni pizza and my friend got spaghetti. \n\nWe got our food and found out our friends were running late. So we asked to eat our food inside. The waitress with the blonde hair (didn't catch her name) said we could not since we ordered to go we couldn't dine-in. We decided it was okay and we'll eat in their to-go section. But then it became too difficult because my friend ordered spaghetti. -__- So we saw two empty tables and asked the waitress if we could sit there for a bit, she again denied us. \n\nWe decided to just leave because it didn't seem like she didn't want to help us even though we were paying customers (we tipped too). So we asked her for some Parmesan and she said \"All to-go orders have to be helped over there\" and pointed to the cashier area. Then walked away. No one was at the cash register so we had to bug a chef to help us. \n\nI was very disappointed in my service at Uncle Vito's. The waitress was extremely rude to us. We left and ended up eating on a stoop we found and the food was just not enjoyable at all. The pizza was extremely greasy, like those cheap pizzas they gave you in high school cafeterias. And the spaghetti had a very strong taste to it. It was not good. My friend and I could not finish our food and we were HUNGRY. Not a very good experience. Never coming back.", "author": "Meliza M."}

This is your typical Yelp story! By that I mean that if you walked by this pizza joint you might just keep on walking but if you have your trusty Yelp app in hand then you'd see it had a pretty spectacular rating and a shed load of reviews!\n\nBased on what other reviewers said we decided to spend our Friday Night in San Fran munching on pizza at Uncle Vitto's!\n\nWe walked in without a booking and were seated at the window almost immediately. It's definitely a tight squeeze, they've managed to cram about eight tables in to the small space. Expect to be bumping in to the person sat behind you. \n\nThe whole atmosphere is extremely authentic, on one occasion I heard plates smashing from the open plan kitchen and some Italian expletives bellowing out - it sounded like a soundbite, but I loved it!\n\nThe pizza was a work of art, you know when you lift a slice of pizza and it's not too heavy so it doesn't automatically fold but the cheese sticks to the base creating huge, delicious strings desperately clinging on to the remaining slices........you're drooling aren't you?  \n\nStop drooling and get to Uncle Vitto's!

A local can choose from 7,000 places to eat so you had better be doing something special. I had the cheese burger and a soda...it comes with fries. It was fab! Cooked as I asked, fresh-that minute fries, with the tip...$12.50. You gotta be kidding me? Seriously...you can have a great, inexpensive meal and watch the Cable Cars go by...ding, ding, ding...then walk a block to the \"Top 'O The Mark\" and enjoy the best city view available to the public.", "author": "Rodney M."}

We've always been treated well and enjoyed the food, so it's comforting to return for another round of pizza and beer.\n\nI ordered a medium pepperoni pizza, since I was by myself, and a pitcher of Sierra Nevada (only other choice was Heineken).  I was in San Francisco for a one-day finance conference, while the family stayed home back in Orange County.\n\nThe pizza was prepared far sooner than I expected, even though the restaurant was pretty packed.  The pizza was served extremely hot, which was a little rough the first couple of slices, but at least that meant that the last slice I had was still warm and inviting.\n\nThe pizza had a thin layer of sauce, so that the focus was on the ingredients and the crust.\n\nUncle Vito's pizza has a crispy crust and plenty of cheese and pepperonis.  They did not skimp on the ingredients when preparing my meal.\n\nThe restaurant is a small location located along the Powell Street Car line near Union Square.  When you first walk in, the to-go register is right there, along with the pizza ovens and food prep stations.  Straight ahead are a couple of tables and the main dining area is to your left.  When things get really busy, there's another dining area upstairs with 4 tables, or room for about 10-12 people.\n\nThe prices are pretty good for a pizza joint in the middle of San Francisco, near a ton of tourists.  Uncle Vito's also offers many of the traditional Italian dishes you'd expect - like fettuccine, ravioli, and lasagne - as well as some basic burgers and sandwiches.\n\nAlthough it make take a few days for my tongue to recover from how hot the pizza was, I definitely plan on returning for the taste of the pizza.", "author": "Lee H."}

It was very bitter to say the least, so I ended up eating one and picking off the rest. Secondly, the cheese was very off. I am used to cheese on the pizza being a certain way - melty, sizzling and chewy. This was the polar opposite. It was very hard and stiff. I saw someone in a previous review compare it to a cafeteria pizza and I think that is a spot on description (you go Glen Coco!). Lastly, some of the staff was nice but others were just plain weird.

Cheese was a bit unevenly distributed (heavy blobs on parts and none on others) and there was very little sauce (and no zip to the sauce that was there). There were a good scattering of veggies, which I appreciated. Unlike true NY pizza, the crust felt a bit soggy.

We called our order in for pickup and it was ready for us within 20 minutes as promised. They take cards too so we were in and out in no time. We ordered a large \"The Mountain\"(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/uncle-vitos-pizza-san-francisco#Rv-2hOiyJwVqMQu8ZqPSmQ) - a huge meaty pie chocked with with salami, pepperoni, sausage, onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms. The pie isn't out of this world crazy good but it is satisfying and was a good amount of food for three grown men. I wished the crust was crispier but overall, I enjoyed my slices. \n\nIt's a quaint local eatery if you have the time to sit down but otherwise, Uncle Vito's is just a quick call away for decent pizza in the neighborhood.", "author": "Jon L."}

We usually get the Chicken Fettucine Alfredo, Fried Ravioli or Small Mountain Pizza. This place is my 2nd fave to buy pizza from. Im not sure if they make it fresh by order but it sure does taste like it! My fave has to be their Alfredo.. everything is on point! Creamy sauce, juicy mushroom, love how they slightly char the broccoli and chicken bits are flavorful. Fried Ravioli is pretty good too.. crispy on the outside and cheesy in the inside with the tomato sauce on the side mMmm! Gotta eat it fast because crispy-ness dies down over time.

Small, quaint in that Italian/pizza joint kinda way you find in cities like NY and San Francisco. Tight between tables but the kind of place where you don't really mind, or you actually even expect it. I wish we had places like this in Atlanta!!\n\nWe went yesterday as we were exploring the Union Square area after some time in Fisherman's Wharf and H-A, and it was great. Good Caesar salad and a delicious pepperoni, tomato and extra cheese pizza. The medium was more than enough for two. J always lets me pick pizza toppings and we'd never had this particular favorite combo of mine and it was a winner!\n\nBathrooms are at the back. Nice staff. Great location.

I felt somewhat guilty, taking in the taste of my meal as they watched.\nThat being said, the establishment itself is atmospheric, exuding the aura of an Italian pizzeria. I ordered the calzone and the fettuccine with baby clams, all impressively delivered within fifteen minutes. The calzone was scrumptious; a tad soggy, but still good. I wasn't too fond of the fettuccine, but after running it through several of my friends, I found my dislike only stemmed from my personal preferences, as everyone else enjoyed it. The complimentary garlic bread, however, we all agreed didn't have enough flavor to it, but since it was free, I can kind of let it go.\nService was nice, nothing to write home about, but nothing too rage-inducing either. I did eventually need to get the waiters' attention for my bill and to attend to my plates, but we managed to get it worked out. The chefs I could hear were somewhat distressed in the kitchen, though. I hope that's not a regular thing, because their distress can get rather loud and slightly obscene.\nOverall, I enjoyed it. While I'm not sure I'd be willing to wait for a table, I do think the food is good, service is nice, and the building itself is well maintained. Because it's situated sort of halfway up the workout of a hill that is Powell Street, I think it's a good place to stop by if you ever pass by. Worth the climb, in my opinion.", "author": "Guide S."}

We got the feeling that they were understaffed but there were a few staff that were either off shift or just standing around doing nothing. There appeared to be only one server/busser who was obviously overwhelmed, overworked and exhausted. He was plodding along and it was agonizing. \n\nWhy didn't we leave? It was our first night in town. We had traveled all day, our hotel was just down the street and the ratings for what we were looking for was fine. We also aren't quitters and the smell, the smell made us tough it out. We eventually got a seat, got our order in and got our food. There was no service just an order taker and plopping the food down. That's were the 4 star pizza raised the experience to a overall 3 stars. The pizza was excellent we got the simple red pepper, red onions and pepperoni/cheese and it was delicious.

I'm stuck in a hotel in the Financial District for a while, and room service options are limited.  Here's what I expect when I'm at a hotel and order pizza delivery:  1 hour minimum wait, and lukewarm soggy pizza.\n\nHere's what I get from Uncle Vito's, and this is not based on just one-time ordering:\n\nFAST delivery.  That means I don't have to wait long, and my 'za is still warm when it arrives.  Sweet.\n\nCrazy fresh veggies on my super delish Greek salad.  Uncle Vito, do you grow your own tomatoes out back?  So good.\n\nTasty thin crust.  I've only had the pizza pesto, so I can't speak for other pizza/sandwich/pasta options.\n\nTo sum it up, the pizza is good, the salad is unexpectedly awesome, and the service is top notch.\n\n\nHighly recommend.

I was looking for a quick pick me up and a calzone sounded great on my way home. I called in to see how long the pick up time would be for said calzone and the guy was annoyed that I asked first. He told me 15 minutes and I decided to give it a shot. Never had I heard of 15 minute turn over time on a calzone, so of course, I ordered. I went to give the guy my name and he promptly hung up on me before I could give it to him. Okay, I get calzones aren't widely ordered, so I had faith instead of calling back.  \n\nHeaded over to the restaurant about 10 minutes after I ordered, big mistake. First the girl at the counter didn't have my order, eventually she found the ticket, charged me and told me to have a seat since it was in the oven still, and shouldn't be too long. \n\n35 minutes later finally one of the chefs noticed I was still sitting there and asked what I ordered. After some confused looks and finding my calzone that had just been boxed and put on top of the oven with someone else's order, I was finally on my way. But not before being asked for payment once more, which I politely reminded the girl that was taken care of already. Not that I was provided a receipt to prove my claim. But she let me go with no hassle. \n\nFor the amount of time I spent in there on a pick up order, I can say a bunch of the other food they serve looks pretty tasty and smells fantastic.", "author": "Gina C."}

Before we knew it, we'd lost track of time and everyone was hungry, grouchy, sore-footed and tired.  Someone in our hotel had suggested Uncle Vito's, and while we originally thought we'd be more adventurous, by that time Italian food sounded like a good, family pleasing way to go.  I am so glad that we did.  Pasta is a winner nearly every time, and this was really a winner--everyone left happy and stuffed.\n\nI got a pasta dish with artichokes, mushrooms and a light red wine sauce.  It was tongue-blisteringly-hot when it arrived at the table; I'm sure it arrived directly from the tiny kitchen.  No heater lamps in use here!  It was a huge pile of pasta, with a ton of veggies; it was nearly half veggies, which is really generous especially for something like artichokes--usually, I feel like the veggies get used more like garnish on top of a pile of pasta.  This was a really well composed, generous combination of veggies and pasta; the kind of proportions I'd prepare at home.  The wine sauce was light but flavorful.  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal.  The rest of the fam got traditional Itialian dishes, including a huge pile of spaghetti and meatballs--everyone was happy, and as I said, stuffed.  The garlic bread was crispy--I'd prefer it softer, but that's just me.  My wine was -- I believe--$3 for a glass.  Nothing fancy, but perfectly suitable for the meal.  I felt like I was in someone's home--the simple wine and generous food is just what I'd expect.  Looking around at the other diners--several single seaters--it looked liked this is where the locals go to eat a good homey meal.  Prices were good--I don't think any of us had a meal more than $10, which is outstanding nearly anywhere, especially in SF.\n\nMy only negative comments would be pretty peripheral comments.  The place is TINY.  We were there on a Tuesday night and waited for 20 minutes for a tiny cramped table.    That's just what it is, but expect it.   It was clean, but don't go there for the decor or ambiance--the tables were probably 30 years old, finish fading from the frequent washings; the walls simple off white with a hodge podge of art.  My wine was not served in a wine glass but in a sturdy tumbler.  The servers were brisk, efficient and polite; I had to chuckle when the waitress gently nudged me aside to set something on the table.  Again, like eating in someone's home--not rude, just efficient.  If you want delicious, hearty Italian food without any foo-foo trimmings, this is your place.", "author": "Heidi C."}

It took a bit, but this place stepped up and refunded my purchase, which is what I wanted. Thanks!\n\n\n******Begin Original 1-star review********\nSo, this place was recommended by the concierge at my condo in the city, so we took a stroll...First, it was small and VERY tight. It was a busy night, so I expected to be patient. It was also a bit confusing on how things worked, but we figured it out eventually. So, we ordered a small pie to share to go. Took the standard 20-25 minutes for a good pie, and we took it back to our condo. \n\nOpened up the box and dug in...my first impression was \"meh, not bad, but not awesome either\". My companion, however, had an ENTIRELY different reaction:\n\nShe found a long hair baked right into her pizza slice! Yummy! NOT!!!!!!!\n\nOK, so, I was NOT happy, but \"stuff\" happens, right? I figured they were slammed and that I would deal with it in the AM... NOT!\n\nThis is where the ACTUAL 1-star comes from: When I called the next morning, I got put off. I was told that I should have called the night before and that there was nothing they could do now. I paid for a freaking pizza I didn't eat due to a hair baked in!", "author": "Anthony A."}

To me, a born-and-raised New Yorker, a good pizza does not have thick dough. It's not crunchy in the middle or have too many toppings. The cheese should be fresh, not rubbery, and it should not be so thick that you can blindfold yourself with it. The other toppings should also be fresh, not from cans (except maybe olives). A slice should be foldable, lengthwise, the way Jon Stewart demonstrated on his show.\n\nUncle Vito's after 3 orders has not yet disappointed me. It's not the best pizza, but around here it's good enough for me, especially since it's conveniently located.", "author": "Kiai K."}

Our second night was spent roaming around North Beach for great pizza without avail. By Sunday we were looking forward to trying Uncle Vito's mainly due to the convenient location to our hotel. \n\nI have to say there isn't a single reason why you'd need to go anywhere but Uncle Vito's for pizza in San Fran. If you are looking for a fancy dinner out this is not your place. It's small and cozy like most restaurants in San Fran, but quite casual. Our server, Angel, was attentive and nice. The Greek Salad was amazing with tons of fresh veggies, feta cheese, and chick peas mixed in. We ordered a caraf of wine for around $10. Can't beat that! Our pizza choice was half Hawaiin and half Red Eye. Both were deelish! I especially loved the ham on the Hawaiin side.

We decided to order and eat on the street, outside restaurant. Since it was cold, we had requested to have 1 or 2 tables for kids. He REFUSED and won't allow as if \"Indians are not allowed to sit inside restaurant\". So in freezing cold, we waited outside for 1 1/2 hours and ate our food.

But kids were hungry and most of restaurants were full. Never been treated like SECOND/THIRD CLASS citizen. We ask questions, manger(s) were rudely replying to us. We asked for take out boxes. They asked us to re-use same x-large boxes to carry a piece of pizza.We were shocked to receive such discriminatory treatment in USA and that too in San Francisco.

I ordered a small for 3 people, that wasn't such a good decision since it costed $14. There are only 4 slices in a small. So if you're super hungry, I suggest that you shouldn't come here.

The pizza was divine and the spaghetti good, but not spectacular.  (Went back a second time just for pizza!)  Decent, but small, beer selection (wine also).  Saw someone with a salad that looked very good as well.  Service is adequate; albeit not super friendly.  (They seem to be going more for \"efficiency\" than anything else.)  The eating area is small, but I didn't feel it was as cramped as some other reviewers indicated.  (Kind of a typical, smaller Italian venue...)  Highly recommended for dinner OR lunch.

No greeting, no i'll be with you in a second. He took my order and gave me a water. I sat and waited.\n\nAnd waited.\n\nAnd waited some more. Without water refills. Without \"sorry it's taking so long.\" \"Sorry all these people are being served before you.\"\n\nAfter twenty five minutes I couldn't wait any longer. All I had ordered was a veggie burger and fries. I got up, and said I needed the order to go. The cooks are kind of playing around with each other and they stare at me blankly. And then they look to the counter and they say, \"But it's ready!\" I really didn't want to sit and eat, and I was running short on time so I said I needed it to go.\n\nMy waiter half-heartedly apologizes, and they go to ring me up. He swipes my card and says it's decline. I say that's impossible, but I give him another. Declined. I said that, that is really impossible because it's a visa gift card with twenty bucks. His cook friend comes over and says \"Oh! It's out of paper.\" \n\nSo how many cooks does it take to refill the paper? Four apparently. But that will still take them -- and I kid you not-- 10 minutes. In retrospect I should've walked away. I didn't. when they had finally got it, I paid and left. \n\nAnd when I finally got a chance to eat it-- TERRIBLE! Dry, and plain.

Fair enough. The ravioli sounded appealing anyway, with the meat sauce. \n\nIt's really good. Pasta is just al dente, and they got the combination of meat/sauce ratio just right. And I'm normally not a meat sauce order-er. \n\nWe didn't experience slow service at all, but I was trapped into the corner of the restaurant on the bottom floor, so when I needed to get up, my stomach had expanded so much that we literally had to move the table sideways for me to pass. Okay, so there were big guys surrounding the table which made the passage tighter than usual. \n\nBut yes, the little hole-in-the-wall restaurant types score again.", "author": "Trish A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-05", "description": "I'm definitely a fan of Uncle Vito's Pizza and I would return but the reason that I gave four instead of five stars is because from the service to the food, I've had better somewhere else, but that doesn't mean that it still wasn't good. When we arrived to eat it was crowded but we didn't have to wait too long. The garlic bread seems to be frequently talked about in the reviews for this place, plus one of my favorite foods is garlic bread so I had to try it. From what I remember, the portion wasn't to big and the bread was covered in garlic, butter and herbs, but it at the same time wasn't anything special and like I'm going to say about everything, I've had better garlic bread at other places. I got a personal pizza and it was good, nothing that unique but the thickness was good, the cheese was good, and if I was in the area and in the mood for pizza I would get it again. The service was fine, not memorable, from what I remember the entire experience once we sat down was pretty quick.", "author": "Michael G."}

Sadly they do not offer slices, but they do offer personal size pizzas. \n\nThe Red Eye: Pepperoni, red onion, and roasted red peppers. The simplicity of the pizza made for a nice sweet bite because of the red onions and roasted red peppers. Pepperoni help makes you appreciate meat on your pizza. \n\nThe Tia Mia: No pizza sauce. Mushrooms, spinach, and feta cheese. I was intrigued with the no sauce aspect of a pizza, and was surprised on how good it tasted. I think I would have fallen in love with it if it had pesto; a thought if I ever am in the area.\n\nThe wait was horrible, only because I was hungry, and the seating is near the line for those waiting to dine in.

Even if it did take that long, I could always get delivery, but I haven't bothered to yet.  \n\nMy go-to dishes are the personal pizza with pepperoni and garlic, and the spaghetti with garlic and oil (technically it comes with broccoli too but screw that, I want my carbs).  The pizza, while not super thin, has a couple of different types of cheeses and has a good balance of flavors (and, admittedly, not nearly as greasy as Gaspare's). The spaghetti is nearly always al dente with a very healthy dose of garlic, and comes with a large portion of garlic bread on sesame. \n\nI've tried their sausage sandwich and the meatball sandwich as well, both of which are okay - nothing particularly fancy or memorable.  The pesto pasta isn't bad either, though I prefer my pesto less creamy with more pine nuts - that's just me though.   Service is decent, and sometimes you'll get a SF twin sighting in the front window, complete with matching leopard print suits - I'm waiting for the day that I see them and Frank Chu in the same line of sight, at which point I may implode.", "author": "Sus...

I have ordered takeout quite a few times and have never been disappointed with the food. I have had their pizza, quite a few of their pastas, and tried a salad. Their pizza is really good. I like vegetables on my pizza and the vegetables have always been really fresh. I think their pizza is a bit on the pricey side but I blame that on its Nob Hill/down town/touristy location. The pasta is appropriately priced. The portions are pretty big and the taste is great quality. \n\nMy favorite thing to order is their Fettuccine Siena. If you're a pesto person, definitely check this out. Soooo yummy. I recently ordered their Fettuccine with Baby Clams in light red sauce and was really pleased with that too. They weren't skimpy with the clams! \n\nI have never dined there but I can tell you that it is always crowded! It's hard just to get in the door to pick up your food.

But when you see the cooks and waiters racing around that place you understand that they are working as hard as they can. \n\nOne more piece of advice: Order their little side salad! You will be impressed! It's a hearty side salad that can satisfy two people easily and it's only $3.95!!! It has tomatoes, olives, onions, shredded mozzarella cheese and comes with a tasty Italian dressing (and I normally don't like Italian dressing!). If you don't like salad you should still order this.

We were seated right away and even had a window seat which was fun for people-watching.  My boyfriend started off with a locally brewed beer I had a half carafe of house white wine and we split some cheesy garlic bread.  That wine was the best deal of the night.  It's 5.75 for the half carafe and that was about 4 1/2 glasses of wine!  Plus, it was decent wine.  The garlic bread was delicious and also a great deal for how much it was.  We split a medium pizza for the entree.  I thought the pizza was good, not the best I've ever had, but I didn't have anything to complain about it either.

Their wine is decently priced and their service is usually pretty good unless it is super busy in there.\n\nThere are two things that I don't like about this restaurant. The first thing is that it is small. I understand that places in San Francisco are going to be smaller than places outside of the city, but the amount of tables they have in the restaurant compared to the amount of space is ridiculous. You could wait 15-30 minutes for a table and when you get it, you have to press your ass against someone's face in order to sit in the chair they have waiting for you. The second thing is the pizza. If you are eating at the restaurant then feel free to order as much pizza as your heart desires. It will be great. But, if you order pizza for pick up/delivery, when you get it home it is a soggy mess. Our pizza just fell apart when we tried to eat it.

I got takeout and Uncle Vito's made me happy.  \n\nA few blocks away on Powell, in the touristy blocks by Union Square, there's a place that's 1/2 nasty pizza and 1/2 disgusting slop chinese buffet, and they charge too much.  I went there once or twice in a hurry and regretted it.  That's the quality I usually expect around here.\n\nThis time I got solid food with a generous price.  Room for improvement in some ways, but above expectation in others.\n\nBack home in NY, there was only one chain I would order from at work, because they used quality salad ingredients.  Instead of a wooden tomato, stale vinaigrette and wilty iceberg lettuce from a cave... they used fresh romaine, plus garbanzos for flavor, protein and fillingness that crappy salad lacks.  One day they stealthily switched to crap ingredients, and made me go boohoo and never order again. \n\nUncle Vito's advertised a side salad with the eggplant parm and I was suspicious.  \n\nThe cook and counter person were super polite when they handed me a heavier bag then I expected.  When I opened it at work, there was magic surprise garlic bread (standard bread, but yay!)  And it wasn't a side salad- it was a super deluxe, high quality, very fresh salad.  Some iceberg lettuce, but 2/3 romaine.  Shredded mozz.  Plum tomato with flavor, a cut above.  Not-canned kalamata olives. Garbanzo AND kidney beans.  Good, non-stale vinaigrette.  \n\nThe eggplant parm was much larger than expected but with mixed execution.  The worst drawback was being quite underdone.  The cheese topping wasn't crusty/bubbling on the sides and needed a solid 5 minutes more in the oven.  However, the eggplant was prepared very well.  It wasn't soggy inside or out, and the breading wasn't  fried-hard either.  The sauce wasn't as chunky marinara-style as some places use, but decent, except for needing less salt.  It's surely made for many things they serve, and I suspect the salt was overbalanced by the breading in this.  They advertised using part skim mozz with flavor, but not overly greasy, and they were right.  \n\nA solid $10 meal, overall worth a try.", "author": "Pat L."}

Nice touch that the veggies are always fresh (ok, except for canned olives, but what else do you put on pizza?) and the meats are a cut above (no pun intended) what you usually find on a delivery or take-out pizza. Oddly, the pizzas actually get better the larger you order. Usually when I'm getting delivery it's for two or more people, so I get a medium or large. Now and then I've ordered a small just for myself, and for some reason they seem to have a hard time. Maybe \"small pizza\" is simply a contradiction in terms. \n\nThat's the only ding.

So what to do for dinner?  Order pizza from one of the highest rated delivery pizza places by South Beach, that's what.  \n\nBad idea, especially since we were already getting hit with hunger pangs by this time.\n\n7:10 PM: I placed an order for a 16\" large Mountain (salami, pepperoni, onions, bell peppers, mushrooms and sausage).  The pizza man told me I could expect my pizza in 45 minutes.\n\n7:55 PM: No pizza in sight.  We give them the benefit of the doubt and wait another 15 minutes while I rock to Radiohead's \"Creep\" at medium skill level.\n\n8:10 PM: Still no pizza.  I ask the SO to call Uncle Vito's and follow up.  \"The delivery guy just left the restaurant, will be there really soon, \" the pizza man tells him.  In the meantime, my energy level is really low from a lack of food and I'm missing a lot of my notes on Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive.\"\n\n8:25 PM: Is the pizza guy lost?  No phone call, no door bell ring still.  The SO is annoyed and decides to stand outside in the cold to flag down the pizza delivery guy in case he drives by the apartment.  Meanwhile, my vision is getting blurred and I'm slowly entering the red zone during my horrible rendition of Stone Temple Pilots' \"Vasoline\" (what, it's a hard song!).\n\n8:30 PM: No sign of pizza guy.  SO comes back inside annoyed and really really hungry, while I'm desperately trying to save myself from getting booed off stage again (had to retry Vasoline).\n\n8:40 PM: The SO calls Uncle Vito's again.  \"There's a lot of traffic, he'll be there soon.\"  Traffic from Bush/Powell Street to Bryant/Beale??  That's 1.3 miles and even though I'm no expert cab driver, I can make that distance in less than 10 minutes.  I've completely given up on Vasoline and resort to a much much easier Yeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Map\" to end the night on a good note (pun intended).\n\n8:45PM: A very disgruntled SO goes back outside and finds the pizza delivery guy.  Paid him $25 and stormed up the stairs so that we could finally have dinner after waiting 1.5 hours.     \n\nEven though I was ravenous and gobbled the first slice in a few seconds, I was still coherent to realize that the pizza was extremely soggy upon arrival.  After filling my gravely empty tummy with some sustenance, we popped a few slices into the toaster oven.  The toasted pizza was a lot better the second time around.  Toppings were plentiful and the crust was decent, but it wasn't THE best pizza ever.  Not even close.  The cheese wasn't even that stringy!\n\nI'm sure if we ate in at the restaurant, we'd have a much more pleasant experience.  But there's no way I'm ordering delivery from them ever again.", "author": "Diane L."}

Okay, maybe I haven't actually had their pizza.  But whenever I walk past, I stare in because I'm weird like that, and there are always lots of people who appear to be enjoying the pizza pizza pie.  And the pie actually looks pretty damn good.  Not like, east coast good, but SF good.\n\nI have had a couple of the pastas.  Spaghetti and meat sauce was appropriately hearty and comforting.  And the spinach salad really does rock a little bit.  I mean, maybe it's just the dressing, but whatever.\n\nOh, another reason I think that the pizza is probably good is that I had some calzone, and the dough was pretty rocking.  Like, it was a really good balance of things.  It wasn't all bloated and spongey, but nor was it all crackery.  It was, you know, the way it's supposed to be.  The way that some places (North Beach Pizza, I'm looking at you!) just can't seem to understand.  A tip:  if you order  the calzone, maybe don't get the ricotta and sub in something else.  It doesn't add much, and is kind of watery.  But the calzone still rocks my socks.  \n\nYeah.  No real snarkiness here.  Sincerity.

The crust of our pizza was overcooked a bit which left a charcoal taste in your mouth. The pizza is served in a New York style (thinner). The meats and cheeses tasted fresh and good. I was underwhelmed by the sauce. They do serve other items besides pizza, like salads, pastas and cal zones. Make sure you call ahead if you have a group that way you won't end up waiting forever.\n\nThere is better pizza available but this is a good spot to be sure.

They are older women who were wearing leopard print from head to toe and eat here often- always at the same table.\nWe enjoyed Uncle Vitos enough that we decided to go a 2nd night. This time we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. I'm sure this was because the San Francisco marathon was the next morning and everyone was there to carbo load-including us. We were seated upstairs in a tiny dining room and service was slow.

They said it would be about a 15-20 minute wait, and it was just that.  This place is quite small and dark inside and tables are very close together.\nTrying to be as healthy as possible, I ordered a medium size veggie pizza with light cheese, which I shared with my son.  We each had our own Greek salads.  It all tasted good.  My daughter had a pesto fettucini pasta which she said was too rich and creamy for her liking, and she left most of it (had it boxed up and gave it to one of the homeless on the streets).  She ended up sharing our pizza.  Overall, we enjoyed the pizza.  But this was the only place in SF that we ate pizza so I don't have any other restaurant to compare it to.", "author": "Maxie G."}

The hostess sat us at the one available table, a tiny group of sticks in the corner by the window that could barely house my 6'4 friend's 4 foot long legs. Not a good start, but he's used to it. We asked if they could make a 1/2 vegan,1/2 pie fit for a carnivore, and much to our surprise they said yes. Pie and beer ordered, we watched the tourists risk their goofball lives hang off the passing cable cars.\n\nThen we got our first red flag: the beer. Flat Sierra Nevada in glasses that taste like ass is really hard to choke down.\n\nThe pie comes. Looks great, piping hot, bland as shit.

Places like this make me sad when San Francisco has so many amazing places to go instead.  The Nob Hill Cafe is just a few short blocks away...as is Local...as is Za.  So many good places.  \n\nI am not one to typically write reviews, but the ridiculousness of this place made me come right back home and write this.  We walked in at 6:45 pm on a Sunday to find several empty tables.  A man who wouldn't even look us in the eye said \"um, you need to wait like um, like 5 mins or 15 mins for a table,\"  When I asked why we couldn't sit at any of the open tables, he replied with \"those are tables for 4.  you are 2.\"   I spoke with a women who I assume is a manager and she said \"it's the weekend.  we are expecting a lot of people to come in and they may need a bigger table.  you can wait a while for a smaller table\".  So let me get this straight - you are going to make me wait in an empty restaurant for a table to open up so you can save all of the empty tables for people who aren't even there...  I really hope the empty restaurant is a sign that this place will either (a) be out of business soon for terrible operations or (b) lead them to hire people who are reasonable and polite.\n\nThe pizza isn't even good.  It's just convenient.  Which apparently isn't the case any longer.  There are SO many amazing pizza places in San Francisco and sadly, this just isn't one of them.", "author": "Caren W."}

This pizza is ok. It isn't anything like New York pizza, but it is like the pizza you would find in a restaurant where pizza isn't its specialty. What I really love about this place is the ravioli pesto. It is amazing. The best pesto ever! It is creamy and tasty. The one thing I was surprised to see on the menu was fried ravioli. Very \"New York Sicilian\" and it is tasty too.  The food is good and the place is packed every night. I still recommend the pesto.", "author": "Bella T."}

The portion was quite large, I could only eat about 1/3 of it, but found it was mostly cheese & sauce, little noodle in it, and it was a bit on the salty side.  I enjoyed the side salad that accompanied the lasagna..had some beans, cheese and olives which was a bit more interesting than a usual side, and the homemade Italian dressing was quite good. There was also a piece of garlic bread which I wasn't expecting, it was a bit dry so I dipped it in the sauce.

I ordered a small calzone and since I don't eat pork I went with the veggie one with garlic instead of olives. I was pretty disappointed that they couldn't add chicken for a few bucks extra, since a few of their menu items have grilled chicken in them. But other than that, the service was fast and friendly. When I got my calzone it smelled great and looked pretty big for a small, so I was pretty excited. Perhaps this propelled my expectations a little too high, because sadly there just wasn't enough punch to the flavor for my standards. In general, the calzone was very wet and drippy because of the vegetables, so I was beginning to think getting the veggie calzone was a mistake. A few hours later and I can feel myself getting hungry again, probably because I was never fully satisfied to begin with.. But I'm willing to give this place another chance in the future...
