But this place is a joke and shithole that I had  to write my 2 cents!! \nHaving lived at San Francisco for 20 years, we are so used to good lounges/ hotels/ bars in San Francisco with good vibe and cool places that live upto the fun they are and what they advertise ....\nWe had such good time at White chapel before arriving here at around 12:45 am. We stood for a long time before we were even greeted, and then after finally settling down, and  ordering 4 champagne glasses at 1:00 am ... costing us almost 300$ per hour, we were told to leave at 1:20 am when Redwood room advertises it to be open till 2:00 am. The security person , Francis, was very rude when he came to tell us that HE is going to empty out the room BEFORE 2 am today..! Really ?? We asked that it is open till 2 am, and he said it is ... but then he started to argue that it is actually open untill the time HE decides it to be open. Wow!!!!!!! So it's gangsta style.. if HE wants us to have a drink we can , otherwise he is closing before 2 am. And the 300$ we paid were well worth meeting him today or being in the place that is supposed to be cool ( is not thou:). Good job Francis ! but we have dealt with many shit heads like you before. We have dealt with many snooty heads that they think they are worth a million dollar when they ain't worth my penny... I might be calling my lawyer next to draw up racial discrimination lawsuit next ..is how we felt at your place. And your logic that it is open till it's your bedtime is far too idiotic !! . Is it case of complete ignorance of what customer service is versus racial discrimination versus something we can't understand as being one of the successful couple (doctor/CEO's) around or may be you just need a lawsuit to clear up the offense ??! \n\nI called to see who owned this hotel so I could pitch some customer service ideas to the guy who does and who probably had good interest in his mind and wanted to ACTUaLLY treat people well.... and I wasn't given any information. Part of the reason was that Adam, who is operational manager thinks he is the boss when no one is around and he can actually withhold information about the ACTUAL owner of the place with just disconnecting my call. Adam & Francis --- enough of your politics, I have the number I was seeking and turns out the guy who owns is a personal friend to our friend in Tiburon and I will be speaking to higher authorities soon, so betterget your attitude where it needs to be... but as something very personally you did to me and my wife, we will be seeking compensation and suing the place for racial discrimination.", "author": "Neelesh V."}

I haven't gone out for a while so it was nice to dress up and see my friends again. I purchased my first drink on the bar to the right when you walk in. I paid $13 and $2 cash tip. I wrote 0.00 for the tip since I was planning on paying the tip in cash, but I realized it was the customer copy receipt so I put that receipt in my purse. For the bar's copy of the receipt, I wrote \"cash\" on the tip line, and $13 as the total. He took my payment right away when I finished signing the receipt. I honestly don't know if he had anything to do with the mischarge on my card, but he took the payment right away after I finished signing knowing I only purchased one drink and it wasn't busy. I checked my bank account the next day (Saturday) and I was charged $45. I called my bank right away and told them the whole story. Since the transaction was still pending, they said there's a tiny chance it could of been a mistake and to call back when the transaction went through. I checked everyday since Saturday, and on Tuesday the transaction went through but not as $45, this bar somehow charged me $63. It seems suspicious; I'm thinking the bartender Michael changed the amount from $13 to $63 or he may have crossed out \"cash\" and wrote down whatever amount he wanted for his tip. \nI filed a dispute with my bank and they were so kind and patient while listening to my story again. I got my money back from my bank faster than I thought, considering it's around the holidays. So thanks so much to my bank.\n*I won't be coming back to this bar or hotel and I don't recommend this bar or hotel. Look out for a bartender named Michael.", "author": "Kristin H."}

Almost as if it was trying too hard to be cool.\n\nOnce you find your way into the venue from the indeed-swanky Clift Hotel lobby, it does look like a dark, old-school, high-society affair, with richly paneled walls, plus light fixtures that have simultaneously modern and art deco touches to them. The showcase liquor cabinet behind the bar is a natural focal point to the room.\n\nThat having been said, other fixtures like \"paintings\" on the walls whose eyes follow you around the room and blink at you were positively super-creepy. It's like you're being perved over by convicted sex offenders who are looking at you behind jail cell windows. That having been said, the whole venue seemed to have its fair share of desperate hotel guests looking to get lucky for the night.\n\nMost importantly, the cocktail program, while ambitious, just didn't sing in terms of booziness or value, whether it was the pineapple express or the blackberry smoosh, despite the fact that the bartenders were engaging and friendly. Worse yet, a helping of peanut butter banana cake was utterly stale. \n\nThis place might be super-hopping when there's a special event, but on a normal night of the week, I found a lot to be desired.

During day and evening hours it's a respectable spot to grab a cocktail, chat up a bartender and lounge in some comfy furniture. However, during late nights and last calls it's a meat market and a drunken gathering point filled with drunken stragglers who spill out into the lobby and the street in a clumsy mating ritual. Pick your poison and plan accordingly. \n\nThe cocktails are pretty satisfying, but I think the spacious room and layout is the best part about this place. It makes for good happy hours, company gatherings or just sitting with a friend. The fact that it is in an already nice looking boutique hotel only helps with that ambiance. \n\nI've stayed at the Clift a couple times now on the higher floors and noise from below has never been an issue. The fact that the bar is tucked back into the building helps conceal that.", "author": "Alex L."}

Just came here Thursday with my bestie and now I know why my boss continuously raves about this place and he is the pickiest person ever. \n\nGot here around 9:30 and it was poppin. Busy to the point where you have to scout for seats at the bar. You can make reservations for the sofas as well with a minimum easily reached. This bar is gorgeous and super swanky. Every corner is a new photo op and I'm sure I looked dumb af taking a million selfies here. \n\nWhoever runs this place NEEDS to give Ivan a raise. This guy is SHARP. He is the best bartender I've ever had and I am a drunk so I know my bartenders. I'm literally writing this review sitting at the hotel bar in the Four Seasons Biltmore wishing I was at the Redwood Room instead just so I can see Ivan again. Some guy was trying to get me to buy drinks on my tab and I told Ivan to make sure to hand the guy the bill and he didn't miss a mothafucking beat. He just nodded and looked straight at him and was all \"so you want to start a tab?\" amazing. This is what dreams are made of. \n\nI started with the Clift Painkiller with half the coconut cream so I didn't up drinking 5000 calories by the end of the night. I ended up ordering it again four hours later (I ended up staying till close) and Ivan remembered exactly how I liked it. Super impressive considering how busy this place was and how he had probably made hundreds of drinks in the mean time. He is super attentive aind so quick. My friend and I ordered a stupid amount of drinks and it was never difficult to get his attention. Nothing worse than having to wait 20 minutes to order at a busy bar. \n\nAlong with the cocktails galore, we also got a hamburger which was MASSIVE and four espressos. I also asked Ivan to make me a strong vodka drink that didn't taste like vodka and he hooked it up considering it tasted like juice and I was proper wasted by the time I left. Just how I like to spend my thirsty Thursday's. \n\nThe only thing that might throw people off is the sausage fest here. I've never seen so many dudes on the prowl. I'm pretty sure everyone thought my friend and I were escorts purely based on the fact we were the only single ladies there. Lots of cheesy dudes hitting on us to the point where my friend hid under a chair to hide from one!! There is no way this is escort central because there were no other single girls there. Just tons of dudes probably looking for escorts. Some guy literally followed me to the bathroom and yelled at me to talk to him as soon as I got there.\n\nOtherwise I don't know why there are so many negative reviews. Drinks are pricey but it's also SF. I've paid more for drinks that had dead flies in them (ahem ahem Fleur de lys). Trust me this place could charge even more and people would still swarm for the solid drinks and ambiance.", "author": "Tiffany V."}

Not to mention, we also paid for a room at the hotel as I was trying to make it a special night for my husband. An overly expensive and horrible experience.

How freaky!\n\nIn terms of drinks, I started out with the sangria, which was way too sweet. Later I got the Guava Margarita which was okay. Not what I was expecting. I would not order that cocktail again, but I was jealous of my friend who ordered the Pineapple Express.

It feels enormous with the vaulted ceilings and the brightly back-lit shelving unit of various libations (photo: http://bit.ly/YAlHqB).

The presentation was so elegant with the folded napkins, etc. \n\nI had a small hiccup at the venue. I couldn't get connected to their open wifi in the back of the Redwood Room, the area reserved for my group. I needed the wifi to do online check-in.

The Redwood Room is a cross between a night club and a nice wine bar. Everyone is well dressed, music is super loud and a bottle service is available. However, there's no dancing and you're able to sit at he bar even at the peak of the night. It's more of a sit down and have drinks place, though the place can be super crowded and not enough places to seat.  If you find yourself getting a bottle service, my experience is been just the worst. Once the bottle arrives is very likely you won't ever see your waitress, gratuity is included on all bottle services. So whether you like her service or not she gets a tip. \n\nTo enjoy the bar: I recommend going with a small group, getting there around 9:45PM and 10:00PM , grab a seat towards the back and by the bar. You'll still have a great view and the bartender is able to serve you faster.  This is the place you stop by and pre-party before heading to your last stop. \n\nI wouldn't recommend this place for groups without bottle service and you've been warned by everyone here about the lack of service. \n\nThe crowd for the most part is very well dressed, very hot women and this is not your 20-something bar crowd.

There's moving portraits on the walls that can be kind of creepy, but I guess it works. On a Thursday night they even had a DJ spinning, but no one was dancing. There are tables around for table service though.\n\nAfter grabbing our drinks we decided to enjoy them in the lobby of the hotel, where there's plush couches and more light to better see your company.", "author": "Leana L."}

I never had to wait to get in which I'm sure plays into that. My coworkers and I got a table every night we were there. Never had to pay a minimum or table service. This lounge gets very very packed so I'm super happy we were able to get a table every night. I think the key is to put your name down early to reserve it. We put our names down at 6-7pm, went to dinner, came back around 9-10, and our table was ready.\n\nI got Jameson neat for every drink. It's under poured which is my pet peeve. If I'm paying $12 a drink, then pour me something worthwhile. I finished my drinks in three sips every time.\n\nAll in all, it's a lounge with a huge crowd and loud dance music.", "author": "Qui C."}

They're made by a nice Asian lady (the night I went) who smiles and pours liquid from different bottles (that she probably doesn't know anything about other than the name) in a glass. It's pretty much some Asian auntie who is \"throwing something together\" when people come over. It's not a sophisticated liquor-educated person in a suit/bow tie sharing with you their thoughts about libations who is using some special bartending technique they've perfected. The Asian lady will ask questions like, \"do you like something sweeter or less sweet?\" then make some random suggestion that has some fruity mixer and serve it to you as if she is the greatest mixologist. She is thinking about how much of a sucker you are spending that much on one drink. Somewhere a $16 cocktail is worthwhile, a bartender will ask questions such as, does your palette enjoy smoky, bitter, fruit flavors?\n\nI mean, it's mostly foreigners walking around this bar probably on a all-expenses-paid business trip, so whatever. With that said, this is not the place you want to go for cocktails unless you're in your 40's/50's and have money to blow without children to take care of.

When we told them the size of our group, the waitress responded with a heavy sigh, rolled her eyes (maybe they don't typically get groups that large?) and told us there was a table available for an hour but we'd have to leave after. Fine, whatever. We happily accepted the offer and were seated. \n\nThe waitress arrived and collected all of our IDs. She returns them all, except mine, and walks away without saying a word. Now, I'm used to people being suspicious of my ID. I'm 24 years old, but I still look like I'm 15. However, I've done my fair share of going out and this has never happened. So I continue to sit there and have a good time. She's gone for about 10 minutes (how long does it take to verify an ID?). Meanwhile, I'm a little uncomfortable with the fact that she took off with my ID card without telling me what she was doing. That is my property with my personal information, and I don't know what she's doing with it. So when she comes back, I'm expecting some sort of small explanation. However, she walks back, hands the card to me, and turns to leave. I asked her what she was doing with my ID, and she responds saying my ID's \"donor\" circle is an actual part of my card rather than a sticker, and all of my friends have stickers, so she had to verify it. Ok, that's fine. I said don't have a problem with you needing to verify it, I just wish you told me at some point what was going on, as it would have made me feel more comfortable. Now, most people would expect some sort of small apology here (customer service 101). Instead, she gives me a long, condescending answer that it's their policy to check suspicious IDs. Throughout her answer, she includes at least 3 \"my dears\" and a few \"sweeties\". I don't appreciate being talked down to by someone who is probably my age or younger just because I look young. It's rude, discriminative and insulting. If I ask a question about your bar's policy, I do not appreciate an \"Aww my dear, this is just how things work in grown up land\" response, which is a summary of the answer she gave me. Throughout our one hour of being there, I was the lucky one out of my friends to always receive a \"sweetie\" or \"my dear\" from this waitress. Just because someone may not look their age, does not mean you have a right to speak to them like a child. \n\nI respect any company's policy of verifying IDs. All I asked was that she be more informative to customers in the future about the process. People don't like being left in the dark, especially when it involves their property. \n\nNeither my friends nor me will be attending this bar in the future. We ended up leaving after finishing our drinks and having a great rest of our night at another bar where the waiters and bouncers were respectful and friendly. \n\nIf you're willing to compromise customer service for a pretty setting, then by all means try this place out.

Don't get me wrong, the cocktail I had was good but not astounding. Further, a couple of friends in our group did get cocktails that ended up being almost undrinkable and the bartenders were not as accommodating as they could have been to fix the drinks. \n\nThe cashiers/hostesses (not sure what to call them since they weren't making drinks nor did they greet us when we entered) were simply awful. They had bad attitudes AND were borderline incompetent. They made paying for our group a nightmare. As is usually the case we were asked to keep a card for the tab. \n\nWe asked if we could just pay separately at the end instead of putting down 5 cards and were told it would not be a problem. We had made it clear that the card was intended to be used for the few friends who ordered drinks together but the staff ended up holding it for the 20+ people who were there for the same birthday. When we tried to pay for our drinks separately, we were told we would only be able to do so if we paid with cash. Let me make it clear that I do not expect that I have to pay with cash in a swanky place. After an aggravating 20 mins we were finally able to cut our losses by getting them to just put the 5 drinks we initially ordered on the one card we original put down for the tab.", "author": "Tasmin S."}

Its not packed enough, we should let some more people in.\" \n\nSo the Clift hotel is pretty posh. The decor is super chic with a  classy modern vibe. All this translates in the Redwood room. \n\nThe Redwood Room is the hotel bar/lounge, outside the dining room. It has a reasonable amount of comfy chairs and couches for enjoying  cocktails on. Its dubbed the Redwood Room because, you guessed it, its a room lined in redwood. There's a  large wall shelved from ceiling to floor behind the bar that houses many exotic liquors. Various ghost paintings that gradually move and blink over time also accompany the decor, which I thought was pretty cool. Very Hogwarts esque. It's really just display monitors. \n\nThe actual size of the room is quite large. The problem is its fairly narrow, with couches arranged in nonstrategic areas. This does not pose a problem until hundreds of people are ushered in. Thankfully after 20 minutes of waiting for a drink, $8 bottled beer by the way, you can head out into the lobby for some air. If at all possible, avoid going on a weekend night. \n\nSo why only one star? \n\nI can understand going to a popular lounge on a Saturday night with no cover in such a fine establishment would attract a large crowd. My problem was mainly with the Clift doorman on the Geary side hotel entrance. Since I had never been to the Redwood Room and the address was the same as the Hotel, I assumed you entered from the front of the building. When we approached the doorman he was unhelpful, and did not direct us promptly to the Taylor St. entrance for the Redwood Room. Instead, he proceeded to tell us lies about how the line for the Redwood Room was extremely long and that it would take 30 minutes of waiting to be let in, but since it was only the two of us, he would let us in the main entrance if we \"took care of him.\" I replied, \"no thanks\"  I would rather check out the \"line\". As I suspected, there was no line, and we went right up to the bouncer where we were quickly led in. \n\nI'm a bit surprised that such a fine hotel would have such an undignified doorman. But I suppose Greed begets Greed as I've heard the prices here are outlandish.", "author": "Andrew D."}

And by \"magical,\" I don't mean mystical or enchanting - I mean magical, as in illusional. Like a rabbit appearing out of a top hat that wasn't there moments ago or a skimpily dressed woman being sawed in half and miraculously put back together in one bloodless piece. \n\nMaybe it's the shadowy, sensuous mood lighting. Or the deeply masculine Redwood paneling that makes you feel like you're lounging in the exclusive, invite-only library den of a monied playboy. Possibly, it's the sexually-infused imbibements, ladden with exotic ingredients and heavy parts alcohol.\n\nNah. I'm pretty sure it's the 5:1 ratio of men to women - with the majority of those XY's being prominent, international business men; investment bankers from Tokyo, sheiks from the United Emirates, shipping moguls from Greece -all with the same carnal thirst for the ephemerally fleeting essence of a San Franciscan female. Is this what a wounded antelope feels like happening upon a pride of ravenous lions? Quiiiiite possibly.\n\nWhatever the reason(s), the magic of the Redwood Room somehow manages to transform homely women into attractive ones, attractive women into beautiful ones, and beautiful women into unattainable supermodels. It should be renamed \"The Upgrade Room.\" As an XX, you'll never know the price of those 4 stiff martinis your slid down your throat, because men are practically fencing each other to buy you a drink, vying to be more to you than just another business card in the girl's bathroom trash can. If you are an aspiring gold-digger, bring your shovel here. Exactly how many indecent proposals have those creepy wall painting eyes been witness to? \n\nAs you and your pantheon exit the Room, (because you can only stand feeling like prey for so long) pageant waving good-bye to your adoring male fans, walking in slow motion towards the hotel exit (where did that wind come from?

The place was packed and the crowd was pretty diverse (in age) - people ranging from mid 20s to mid 60s (I kid you not) but not so much gender diversity with about an 8:1 male to female ratio. I thought the music here was pretty random - but given the vast age difference in their patrons I suppose they tried to play something for everyone.\n\nThere's no line, no cover, and no dress code (though people seemed to be on the dressier side here). There are a bunch of tables but reservations are needed. The drinks here are pretty expensive - I'm only willing to pay $15 in Vegas, thank you. Plus, if I'm paying $15 for a drink it better be really good and really strong, sadly, neither were the case here. \n\nBottom line, I'm not jumping at the chance to return to the Redwood Room as there are plenty of better options in Union Square.", "author": "H T."}

Some nights it's flooded with self-important suits that are 15 years too old to be hanging out in bars.  Other nights you bum into a kindred spirit who can actually carry on a conversation.\n\nThe seats are ALWAYS \"reserved\".  The bar itself a complete zoo.  The lounge area is in fact more appealing, with a fireplace and cushiony love seats.  The waitress would even take your drink orders there - no need to brave the mad crowd.", "author": "Kristen S."}

It's ultra modern, very dark, very sultry, very high end, and well... a cesspool of creeps, tourists, out of towners, business men and yuppies. All stuff that has been said before. In my imagination, the Redwood Room would be the perfect meeting ground for Goths, Morticia Adams, guys in smoking jackets, females in bunny costumes (cute bunny ears and tails... not a full on furry costume no thank you), evening gowns and tuxes, and random strangeness of Alice in Wonderland, Emily the Strange, and Harry Potter all mixed up. The place is sort of a fantasy world except the real life clientele is all all wrong!\n\nI absolutely love the decor, concept, and eclectic pieces of giant chairs and House of Horror art on the wall at the Redwood Room/Clift Hotel. Even going to the bathroom is a feast for the senses (in terms of interior design but if neon lights turn you on then by all means indulge!). The drinks are standard bar drinks with city prices. Nothing special. I take people to the Redwood Room just to see the place. Everything else is not my style. \n\nGet in and get out after a round. Anything else is going to feel like overkill and the people will start to get to you. After being harassed by some dudes, the bouncer at the Clift escorted us to our car. For that, the Redwood Room could not get less than three stars. If not for such safety provided by the Clift, the awkwardness of the crowd could easily make this bar one star par.", "author": "Rachel A."}

From the deep recessed couches and quirky South-Beach-Art-Deco imitation/imagination of masculinity, the scene is set for some of the most amusing private moments of public humiliation.  \n\nThis place is expensive.  It reeks of San Francisco during the opulent era before Madoff, 9/11, bailouts and foreclosures.  That also means, it was the era of fantastical, nonsensical, Alice-Wonderland distortion and ridiculousness.  There is a couch in the lobby constructed entirely of longhorn horns.  \n\nThe crowing glory is the gigantic Alice-in-Wonderland chair in the middle of the lobby.  It's a giant chair.  A giant dinner-table-like chair.  Not a velvet armchair, or something plush.  Just a big chair.  Grown women squeal at the delight of being a little girl again.  Grown women in really short sparkly dresses and precarious landscape.  Marvel at the sight of these women getting on to the chair, posing for a photo, and then getting off the chair.  There is no graceful way to do it.  No stairs, no fire escape, no handrail.  The best way is to attack it like monkey bars, swinging a leg up to catch the heel on the seat, and then hoisting the upper body up and over the edge.  \n\nGetting down is equally persnickity.  It's way too high to jump and land on stiletto-shod dainty paws.  It's too high to jump with trainers (tennis shoes).  The technique is to hang on to one of the arms, shimmy and slide while the legs are tangled to prevent free fall, then hope that one's dignity survived gravity.  \n\nThat being said, it didn't strike me as the place to meet people.  The crowd in the bar proper was very intent on being exclusive.", "author": "Christina C."}

Last Saturday I brought a friend visiting from out east to start the evening at the Redwood Room. \n\nHer eyes lit up upon walking into the room.  She complimented everything from the modern 1920s decor to the digital paintings on the wall.  My girlfriend and two other friends that had joined us were equally pleased with the layout.  \n\nIt seems the Redwood Room draws in San Francisco socialites in the age range of late 20 to 50 somethings.  It is a posh crowd.  Glancing around the room I could make out a few true professionals and obvious \"posers\".  The bar was packed so it would occasionally be a pain to order a drink.  A lot of the guests were polite to me but I think my girlfriend had to occasionally move aside while socializing to allow some  \"gold diggers\" part through the crowd.  \n\nThe DJ that evening was throwing down a lot of dance music but there really isn't any space to dance, although the mixes were uplifting.  The venue came off as more of a social lounge.  There is another room with plenty of seating where you can socialize in a more quiet setting .  The staff was also very professional and kind.  \n\nFor the most part if you plan on coming to the Redwood Room arrive early before the midnight crowd builds up around the bar.

When we first arrived around 8:00, it was all business meetings and middle-aged business travelers getting progressively drunker, lots of 40s-and-up men looking for some Lost in Translation action during their pharmaceutical sales conference or whatever.  The bar itself didn't strike me as extremely swanky despite the dramatic entrance from the Philippe Starck-designed hotel lobby (fabulous giant chair).  They have rather tasteful giant flatscreen panels on the walls that transition between color-matching Gustav Klimt paintings, which was a nice foil to the lovely Art Deco wood interior.\n\nThe bar opens up onto the hotel restaurant dining room, which was either strangely empty or just for special events.  Lots of little seating areas for quiet conversations before the room gets too loud, two fireplaces and very interesting light fixtures made me feel like I was in an expansive library of an old wood-paneled mansion of an aesthete art collector.  The bartender was highly amenable to my friend's strange drink requests until we drank them out of Mandarine Napoleon or whatever she was getting.\n\nAfter 11:00, the crowd really picked up and the place started popping, the dance floor opened up and suddenly we were surrounded by crazy drunk Real Housewives-type golddigger women in the late 30s dressed in fur vests.  Weird, but fun.  The faux corporate investment banker menfolk started chatting us up, I left at midnight with two numbers of men I'd met--a first!!  What!\n\nMinus points for the bathroom being so far away, WITH OBSTACLES, that made it nearly impossible for wasted people to stumble to it in their stupors (I don't know anything about that firsthand).  The bathroom itself is confusing as hell, and there are strange hallways down in the entrance to the Redwood Room that really LOOK LIKE they should be bathrooms, so deceptive!

They make you wait outside and let in one group or party at a time (in 15 min increments) . \n\nMind you - it was already 12:30am. I didn't see the point but we got in after 15-20 minutes...but maybe that was because we were starvin like marvin and when they heard we wanted to order food also  - they gave us a table and let us in asap.  (We were told they have a limited bar menu due to the time )\n\nWe got the only things that we possibly could get at that hour. \n\nFood\nCalamari - the plate was huge but the taste was not \nIt was chewy and had a lot of batter and was served with KETCHUP in the middle. ummm ok? ketchup with calamari at a hotel? wha?!?! \nIt also lacked flavor - but we didn't care - we were famished. \n\nBleu Cheese Burger with Fries (you can pick any cheese you want - so I asked for Gorgonzola - which they said - ok anything but gorgonzola - go figure) The buns for the bread were huge but very dry so we mostly just ate the hamburger patty with cheese. I asked for it to be cooked medium and this place actually cooked it medium and not well - which is usually what happens when I ask for my burger to be cooked to medium. Anyways, then we had...\n\nSome spring roll - which I didn't get the name of because our friend Gene ordered it - but it came with fresh black beans and chopped mango. I think the shredded meat was chicken or pork but I couldn't tell - either way - the shredded meat was SO DRY that I couldn't even finish one roll. Can you believe that? The skin of the roll was light and crispy though. \n\nOkay so as far as the food goes - don't come here for food. \n\nAs far as drinks - we got\nLychee Martini (my new favorite & the only martini I actually like)\nMerlot (this is what I drank)\nIrish Coffee (for the DD)\nHeineken \n\nThe interior of the hotel did remind me of LA's Edison (bar/lounge in downtown) - trendy & swanky - they had couches with candles lit on coffee tables in the lobby area  and along the way to the restroom (which is VERY BRIGHTLY LIT compared to the dimly candle lit lobby and bar). In the middle of the lobby - there have a gas fire going behind the huge giant chair. \n\nAs far as the bar - Steve told me to look up at the portraits or pictures on the wall - they were digital I think? and the portraits actually blinked their eyes or looked to the left and right. It was really cool. Later on, in the night, it changed to some stonehenge pix. \n\nThe service was attentive but again - that could be because we were the only ones eating at that hour. \n\nThis place is a good place for a date and more for tourists than locals it seems. Not a place to come for singles to mingle or friends, but that's just my opinion. \n\nAlso, the only reason I gave this place a 4 is that it was the best nightlife spot we went to on our SF weekend trip. (Note: I have been spoiled by LA's bars & clubs - which I thought I was becoming de-sensitized to until I came to SF and visited the other nightlife spots which pale in comparison. It quickly reminded me that cities outside LA are more urban, old, charming in their own quirky right, and definitely more historic.) \n\nAlso a plus is that they did play actual club music at this bar/lounge at a decent volume. (Usually most bars/lounges especially hotel ones at that - you'd expect to hear jazz or downtempo house as light background music)\n\nPosted Photos", "author": "Enjella L."}

While the upscale snooty crowd isn't really my bag, I really enjoyed the bar.  The room is absolutely gorgeous - the walls all made of redwood - and the bar itself is quite unusual.  In a way it reminds me of a vintage etched, glass jewelry box.  I've been to many a bar and I've never seen a stand-alone bar of this design type.  Great fun is the artwork in the bar.  Each giant frame displays what appears to be a portrait of a man or woman, but you realize after focusing on one for more than 5 seconds, that the person is moving, just barely.  Very cool...creepy cool.  The spot really mixes well the Ian Schrager modern, minimalist style with the feel of an old, dark cigar lounge.  \n\nService:  very attentive and friendly, despite how crazy busy the place was.  We were actually quite impressed with this.\n\nPrice:  whoa!  high end, for sure\n\nFood:  four of us ordered a sampling of snacks for dinner.  Some dishes were unusual and quite tasty (i.e. the rock shrimp), some were surprisingly average (i.e. sliders), and some were WOW (i.e. the flatbread - a mix of prosciutto, shaved cheese, sausage, greens, etc.).  I can't speak to the drinks because we all ordered the well, cocktail variety and beer.\n\nOverall, I'd guess that the best time to come to this place is on a Thursday night, when I'd imagine it would be a little less busy than a weekend but busy enough to be lively.  If they have a happy hour, that might help with the cost.  While the food and service were pretty good, the draw of this place is really the beauty of all that redwood paneling and the overall stylings of the bar.  Get a corner booth/table if you can so you can watch the room, and avoid the bar's standing traffic.", "author": "Julie P."}

It loses it's 5th star because I enjoy it so much it could potentially bankrupt me if I went there any more often! Along with being the best cocktails in the city they are also the most expensive for being the most creative, potent and delicious.\n\nIf you get there early enough you can secure one of their signature plush red couches with the perfect view to peruse the eclectic crowd of travelers and locals, young and old . . . until the VIP reservations outrank you anytime between 9:30-11PM (but sometimes never) depending on the day and time of year. When it's less crowded you get better service and can enjoy the live, framed artwork on the walls - look for their ever changing faces to tell their story.\n\nYou can enjoy amazing Asia de Cuba food late night but prepare yourself for the like-minded prices. A word on tipping your waitress - you are not at a dive bar or even a typical bar, so it's not acceptable to tip her 1$ a drink! These girls work extremely hard with a positive attitude, in very short dresses to serve large areas of demanding customers. Your tip should be AT LEAST 20% if not more.

I looked at my account online and saw a $100 charge from The Clift Hotel.  I only spent $50-60, so I called to see what was up, and as it turns out, they do a $100 run on your card.  This typically would not be a big deal, but it resulted in an overdraft fee because I spent the money I thought I had elsewhere.  \n\nI was not informed of this policy by our waitress (who was cute as a button and great otherwise) and explained my dismay when I called the hotel.  Note that it took a few days for the account to be credited.  I politely suggested that staff explain the $100 policy to patrons.  The response?  Not \"sorry about that,\" or \"we'll be sure to do that.\"  No, instead, I got a \"very well.\"  \n\nCustomer service, people, really, it's good for karma, and when you work in the service industry, it's your job.  Suck it up and be sweet as honey, or find another job where it's ok to be a jack ass.  So many people in the Bay Area seem to be oblivious to this concept.

We came mid week, dressed nicely, and although the place was not busy at all, we were treated like dirt.\n\nThe main reason for one star is the terrible customer service and attitude we received all night. Here are some examples: \n\nOnce we got the attention of our servers (we had two, both horrible throughout the night) , she really didn't want to explain anything about the menu or the drinks. \n\nWe asked for the amazing blue cheese stuffed olives they usually have in their martinis (as listed on the menu), and received plain olives without any explanation.\n\nI asked her at one point during the night to help me explain the story of the moving paintings, and to my surprise, she very rudely and curtly said something like: \"it's about some guys and girls ... and you can really just make up your own story, it doesn't really matter, you know that, right?\" and walked away!!!\n\nAnd on top of it all, not once did they say a \"happy birthday\" when my friends stated that we came her for my birthday, let alone a candle or a complimentary drink, shot, or smile (not that I expected anything at all, but this is the only establishment that I've been in where on numerous occasions, someone refused to smile or say happy birthday to a customer celebrating a birthday). It was a bit bizarre.\n\nThese points might sound small one by one, but the whole experience throughout the night just added up to a bizzare and very rude encounter towards us.

Packed, as in I could feel the sheer heat emanating from the number of bodies in the room.  All the tables were full, and there were a large number of people in front of the bar.\n\nThe crowd was definitely older -mid to late 30's.  People were dressed to impress, and cougars were a plenty.  There were definitely some extremely good looking women, and for every one of them there were at least 2 - 3 average looking men in attendance.  I can't say for sure that there were any working girls there, but it wouldn't surprise me.\n\nDespite the crowd, I managed to get the attention of the bartender relatively fast.  I ordered a double whiskey (top shelf) and double tequila (also top shelf).  The damage?  $60 + tip for 4 shots of alcohol.  Damn, but I expected that.\n\nLater on that evening I ordered a Pisco Sour (made to the best of their ability) and bailey's on the rocks, and the cost was significantly lesss ($24 + tip).\n\nThe bar lives up to it's name in decor.  The room is (apparantly) constructed of huge redwood walls with an impressive bar display.  If you are fortunate enough to find a table, the chairs are comfortable enough.  We managed to secure some  chairs in the adjacent lounge, and it was quiet enough to talk there.\n\nOverall, the price was a bit too high for what they had to offer, but it wasn't really my scene either.

Entering the front of the building, I noticed automobiles parked out front that are worth more than some people's townhouses. As i stepped inside the lobby, i felt like i'd stepped into a movie set, a movie about over consumption, trophy girlfriends/wives and the effects of cocaine on the inherently obnoxious.\n\nThis doesn't mean the bar is without its merits however - the decor is plush, and the staff are very professional and make you feel like a valued customer as opposed to a nuisance like some other establishments i've been to. I was there with a cousin, and three of her more attractive friends, and despite the ample cleavage, legs and shoulders on display, everyone there was really polite, and not a single rude comment or creepy remark mas made to these young ladies. The crowd that night was - albeit somewhat flashy - fairly approachable and friendly. Drinks are a bit pricey however, averaging around $15 - i left my tab open for the group, and tasted vomit after being handed the bill at the end of the night.\n\nWith that said, I'll definitely go back, especially when i need to impress a date, an out of town guest or show off my Ukrainian escort for the night. I'll also make sure i valet my car so as to avoid the labyrinth of crackheads on my way to the parking lot in the Tenderloin....", "author": "Dennis A."}

I feel as if I've taken the red pill and dropped down a rabbit hole into a disproportionately beautiful world, chock full of sensuality and darkness, mirrored by a lush opulence that just beckons to me. Oversized chairs, indirect lighting, a fireplace that's stretched to the ceiling so reminiscent of Hans Solo's freeze in Star Wars, and this is just the entrance through the Clift into the Redwood Room. I remember the controversy about removing the original wood in the bar when Ian Schrager purchased the hotel and was renovating it. Regardless, the Redwood Room is beautiful. It is eerily dark, with light reflecting off of the mirrored bar and lighted floor to ceiling cabinet holding the wide selection of alcoholic choices that looms behind the bar. \n\nI don't know how to be polite about it, so I won't be. The bar, although it boasts the best Lychee martinis ever (they better be at fifteen bucks a pop, and I need several), and the ambiance is incredible, is always full of poser nouveau riche euro-trash. I really just can't think of another way to say it. Rude rich snobs bumping into my elbow spilling my precious exlixir. Men dressed in expensive suits with no taste or class. Over stuffed silicone breasts so hard I could bouce my lychee right off them and maybe make the shot into the garbage can, or the mouth of an innocent bystander. Sometimes these people ruin my experience at one of my favorite places to go, but because I so admire the decor, love my beverages, and refuse to be run out of \"my\" haunt in my city, I return, time after time. I'm a sado-masochist, a glutton for punishment. \n\nBut the creamy deliciousness of my martini so outweighs the elitists surrounding me. And I get lost in the roving eyes of the digital pictures on the wall. As long as I keep to my space and am not bothered, I fall into a dreamlike state there, in the dark, with the light hitting my face usually just the right way from the glowing tables, just so you can see the glint of my eyes and the smile across my face in the dark.

We stayed there last night for NYE.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the NYE party wasn't as great...unless you like parties that are dominated by desperate women looking for dates (I prefer to reserve the single hot guys for myself).  It was a little sad.  There were 3 rooms, each with a cool tropical Cuban theme and each with a different cash bar (a mojito table, a champagne table...).  In what is normally the lobby area, the DJ was pretty decent and the crowd was OK.  Upstairs in the Mezz level, the DJ was TERRIBLE.  The music he was spinning was alright, but I'm not sure he's ever used a turntable before last night.  Oh, and of course, there were more desperate women.  \r\n\r\nShortly after midnight, my friend and I retreated to Ruby Skye - where the music was fantastic, even if the clientele was a little obnoxious (someone tell the technical recruiter from San Mateo what, \"I'd rather dance by myself\" means).\r\n\r\nFast forward to brunch this morning at Asia de Cuba.  My friend was expecting a large buffet selection.  She commented that she generally expects restaurants to serve items she couldn't cook herself at home since she doesn't consider herself a capable cook...we were both sure she could have easily thrown together the scrambled eggs and bacon they were serving.  The croissants tasted like they were left over from Christmas.\r\n\r\nHowever, the grace that saved the Redwood Room/Clift Hotel/NYE experience for me was the EXCELLENT service.  The people who work there have unending patience with overwhelming crowds, seemingly demanding guests and a brutal NYE schedule (full hotel, party all night long, and brunch in the morning).  Seeing the same people manage all of that was very impressive.  Three cheers for great staff - and some VERY cute bellmen, too!", "author": "Tanya S."}

They lost the franchise and things spun downhill from there.  Then, in one of those vast serendipitous mistakes of judgment, Ian Schrager decided at the height of the dot com boom that our city was ready for expensive trendy style, pouring his investors's fortunes into rescuing the place from sure oblivion, and thus Clift was born.\r\n\r\nEverything got redone, fixtures, elevators, dining room, lobby; only the Redwood Room survived surprisingly intact (but with better lighting, accents, and furniture).

The host was kind enough to get us a great seat location even though we had not reserved a table.  After dinner we came back and sat in the \"Living Room\" area outside the bar which was much better.  By this time, the bar was swarming with men and women over dressed for an SF night out, and the music was WAY too loud to carry on a conversation.  I think there was a huge amount of tourists last night seeing as this is Fleet Week.\r\n\r\nMy friend is in town from the Netherlands for business.  He's staying at the Clift and that is why we chose Redwood Room.  Location convenience.  Hopefully he's going to expense the drinks because the average drink price last night was about $13 without tip, and we each had 4 drinks in the course of the evening.  Do the math or not. . .\r\n\r\nInventive drink menu I will say, and again, the service was really great.  In the future though, if I want a fancy drink at a cool hotel lobby bar. . .it's the St. Regis for me but if you're in the area and someone has an expense account, hit the Redwood Room for some laughs.\r\n\r\n*vodka martini was excellent, and if you're into a sweet drink once in a while, the lychee martini was tasty as was the lavender infused lemon drop.  That drink was like dessert.", "author": "James M."}

Some hopeful has cornered a large sofa and is trying desperately to get the uninterested woman he is sharing the couch with to give him her number.

I won't ruin it for you, but it's definitely very interesting.\n\nI've never had a bad drink at The Redwood Room.  They definitely don't stiff you on the amount of liquor mixed in to each drink.  They are pricey, though, so don't expect to walk out without losing some weight in your wallet.  And if you have the opportunity, get some food - especially the calamari and/or the Cuban Opera (layered chocolate cake).  \n\nWithout a table, as I said, this is just another hotel bar with a bunch of older men in town on business and more than your fair share of attractive women to help you lighten the load on your wallet.

From the moment you step foot in to the Redwood Room until the moment you leave the staff will take excellent care of you.\n\nThis is a place to go if you have a few friends who you like to hang out with and you call ahead to get a table.

Damn, did I go to the right place. The lounge is part of the Clift hotel and boasts one of the sleekest designs of any bar in the City, at least that I've seen. Dim lighting, high ceilings, a long bar with towering, back-lit shelves of booze, interesting array of leather and translucent-illuminates sofas, chairs and benches, and these absolutely absurd framed \"portraits\" of random individuals hanging from the wall. Quotation marks necessary because they aren't paintings, but digital films made to look like paintings, and they're basically creepy people giving the camera a dead-on stare for several minutes. Kind of like something out of the Adams Family. \n\nThe scotch was good -- no Johnny Walker Red in this place, only Black Label -- and pricey but not out of the range of what I'd expect from a place like this. By far one of the best-dressed, best-looking, moneyed crowds of any bar in the Tendernob.

It looks like Tim Burton's Beetlejuice version of hell. In the lobby of the Clift hotel is a fireplace and a chair that is about ten times the size of a normal chair. Sit down on the couch and you'll find that it's structured by bones. Go to the bathroom and you'll find yourself wandering down a dark corridor until you find the bathroom door. Once you open it you'll be blinded by a white light. Go back out and your eyes will hardly be adjusted enough to the darkness to take you back to your friends. \n\nThe bar area has a lot of dark woods. People are staring as you pass by, and that includes the portraits on the walls. Finally find the bar and you'll be charged for really steep drink prices. And when you finally get to sit down and observe, you'll start to find that you aren't really surrounded by San Franciscans anymore. \n\nPersonally, I'm fascinated by this place - so fascinated that I've half expected to turn around and find Beetlejuice to be staring at me drooling - instead, I've had close: I've been stalked twice here already (one with a heavy Italian accent and another with a heavy slurring accent). On the other downside, it was hard to get our entire group inside once they started to organize a line outside. We all slowly filtered in within the course of an hour.

The Redwood Room throws an awesome Halloween party, New Year's event, and for my business clientele and friends visiting San Francisco, it remains my number one choice.  Table reservations are a plus and recommended so you don't have to fight the \"doesn't anyone know who I am\" crowd.  Friendly regulars are there if you have time to mingle and the crowd dresses up a little more than the average bear.\n\nLocated near Union Square's shopping district I always end my holiday purchases with a Mind Eraser (not on the menu for obvious reasons).  Yes, you can enjoy a glass of wine instead but the drinks they offer are generally unique and worth the buck.  Lavender martinis and mango mojitos make me happy any old time.\n\nNot for people who bitch about $10-$15 drinks.  Not a good place to meet someone you'd like to date.  You do (a little too often) find that cocky, business clad asshole from the midwest in the wrong place with too many alcoholic shots in his belly. Not the place for sweats and tennis shoes.\n\nDefinitely a good place to start with cocktails and appetizers after work.  Definitely a fine place to get a \"designer drink\".", "author": "Leslie A."}

When we sat down at some free chairs, which was limited that night, the waitress came up to us and said that it was reserved. I told her I didn't see a reserved card. She said,  \"well you can sit there until they show up, can I get you a drink? At this point I felt like walking out, but when I found out they had Chimay beer, I changed my mind. We had been walking around Union Square all day and I was in need of a refreshing brew, so we ordered up some drinks. Being a hipster comes at a price and the drinks were mighty pricey.\n\nI have to say, I really like the design of the Redwood Room, the backlite bar was impressive, as were the large chairs at the entrance of the bar.

We went inside, got a couple of tasty but expensive drinks, and sat down with a bunch of Norwegian businessmen in their 50s who were in town for vacation. They apparently heard about this place from their driver, which gives you a sense of they type of guys that come to this place. We all had a good time, talking, flirting, and then went on to our merry ways.\n\nI probably wouldn't come back to this place again. Just not my type of scene, unless I want to get ogled by older men who try to hide the fact that they're married with families back in their countries/states. (Some don't hide it at all; their rings are apparent.) Upside is, the clientele is mostly older and urbane, so conversations aren't dull.

Awesome!  The tall bar also looks pretty cool, with a back lit-yellow glow.\n\nThat said, the people in this place were definitely the striped shirt/breast implant crowd, which brings it down a couple of stars.

Who can't appreciate expensive but wonderfully-crafted cocktails, yuppie crowds that can occasionally let loose (or give you a good laugh) and a beautiful, ambiant lounge? But the bartenders/servers here always seem understaffed and the crowd was just flat out AWFUL the last time I was here. Everyone (wannabe fashionistas, I'm looking at you) takes themselves too seriously and there's no control over who waltzes in, despite burly bouncers manning the door. For instance, somehow a girl in terry cloth hot pants and a cotton tank top got inside, where she proceeded to dance by herself the entire time splashing her drink everywhere. Upon motioning this monstrosity to the hostess, she proceeded to give us a bashful WTF look and said there was nothing she could do. Perhaps she was a \"lady of the night,\" since RR is kind of unofficially known as some quasi-escort hangout.

Something sexy if fine.\nMe: Ok I'm not really looking to be seeeeen. Are nice jeans ok?\nClift Lady: Sure and a sexy top.\nErrrr.. so we get there at 10:45 and there is a pitiful line about 10 deep. We're forced to wait. For what, I can only wish I never learned. Then a scroungy group of people walk up, sweet talk the bouncer, and get in before us. Bouncer says, \"yeah you guys are hotter but they reserved a table.\" Eek.\nSo we get in and it's chaos.

I left my stuff with some friends and chased after her, and a couple of people followed. She couldn't be convinced to leave, so while she was the only one out of all of us who was actually at the bar and able to get the bartenders attention- the rest of us were awkwardly pressed against strangers wearing axe spray- a friend who was behind me asked me to tell her to order him grey goose martini.. like we were playing the game telephone, only the one in our nightmares. She ordered all the drinks, somebody threw down for hers, and she left. So, being the tallest and most able to fill the 3\" vacancy she left, that made me the front woman in the group.

Your man  is an as!*hole. \nSuit: Yeah he has the worst job in the world. Thanks.\nHA! He has the worst job in the world? My friend tipped him $2 for one drink and 30 seconds of his time, even after he sassed us like a little cry baby. \nPerhaps Redwood Room should consider carding people who actually look under 21 (25% of the female population that night), not just the innocent bystanders who refuse to buy a drink that costs $15. \n2 stars only because the digital art and giant chair were semi interesting to look at while I was thinking of somewhere I'd rather be.", "author": "Colleen L."}

The food menu is also pretty pricey. Not your average bar grub here. Service was very attentive. Crowd seamed to be a mix of business and visitors.

More specifically, there are a lot of people pretending that they are more important than they really are and a good number of older guys out on the prowl for young women.  While i suppose there is nothing wrong with either in and of itself, the whole shtick just gets a little old.  \n\nIf you are willing to pony up the cash to stay at the hotel, you get free queue-less entry and entry through the front of the Clift.  Otherwise plan on getting there early or waiting in the line at the side of the building for a bit\n\nDrinks are priced right about where you would expect them to be considering the city and the venue.  Anyone interested in rum, try the Oronoco.  This Brazilian rum, which comes in a half leather, half glass bottle, will set you back $16 a glass, but it is well worth it (and don't you dare mix it with coke or any other mixer!).\n\nRedwood room is worth a visit if for no other reason than its classy and beautiful decor, but overall there are better places to spend your Friday and Saturday nights.", "author": "Socrates M."}

The pics of Gustav Klimt's artwork, including The Kiss, prompted some interesting conversation. My only complaint about dining here was the parking, which cost $50!

He literally could had been anyone on the street trying to steal my vehicle. The Clift should probably work on making them more identifiable. So I just refused to give him my keys, checked into the hotel, then afterwards parked at a different garage near by for a cheaper price. Besides that, I had an excellent experience! The highlight by far was the historic Redwood Room. It was a Friday night and the place was alive....literally. Even the art on the walls were moving to the music and atmosphere. The DJ played excellent electro/hip hop/soul music all night & the bartenders were on point! There did seem to be a couple corporate, pompous, overbearing jerks in the room trying to show off their wealth or pick up on any lady that passed by but they're everywhere nowadays, right?

It varies from contemporary modern, to functional abtract, to rouge velvet couches which you can curl up on at any hour.  In the living room, the walls have tiles of animal photography.  The wood walls are chic with heavy velvet curtains.  Music is hot too, keeps you grooving.  Drinks wise - this place has the BEST APPLE MARTINI in town!!!!

The women were stilletoed and looked like they were on a mission.  The place looked like it was decorated by the likes of a modern day sherlock holmes....dark wood paneling, big chairs...Old English librariesque feel.

Doesn't matter.  I've been here many times.  I do not have lots of money.  I am not looking for a high-priced hooker.  As such, I have two strikes against me.  But when there is shite else going on in town, I like to come here to pay $14 for a manhattan, give the waitress a $20, and then promptly not see her ever again.  I like to think that I \"gave\" her that $6 tip so that she could give herself one dollar for taking forever to get to us and then taking forever and 1 day to bring our drinks back; I would have expected her to give the other $5 to the models in the moving pictures on the wall.  Because I sure as hell did not think she was entitled to take all $6.  What?  Those moving picture frames are recorded?  Oh I thought there were people in little cutouts in the wall.  I would've expected Nothing Less from Ian.\n\nAll sardonic wit aside, the room is beautiful.  The people can be beautiful.  The hostess last Saturday night was very accomodating and once she realized we'd drop cash on a table, she actually sat us at the perfect table.  The $400 bottle of Dom was a little pricey.  But, cmon, who are we kidding?  And split between 5 people it's really not that outrageous given the $14 manhattans.  Did I mention the $14 manhattans?  Believe it or not, not nearly as outrageous as the $24 (after conversion) Smirnoff and tonic I purchased in Ibiza this summer.  Everything is relative.

When I stood up to get another drink (I had already put a lien on my house so I can afford a second round) I had to push and fight my way through a sea of gorgeous European and Asian women. Maybe it was me, but some even seemed to get in my way on purpose so I had to interact with them. One grabbed me. Others have commented on the male:female ratio but I must have been there on a full moon because I had the opposite experience. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to go again, though, since I am not into the aggressive \"are you money enough\" or \"just do me\" attitude.

I was here a couple Saturdays ago and I honestly didn't think anything bad with this bar until after I encountered a problem with the bartender, who, if I am not mistaken, may have been Mexican. He at first was having an argument about a tab with another customer. That should have already told me not to order from him but I did anyway, not thinking that I may be arguing with him about my tab a few minutes later. I guess there was a misunderstanding that I was paying for another person's drink. Anyway, before handing him my card, he had given me a receipt that charged me for 3 drinks, which is what I ordered. I gave him my card and the receipt that I had to sign reflected a higher amount than what the original receipt had stated. I didn't sign and asked him why he charged me more than what I had ordered. Instead of fixing the problem, he took back the first receipt and added another drink to the tab so that it was equivalent to the amount he had swiped my card for. I was furious about what just happened and asked for the manager. He brushed me off like it wasn't his problem and began arguing with me. He wasn't having it so I spoke to the cocktail waitress and again was brushed off like it wasn't her problem.  I finally got another bartender's attention and she immediately called the manager without me having to explain the situation. When the manager came out, the original bartender stood there while I explained what happened and the bartender had the audacity to practically call me a liar without saying it to my face. Being a bartender myself, the way the situation played out was just plain shady. I'm sorry but bartenders like that shouldn't be working in that environment especially when you do not know one thing about customer service. It makes me wonder how he got hired in the first place because he was rude and completely unprofessional. Because of that one bartender, my experience with this place is not at all pleasant and will probably not be coming back to this bar at all.", "author": "Em D."}

First off, the room is gorgeous as is the bar - hence the bar's name.  But things kind of go mediocre from there.  It is always a different crowd in there - I feel like it has a big international scene (maybe from people staying at the hotel?) and gets a few socialites.  The biggest issue I have with this place (outside of the overpriced drinks) is the air of exclusivity.  For example, if no one is in line outside waiting to get in and it is 1:00 AM on a Friday night (or Saturday morning more accurately) the doorman will make you wait outside for a few minutes just to give the appearance of the club's exclusivity and popularity, neither of which I find to be the case.  So we wait for five minutes outside and get in and the place is not even close to full - sure, there are people there, but you can easily get up to the bar for a drink.  Lame!  I just hate these places in SF that try to be Hollywood.

So for my first experience, I would give the Clift five stars. I have to knock it down a few because the second time I invited a friend to a local spot (I live nearby) and, as a courtesy, we should have been told as we paid $30+ for two drinks that we only had 5-7 minutes to drink them. C'mon...paying that much for drinks, this is not a kegger at a frat house. The lights came on a couple minutes after we ordered our pricey drinks, and a seemingly coked-out bouncer hovered over us yelling it was time to move 'em out like we were cattle. We left our drinks three-quarters full, because we aren't sloths. All in all, I apologized to my friend and was embarrassed that I talked this place up so much.

But with the very wide range of people and ages that visit this place, theres always a little something for everyone.  The Redwood Room can definately get packed and sometimes over crowded, drinks are a bit overpriced (but I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere) and there's no dance floor (which doesn't seem to stop me, or anyone else for that matter, from doing a little booty shaking), but the people who work here are incredibly nice and friendly for a seemingly pretentious place and while I may not come here on a weekly basis, I would never oppose an occasional visit.", "author": "laura q."}

The rich textures of wood paneling, cushy seating, and warm, subdued table-lamp lighting make you just want to reach out and touch all available surfaces --- including those of your stylishly outfitted bar-mates! I've seen the damning reviews, and would admit it's not a place for every week, but I think you just need to go with the flow, an open mind, and gravitate towards the right folks. Almost every time there (with the possible exception of weekends, when there's a more bridge-and-tunnel crowd) I've had a deliciously lascivious or tactile experience with someone I just met.  Sorry folks (well, not really), but there some things you just can't resist!  One attractive, elegant woman who struck up a conversation explained that she lived back and forth between NY during the week and SF on weekends, and when I asked what she did to necessitate such an itinerary, she slowly passed her tongue over her upper lip and replied, \"everything.\"  Was she working? Probably, but I still enjoyed the sensuously shared sentiment. Another time, a gorgeous woman walked up to me, put her arms around me and asked if I was from Survivor; two minutes later we were locking lips and touching torsos. The best part is, that was 6 months ago and we're still close.  Jeez, why don't I go there more??  I guess I don't want to jinx it, which is probably too late now that I've shared it with John Q Public. But if you're into sensory indulgence, this place delivers!  Word of caution though, be ready to pay elite prices: I shelled out $14 for a glass of Brazilian rum called Oronoco that the bartender recommended, and which in all fairness turned out to be sumptuous, smooth, and is now my favorite spirit splurge.

Otherwise, it's one of the few places that will be familiar to those from LA/Gotham (I guess Ian Schrager has his formulae as well) and is thus oversubscribed, especially by conventioneers who keep glancing around the room.  They've got their polo collars turned up and ready, wedding bands tucked away and are ready to go full throttle.

Everything is expensive!  This a special night out kind of place, or conversely, if you are traveling to the City, a night out on the corporate tab.  Every single time I've gone, 2 drinks and a appie cost close to $100 a person.  Take it easy on the high end drinks (starting at around $18) and work the slow buzz . . . .  An unsolicited tip for the guys after getting hit on in this place:  If you are too cheap to buy a lady a drink for $10+, don't go there in the 1st place, DON'T ask for the digits, and hit a local pub for $1 beer night!", "author": "A W."}

It has a cool bar called the Redwood Room on the ground floor. I have no idea what the rooms are like, but if you want a shi-shi type place, you will have fun people watching here. It is close to a lot of dive bars since it is near the Tenderloin (which is the pooest part of town with lots of homeless people - but trust me - there are homelss people everywhere in SF, they don't bite.) One of my favorite bars is down the street. You are still close to Union Square, shopping and all the theatres.", "author": "Scott R."}

It comes off more LA sometimes than SF. The place is beautiful and ecclectic. The moving photos--yea!   I go with friends and have a great time.

The modern interior and dark atmosphere it's worth going in one time.  The servers were nice but there was a security guy constantly walking around and bumping into people like he had 2 left feet.  Other than that it was fun.  The drink prices take a star away.", "author": "nino l."}

It's also a good place to take out of town guests to see something out of the ordinary.", "author": "Michael G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-06-04", "description": "I don't know why this place has only averaged 3 stars. I went on Saturday night not expecting much after reading some of the reviews on Yelp and I was pleasantly surprised.  The space is beautiful, the bartenders were really friendly, helpful, attentive, and made some kickass drinks.   And none of them copped any kind of attitude ( I'm definitely one who doesn't take kindly to attitude).  I'd go back in a heartbeat!", "author": "Lisa K."}
