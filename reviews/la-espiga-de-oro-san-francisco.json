The typical kind of spot I love for mexican food a dive with 100% hispanic people dining there, and the menu only in spanish to the point where as a Peruvian myself I couldnt tell what a few of the items were. I ordered a pork tamale amd cheese pupusa and both were nice and cheap.\n\n The tamale was already ready which makes sense given the process and the flavors were on point but it was almost all corn with a lunch meat slice size ammount of shredded pork inside rather then being stuffed. I had to wait 45 minutes or so for the to go cheese pupusa which is essentially a corn based cheese quesadilla you just toss on the huge grill for a couple minutes when it wasnt very busy but service was friendly and chill. It tasted good and had tons of cheese(who dosnt like plate full of melted cheese?) My only qualm and I say this as a non health nut who loves my greasy foods was it had a few inches deep of pure liquid cheese grease on the plate. I was too hungry to care and about went into a food coma on the walk home but it could have easily been dabbed with some paper towels before serving.", "author": "Sean G."}

Good amount of spice, delicious guacamole, and yummy crunchy and chewy bits of chicharonnes hidden inside.  I'm pretty sure my carne asada burrito was not supposed to come with chicharonnes, but it did.  And, I'm not complaining.\n\nI will echo though some of the comments of other Yelpers that they are rather slow.  It honestly appeared as if there was only one chef in the back and the orders were coming out one-by-one.  By taqueria standards, this was a rather slow process and what we thought would only be a 10-15 minute stop turned into 20-25 minutes which was much more than we had allotted for.", "author": "Jess Y."}

The cheese was a nice factor - it melted in such a way as to really round out the consistency. \n\nOne downside is that they don't seem to equipped to speak in English.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-10-23", "description": "The best burrito on the planet, hands down. SF's ultimate arbiter of burritotaste that was Burritoeater.com may now be defunct but his assertion that this hole-in-the-wall has no rival continues to be true to this day.\n\nWHY is this the best burrito? It's a combination of key elements. First, all of their ingredients are fresh and well-prepared; you're getting actual marinated carne asada in these burritos and not just charred brisket that is only redeemed as part of other more favorable components. The combination of cheese, rice, and beans is really unusual and savory in a way that's difficult to describe other than I've never had anything quite like it in another burrito. And, they grill the tortilla perfectly so you have the right amount of crunchy texture and smoke complimenting the contents of the burrito and not some wet, spongy, elastic mess like you often get at La Taqueria. Carne Asada and Super Pollo burritos here are seriously the best.\n\nOther menu items are quite good as well. Cheese pupusas are extremely flavorful and rich. The Guisado De Chile Verde dish is extremely hearty and full of very generous chunks of pork - warning, this one is over-the-top as far as heartiness is concerned so if you're like me you might get a little overwhelmed by the richness of the pork in this dish.\n\nThe only con really is that the location is pretty inconvenient to all public transport so you'll likely need to either drive here or pay $20+ for you burrito via Postmates. Even then I'd say it's worth it.", "author": "Matt M."}

That's why it's taken me so long to give it a try, but I was strolling on 24th in the middle of a brisk Saturday afternoon. Truth be told, I had already had lunch in the Castro and wasn't really hungry. Still, it was the rare sight of this place in a nearly empty state that forced my mind to go into a clickety-clack mode trying to justify having a snack here before dinner. I had heard so much about La Espiga De Oro from various foodie blogs that I thought a little indigestion would be a worthy price to pay to get a taste of the food here. As I walked up slowly to the small order window, I began to notice how comprehensive the overhead menu was. I needed to study it and let others go ahead of me.\n\nAh, I see pupusas. Just one would do me, so I ordered the $2.99 Pupusa de Queso (photo: http://bit.ly/1FtCqfV). I could tell the masa was freshly made because it had a silkier texture than most, but it was rightfully blistered from being hot off the grill. The cheese was already oozing out of it from the steam. Some fresh curtido and tomato salsa made the ideal topping (photo: http://bit.ly/1BDi89h). Good stuff. As you guessed, it's a compact spot. There's a dining counter against the wall and a few tables set further back (photo: http://bit.ly/1fowRKP). I'm guessing my future orders will be to go. In case you want to know, La Espiga de Oro means The Golden Spike, which may have some historical reference, but makes me recall one of my favorite watering holes in North Beach. But that's another story...\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...a cheesy pupusa is all I had but it was enough to make me want to come back for more\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...tight fit in here, expect to take it to go\nSERVICE - 4 stars...fast if not friendly\nTOTAL - 4 stars...usually crazy-busy but this glorified taco stand in the Mission could be worth the trouble for you", "author": "Ed U."}

The well-know synergistic effects of Carne Asada juices and soft, orange beads of oil that is absent in many neighboring taquerias is fully showcased in each bite of this magnificently complete burrito.\n\nThe Carnitas burrito, that is stuffed so full of soft, seasoned meat, is obviously the byproduct of a chef with Thanksgiving-leftover Syndrome, which is characterized by the calculated urge to fill the Black Friday lunch sandwich with as much turkey as possible just to get it out of sight.  The Pollo burrito contains seasoned breast meat that is significantly less tender than the Carne Asada or Carnitas, but undoubtedly healthier and still tasty.\n\nWhen desiring lunch on a budget or a feast accessory, the homemade Tamales offer a rich, maize flavor and satisfactory proportion of meat, and can be dutifully assisted by the tangy, green salsa that impresses more with taste than spice in the squeeze bottles on the counter. \n\nThe pieces of Chicharron are kept warm at regulation temperatures, preserving its crispy exterior and fatty, acne-inducing interior in perfect balance, and the Papusas offer a substantially dense snack that dependably oozes melted cheese.\n\nDo not look any further, because La Espiga will fulfill any Mexican-food craving in this part of town!", "author": "Andrew M."}

And that's coming from someone who probably eats his weight in burritos every couple months.\n\nUsually I get a carne asada or chorizo burrito, and it's almost always simply on point. These folks must be wizards when it comes to perfectly grilling a tortilla in particular-- it's almost as flaky and delicious as a damn pie crust. The size is usually ample, the meat is tasty, and even the chips are quality (something a surprising number of places fail miserably at). \n\nAs if their unassailable burritos  weren't enough, this place may also be the king of \"dizzying number of good items\". The pupusas and tamales are also some of the best anywhere; the Guatemalan tamale in particular is awesome (and huge). Not enough? You can also buy huge slabs of chicarrones if you're in a particularly heart-punishing mood. The champurrado is great, although what I really love is their atol de elote (a hot corn-based drink, which I only ever tried because they gave me a free cup as they were finishing off the batch). \n\nTo round out the ridiculousness, they make their own tortillas, and you can buy masa as well (I use it in my chili). \n\nOh, and the people who work here are some of the nicest you'll ever find.

Ladies and gentlemen, this place is the real deal.\n\nEverything I've ever gotten from here has been excellent. They have an extensive selection of tamales in various styles. Though all are good, I particularly recommend the sweet ones for something unusual that you can't find at the myriad other taquerias on 24th. Their chicharrones are the best I've ever had, they're one of the few places that serve pozole on the daily, and their standard carne asada burrito is magnificent. \n\nThrowing a  taco dinner party? Need to impress a would be Abuelita? They also make cheap homemade tortillas to order by the dozen. They're just as good as La Palma's and sooo beat the storebought variety.

Bite into the burrito and you'll find howling spice, perfectly melted cheese, an ingredient mix which leaves no element overemphasized, extraordinary distribution of rice and beans, liberally applied avocado and some totally rad Carne Asada. A pause is in order to discuss this Carne, made from top sirloin, and grilled to smokey perfection, its saucy magic infusing every bite of the behemoth urban-food log which it resides within. As for the size of the burritos produced here, Brobdingnagian is probably the best (and most-polysyllabic) descriptor. To say that La Espiga makes the best Asada burrito in the Mission District is not hyperbole.\n\nIn non-burrito related business, the tamales are outstanding (go for the Guatamalen!) as are the pupusas (especially with Chicharrones...be still my heart!). Chips are freshly made (you can see them frying in back) and the salsa appropriately scorching. Service is extraordinarily friendly, and they'll go out of their way to remember a repeat customer. Expect to hear no English spoken after you place your order, Banda music blaring, and for the yellow walls to leave vivid afterimages playing upon your eyelids when you lean back and close your eyes in burrito-eating bliss.\n\nEat your heart out Farolito, La Espiga De Oro has won me over!\n\nExtras:\n\nThis was the site of the last rated burrito on the dearly-departed bastion of super-burrito rating: Burritoeater.com.\n\nAccessible by 48-Quintara/24th Street, 33-Stanyan, and all Mission corridor bus lines (including BART).", "author": "Casey U."}

I had a very simple one without meat, just beans, cheese and jalapeno.  I could eat these every day.\n\nHad a carnitas taco on the house tortillas.  You have to ask if you want the house tortillas for your taco, she said it cost more, but it's so inexpensive here that it's hard to see how it matters.  It was excellent.  The carnitas were less crispy than some places, but full of flavor.\n\nI asked about the chicharron that everyone talks about.  The woman in the window gave me one to try.  It was totally unique and very tasty.  I will have to try the chicharron burrito, but I doubt I can eat a whole one.  Maybe Baby Spike can share a small piece of his when we go together.\n\nThe service was great.  Sure, it's not much to look at when you're in there, a few tables and a counter.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-01", "description": "This is the best Mexican and Guatemalan food establishment in the Mission, hands down. I have visited many of the other restaurants various times (La Palma, El Farolito, Do\u00f1a Tere's, La Taqueria, El Metate, Papalote, etc) and La Espiga wins on all counts -- quality of food, customer service,  price -- except for the lack of a salsa bar and the weird hours they keep. The women that work at this restaurant run a tight ship!! Being a fluent Spanish speaker does help in placing an order -- much of the clientele and virtually all of the staff are Mission locals, although these Yelp reviews have spurred more visitors from other neighborhoods and cities. \n\nHere are the things that I have enjoyed at La Espiga:\n-Super Carne Asada Burrito: The meat is AMAZING. Perfectly cooked, never gristly or tough, has just a touch of browned crispy bit on the outside of each piece, and always is a generous helping. There is a sizable amount of cold crema and fresh avocado wrapped into the crispy-yet-chewy tortilla. They also know how to wrap the burrito so that the fillings are well-distributed so that every bite is perfect. It's best to stick to carne asada rather than any other filling (I've had the veggie and the carnitas ones, respectively, and they are not as great). \n\n-Super Carne Asada / Carnitas Tacos: The meat is always perfectly cooked. Do yourself a favor and ask for a \"tortilla a mano\" (handmade tortilla) instead of a \"regular\" tortilla -- it's slightly thicker/puffier, always piping hot, and part of the reason that these tacos are the best I've had in the Mission. These tacos also come with pickled vegetables on top, which are a fabulous and unique addition to add some vinegar-y goodness to all the dairy and meat goin' on.\n\n-Atol de Nuez (a cornstarch drink made with walnuts): If you want a soothing, filling warm drink on a foggy SF morning (the place opens at 6am...), opt for this. \n\n- Pupusas de Frijol con Queso / Revueltas: Best pupusas in the Mission, as well. The repollo (marinated cabbage slaw that comes with an order) is to die for -- I always slather it over the top of the pupusa. and the salsas that La Espiga has are always fresh and with the right amount of spice. \n\n-Flautas: This is probably the only item I've had from La Espiga that was less than stellar. The flautas are just average flautas. \n\n-Tamales de Pollo: Dynamite. Generous portion of chicken, the masa is always moist, and the tamales are a pretty good bargain.\n\n-Tortilla chips: Just to explain how good these are, it suffices to say that other restaurants in the neighborhood go to La Espiga to purchase chips to serve to their customers. \n\n-Frijoles/Arroz: Very dependable when ordering a platillo (entree-sized plate that normally has sides).\n\nThis place is amazing.", "author": "Ariel W."}

There are a few key points of interest at L.E.d.O. \n\nOne cannot and should not leave without ordering a Guatemalan tamale. This is no mortal tamale. Instead, you get a rather hefty sized packet of the silkiest masa you have ever encountered enclosing an entire braised chicken drumstick, all wrapped up in a banana leaf. The masa is amazing, so creamy and savory; these are addictive.\n\nOne also cannot and should not leave without purchasing a bag of chicharrones by the lb. The owner explained to me that they don't just fry pork skin, they use actual long, thick strips of meaty pork belly for their chicharrones. Although they are amazing chopped up and put into burritos and tacos, I like to serve pieces of them for an indulgent pre-dinner bite. \n\nThe owner also explained that not only does L.E.d.O. make their own masa and tortillas, but they also grind the corn to make their own flour. The tortillas are good, but my favorite are the bags of house-made tortilla chips, so good! These are not thin and wispy chips, they are rather substantial and will stand up to all salsas and dips. \n\nThe pupusas are freshly made and also quite good. \n\nOther than a few small tables and a few counter seats, there's not a lot in the way of ambiance or seating.", "author": "Candice L."}

I just can't seem to take another bite yet.  It's still standing upright here on my desk (proudly, with that gaping grin burrito's have) daring me to hit it.  Dammit I will finish you Espiga burrito 'cause by gods I aint disposing of it anywhere but in mah belly!\n\nWhy so good?  Lemme start by saying I was pleasantly surprised by a particular ingredient largely under appreciated by burrito aficionados -  the flour tortilla.  None of that \"manky\" wet dishtowel taste.  Not the near-flavorless chewy blanket we're all accustomed to.  It's delicious, fresh-tasting, grilled until it's flaky just-so and worth every one of the hundreds of calories required to wrap and contain the innards of a super burrito.  \n\nInside the log, tasty bits of chicken simmered in a sublime tangy salsa roja dances with the taste buds and piquant chili warms the throat.  This lame purple prose of mine is making me want to bite it again despite the gurgling warnings of my gut.  Onion, cilantro, tomato, cheese, earthy pinto beans green chili - it's all in there in almost ideal proportions.  It's dripping a little on account of that simmered chicken however I did not mind licking my hand clean.  \n\nI might lick your hand clean too if you tell me where it's been before it gripped an Espiga-rrito!  No, not really.\n\nAnyway, until today I went to The Golden Ear for it's tamales and pupusas  - which are both excellent.  Their masa rocks.  Their curtido is delicious.  They don't make your pupusa until you order it so give em a few tics and you'll be rewarded with a toasty, melty treat (yes... even those bits of crunchy cheese that burst from the pupusa :) ).  The tamales?  All in the masa.  Not chewy overkill, light and full of corn flavor. \n\nMkay I think I've worked off a portion of the burrito typing this novelette so Imma bite it again and see how it tastes cold.  Yep.  Still better cold than most others are hot.  Somehow I've got to find the room to eat the heel of this amazing tortilla.. I just can't let this thing beat me!

All the right stuff in all the right places!\n\n I had been craving a burrito for a couple weeks and had sadly been unable to grab one...until today.  After  a trip to REI with the GF we took the short trip over to 24th and hit up a small, but highly recommended taqueria.  I got chicken super burrito, she got the carnitas.  \n  Chicken was great, zero complaints.  Sour cream glued it all together, the whole pinto beans perfectly balanced with pico and toasty tasting chicken.  The burrito also held together until the end-not a drop spilled.  I was even indulging in the chips and salsa while eating said burrito.\n  THe carnitas was a different story. Big perfectly placed chunks of carnitas were in each bite.  THey were slightly crunchy on the outside and o so tender on the inside.  Made with serious love.  Again, nothing overpowered the super carnitas burrito.  everything was balanced and it held together perfectly.  \n  Next trip....the papusas and chicharrones!", "author": "Rob B."}

I also ordered a couple of the sweet tamales (elote and pineapple). I'm sure their other food is delicious, but both the tamales and the champurrado were so sweet that I had to throw them out after a few tastes. (Disclaimer: I routinely halve the amount of sugar called for in most cake, cookie, and cupcake recipes.) I ended up making my own champurrado based on recipes from the internet, and I have to say it was way better--spicier, less sweet, and generally awesome. I should probably get a truck of my own or something.", "author": "Kristina B."}

As mentioned in previous reviews, their pupusas are definitely the item that sets them apart from the surrounding restaurants. Their tamales are fairly standard, with the vegetable one being my favorite as it is more unique and less bland. I feel they've increased their price over the last year, but still a good deal for the amount of food. One thing to note is they make their pupusas once ordered, so expect a decent wait when ordering them.", "author": "Erik V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-04-15", "description": "I had the best burrito I ever had in the Mission and perhaps in my life here at La Espiga.  I ordered the chicharron burrito since it was an uncommon menu item.  The lady at the counter let me taste their chicharron which included the crispy fried pork skin and fried pork attached to it.  This was hands down the best burrito I ever had (except maybe the CA sisig burrito from the Senor Sisig truck).  I've had a burrito from the Hapa SF food truck too where they include chicharron but they get soggy inside.  At La Espiga the chicharron is thick so however long it takes you to eat it, you will get a crunch in every bite.  Overall their burrito had amazing flavor. It's really hard to find parking nearby but it's worth driving around in circles to find a spot.", "author": "Kristy L."}

Baaad english (but extra sweet if you dust off your spanish, gringo) but nice folks.  Pupusas are generous and hand formed, and fried to a perfect crispy crust, Champurrado is thick with a warm and delicious spice, and nacatamales have a lovely chicken leg encased in a rich corn pudding with a spiced center and palm leaf wrapper.  Similar to the popular tamale salvadoreno, the nacatamale gives you delicious flavor and a silky texture without having to worry about an errant olive pit breaking your teeth.", "author": "Jamie B."}
