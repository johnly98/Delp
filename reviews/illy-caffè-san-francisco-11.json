Combined with beverages served in actual glasses, it makes for quite an urbane coffee break.  While the coffee is on point, the snacks could use a little work.\n\nBlack & White Whoopie Pie: The cakes tasted a little stale.  The cream was a bit tangy like Red Velvet frosting.  It was a rather unexciting use of afternoon snack calories.\n\nMeyer Lemon Bar: A lot better than I expected.  Quite smooth and tangy, with mostly filling and only a little crust (just the way I like).  Also, it didn't have that funky sour milk smell that a lot of lemon curd has.\n\nCaff\u00e8 Mocha: Nowhere near as sweet as the equivalent at Starbucks.  But I'm ok with that since it lets you still appreciate the coffee.  The largest size available is a medium, but is just the right size to sit and enjoy from a proper glass at the cafe.\n\nNitro Coffee: This was quite foamy, like a Guinness.  Went down very smoothly.  Didn't taste as bitter as other nitros around town.", "author": "Adam B."}

In fact, it's the only EUROPEAN (Italian) coffee option.  The marketing is fantastic, with all that juicy red and white.  They back it up with good coffee, especially their almond lattes.  Seating is not so easy, inside at least, but you can often stool it.  What I really hate is their archaic method of having you sign the credit card receipt, a receipt that, surprisingly, includes a tip line-item and total to be filled-in.  I don't like being put in a position where I face the cashier and let them watch me write-in how much I decide to tip.  I like these things to be reconciled when I am long-gone like when the waiter picks-up the bill after the party has left the table.  It's not that I don't want to tip; rather, it's because I just don't want to be a witness to any good or (deserved) bad outcome for the server, I don't want thanks OR no-thanks talk and gestures as a consequence.  So what I am saying is that the whole receipt shtick is cheap and pushy.  I don't see this kind of tip-desperate behavior when I go to the American coffee chains - they just run your credit card and don't even ask for a signature.  And, ironically, it's in EUROPE where they don't tip?!?!? What's also mildly annoying is how bubbly they are.  I'll be the first to admit that I am not one for small talk.  I just want my coffee.\nSo what am I saying... hmmm... well, they have good coffee and the other things are like... meh.  To the store I suggest you guys get with the times.  They have these chip cards now that, although slow at times, verifies a card extensively never needing signatures.  And please stop extorting tip the way you guys are doing it now with the unnecessary receipt signings.", "author": "Khash C."}

A traditional cappuccino is 1/3 espresso, 1/3 steamed milk, and 1/3 milk foam.  A run-of-the-mill cappuccino has more milk, and a dry cappuccino has less or no milk.  That's what makes a cappuccino.  A latte has its shot(s) at the bottom, topped with a bunch of milk, and then a dollop or two of foam on top.  \n\nI asked the cashier what the difference between a cappuccino and a latte is at illy, and she said, \"there's a little less milk in a cappuccino.\"\n\nFace-palm.

Usually it will be at a long counter with the whole row of espresso cups lined up with all the patrons come and grab one.\n\nThis is more like a fancy cafe where if you want to sit and enjoy a conversation with some pastries. The way they take out the pastries is like taking out some jewel from the glass case (in this case I think it's plastic but looks sparkling translucent), delicately. I have to admit, the fancy way how the case door opens up, instead of more typical sliding door, is like opening a lambo vs a cab door. Because, also then, the cafe has lots and lots of space.\n\nItalian beans, in my books, are lighter roast and more delicate. The taste is smoother than a punch, but the strong current still electrifies you afterwards.\n\nI had a cannoli and it was also very, very delicious. This is the kind of cafe where you can enjoy a breakfast jolt, an afternoon pick-me-up, or a late mellow out afternoon.", "author": "T L."}

I'm only in the city twice a week so it took me a few days to get back for it and I even brought my spouse with me. I can see why they would prefer to make this drink as a single, since the bitterness of the coffee and the bitterness of the cloves play off of each other. But I just need two shots of espresso in the morning to start my day right! And it's still a delicious drink.

Holla!\n\nI see an Illy sign right across the street so we go after an unsuccessful trip to the glasses store. I tried the Lavender Mint latte at Prima Cosa or something like that in FiDi a month or so ago, and I didn't find enough flavor in it. I'm also a bold, full body drinker so I felt like I was drinking water. I did vow to try Illy again, though.\n\nHere, I tried the Jasmine Vanilla latte. What. The. F. It had SO much Jasmine flavor in it which severely messed up my palate. I kept an open mind and allowed the overpowering Jasmine to settle on my palate. Keep drinking it, very subtle vanilla comes through. Keep drinking it, the delicacy of the Illy espresso shines through the deep, dark mess of Jasmine.\n\nI have to say, I could definitely enjoy Illy if it wasn't bombarded in too much flavor. Which is a surprise to me, considering my initial reaction to both lattes I have tried. \n\nAs far as pricing/interior goes, I guess its nice inside...but I'm sure pricing is steep because of the rent they pay in that particular location.\n\nCustomer service? Is that even a thing at Espressamente? Bf gets a croissant. Takes about five minutes for the cashier who \"helped\" us to throw it on the counter without informing either of us that it was ready. Thanks dude, we love cold croissants that are warmed up but already cold again by the time we actually eat it because we had no idea it was ready. I also had to wait quite a while for my latte when there were only two drinks ahead of mine - an espresso and an Americano. WHAT.\n\nI do understand the whole high fashion espresso movement considering I work at Nespresso on Grant and Geary, but compared to us and in my general opinion, Espressamente/Illy is pretty much junk. \n\nI'm still willing to find a good Illy barista to make me a good Illy espresso, but I wouldn't go out of my way.", "author": "Heather M."}

I used to frequent the Starbucks (it was close to my office)  that occupied the space previously and it's nice to have another coffee option to help me stay peppy during the workday.", "author": "John B."}

The cost for a cup of coffee is expensive which I don't mind but do expect good service and better than average coffee. I've been dissappointed with how weak the coffee is. When I complained about wanting to get stronger coffee my server Jordan told me to get back to the long line to buy more coffee. Jordan said that I couldn't just cut the line.  I bring many clients to illys because it is convenient but it is difficult to take poor service and below average coffee. I agree that the location is perfect but the servers can use some customer service training.", "author": "Carmen W."}

I, too, am a working stiff with a penchant for(real) European cafes and, more important, for exquisite coffee, despite my lack of big sunglasses and gaudy jewelry and a busy-print blouse. Not my style. But what IS my style are creamy espressos (check) and tiny things to eat (check). The mini ham and cheese croissant was perfect - a perfect Europortion. Service was great. Reserving the fifth star because I did think it was a tad expensive -- $9.25 for two doppio espressos and the mini H&C croissant -- but I'll definitely be back. Did I mention they had mini danishes?", "author": "Isabel P."}

Coffee is great, ambiance is awesome, and everybody who works there is super-friendly. Definitely give this a try; I'll be back very soon.", "author": "Omar B."}
