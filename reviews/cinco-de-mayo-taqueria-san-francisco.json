I ordered 2 tacos- 1 carne asada and 1 al pastor. There weren't too many customers at 6:30 PM weekday dinner time so my order was prepared quickly. I was in and out in less than 10 minutes!\n\nMy tacos were set on top of thin wax paper before being enveloped in tin foil. I was surprised by all the juices from the meat! There was enough for some to leak out of the foil, so I had to unfold the foil on a plate to prevent a messy dinner. But hey, who doesn't like juicy meat? One thing to note is that they cook the meat, onions, and cilantro together. Most places just add it as a topping. \n\nFlavor wise, I enjoyed the tacos. Despite it being 3.40 per, they gave a lot of meat. I had two tacos and was full for dinner. The pastor had a bit more fat/tendons and the asada was on the leaner side (which I preferred). On the downside, I'm wasn't a huge fan of the corn tortilla, but that's just my preference. I daresay this place uses some MSG in their seasoning as well.\n\nOverall, I would return on a day I am craving tacos or perhaps to try their regular burrito. With how expensive these tacos are, it might be more worth to go with that route instead. Naturally, these tacos can't compare to tacos from LA, but it's enough to satisfy a craving!", "author": "Amber T."}

I quickly scanned the menu and went for a super taco with steak which comes with cheese, guac, and sour cream for 5.30 instead of a regular taco for 3.50. If it was gonna cost me 5 dollars for a single taco, it have better be a really good taco. To my surprise, it was pretty huge. The meat, salsas, guac were all over the tortilla. The meat was tender and well seasoned. It also came with a bag of chips, which only had like less than 10 chips in there but it was absolutely the best chips I've had at a taqueria and it was well salted all over with a nice crisp. By the time I was done with my single taco, I was starting to get full. I felt that two would be just perfect to fill me up next time considering it was a pretty big taco. It may be a little bit on the pricy side, but the flavors are worth the extra buck!", "author": "Mandy C."}

It's like a scavenger hunt for me even though there is a real art in making a good bowl of it. Mexico Tipico has figured it out with their luxuriant broth, still the best one in town if you ask me, and so few others have. It's worth the exploration though, which is why I found myself in Portola, a melting pot neighborhood that's quite foreign to me. San Bruno Avenue is bustling with local residents shopping and eating, so it took me a while to get to this cavernous place right off Silver Avenue. I heard the menudo here was very good. We'll see about that. Anyway, I ordered a bowl for $8.85 and was met with a certain amount of indifference.\n\nNot that I'm all that hypersensitive to standard etiquette, but I actually considered turning around and leaving when the server turned out to be a rather curt woman who appeared resistant to taking my order. I don't know if I came across as someone who fell off a turnip truck at the border because she cocked her eyebrow and asked me point blank if I knew what menudo was. Well, girlfriend, I've had more menudo than yo mama. Don't you sass me, Se\u00f1ora Thing. Anyhow, I got over it and ordered a quesadilla just to make her feel better and sat down at a table in the back. It's a huge space, and there was only one other customer as it looks like most people come in for takeout.\n\nThe menudo came with all the standard fixings (photo: http://bit.ly/1zwZkpr). Once I put in the onion and oregano, I thought it was pretty decent (photo: http://bit.ly/1wEx0iU). It still lacked the hearty, spicy broth I keep looking for, but it did have plenty of tendons and bones, not so much on the tripe itself. The $3.10 Flour Quesadilla was nothing more than cheese melted between two tortillas, but it made a nice accompaniment to the menudo (photo: http://bit.ly/1zwZBbS). That was plenty of food, but alas, the scavenger hunt continues. It was not the transcendent bowl of goodness that makes my knees quiver and my stomach gurgle in delight. I did, however, manage to blow Se\u00f1ora Thing a kiss on the way out much to her constipated consternation.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...middling menudo is better than no menudo at all\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a big space does help with my digestion\nSERVICE - 1.5 stars...rudeness is not a virtue\nTOTAL - 3 stars...I'll overlook her cold stare and keep my rating in the middle", "author": "Ed U."}

Whether it's a hotter gf/bf or better paying position, we will never be satisfied. It's the nature of the beast. For me, I'm always searching for better lengua (albeit expensive, La Taqueria has the best in SF). I'll be honest though; nothing gets me more excited than being able to yelp yet another place. Pathetic, I know.\n\nI need to mention that I got food poisoning from Cinco de Mayo 10 years ago. I remember it like yesterday...I was helping with a retail store move when I threw up in front of 20+ people after having a burrito here for lunch. The slow-mo snapshot of everyone's face in horror will be forever ingrained in my head. Mortifying. Anyhow, given the overall 4 star rating, I decided to give Cinco de Mayo another shot but should have done a better job reading through the reviews. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion but I noticed several people mention that Cinco de Mayo has the best burrito they've ever had and it's also the first/only burrito they've ever had. Ironic much?\n\nI know I have been harsh in my recent taqueria reviews but Cinco de Mayo is deserving of no more than 2 stars for the following reasons:\n\n1. OVERPRICED\n$2.80 for a taco? $3.95 for a super taco? $9.90 for an el grande burrito? $13.70 for an el grande shrimp burrito? Are you f*cking insane? This is the ghettos (I grew up in this area) not Pac Heights or the Marina.\n\n2. NO SALSA BAR. \nNot a deal breaker but they don't even provide you with salsa in small plastic containers. WTF. \n\n3. RUDE CUSTOMER SERVICE\nI'm standing there waiting to order when the lady looks at me then the phone rings. She answers it and proceeds to take the order. I wait patiently until she's done and she looks at me again as if I'm bothering her.\n\nME: \"Do you happen to have wheat tortillas?\"\nLADY: \"No. Did you still want anything?\"\nME: *Woooooo Zaaaaaaaa*\n\nAnyhow, I ordered 3 lengua tacos which were sprinkled with raw onions, cilantro, and a dash of salsa verde. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4MvdxbwpYK8Ci4DH-HQguA?select=fK14tlwxICjIsDUX69iYEg No lime, pico de gallo, or salsa rojo was provided. How can you not have these staples?\n\nThe lengua wasn't stewed long enough nor seasoned well enough making it bland and semi-chewy. The juices from the lengua caused the corn tortillas to fall and break apart upon picking up the taco making them inedible. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4MvdxbwpYK8Ci4DH-HQguA?select=cyKLTMQ0iYPSzT-QY3YL-w \n\nCinco de Mayo is not horrible (does not compare to the taquerias in The Mission) but $9 for three tacos is a complete rip-off especially when a complimentary side of bitchassness is included with each order. NO GRACIAS!\n\nOTHER NOTES: \n*Meats available: carne asada (steak), pollo (chicken), carnitas (braised pork shoulder), al pastor (spit-roasted marinated pork), and lengua (beef tongue)\n*Burria (goat stew) and menudo (tripe soup) available on weekends \n*Closes early at 7 PM\n*Plenty of tables and seating \n*CC's accepted", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I discovered this place when I was a 7th grader and have been a life long fan ever since.  Ive had a lot of decent/good burritos in my life, but the one thing that sets this burrito apart from any other is how juicy it is.  The juice comes from the chicken, and whatever the eff they do to it when they put it on the grill.  But it blends perfectly with the liquidy guacamole, cheese, and sour cream to make this saucy awesomeness that moistens just about the entire burrito.  I have never found anything like it...most good burritos have high quality ingredients that taste good together, but definitely arent comparable to one that is, sort of \"blended\" together with said juice in the Cinco super chicken.\n\nI do have to say that the guacamole is not the best ive had, for sure.  Its, liquidy, not chunky.  But again, the overall burrito just works together on so many levels,  that I can't even say that I care.

No one is perfect I get it. BUT this time really threw me back on how they handle customer issues. \n\nThe food to begin with is average. Typical mexicano food. Inexpensive and is what it is. On several occasions  have ordered the super burrito with the guacamole and sour cream on the side, paid the price of a super but they were not included in my bag. Granted I should check before I leave, but at the same time as I am ordering this request they should be on top of it!\n\nToday was it. I ordered a super steak burrito- guacamole and sour cream on the side. The unfriendly girl at the counter asked me if I wanted inside. I said no on the side please. She repeated the question as to not understand me. I stated my request again and thought she got it this time. Few minutes later my burrito was up. After a long, hard day at work I just booked outta there with getting home to eat. I come home and feel in the bag there was no signs of my guac or sour cream. I thought \"maybe they put it inside instead\". I cut into it starving at this point and discovered I was charged for a super and got a sad regular. Not cool for this has happened before. \n\nI decided to call them to see what they would compensate since I paid for something I did not get. The girl answered the phone and I explained the situation and said I was already home. I explained this has happened before. I asked \"how will you compensate me?\" and SHE HUNG UP ON ME!!!!! I called back and said you hung up on me. She said come here and we make you another one. I stated I was not going back just to get my sides that should have been included. Rather than apologizing SHE HUNG UP ON ME AGAIN!!! I called the third time and spoke to her in Spanish. I asked for the owners name to which she replied she could not give his name out!!!!! WTF!!!??? This is NOT how you run a business!!!!!! I put my clothes on and headed there. \n\nI went in and it was busy. I asked the guy behind that counter who the owner was and that I wanted to return my food for my money back. He didn't even know what to say. He turned to this older gentleman who didnt give me his name as an owner, DID NOT apologize after I told him that the girl hung up on me twice. He went to the register that HE COULD NOT OPEN HIMSELF!!! Gave me the cash back and did not \nsay a peep. I told him that it was not the way to run a business nor would I be back. \n\nIt's a shame when you want to support your local businesses and they fail to recognize that their neighbors are the ones who are helping them achieve a successful business!!!!

The rice is moist and does not overpower other ingredients. You get your choice of whole beans or refried beans. Most importantly, they get your order right (unlike a famous taco place in the Mission). \n\nThe only complaint I have is the price...which is one of mexican's food most appealing factors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-01-06", "description": "This neighborhood taqueria is often quite busy.  During the late afternoon hours between 2 PM to 3 PM the place gets downright crowded with regular customers and school kids just getting out from class.  I had always noticed the popularity of the restaurant, but I never stopped in to try it until the recent holiday break.\n\nIt wasn't too busy during the noon time lunch time.  I was able to just walk in, look up on the big menu board overhead and place my order.  I was feeling especially hungry so I ordered the Burrito Mojado with pollo asado (grilled chicken) and a canned soda.  The Burrito Majado is a super burrito covered in enchilada sauce.  They have a nice assortment of canned soda, Mexican Coke, cold bottled beers and a couple of agua frescas.  Their food prices are a bit on the high side as my burrito and soda came out to just slightly less than $10.\n\nThe interior is very brightly lit with lots of seating.  Posters, trinkets, even a sombrero and ethnic attire decorate the saffron colored walls.  Authentic Mexican music plays in the background and there was even a television in the middle of the dining area airing Hispanic television.  Considering I was only one of three customers there at the time the food preparation time was quite lengthy.\n\nI sat for awhile before the young lady who took my order walked over with a basket of crispy chips and a container of fresh salsa (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4MvdxbwpYK8Ci4DH-HQguA?select=DIUqC2BqdxMcOYjmIkJfEw).  Well, I'm not sure how fresh the salsa was as the cilantro was wilted and tasted flat.  I finally got the huge burrito (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4MvdxbwpYK8Ci4DH-HQguA?select=8X1CUbm11Ws24caePGZaiQ) buried under a layer of grated Mexican cheese and a thick red sauce that appeared to be separating between the liquid and the pulp.\n\nThe pollo asado was outstanding and you'll get a very generous portion of it within the massive burrito overstuffed with rice, beans (choice of refried or whole pintos), sour cream and fresh salsa.  The overall taste of the burrito didn't strike my taste buds well however.  The taste of the tangy cheese overpowered the entire burrito which for some odd reason seemed overly salted too.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing on this first visit, but being in the neighborhood I'm certain I'll return one day to try something different.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

The chips are always crispy & crunchy, and when paired with the pico de gallo-- mmm mmm mmm!!

I just moved to the Portola in October of 2010. I didn't know the 'hood at all but I loved my place so I rented it. I have to say I'm really glad to be here and Cinco De Mayo is one of those things that makes me happy to be a Portolan (Portolian?) \n. \nChinese food abounds in Portola and I love the stuff. However, I'm from Southern Oregon and we love our Mexican food there. I have an actual NEED for Mexican food. My previous 'hood was the Mission here in SF. What I'm getting at is that I've had the chance to eat a lot of killer Messican food. I had modest expectations of this place because taquerias are hit or miss. This place is HUGE and usually seems empty because it's so big. I am happy to say that this place has consistently met my expectations and delivered good food. \n\nI've had burritos here and al pastor tacos. Their al pastor is my favorite. It's very tender and has a lovely flavor. What really pleases me about their food is that they have plenty of veggie options (whole beans), a small menu (which indicates freshness to me), and their food is NOT covered in inordinate amounts of grease, cheese, or other fattening additions. I recently had a taco plate and am happy to report that I was served portions a normal human could eat. \n\nMexican food isn't synonymous with healthy because it's often so Americanized and we love our fat. This place has the right idea of focusing on good, clean flavors. I don't feel bad indulging here from time to time. \n\nPlus, I love being greeted with a big smile every time I come in.

It's fast food pricing and top notch quality meats and ingredients.\n- Ninja speed service.  I barely soaked in the place before the food arrived.\n- Solid selection of Mexican standards.  Plenty to try, mix, and match.\n- A handful of authentic Mexican beers are also available, too.\n\n*Cons*\n- GHEETTTOOOOO!   If you're coming for dinner bring a weapon or guys with broad shoulders.  If they're wimps ask them to wear black hoodies so they'll blend in with the locals.  Or come in daylight.\n- My friends did not like the nachos/tortilla chips at all.

We have access to delicious burritos in pretty much every neighborhood of every city in the state (coastal cities at least, I try not to go inland). Well today I had a burrito that was truly exceptional. Allow me to elaborate:\n\nToday was a union holiday for most of the people in my office. I am not part of said union so I reluctantly went into work today with a plan of sitting at my desk for three hours and then sneaking out at two.\n\nI spent the entire time looking at yelp. I was happy to discover that according to yelp I live in Portola (hey, it's an upgrade from Excelsior!) so I decided to check out the restaurants available on San Bruno Ave in hopes of finding something for lunch.\n\nOf the dozen or so places listed Cinco De Mayo was second. I wasn't too excited at the thought of a burrito. I was looking for something more exotic, but the reviews were all great and I decided to duck out an hour early and head over. \n\nThe place is actually pretty big, but the whole back area is vacant with five or six tables situated in th front. The lady behind the counter was very friendly and recommended the carne asada burrito (as does pretty much every other reviewer on yelp) so I ordered the super to go. I watched the cook prepare it...it was a spiritual experience. He grilled the carne asada and some shrimp for another order, I decided right then that I would get carne asada and shrimp in my burrito next time. It was butterflied! Most places make you eat that disgusting poo filled vein that grosses me out. Anyway, the smells coming off that grill were heavenly! I was quickly given my aluminium wrapped bundle of joy and headed off to my apartment to devour it. Did I mention is was $7? I have a feeling some people would think that was expensive, but I am not a cheap ass so it was fine with me.\n\nI hadn't had breakfast and it was almost 2:00 when I got the burrito so I practically ran home. It was some intense power walking. As soon as I got in the door I grabbed a beer and dove into my burrito.\n\nIt was delicious. It was so beyond my expectations. The reviewers had it dead on. Because the carne asada is cooked when you order it, it is dripping with juices and oh so succulent. Often times (from lesser establishments) the meat will be all chewy and fatty...not so with this delicious beef brick. \n\nSo I just finished it and I am so content with my choice. A good third of the burrito is on my shirt right now, the stains are like little medals of honor from the most delicious battle I have ever been in. I am now going to sit here with my yum medals and enjoy being comatose.\n\npardon my spelling....wow that was a long review.", "author": "Justin H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-05", "description": "This is the taqueria that your mother warned you about. You know the one that she said would make you sweat grease after just one bite? The one that was supposed to be bad for you, but you later found out was real good to you? Yeah, this is the place.\n\nAfter four years away at college and away from what I consider to be authentic Mexican food, I ran straight to Cince de Mayo after moving back to SF and ordered the fattest burrito on the menu. I forgot the name of the burrito, but it's basically an upgraded, \"double the pleasure, double the fun, have two scoops of meat, instead of one\" version of their super burrito. I had mine with \"la lengua\" and everything on it. You can get all of the basic meats here, like the carne asada or the pollo asada, and all of your standard sides/veggies. The service was really fast and I got my burrito in about three minutes. When the cashier handed the burrito to me, I almost dropped it. No lie. I'm not a weak guy or anything, but I just wasn't prepared for a hefty, something-around-three pound burrito. The bag had the usual suspects: the burrito and some chips. I guess you can ask for salsa too, but I wasn't too worried about it.\n\nSo, I'm no burrito architect or rolling expert, but I like my burrito to be built in a certain way. I think all of you know what I mean when I talk about a burrito with all of the meat shoved into one corner and all of the sour cream and guac into another corner. Those burritos piss me off. Anyways, the point that I'm trying to make is that the guys behind the counter knew how to properly wrap a burrito. Every bite that I took was filled with just the right amount of meat, rice, beans, and salsa/sides. The meat was flavorful, the rice was moist and seasoned just right, the beans were beans, and all the flavors just came together really nicely. The only downside that I want to mention is the greasiness of the food: these guys aren't shy about putting a little extra oil and fat to bring everything together. With that said, you only live once, right?\n\nEnough about the burrito, let's focus on the chips now. A burrito will tell you about a taqueria's attention to detail, but the chips will tell you about a taqueria's dedication to the big picture. I think if you're going to put chips in my bag, you better mean for them to be there. I'm not the kind of person that takes kindly to the Chevy's style, paper napkin chips or the dried out, pre-packaged Tostitos. Anyways, these chips didn't disappoint. They were hefty, like the burrito, and thick cut so you won't get dirty looks from your girlfriend when you have to finger the broken chip out of the salsa that you're sharing with her. These chips had everything that you could want: a nice color, shape, texture, and crunch. Again, they were pretty greasy, but I didn't care too much.\n\nAlright, so here's the final breakdown for the stars from a baseline of 3:\n+1 for great portions for the price (~$10 for my ~8 inch burrito)\n+1 for having delicious, delicious burritos and chips\n-1 for sketchy looking sanitation, if you know what I mean", "author": "Frank Y."}

Teachers on the southeast side of the City are burrito connoisseurs (or they ought to be given the number of great taquerias around here) and we all agreed that these were pretty awesome.  \n\nAs per usual, one burrito is two meals unless you're crazy-hungry.  Not per usual: meat wasn't super-greasy, the beans were whole, and the salsa spicy.\n\nThe only drawback was when I was placing the phone order.  I had to correct them over ten times, and it wasn't a language issue, it was the person not paying attention to what I was saying (and I swear I wasn't talking a mile a minute--my coworker was listening and started to silently laugh his ass off as I repeated myself for the 9th time).  When he went to pick up everything, he noticed the people in front of him in the line having similar problems.  So 1/2 star off for that.  Also 1/2 star off for arguing with him about taking the small covered cups for salsa.  Our order was over $100, so I'd think that was worth $0.10 of plastic!\n\nStill, the food's awesome and they're a small business, so that's a win-win worth some a little extra frustration.", "author": "Jen D."}

I grew up around the south bay area where the Mexican food was below mediocre, then I moved down to southern california where it's supposedly the \"burrito mecca\", yet every time I have a burrito at King Taco per-say, I always happen crave a Cinco De Mayo burrito. There's something about their burrito that is so different than the others. When I bite into one, their carnitas are a perfect crisp, the carne asada has an explosion of flavor, and what's great about it is the el grande burrito can mix both of those meats into one! When you get to the middle of the burrito you can experience a euphoria of flavors, the juices coming from the meat, the cold pico, and they can even spice it up for you. Service here is always quick, plenty of space to sit, the only downside is that the area is a little sketchy, but nothing has happened to me thus far, and I've been coming here for 3-4 years now, so don't be scared to try one of the best burritos you will ever have in your lifetime", "author": "Roy H."}

And then his other homeboy tells me not to worry about him and then attempts at getting my phone number. While he is doing that another one of them ashes his blunt on my foot. So I get up from my chair really irritated and then tell them to f*ck off. Then they start saying more sh*t to me. I start yelling right back, and I'm usually not like that, but I'm tired as hell. When I find another seat, I just blast my music on my Zune really loud. When I get off the bus, we're just cussing at each other, while they're still sitting on the bus. And then one of them throws a water bottle at me. Anyway I get home so irritated. But to my surprise, sitting on the kitchen table are Cinco De Mayo super burritoes and nachos. And with each bite, I forget how about angry I am, and remember that tomorrow is another day. I grew up loving this taqueria since my sister introduced it to me when I was in middle school.
