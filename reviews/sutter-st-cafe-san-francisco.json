I got the Tuna Melt on Sourdough, my boyfriend got the Sutter St Special. I would fly back to San Francisco just for these fckn things. the ingredients are fresh and plentiful and you can choose the time of bun you want it on! They have like 6 different kinds, even lettuce bun.

The impressive thing is that they put together whole hot breakfasts in such a tiny space. We sat at one of three tiny tables in the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered scrambled eggs with hash browns and bacon. Eggs were done right, bacon was thick and well done but not burned. Hash browns, however, were not individual shreds but more like a giant, flat tater tot. We also got a bear claw and a croissant. The bear claw was disappointing--softish dough containing a little blob almond filling--but the croissant was fresh, flaky, and quite good.\n\nMy husband's coffee and my decaf cappuccino were both excellent, and service was friendly.

I know that isn't a particularly compelling reason, but I think it says something that I'm willing to stick around 450 Sutter to get a sandwich when I should be acting more like a bat out of hell after seeing my doctor. It's a relatively modest operation although there are quite a few people who work in this tight space at any given time. It appears to operate as a combination deli and convenience store for those who know it's there - patients, medical office staff, parking lot attendants, lost tourists.\n\nI usually come for the $7.99 Vegan Sandwich, which is well put together with lettuce, tomato, cucumber and artichoke hearts on wheat (photo: http://bit.ly/1meF6fM). I've never asked them what spread they use on the sandwich (i'm guessing a soy-based mayo substitute) but I like it a lot. When I feel a bit more indulgent, I go for their same-priced BLT since they use Applewood Smoked Bacon (photo: http://bit.ly/1QANQKu). These are not culinary creations of the highest order, but they do hit the spot when I need something fast. There are a couple of tables and a small counter if you want to eat in, but it crowds quickly so you may want to reconsider as several regular customers appear to hang out for long periods in here. This may be the Cheers of 450 Sutter.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good sandwiches, well packed\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...definitely feels like a former pharmacy\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...usually prompt though a bit slower the last couple of times\nTOTAL - 4 stars...you can't knock a solid vegan sandwich...even if they don't know my name", "author": "Ed U."}

Pretty good portion and a decent price (about $8ish after tax). While it was very good, it wasn't mind-blowing for a sandwich. It's your average sandwich, slightly better than average for FiDi, and at a slightly better price point. What would make them an amazing sandwich place is if they sauced it up a bit, provided a dill pickle with their sandwiches and served bread that wasn't toast slices but rather something... a little more interesting? Oh, and BTW - the black bean sandwich has got a little bit of spice in it so if you don't like a little spice you may want to stay clear of this one!\n\nThe cafe is nestled inside the 450 Sutter building (turn right after you enter). It's got a cool store of candies and snacks that come from Europe, which came somewhat as a surprise to me. It's a pretty decent selection though and I could see myself purchasing some European snacks the next time I swing by for a bite to eat.\n\nAlso, I don't know if they're just super fast or if I just happened to beat the lunch rush, but I was in around 11:45am and out by 11:50am.

I went there three times, twice for breakfast (the second time bringing three coworkers) and once for a sandwich.\n\nThe cafe, which, somewhat confusingly, is also called the Sutter Street Deli, is under new ownership as of some five months ago. It has a great selection of breakfast items, all made with fresh, and mainly organic, ingredients. On my first visit I had a \"combo\" with egg, cheese and bacon on rye toast, plus \"hash browns\". The combo was serve as a sandwich and was very tasty. I also had Greek yogurt, orange juice and simply wonderful coffee, rich and dark, just the way I like it.\n\nThe next day I returned and had smoked salmon on a bagel, with tomato, onions and capers. (I asked to hold the cream cheese.) As I expected, I got what I call a \"California bagel\", a bagel-shaped dinner roll. I have never found what I consider a real bagel (I'm from the northeast) in California. It was tasty, but not really a bagel. Nevertheless, the ingredients were all delicious. My companions had an omelet and some other egg-and-cheese dishes I don't remember exactly. Everyone loved what they got.\n\nThat afternoon I returned and ordered a sandwich to go and had a cup of gelato in the store. The gelato was very good as was the sandwich when I had it later. They even threw in a Zone bar at no charge.\n\nThe service was very friendly and courteous. The only \"problem\" I can mention is that because everything is prepared to order, and due to limited space they can make only one thing at a time, it can take a while to receive your order if they are busy. It will be worth it, though!\n\nThe cafe also stocks a wide variety of packaged snacks as well as teas, and they have some fresh fruit (I saw bananas and apples) as well.", "author": "Steve L."}

Staff are friendly, the food selection is perfect - not too much, not too little, customizable - there are shelves and shelves of gourmet snacks (and Quest Bars!) and it's inexpensive. The only downside is that because it's in a building, there's only a view of a hallway wall and the parking garage. But for a diner-like breakfast with snacks to go, I'd come back!", "author": "Isha T."}
