Last Saturday at Sorabol, I ordered a veggie bibimbab.  That's right.  Everything I love to have in a rice bowl contains the following slices of prewashed colorful greens: purple lettuce, sprouts, pickled cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, sweet pink ginger, and a couple pieces of broccoli.  Less flavorful, but healthier.  Lots of different colors from vegetables than just shades of brown chunks of meat.\n\nI'm satisfied with the customer service, for I like how the vegetables handled well.  Barley tea is worth 92 cents, while cold water is free.", "author": "Jimmy C."}

After parking we sauntered up to Stonestown's Food Court, where the sign for Korean food caught my attention. Great, I thought... Korean food never disappoints, right?\n\nWrong! I ordered the Salmon Bowl with plenty of enthusiasm, but waitstaff gave no encouragement whatsoever, resorting to my favorite \"nekanlain\" deer-in-headlights look when they're too lazy to look up and see that there is but one person in the line... But I digress.. if that in fact were the only problem.\n\nAfter waiting for nearly ten minutes (without so much as a \"your order will be ready in a few, sir\", I finally got my meal. Salmon itself was ok, but the noodles & rice tasted as if they'd been microwaved, and the broccoli was most certainly frozen beforehand, and not completely cooked at that - I could taste the ice! Come on people....\n\nYes, it's a mall shop. Expectations altered. It should at least be edible, though... next time we return I'll waste my time elsewhere.", "author": "Tim B."}

The mall is usually busy in the food court so don't be surprised if you have to wait to order or for your food to be ready.\nThe food here is good enough for a quick bite. There's nothing special about the food here. I usually only get it if I'm craving it, or if I'm feeling sickish. If I'm feeling sickish, I get the soup. The only thing on the menu that I really like is the vermicelli. Other than that, the food is pretty plain. Not too much flavor in any of the food. You'd think that with the amount of time they make you wait after you order, they'd make it good.\nThe Thai Iced Tea is actually hot tea that they pour over ice. So it's always diluted.

She gives him ONE paper thin napkin.  He asks her if he can have a couple more sheets since there were two of us.  She says pointing at me, \"no, she can get napkins from the place she got her food from.\" I proceed to say, \"actually he just paid for my food that is on that tray, so technically I did get food from here too.\"  She just continues to tell me to get my napkins at the other restaurant.  Then, my friend says that the one napkin wouldn't even be enough for him because it's really thin. But, of course she didn't budge and said we could not get anymore napkins.  \n\nI was livid that I told her that I didn't want my food that he just literally just paid for and obviously didn't touch, but she said we couldn't get our money back.  WTH!  We paid for food, but because ALL of our food isn't from your restaurant you want us to get necessary items to eat from another establishment.  Talk about stingy and unacceptable customer service!!!!!!!  So, since we couldn't get more napkins, we took about 4 more pieces of plastic forks & knives that was set in front of her for customers to take.  Hmmm....what's more expensive more plastic or a couple more pieces of paper thin napkins? I know childish thing to do, but we wanted to make a point. Maybe use it as a trade tactic....we'll put back the forks if you give us napkins? LOL. \n\nIt's been years since I've eaten at any Sorabol because it doesn't deserve a penny from me.

I thought that maybe things (read: portion sizes) may have changed. Wouldn't have believed that portion sizes could be worse but sadly and astonishingly, they were. It's like they discovered what the correct portion size for carbs should be (your fist) and decided to reduce that by half. C'mon people, you serve Asian food and that usually means more than half a fist of rice. Server and cashier were not friendly and obviously didn't get the \"10 Ways to Great Customer Service\" handbook. Place was so apathetic, it made me wonder if they wanted to get closed down by Corporate Sorabol, if such an entity exists. So sorry to see a once-great Korean fast food place sink to such depths.", "author": "Lulu H."}

It more of an alternative to Panda Express and Tokyo Express and still Eastern. I asked for no rice and the lady listened and the hot sauce is spicy and sweet but not sriracha!  The pickled veggies and the sauted vermicelli were delicious!  My veggie bowl with vermicelli noodles and tofu stir fry came out to less than $10 which is really comparable to Panda Express.", "author": "R C."}

Great Steak Escape (or whatever it's called) use to be on the list, but in a half-assed attempt at trying to eat healthier, I rarely go here. And I use to go to Boudin's with my sister, but that tradition went out when my sister stopped working weekends.\n\nSorabol isn't that bad. I've never really had bad customer service... none that I can remember... and the lines are pretty fast, if you don't have an old person gum it up and try to decide what they want while they're ordering and not letting you go on ahead. Fuckers.\n\nI kinda find it funny that they cut the meat with scissors. I mean, I guess it's sanitary if they only use those scissors for cutting meat and not for cutting out coupons.\n\nThe two items I usually get here are the BBQ Chicken rice and noodle bowl or the Spicy Pork rice and noodle bowl. I once got the unagi rice and noodle bowl, since I really love unagi, but that took forever so I only get my eel craving fix at Tokyo Express... or if I'm elsewhere... elsewhere. And with that, I've never found the food to be bad. It's not the best, of course, but it doesn't make me sick.\n\nI still come here when I'm not in the mood for a salad or panini or sushi, so I can't say anything totally bad about this place. It's okay, especially if you want rice and don't go to Panda Express like me.", "author": "Chris S."}

I usually get the BBQ chicken with rice, clear noodles, and veggies. I had it most recently last Saturday. For $7.25 + tax, it was on the higher side of mall food court pricing as I was shying away from my saturation of Panda Express over the years. The BBQ chicken is cut with scissors and not even a plastic knife is provided. I guess it just doesn't occur to them that customers will still need it after the 5 second cuts the scissor makes. I wish kimchi was included, it doesn't feel like a Korean meal without it. Food temperature was barely warm and the veggies were pretty solid. I hate mushrooms and the clear noodles just happened to have them. The noodles were much better than before though, I'll give them that.", "author": "Dominic T."}

They also are pretty skimpy with their servings. Once I ordered a BBQ chicken plate and I asked the lady to give me an extra serving of rice instead of the veggies. She said OK and turned slightly and just scooped part of the rice that I already had in the container into the part where the veggies were supposed to go. You would think that they would have been happy to replace the veggies being that the rice is a cheaper item.

As we are sitting nearby eating the soup, I notice a sign on their counter advertising ramen soup, available in mild or spicy! (grrrr)  When we checked out, the lady behind the counter was asking me if I had a stroller for my 2-year-old (I guess she was concerned that my kid was running around).  I think she ought to be less concerned about that, and a little more familiar with her own establishment's menu.  I was pretty irritated when I read that they did in fact have *exactly* what we wanted to order on the menu!  My four-year-old was very unhappy, because she didn't like the soup the lady sold us (because it wasn't ramen noodles, and also not a very flavorful broth -- it was edible for me, but a would say a bit bland/watery).
