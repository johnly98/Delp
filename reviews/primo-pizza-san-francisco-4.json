{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-10", "description": "Before shedding light on the horrible service that they are so great at, I would like to say that I have lived in the neighborhood for nearly ten years and I was very much a fan when they opened a few years back. The staff was friendly and the food was good, everything you'd expect from a neighborhood pizza joint and since I'm an advocate for supporting neighborhood/local businesses you could find me there weekly. It was when the evening staff had changed a while back that I started to notice some serious changes in service. Not sure if that was the reason, I can only assume. If you care to learn the dirty little details read on. Short if it is horrible service and mediocre food. The long narrative is in hopes that the owners will read this and do something about it.\n\nThey market that they're open late, midnight on the weekdays and 3am on weekends (according to friends and neighbors, this is likely the only reason they're still in business at all). At exactly 11:12pm I ordered a pizza and milkshake (don't judge). The man who answered the phone said that the milkshake machine was \"down\". This wasn't surprising as for the past year or so, anytime I ordered a shake later in the evening it was either \"down\" or they \"ran out of ice cream\" or some silly excuse covering the fact that they shut it down early and weren't going to clean it again. Fine, pizza it is. He then tells me that they're not delivering this late either. I said that I've ordered there plenty of times this same time of night and it's never been a problem before, to which he has a long winded excuse as to why they just couldn't tonight ending with \"sorry, you'll have to pick it up\". Fine, it's a block away, I'll come pick it up. He calls me back at 11:36pm to tell me that I need to come and pick up my pizza now cause they're going to close in five minutes. Now, I'm a 40yr self employed professional and having orders barked at me has never been easy to swallow, not to mention I'm very aware that they're open till midnight. I asked if their hours have changed and he confirmed they hadn't. I told him I was on my way and would be there in a minute. Before I get my second shoe on, another call from Primo; a younger more aggressive person telling me I need to come and get my food now. When asked for his manager, the original man who called before gets back on the phone and just confirmed that he would cancel my order if I wasn't there soon. I then asked for the name of the store manager and/or owner, to which I got some very muffled responses and only after repeatedly asking for the name did I get an official \"Dave\"! When I asked for his name I got some more muffled responses and after asking three times he barks \"Tommy\" (due to his strong Indian accent, I highly doubt this was his name). I asked for the name of the young man who passed the phone to him and he hands the phone over to someone (assuming the younger guy) and I hear \"he wants your name\" right before the phone hangs up! Service at it's finest, right? \n\nAs a business owner I pride myself on stellar customer service and also expect it from businesses that I support. I don't have high standards for a neighborhood pizza joint but they took a minimal expectation, and stomped it out with the hanging up of their phone. To the owners of the SF location of Primo Pizza, you might want to cross reference any drops in revenue/sales with the hire dates of your employees; I'm sure there'd be a connection. As for me, no need to send me any coupons. I won't be returning.", "author": "Ryan A."}

The pizza is your standard pizza fare, but the dough, sauce and freshness of the ingredients deserve to be singled out. To put it better, it's the best of the classic style neighborhood pizza delivery places, in terms of quality.\n\nMy first pizzas arrived quick and hot! I now had an old school pizza place to provide contrast with all the artisanal places.\n\nBut about a month or two later, the pizzas started arriving super slow, like everyone is saying. It is absolutely cold, guaranteed, and you will have to heat it up first. I live 4 blocks away! The pizza arriving cold is a bummer, and as a result, walking to Little Star for takeout is now more appealing, because my dinner will be warm. If it's taking 70-90 minutes to get my pizza 4 blocks away, I can't imagine how long it takes if you're further than I.\n\nIf they want to be the old school pizzeria, they must get the pizza out the door hot and fast. I feel like maybe the ownership isn't supervising the employees at the SF store. Or maybe they are having staffing trouble, too, because the last guy to deliver had an apron on like he was the cook, and he tried to give me a free 2-liter coke as apology for the delay. Maybe they need to buy some sleeves or ovens for the drivers, I don't know.\n\nIt takes someone in the restaurant really giving a damn about keeping customers happy to make a pizza place work. I speak from my young years, working in a pizza restaurant. I hope that changes. The pizza is delicious, but nobody wants to wait all night for cold pizza!\n\nUpdate 3/7.

I ordered chicken strips, a slice of cheesecake, and a chocolate milkshake for my friend. \n\nFast forward two hours, when the food finally decided to arrive. Yes, it took them 2 hours to deliver my order. I didn't order anything complicated, not to mention the fact that I live 3 miles away from Primo. \n\nThe chicken strips were overcooked, the cheesecake was pre-packaged (yes, in a plastic sleeve....imagine if Hostess made cheesecake), and the milkshake was melted and thin. \n\nI would rather spend double the amount of money than to ever order from this place again. They took forever, and the food was nowhere near being worth the wait.", "author": "Lily K."}

The problem was that it took 35 minutes to get the food. They have no concept of time. It was lunch hour and there was nobody there that should give them a clue. I get that it is a mom and pop but if they want to stay in business they have to do the basics. One person needs to take the orders and work the cash register and let the cook make the sandwiches and the cook can't wander off halfway through making it. There was a third person working there but they came out of the back and just left during the time I was there. It doesn't matter how good the food is if you can't serve it in a timely fashion.", "author": "Lewis Z."}

Tomato paste is the only thing in the food pyramid that I will not touch with a 10 foot pole. I have a bad history with tomato paste and get BBQ pizza specifically because they use BBQ sauce instead of tomato paste. There was no tomato paste in the ingredients list. I have never ordered a BBQ pizza from somewhere where they put tomato paste AND BBQ sauce on a pizza at the same time. Not only is that a ridiculous combination but it literally ruined my entire night because Eat24 usually makes me really happy. That is all. \n\nThe worst thing is this pizza also is not cheap. I would have given it another star if maybe the pizza was less expensive/made better. I wish I had a Dominos that would deliver because their automated pizza making process is sooo much tastier and much cheaper.

I had such high hopes for the new neighborhood slice joint. In fact,  I've been holding off reviewing this place because I actually wanted to see them succeed when they opened. Unfortunately,  this place has devolved into an EPIC FAIL and a complete AFFRONT to pizza lovers everywhere. I'll break down the utter tragedy that is Primos Pizza in two digestible (unlike their ungodly pizza) parts and I won't even charge them my consulting fees for the analysis of their pathetic excuse for a customer reliant business.\n\n\nTHE STAFF: Are A) RUDE to locals when THEY are the newcomers to OUR neighborhood. B) So glacially slow you wonder if every one of them is severely mentally challenged. Hint: food service is about speed, quality, and precision. C) So unprofessional they do things like smoke in front of the restaurant with the door wide open and smoke wafting inside, taking a phone order while in the middle of a face to face order with the customer in front of your face holding cash. D) INCAPABLE of displaying basic human communication skills  like saying \"Hello.\" or \"welcome!\" or \"Thank You for your business!\" Or \"Please come again!\" They're often just plain cold, unresponsive, and mean. Their attitude says \"FU for interrupting my Judge Judy session!\" And that's not a stretch because the TV isn't mounted on the east or south wall where customers could most likely enjoy it. No, it's mounted high on the NORTH wall so the employees can sit around and mindlessly watch it like a bunch of useless convalescents and ignore their most important responsibility- the CUSTOMERS.\n\nThe Pizza: You guys DO know that you're competing against an Little Star which is a neighborhood INSTITUTION and one of if not THE BEST pizza in San Francisco right? You can't be THAT clueless! I know Primo's is not in the same lane, hell, Primo's is not even on the same planet! If pizza was represented in our solar system, Little Star would be the sun and Primo's would be a piece of space garbage.  The pizza dough HAS SO. MUCH. YEAST! Their slice would literally kill an elephant with celiacs disease it's so doughy, AND it's often UNDERCOOKED. The ingredients are cheap. The sauce is bland, the amount of cheese piled on is just excessive. It's basically horrible mixerMozzarella cheese bread. If you like this place you have no idea what a good pizza tastes like or what good customer experience should feel like.\n\nI really wanted to love you Primo's. I was the only person on our street sticking up for you when all of my neighbors said you were garbage. I was like a battered wife that kept going back for more anytime I was too lazy to get some real food or so hammered that you were my food booty call, because that's all you're good for. But! My last experience was just that and I'm not coming back for your abuse ever again. I wouldn't pee on you if you were on fire, I'd use your flame to light my pre roll and celebrate your demise with my neighbors. I hope that you had the basic curiosity to research why the businesses before you failed. I doubt you did since NONE of your staff seems to posses ANY sort of basic work skills the only thing about them that's basic is THEM. Here's the answer to why the businesses in that same space before you inevitably failed and why you will too: They alienated their customers thereby alienating their own community. Exactly what you guys have managed to do. Great work.", "author": "SF M."}

If you're going to make crappy pizza at least make it cheaper than everywhere else.\n\nAlso, they add toppings to already cooked cheese slices when you order a combo/topping. And then add a ton more cheese on top. You end up with overcooked pizza with undercooked toppings and cheese. It's gross. \n\nAgain, why is it so hard to make a decent pizza slice in SF? There are a lot of good pizza restaurants...but places to get a good slice in this city are few and far between.

It's small, it's new and the employees there, I can count with one hand. What that means is that on any given day, you may have 1-2 employees tops handling deliveries, which goes along with the negative reviews that the food takes forever to be delivered.\n\nThat being said, I literally live down the street from this place and have never had to get my food delivered, so I only have great things to say about Primo Pizza.\nI've always been a big fan of pizza, especially when they offer them by the slice; what's even better is the fact that since this place open they offer two slices of pizza with 2 toppings and a fountain drink, all for $6.50. Add to that the fact that they have a HUGE selection of toppings and you can pretty much create any kind of pizza you want. \n\nIn terms of what I usually order, it's pretty straightforward; I usually get pepperoni and sausage, BBQ chicken or Hawaiian (pineapple and Canadian bacon) and so far, I haven't been disappointed. The slices are above average in size, the amount of toppings you get and quite sizable and I've never had to wait longer than 10-15 mins for my order to be ready. \n\nI don't really venture out too much, I go to pizza joints for pizza so I haven't tried anything else on the menu, but if you're close by and you're looking for good, cheap pizza with a bunch of varied toppings to put on it, you are definitely going to enjoy Primo Pizza!", "author": "Jonathan P."}

One is probably not going to take a prospective girlfriend/boyfriend to Primo on a first-time date with her/him; its fare and ambience are quite prosaic, but in realm of food establishments, this is a good thing with the preponderance of restaurants in San Francisco more than willing to sell you, say a hamburger with a slice of blood orange topped upon it, for $30. There is a clear need for food establishments like Primo whose basic goal is to provide a meal or a late-night snack cheaply and efficiently, and in my opinion, Primo does this well. My most recent visit to Primo saw me enjoying a small (10 in.), thin-crust pizza topped with pineapple.

I'm a people watcher so I began watching the cook. he began walking around the back looking for ingredients. I was surprised in the bad way. the cook didn't seem to know where all the ingredients were. about 10 minutes went by before the cook finally grabbed the soft roll. periodically the cook would disappear to the back for a few minutes. 15 minutes into the order he finally put the cheese on the bread and began constructing the sammich. in walked in a gentleman who ordered two slices. so the cook froze on my sammich and began putting together the slices. so my sammich just sat there. in walked in 2 other gentleman. one guy was an obvious employer and another guy was either a delivery driver or maybe an IT guy because they both picked up a phone and all began looking at it. the two new guys and the cook began looking at the phone together. the slices were in the oven. sammich still sitting there half made. 20 minutes into it the cook finally got my order in the oven. so now i sat sitting watching the cook and two guys continue looking at the phone. looked like they were not agreeing on whatever was on that screen. the girl behind the counter had only taken my sammich order and the 2 slice order. the pizza was ready and she walked over to the big old fat guy and said, \"did you order the sammich or the slices?\" as if they were slammed with orders. long story short. the cook was too busy trying to figure out whatever was on that phone that he forgot about my sammich. 40 minutes into it the cashier girl pulled my sammich out and wrapped it up. I later enjoyed the sammich. it was a tasty one. the pepperoncini peppers and the jalapenos gave it a zing. the soft roll was crispy on the out and just soggy enoigh on the inside. the cheddar cheese was sharp. the last 1/4 of the sammich ran out of chicken. but besides that. a 4 out of 5 stars on it. if your are looking for a quick sammich. not the place. this place is a pizza joint.

Order takeout or go elsewhere. Set up for delivery. Eating in an afterthought and once you've paid... Prepare to wait.", "author": "Visit T."}

When they put up all the cheesy lights and signs, I thought that maybe, since its right next to the hood, it would just be super cheap blah food, but outside of their 2-slices-and-a-soda deal, it's not even that cheap. Definitely not worth it, no matter the price. I'm sad that the space wasn't turned into something cooler. Please close your business and let someone else make our neighborhood a better place.", "author": "Andy W."}
