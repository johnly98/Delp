Unexpected ingredients are one of my least favorite things.\n\nStill a delicious burrito that was 90% what was expected. Good enough to be four stars if the $8 price wasn't a special.

So I'm gonna assume the beans are more expensive than the rice. . . but got charged $1.25 for the extra rice even though I'm missing the beans???  And it doesn't show up on the receipt as a separate charge-had to ask for an explanation why the burrito was more expensive than the listed price!    \n\nIt's not that great of a burrito either-the meat has no flavor, the rice is bland and they wrap the burrito so tight there's a double layer of tortilla around half the burrito!  Looks big, but isn't what it seems to be.  And where's the salsa fresca?  Was it that little bit of small diced tomato and maybe a bell pepper or jalapeno or something before the last bite? If you're subbing rice for beans, shouldn't I get the same amount of everything else and add a bit extra rice for the equivalent of the beans?  Total ripoff, and they don't serve what they describe on the menu.\n\nAmigo, you gotta do something to generate some good PR at your place cuz your burrito ain't worth $10!  Any other burrito shop I've gone to doesn't charge extra for rice that's substituted for beans and they're burritos are much better than yours.\n\nEsto no es bueno para los negocios!!!", "author": "Joeblow L."}

Went to check it out and had a BAAAAAAAD experience. I normally eat vegetarian but will get seafood on occasion, usually if I'm someplace fancy or if nothing else on the menu looks good. The veggie burrito had \"steamed squash and mushrooms\" which often means they heat up frozen veggies in a microwave and throw them in a burrito (not sure if that's the case here or not) so I opted for the Shrimp Burrito. It didn't come with guac or sour cream so I added those which made it, like $10. That was kinda lame but wouldn't necessarily deter me from coming back. \n\nGot halfway through the burrito, it was OK, nothing special but not bad. Then I took a bite of something tough... I pulled a six inch piece of plastic out of my mouth. EW!!! I took it up to the counter and the guy apologized and I asked for a refund. He thought for a minute and said \"yeeeaaahh\" begrudgingly. He asked what I had and then asked to see the burrito. I showed it to him and he said that it was $9 (no!) and I ate half so he would only give me $4. NOT OK!

I went in maybe a week or two after they first opened the doors, and let me tell you... I haven't been this disappointed in a burrito, or my food in a very long time. It was so bad, I threw out more than half of the burrito after having a few bites.\n\nI ordered a carne asada burrito (I mean, you can't go wrong with carne asada, right? Who could screw that up? Pffft). It came with a side of chips and salsa. The salsa had a weird chemical-ish taste to it, I couldn't pinpoint it but it tasted really weird. The chips were bagged, store bought chips, nothing special. The ingredients: Not fresh. They had the food ready, and the guy in the back would put the ingredients inside the tortilla and BAM (in 3 mins or less you get your nice, cold burrito). The carne asada was very bland. It tasted as if it were boiled, season, then thrown on a grill to sear for a little just to make it appear as if it were grilled or even cooked over a fire stove. I don't know!!! It pains me to even describe it. I think the only decent thing in my burrito was the small slices on guacamole. Eventually, I ended up dissecting my burrito. I opened it up and just slowly inspected everything. I was so disappointed. It was a sad day. It was a sad lunch. \n\nI know Burrito Loco is a new establishment and there's definitely a lot of room for improvement. Hopefully the can take some of our reviews into consideration to help with the business. I mean, I'm not writing this to bash on the business because I wanted to like this place. Seriously!

I gave a -1 star due to not keeping their tables outside cleared.  Customer came in and had to bus someone elses dirty dishes to sit outside with her family...YUK! Our burrito was to go, and it was prepared with 10min.  Stop by and check out their menu, I think they have a good thing going and its just a matter of time till they get some of the new kinks worked out.", "author": "J G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-24", "description": "I really want this place to succeed. Mexican food is my comfort food, on par with meaty lasagna. I hope they are listening and taking notes. The flavor really wasn't on the food. I have had a number of items including a wet burrito, super burrito, enchiladas, tacos, and nachos. There seems to be a lack of salt and/or flavoring. The carnitas super burrito was pretty good though, mostly because of the natural saltiness I suspect. I do not like their chips though, they seem store bought and really thin and light. The red sauce for the mojado/wet burrito was not very flavorful. The nachos did not have enough cheese. The tacos fell apart in 5 minutes due to being too soft and mushy. The enchiladas were better, but still lacked the flavor bang. They do not need to give two different salsas per order, that just wastes money, I think. Not sure if there is room for a salsa bar, but ask the customer if they want one or the other, or both. One star each for good prices and friendly service.", "author": "Wilfred B."}
