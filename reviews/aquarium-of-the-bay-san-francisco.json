They even had an area where you could walk through a large tank that arched over your head. By far my favorite part of the aquarium was the jelly fish room. They had multiple large tanks with a variety of species. They were lit with changing lights that gave the jelly fish an otherworldly feel. \nMy second favorite part of the museum was the otter habitat.

It has 2 levels but due to it's size, you really don't get to see much. \nThey have an under water tunnel that's pretty cool but not a lot of interesting fish to hold your attention unfortunately. The sea otters were no where in sight so that was quite disappointing.\nThe price for the aquarium is pretty steep ($75 for 2 adults and 1 kid) considering you can only spend 30-45 min in there and that's going pretty slow.", "author": "Janet Y."}

My daughter was set on seeing the Otters which is last but the best part is, you can walk thru over and over as much as you want all day long. Our 1st trip thru we were with so many other people it was hard to obsorb and to get the little kids up front to see stuff (which is why I gave 4 and not the full 5 stars, would be nice if they only let a certain amount in at a time) but our 2nd trip thru was much better and we truly enjoyed every single exhibit and got to stand in the tunnel while scuba divers swam thru cleaning and feeding. So fun!!\nI highly recommend this aquarium, we spent 2 and a half hours with 3 kids (ages 7, 4 and 2) but if you want to go faster you can. Everything was beautiful and set up nicely to keep their interest, we probably would have went thru the tunnel and stopped at the otters again if we didnt have a party to host back home.\nAlso, the little shops were great, the front one has better options for kids!!", "author": "Caitlin D."}

You can get a local resident discount for less than $23 with your id or it's about $27 for general admission. You get in and out privileges for the whole day on case you wanted to come back for a show/timed event.\n\nI think what makes this aquarium different than the others I've been to in California is the tunnel that you can walk through and see fish from all angles. They have a decent variety of sharks, rays, starfish, and other fish. The jellyfish exhibit was very pretty cool but again, not as diverse as Monterey. There were even pools of starfish and stingrays that you can touch along with a small otter exhibit.\n\nOverall, I'd rather go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium instead but this is a place to visit at least once if you're in the area or from the bay area.", "author": "Steph F."}

Perfect for younger kids, priced accordingly, and let's you go explore either the rest of pier 39, and or other parts of San Francisco to fill your day. A friend of mine and I brought our daughters here after getting discounted tickets (even more worth it). They had a great time seeing the rays and sharks swim all around them as we went down the moving walkway, they loved petting the Rays in the Ray pool, touching and playing with creatures in the tide pool and really loved the screen where it looks like you are interacting with a bunch of other animals. Afterwards we went and played on pier 39, trampoline, merry go round, watched sea lions, ate lunch, caught a trolly car and explored other parts of San Francisco. We had a fabulous day and this was the perfect jumping point!  Also, you learn a lot about local sea life, which is different than most aquariums.", "author": "Charles R."}

His favorite attraction is the touch pool. I was most impressed by the tunnel and the amount and diversity of sea life that can be viewed. I thought pricing was reasonable for the smaller (as compared to a Monterey Bay Aquarium size) venue. I am removing one star because of the bottlenecks created at the elevators and crowds that form at either side of them. If you are severely claustrophobic you definitely don't want to visit. A child pressed the \"stop walkway\" button which sounded a bell. This really upset a young woman who was waiting for the elevator who became frantic.

This isn't a bad aquarium by any stretch, just take it slow and maybe make a few passes. The aquarium is three floors, floor one is more educational than anything, not a whole lot to take in. The second floor is the winner of the aquarium, it's the part where you go underneath the exhibit and the fish are swimming all around you. It really was quite fun! I was amazed by how dirty the aquarium appeared, I'm sure kids touch the glass all day but there were hand prints EVERYWHERE, including the very top of the tunnel which you can't reach if you're under 5'10. The third floor is the tide pools and the otter exhibit which is all very good fun, I could watch the otters for hours. \n\nWe made two or three passes of the tunnel area and hung out by the otters for a while, we spent two hours in there which really wasn't bad. Just try and go slow, spend as much time as you can observing things.

They also have 2 strategically placed stores in the beginning of the aquarium and on the way out that you have to walk thru to get in and out. Lol but they have cute things and you get to see your pictures from the photo op area they have in the beginning of the aquarium as well. I think this is something we will do again. It was reasonably priced and right on the pier so there a lot of food and other attractions close by. Look for coupon codes for money off tickets! That's what we did!

Not the biggest or most robust aquarium, but definitely a fun several hours for all!\n\nThey allow you to leave and return the same day, nice for when you want to take a break for lunch and come back rejuvenated.

Finally, via the elevator, they return to level 3, where there are few more exhibits such as \"Touch the Bay\" and the river otters.\nThere is no \"main hall\" to this aquarium, just three passageways separated by the elevator.  The walkthrough of the entire aquarium ends as quickly as it has begun so enjoy while it lasts!  Plus, young children will especially enjoy the \"Touch the Bay\" exhibit as they get to lay their hands on the living creatures.\nThe main highlight of my visit was walking through the tunnels, as various sea creatures of swam along and above me as I walked through.  I thought the river otters were highly adorable.  Sadly, my tour through the aquarium ended in less than half an hour.  Prior to the tunnels, I got a cameraman to snap photos of me to highlight my visit; however, when I reached the gift shop to purchase the photos, the clerk told me that I can only obtain hard copies, not digital copies.\nFor a better aquarium in San Francisco, I would suggest the one in California Academy of Sciences in Golden Gate Park.", "author": "Akisato S."}

The family had been to Steinhart twice this year so we decided to go to the touristy stuff while we hit \"Aquarium Of The Bay\".  We also hit Ghirardelli Square for a sundae - it's a must.\n\nSo... it's pretty small but I would say worth it for the $50 I spent for my two kids and the parental units (myself included).  The several hundred foot long tunnel aquarium was fantastic and is easily the star of the show.  The surprise was the otter exhibit which while we were there had the otters racing around their glassed enclosure like they had just been fed Ritalin stopping intermittently to engage the small children with their faces pressed up on the glass.\n\nSteinhart is the classic aquarium so go there if you want several hours of time to spend but it will be nearly twice as much (love the place) and if you want to go to the Monterey Bay Aquarium it's about 90 minutes drive and thrice the price.  \n\nIf your a tourist, just drop the cash and do it already.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-10-16", "description": "Warning: Long, educational review to follow! This is a great educational and relaxing place that the whole family will enjoy. \n\nWe entered through the gift shop, immediately going to a few exhibits in cylinders and tanks against the walls. One of those exhibits was the \"Trash Tank,\" where they show what happens when people throw their trash in the ocean. There was a decorator crab in there, so named because they camouflage themselves by decorating their shells with items from the environment. And speaking of \"shells,\" the decorator crab doesn't really have one. It's more like a spider or snake that outgrows its skin, then sheds the \"shell,\" and its outer skin starts hardening up again. Once the skin gets too hard and inhibits growth, the process starts again. Cool! \n\nOnce through the tanks room, you go down the elevator to the jellyfish displays. I learned many things from the employees: the very fine, thread-like appendages are stingers and for protection only; the shorter, more gloppy limbs are actual arms that the jellyfish uses to eat. If you can't see the gloppy arms, that means it's eating. Also, if you see through a jellyfish, there are four circles, like on a sand dollar. These are four stomachs, and when you see colored rings around them, you are seeing its digested food. Awesome. \n\nOn into the tunnels. These tunnels have both a moving sidewalk and a standing/walking part; I'd recommend walking through and going at your own pace, though if you come too late they'll be turned off. The first tunnel contains the native bay fish and real bay water, part fresh, part salt, but it's filtered so it's less murky and you can see through it. Lots of starfish populate this area, which, like jellyfish, have thicker, stringy folds in their centers. In the sea stars, as they call them now, these are mouth and anus parts; the food goes in and out the same spot. If you can't see strings in the center, the sea star/starfish is content. \n\nThe second tunnel contains more deeper, saltwater fish. The ones that look like catfish with \"whiskers\" are actually sturgeon, and those \"whiskers\" are growths called barbels. Catfish and sturgeon are not related. I didn't get to explore this second tunnel much, since I had to meet my ferry, but I'd recommend checking out the different rock fish and watching the schools swim by. \n\nBack up the double-sided elevator and out the back this time. There's a tidepool to touch sting rays, sea stars, and other fish (only with one finger), as well as jumping seals to get your picture taken next to. Don't forget souvineers on your way out. \n\nVery educational. Go and enjoy a few hours to really see everything.", "author": "Audra S."}

By no means is it like Monterey Bay, but it is still very fun and great for little kids. They have an opening section where it is mostly a petting area so kids can see a lot of critters more up close and personal. However, my favorite part was the tunnel. You walk through a tunnel that has hundreds of fish, sharks, and more and there is an employee there that can answer most any questions you have about the wildlife. Also, the otter section was really cool to see.\n\nIt's conveniently located just off of Fisherman's Wharf. So if you have some extra time to kill, want to experience as much of SF as possible, this could be a good stop for you. It is also a pier or two (so a block or two) away from Alcatraz and the Saturday Farmer's Trade Market. \n\nI would recommend buying tickets here in a package, it makes it more cost effective. Otherwise, I am not sure the $30 bucks is necessarily worth it for the size of the aquarium (though it is very well maintained and is still a neat experience). I am a baller on a budget, so I really try to have the most bang for my buck. We had military discount, so it helped a bit. \n\n3 stars because I've had better for my money, but honestly it is on the verge of 4 stars because it is pretty cool.

For you aquarium connoisseurs, you're missing out if you don't stop by this place. I think I came here for the first time after I left the bay area which is a pity because this is probably my second favorite aquarium here in California. Yes it is located on the pier and you think from all their advertisements that it's just a tourist trap but it's a good one! \n\nIf you parked at the Pier 39 garage you get $2 off a general adult ticket so be sure to use it. You take an escalator upstairs and prepare for a several level experience of all the bay's sea creatures. You start off with some of the more tropical fish that you don't get too much here in California but as you go deeper and deeper you'll see displays of jellyfish, kelp forest fish and many others. Take a trip downstairs and your adventure continues with more local fish and then the shark tunnel.\n\nEven the shark tunnel features fish from the local area including the 7 gill shark which is the largest shark that is endemic to the area. Yes, there are great whites too in SF bay but not all that common. They had large sturgeons, rays and guitarfish which are always fun to see. Your trip ends with a lot of reptile and amphibian displays followed by 3 playful male otters that are a hoot.\n\nPark at Pier 39 for all your Fisherman's Wharf shenanigans. While the price is initially startling, your discounts make up for it and also the headache of trying to find somewhere cheaper to park would offset it as well.", "author": "Eric C."}

We left before the feature on the lizard upstairs.\n\nThey have two small tide pools where you can touch stuff like starfish, but these are pretty popular with the children. They have paper towels to dry off next to the pools, which is nice.\n\nI loved the otter exhibit -- so cute! I wish it was a bit larger, or that we had caught the otters when they were more active.

The bottom floor is unimpressive and unkept, the tunnels were very dark and murky. Additionally, the children were screaming and yelling. I had a headache when I left. The upper level has two touch pools with sting rays and starfish. The girl who works at the touch pool has a microphone that she used A LOT to remind people to \"only touch the edges\" of the string rays. Many adults were not watching their children at the touch pools, which was making the microphone girl mad. Additionally, there is a rock wall that is labeled with a sign that says, \" do not climb on wall.\" There were families just watching as their children climbed on the wall to look into the touch pool with the sea stars.  A couple of the animals in this room were removed from their exhibits. The otters were so sad. I felt bad for them to be in such a tiny exhibit. The aquarium employee said the otters were napping and that they were more active when they were being fed. She said we could come back with our tickets later to see if they were more active. \n\nOverall, if you like screaming children and absolute chaos, this is the place for you! \n\nI wish I could get my money back.

The aquarium is nice but there aren't many exhibits.  The highlights are two large tunnels that you can walk through and see he fish from an unusual view point (like you are inside their tank).  The rays seem to like to swim over the tunnel glass so you get a close up view of their underside.  It is fun but I don't think this meets the bar as a destination place.  I'd recommend this place if you are already visiting Pier 39.\n\nIn addition to the aquarium, I signed up for the 'Feed the shark' event which happens only on certain days and times so check their website to make reservations (only 5 guests per feeding).  It's much more than the act of feeding the sharks which is really just throwing some squid into the big tank.  You get a behind the scenes look at the aquarium with a private guide (1 guide to 5 guests) so you can ask all the questions you want about the fish or the aquarium.  I found it very educational and very interesting to see the facilities, to learn how their water filtration works, learn about their feeding, and see the quarantine areas.  If you add in this event, then I think the aquarium is worth the trip out.\n\nAquarium only: 3 stars\nFeed the sharks: 4 stars", "author": "Lily L."}

When you enter there are a few tanks with things like small fish, frogs, and other non exciting sea creatures. At first my husband and I thought that was it and we were about to be pissed - surely there's more! We weren't  given any direction, so we asked an employee where we could find more exhibits.

Of course the aquarium was full of kids, but it wasn't overly crowded which was nice. We were still able to get up to each of the tanks. \n\nThe best part by far was the tunnel.

I feel bad that I have to compare it to the Academy's Nightlife nights, but the Bay was really lacking in excitement. It was much smaller than I had anticipated. It also feels very outdated.  I feel major updates are needed with the prices they're charging.\n\nWhat I liked was the shark tunnel and the octopus (though it seems strange that the tank is well-lit?). There was a stingray petting pool and a little place for sea otters. \n\nThe flashing headphones they gave us as part of Aquapalooza were staticky and went in and out of signal (occasionally blaring Katy Perry).

I am in love with animals and everything to do with the ocean, and we were done in 40 minutes.  Other aquariums have me there for hours or even a full day.\n\nIt's two stories but that is misleading as this is pretty small for an aquarium.  The tunnel with glass overhead and on the sides with fish everywhere was really cool.\n\nIt was also great to see the baby mana rays.  They swam right over to us.  One even came halfway out of the water to see me!  The employee told us that they like to be caressed on the top end of their fins. We tried that out, and that was a really cool experience.\n\nThere are employees in every corner who just jump into conversations and when they overhear you discussing an animal or display with a question, they pipe in with the answer like a ninja. It was a bit annoying because my friend and I were discussing amongst ourselves, and if we really wanted to know something we would have either looked it up on my phone or asked someone.  However, I'm sure other customers really appreciate that kind of thing. \n\nThe river otters weren't around when we were there.  There was a big note at the display that it was closed.  It would've been better to have put a notice out at the front of the aquarium stating this.  \n\nAt the end of the displays, you have made a circle and end up in the souvenir shop just before going outside.  They try to get you to buy pictures that they imposed you to take.  I had told the photographer I had no interest in paying for some goofy picture from them, but he kept talking over me and wouldn't listen so I gave up to get away from him.  In the souvenir shop, when the cashier yelled over to us to check out our pictures - we were 20 ft. away - I walked over to her and said no thanks.  Her co-worker laughed, and the cashier then started complaining about how no one wants their pictures and she's tired of printing them out.

It would have been helpful to have the same fish information on both sides too. I wish the information about the awful practice of shark fining, which is now illegal in California was bigger to catch more attention. It looks like there was some sort of conveyor belt to guide people along under the tanks, but it was not operational.\n\nI didn't care for the fake kelp throughout the tanks and the some of the display kiosks need more love. At least they are trying to promote conservation and work to save the octopuses from fishermen killing them.

This pales in comparison to larger aquariums. It is quite small and actually has very little to look at. They could completely rebrand it as the under the bay experience as that (walking through the tunnel in a 70,000 gallon SF Bay simulation) is pretty much all there is to do there.\n\nThe Aquarium of the Bay focuses on the biodiversity of the San Francisco Bay and has a strong conservation message which I love.\n\nHere are some of the reasons why I gave it a 3-star review:\n*Admission is high for what it is. This aquarium is about a 1 hour experience. The adult admission fee is over $20. I know that the money goes to do great work, but seems a little high for the amount of attraction available.\n\n*Educational Signage. This was a huge miss for me. I found myself wanting to know more about the species on display. in the underwater tubes, there is very little information about the species of fish and there aren't enough guides around to get information from. This was particularly frustrating in the jellyfish exhibit where I was mesmerized but wish I knew more about the species on display.\n\nYou will be delighted at the touch pond. Here you can touch species of ray, skate and shark. Interestingly enough, you can only touch the species with one finger and can not feed the ray. (At other aquariums you are allowed to feed the rays)\n\nThere is a second touch pond where you can touch sea cucumbers, anemones and starfish. Truly amazing.\n\nDo not miss the playful and adorable river otters!", "author": "Daniel M."}

My husband and I arrived around 10am on a Friday. We started by looking at tanks filled with sea creatures ranging from eels, fishies, a baby shark, sand dabs, and a \"Finding Nemo\" tank that had all the fishes from the movie. There were also a lot of factoids about the Bay Area and a display of what our seas look like with trash. This particular exhibit had some hermit crabs, wandering amongst the glass bottles and whatnot. \n\nOnce we finished peering into every tank like excited schoolchildren, we moved on to the elevator, where it whisked us away to the \"tunnel\". The entrance to the tunnel has tanks filled with brightly colored jellyfish and then suddenly, you are underneath a large see-thru tunnel. During the elevator ride, the guide told us that the tunnel is filled with sea creatures that are native to the Bay Area. Here we saw sharks, rays, starfish, and enormous bass fish. It was amazing! I felt like I could have burst out some Little Mermaid songs about being under the sea. While staring fascinated at the sea creatures, a scuba diver swam by and we were able to see some of the fishes eat. Once feeding time was over, we moved into an area with a large octopus and then rode the elevator to our next stop. \n\nThe next exhibit allowed us to pet baby rays. They were so tiny and curious, swimming around randomly and bobbing up inquisitively. It was a lot of fun! We also saw some snakes, frogs, and turtles. Near the back of this exhibit was a tide pool area where I was able to pet starfish, sea cucumbers, sea anemones, and the like. When we were done with that, we walked around the corner to the otter exhibit. The first thing we saw was an adorable otter swimming in lazy circles, using his hands and feet to push off the glass to give him momentum. Around the corner of the exhibit, another otter slept on some rocks. \n\nAfter the otters, we were back at the entrance of the Aquarium with a gift shop. The gift shop had a lot of cute souvenirs ranging from clothing, purses, jewelry, stuffed animals, etc. The stuffed animals were really cute and I wish I brought one home as a souvenir.\n\nOverall, this was one of the best attractions at Pier 39 and I would do it again in a heartbeat. If you are in the area, definitely check it out. It is great for all ages, so the entire family can enjoy!", "author": "Nicole B."}

Tickets are cheaper by a $1 or so if you purchase online and yes locals get a discount(online as well.) Don't bother with driving and parking if you're close to BART; take the F on Market after getting off on Embarcadero(get a Clipper card for most convenience.) \nOnce we got to Pier 39 and had lunch, we were ready for a stroll through the Aquarium. You can see from outside the building that it is small so I'm not clear on why my fellow Yelpers complain on what it is obvious.  The aquarium is compact and clean. They have included lots of info about local wildlife. Highlights were the tunnels(sharks!) and the touch pool where a friendly ray splashed my daughter from head to toe. \nGoing on a weekday was good as we didn't have to deal with crowds. The gift stores are strategically placed at the beginning and end of the museum tour so be prepared to avoid paying $20 for a tiny stuffed seal or $26 for your green-screen family photo. \nOutside, Riveropolis is a free play area where the kids can build rafts with a supply of various corks, wooden blocks, rubber hands, and toy sea animals", "author": "Julie C."}

I tried taking my 2(almost3)-year old son to MBA about a month back and I don't know if the size of the place was too much for him, or what, but it failed to hold his attention and we were out of there in less than 1.5-hours; total waste of money. Fast forward a few weeks and I get an email for an Amazon Local deal for 1/2-off adult ticket at the Aquarium of the Bay and I thought what the heck. I've always wanted to check this place out and for 50%-off, why not? I'm certainly glad I did. My son was way more into it and we had a much better time. My theory is they push you through a self-guided tour because the place is so tiny -in comparison to the MBA- that there's no room for milling about smartly; there's a set course and you have no choice but to go where they want you. It's called structure which is what small children require. But, you didn't come here for a parenting lesson; so here are the highlights of the AoB:\n\n1) Under the Bay - There's around 300' of moveable sidewalk that guides you through these glass tubes as all manners of fish and marine life swim around you. This was so much fun we went through it twice! I tell you it's pretty fun watching an 8-foot Seven Gill Shark & huge Manta Rays swimming right at your head! \n\n2) Tide Pool - This is always a perennial kid favorite. What Toddler doesn't love touching starfish, sea cucumbers, anemones and splashing around the water?    \n\n3) Otterly Amazing - The new Sea Otter exhibit was really well built and gave you a ton of viewing angles to check out these cute, furry creatures romp around. They even had a tree in there that those rascals loved to climb! Who knew Otters could climb a tree?\n\nAll-in-all this was a pretty fun 2-hours and there was hardly any grumbling from the Little Tyrant.

Often there are little kids running around with no parents in sight - not that that is uncommon - but come on people there is a moving walkway for unattended children to hurt themselves on. \n\nThey pretty much just have jellyfish, fish, sharks and some other sea creatures - nothing too big or fancy. There is a section that has some sea creatures the kiddies can touch and some mammals/reptiles as well.  It is nice to walk under the shark area and see everything swimming above you but again...only if you are not being rushed by screaming children and rude people pushing up against you because it is so small in there. \n\nThe second time I went we opted to stay on the elevator....big mistake...I thought I was going to die.

I won 2 tickets and I was very excited for our first trip here and to learn more about the place. We parked at Pier 39 parking garage ($9/hour), conveniently located across the street.  It was foggy and very cold and windy! We practically ran to the Aquarium and up the stairs to the entrance where we were ID'ed and let in, but hardly greeted by any of the four employees we encountered.  We were each given complimentary drink tickets (won with the VIP ticket prize) - which was awesome because the rum punch they were serving in the tiny rocks glass was $8.00!\n\nThere were several displays with land animals.  I didn't know why they would keep two chinchillas in a tiny glass cage in an aquarium. The frogs and snakes and turtles seemed more fitting.\n\nA woman spoke to the audience while we were being fed nachos, sliders, and a noodle dish, from three local restaurants (Wipeout Bar and Grill,Fog Harbor Fish House, and Pier Market, who ran out of the scallops they were serving with the noodles before we arrived.) The food was very good and the speaker was very entertaining.  She is the sustainable initiative manager for the Aquarium and has studied the effects of plastic pollution in the ocean. It was amazing to hear her speak about the pollution she saw as her expedition team sailed across the Atlantic. \n\n We waited in a slow line to go downstairs to the tunnels where we were able to view many more fish. The Aquarium was actually very full with several different species. Some of the fish were HUGE! Even the starfish were much bigger than I expected. It was really neat to watch them swim past us. I loved looking at their eyes and faces, searching for smiles on their fish lips.\n\nThe Aquarium has a gift shop near the entrance.  They sold trinkets and fish-themed necklaces and tee-shirts, as well as photos they took of their guests (in pirate costumes) earlier in the evening.  The $21 package of less than 5 pictures wasn't a sell for us, but we did go back and take some pictures on our own phone with the pirate gear!\n\nThe \"silent disco\" meant wearing headphones as you walked around that had 3 music stations to choose from. Many of the guests were drinking and dancing and having lots of fun in the tunnel. It was definitely not a silent disco for them as they stomped and danced.  You had to give your ID over to the staff in order to \"check-out\" a pair of the headphones. (Which was why the line was so slow getting down to this level.) The system they used for holding the MANY driver's licenses and passports they were collecting was surprisingly disorganized and we waited a long time in line to receive AND return our headphones.  With $9/hour parking you'd think they'd have a better idea of how to keep the IDs in some sort of efficient (alphabetical) order. But standing in the line did give us time to finish our second free beverage (went with a tasty bottled Hefe beer). \n\n The event was really cool....for free.  The regular $25 tickets plus Eventbrite fee would have left me very disappointed had we actually paid to attend this.  I thought the staff was terrible.  The woman operating the elevator to and from the tunnel told us about their switch to a non-profit only a few years ago, and the work she does to bring children to the Aquarium free of charge. She was the only person who told us anything about the place and there were lots of staff walking around.  I know this is a huge tourist destination, given the location, but we would have loved to learn more about the place.  It's also much smaller than the Monterey Bay Aquarium, so if you've been into that gorgeous Aquarium, don't expect anything near the same size.  The jelly fish displays were probably my favorite thing here. The beautiful boneless fish are mesmerizing. I was really glad to get to see this place and especially for such a unique event; hopefully they continue to improve their execution of nighttime events for guests.\n\nThanks to FunCheapSF for the free tickets and unique date night with my husband!", "author": "Amy S."}

Overall, I was disappointed by the Aquarium of the Bay. It really fell short of what I was expecting. Let me briefly break it down...\n\n*About $26 to get in for an adult ticket (kids are less). \n*If you don't have children, you can easily get in and get out in under one hour. \n*There are two levels of this aquarium, but they're both kind of a joke. \n*I will give them credit for the bottom level since you're pretty much walking through a tube surrounded all around by fish, sharks, starfish, sting rays, etc. It was pretty cool. But, you'll be through it in maybe 15-20 minutes (depending on how fast you walk and how many pictures you take). I wish they had more animals down here to be honest. \n*Top level is smaller and not too much to do unless you have kids with you. They have a couple of tanks where you can actually pet whatever animals they have in there (which was pretty cool) and they also have a couple small tanks to look at other animals. This level you can be done with in 10-15 minutes. \n*There's a gift store. It has pretty cool stuff and I was tempted to buy a couple of items. \n\nOverall, this place is so small and not so fun if you're an adult. If you have kids with you, it probably would be more fun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-09", "description": "I had low expectations of this aquarium for several reasons, including reading some of the reviews on Yelp and coming here YEARS ago when I was a kid when it was much smaller and kind of dumpy). I was pleasantly surprised, though! Although a smaller aquarium than the Monterey Bay Aquarium and California Academy of Sciences Steinhart Aquarium, I thought they had plenty to offer in a small package (native fish, tropical fish, sharks, jellyfish, otters, and other small animals including an opossum and a couple of chinchillas). Everything was very clean and well-maintained and that staff was super friendly and helpful. The bathrooms were very clean, too, with plenty of stalls.\n\nThe only thing I really didn't like was the use of elevators to get to the floor with the underwater tunnel and jellyfish. I am not a fan of elevators and being crammed in a small space with a bunch of people including screaming, rambunctious kids and people with huge strollers is not my idea of a good time. Unfortunately, the doors to the stairway were locked and we couldn't find anyone to open the doors at the time (although the staff was very understanding of me not liking elevators), so we waited until the evening when less people were there to go down to the floor with the underwater tunnel. Everything else is accessible via the top floor, though (the fish displays, animal displays, and otters). The elevator did have a staff member there to control the elevator, so that was reassuring. They also tell you more about the animals they have there.\n\nMy favorite exhibits were the tropical fish tank (I LOVE tropical fish and they had a lot of cute clownfish there) and the otters. The otter exhibit was much nicer than I expected and pretty big. The three otters we saw seemed very happy playing together and would come up to the glass every now and then. The underwater tunnel was also beautiful and much bigger with more fish in it than from what I remember from when I was a kid.\n\nSome Tips:\n\n- If you have a membership to a zoo that participates in the Zoo Reciprocal Admissions Program, make sure you show them your membership card to get a discount. My boyfriend and I are members of the Oakland Zoo, so we both got 50% off our admission. There are also sometimes coupons available online and Groupon offers deals at times, too.\n\n- Go in the evening during their summer hours (open until 8pm), if you can. There were much less people on the day we went (Sunday) during that time and we could actually enjoy the exhibits for the most part (although there were still some screaming, undisciplined kids there, which is pretty much to be expected).\n\n- The otters are asleep during the day, so if you want to see them really active, go during the early morning or late evening hours. We saw them first when they were sleeping around 4:30, but came back around 6:30 and they were running all over the place and playing.

My classes used to take field trips here, and I loved the tunnel where you can see the fishes swim above you. I thought it was the coolest thing. Now, however, that I'm older, this place doesn't seem so cool. It's a relatively small aquarium but they do have a lot of stuff to see. And I like that there's an area where you can touch the starfish and sting rays--that was the highlight of my visit. My favorite was also the jellyfish, which looked really pretty, and I was able to capture some good photos of them.\n\nOverall, I still think this is a place worth visiting, if you happen to take a trip to Pier 39.

We parked our stroller just outside the main entrance. Staff was helpful (although clearly they were instructed to tell people there was no stroller parking anywhere).\n\nOne has to adjust expectations: this is not the Monteray Bay Aquarium or the Vancouver Aquarium, and the space is very small due to the location. Entrance at other big aquariums will cost over $30, so at $22 it's not out of line in my opinion. (Do check your library Discover & Go program, or your tourism map for a discount coupon.) The space and displays are not flashy, and the elevator system is a little unusual - but it worked very well during our visit. (I can imagine it's tougher when crowded.) \n\nWe had a lovely experience. My daughter loves sharks, jellies and colorful fish, and there were plenty of those. The otters were being fed and running around in what seemed like (relatively) reasonable space. The tunnels are truly well designed and impressive, an ingenious use of such a small building. Sadly, my daughter was scared by the divers cleaning the shallow-Bay tunnel and we had to make a beeline for the exit. She is also too short to really take advantage of the touch pools, which is too bad because there were almost no other kids there at the time of our visit. \n\nThe possum and chinchilla exhibits are really, really small - frankly I think it would be better not to have them. \n\nAlso of note: there were a bunch of signs in Japanese that appeared related to the campaign to ban sharkfin soup. I totally support the campaign, but the signs looked almost like someone had \"hacked\" into the exhibit. Why no comparable English signs? \n\nOverall, considering my relatively low expectations, I'm happy to give the Aquarium of the Bay 4 stars. My daughter was pleased, too.", "author": "Brigitte G."}

Idea: put a staff member here dressed as a sea otter with a seaweed touching station on the far end.  Anything would really change the dynamic.  It's like taking kids to an amusement park for 30 minutes and then expecting them to, immediately following, sit patiently in your dentist's waiting room for an equal amount of time. \n\nBut I digress... fans of the Monterrey Bay Aquarium will love this, especially the tunnels.  This is what sets this small aquarium apart.  You'll still see other interesting exhibits here, albeit experiencing essentially the same animals and habitats on a reduced scale. But when you're driving close to 2 hours for that experience, scale is way overrated.  \n\nLet me demonstrate with Exhibit A: my 15-month-old son, Phoenix.  He has been to both parks.

There is a small room with tanks, a set of tunnels that run under large tanks, an exhibit where you get to touch rays and small sharks, and a river otter enclosure. It felt very small and we were through the whole thing, including walking through the two tunnels twice, in 25 minutes. I was left with the feeling that I'd missed at least half of the exhibits. My feelings were shared by others I overheard as we left. My family and I received a 50% discount for being members of the Oakland Zoo. Had we paid full price, $25/adult, I would have been severely disappointed.", "author": "Perry S."}

One that had underground tunnels through small exhibits that consisted of star fish, small sharks and sea bass. The other floor had a few exhibits with touch tanks and otters as the finale. There wasn't really any learning stations along the way or a variety of exhibits. \n\nI'd recommend waiting for groupons or discounts for this place.... Not worth the full price.

For such a small aquarium, the regular price ($18) seems a little high to me. However, I thought it was amazing. The first area you walk into coming off the elevator houses the jellyfish. And I'm not going to lie, I kind of wanted to cry when I saw them because they were so absolutely beautiful. I probably could've stayed in this room for 30 minutes but decided to venture on fairly quickly since I got there as soon as they opened and didn't want to get stuck with a bunch of people around me. \n\nThe next part of the aquarium is a large circular tank that surrounds a walkway and houses all kinds of life from sea stars, to octopuses and fish. The next surrounding tank had sharks, rays, and gigantic fish. They were all really cool. After that, you could \"touch the bay\" where you basically get to feel skates, sea stars, little sharks, etc. This was really cool and there were also some other animals in this area such as an opossum, snakes, turtles, slugs, etc. And then, just like that, it was over and I was kind of disappointed. My favorite part was definitely the jellyfish and made the whole experience worth it. I was just very surprised I got through the whole aquarium in roughly 45 minutes and I was taking my sweet time. \n\nAs I was leaving, there were a LOT more people there so I recommend walking in the doors as soon as they open them.

Sister got a groupon here that let our family go in for way cheaper so we decided to go last weekend.\n\nNice sunny day in SF. A bit windy but not too unmanageable! It was nice.\n\nGot inside the entrance and waited behind one family with a stroller to enter... not a good first impression because there were three employees and I was waiting there with our tickets so we could get them looked at and enter. One looked up and saw me but made no move or greeting towards me. I HATE that kind of thing so I just moved forwards and held up my ticket and said that we were here and here were our tickets. I waited patiently and isn't this the kind of training that employees go through? Sheesh.\n\nIt was cool going through the entrance I guess kind of. A small-ish room with some fish and etc. in small tanks. You pass this photo opp. where you can get your photo taken and the background will be photoshopped in as part of the ocean or something. Then you wait in line for the elevators that will take you downstairs. The employee girl was nice who took us in and out of the elevator though.\n\nThe next part was pretty cool! My favorite part. They have these underwater tunnels that you can walk through with fish and sharks and turtles and manta rays and starfish that you can look at. It was pretty awesome. There were some annoying people there too but can't help that. \n\nThere was even an octopus tank but it was pretty small... I would have thought it'd be bigger. The cool part of the tank was that there was this small crawl space underneath and it had a part where you could put your head in a dome shape that was in the tank. You couldn't even see the octopus which sucked but I found it in the very back of the tank hidden underneath some of the plants. I don't blame it wanting to hide away from people haha.\n\nThen you had to take the elevator again up which led to the small touching pools! This part was also pretty cool!! There was a small pool where there were baby sharks and baby manta rays. You were allowed to touch them as long as you touched them in the correct spots and an employee was there to remind everyone where with a sign and a microphone. Some of the people were annoying because a lot of them were with small kids who just kept splashing against the water and sharing the animals. Or there were people who could follow an animal a bit and shove against others. Besides that, it was fun to watch the animals go so close to you and that you could touch them. One small manta ray was super playful, sticking super close to the sides and coming up out of the water to sort of wave hi to you!! So cute.\n\nThe gift shop was a small room not too impressive. Bathrooms were clean but not too big. Overall, I feel like employees could have been way more friendlier and welcoming. The nicest employee was the one on the elevator who was kind of short with dark curly hair so good for her! The others could work on that. \n\nI would recommend not going UNLESS you would never go to the Monteray Bay Aquarium (waaay more worth it.

Honestly, this place is best when you take kids to see marine animals. There are ton of kids there. This is NOT a good place to go with friends and such.

I am sure that the cost is adjusted based on location being right along the Embarcadero, as well.\n\nStaff is friendly, helpful, and never short handed.\n\nThe exhibits are awesome!  There was a room of Jellyfish, the tunnel where you could see sea stars, sharks, sardines, sea bass, etc.  There was also an area where you can touch/pet a skate, sting ray, leopard shark, sea anemone, sea cucumber, and star fish.  \n\nAs much as I enjoyed the experience, I however did feel bad for the animals constantly being poked and prodded by us as spectators.  There was adequate staffing amongst the tanks where the creatures could be pet, but given the large amount of young children who disobeyed the rules, I felt bad for the treatment of the animals in captivity.  Maybe that's me being too much of a hippy!  \n\nThe Aquarium is quite nice but a little expensive for the number of exhibits.  However, given it's location I think that the price is justified. \n\nThey should also maybe offer ear plugs for adults who don't like listening to screaming children.

The Aquarium is located right at the beginning of Pier 39 and its bigger than you think it is when you look at it from the outside. There are three stories of marine fun to be had and the staff are well trained and very helpful when answering questions and helping visitors.

The place bottle necks in some areas so it gets a bit crowded at times but usually clears out pretty quickly. \n\nThe elevators are manned by a staffer who tells you a little about the next exhibit you're going to see and answers any questions people may have. It was a great experience because you felt like you were being very well taken care of and attended to. I really liked the jellies exhibit and the touch pools. I can't see how some people could rush through the place so quickly. The Bf and I spent almost 3 hours enjoying the aquarium.

We took Bart and the \"F\" tram in order to get to the aquarium which was easy and exciting for the kids who are usually buckled into their car seats. The boys were excited when they saw some of the signage to the aquarium, marketing answered their question as to whether or not they would see some sharks.\nThe tram took us right to the front door of the aquarium.  Entry was exciting in itself. They wanted to stop in the store, but we let them know that would be available to them on the exit from the establishment as well. We had arrived around 11 and had an hour before the shark feeding, which all of us agreed we want to see. Their first favorite was the \"trash in the bay\" tank exhibit. I asked them, \"which of these things don't belong with the fish in the tank?\"they loved identifying all the things that they knew about which didn't belong with fish. We found right away that the tanks were easily viewed by four-year-olds, very accessible, and there was such variety in each display area that they each could yell-out to the other what they were seeing and excited about. Because they were so excited and the aquarium was set up in a large circle they ran through the aquarium wanting to see each thing ( jellyfish, touch tanks, sharks, and otters) in an hour. We then asked them \"what was your favorite?\" And went back again for a second round seeing the things they like the most. One of my grandchildren loved the otters and the other the touch-tanks so we did those things one more time. With our hands stamped for entry in and out, we left for a quick lunch and then back for the 3-D movie.

At 3 years to 11 years, you pay $10 so at least for now, my son is free.\n\nThe aquarium is small so don't expect it to be like the Monterrey Bay Aquarium. When you enter, you see a few tanks of different fishes. Then you take an elevator down so you can see two types of jellyfishes (totally cool) and go through the tunnels. It's like being underwater and you have an employee that you can ask about the different fishes, sharks, rays, etc.\n\nAfter you explore that, you take the elevator up to the touch and feel pool. There is only one touch pool with rays and sharks and another toward the exit for starfish. There are glass containers where you can see chinchillas, turtles and snakes. After exploring that, you end up at the aquarium's small gift shop. There's a sign that says that there's a bigger gift shop across the way.\n\nWhen my son is older, we would check out the behind the scenes tour.

The displays themselves weren't super informative but it is fun.\n\nThe anchovies swimming in a big school around a circular tank was certainly a highlight. They were all going in the same direction... except for the one, who seemed to be swimming backwards. He did this for the 5 minutes I watched... A well spent 5 minutes in my book. \n\nOf course, if you want to see fish in a more natural habitat they have this giant fish tank you can actually walk in a tunnel through. You sort of feel underwater, as fish swim around and over you. It wasn't as big as I thought, but once we got out of the first section, and into the shark section my Yelp Review bounced to 5 stars. They weren't big sharks, but none the less, very very cool. Great photo ops here.\n\nAfter the tunnels you take an elevator up to the petting zoo. You can pet a shark, touch an urchin, or talk about baseball with the guys that work there. Apparently red sox fans are everywhere, and have taken over the SF Bay Aquarium. \n\nShow your AAA id, and this place is cheap for a tourist attraction. The proceeds to go to conservation and studies, so you can feel good about dropping you hard earned cash here.

Technically this place is a nonprofit (you can see their 990 filing online at their website) even though they seem like a lot of for-profit tourist traps.  We decided to add this to an afternoon where we started off at the Exploratorium.\n\nI'd heard of this place for ages and remember the controversy about building it at Pier 39 since it would displace part of San Francisco Bay. The employees were all extremely eager, earnest, and welcoming.  Most tourist traps sort of want to get people in and out, but they want people to enjoy their visits. Our kid was handed a crown shaped hat similar to a cardboard crown at Burger King, but where the points are shaped like shark fins.\n\nOverall it's OK for what it is, and perhaps shouldn't be compared to what it isn't - a world class aquarium like Steinhart or even Montery Bay Aquarium.  I understand a lot of visitors go because their San Francisco CityPass includes either this or Monterey Bay Aquarium (choose the latter if you can make it).  However, it's not bad if you can get a discount or maybe a freebie like we got.\n\nStill - a few things felt a little bit strange.  They've got Dungeness crab in one tank, and I understand they don't feed except on the ocean floor at higher pressure.

I understand that unlike most aquariums which exist for spectacle, this site functions as a replica of the aquatic life in the San Francisco bay and contains many local elements of sea life . However , the museum lacked detailed placards to denote information on the marine life included at the aquarium. Rather you were presented a plethora of stock photos that named fish with minimal description. When attending an aquarium I'm interested in knowing the feeding habits of the fish, predators, level of endangerment, size, behaviors etc. The existing placards had little more than the general name for the fish, which is upsetting if the aquarium prides itself on the conservation and understanding of local sea life.\n\nIn addition to a lack of readable information about the sealife, the aquarium functions through the use of narrow elevators and no useable stairways. Although I appreciate the idea of mirroring scuba diving by \" descending \" to see the exhibits, alternative methods of seeing the museum would of made the experience less painful as being crammed into an elevator with strollers and families or waiting for several minutes for a clear elevator was uncomfortable.\n\nI will say that we enjoyed the conveyer belt walkthrough as it was cool to be \" under the bay \" as the schools of fish and sharks were nice to see .\n\nAfter walking through the two main floors you can go to a touch tank on the bottom floor and learn about conservation , which was informative and well done.\n\nI must lastly mention that one of the most condemning features of the aquarium and the one that really forced me to give 1 star is that the aquarium's final exhibit before entering a strategic gift shop is of bees. You read that right, one of the final images you see in the aquarium are bees.\n\nFor an aquarium that focuses on and prides itself on being about the education and conservation of local waters, I find the inclusion of bees to be flabergasting and poorly designed.

We thought that San Francisco (being a high profile city, and right by the ocean) would have the best one.\n\nWe were extremely disappointed.\n\nFirst off, as many have said, the place is overpriced at around $20 a ticket. (We did get $2 off, I think, for parking in the garage nearby and getting a coupon.)\n\nNext, the architect that designed the place was dumb. I guess he did not think KIDS and BABIES would come to an aquarium. They have different floors in this place and only 1 elevator which 50 people at a time with strollers and everything try to cram in. You have to ride this elevator two times. (Oh, the \"first\" floor of this place is actually the second floor. So before you even go into the front door, you need to ride a service elevator which is super tiny and can only fit 2 strollers in there).\n\nAll this elevator cramping ruined the entire experience. Additionally, there weren't any fish/animals note worthy in this place anyway.\n\nOverall, this is just a poorly designed aquarium. Families with KIDS are the #1 clientele for aquariums and the fact that you have to go up and down on elevators all day long is just plain dumb.. (at least have more than one elevator if you are going to build a multi-story aquarium)\n\nI always thought the Dallas aquarium wasn't that impressive (well... compared to the aquariums I see in movies and tv shows). But I must say, it is the best one out of Dallas, Boston, and San Fran. Check it out if you are ever in D-town.", "author": "Sam Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-04", "description": "I am a big fan of aquariums and being in San Francisco for vacation I thought I would have to check this place out.  First of all, this aquarium is extremely small- you can see everything in well under and hour.  When you first go in, you see a couple of tanks with various types of fish in them.  There is also some educational information about the area that you can read.  Following this short section, you must take an elevator to the floor which contains a couple of jelly fish tanks and a large walk through tank.  \n\nThe walk through tank was the best part about this aquarium.  You walked through and the fish, sharks, sting rays ect surround you (like you are in a tunnel).  After going through this section, you must then take another elevator back to the original floor you started on where you the other side of the elevator opens to a section which contains a few touch tanks.  I imagine that kids would really love this area as they can touch sharks, rays, seastars and other marine life.  In addition to the touch tanks there are a few other tanks with chinchillas, snakes, and reptiles.  Once finished with this, you walk through the gift store to exit.\n\nThe way this Aquarium is set up is extremely poor.  You have to ride up and down the elevator twice which makes it a little more difficult- I imagine quite difficult if you have a child in a carriage or a large group.  When going down to the level with the walk through tank, I encountered others on the elevator who could not figure out how to exit the Aquarium.  There is no real clear signage about where to go.  With San Francisco being on the water, I expected more from this aquarium.  I have been to the Boston, Baltimore, and Monterey Aquariums, all of which are much better then this one.  Overall, this might be enjoyable to take a young child to, but I would not waste the money to pay for the whole family.", "author": "Erin G."}

I had a membership to the aquarium in Boston, which was HYOOJ, and in which I spent many, many fond hours.  So I was kind of hesitant to enter another aquarium, particularly since I had heard that San Francisco's aquarium was smaller, and that in fact the marine life are spread out over several different museums (you can actually see some of the cooler stuff at the Academy of Sciences - including penguins and the albino alligator).\n\nHowever, when I did end up at Aquarium of the Bay, it was still a really good experience.  The focus is on marine life that you could see in the bay and Pacific Ocean, and I like that very much.  I also liked the tunnels, through which I walked veeeery slooooowly, looking for octopuses.  They're always the trickiest to find, and stuff themselves in amusingly tiny spaces!  Having the fish not just on either side of you, but above as well, really does let you get up close and personal.  There was even a small school of (I think) anchovies that you could observe swirling around all silver-like.  I had never really gotten to see a school in action like that, and it brought back fond memories of the bait balls from \"Blue Planet,\" although (SPOILER ALERT!) it never really ends well for the poor fellas.\n\nI also liked the touch tanks.  Come now, fellow adults - you're never too old to touch a shark, are you?  I stick my hand in there every chance I get.  Besides, rays in particular like to be pet, or so I hear.  What was also really impressive was the extent of creatures available for touching.  Sharks, rays, anemones, sea stars, sea cucumbers - I have to say that all those blow Boston's horseshoe crabs right out of the water.  Yes, that pun was so very intended it hurt.  I had a very nice discussion with a 7-year-old about touching anemones, and how sticky the tentacles are at first.  I say \"at first,\" because you probably don't want to be touching them for too long at a time.  My new friend informed me that they will indeed sting you.\n\nEverything is so well-arranged and cared-for, I just wish there were more of it!  The $17 you pay is definitely for quality instead of quantity, but all the same I feel it's a little steep.  If you combine the pricing and the size, there's not a ton of repeat-value, but there is some.  I'll wait a little while, but I'll be back.  Aquarium-elitist though I am, I also just love aquariums.

The experience was fun while it lasted, bur the thing is, that was not very long.  Tunnels in the aquarium contained numerous species of water animals, along with some background information.  The atmosphere felt very touristy; for an aquarium, it was okay, with some nice views, pretty exhibits, and color, but lack of uniqueness.\n     Experience:  Actually, the experience in the aquarium itself, while it lasted, was enjoyable.  The water tunnels were very picture worthy, and we rode on the elevators transitioning between exhibits.  The number of exhibits came to only ten or fewer.  It was quite unexpected when we ran into the gift shop when leaving the otter exhibit.  Somewhat nice water views make up for a lotof it, though.  Four star overall experience, but around two-and-a-half star duration.\n     Duration:  Not very long; probably 1/2 hour to 1 hour, tops.  Only eight to ten exhibits that are still nice to stare at for a few minutes.\n     Atmosphere:  Why, yes.  The atmosphere...is good.  Don't get me wrong, there still is a lot to improve and remodel here, but it's ambient.  It feels just like an aquarium should: calm, peaceful, serene, relaxing. stress-free, picture-worthy, and most of all, beautiful to observe.\n     Overall:  Aquarium of the Bay is nice overall, and the aquatic tunnel portions are A-OK.

Didn't have to much of a selection of things to view, but if you have never been anywhere before this will still be a great place to take the kids to  see everything. It's something additional and exciting on the side to do if you are spending the day at Pier 39. The reason why I am a FAN of this place is because they also have a BAY CRUISE! My husband and I purchased tickets that let us view the aquarium then go on this cruise and the cruise in itself was magical and I LOVED every second of it.\n\nThe Cruise picks you up at Pier 39 very close to the Aquarium and it takes a good hour to get through. It takes you down to the Golden Gate Bridge, then around Angel Island, very up close and personal with the Alcatraz Island (you can't walk down though), but it is close enough to see a lot of details and you are able to read the writing on the sign and walls. Then it takes you by the Bay Bridge and then you come back to the Pier. The Cruise is very detailed with historical events that took place including the importance of the two bridges and the history behind the Angel and Alcatraz Island. Of course Alcatraz caught more of my attention. My husband and I originally tried to go on the Alcatraz Tour but not buying tickets in advance the tour is sold out until September, so this cruise is the closest thing to it and I really enjoyed myself. I would take kids of any age to the aquarium, however for the Bay Cruise I would only take children ages 8 and up.

The exhibit is indoors.  No fresh air.  These are wild animals that need fresh air and sunlight.  The  woman on staff couldn't even tell us about the otters - where they came from, their ages, their story. I'm not talking about someone in the gift shop or front desk.  The person standing near the exhibit who is supposed to be there for questions. Educating the public on caring for our oceans and wildlife? Nope. Sad story. Not going back.  And the response below appears to be a typical PR response.  I really don't have any interest in hearing that the habitat meets regulation standards.  SeaWorld says that too, and nothing makes it OK to keep an Orca in a pool.  I'd say make your own judgement and research it before going.  I hope they improve things for the animals in their care.", "author": "Lisa C."}

It's neat to have a focus on the Bay specifically, to learn about the ecosystem underneath the beautiful views from the Wharf.

Because it only takes about an hour to go through, it's probably not worth a solo trip, but it's a good cornerstone to the Fisherman's Wharf experience.

There were so many people inside that I wasn't able to look at all the fishes but that was probably because It was on the weekend. I was so amazed with the water tunnels filled with sharks and stingrays. One of my favorite exhibits was the jellyfishes because it reminded me of the movie 7 pounds.

The Aquarium of the Bay was worth every unpaid cent and now would gladly return and with friends to show them this grand place! I walked half a mile and was third in line when it opened 12,6mins later.  I showed them my DL with my North Beach address and though I had brought an official letter sent to my address, they didn't request it unlike the CaS neighborhood days when residents are requested to show two types of ID. \n\nI've never been within the Aquarium of the Bay so I didn't know what to expect but started snapping right away as the exhibits were so interesting, but I *really* wanted to see the jellyfish exhibit, which is an elevator-ride away. I don't know if it was designed this way or not, but to me (remember my California Academy of Science blah experience) their jellyfish was in a huge exhibit which wasn't cleaned, so the glass dirt ruined my pixs of the jellyfish there. Here it seemed the HUGE gorgeous jellyfish were UP AGAINST THE WALL/GLASS, and it's really breathtaking! I snapped only a thousand pixs - just kidding. It's certainly worth more and the glass was so clean, which I explained later to a girl I saw cleaning the glass of a dry exhibit. The other section I spent the most time was the tunnel with fish and more swimming to the left, to da right and even above you! I am sure glad many of these don't have private organs sticking out or there'd be some very upset parents and excited kids!!! hahahahaaa  I loved it and again, the glass was clean for the most part and allowed me to photograph great pixs! A wonderful experience!\n\nPHOTOGRAPHICALLY SPEAKING: Don't take a tripod as it'll be more of a hinder than a help. There are several areas where one would certainly be helpful, but because of the dark areas and kids running about, you'll soon regret using a tripod. In my digital SLR, I just upped the ISO to an usable speed and/or brace thyself against something like a wall. The jellyfish and the tunnel offered the most interesting subjects but lighting is tricky in both exhibits. One thing that I did see was in the AWB the colors didn't come out correctly due to the mix of several light sources. One thing is to set your camera - if able - and use a foto with a light source captured within the AoB, and set that to be your custom white balance. NO flash photography of the octopus exhibit, and personally I don't think it should be allowed in the dark exhibits also. \n\nMany thanks to Aquarium of the Bay for having a SF residents' day ~ happy shooting!!!!", "author": "Tony L."}

It was cheaper than the Baltimore aquarium and way less crowded as far as tourist pier aquariums go (we didn't even end up going in there it was so crowded/overpriced!) so maybe people in CA are just not used to aquarium prices?

Then you go through one curving glass tunnel, followed by a handful of more exhibits, then another curving glass tunnel which leads back to the elevators.

The glass tunnels were actually a great sight to see. Many interesting fish and sharks. The touch pools were good except that there was only about 4 rays and a shark, with 2 of the rays and the shark not feeling very playful and were just hanging out at the bottom. The other pool was full of starfish and well, once you touch one you pretty much have touched them all.\n\nI was iffy on the last set of exhibits because they had non-marine animals on display (Chinchillas in an aquarium?

It had few stingrays and like 1 shark. You then take the elevator again to the \"hands on\" exhibit. Now here is where they redeem themselves. You could touch a variety of stingrays, including baby ones along with small sharks. There are other \"hands on\" exhibits as well. Lastly, there are advertisements for their otter exhibit. They are all over Fisherman's Warf. However, the hype dramatically over sold it. My heart sank to find out that they only have 2 otters in a medium sized glass enclosure.

Because we can't just Google it. There is also a tub with starfish and sea cucumbers which you can stick your finger in to pet the sea animals.

(Other aquariums sometimes have tunnels, but nothing like this.)  \n\nOne thing that may not be obvious:  This is a *great* aquarium for a toddler in a stroller, because all the exhibits are visible from the stroller.   In many aquariums you will get tired from holding the kid up to see into the tanks.  Here everything is visible from toddler eye-level, and my toddler had a great view from the stroller.   Check out the tank that features the bottom-dwelling fish, for example.  I imagine that this might be a benefit for someone in a wheelchair also.\n\nThey had the best-displayed octopus I  have ever seen.

The employees are without exception passionate and knowledgeable about the aquatic life in their care, and are quick to answer any questions you may have.\n\nWhile Aquarium of the Bay may not be as big and built up as the Monterey Bay Aquarium, it does what it sets out to do, and that is to provide a \"fish eye\" view of life in the San Francisco Bay.", "author": "C P."}

However, if you make it through here in 20 minutes then I'm afraid you're not really looking, listening, and discovering what the aquarium has to offer!  There are thousands of fish in there!  Also, check the time board for presentations going on all day!  There are live feedings every day and presentations going on ALL the time that guests miss!  Don't miss them! I used to feed the bat rays in the touch pools every day and talk all about how they live and eat and people seemed to really enjoy it!\n\nAlso, some folks mentioned things about fish \"just floating\" or \"just swimming around\" and even \"dead\" and \"belly up.\"  The Aquarium of the Bay has vets and husbandry staff on every day that dive in the main tunnel tanks to check on the animals, making sure they're happy and healthy.  The fish that these folks are referring to as dead or floating are actually a type of fish called \"Rock Fish.\" Their behavior is to do just that, look like rocks!  They're very common in the bay!  They have poison in those barbs on their backs!  THEY'RE SO COOL!  Other injuries you might spot are animals the aquarium has found in the wild and rehabilitated (like Lenny the White Sturgeon, who lost his whiskers and has difficulty searching for food in the wild) or injuries due to common behaviors in the wild (such as female Leopard Sharks getting their fins bit during mating season).\n\nLastly someone mentioned the leopard sharks in the touch pools being \"drugged\" and motionless and \"boring\", they're not drugged, and that's actually a good thing that they're still for the benefit of the sharks, that means they're very calm.  Those sharks are very young, and when they get excited or scared, they could thrash around and possibly jump out of the tanks and injure themselves.  The aquarium has to have smaller/shallower tanks so the little ones can touch the animals, but that also entails having very calm, relaxed young sharks.\n\nHope that clears up some things.  If this is viewed as an advertisement because I am a former employee, then that's understandable I guess.  I just wanted to clear up some misinformation.  \n\nRemember that aquariums are for you to view the animals, not for the animals to give you a song and dance routine.  They're wild creatures, and deserve our curiosity and wonder based on their own merits, even if they look like rocks, heh heh.", "author": "Becky G."}

I never even thought of going to the aquarium on past visits to San Francisco because other have been expensive and disappointing. \nI was delighted! I truly never expected an aquarium in a tourist area to be such a good representative of indigenous sea life, nor to be so educational. There were a number of activities for preschool - elementary aged children and amusing photo ops like an aquarium with a bubble from the bottom so children (and myself) could have my picture taken inside the aquarium. The staff was knowledgeable, twice I asked a question that they couldn't answer, so they went and got the answer, and found me to tell me what I wanted to know! That is rare customer service! Thank you!!\n\nThey have two smaller aquariums that contain two different kinds of jellyfish- that were in pristine condition. Absolutely beautiful! The lighting is excellent and the water is clean enough that you can really see them... see through them... watch them move inches from you. Mesmerizing.\n\nThe glass tube was surprisingly long and gave a long opportunity to watch the behavior of the fish. There is a moving walkway for those who just want a quick view and a stationary walkway for those like myself who want to linger and watch the behavior of the animals. (Sea World does not offer an opportunity to go at your own speed!)\nThe schools of silver fish (sardines) that make shapes in the movie \"Finding Nemo\", they really swim together in a bunch like that (of course they don't really mimic faces). I've never been to an aquarium that had large schools of fish that allow you to see how they act together! Fascinating!\n\nMy absolute favorite was the petting grotto... I got to pet a bat ray! The bat ray's were friendly and not stressed out. What a treat! There are also small shark to pet, healthy sea anemone, sea cucumber, a variety of healthy looking starfish to touch. There is a honey bee exhibit that is pretty interesting too!\n\nAll in all, the message about protecting the planet and its creatures was consistent but not political, and backed up by sea life that is well cared for- you will not feel guilty enjoying this aquarium, the animals are well kept!\n\nI see reviews of people who were disappointed... maybe they were expecting the Shamu show? I'm guessing they tromped through with the energy of the city and didn't take time to see all the little surprises throughout the building from start to finish! \n\nMy thanks to Aquarium Of The Bay for a lovely afternoon!

I specifically took my family here on a Thursday so that we could catch the shark feeding.  The first time we went through the tunnels, we were busy taking pictures of the sharks and bat rays.  We had time to kill before the shark feeding, so we got our hands stamped and wandered around before coming back.  The second time we went through the underground tunnels, we just simply enjoyed looking at large variety of fish and being slightly creeped out by the sharks that were swimming right up at us.  \n\nNormal ticket price is $15.95, but you can get a $2 coupon from any of those SF tourist map books.  It's actually great to go back through the exhibits twice because you miss stuff the first time around.  Right now (May '09) there is a new exhibit of huuuge jellyfish and a ginormous octopus too.

Of course the day we planned ended up being a Wachovia Wednesday, so I anticipated a crowd.  Realizing that there would be traffic in the morning we left San Jose before 830 in hopes that traffic would have subsided a bit.  Well we were stuck on 19th for more than 30 minutes, and as we approached the park within 6 blocks or so, it was evident that we were going to be facing some traffic to enter the area.  After one attempt at passing through, and the kids restless and antsy we decided to make an impromptu detour to the Pier.  \n\nIt was the best decision we made all week.  No crowds, no parking problems, and an aquarium we have never visited.  Of course I didn't anticipate very much, and when expectations are low, simple surprises can definitely make your day.  Right we entered our ocean loving son when into \"Aquarium Guide\" mode making sure each and every one of us were educated about the sea creatures.  Below in the under water tunnels the treads were not working so we were free to walk as slow as we pleased.  The boy was in heaven.  \n\nThinking that the tour was done after the tunnels, it was a nice surprise to  see the touch pools at the end of the exhibit.  This place has the best touch pools.  They've got rays and sharks, and we had no crowds to fight.   Lots of fun.

Recently, however, I have changed my mind believing that each place has its own beauty. So We took our almost 4-yr-old here hoping to spend 2 hours and we were pleasantly surprised.\n\nWith the help of illustrations, we identified many sea creatures, like various sharks (I explained how eating fish fins destroy these fish and we should never do that), school of sardines that my child loves to eat, bass that we spot at Ranch 99, rock fish that we just had the other day, funny-looking sheephead, sea cucumber, halibut sold at Costco, and counted tree frogs. We touched star fish, anemone, turtle, but it was difficult for my child to touch the bat ray or shark as the touch pool was too deep and there were too few swimming around (she got a bit annoyed, but that was fine since we can always touch them elsewhere). She was so excited to see 2 divers transferring sand from bottom of the shark tank to the window sill and she followed them all the way till they exited a small wooden door. She was also happy to stand on the walkway. As we admired the tranquil medusa, I mentioned to my child that plastic bottles appear like jellyfish to many fish and the fish will swallow the plastic trash and then die. I also commented that the many dead gulls, clams & crabs we found at Halfmoon bay probably died from pollution.\n\nThe otters hardly moved during our visit, which was disappointing. We should probably visit CuriOdyssey again to look at the otters. Nonetheless, my child was keenly interested in drawing otter paws with stencil and we spent a whole minute persuading her to finally move on to other exhibits.\n\nThe opossum and chinchillas appear to be sleeping throughout our visit. I wonder if they're healthy.\n\nAll the staff were knowledgeable and nice. I also learnt the easy way to tell the gender in adult turtles, as well as temperature-dependent sex determination in turtles. My child, however, was not at all intrigued.\n\nAll kids enjoyed sticking their head into a big transparent ball inside a tank (which lies outside one of the elevators). My child actually went in many times. The glass/plastic created some distortion making them look smaller. I too climbed underneath to see through the ball. However, I suspect looking through that material simulates wearing a pair of prescription glasses. So I took my child away immediately.\n\nLast but not least, we find the bathroom properly designed: hand controlled toilet flush that doesn't surprise you with an unpredictable loud flush, a sturdy step stool that will not slide for young children, NO 150 decibel hand dryers (those drive me crazy), automatic dispenser for paper towels. My child also loved hugging the plush toys at the gift shop.\n\nWe came on a Sunday and it became really crowded later on. We stayed for 3 hours but had to leave because parking was so expensive (I printed a ticket through my local library) and it was already past the nap time for my child. Aquarium of Bay also hosts a free educational display for sea lions but we didn't have time to look. Overall, we enjoyed this little gem and so did at least 85% of visitors we met. It'll be a sure hit with families with children. I'd come back more often if we didn't have to drive for 1hr each way and pay steep parking fees or admission fees.", "author": "Paris C."}

There's three levels that offer general insight about various fish and sea life.  The tunnel is a pretty cool area where you can admire the different types of fish, starfish, leopard sharks, and other animals.  On the top level, they have a very small area that contains painted sea life on canvas... pretty nice if you appreciate that stuff.  Also, they have a place where you get to touch the animals such as the sting ray and the leopard shark.  \n\nThe employees are knowledgeable, informative, and open to any questions you have.  \n\nAll in all, this place is great for people of all ages!\n\nPS: The prices are extremely affordable and pretty much worth it!\n\n$14.95 for adults minus $2.00 from the coupon in the booklet they give you when you purchase your fare at the cable car booth.

I've been to most of the important ones in the US, and the Aquarium of the Bay isn't a bad aquarium, it's just a lovely little commercial aquarium that has melded itself into the Pier 39 world of touristy restaurants, shops and attractions.\n\nThe tunnel is the highlight and I love looking at the Leopard sharks and I think a 7-gill that swims really close to the top of the tunnel. I love these tunnel experiences and this one was better than most. The octopus was awesome, and I'm a freak for 'em anyhow. I thought that the jellyfish exhibit was really nice and made me feel like I was getting something from Jellyfish since I missed the Monterrey Bay Aquarium's exhibit. \n\nIt's awfully pricey, but it's located in the heart of Tourist town, so I don't think we can expect much better.

We all loved the fish tunnel with many varieties swimming inches away. It was like being a diver rather than watching the fish bowl like most aquariums. In the middle of the week we had the first tunnel to ourselves but had to share the shark tunnel with some school groups which vastly increased the noise level. Other display areas were more typical  and smaller with more school groups and noise. A good choice for a two hour visit. If you want more time, varieties and science, try the others mentioned above.

The aquarium is on the small side and there are essentially three sections: a bunch of smallish tanks, a really cool pair of tunnels that make you feel like you are underwater, and then a \"hands-on\" group of pools with skates, rays, sharks, etc. It was definitely small but a lot of fun with kids and a pretty nice, low-key way to spend an hour or so.", "author": "Pablo P."}
