I live really close by so I have given them numerous chances and regret it every time. Their fries are stale, soggy, and often cold. The salad is a joke: the lettuce is white and tastes like paper, the tomatoes are not even red and look a week old. The cucumber is limp and vaguely bitter. The salad came as takeout via Grubhub and when I went back to ask for a refund bc it was so terrible, they said to contact Grubhub (I understand that's how it should work technically but may be try and make your customer happy when the issue is a $12 spoiled salad). The medium rare burger I asked for will come out well done, practically blackened, and so very dry. Other times it's alright, closer to medium. We literally live on the same block as them and a delivery order (I don't know why my bf this was a good idea instead of just walking over) once took over 40 mins. Seriously, don't waste your money.

This time, we weren't looking for a fancy burger with frills or anything; we were looking for a dirty burger that would satisfy that quintissential American need for meat on a grill.\n\nThe interior reminds me of an old 70s diner (not that I was alive to experience one -- I was born in the 90s). Rustic and kind of dingy paint job with rickety tables. I dig the feel.\n\nMy girlfriend played it safe and ordered the Big Mouth Burger, which is a quality burger that's clean and did her good. Being the adventerous warrior I am, I went a little further and ordered the Giants Burger. Let me tell you something -- the name isn't just homage to the baseball team down the road; it's actually giant. The patty is thick and is layered with cheese and lies under two onion rings that are both about a full inch thick and about as wide as the patty. The top bun has a slathering of BBQ sauce. By the time you throw on the lettuce, tomato, and red onions, you're looking at a burger that stands a full 5\" high. Needless to say, I had a pretty tough job getting that sucker in my mouth.\n\nBut when I did, it was SO worth it. The patty is cooked to perfection and really explodes with flavor and juice. The onion rings are probably some of the best I've ever had. Crispy, large, and seasoned amazingly! Absolutely perfect! Combined with the BBQ sauce, and they've got something really really good going. One thing to take note of, they should really consider renaming it to \"Cardiac Arrest Burger\". Remember how I talked about wanting to get a dirty burger? Well this is it. I could definitely feel my arteries fill with fat and all the Big Mouth goodness with every bite.\n\nThe burger also comes with a side of garlic fries, which my girlfriend and I personally thought were way too garlic-y and oily. Could definitely do without that distraction. If anything, they probably go way too far.\n\nBig Mouth Burger isn't for the weak of heart -- literally. \n\nEat on, champion.", "author": "Zi-on C."}

And the texture - far too gritty, I don't want to be sea added by a chorus of arthritic cow knuckles when chewing down. Relentlessly sawing at my teeth.

We went there after a sunny day in Dolores Park and couldn't have picked a better spot. Quick service, beer on tap and a good selection of burgers, although once I read what was in the Giants Burger I read no further.  It has provolone cheese, onion rings, bacon, lettuce, tomato, & BBQ sauce with Garlic Fries.  Yes. That was EXACTLY what I wanted. \n\nWe got a table outside and before we knew it, the most delicious looking food was in front of us.  My friends got other burgers but everyone agreed my Giants Burger looked the most delicious.  Stacked VERY tall and perfectly cooked, I couldn't be happier.  The bacon was on point and the onion rings were nice and fat and battered just right.  And those garlic fries... were crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and oh so greasy in the best way possible. Rather than being topped with diced garlic which I expected, they may have been drenched in garlic butter. Whatever it was, it worked though.  I felt like a pig but every bite was amazing.\n\nI like that they don't pretend to be anything other than a burger joint that makes delicious burgers.

I actually stood in the doorway and studied the options before approaching the counter to place my order.  I had a Big Mouth Burger on a French roll with the Spicy Chipotle Mayo and I had provolone cheese added for a bit extra.  I chose the French Fries as my side order and I had a canned soda.  There is a free water dispenser beside the cash register area.  They give you a number, you find a table and they'll bring your food to you when it's ready.\n\nThe restaurant is super busy during the lunch hour, and since the burgers are cooked to order expect a bit of a wait.  The wooden tables and chairs are well worn, but they're situated close enough so you can glance at what your neighbor is eating without being rude.  \n\nI was quite excited when my food (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ZPVCTXm4olsIEk4rWwAIWQ?select=-0VGLm7m4lezFu-ZVgLpNQ) arrived, and the first thing I noticed was the huge amount of cheese on top of the burger.  I was curious about the spicy chipotle mayo because so many other reviewers have written about how good it is.  I took a fry and wiped some mayo on it for a taste even before I assembled the burger.  Oh my, the spicy chipotle mayo is awesome!  The fat skin-on fries are very meaty, but I wished for a bit more crispiness on the outside.\n\nThe burger comes with the usual accompaniments of fresh leaf lettuce, sliced tomatoes, a slice of red onion and pickle chips.  It's stated that the burger is \"broiled medium\" but mine was more like medium/well.  There was just a hint of pink color in the meat, but the burger remained somewhat juicy.  I loved the provolone cheese which had fantastic stretch and tasted very milky.  Overall, it was a very good burger, and I will definitely return.

Nope, it's really more of a working-class burger joint with furniture bought from a fire sale at Frontier Village. Whatever happened to Frontier Village, by the way?\n\nAnyway, a hearty burger can be found here. I had the $6.40 Big Mouth Burger which was definitely a good portion of beef cooked medium. You get your choice of breads, spreads and extras. Not quite the variety found at Custom Burger but not the same price either. I went for a toasted French roll with spicy chipotle mayo and a slice of melted pepper jack cheese and a few sauteed mushrooms for good measure. The cheese and mushrooms did add $1.90 to the tab, but you do get a nice side of tasty steak fries, or if you're some health nut, you can have cole slaw or baked beans instead.\n\nI like the vibe in here, very casual with a lot of locals just hanging out, and the service is good. They are very good at giving you the stepwise directions in ordering if you're a rookie like me. It's very conveniently located a block up from the 24th Street BART station near Valencia.

There was just enough blue cheese to justify the name without being overpowering. \n\nThe onion rings were the bomb. They were tender and crispy with just a touch of sweet to the beer batter. I think they may be the best onion rings I've ever had in San Francisco.\n\nThe diet coke was a little expensive for a can of soda, but worth it for the caffeine boost it gave me.

Since we had devoured so much sweets and carbs for lunch we wanted nothing but salt and red meat for dinner. \n\nThe BF ordered the Big Mouth Burger and added avocado and mushrooms. I ordered the Hawaiian Burger- pineapple, teriyaki sauce, and bacon. We also ordered \"the biggest fries you got\" (although in retrospect perhaps we should asked for the largest order of fries, because although very Big Fries, there was only a few of them. I got two cans of diet coke (one can is never enough with salty food, plus the BF only ordered water so I knew he'd be stealing \"sips\"). Grand total with acceptable bistro service tip of 10% came to $28\n\nPros:\nThe burgers were good. Not med rare like I had asked for (more like med well) but still juicy enough. They also had to be atleast a half a pound. According to the menu they were also organic which made us both feel better about our gluttony. The toppings were clearly fresh and generously applied. I believe there was almost a full avocado on the BF's burger! The french fries were steak fries cut fresh in house and very tasty. We ate every one. They all served beer on draft though we did not partake, they had floats and milkshakes too. There was sufficient seating  inside and two outside tables. I liked the counter seat along the window best because 24th street is a great place to people watch.\n\nCons:\nThe first thing you notice walking in are the swarm of flies over the heads of the dining guests. I'm assuming they were not paying customers but since the doors and windows are open I assume they invited themselves. The restaurant has a crowded feel to it. I think they really tried to squeeze as many tables in as humanly possible! It terrifies me to think of eating there if the place was at maximum occupancy. \nLike I already mentioned the burgers were both over cooked. The meat, although organic, lacks flavor and may possibly contain no seasoning at all. The fries are salted perfectly but have no other seasoning and I believe they may wish to consider changing the frier oil a bit more often. Yesterday it was apparent that the grease was dirty. Kinda gross but we were hungry.\n\nI gave Big Mouth 3 stars because that is what 3 is right. Just Good. Although what bugged me most is the cost. $28 is too much for two burgers, one fries, and 2 canned sodas. I could've gone down to South End and had a burger, fries, and drink for $7 or to Pie for a slice and beer for $6.28.", "author": "Lisa H."}

The menu states they make everything to order and offer many options to add on to your burger like spreads, breads and cheeses. I got the big mouth burger with pepper jack cheese and garlic spread.

When I stepped up the counter to order my Anchor Steam I was sadly disappointed, as they don't have San Francisco's own. I settled for a Sam Adams. All the tables were clean but as I took my first sip of my fine frosty beverage I noticed that the ketchup bottle had dried crusty mustard stains inside while at the same time the glass had that scent that the dishwasher needed to be sanitized or that the glasses were washed with food. You know the scent I'm talking about, it's disgusting. I don't know about you but I don't like crusty mustard chunks in my ketchup and my beer smelling like anything other than beer. \n\nI ordered the Big Mouth Burger with fires. My burger was brought to me in less than five minutes with a large portion of potato wedges. The fries were cooked well done and were good. The burger on the other hand was a disaster. I only ate the entire thing because I was really hungry. The burger was so dry and flavorless that I considered ordering another beer to wash it down. The bun had been warmed but was more on the stale side than toasted. \n\nThe menu is so extensive though that I will be back some day in the far off future to try some of their other offerings. Another thing that will bring me back is the employees are professional and friendly and did give me the feeling that my business was genuinely appreciated.\n\nHealth Card = 94", "author": "Justin S."}

It was a short walk from the hotel, so I headed on over. \n\nThe place is kind of a dive, but clean. I ended up ordering a burger with bacon, mushrooms, avocado, blue cheese crumbles, and a garlic mayo or spread. The guy taking my order literally paused and gave me a look like \"are you sure??\", but then was like \"alright\". With fries and a can of Pepsi, it came out too $14. Way more than I wanted to spend on a burger, but I figured I'm on vaca so what the hell. \n\nWhen my order came out, I realized why he gave me that look... the burger was huge! I took one look and knew I wasn't going to be able to finish it. I have to say: THIS WAS THE BEST DAMN BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD!!! It was like a circus in my mouth! My pleasure button was on over load! It literally made my whole day. I'm half Filipino, and all Filipinos do is talk, think, and eat food, ha ha. So food can be my ultimate happiness, needless to say I was a happy camper :o) The fries were quite good as well. \n\nThe guy who took my order must have seen my face and came out and said \"Good burger eh? I come back with a box for you\" (think Russian or similar accent). I was more than happy later on when I was able to dive into this burger for a second round! \n\nIf you're in SF, don't pass this up for a good burger!!", "author": "Leonard T."}

Of course i knew she was kidding but i told her i was writing a yelp review. I go to use the restroom and when I come back my friend told me that she gave us some free dipping sauce.

The descriptions of the burger clearly say it's cooked medium so open your mouth and specify if you want something different. Don't down food service folks and food because you can't read a menu.

The seating is alright but not much room for a group. \n\nService: 3/5\nI guess a good burger takes a long time but 10 minutes for a burger when there was no line is a little lengthy.

I've tried a BBQ burger and the Big Mouth Burger (the signature/safe bet). The wait is worth it for the most part as the burger has fresh ingredients and is served open so you can add sauces.

Even if you count my $10.06 tab for Bacon-cheddar cheeseburger with fries and two cans of coke as high,,, what you have to realize is that you get more that two times the food that the same $10 would buy you are McD's.  So two people could buy a burger and split it for a completely satisfying meal.  The food is 10 times better as well.\n\nThe burger what just what I needed.  Meat was perfect.  The bacon was a little to crispy for the way I like it but was still very good.   The bacon definitely was not burned in any way.  The cheddar cheese was a peferct match for the rest of the burger and there was plenty of the both the bacon and the cheese.  The veggies were fresh and dawm good.  Purple onions!!  MMMMMM!\n\nHave a look at my photos. The cheese is oozing down the side of a tall patty.  A patty that other so-called burger joints put in the picture for advertising then yank it off the plate right before it's send out to you.  Big Mount delivers the same huge burger tasty on your plate as I had on mine.\n\nThe steak fries were the only questionable bit.  I thought they were a little to greasy.  But you know what?  I still ate 3/4 of the fries anyway!\n\nThey have soda and beer if you are looking to kick back a brew with your cow.\n\nIf you an SF dweller looking for a great charbroiled hamburger then get off yer dead one and get over to Big Mouth Burger.   \n\nIf you take public transit  it just a block west from the Mission station on 24th.   If you are taking the highway (101) get off on Chesar Chavez.  Turn left on 24 th and go about a mile.  They are on the right hand side of 24th (north side).\n\nWhile they aren't Val's (Hayward), Big mouth still makes one tasty burger.

In addition to being extraordinarily boring, Big Mouth Burger managed to hit 4 of my pet peeves in one visit.\n\n1.  Underseasoned, or unseasoned beef.  This is my biggest burger pet peeve.  I tasted the meat by itself, and it had no flavor to speak of.  Since there's a decent amount of the beef, it was like a black hole of flavor that made the whole burger taste bland.  I felt a little gross using the greasy and grimy salt and pepper shaker to try to coax some flavor out of it.  (It still didn't really help)\n\n2.  Overcooked beef.  The menu says their burgers are cooked medium.  Mine was cooked well done.  Not to the point of dryness, but it was not good.  It was actually on the bitter and unpleasant side.\n\n3.  Underseasoned, and soggy fries.  \n\n4.  High price.  \n\n\nI opted for the chipotle mayo spread.  It had a little zing to it, but it did not add anything to the burger, even when I put on some extra.  It didn't do much for the fries as a dipping sauce either.\n\n2 stars is being very generous.

Somehow, that magical barnyard mixture of cow meat (the burger) on top of pig meat (the bacon) delicately topped with some secrections of a cow's teat (the cheese) has just been consuming my soul recently. It happens every so often after I get tired of drinking my unicorn horn and rainbow milkshakes.\n\nAnyways, when I walked in, I was pleasantly surprised to see quite the menu selection! You'd think a burger place would only have a lot of burgers (and IMO, that is their general failing). However, this one has chicken, turkey burgers, sausage, and veggie options! I hit up some linguicia.\n\nThe linguicia was delish. Juicy, greasy, spicy mustard, and onions on a toasted bun. What more could you want? Oh yeah, a giant pile of fresh cut fries (could have been crispier, but I know this is an artifact of the fresh cut-edness).\n\nThere is some beer here too, but nothing too groundbreaking. Its enough to fill the booze void and make sure your liver stays in shape. That being said, for $13 or so, I had a lunchtime pint and a meal that filled me to the brim. Awesome.

If I had the energy after eating it, I would have given everybody who worked at Big Mouth a high-five, because it was an accomplishment of culinary goodness that rivals the work of Einstein. Except Einstein never put bacon and a fried egg on a cheeseburger, so he must have been totally stupider. \n\nIf you're going for the first time, don't waste your time reading or thinking...ask for the Hangover Burger, then grab a seat and clear your schedule for the rest of the day, because you've got digestin' to do, buddy-boy. It's a half-pound patty, topped with 'merican cheese (that's how true 'mericans pronounce it) and then topped with an egg fried sunny-side up, but not very runny. Then they throw three strips of crispy, awesome bacon on top of that. There's some spicy chipotle mayo involved too, but your mouth will be so busy savoring the burger, cheese, egg and bacon that the mayo will be like the ugly girl who showed up to prom by herself and waited in the corner for somebody to ask her to dance. \n\nBig Mouth is a great spot to grab a burger for lunch, the prices are good and if you've been having a few drinks, walk past the cheesesteak place next door (which is also pretty great) and get a Hangover Burger.

Located in the heart, maybe upper right ventricle, of the Mission at 24th and Valencia, it's kinda hard to find unless you're really looking for it.  Found a parking space, not as hard as I thought it would be, and walked in through their small storefront door.  It's a simple, unpretentious and well worn joint with almost no decor other than the often copied permanent chalkboard menu done in color and calligraphy.  There are four red stools in one front window, the kitchen and pay station on the other.  The cooking area is open and it's all compact and easily navigated for such a tiny space.\n\nThe menu is all about burgers, and there are ten varieties plus a Caesar Salad ($5.45) on the menu, but the variety includes their basic Big Mouth, a fresh ground Turkey, a free range chicken breast, thin sliced marinated flank steak, Louisiana Cajun sausage, sliced Pork loin, Eggplant vegetarian, a Garden Burger and their Salmon Burger.  Each of the burgers is offered with a plethora of choices of bread, spreads and cheeses and then there are the sides:  fries, hand cut and the size of Lincoln Logs a kid can barely get his fingers around.  They were perfectly cooked and come with each burger or as side dishes.  \n\nOther things that are enticing to a burger aficionado are the sides which are in addition to the delicious fries are baked beans and a zippy Cole Slaw.  Just below their simple Kid's Menu is a one paragraph list of Beers and Beverages which includes great shakes, malts and floats made to order with our own local Mitchell's Ice Cream, five beers on tap and a handful of bottled varieties and soda's and juices.\n\nThis is one of the best burger joints in San Francisco and if you like them a fraction as much as I do, then make sure you make a beeline over to Big Mouth, a true burger emporium of distinction and aplomb.", "author": "Stu S."}

While he had a brilliant engineering mind, his social skills were (cough) lacking. We would sit in stunned silence as we watched him eat all of his french fries before devouring his cheeseburger in a total of 2 minutes. He also had a habit of placing his hand in his pants among casual company. We didn't see it as an act of perversion; it was just his way of telling us he felt comfortable. Among our group of computer nerds, fondling your twig and berries publicly wasn't discouraged. I think he is now a professor of computer science at an esteemed University you would probably know of. Be afraid, be very afraid.\n\nBut overall, he was a nice kid and would LOVE Big Mouth Burgers if he lived in SF. It is comfort food prepared exceptionally well. I often think about my old friend as I sip a corona with a perfect blue cheese burger and fries. It's the good stuff.\n\nIn fact, I think I'll give him a call to see what's new.

I made my own burger of sorts (Jack cheese, spicy chipotle mayo on french bread) and the rest of the team tried the Hawaiian burger (teriyaki sauce and pineapple), the blue burger and other variations on the Big Mouth.  The only reason we didn't clean our plates was because the burgers are so massive (and even then, some of us finished).  Fries are thick cut, skin on and very tasty.  Onion rings are solid, but the onion-ring ratio needs some work (a thicker onion would be more satisfying).\n\nI really like the options Big Mouth offers in terms of topping and bread.

Forget the Persian carpet, I wanna reasonably priced \"good\" burger\n\nToday, I found the Holy Grail burger -- a 2007 blue cheese burger for $7.40 made with natural ground chuck \"without hormones, antibiotics, insecticides or chemical residues\" (so their to-go menu says) that comes with a good-sized order of fresh but french fries. \n\nThe burger came medium.

They deserve all the reviews that call them one of the best burgers in the bay--every bit as good as Barney's and Burgermeister.\n\nWHAT EARNS THE 5th STAR is their new \"Chevap\" sandwich - this is an anglicized spelling of Bosnia's famed Cevapi.  Spiced skinless thumb-sized sausages with onions served in a ciabatta.  My recommendation for eating it is not to bring the whole thing to your mouth like a burger, but to use your fingers or a fork to eat the sausages and tear off hunks of bread (which is slightly soggy from the grease...mmmmm....).  That's how they do it in Sarajevo and Banja Luka.  And my friends: IT IS DELICIOUS.\n\nWith my first bite, i was transported back to the Bascarsija district of Sarajevo, with minarets overhead and the sound of coppersmiths ringing down the cobblestone streets, and the rich smell of chevapi wafting from every corner. Big Mouth's Chevap sandwich isn't as good as that, but it's a close second, and to my knowledge, they're the only people in San Francisco with this sandwich.\n\nTo be fair, they should serve it in a thick pita-like bread, and a simple cucumber and tomato salad would be a nice side (i recommend the coleslaw as a side for this - fries are too much, the grease-soaked ciabatta is enough).

At half the price I would expect this though. At Joes they just use finer meat and cook to order, at Big Mouth a burger is a burger (and I must say mine was too well done). The buns and the supporting leafage is comparable at both places.  \n\nFries:\nThe fries at Joes are really good. Not too dry not too greasy. True they dont come with your $10 burger but they are superior to the Big Mouth Burger fries (which are included in your $7 burger). \n\nService:\nJoes wins. Big Mouth Burger is a dump and my cashier girl was a ditz. She forgot my girlfriends shake until we were both nearly finished with our meal. \n\nDecor:\nJoes - clean but cheesy, Big Mouth - gnarly and nasty grungorama.\n\nBottom Line:\nJoes is so far the best burger I've had.

I read a review calling the Joes patty \"loose\" and I think thats right on in a really tasty way. \n\nBig Mouth is nothing special really, the burger was ho hum IMO.

This place was named Big Mouth since at least three years before the Big Mouth brawl with Chili's, who has since sued the owner for trademark infringement.  So the owner apparently changed the name to \"Mega Mouth Burgers\", which is how it usually shows up on the internet, and told Chili's that if they want the signs changed, they should come and do it themselves! ha! take that multi-national corp!

(no, i promise i won't go off on a \"well, back in my day\" story...)\n\nthe burgers are great, cooked to order, and fully customizable. or you can order from their menu of specialty burgers. i prefer a simple cheddar burger on french roll. the fries are a little \"iffy\", but with some extra ketchup they do just fine. they're thick-cut fries and tend to be a little undercooked.\n\ntaking all of that into consideration, the last best thing about this place is its location. it's close to BART, which not only means you can catch your train whenever you want, but it also means this is a great spot to people watch. i like to sit in the window and make faces at everyone that passes.", "author": "Jeremiah W."}

Let me warn every one to take note of the DATE of the review. The very first review tells you  that a Big Mouth Burger is priced at $6, well according to the employee ( with the personality of a door knob)  who hand wrote me my receipt, I paid $8.71; thats almost 30% more folks. Furthermore, according to the aforementioned autographed hand  written souvenir, the burger, onion rings and a milkshake, total, out the door : $17.37.\n\n For Yelp to give Big Mouth their lowest 'Price Range' rating of  ' $ ' seems totally absurd. I don't know about you, but that's a lot of money for when your just planning on running out for a quick burger fix. If I knew I was going to get screwed, I would have at least showered and shaved.\n\nThe food was certainly edible, even though no one asked how I wanted my burger cooked or what kind of bread I wanted, ' spread\", etc., ( but then, I was only the virgin customer). Yes there was a sufficient amount of grub, except for the 12 oz. milkshake @ $4.33.\n\nThis experience certainly makes me a bit leery about putting any reliability in anyones Yelps reviews. Frankly, I feel I could have found better value for the money at other burger joints like, In and Out, or Nations, or Burgermeister, or . . .\nCan you tell from my review when it will be I'll be going back for more ?

This was 2-3 weeks ago, I went in and specifically ordered a cheeseburger with nothing but cheese on it. The pretty cashier who took my order understood what i asked for, she repeated it back to me. And the cook seemed to understand when he said cheeseburger just cheese. So I walked back home 8 blocks and I was in my room ready to eat and the burger had everything on it. Mayo and lettuce and other fun stuff that I did not order. So I calmly called to explain the situation and the young lady who answered understood and said if I came back they would remake it and it would be 15 minutes. So I walked with the wrong order in hand and got back to this location. The cashier said I could keep the original order which I threw out in the restaurant's trash and at the time I did not think of a homeless person who might want the original burger, sorry i was mad and not thinking about it. But I walked home again and they made the order correctly for the most part, except they burned it. I thought to myself, just eat the damn burger and don't go back there, I didn't even bother to call them to say they messed up again. And I have not been back since, I think their only saving grace is the nice cashier order taking girl, since I don't know her official title, maybe manager.

One down side of BMB's location is the Christian church across the street.  As I was looking for parking it occurred to me that Jesus-freaks have such little regard for everyone else that they have to fuck up everyone's Friday night parking so they can grovel.

I decided to get a little creative and try the Texan--a pulled pork sandwich with BBQ sauce.\n\nSounds good, right? Well we picked up the food for takeout, and upon arriving home the first sign of trouble appeared in the form of a watery meat-juice dripping from the wrapped sandwich as I lifted it from the paper bag. I unwrapped the sandwich only to find it SWIMMING in a half-inch of liquid. Like, I wondered for a second if I had ordered pulled pork SOUP. The bottom bun was soaked through, soggy and completely inedible. Couldn't even pick up the sandwich without it disintegrating in my hand. Luckily the top bun had survived the flood, and the meat filling was okay. Kind of plain with not enough spice/barbeque sauce, but enough so I didn't have to go hungry.\n\nStill, you can see how this sandwich was a major disappointment.

With the grilled onions on top, the burger itself tasted a little more greasy than is my preference. \nToppings: The cheddar was plentiful, but didn't have the bite that I look for it to add to the burger. The grilled onions were good, but oily. \nThe bun: White bread. Held up fine. Nothing special.\nSides: The pickles were quite fresh and good. Liked the pickle slices. The fries were super crispy (without asking) which I love. These are thick cut fries, which are not my favorite. But I ate most of them all the same... which says something.\nFinal Thoughts: I think at a higher price point, there are other burger options in SF (refer to my burger list) that would get you a better burger. In this category of high end burger joints though,  I would only put Pearls and their 7$ burger above this one. Certainly a good and decent burger, however.", "author": "Matt C."}

If your in the area and need a quick bite to eat this place is an option, not a must go though.", "author": "THE REAL K."}

I get cravings for their salmon burger on toasted whole wheat bun.  Juicy, fresh, never \"fishy\" tasting.  Ask for the mango salsa on top - heavenly.  I was less excited about their eggplant and grilled red pepper on focaccia, however - a bit too oily.  Caesar salad is pretty tame, as is the cole slaw, but I have to agree with the others about the fries.  Mmm.  Super friendly staff as well.  However, the best thing by far about this place is that huge yawning toothy mouth of a logo.  Brilliant.", "author": "Esther K."}

So today I told myself to go in. When I walked in I had an odd sensation that I was bothering the cashier. Oh well, maybe the food will be good. Now I don't know about you, but I'm pretty picky about my burgers and I would put this in the same category as the six dollar burger from carls jr. The meat is overcooked, the buns are cheap and flavorless, and the whole atmosphere of the place isn't too inviting. Go somewhere else, like Chez Maman, for a good burger.", "author": "Robbie L."}

I wish they made the patties plumper, not flat and wide (probably for easier cooking) I had ordered the hamburger with chortle mayo with Monterrey jack. It was pretty good. I would avoid the cheese so I could enjoyed the full meat taste. It came with cut fries with skin on!", "author": "S.K. Y."}

I think mine was smothered in blue cheese and mushrooms or something. It was tastey, as were the fries. And the name is accurate, because the burgers are quite large. We did take-out and the restaurant isn't high on atmosphere, but there is some seating. The lady at the counter was very nice and the service is pretty quick. Definitely a good place to satisfy a burger craving.", "author": "Caitlin H."}

It's retardedly over priced and the burgers just aren't that great. If I go there (and it's always someone else's idea) I'll get a burger with nothing, take it home and put my own god damn fixings on it. It's like 3 dollars cheaper and what I have it home is probably more fresh anyway. I'll also say that their onion rings and fries BLOW. There is a tini tiny sliver and I am pretty sure that they are frozen. Did I mention that the girl who was working the cash register last time I went there was a boring, sort of bitchy character? If I'm going to pay 10 bucks for a god damn burger, I want my meal served with a god damn smile and a 'have a nice day'. In short, this place blows, walk to Burger Joint right down Valencia, they are pricey but have better burgers or just go to McDonalds down 24th, you can get 2 burgers and a sundae and a soft drink for the price of one f-ing burger at Big Mouth.", "author": "Alexandra F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2005-11-08", "description": "Another great find.  Standard burgers cost less than $6, but add 95 cents each for cheese, bacon, avocado, etc.  You can choose your bread, such as foccacia, regular bun, french roll ... and your spread ... like pesto!!!!, spicy mayo, BBQ and others.  They also serve a few other sandwiches, like chicken, steak, sausage, and a blue cheese burger that sounds great (and seems to sell pretty well) served with pesto aioil.  Fries are included, and are really great.  Instead of fries, you can have beans or cole slaw,  for you carb watchers  The slaw is pretty good, but needs more pepper and horseradish.  I like a good, nasal clearing slaw.  They also have a passalbe caeser salad.  It's a great deal, at about  $6, for a plain, no frills burger.  The place could use a good scrubbing though ... the counter and tables were a bit sticky.  There is something for everybody, even a garden burger.  But the TV selection has to go.  For some reason, I found myself watching the Comcast info channel.  Not the first time it's been on either!", "author": "Michael M."}
