Finally got a chance to try it out when we got it for an office happy hour!\n\nMmm, unfortunately I'll have to agree with other reviewers that the food is could have used some more flavor. \n\nThe chips and guac were pretty standard. The guac was definitely tasty, though I wouldn't have complained about some more salt and spice. It wasn't too creamy but I liked the cilantro pieces in this.\n\nNext up, empanadas and flautas de pollo. The empanadas had a soft exterior with chicken, chorizo, and Menonita cheese filling. Tasty enough. The flautas were filled with chicken tinga (chicken in tomato and chipotle sauce) and topped with salsa verde, queso fresco, and crema. These just reminded me of the taquitos I used to heat up in the microwave as a kid. The crust was a little hard.\n\nEnchiladas! We got the suizas enchilada and the mestiza enchilada. I suppose these definitely fell into the category of comfort food. The suiza enchilada was also chicken tinga with a creamy tomatillo sauce. The mestiza enchilada had chipotle-braised beef with mestiza sauce (which is reddish-brown, but also made with tomatillo. While these things are different colors, they tasted similar to me.\n\nFinally, onto some cheese quesadillas. The cheese in these was pretty tasty, and the salsas weren't too spicy.\n\nOverall though, it just felt like the same ingredients were used in different ways (based on what we ordered), whereas some variety would have been appreciated.", "author": "Nicole H."}

This was my first time going, so naturally I had no idea what to expect. \n\nImmediately the first thing I noticed was the decor. The restaurant is set up in a way I think Bobby Berk from Queer Eye, you know the one who flips houses, would appreciate. \n\nNow it is time for the food. I first started out with ceviche, which I was swimming in it. The guacamole was so thick and creamy I wanted to rub it all over my body; you know millennials and guac. Since it was a lunch date and Friday I didn't want to gorge myself with food. I had people to impress later on that night. So I orders some tacos, and let me just say the tacos and I had a moment. As I was sitting there eating some juicy meat, I couldn't help but wonder... what would be the icing on top of a fantastic lunch? Oh yes, a frozen pomegranate margarita. \n\nYou know that feeling you get when a cutie at a bar approaches you. Well, this was so much better then that!", "author": "Carlos M."}

I've been here quite a few times, and I'm always left feeling... unsatisfied.\n\nPros- great space for events, nice ambience, helpful and friendly staff, some (side) dishes are delish\n\nCons- the food in general is just not up to par. This past time I was there, I ordered the veggie \"fajitas.\" I am a huge cauliflower, kale, and corn lover, all parts of this dish. It was disgusting. The cauliflower was uncooked, chewy, and had a gross spice on it. We all agreed that is was really not good. The rest of my dish was so incredibly bland and boring. I feel bad for actual vegetarians dining here!\n\nOther dishes were just not great. I've tried a variety of entrees here, and never really loved anything. For $25-$30 per plate, please step it up. I mean this is ridiculous.\n\nDrinks are also extremely overpriced, even for San Francisco. A $17 margarita? Come on.\n\nSo yeah, average at best.

The hostess was not friendly AT ALL which is not a good look since that's the first person customers interact with. She was very dismissive rather than helpful. Outdoor seating was open seating so we sat ourselves and pushed some tables together. Our waiter was accommodating which lightened the experience. Their happy hour menu was limited as far as cocktails goes and it wasn't the cheapest (but we are in SF). IMO, no chips and salsa will beat Chevy's, but theirs was okay. \nTheir frozen margs somehow seemed a lot stronger than on the rocks. I loved how their fruity margs were not overly sweet and they had chunks of actual fruit in it. Their fish tacos was on the fishy side and the batter was thick (not on my top fish taco list). \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to go to this place again. If you're driving into the city, parking is limited. It's more ideal for people who want to grab a drink and walk over after work or something.

We were seated immediately (yay for reservations!) and from there service went downhill. The wait for our drinks, food, general service felt absurdly long. Between taking orders to receiving our drinks that took about 20 min. The time between our drinks to our food, felt like forever. Long enough that we were wondering what happened and definitely long enough that one my coworkers who had to leave at 1:30pm (we arrived at 12pm) did not get her food. By 1pm the restaurant had cleared out and there were only a few tables left so we didn't understand why the food took so long. I understand they serving a big group takes longer but I felt like this took too long overall.\n\nAside from the service, the food was okay. I loved the chips and guacamole!

Food and drink was complimentary, and set up as a buffet plus passed appetizers in the bar area.\n\nThe space is very cool, and the staff was friendly and attentive. Although I didn't notice much after I spotted the largest bowl of guacamole I had ever seen in my life, served up in a giant stone molcajete. It took all my willpower not to just hover over it, scooping giant mounds of the stuff directly into my face. Instead, I made like an adult and sat down to enjoy a few Negra Modelos, the quesadilla buffet, the taco bar, and piping hot bites being served up by the staff. These included vegetarian and gluten-free options like spinach quesadillas and potato flautas, which were a welcome sight to some of my colleagues.\n\nBased on what I sampled, I've added it to my list of places to check out for a real meal when in the city with visiting relatives. It wouldn't be a destination restaurant or my choice for authentic Mexican, but is cute and tasty enough to visit again.

Our group had reservations, but when I walked in around 11:45 it wasn't that full. Nevertheless, I would recommend reservations, because why not?\n\nWe started out with two orders of their 'famous tableside guacamole ($15)', which is prepared by their server...you guessed it, tableside. It's an interesting idea, but we were all chatting and catching up and didn't pay much attention to our server, so the novelty of having it prepared tableside was lost on us. As for the guacamole, we all agreed it was on the salty side. And since I personally can't stand cilantro, I had fun picking out all the cilantro out of the guac as I was eating it. And trust me, they put a lot in...\n\nOrdered the fish tacos ($17) for my entree and I was also not particularly impressed. The fish came in big chunks that were a bit dry and not flavored very well, and since I opted not to use their tartar sauce as it was spicy, the whole taco was super bland. There was a bowl of beans that came with someone else's meal on the table, and I started using some of the beans for flavor by the end.\n\nFor how much I paid for this meal, I was very underwhelmed. Would not come back again, but some people at the table seemed to enjoy their food.\n\nService was pretty good. Our server came to check up on us frequently enough.", "author": "Dianna H."}

The umbrellas are big enough that they provide lot of shade.  The walking areas were a bit narrow so you had to watch where you were walking.  Inside looked decently lit with large windows though the sunny day may have helped with that.\n\nService: generally was good; slightly slower than I'm used too but not so bad that we had to wave the staff down.  Did take us a while to get our drinks/ water but food came out relatively quickly.  They'll check in once or twice during the meal to make sure you don't need anything.\n\nFood:  interesting how they have 3 different menus for lunch; regular, gluten-free, and vegetarian.  Was in awe at how much variety there was on the gluten-free and vegetarian menus (huge plus for those with dietary restrictions).  \n- Queso Fundido ($11.50) - sooooooo good if you are a cheese lover!  Definitely a shared dish for 4+ people though, especially if you are thinking of ordering something else\n- Pescado a la Parilla tacos ($17) - they give you three tacos and esquites on the side (corn with cheese and chili of some sort).  The corn was tasty but slightly spicy for my liking.  The corn tortillas (one per taco) were nice and supple, but not so thin that it would break apart while eating.  The jalapeno tartar sauce had a strong kick, but unfortunately the grilled fish itself was severely under-seasoned that the whole dish tasted bland, even with the tartar sauce.  It definitely needed salt to drive the flavors forward, especially when the bland fish rested on top of cabbage which... let's face it... doesn't taste like much when raw.  \n- White sangria ($9 for a glass) - was kinda disappointed with this one, because the overall feeling of drinking it was kinda heavy and stickingly sweet at the back of my throat (not the best thing on a warm day).  Also didn't help that there was a lot of triple sec / apricot brandy in it which, when mixed with cucumber, made it a bit bitter in the aftertaste in my opinion.  \n\nNot the best Mexican I've ever eaten, but definitely not the worst.

My roast pork chamorro was cooked fine, but lacked any seasoning.  That might have been okay with some hot sauce, but of course, my waiter never brought any.  My Allende white ale ($10!!) was advertised as being on tap, but came in a bottle.  The guacamole was actually pretty flavorful, but we didn't get very much of it for $16, and despite asking us how spicy we wanted it (\"very spicy\"), there was literally zero spice in the guac.\n\nService was just awful.  Food took over an hour to arrive, and was supposed to come with fresh corn tortillas, but of course, came with none.  Our waiter took our order and never came around again -- we had to walk around the restaurant to hunt him down to ask for tortillas and hot sauce, which he completely ignored.  When it came time to pay, we had to hunt our waiter down a second time just to get the check.  \n\nSF has plenty of overpriced Mexican food, but it tends to be tasty.

The tortillas themselves tasted like those you can buy from grocery stores.\n\nI had pretty high expectations since this is a restaurant and it looked classy.

The main dishes aren't as good as their Mission equivalents, are much pricier and take an unreasonably long time to prepare (about an hour when ordered at noon).  You're probably better off coming here for Happy Hour drinks and snacks (which they do well) and then hopping on the BART to the Mission for dinner.\n\nGuacamole en Molcajete: You can't go to Rosa Mexicano and miss the guacamole made table-side (or, table-adjacent, in our case).  Not pasty like that pre-made green goo you pay extra for at Chipotle.  The chips are warm, thick and crunchy.  Also, the chipotle and tomatillo salsas provided a nice \"light\" bite between heaps of guacamole.  The only unfortunate side effect is that you can get pretty filled up and not finish your main.\n\nCarnitas: I liked the idea of assembling my own taco from meat on a cast iron skillet.  Kinda like a bougie take on Chili's fajitas.  Unfortunately, it didn't come out sizzling.  In fact, the pork and pineapple felt lukewarm.  The carnitas themselves weren't crispy enough for my liking.  In the hole-in-the-wall taquerias in the Mission, the pork seems longer and thinner and crispier all over.  Also, the tortilla-to-filling ratio was way too low.  I still had half my skillet left once I rolled my four tacos.  And they seemed a bit skimpy on the salsas and sour cream too.", "author": "Adam B."}

Hint: if it's yellow, thin, forms a skin after a while or otherwise stays liquid, it ain't queso fundido! It's nacho cheese. It may have previously resided in a can. On a shelf. At a warehouse club.)\n\nAlso, the made-at-your-table guacamole is really good. When they ask if you want it spicy, be prepared for *spicy* (another oddity is how many restaurants interpret \"spicy\" as \"somewhat hot\"... there's no grade inflation here when it comes to Scoville units.)\n\nFinally, the three enchilada plate is commendable and satisfying (the mole sauce is excellent).\n\nI'm not a fan of fish so I can't speak to that, but as a rare place that's both tasty and has real queso fundido I'm quite pleased with it.", "author": "Marty F."}

The decor is beautiful, especially the water that flows down the wall over the tile which reminds me of abalone shell.  The Mexican music playing over the sound system was not too loud and very upbeat.  Everyone that served us was very friendly, attentive and helpful, especially the gentleman that took our order.  The free salsa and chips were tasty and fresh.  We ordered the guacamole which came in a dark stone container that reminded me of a Mayan artifact.  Definitely one of the best guacamoles I've ever had.  You can request different levels of spiciness.  They brought us samples of the enchilada sauces to taste.  They were all good, but the mole was exceptional.  I've had it before at other places and never liked it, but Rosa's version was amazing and changed my opinion on mole sauce.\n\nUnfortunately, I was already too full to order as much as I would like, but my friend ordered the three enchiladas and loved them.  I ordered the Sopa de Tortilla and it was unlike any other I've ever had and I mean that in a good way.  The chicken was mouth-watering and flavorful, the broth was divine--darker than I've seen before, and there was a slice of avocado in the toppings.  You could taste the Chef's pride in everything.  \n\nYes, it's a bit more expensive than some places, but it's in the financial district and rents are high.  We felt the price was worth it since the service was top notch and everything tasted wonderful.  You can tell by the flavor that they put a lot of effort into the preparation.\n\nMy friend liked Rosa's so much that it's now her favorite Mexican restaurant, leapfrogging to the top of the list past another restaurant she has liked for years!  She said, \"All food was fantastic and the service was first class.\"  We were told that there had been some issues there before, but they have a new manager and changes have been implemented.

Luckily, one of my gfs said she'd help me drink it. It was smooth and fruity with a little slight alcoholic punch. The rest of our party had wine.

It's prepared tableside which I adored since we could tell them the spice level we wanted. I love everything super spicy, but some in our party can't handle spice. I ended up getting a side of jalapenos so I could add some to the guac as I was eating it. I got the flauntas which were just eh. I felt like there was too much going on in terms of toppings and sauce. It was crunchy, but I wanted more flavor from the chicken. The enjoyed the elote I ordered. The corn was cooked nicely for me.

It was great! The staff was friendly and engaging. The staff never missed a moment to make the evenings special. Order time takes a while, but it was no problem for us, as the drinks kept us occupied. I really like their Braised Beef Brisket Tacos (they are a million times better than the tacos other restaurants have on their menu). The Guacamole is served in a large bowl, and is big enough for 3 or 4 people.  I always order it to get something fast while I wait for the main course (they also have chips and salsa but I try to avoid them because they seem to be high in calories).

When it came to dinner for two with three drinks in between my girlfriend and I, we paid $150 altogether. A little twinge, but we had a great time, and the food and service were fantastic. $16 for table-made guacamole is a little steep, but it's a show, and the guac is fantastic and well-seasoned. It also comes in a traditional mortar and pestle. What else is good? All of their drinks are about 75% alcohol, so if you're looking for a strong, stiff fix, this is the place. The fish tacos come in threes, and they're really, really good, but my personal favorite was the carnitas. You get freshly made, warm tortillas to go with a large tray of delectable pork and pineapples. You would think the interplay between the large tropic fruit chunks (grilled, by the way) and shredded pork would be a little strange, but it's absolutely fantastic. You also get a tray of 2 salsas and sour cream as adornments. Really good stuff. Would love to come back and eat and drink on the patio.", "author": "Danny C."}

Well service was friendly, but they were super slammed with Super Bowl City visitors on the Saturday night before the Super Bowl.  So our dinner party was a very long 4.5 hours.  I felt like our main waiter provided great service though.\n\nLet me start by saying their guacamole was like crack!  It's addicting with their tortilla chips!  The guacamole is so fresh and creamy and has a spicy kick to it.  Since we were a large party of 30, we had a set pre fixe (we just had to choose which entree we wanted).  I got a sampling of a few of the appetizers which included the chicken flautas and the beef quesadilla.  Quesadilla was standard to me, but I enjoyed the crispy chicken tinga flautas topped with fresh crema, salsa verde and cheese.  Also sampled the quesadlias de res, which was filled with cheese and braised beef.  \n\nMy husband and I both chose for our entree the Tampiquena de carne asada which was a grilled flank steak.  It was marinated in chile and tequila and was so tender, and medium rare!  Accompanying it was some guacamole, crema and a tortilla with cheese (i.e. almost like an enchilada) and covered with a tomato sauce.  Last up was the dessert, which we all thought was going to be bomb, but was a bit of a disappointment.  The little churros weren't served piping hot, and they were a little stale.  They were served with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  \n\nAgain, we did take awhile to get started, but about 4.5 hours for dinner was so long!  I felt that the staff could have took our entree orders once they started passing out the appetizers (which was when everyone got there).   They were very busy due to Alicia Key's performance at Super Bowl City, but, nonetheless, I don't think this should have contributed too much to such a long dinner.  Though, again,o ur main waiter was wonderful!  BTW, I heard the bathrooms were absolutely disgusting that night.

Especially on beautiful fall days, their outdoor patio suites the needs of a cool venue within walking distance to the North FiDi area and great food for an even better value.

The gentleman serving up drinks and information at the Variety Club Preview Room suggested Rosa Mexicano.\n\nWell... it was a walk, but we made it and I, for one, was starving! We arrived around 10:00 and they were open until 11:00. \n\nWe started off with the guacamole. It was super fresh and chunky. I love avocado, so the roughly diced deliciousness in the stone bowl suited me just fine. The wooden spoon was a little awkward. It was thick and dishing up the guacamole was tricky. Still, it was very good.\n\nThere were many options, from tacos to enchiladas and many specials. I was torn, but ended up with the Tres Enchiladas, chicken, beef and cheese. The Chihuahua cheese enchilada was fantastic! The sauce and the cheese!! After tasting all three, I left the cheese enchilada for last so I could savor the flavor. The chicken and beef enchiladas were tasty. Not as extraordinary as the cheese, but good.\n\nThe place is gorgeous. Kudos to the design team. The full-wall diving waterfall was interesting and soothing. Everything seems very high end. The red, orange and black color scheme was a treat. I believe the impact of the decor was greater because it was dark out.\n\nStaff was very helpful and attentive. Water was filled regularly.\n\nIf we ever go back I'd like to try one of their specials.", "author": "Scott N."}

Since our musical heroes at the time were Madonna and Michael Jackson with a twinge of Earth Wind and Fire and Blondie, we all decided to meet sensibly downtown for everyone to get to easily.  It was easy, and yet if you are a driver like I am, well, it took some time to get parking.....\n\nLocation - Ground floor of the Spear One tower across from Rincon Annex.  Outdoor seating for when the weather is just right and plenty of space for all different size parties.\n\nThe Menu - Interesting American style Mexican Food.  You can easily browse it online.   From the appetizers, to the Enchiladas, to the specialities, I found the menu to be about par for your typical Americanized fare.\n\nWhat impressed me:  Guacamole - They serve guacamole at your table and it is very good. A bit overly large in terms of chunkiness, but overall very tasty. They don't serve you a lot of tortilla's with the guac, and maybe that is good so you don't too filled up on the appetizer...  The next thing that impressed me was the Chamorro!  This hunking piece of pork shank is cooked in the style the German Schweinhaxe.  So you get this huge peace of port that is charred on the outside and tender on the inside.  It is a fantastic barbaric experience to eat this piece of meat.\n\nTookillya - The tequila selection here is amazing.  Going from your 10.00 per shot to the triple digits.  The Gran Centenario Anejo is what I had and it was a reasonable 15.00 per shot.  \n\nOverall - Decent service, we were ten and I liked that they did not gratuitously add the tip onto the bill already. Yep we left a larger tip in this case.  Filling the water up came slowly however I liked the place.  I think this is a better lunch place, and if they want to be busier on week nights, they will need to liven up the place with happy hours, food choices that are lighter or more authentic and make it a destination place to eat.\n\nI liked it, however not sure if I would go out of my way to come back.", "author": "Greg K."}

I've been wanting to check it out since it opened. Not sure what this place used to be and none of my friends who work in the area could tell me either. The turnover for restaurants in SF is just too high! A lot of the poor reviews I'm seeing are from 2013 so I can only assume this place has taken the complaints into account and stepped their game up. \n\nArrived at 5:15 on a Monday for happy hour and found a seat at the bar. Well I found the little seat next to the salsa station and my friend was having none of it when he saw me at the little bar so we moved to a table by the window. Service was super attentive with two of the bartenders asking if I was ready to order and water right at my table. When we were seated at the table there was instant water for my friend and complimentary chips and salsa for us! \n\nI hadn't planned on eating since I already had enchiladas and black beans for lunch but my friend was hungry and ordered three of the $5 dishes off the happy hour menu. I got the pepper quesadilla and it was bomb! Shared it with my other buddy who arrived later and three dishes was plenty of food for the three of us. \n\nThis restaurant is HUGE! Didn't realize until I went to the restroom in the back of the place. I think there was some company happy hour going on in the back. They have an awesome fountain wall installation that I was glad I was able to check out. Its huge but easily missed if you just sit at the bar the entire time. \n\nUnder $50 for three appetizers, four drinks, and chips and salsa. Done deal!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-04-28", "description": "While in town for business a friend and I grabbed dinner here. We had an enjoyable meal.\n\nD\u00e9cor: Both outside and inside this is a more upscale Mexican restaurant. It still \"feels\" like a Mexican restaurant but everything is nicer and very well taken care of. There is a bar area, which was packed when we were there (on a Thursday night) and then a very large dining room that had ample amount of tables and booths. Additionally, it appear that there were a few \"private\" rooms/areas (they were really just behind a curtain) where private parties were being held. The lights are kept low to keep a more low-key and intimate vibe but everyone, including ourselves, were having a great (loud) time!\nBathroom: clean, mood-lit, and inviting\n\nStaff: The hostess seated us right away and our waiter took very good care of us (despite us taking FOREVER to order anything!). He was patient, understanding, and totally chill. Additionally, the bus boys cleared away any dirty dishes promptly and always kept our water glasses filled. Great service.\n\nFood/Drinks: We started with a few beers, Coronas of course, and then moved on to some tableside-made guacamole. They made it to taste and it was delicious! We then ordered, and enjoyed, our entrees: we both had enchiladas and they were tasty. We had both the Suizas (tasty) and the Tres Enchiladas (ranchera, suiza, mestiza) (yum). They came with sides of rice and beans, standard, and those were also very enjoyable. The portions are pretty sizable and after all the chips we ate we were certainly stuffed!\n\nValue: This is a nicer place and located near the water so it commands a bit higher of a price. However, we greatly enjoyed the entire meal and I do not feel like we didn't receive the level of service deserved.\n\nThis is a solid Mexican food restaurant that I will be recommending to friends and look forward to returning to again in the future.", "author": "Mark B."}

Make it a Son Jalisco please, for the Mexican state where tequila was invented in the 16th century. Bartender, snifters of Herradura Selecion Suprema for everyone! I have a story to tell. It's a tale of two Rosas. Take a sip of that extra a\u00f1ejo magic in a glass and savor the story.\n\nPrimero, la historia de Rosa muy casual. She is an excellent Happy Hour option for the downtowner. Great patio seating - good thing they have plenty heat lamps 'cause there aren't that many truly warm days and eves in ess-eff. There's also an 8-seat bar (with sports on TV) and a good number of tall tables. Best of all, the price is right. Rosa casual isn't quite a cheap date, but she's a good deal - daily, 4-7. Happy hour-seeker please note, it's part of a chain, so don't expect a nabe-Mexican restaurant vibe. Instead, it feels slighty swanky, but pleasantly casual. Good vibes. A fun place to get your date on or hang with friends. \n\nSegundo, la historia de Rosa mas formal. She is good for lunch meetings and expense account dinners. This would be a go-to if it were closer to the office. The large, L-shaped dining area is nicely appointed. Large enough that you might be able to get in without a reservation, Appropriate for the business lunch and in no way reminiscent of the taco truck. Rosa formal ain't cheap though. She's not that kind of girl.\n\nLa comida -  keep sipping if you will, while I tell you about the food. Happy hour first. Dos tacos, for just $6, is the way to go. I highly recommend the camarones - shrimp, kale and chipotle aioli. Pollo is good too - cheesy grilled chicken with bacon. Tinga de Res is just OK - beef brisket with salsa, slaw and pickled onion. Quesadillas at $6 are the other best bet and easy to share. They have Pollo and Tinga de Res (see above), as well as Rajas - a vegetarian option with poblano chile strips. Margarita are just $7 per glass or $30 a pitcher. Good prices on sangria, vino and cerveza too. The other bar fave is never discounted but always worth it, the Queso Fundido - I'm drooling thinking of it - a melty dish of cheese and poblanos with handmade corn tortillas - kind of a Mexican fondue. It would be easy to share, but you'll want it all for yourself. Order two and you won't look as greedy! \n\nNo matter where you sit, you'll love the made-in-front-of-you guacamole. Though it's not such a large serving, it's soooo good. So pay the $15 for the experience before your eyes and in your mouth. The regular lunch and dinner menus have always satisfied me. Shrimp ceviche, Mexican Casar salad and enchiladas are all good. Elotes - Mexican street corn in a nice change of pace, especially if you're here as a tourist from beyond California's borders. Try it at least once... \n\nBebidas - at the bottom of the review, but the real reason I love to visit Rosa. Perfect for a good time with friends. The house margaritas are pretty good. They're $12 if it's not happy hour (see above). I like La Unica, their version of a Cadillac margarita with 1800 reposado tequila and Grand Marnier. Meanwhile, I wouldn't go there, but a tequila-lovin' friend of mine likes the pomegranite margies. They even have skinny margaritas - I guess that's how Rosa keeps her fine figure.\n\nIf it's a special occasion, or just a regular occasion you'd like to make special, check out the top-of-the-top-shelf a\u00f1ejo tequilas to order in a snifter in my order of preference (taste vary but these are all worth trying): \nHerradura Selecion Suprema \nReserva de la Familia\nDon Julio 1942\nEl Tesoro Paradiso - extra a\u00f1ejo \nCasa Noble 5-year\nFortaleza \nPartida \nOcho\nTapatillo\nGran Centenario\nChinaco\nDon Julio\nPueblo Viejo\nChamucos\n\nY mas - other details: Gluten-free menus available if you need one. Noise level varies. \n\nIt's highly debated in the Yelp reviews, but I've always had reasonably good service. Yes, it can be slow when the place is packed. Um, that's true pretty much true everywhere in the known universe. At least they're never unfriendly. Shout out to the bartender who saw empty glasses on our table after he had clocked out and he still came over and took our order. \n\nIf you're driving, it may be hard to find parking. Some spots become available at 6pm, but you better show up by 5:55 to get one. It's pretty convenient to the Embarcadero Station for BART and Muni access - so don't drive and you can have one for the road!\n\nEl total - five stars for the happy hour and excellent tequila selection ('cause did you read the review?), three stars for lunch and dinner (good food, but pricey) - I'll give Rosa four stars overall and will keep meeting friends here for HH.", "author": "Ted R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-15", "description": "Is Rosa Mexicano the name of a wronged woman in a Quentin Tarantino spaghetti western, the one with the permanent sneer and the lazy eye who seeks revenge on the nameless man she fell desperately in love with when she was working at a bordertown bordello? OK, that has nothing to do with this place as this Rosa Mexicano is part of an international chain of upscale restaurants that put a fashion-forward twist on familiar Mexican dishes. That's my euphemistic way of saying this is no Mission taqueria with combination plates. For example, Slow-Braised Short Ribs (Tablones) are $28, and even Beef Enchiladas are $21. This stylish place is not for the budget conscious. That may account for the predominance of suits with presumably hefty expense accounts.\n\nAnd that is likely the reason Jamie W. and I have yet to make it into the dining room. However, I have now been twice to the bar and have been rather mixed in my feelings much like the other conflicted Rosa. We came here the first time the night there was an opening celebration for the Bay Lights. Despite the number of revelers in the bar (photo: http://bit.ly/10XxjVW), we landed at a small table where we ordered the $7.50 Ice Cream Sundae, the proceeds of which go to Alex's Lemonade Stand, which raises money to fight childhood cancer. Not only was this a great charitable move by the restaurant, the dessert was actually decadently good. It consisted of scoops of vanilla ice cream ladled with raspberry-guajillo and piloncillo-espresso chocolate sauces and topped with fresh strawberries and cinnamon sugar plantains (photo: http://bit.ly/13LWE99).\n\nI came back solo weeks later for lunch, this time for the $13 Cobb Salad, a south-of-the-border rendition of the classic that combined chorizo sausage with grilled chicken and added Cabrales blue cheese, avocado, cherry tomatoes, and habanero-pickled onions to the mix. All of those sharp, jagged flavors covered a salad of mixed greens already doused in avocado-dill dressing and topped with chile-dusted croutons (photo: http://bit.ly/13LWIWj). The result was too spicy for my taste to the point of me precariously avoiding certain ingredients with my fork. It was challenging for a full-gusto eater like me to pick at a salad. Perhaps when I get an asbestos tongue and a permanent sneer, I'll come back for an actual dinner here.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...nice sundae surprise but a way-too-spicy Cobb salad\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...big, spacious, upscale and full of suits...the anti-Mission Mexican restaurant\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...nice if a bit unctuous the first time, perfunctory and curt at lunch\nTOTAL - 3 stars...with all the choices in the Mission and even Colibri offering alternatives, this Rosa Mexicano better walk away from the gunfight", "author": "Ed U."}

I have decided to come out of my Yelp retirement with a review on my favorite Happy Hour spot in the City. Since my move to SF, I've been looking for new go-tos. Although I had been to Rosa Mexicano in West Hollywood, it wasn't until my SF friends took me here that I realized how amazing it is.\n\nHappy Hour specials generally fall in one of two categories - cheap food or cheap drinks. Luckily, Rosa has both and it's done with class.\n\nI had never been a big drinks person, probably because I don't love how alcohol tastes. The Frozen Mango Margarita ($6) here is so yummy and you can barely taste the alcohol but don't be fooled, it is strong. You will feel it after one and get a nice buzz after two. If you're brave enough to go for three, get ready for a long nap afterward.\n\nIn addition to the wonderful drink specials, I love the empanadas, tacos, and nachos. Benji (the corgi) also appreciates the outdoor seating, where Happy Hour is also available.\n\nI'm not sure how the dinner menu is but Happy Hour is a steal!", "author": "Yi Z."}

In any case, it's a fantastic option if you have small aka less than 5 party and bar seating is plentiful.  No one really seems to come here for dinner, so it really just seems like a happy hour spot.

Everything was so overpriced for its quality. I felt like  the problems were more because of poor management  and training. Our server made a lot of mistakes but he was trying really hard and he was definitely overwhelmed and in the weeds. He was triple sat three 6+ tables within ten minutes and he was stretched thin. I felt bad, but that's no excuse. The restaurant team should have been helping him more (at least the manager should have jumped in or visited us). One busser was backing him up, even taking our orders. Being short-staffed is not a good enough reason for the storm we experienced. I think the manager partially delivered our food. I specifically told him that I ordered the small salad with NO chicken ($8) and he's like \"this is it.\" Two of our other orders were completely off and had to be re-fired. The server tried really hard, this was definitely a deeper problem of dynamics.\n\nBetween everyone else at our table trying to get the unresponsive/busy staff's attention, I gave up on trying to tell the restaurant that my chicken was raw on the inside, and as a result i was afraid to even eat the romaine around it.

I asked him about the ppx appetizers and he said that they would be right out. We also ordered our guacamole (medium spice) he said he would input the order and proceeded to leave the bar area. Our drinks came out without a problem. Sadly we asked to order a boudin de pollo and asked about our guacamole. Jose checked and let us know that the order was not entered.

Very bright and airy atmosphere.  My favorite feature was the wall long waterfall, gorgeous.  The prices were great, considering the large portions and freshness.  I'm always hesitant to order steak, well done, because often well done at most restaurants means chewy and tuff.  But I figured I would give it a try.  It was perfect, juicy and tender!  Our margarita was quite strong but nothing a little ice couldn't fix.  You get your monies worth.  We also had plantains, Mexican street corn, rice, refried black beans, shrimp and a cheese Enchilada.

The place was crowded, but I guess that's not too much of a surprise when drinks are $6. \n\nThe mango margarita was strong. It didn't taste like mango at all, and upon inspection of the happy hour menu, I realized that it's just tequila, triple sec, and agave. It wasn't a big deal, but if you're looking for something that tastes like mango, don't get this drink. \n\nThe pineapple mojito actually tasted like pineapple. It was tart and sweet and also strong. I'd highly suggest the mojito if you're looking for a sweet cocktail. \n\nWe were planning on meeting with 5 more friends so I asked the front if it was possible to squeeze us in without a reservation. The hostess said that our chances were slim but to put in a name and a number, and they'll try their best. I got a call in 20 minutes for an open table for 7. \n\nThe food is very good, but extremely overpriced. I ordered the Quesadilla de Res from the appetizer menu. It was $11. It was a bit small but the quesadilla was flavorful and delicious. My friends ordered entrees and the portions were quite large, so keep in mind that appetizers are truly appetizer sized here. We also shared 2 orders of the guacamole, which was great with the fresh chips and salsa. They were $14 apiece. \n\nAlthough the service and happy hour drinks were fantastic, I probably wouldn't back to this place for food. You're spending an exorbitant amount of money for food that you can get in the Mission for half the price (with double the portions).

The worst is that the server will ask you if you want guacamole for your chips like it was complimentary dipping sauce for your chips. You get a stone bowl full of guacamole salsa instead.

The server asked if we dined there before and welcomed us back.  Suggested the guacamole to start, the cart was rolled over to the table and a beautiful mocajete was the foundation of our soon to be devoured perfect guacamole.  I was telling the table the queso fundido was to die for, so we ordered that as a second appetizer.  When the cast iron skillet of ooey' gooey melted deliciousness was brought to the table, we served our mom first with one of the perfectly cooked and homemade I might add, corn tortilla.  I mean honestly, if butter was served with them, I would have proposed.  The peppers in the queso fundido add a small amount of heat and the vibrant green cilantro adds a freshness to the melted, salty, creamy cheese we were about to enjoy.

We talked mom (really had to twist her arm) into ordering a Paloma cocktail, this is the cocktail I had, ok fine, a few I had when I was there the first time in my date.  A very mild and smooth tequila with red grapefruit juice, the rim covered in their original concoction of amazing.  A must try!\n\nWe then moved on to entrees, after all the apps I had the chicken tortilla soup which was absolutely delightful.  It is a unique soup here because the broth is more of a sauce (like a red enchilada sauce) with moist and flavorful chicken, plenty of cheese, tortilla strips and fresh cilantro.  Mom had the tinga de res tacos, which were served with a very generous portion of flavorful, juicy and well seasoned meat.  Of course the home made corn tortillas were divine!  The pickled red onions was a great addition of acidity to the tacos!  I love that they serve the tacos on a plate with the cool taco stand so the tacos stay upright, whoever invented this was pure genius.  The others had the Arrachera which was a perfectly cooked medium, with a warm pink center served a top beautifully grilled green and red peppers and onions, oh and I did I forget to mention, more cheese?  It was also served with two other salsas, a green tomatillo salsa, which had a sweet note and a fiery red salsa that had heat.  The entrees were also served with perfectly cooked, fluffy and well seasoned Mexican rice and black beans (retired style).  Both were a great accompaniment to the meal and we were all very impressed with the flavor extracted from the beans and rice.  \n\nLastly our outstanding waiter suggested churros for dessert, he painted a picture I could taste, but unfortunately we were stuffed from the lunch.  We will definitely be back to enjoy the rest of the menu and our new found favorites!  \n\nI hope you give this amazing restaurant a try, it is only two blocks from Embarcadero BART stop and they have a great outdoor eating area and bar area!", "author": "Gregory M."}

The guacamole is made at your table which is a nice touch and you can request your level of spicyness to suite your personal tastes however for what you get the whole menu seems a tad overpriced even for the embarcadero.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-04-28", "description": "Long post - for the short review it is this - The chef has delusions of grandeur, management was rude and overbearing, and service was, in general, deplorable.  \n\nI was in yesterday, for the first time, with two friends who had been there previously.  We were meeting up for happy hour, and the place was definitely busy, but for the location (just off the Embarcadero) this was to be expected.  My friend got there first and got us a table near the back.  It was, also to be expected, quite noisy, but with a little yelling we could hear each other.\n\nSo, our complaints were really all about the service, which was awful.  Simply awful.  My friend arrived promptly at 6:30pm, had her drink order taken fairly quickly, and was just getting her drink when I arrived at 6:50pm.  My drink order gets taken fairly promptly, and I also order the happy hour nacho's.  \n\nBeing a bit of a picky eater I specifically order several of the toppings on the side, and then, to clarify, indicate that I want nothing on my nacho's except beans and cheese.  The waiter takes the order, and the order of my friends, and heads off.  My friend's orders come first, and one is wrong, so we point it out to the waiter.  He takes the wrong dish back to the kitchen and comes back a few moments later with her correct dish, and my nachos.  It has now been about 20-25 minutes since we ordered.  \n\nMy nacho's come with the requested beans and cheese, but also with salsa fresca and cilantro.  I immediately, but very nicely, indicate to the gentleman who brought the dish that my order is wrong, and I didn't want anything except the beans and cheese (ie, no salsa fresca and no cilantro).  He takes the dish back to the kitchen....only to have my waiter immediately bring back the same dish to me indicating that I should eat it because there is \"nothing spicy in it\".  \n\nI need to repeat this - after I sent back my dish, he brought it back to me and tried to convince me to eat it.  \n\nI tried to explain that I wasn't worried about the spice, but that I could not eat onions, which is true (the results are not pretty).  He pretty much talked over me until I repeated myself several times that I was not going to eat it, that he should take it away, and that I wasn't going to pay for it.  My friends and I then had a good laugh at how ridiculous this was.  That the server was arguing with me over my food.\n\nNext someone who appeared to be the manager came out, again, with the same dish!  He indicated that the way I ordered the dish was not actually nacho's.  For those of you who may have never had them:\n\nna\u00b7cho\nn\u00e4CH\u014d/\nnoun\nplural noun: nachos\n\n    a small crisp piece of a tortilla, typically topped with melted cheese and spices.\n\nSure, nacho's can come with all sorts of toppings, but to try to tell me that ordering mine with only beans and cheese didn't make them nachos didn't make any kind of logical sense.  He then explained that they could make them the way I ordered them, but it would take a very, very long time.  Because they were busy.  Soooo, making them with fewer ingredients would take longer.  I again indicated that this did not make sense.  He then offered to bring me chips, a side of melted cheese, and a side of beans, which, he pointed out, was essentially what I ordered.  So, again, using logic, they can bring me all three ingredients separately, but not put them together?  And the chef is the one doing all this incredibly hard work?  Not some line cook?  I, of course, refused and indicated that, at this point things were beyond ridiculous, and that I wouldn't be ordering anything or giving them any more of my money.  I mean, I just wanted some nacho's without any onions on them.  Unless I missed the michelin star on my way in I feel pretty darn comfortable saying that this is not a haute cuisine restaurant.  It's a crappy Mexi-Cali  restaurant with a great location that does booming happy hour business and not a whole lot else.  \n\nThe manager also mentioned that the chef takes pride in his work and presentation, so really what we have is some chef with a seriously over inflated sense of ego for what his job really is offended that I dared to ask (politely, I never raised my voice, I just remained firm) for something in a way that he didn't like.  My order wasn't up to his standards, I guess.\n\nAfter my friends then sent back their food (they certainly weren't going to give them their money either, after that display) the waiter came out and was kinda sorta apologetic, but not really.  No one ever really apologized for not getting my order right and not being willing to fix it.  The waiter let slip that the chef told him he wasn't going to make the order the way I ordered it, but the waiter did not bother coming back to let me know, therefore giving me a choice.  He also told us stories about other times the chef refused to make an order the way a customer requested because he fundamentally disagreed with it.", "author": "Joanna S."}

Wanted to see what the \"hype\" was all about. \n\nI order the enchiladas, which should be a staple of a Mexican restaurant. The sauce was weird, it didn't tasted like your typical, traditional enchilada sauce, so that was puzzling. I couldn't put my finger on the sauce, if it is some new wave enchilada sauce, I ain't buying it. The dish wasn't also very hot when it came out. The only saving grace was the rice and beans that came with it, loved the fact that they had brown rice (healthy!), not that cheesy, salty Mexican rice. The beans were refried black bean, which was also spot on. My friend got the Mexican pie, which he states alright, but definitely nothing to write home about...fyi to all. \n\nWe also ordered the guacamole, which people have been raving about to me. I will say that it was darn good, but the chips that accompanied it could have been better. Seemed closer to store bought, or not that freshly made at the restaurant. They should step that up if I ever want to come back during HH for a hot minute and get that....lol. \n\nI also ordered a margarita. For $12, it was a joke. It was small and didn't taste any better than a $5 margarita in the Mission. Yeah, save your dolla bills and go get one in the Mission. \n\nIn short, I wouldn't go back for a full lunch or dinner, not worth the price. If you want good a Mexican lunch or dinner, definitely save your dollars and feast up in the Mission. But I will end by saying, if I was in the FiDi for a meeting or something, I would definitely do the HH after, which goes until 7pm, and the food and drinks are way cheaper.", "author": "Sonia A."}

We got sat at the bar area and waited about 10 minutes for someone to come over and help us and we ordered margaritas. The margaritas were about the worst I ever had. They did not taste like traditional Mexican margaritas so you might be disappointment if you like margaritas because they were basically awful. I only drank it because I had already paid about 12 dollars for it. And the margaritas came in small glasses like as I I had ordered a drink on the rocks. They should come in margarita glasses. I was hoping to get chips and salsa but never got any, not sure why because the table in front of us had chips and salsa which wasn't listed on the menu. So I was wondering why they had some and not my table. I ordered the beef tinga tacos which had different toppings from other tacos I have had. They had the beef, with cabbage and carrots in vinegar, and a green hot sauce, which I was not asked if I wanted on the side. It was kinda spicy for my taste. I received a side of corn with queso fresco and a chili powder which just overwhelmed the entire dish. Everything was just to spicy altogether to consume. I was exited to order dessert and ordered the churros. What a huge mistake that was. They were Honestly the Worst Churros I have ever had. They were delivered to me burned beyond recognition. I had to crack them open to see if there was any dough inside and there wasn't. I literally had to use my strength to break them, that is how overly fried they were. They were completely horrible. I had to ask the server to take them away. She asked if I wanted to have another order made and I passed on that. I wanted nothing to do with their churros. Worst churros ever.

First, it was 11:45 on a Saturday morning and I was literally the first customer of the day.  I was not given the option of dining room versus lounge.  It had about 30 tables, so I had no idea this was considered the \"lounge\" and different than the dinning room.  \n\nSecond, why have the same menu for the dining room, patio, and lounge when half of the restaurant - unbeknownst to the diners sitting in these sections no less - cannot receive what you go through great lengths to promote?!?

They knew me very well there - the \"MaitreD\" Dexter always greeted me, and would annoyingly try to flirt with me every time... they knew me well. I have  very distinguishable hair.\n\nI went to happy hour with my boss the day before NYE 2014. Mind you, this place is ridiculously dark inside at night. It was dead and we were the only ones at the bar.  I placed my backpack under the bar. Inside the backpack was a MAC laptop, a laptop case containing the laptop, the title to my car, and my birth certificate (DMV errands), and pair of leggings I was gifted.\n\nAfter a few margs we left. Twenty minutes later I realized I left my backpack under the bar seat and called the restaurant to have someone look for it. A bartender put me on hold for a while, and said there was nothing. \nThe second time I called that evening a gal went to look for the item, came back asking \"What are you looking for again?\" and after looking a second time, said \"No we do not have that.\"\n\nA week later Rosa contacted my parent's house in Tennessee saying they found my birth certificate and title to my car but nothing else. Weird because they were inside my laptop case to keep them from bending...\n\nSo... either a thief stole my backpack and kindly came back to the scene of the crime to return part of the contents to a hostess- OR it was a Rosa employee...\n\nWhen I asked to see the videos the manager, Nathan, would not let me.

The deal included a tasting of a margarita, a pitcher of sangria, two entrees, two hot chocolates, as well as a churro. This was a great deal so I knew I had to check it out. Now I have been to this spot a few times for happy hours so I was curious to try their food to see how it was. So I make my way over there on a Saturday. We enter at around noon and it is still pretty empty so we are seated promptly. The servers were very prompt and attentive which I appreciated as I had read many yelp reviews knocking them on this point. \n\nNow I am going to keep this review brief. Overall the food was just okay. Nothing really wowed me which was hugely disappointing. The Guacamole and alcohol was pretty delicious though. Additionally the Churro was oh em gee really good. And I am not a dessert person so trust me when I say a dessert item is solid. It comes out in this bag where they shake it up to make sure the sugar is on the churro. They give you three dipping sauces and the caramel was my favorite by far. My real simple conclusion is that this place is really meant as a happy hour joint. Yes it can be crowded but the guacamole and the drinks were awesome and churros would be a nice ending to a happy hour night. Just wish the food was better but I still walked away that morning with the Churro making me happy although it could have been the adult beverages... shrug", "author": "Dan M."}

Their famous blended pomegranate margarita was tasty.\n\nWe were presented with a fixed menu last night and enjoyed most every dish.  To start, we had their famous guacamole that was prepped right in front of us at the table.  The avocados were fresh and delicious, as well as the only other few ingredients they added to make one of the best guacamole I've had in a while.  It was served with some freshly made tortillas and chips and their two house made salsas.  The Pasilla de Oaxaca salsa was a smoky salsa on crack...I could not stop eating it.\n\nFor starters, we had the ceviche sampler and the duck confit tacos.  I especially enjoyed the duck confit tacos.  The duck was not dry, very moist and the taco was not overdressed.  You could taste each of the ingredients and their freshness.\n\nFor our mains, we each picked a different dish and shared it all so we could taste everything.  We had the Enchiladas Suizas, a Crispy Pork Shank, the Sea Bass and the Beef Short Ribs (not on the fixed menu but they let us order this anyway). I particularly enjoyed the Enchiladas Suiza. I am a suiza fanatic and have eaten many renditions of this in my life but this suiza had a perfect balance and creaminess.  The Crispy Pork Shank was also a winner.  I filled up a couple tortillas with the pork shank, squeezed on some lime and layered in some of the Pasilla de Oaxaca salsa and I was in heaven.  The main portions was enormous and as if I wasn't full already they then brought us out dessert.\n\nFor dessert we had the tres leche cake and the churros. The churros came in a fun little paper bag that they shook up at our table and served hot. They were accompanied three dipping sauces and the chocolate sauce was my favorite.  Tasty, just like a hot chocolate!  They had some issues under cooking our churros but when we let them know, they immediately showed their staff the issue and had a new batch made for us. Even though the churros were slightly undercooked on the interior, the exterior was crispy and perfectly coated with cinnamon and sugar.\n\nOverall a good dining experience even with it being their soft opening. I have no doubt that they will continue to improve. Check it out for yourself and see what you think!", "author": "Susan P."}

One night, I called ahead to make sure that for my (ahem, first and very blind date with a cute guy) reservation, I could be sat in the bar with a great view of the not so big tv to see the 49er game. I got a call back from the host an hour later saying it wasn't possible-- And that someone had been mistaken saying otherwise. I kindly explained my situation (girl to girl, 49er fan to 49er fan, CMON) and she said she would ask the boss before she left on her shift. \n\nWELL. Not knowing what i was in store for, and a little bummed and nervous, I am walking over when I get a text message from the ma\u00eetre d himself. Dexter explained there was a table reserved in the bar and to let someone know when i arrived. \n\nWe had the best seat in the house, a nice appetizer waiting for us when we sat down, and great service the whole night. In fact, whenever I head in now I give him a heads up and he always takes care of us.  \n\nDexter makes this place feel welcoming and on point regardless of how slow the device can be (at times, in the bar or outside, pretty slow-- I usually have to ask for more chips or another rounds during peak hours). He makes sure we know we are appreciated and treats us like top notch guests-- all in all making us want more $12 shots of top shelf tequila, a $24 dollar of heaping freshly made guacamole and 3 more rounds for that matter.

No sir. \n\nAs for the food, here are the highlights:\n- Rolled Crispy Chicken Tacos: Nothing special at all. Does not deserve to be called crispy because it lacks that satisfying crunch.

We ordered a large guacamole and some entrees.\n\n- Large guacamole: $26 for bland guacamole. I'm not being malicious when I say Chipotle guacamole tastes better (I am a big fan of Chipotle's guacamole). But with a double digit price tag, I expect decent guac at least.\n- I ordered the Pollo/Grilled Chicken Breast \"Skillet Style\": I ordered chicken, assuming it was impossible to mess up chicken. I was wrong.The chicken was extremely dry and difficult to eat. While I am relieved I didn't have to eat any more than I did, the entree was exceptionally small for the price point ($16). I usually leave Mexican restaurants stuffed (I don't eat very much either, I'm a small person), but this place left me barely content. \n- My coworker ordered the fish tacos, which they said was good. Another coworker also ordered salad, which she regretted.\n\nWhile the food was not very good, the service was very attentive. I had requested no cheese on my chicken, which the kitchen messed up. I shrugged off the mistake and just picked off the cheese, but my waiter was careful enough (even without my bringing it up, very impressive!) to notice. As a result, he was extremely apologetic and even the manager came over to personally apologize and to offer my meal free of charge.

In a city full of absolutely excellent taquerias, you are doing yourself a disservice by eating at mexican restaurant that charges $18 for an 8oz margarita. Granted, the decor is very nice, and the four sips of margarita weren't terrible, but the ambiance and mediocre drinks are not worth enduring the terrible and terribly overpriced food. \n\nWe started with the guacamole, which was $26 for the table. An unexperienced 18-year-old bus-boy makes it right in front of you, who produces a flavorless, unseasoned, and extremely chunky version of guacamole.\n\nNext, I tried the appetizer mini yellowtail ceviche tacos, which sounded delicious, but were literally served up as 3 bites. Though I would have been thrilled to eat 3 delicious bites, the mini tacos were slathered in some sort of thick mayonnaise-like sauce, and tasted nothing like the greens, fresh yellowtail, or bacon that went into them.\n\nLast, I had the chicken enchiladas, which were recommended by our server, and didn't eat more than a 1/4 of my plate. The enchiladas were stuffed with some very dry and bland slow-roasted chicken, the tortillas were hardly cooked, and there was no cheese visibly present.

I love Mexican food, so I figured we couldn't go wrong here. Man was I wrong. The one way to ruin Mexican food is to charge too much for it. Especially in California, even the dirt cheap Mexican food is delicious, so overcharging for completely mediocre is unacceptable to me. Period.\n\nThe interior and decor was nice enough. Water fixtures on the walls, dim lighting, etc. That was probably the only thing I really enjoyed about my experience here.\n\nI opted for just water, but all of the drinks that everyone ordered were - big surprise here - overpriced. Having my water refilled was a challenge throughout the meal, which is never a good sign. \n\nThe don't start you off with chips and salsa, which I thought was strange because it's a pretty standard, across-the-board complimentary starter at almost all Mexican restaurants. Instead, we ordered the guacamole, which is supposed to be their signature thing. It was made table-side, but the person making it had absolutely no interaction with us whatsoever. My boyfriend didn't even know he was behind him. Prices for the guacamole were absolutely ridiculous - $14 for a small serving (1-2 people) and $26 for a 3-4 people serving. RIDICULOUS. The guacamole was okay, but honestly, the stuff I make at home is better. Nothing can justify that price tag, especially in California where the produce used to make guacamole is plentiful. \n\nThe chicken enchiladas were absolutely nothing special, and incredibly overpriced. \n\nOverall, the thing that bothered me most about this place was the price for the quality and quantity. If you're serving small portions at a high price...it needs to be justified. This was not in any way. That, combined with the poor service is a big miss for me.

The restaurant is close to home for me, a short walk. I had a reservation through OpenTable, and was quickly seated.\n\nI really like the interior of this restaurant. It has a fun color scheme, with lots of eye candy - artistic lighting fixtures, earthy colors, and the divers leaping off the waterfall is certainly creative (see pictures). Music is a mix of modern latin flavor & downtempo, I liked it a lot. Sadly I didn't hear Vamos A La Playa, not even once. (I'm joking.)\n\nOn the Dine About Town menu, they list the table-side guacamole. Unfortunately, you can't get that unless you're a party of two, using your mutual two first course options to get the guacamole. Or, you can pay $7 more to get it as a single eater. It normally costs $14, so I guess I can understand that, considering the whole DAT lunch is $18.95. The way they word this on the menu is not the best, and I can see how it would disappoint some people. Generally when I get guacamole prepared at a table, the waiter brings over avocados, salsa, lime, other fixins & the container to crush everything in in a small hand held tray or basket, makes it, takes the tray or basket & leaves. At Rosa Mexicano, they have a cart they wheel to your table, a little retro, but everything on the cart looks tasty. They prepare your guacamole with some of the biggest avocados I've ever seen (I watched as another table got theirs); I believe Bruce Willis shot down the errant asteroid in Armageddon with one of those. I'm sure it was delicious, I love fresh guac.\n\nThe chips came with two salsas, a red salsa that got a smoky flavor from some of the chiles used, and a green salsa that was milder. That said, have a glass of water or drink ready to go. The sauces are delicious, so you eat a lot of them, but the spicy heat will sneak up on you & all of a sudden you realize you need water.\n\nMy first course was flautas de pollo, which are rolled crispy chicken tacos (think taquitos), covered in red & green salsas, Mexican cheese & sour cream. These were delicious, with so many different flavors, spices, and heat & cooling levels (physical & spice level).\n\nSecond course was enchiladas rancheras, cheese enchiladas in a roasted tomato sauce. From my photo you would not think these were different than what you're used to, but they are. Once again, there are a variety of subtle flavors & spices that hit you. The cheese doesn't entirely melt, and both the cheese & corn tortilla give texture to the dish. This is served with a healthy bowl of refried black beans, which seemed very fresh, unlike some Mexican restaurants where refried beans can taste dried out & generally old. They also include a bowl of brown rice. Now normally, brown rice tastes flavorless & sad, like you're on a diet you hate. This rice was full of flavor, from the cilantro, mint, and chile it was prepared with. Once again, many subtle flavors playing on your palette.\n\nThird course, I got their pastel de queso, a cheesecake. Their cheesecake is light compared to what you're probably used to, and had a razor-thin slice of baked apple which gave a nice flavor. The cheesecake & plate had a drizzle of something that had a flavor & consistency somewhere between applesauce & caramel, hard to describe, but wonderful, and walnuts.\n\nThey're currently running \"The Art of Mexican Mixology,\" a special cocktail menu from Jun 5-30. I believe they do different events like this throughout the year. I tried their tequila sunrise, made with Herradura silver tequila, house-made pomegranate grenadine, and fresh orange juice. Two cherries on top of the glass... The staff assured me they were nothing special, but they tasted infused with an alcohol, or something... Not sure what. EVERYTHING at this restaurant tastes a little different, better than normal. They even had a recipe for it printed on a card attached to the bill, a nice touch.\n\nWaitstaff was attentive & friendly, and either knew the answer to my questions about what chile or spice I was sensing, or was willing to go find out. Water was always topped off; one of the guys was joking with me, that since he started eating there he drinks a lot more water. I believe it!\n\nI love Mexican food, and I really love fancy Mexican food when the chef plays with different chiles that all have different heat levels & spice flavors. This is a fantastic restaurant, and I'm lucky they're close to me. I throughly enjoyed every single thing I ate, and I will be back for more. It was literally difficult to wipe the smile from my face at the end of this feast, I felt so completely sated. Thank you for a wonderful meal.\n\n- Adam", "author": "Adam M."}

The other reviews about Rosa Mexicano were pretty spot on. I would have much rather paid less for the food so going during their happy hour seems like a better deal. We ordered 2 of their table side guacamole which most of us thought was bland with a little spice. I saw they had ceviche and I was pretty excited to try it but when I finally did I was really disappointed. Ceviche is one of my favorite Mexican dishes and they fell short with this dish due once again to the lack of flavor. My table had to pour the green salsa they offer with their chips to even finish it. Not everything was bland. There were dishes we found great like the fondido, so good! Also they make great margaritas, pretty strong. I would come back but it would definitely need to be for their happy hour.", "author": "Angelina R."}

I'm willing however to pay $15 for the best guacamole, and this place doesn't have it. One of the people I was with argued that chipotles guacamole was even better than theirs.. I wouldn't go this far but what I will say is that the guacamole is good, but not special. It's fresh and has good spice, they make it in front of you, it's good. Not great at all.. could use some lime or something special. Also I got tacos, the meat was cooked well but besides that nothing special.

I am curious to know how many tacos you get if you ordered from the regular menu though.\n\nQueso Fundido w/ mushrooms, jalapenos, truffle oil - this is usually one of my faves and I liked it but definitely could have been spicier but if you like mild spice this will be perfect.\n\nLobster ceviche - good amount of lobster but why is this served with saltine crackers? That was a surprise and a serious disappointment. Lobster & saltines should not be served together!\n\nChile rellano w/ vegetables - the mole sauce and vegetables were good.\n\nRed snapper pan seared - didn't try this but was told the fish tasted great\n \nShrimp & scallops over brown rice & pico de gallo - good amount of seafood & the rice tasted great!\n\nDessert:\n\nPumpkin cr\u00e8me brulee - this was fantastic\n\nChurros with three dipping sauces - of the three dipping sauces the chocolate one was the best & the freshly made churros were YUMM!!

Thursday the place was about 3/4 full and Friday it was entirely full so reservations are a good idea.  We had them both times and were seated immediately.  Ambiance is new/trendy and comfortable.  Decent space between tables and the bar area is entirely separate from the dining room so you're not bothered with people standing or walking by your table continuously.\n\nService was good both nights, but I will say the level of knowledge, attentiveness, and enthusiasm between servers seems big.  Our server was great, knew the menu, suggested options (including alcohol pairings), and was totally on it.  I didn't see this mirrored with everyone else though.\n\nFood was good.  Both times we had the guacamole (made at your table) and enjoyed it.  First time I had the chicken enchiladas.  They were OK, but I wouldn't order them again.  Second time around I had the skillet style carne asada which was really good. Finished it off with two flan and one of the cakes for dessert and both were great.\n\nIt's a little on the expensive side for Mexican food even by SF standards.  Patrons were dressed either business casual or looked like they were making a night of it.  No hoodies or overly casual crap like that.  A number of folks gave some pretty bad reviews, but look at what they complained about and give it a shot.  I hope the places growing pains all work out.", "author": "Jeff M."}

I count it as one of the most memorable dining experiences.  After so many years, I still have not forgotten the meal.  It was epic.\n\nMove forward to 2012, Rosa Mexicano is a different restaurant.  The table-side preparation of guacamole is not anything new, but it certainly is nice to have it prepared fresh and it is delicious.  This is one of the few holderovers I recognize on the menu from Josefina Howard's days.  That and the pomegranate margaritas, also not new but still delicious.\n\nThe seasonal salsa was delicious.  They need to bring larger serving of it, the little soup spoon of it is a taste and not enough for a party of three or more.  They will bring more on request and the habanaro was really good, if a tad on the sweet side.  \n\nI indulged in the lunch special and was not disapointed.  The fish taco was top notch, the soup was delicious and the desert of flan on top of a brownie was surely not strict cuisine of Mexico if you are talking street food.  It is more the modern Mexican cuisine and I liked it very much.  People make complain about authenticity, but chances are if you order food at a resto in the D.F. it's going to be more like this than 20th and Mission, S.F.  Many of the items on the menu look delicious and I am looking forward to a return visit.  The seasonal options look intriguing and I will bet by summer, the color and palates will be popping from the fresh flavor.\n\nLike so many new dining spots, the lack of carpeting makes for a noisier experience (Slanted Door) as the dining room fills up.  Intimate this won't be.  Plenty of room between tables and the decor was nice and sleek.\n\nThe service was attentive and not bothersome.", "author": "Donna H."}

Based on how bad things went, I wouldn't go back on a slow day either.\n\n$50 pitchers of margaritas that you had to fight your server/wait in line for, mostly ice, and at some point they stopped even trying to pull the off-brand labels off the sour mix.  Ended up tasting like watery lemon-lime kool aid with a splash of well tequila.\n\nThe guac was made from fresh ingredients, which was nice, but because of the rush they barely mashed it at all.  Came out more like an avocado salad.  Salsas are nice and spicy, and the one thing they were actually nailing was steady chip production.  We envisioned a black belt Chip Master in the back that decided to put the whole team on his back and make it happen for the pride of chip makers everywhere.\n\nOn Cinco de Mayo, they went with a $35 fixed menu.  Can't blame them in hindsight given all the confusion, but I think they might have been better off just closing the kitchen down to only appetizers or tacos.  We literally could not order a quesadilla, they simply wouldn't let us.\n\nTo add insult to injury, at one point the manager came out and started grilling us on whether we were going to the bar to buy drinks or if we were ordering everything through our waiter, because \"he wanted to make sure his waiters were taken care of.\"  The irony of course is that nobody seemed to want to make sure *we* were taken care of.  \n\nLong story short, this place might make decent food on a slow night, but if you want to come here on Cinco de Mayo, I would recommend the Chipotle down the street.

I just spent 30 minutes sitting in the restaurant after my meal, while management tried to figure out how to accept this gift check.  It should be noted that printed on the front of the gift check it says \" dear open table restaurant  please process as a travelers check.\"   After 30 minutes, and management not being able to figure it out, I ended up paying for my meal with my American Express card, and leaving truly disgusted with the ignorance level.  What would the manager have done if someone handed them an American Express travelers check? This is a very common thing, and travelers checks are treated just like cash.

Not bad, but nothing memorable.  They need to add something..not sure what, but they can definitely improve.\n\nPomegranate Margarita - DELICIOUS!  Order it!  Also they have a heavy pour with that thing so be careful because it is so delicious.\n\nI order the Camarones Veracruzana/Shrimp Brochette Shrimp dish and WOW.  I am REALLY picky about my shrimp and I am often disappointed at restaurants with their shrimp dishes, but this was delicious.  Great flavor and a generous portion.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Enchiladas.  I am not sure which Enchiladas he ordered, but it was delicious.  I am not a fan of enchiladas (I know what you are thinking - what kind of Mexican am I), but I just don't, but these enchiladas were great.\n\nIt is great for small groups and large groups.  They have a great outdoor patio area that is great for after work drinks or brunch.  Although if you are looking to be in the sun (which I LOVE to be in the sun), make sure you got before 12pm because then the building block the sunlight. \n\nI think the prices are a little bit pricey for what the dishes are, but it is not unreasonable.  \n\nAmbiance is great.

The four star experience starts with the hand made at your table Guacamole - this is worth showing up for - just to eat this - and I was with a group event, so I didn't see the prices of this stuff, but I gotta think it don't come easy with that type of hand crafted experience.  I could have eaten that entire bowl myself.\nAppetizers - we had Ceviche de Camarones (That be Shrimp for those looking for the Wiki translation) - These were really good - marinated in a light citrus/avocado blend and the Queso Fundido - Fundido indeed - grab a couple of freshly made tortillas and slop some of this on and you're good to go.\nMain course - we had one of everything I think - Carnitas Tacos - pork and potatoes - reminded me a little bit of pork skins - but it was just the way the meat was fried, made good mini tacos - Their salsa is HOT - so a little goes a long ways with that stuff.  We also had the Pollo/Grilled Chicken Skillet Style - sweetly marinated chicken great - also great for a mini taco - hot out of the skillet.  Salmon Poblano - my least favorite - seemed a little undercooked for my taste and I'm not a fan of Kale, but if you are - it was the Tuscan Variety, which to me always screams Mexican prepared - last but not least, was my personal favorite of the entrees,  the Tablones - braised beef short ribs marinated in guajillo and pasilla chile with smokey mestiza sauce and rajas - That would be my order next time - gigantic pieces of beef and loved loved loved that sauce - I didn't even have to write down the rest of what was in it, as for our group, they did a hand made menu for us letting us know all the great things we were eating.  I saw someone whining on her about not having pitchers of margaritas - that is all we had all night - two versions - one standard and one spicy.  They looked like they kept a big urn of both of these to draw from all night in the middle of the restaurant, so maybe the other person just missed that part.\nDessert - Tres Leches de Zarzamora, Churrs en una Bolsa & Flan - all were terrific, but order the Churros and they come with a variety of dipping sauces, that was the best part of those - the sauces were delicious.

You see, being Mexican myself, I expect to be astounded by the flavors, and concoctions restaurants try to create and pass it off as Mexican.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the decoration is refined, and not full of tchotchkes like Chevy's, but with a beautiful wall full of \"clavadistas\" that I am sure was inspired by La Quebrada in Acapulco. BUT unlike Chevy's the guac at RM did not have queso fresco sprinkled on top. Unlike Chevy's, the chips at RM were not warm and toasty. \n\nThe Food was forgettable. \nMy better half and I had the following:\n\nApps:\ntwo layered corn tortillas, in the center was some shreds of duck, inundated with some creamy chipotle/habanero sauce. I think they called it Zarape de Pato. BTW the server raved about it and it was nothing to rave about, to add insult, it arrived at room temperature, not hot, and far from warm. Because the other half likes to stay under the radar, I was instructed to not behave like Mariah Carey, I obliged. \n\nIn addition, we had the Ceviche sampler... or shall is say, 3 bite-size (LITERALLY!!) portions of ceviches. One which was over watermelon, YUCK. The other two were pretty tasty, too bad one was a one inch taco filled with ceviche, YES, one inch. Call me a size queen if you must, but I wanted more than one inch ceviche taco!!! \n\n...and of course the \"table side guacamole\" needing some salt, and some lime, and like previously mentioned, some queso fresco to fisnish it off. \n\nEntrees:\nAlhambres Mexicanos: Steak and Chorizo over rice, and two salsas directly poured on the sides of the rice. Now, why would they pour generous amounts of salsa directly on the plate? What if the salsas were too spicy, or nasty!? Overall, it was OK. But I did not appreciate the overzealous salsas drowning my rice. \n\nSlow Braised Short Ribs: Very fatty.... bland tasting. Overall not okay. Could have done better with the \"Tequila/Beer\" marinade. As in, actually marinate it next time!There was actually no flavor whatsoever on the frickin fatty meat.

This place is awful.\n\nThe main terrible thing is the prices.  On their lunch menu it's $14 for a quesadilla with chicken.  In San Francisco?  Are you kidding me.  No, they are not kidding.  $12 for a margarita that tastes like it comes from a bottle (because it did, as you'll find out in a moment).   Maybe it's a $5 margarita, if you aren't too picky.  Everything on their menu is priced like that, about twice as expensive as it should be.\n\nThe other thing about this place is that the waiter I had was pretty pushy, trying to get me to buy more stuff.  For example, the $12 margarita (which says it has fresh lime juice in it):  after I order he says, oh you should get one of the more expensive ones because the one I ordered doesn't have fresh lime juice.  It's from a bottle.  I say, \"but it says fresh lime juice right here\" and he says, \"yes, fresh from the bottle.\"  So it felt like the menu was lying and the server was up-selling.  He didn't take no for an answer and asked again.  Then he comes back and asks if I want table-side guacamole service.  Which is pretty hilarious, since it costs another $14.  \n\nThe only plus was that the quesadilla was tasty.   The tortilla was crispy and the cheese was melted pretty well.

We noticed that this restaurant had a lot of mixed reviews on Yelp, but we were craving Mexican and this was one of the few places listed. \n\nThe service at Rosa Mexicano is great - from the hosts to the bussers to the servers. Decor here is also great - I really enjoyed physically being in the restaurant for my dinner. However, I am giving 2 stars because the food, along with the price, is just so not worth it.\n\nWe ended up ordering a la carte (vs. the Dine About Town prix fixe menue) since my bf didn't really like the entree options on the special menu. We ordered the following: Guacamole, Pork Belly and Scallops tacos, Chicken Enchiladas, and Sangria. The Guacamole was pretty good and very fresh - they do make it at your table and you can adjust the taste on the spot if you like. My biggest gripe about this place is that the entrees are priced between $18-$30. I don't mind high prices, but for those prices, the food better be good. The dishes here look pretty but taste like nothing. My Pork Belly and Scallops tacos were dry, boring, and very bland. The sound of \"Pork Belly and Scallops\" screams tasty and delicious to me, but the dish was the complete opposite. My boyfriend had the Chicken Enchiladas and after one enchilada, he was done with it and did not enjoy it at all. The Sangria here is just okay - tastes better when I toss ingredients together at home and make it in a few minutes.\n\nBasically we paid for bland, tasteless dishes at $18 - that's a big no no. Along with that, Mexican food is supposed to be tasty, delicious, and very hearty - the dishes here were light and bland. \n\nI definitely won't be returning - hopefully they change things up - not sure how long this place can last. If you want Mexican food with a nice setting, make a visit to Tropisueno - they do it just right - hearty, delicious Mexican cuisine in a nice setting at a very reasonable price.\n\n$85 down the drain... should have went to a Taqueria!", "author": "Tiffany K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-08", "description": "My friends and I were stoked when this spot opened.  We live a few blocks away and were getting tired of hitting up Palominos.  So we went on a Monday night. The d\u00e9cor was very nice, the space was large, ample outdoor and indoor seating, TV's in the bar area. So far so good.  The happy hour menu also looked promising, with its selection of cheap bites and drinks. Again, so far so good.  We ordered a few food items and drinks.  Then the food came out, and this is when things got a little weird.   The Hamachi tacos were tiny. I mean \"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\" tiny.  They were more fit to be fed to a gnome than a human.  Although, it was pretty tasty and the truffle oil complimented the Hamachi very well.  I just could have used about 30 of these gnome tacos.  We also ordered the happy hour tacos, or should I say taco, because just one came out when I swore our waitress told us they came in orders of three.  Anyway, the menu said it was a lamb taco, but it definitely was pork.  The pork tasted fine, except it came on some sort of buckwheat pita. A simple corn or flour tortilla would have been cool. We also ordered the chicken flautas, which was probably the best item since it was human size and it came in an order of three.  Not feeling satisfied, we then ordered the ceviche, or at least we thought it was ceviche.  It came as a trio sampler.  One was extremely salty, the other consisted of raw oyster soaked in hot sauce and not sure what the third one was.  And they served it with saltine crackers. Not sure salty crackers are the best item to serve with already salty ceviche.  I'm pretty sure I exceeded my salt intake for the day with those few bites.   At this point I was ready to give  Rosa two stars.  But then the waitress asked us how our meal was and we gave our honest feedback.  A minute later a mysterious man in a suit appears and apologizes and even offered to take the ceviche off our bill. Unfortunately we already paid.  He was really cool and explained that they are new and still experimenting with their menu. Totally understandable.  He even offered to bring us a desert on the casa.  I asked for flan and he said they made an excellent flan and that he would bring it out.  At this point I was ready to bump them to three stars because the mystery man was really cool about it. But then the flan came out.  Flan is one of my favorite deserts and I consider myself somewhat of a flan connoisseur, and what came out definitely was not flan.  It was a chocolate mousse/ mud pie thing.  It tasted decent, but it just wasn't flan.  So I ordered another beer to drink away my disappointment, but it took over 10 minutes to come. So I had to bump them back down to two stars.  \n\nOverall, this place is like an overpriced Chevy's.  We didn't try the other entr\u00e9e items, but most were in the $20 to $30 range.  I really hope they can fix the menu because this spot definitely has potential.  In the meantime, we'll be back at Palominos. FML.", "author": "Grant L."}

It's good.  I'm a pretty big fan of the margaritas.  They also have a nice selection of happy hour bites.  The downside is tables at the bar fill up super fast (especially on Fridays) and it gets quite noisy.  \n\nDinner -   Dinner was a 2 star experience.  Food isn't great and definitely overpriced.  My boyfriend's beef enchiladas were good, but I was bored of my cheese enchiladas after two bites.  My friend couldn't finish her chicken ones.  We ordered the guacamole \"spicy\" but there was no spice to be found.  The wait staff was decent but the host was rude.  Also, the restaurant does not let you order drinks from the happy hour menu if you are sitting in the restaurant section, which I find annoying.  \n\nBottom line - I'll probably come back for happy hour.

I went there yesterday (Monday Nov 5) with clients at noon after a meeting. There were 6 of us and I hadn't made reservations so we ended up sitting at a bar table. That was absolutely fine - made a business lunch a little lighter and more fun! But...10 minutes of us just hanging out and talking, noone had come by to take our drink/appetizer order. I finally got up and went to the bar to ask if someone will be servicing our table. About 5 mins later a waiter comes up to ask for drinks and we tell him we're also going to order to save time. The menu has a \"Time Crunch\" option for lunch. Since we'd already burned 15 minutes and everyone had to be back in the office no later than 1, we assumed this would be a good dining option. My dad told me never to assume....\n\nFlash forward 20 minutes and we haven't received anything that was ordered. We didn't even get a complementary bowl of chips that seemed to go on everyone's table as soon as they sat down. I asked our waiter to check on the status of our meal. He came back saying it would be done soon. 10 minutes later one of my guests asked and the waiter said it would be ready soon. Now it's almost 1 and we all have to run. I asked for the meals to be boxed up and a few of the gang decided they'd stay to get their food. The boxes didn't come until about 1:05 and I was told that the rest of the food didn't come until almost 1:30! I don't even know fine dining restaurants with this horrible of service.

It was nice and cool inside, it wasn't very crowded so we got a table immediately and they had a big menu of margaritas, what's not to love? The restaurant is absolutely gorgeous inside. There is a huge wall of cascading water with diver figures descending with the water behind them. The walls are vibrant colors in orange, pink, and purple. It was really pretty. \n\nUnfortunately the service wasn't quite as good as the venue and the prices were a little inflated. Our server inquired if we were \"just there for water\" while we were looking at the menu which felt rude, but she got better as she realized that we were actually ordering. She also was very concerned about my request for a mojito made with rum instead of tequila (as they are normally made), but she managed to agree to it and it was delicious. Drinks took 15 minutes before any of the bartenders even started making them. I'm not sure where they were because no one was behind the bar. It was not overly busy, but there were at leave 30-40 people in the restaurant...it felt like a bar with that many people there should have some bartenders.

The composition of the sauces and variety of exciting dishes served, along with the use of organic ingredients, puts this restaurant at the top in my view.  Add to that a beautiful decor. The high ceilings allow for good acoustics so you can carry on a good business conversation.  Yes, the guacamole prep at the table side is a great start, but the enchiladas are to die for.  All of the food is pure Mexican heaven and every time I have attended, the service has been excellent. The prices are high compared to the Tex-Mex slop houses that some of the YELP critiques like, but this is no slop house. It is a first class restaurant for those who have a discerning taste for good food, and not the faire served about a mile down the road at the sadly normal Tex-Mex joints that proliferate in the City providing mostly low quality so-called food at rock bottom prices. \nPlease try this fine Mexican restaurant and enjoy.", "author": "Bill L."}

While the atmosphere at the SF location is more relaxed many of the attributes were the same. We expected terrific food and beverage and got it with the La Cl\u00e1sica margarita (best mag we've ever had), Pescado Pibil grilled white fish and Chamorro crispy pork shank as entrees, and the Tres Leches de Zarzamoras dessert.\nBut the signature Guacamole en Molcajete as an appetizer was a real disappointment. We asked for medium spicy but our guacamole came very bland, like it needed more salt and lime as well as jalape\u00f1o. We resorted to adding the side dish of green salsa verde into the bowl to help the flavor. Likely the waitress didn't really have experience making this dish. In NYC Rosa uses specialists to prepare the guacamole at table side, whereas here in SF it appeared that every waiter and even the restaurant host were making the dish. Better to stick to specialists I think.\nService could also use some improvement. Our waitress was perhaps new to the trade and always seemed off on timing and not meeting our needs. Thirty seconds after plopping down the large drink menu and dinner menu she asked if we wanted a drink and we said \"just a moment\". We picked our drinks within 5 min and entrees within 10 min but she never came back to take the order other than to quickly set the guacamole on the table and leave. We ate some chips but then sat with arms crossed for a while, absent drinks, before she finally asked if everything was OK. So after 25 min at the table and the appetizer half gone we finally got our drinks! Then she waited more time before taking our food order. The bottom line is that the twosome at the table next to us were seated after us and almost finished their meal before we got our entrees. Additionally, she wanted to clear away my margarita when it was still partially full, and bring me a second one. Finally, the cappuccino we ordered was only  lukewarm and had to be replaced. Through all of this the waitress exhibited a somewhat forced pleasantness but haughtiness as if we were the problem, not her service.\nSo there it is - we'd give the restaurant 4/5 stars and will come back but hope the waiter staff is better trained and more professional the next time.", "author": "Michael B."}

I would much rather save my energy and just never go back. But this time, I could not let it slide. I had to let the rest of the Yelp world know what a waste of time this place is. \n\nDesperate to find a happy hour on a late Saturday afternoon, and with no other place having one, my family and I take a chance on Rosa. As soon as we walked in, we could tell they were prepping for the anticipated cinco de mayo crowd. And as such, the reggaton mash up was blaring, and made it a little difficult to speak. Thankfully my sister-in-law asked for them to turn down the music, and the d.j. gracefully complied. \n\nOk, so we sit down, decide to order a few margaritas, and few nibbles to accompany the libations. Since there were 7 of us, the server suggests we order a guacamole for 6 to accompany our fundido order. Sure, a guacamole for six...that sounds reasonable. Eh, wrong! It wasnt until we receive the bill that we are alerted to the fact that a guacamole, which was bland and lacking flavor, was $26.00!!! Thats right, folks! $26 dollars for a bland, but FRESH, guacamole. Seriously??!! You can get avocados from the farmers market for $1.00 each right now. You only put 2 to 3 whole avocados in there. Are you seriously about to charge me $26.00 for guacamole that was sub par?! And our poor mother paid the bill!!! UGH. \n\nAfter being blindsided by the bill, any positive experience, interaction, etc... was forgotten. It was shady that the server suggested a menu item (we were never provided menus either. Just the happy hour menu that was on the table) that was $26.00 and didnt tell us ahead of time. I use to serve, and I would have never thought of doing something so underhanded. \n\nThats just one of many things that happened during our brief dining time at Rosa Mexicano. I could go on about the wrong drink orders and such, but im exhausted just thinking about this abominable place\n\nNeedless to say, you couldnt pay me to dine there!

Portions were small, but the feedback was the food was \"okay\".\n\nBottom line - if you don't mind paying extra for things like ambiance and service, give it a try, but if you think you're going to get some great Mexican food for these prices, I'd go elsewhere.\n\nI enjoy good value when I go to restaurants where I feel like I get what I pay for and this is not one of those establishments.

But not chile verde, it was something else.  It just looked like it didn't go together and they just threw it together on the plate.

Unfortunately I didn't get to try a drink here but the decor is pretty similar to NYC. It's hard to pay upscale for Mexican when the Mission is right around the corner. Probably a good place to take clients as it is more on the pricier end.", "author": "Jeanne C."}

I ordered the \"caesar salad\" which was 7 stalks of romaine basically drizzled in mayo and nothing else.  The \"huge bowl\" of guacamole barely gave each person in our party of 3 a dollop and we all looked at each other saying \"was that really a true serving each?\".  The ceviche sampler  as my entree was approximately 2 tablespoons of ceviche served on a piece of watermelon and a taco shell the size of my thumb for $17.  Don't waste your money; hit your local taco joint or better yet, go to Taco Bell.  What a rip off and can you tell I'm pissed that I came home hungry after a $200 bill??", "author": "Bev T."}

I am crazy about the Rosa Mexicanos in New York City and Washington, DC, but the LA and San Francisco restaurants have truly let me down.  I don't know what it is, but so much of the magic of the place has been lost on the west coast.  The vibe is very different and the decor is too dark inside as well, which made it feel sleepy.  There were very few people there on a Saturday night which is never a good sign and the guacamole for four cost $26.  I have never seen or heard of guacamole that expensive.  The materials cost cannot be more than a couple of dollars, so it is outrageous and truly detracts from the experience, sadly.  I am not a vegetarian, but there was only one vegetarian option on the menu (cheese enchiladas) so the menu seemed to lack some creativity in my opinion.  There were no salads and nothing that felt bright or fresh on the menu.  I wouldn't go back and am very disappointed.", "author": "Alison S."}

Restaurant was nicely decorated, trendy with a flair or Mexico (but just a flair!  Husband wanted to try their aguas frescas (strawberry drink) and was looking forward to this refreshing treat!  It came in its own cute little pitcher but there was truly nothing special about it.  Hit up a local Mexican restaurant and you'll know what I'm talking about!  We HAD to order the tableside guacamole just because.  I'm not super big on guac but I have to admit, this was delish!  We asked for spicy and that we got and we were not disappointed.  The flavors were nicely balanced and even though its quite pricey (Single serves 2/3 for $14), we both agreed that it was worth the munch! Next on the order was the Nachos de Panza/Pork Belly Nachos. This was nice and actually had a kalua pig flavor and we were pleasantly surprised by this dish.  We also ordered the Ceviche Sampler (ceviche is marinated raw seafood).  Our sampler came with the Ahi Tuna:Chile de \u00e1rbol, orange supremes and watermelon; Hamachi/Mini Hard Shell Hamachi Tacos:Diced yellowtail, serrano chile, bacon, arugula and truffle oil and Pescado/Local White Fish: Scallop emulsion, creamy avocado, crispy serrano ham and yucca frita. We are a raw fish family and we always love ourselves some rawness...but this dish was okay.  Disappointed and common and just not what you would hope for when you are paying close to $20 for bite sized morsels.  Last on the list was the Panza con Callos de Hacha/Pork Belly and Scallops: Diver scallops, pork belly, spicy orange-habanero salsa. Although the presentation was nice, it stopped there.  They had a generous slab of pork belly which we felt should have been chopped into pieces to allow our corn tortilla to roll around it but the flavor was lacking. It came with three different type of accompaniments (roasted corn in a creamy sauce, escabeche (marinated cauliflowers, carrots, onions and beans), and a chipotle kidney bean salsa), none of which really did much to the flavor.  Lunch was fine...highlight was a lunch date with my husband which is rare but we both decided that if we should ever come back, its for the guac and pork belly nachos. Those two alone would do a belly good.", "author": "T C."}

We go up and he doesn't even look at us.. instead.. he says.. do you have a reservation... Hmmm. No we don't.. but thanks for asking..  Anyways.. your place is not that busy.. why have a reservation? Moving on... well if it's too busy here.. we can walk over to Perry's which I would have enjoyed WAYYYYY better.  Ok.. thank you host.. with the stank face.. we will try you next time... WAIT!  he looks at us finally.. and says he has something.. still attitudy!  He sits us at a table in the middle of the room. The waiter was nice and friendly enough but the host really bugged me.. we ordered the nachos, enchiladas, and something else that I forget.... the food was not the greatest mexican either.. The place was super expensive.  Also.. if your going to make something spicy.. note that its spicy.. the nachos we unedible. It was all kinda BLAH! Don't waste your time or money on this place.

Only until I asked did it arrive. \nI aksed our server what entree she would recommend/likes best and she said she hadn't tried any but that a couple of the dishses are quite popular. Ok...server, you need to have tried the food!\nWe ordered the breakfast tamale and the carnitas hash. The hash was extremely greasy and flavorless and the presentation of the tamale was horrible (it looked like someone had vomited into the skillet). \nWe also ordered a pitcher of white sangria which was very weak and ok at best.\nAdmittingly the best part of the meal was the churros and the mexican hot chocolate, however, I had already checked out based on the rest of the meal and the poor service.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

The Tres Leche cake topped with meringue graced with assorted fresh berries were delicious. It's one of the best Mexican Restaurants I have ever eaten in the US and worth the extra tab.

First, for how expensive this place is they give you laminated menus and the check is just a recipe that's thrown on your place. There's no grace or elegance about the process.  Besides that the food isn't that great and very expensive for how much it costs.  We got guacamole and chips for $14 and it was disgusting. No flavor, no spice. It just looks really cool when they bring out a whole cart and prepare the dish in front of you.  Not to mention, the waiter we had gave us judgmental looks when we first didn't want to order alcoholic drinks or appetizers.  The food was alright but now amazing, I've had much better food.  Finally, because our waiter was a douche the whole night we only tipped him 7 dollars and he shook his head when he saw that.  I felt that 7$ for awful service was good and it was better than no tip.  I will never be going back here if I am in SF again and hopefully no one has such a bad experience!", "author": "Neha K."}

Table-side guacamole is fine, not great, but perfectly fine, margaritas were ok, although everything is overpriced.  Empanada's ok, but the ceviche sampler (none real standouts) was served--I kid you not--with a plate on which sat a little glass bowl with 5 saltine crackers!  (There were 4 of us.)  We asked for more crackers; none came.  The entrees showed up at different times (all took a long time); the carne asada meat was cooked nicely, but the sides, including the refried beans, were cold (the waiter replaced them after we asked).  The fresh tortillas were good, as was the smoky salsa, but the chicken tortilla pie was bland.  We ordered dessert, along with coffee and hot chocolate.  2 of the desserts showed up.  No coffee.  No other desserts.   Unfortunately, it's the sort of restaurant where the waiter is all over you at the beginning of the meal, speaking in grandiose terms about the contents of the salsas, or the amazing tequila collection, etc., then disappears.  I eventually had to get up twice to find a waiter to find our waiter.  Later another one of the desserts showed up without much of an apology or excuse.  Then the coffees showed up.  And finally, after I stopped another waiter, we got the hot chocolate (served without the topping promised in the menu).   You'd think after such terrible service, someone would have apologized, maybe even comped a dessert.  No.  No one seemed to care.  There seem to be a lot of employees...I just don't know what they're doing.", "author": "Keith J."}
