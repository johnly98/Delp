Very attentive and warm service. A romantic ambience to enjoy dinner in a quiet and intimate setting.  The menu prices are also quite reasonable for the high quality of the food and level of service.\n\nI generally avoid North Beach when dining out, though it has a handful of good restaurants, there are far too many mediocre tourist-traps and the nighttime scene is crowded and touristy. Da Flora is definitely a compelling reason to go to North Beach. The small restaurant sits at Filbert and Columbus on the edge of the North Beach commercial district, so while it is in a very picturesque part of the neighborhood, it is somewhat off-the-beaten path of the main \"restaurant scene,\" making it relatively easy to get a table and avoid the annoying crowds.  \n\nThe menu changes regularly and focuses on fresh, farm-to-table contemporary Italian cuisine.  So, you will find unique new entrees as well as new variations of classic dishes.  Truly, everything from the appetizers to the desserts were flavorful, excellently prepared, beautifully presented, and delicious.  We were warmly greeted and seated promptly, we received excellent service throughout the meal, we actually got a large table for two with plenty of space around it, and we could hear each other talk!  After so many dinners shouting at each other over the noise one typically experiences in SF restaurants, it was terrific to be able to have a pleasant conversation. The whole dining experience was wonderful, and we look forward to going back.\n\nI highly recommend Da Flora for delicious, lovingly prepared and beautifully presented food served in a romantic and intimate setting with excellent service.", "author": "Christopher B."}

Walked in without a res & were seated instantly around 7:30 \n\nOur server was very attentive and made excellent wine recommendations, he was great! \n\nAfter checking yelp for recommendations we started with the sweet potato gnocchi. They were soft little puffs of heaven in a creamy sauce with baconnnnn . We used the bread to dip in the sauce because it was soooo delicious, give me more! It's not a huge portion, but a nice way to start the meal. We also shared the Caesar salad and sole dish. I'm not the biggest fan of Caesar salads but the server convinced me it was mild. It's a lighter dressing and fresh salad, but a little too anchovy-y for me.. the bf loved it though ! The sole is a very small portion, but cooked well.. the Meyer lemon sauce it comes in is wonderful , make sure to drizzle it on top of everything. Has a side of greens and crispy potatoes. \n\nThe menu is handwritten and kind of hard to read, it took a while to figure it out. \n\nWe would definitely go back & we're happy we found this little gem.", "author": "danielle a."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-29", "description": "My husband and I wanted to eat out somewhere in the neighborhood on Friday night and after throwing a few ideas around, Da Flora popped into my head. Even though it's an incredible restaurant, it can be easy to overlook it because it's located at the very end of the \"Italian restaurant\" section of Columbus. Right off the park, it's an adorable spot on the corner that almost looks like an old antiques store from the outside. We've eaten at Da Flora once before after a recommendation from my father, and had a wonderful experience. I can't recall everything we ordered, but I do remember telling the server that my mushroom risotto was the most authentic risotto I'd ever had outside of Italy. \n\nWe walked in around 7pm without a reservation and were immediately sat at table by the door. The decor/vibe of the restaurant is so warm and welcoming. I love all of the random art and antiques around the restaurant; it feels like my crazy Italian aunt's dining room in southern Italy. The server, who is married to the chef (and is also the co-owner of the restaurant), is incredibly friendly and attentive. Their menus are handwritten, as its constantly changing, and served in these adorable Venetian menu books. They also have a very reasonable and  interesting wine list; both times we tried a wine that we were unfamiliar with and were pleasantly surprised. This time, we tried a Schaiva, which is a light-bodied red wine that tastes like Pinot Noir. It was delicate and light in color, and I will definitely start looking out for this wine. We had a difficult time deciding on two starters/appetizers since they all sounded delicious, but we ended up picking the smoke prosciutto and melon dish (bursting with flavor), and the sweet potato gnocchi, which is an absolute must; they were the lightest and fluffiest gnocchi I've ever tasted. They also brought deliciously oily focaccia to our table (and we definitely asked for seconds). For our entrees, I ordered the braised chicken thighs with summer squash and crisped polenta. My husband ordered the orecchiette with roast eggplant, Calabrese sausage, and toasted bread crumbs. Both dishes were exceptional. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the different textures of the squash and polenta really completed the dish. \n\nBy the time we finished our entrees, we were totally happy and stuffed. The entire dining experience was intimate and relaxing, and the final bill was very reasonable given the quality of the food. We will absolutely be eating at Da Flora more often!", "author": "Regina L."}

The experience was so memorable, we decided to head there rather than checking out a new place (I know, this is not standard behavior while traveling). \n\nWhile our memory of Da Flora was epic and I would have sung it's praises until the Venetian cows came home, this time fell just a bit flatter than we expected. \n\nI had the mushroom manicotti, which was actually more of a crepe than ravioli. It wasn't bad, just a completely different texture than I was expecting. However, really amazing mushroom flavor and the cheese was creamy and delicious. While the flavor was good, the portion was tiny. The carpaccio and the caesar we ordered were super tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary for a high-class Italian restaurant. \n\nOne thing we noticed was that there weren't very many meat options on the menu at this time. I understand that this happens when a restaurant changes around their menu regularly, but I felt the balance was a bit off in this experience. Everyone raves about the gnocchi (what my husband had last time), but it wasn't on the menu this time and he was a bit disappointed. \n\nFinally, because it was late August and the restaurant doesn't have air conditioning, the wine was a bit warm. It's stored in the restaurant, not in a fridge, so it was definitely a reflection of the temperature in the room. For the price of the food and drink, a wine fridge is definitely something they might want to invest in. \n\nI'm not sure I'd be in such a hurry to come back after this experience, but it'll definitely still be on my radar if I'm in the area.", "author": "Kristy C."}

Hubby and I came here for date night, we asked for water, water didn't come. 2/3 way through the dinner, we were able to make eye contact with a waiter and got our water. And our water was not refilled. It just sat there empty and sad. The place was around half empty so there's no excuse for that. Also, we still had 1/3 bottle of wine left when the bill came and the waiter told us to \"take our time\". In around a minute, another waiter came and took our bill away to the register when we didn't even have the chance to put our card in. From what I read in other reviews, that's around what I expect from the service.\n\nNow onto the good part, the food. We shared the sweet potato gnocchis with bacon, the squid ink pasta with baby squid and the pork chops. The gnocchis were lovely, the cream sauce was divine and I wish I could lick the plate. The weird thing about the dumplings is that some were a lot lighter than others, maybe they were from different batches. Regardless, with the sauce, I could dip cotton balls in there and it would still be fabulous.\n\nThe pasta dish is probably one of the top three pasta dishes that I've ever had. It's so simple, with freshly made squid ink pasta, impossibly tender baby squid and a simple tomato sauce. All the flavors just pop and the texture of the fresh pasta (perfectly el dente) and the squid, wow, just wow.\n\nThe pork was very tender and juicy, surprisingly so, in fact, because just looking at the coloring of the meat, I thought it might be slightly overcooked, but it was oozing with juice and flavor. The meat was perfectly caramelized and just so good. The celery cake tasted a bit funny. It was slightly gummy. I couldn't decide if I liked it or not because I love celery root but the texture of the other starches in the cake made it unpleasant. \n\nI'm always a food over service kind of person. Considering the prices here, with around $15 apps and $22 pastas and $26 secondi dishes, I would think the service should be better, but the food overcomes the shortcomings. The atmosphere in the restaurant is what I saw in mom-pop places in Italy, very homey and it was actually pretty quite. I think it's a great date spot because the lighting is good and the bottles of wine are fairly priced, too (average around $50 a bottle). Overall, I enjoyed my experience and would come back, however, if you value server as the most important factor in your dining experience, I would avoid this place at all cost.", "author": "Alice W."}

Flora does all the wine selections and most of the dinner menu. Mary Beth makes all the desserts and the focaccia. The focaccia is literally out of this world, it's hand made daily and beyond delicious, I could eat pounds of it. Their gnocchi is also the best I've ever had, it's so light and fluffy. All of their pastas are phenomenal as well. Every single item that comes out of that kitchen is made in house and truly delicious. \n\nThe menus are hand written weekly, as they are always updating the menu depending on what is in season. Flora and Mary Beth both take so much care in this restaurant and it's one of the better dining experiences you will have in San Francisco.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-01-22", "description": "Every year all the women in our family take a trip to SF for a night of Christmas shopping. There is usually at least 12 of us and we all go out to dinner after a day of shopping. We typically book our reservations several months in advance since it is a busy time of year and always make sure we find a place that can accommodate our large group.  \nUpon calling Da Flora, we spoke with one of the owners and asked if they had an opening and if they could accommodate such a large party.  The woman was very sweet and assured us it would not be a problem.\nWhen we arrived to our reservation we were pleased to walk into such a charming place. \nWe were greeted by another woman, who apparently was the other owner of the business, not the person we spoke to on the phone months prior.  Now our group was understanding that this is a small establishment and that taking on such a large party as ourselves isn't easy and service may not be all that quick - we were all perfectly content with that because we were there to relax and enjoy each other's company with a good meal. \nTo start off on somewhat positive note - The food was good but had a bit too much garlic and salt. A few of the members of our party could not finish their meals because there was way too much salt and garlic. But we all tried each other's dishes and the food was over all very tasty.\nHowever, this was all dwarfed by the unbelievably rude woman who was waiting on us (she said she was one of the owners). We are all a very polite group - we don't fuss over little things and we are not a demanding bunch, we are not loud or obnoxious, so the behavior towards us was baffling and very unsettling. \nWhile eating our dinner and talking to one another, we noticed on several occasions the owner standing there staring at us and rolling her eyes.  Most of us didn't think anything of it, until she came over to us to clear some of the plates she continued to roll her eyes at us.  We did not say a thing to her and did not discuss the matter until we had left the restaurant, but this attitude is not okay.\n As I mentioned before, there were 12 of us and so we ordered 3 or 4 bottles of wine for the table - even though we were drinking wine, we were at no point heavily intoxicated or obnoxious patrons. But, at one point a couple members in our party wanted to have another glass of wine with their dessert.  When asking the owner for some wine by the glass (which they serve) she rudely refused and stated she didn't want to open another bottle.  Feeling like we did something wrong, we said okay and just had coffee.  \nWe finished dessert (which was delicious) and all of us feeling very unwelcome and received the bill from the owner who seemed to be even more disgruntled at this point.  Tip was included in the bill which is standard so it was easier to calculate how much was owed per person.  After counting the money (several times to ensure everyone gave enough) we ended up putting down a few dollars extra - the bill was something like $497 and we put down $500 so we didn't have to break any bills and could just get out of there.  So - even though we paid with tip included in the final bill we also left $3 over. We went outside to wait for the cabs that we called and the owner comes out in a huff saying we were $11 dollars short. What???? If we paid $500 and the bill was $497, how were we short?  We tried asking her but she just kept saying we were short.  Finally, some members of our party very frustrated at this point handed her the money just to get her away from us - if she is hurting so bad for that $11 just have it and leave us be.  \nA couple walked into the restaurant as we were leaving and were turned away by the owner because she told them \"we cant serve anyone else tonight, we don't have enough.\" It was only 8:30...\nWe will NEVER return. If it was such a hassle to accommodate our group, we would have completely understood if they told us so when we asked them when we called months prior to make our reservation. Also, to the owner that served us that evening, you are the face of your business.  If you are so miserable that you have to treat strangers in such a horrible manner then maybe you should stay behind the scenes as the owner rather than serving your customers because clearly you do not know how to treat people respectfully.", "author": "L R."}

Started with the sweet potato gnocchi. I wanted to be sitting a vat of those luscious little pillows of perfection. Also had the special tomato salad with focaccia. Also, majorly good.  For dinner two of us had the Ling Cod on Shrimp cake special and the other diner had the risotto with pancetta and mushrooms. So, so good. We used the provided fresh focaccia to wipe our plates clean. And then came dessert-- a butterscotch pot de creme that almost made me weep and chocolate bomb of some sort that looked almost too good to eat. Almost. We got over it and devoured it.   The meal, the atmosphere, the odd photo over the bathroom sink...it all worked for me so well that I tried to get a reservation for the next night to take another friend but couldn't get in. Alas, I must return to the west coast.  Thanks to Chef Jenn and Darren for creating a meal and night to remember!!", "author": "Amanda H."}

Da Flora has all the elements of a great restaurant; excellent food, great service and a very cool atmosphere. I've read all the reviews on this page and can echo all the positive reviews. Da Flora was recommended by a local who was pouring wine at Wattle Creek tasting room (another great place). He told us it was the best food in town, so we tried it. He was 100% correct! \n\nOn our first trip the owner waited on us. She was great!! Her recommendations of appetizers and wine were perfect and her personality won us over immediately. We talked with her and other staff members during our evening and had a great time. We were sold. \n\nA year later my wife and I were in SF and went to Da Flora again. When we walked in you would have thought we had eaten there every week. Everyone there remembered us a year later! How many places can you make two visits to, a year apart, and have the staff remember you? That's how Da Flora is. Some reviews call it quirky and maybe it is. But it's comfortable, friendly and a great place to eat.\n\nWe have plenty of world class restaurants here in Vegas. Restaurants with names like Flay, Legasse and Batali attached to them. Da Flora is easily in the same class with any of them and in my opinion, Da Flora beats them all!\n\nBTW, try the sweet potato gnocchi!

A limited, handwritten menu every night where certain items (e.g. lamb bolognese) are known to sell out.  Better than any tourist trap in North Beach.  Even rivals all those fancy neo-Italian restaurants in the rest of San Francisco.  Still dreaming about those sweet potato gnocchi...\n\nPorchetta Tonnato: Cooler than room temperature slices of thin roast pork spread on a platter.  The sauce on top reminded me of tuna salad, but with much more mayo than tuna.  The capers worked well to cut the mayo's richness.  Pretty dang awesome.  Definitely broke my stereotype that the only good porchetta had to be piping hot and multi-textured like Roli Roti.\n\nSweet Potato Gnocchi: No wonder why people rave about this, it is friggin' awesome!  Little dumplings of savory sweet goodness in a creamy sauce of sage and BACON!  Splitting this amongst two people only yielded 3-4 gnocchis a person, far under served in my opinion! \n\nAmatriciana: This entr\u00e9e did not exemplify their talents.  Firm penne in a somewhat bland tomato sauce.  The guanciale bacon added a fatty/smoky dimension, but still more was needed more to save the dish.  Thankfully there was a lot of grated parmesan on hand to make it tolerable.\n\nHungarian Pork: Last time I checked, there weren't many Hungarians in Venice.  Not sure how this dish got on the menu, but it was worth it!  A massive amount (more than you've ever had before in a single dish) of paprika in a red sauce.  The pork was slow roasted and fall apart tender.  Love how they used Italian dumplings (a.k.a. gnocchi) instead of that nasty starchy stuff they eat in Hungary.\n\nOrange Cake w/ Huckleberries: I only ordered this dessert because they had fresh huckleberries.  Loads of them, so it did not disappoint.  The 'cake' was rather dense, but had a great strong citrus tone, like someone took candied peel essence and put it in a muffin.", "author": "Adam B."}

They gave the place high marks for both food and service.  I don't remember what any of the reviewers said about price.\n\nI called a couple of times but the first 3 times, called in the early afternoon and got an answering machine.  Well, I never got a call back.  Strike 1\n\nThen, I called in the evening and did get someone but they were too busy to answer any questions.  Strike 2\n\nI called one more time at around 4pm and finally got a staff person  that took the time to answer  my questions regarding the menu. \n\nI use a wheelchair for mobility, so  I don't like being surprised, after having a drink before dinner, wine with dinner and maybe coffee after dinner, to find that there is no wheelchair accessible restroom that I can use.   Even after over 30 years since California Building Code requirements for accessibility were adopted and over 20 years since the Americans with Disabilities Act, a federal civil rights regulation adopted by Congress and signed into law by the first President Bush, those of us with (especially mobility) disabilities still find many (if not most) restaurants and public accommodations (businesses open to the public) that lack accessible paths-of-travel, accessible tables (typically the table bases block those of us using wheelchairs from having our laps under the table), and especially important, accessible bathrooms.\n\nWell, after the menu questions were answered by the staff person, I asked my typical questions, \"is your restaurant accessible and do you have an accessible bathroom?\".  The person asked me to hold for a moment and another person came on the phone and asked what my question was, which I repeated.  She immediately yelled, \"don't call here again!\" AND HUNG UP ON ME!\n\nI still don't know if Da Flora has an accessible bathroom that I could use but I won't be going there to find out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-02-27", "description": "I've been fantasizing about Da Flora for years; we finally went for my birthday last weekend (my bf used to be a regular but hadn't been in years).  And the place did not disappoint.  You will be hard-pressed to find better, more authentic Italian food anywhere in the city.  Anywhere.\n\nEscarole was light, delicately flavored, and a perfect start.  Sweet potato gnocchi next--this is a must.  Little pillows of freshly-made pasta & sweet potato absolutely melt in your mouth, and the pancetta adds a lovely stuffed baked potato note.  You'll want to save some of the wonderfully authentic focaccia for wiping up the leftover sauce.\n\nOsso bucco was tender & succulent, served with roast tomatoes & whipped white bean (& also left plenty of juice for wiping up with bread), & duck paperadelli was spectacular.  The freshness of the pasta, the flavor of the perfectly cooked duck, and the delicate sauce (plus fresh Parmesan) were all perfect together.  Flora, of course, chose the perfect wine to accompany both dishes, a light, Southern red that was fruity, spicy, and earthy all at the same time.\n\nFor dessert, we had a chocolate cake with caramel, dark chocolate sauce, & toasted almonds and pears baked in a tart with mascarpone and honey.  Both were fantastic.  Again, Flora suggested the perfect dessert wine for each.\n\nA $220 dinner when all was said & done, but absolutely worth every penny.\n\nA few other notes about Da Flora:\n\n1)  The place is small.  Get a reservation if you can.  If not, come early.  They close at 10, even on weekends.\n\n2)  Allow plenty of time for your meal; this is not a good place to go if you're on a tight schedule.  Flora & Mary Beth serve dinner in the traditional Italian sense of the word, which means it can take multiple hours.  (We were there for two & a half.)\n\n3)  The wine list is all small Italian wines that Flora herself selects when she visits Italy, and she knows them all insanely well.  Unless you're an expert in Italian wine (and maybe even then), just ask Flora for a recommendation.  She LOVES talking about her wines & what will go well with your food, taking into consideration a price point as well as what you like & are in the mood for.  (She is not above refusing to serve you a wine if she thinks it won't complement the food.)\n\n4)  The vibe here is not unlike that of eating at someone else's house as a guest.  I promise you that if you behave accordingly, you will have a fabulous time, and if you don't, you may find yourself feeling somewhat less welcome.  (Some people who gave low reviews remarked on Flora & Mary Beth having their 'favorite' customers whom they dote upon.  I'm sure this is absolutely true.  You know who their favorites are?  People who conduct themselves with grace and class, and don't act like this is freaking Applebee's.)  These ladies have enough of a devoted cult following that they don't have to court customers who piss them off.\n\nSooooo worth it.  An absolute must if you like good Italian food & wine, & aren't a douchey boor.", "author": "Angela B."}

No, the decor is not trendy and sexy, nor should it be. Hardwood tables and mis-matched chairs. A floor that was last laid in probably the 70s or 80s. This place looks like it was lifted out of Venice and dropped in North Beach.\n\nDon't you dare ask for a Chardonnay or a Cab.

Next the squid ink tagliatelle was also decent, but with a tomato base it lacked the salty and citrus flavor profile that goes so well with the black pasta. Chicken paprikash, though an odd pick for a Italian meal, was highly recommended by our server as the owner is also Hungarian. This dish also featured gnocchi, this version regular potato, seared, light, and delicious. Sadly, the sauce was a bit bland. On the plus side the decor is beautiful, elegant but simple.

Bottom line is, I grew up with my Grandma Carmella's gnocchi as the gold standard. I've been on a quest to find gnocchi that measured up my entire life, including the 9 months I spent studying in Italy. The sweet potato gnocchi here measures up; in fact, if I were being entirely honest I might even say it surpasses my grandma's (please don't hate me, Grandma!). In addition to that, Da Flora is the epitome of romantic. The lighting, the paint, the restroom, the hand written menus,  the tables - all fabulous. Thank you for an evening that will always be among my favorite memories!", "author": "About A."}

Bread excellent, fabulous even; ditto gnocchi and desserts.  I thought the entree was so-so, consistently.   Also, as noted by other reviewers, the two women running the place lacked a little something in the area of class and good manners.\n\nWe went back to Da Flora's on Friday night.  We were surprised and saddened that the gnocchi wasn't delightful anymore.  The \"pillows\" were heavy.  Dessert was very ordinary.  The spinach manicotti was dreadful.  One of the women running the place was friendly (for a change) and the bread was spectacular, so it gets two stars.

Several people that walked through the door were greeted with a hug from the owner. They prefer cash & ask that you don't use your cell phones (I'm a fan of the no cell phone usage during dinner btw). The menu changes daily, but the one thing that is always available is the homemade focaccia bread. This was hands down the BEST focaccia I've ever had. I would go back just for the bread alone. It was crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, had a hint of salt, and was lightly coated in olive oil. We ate two full plates of it between the two of us, and for once in my life I didn't feel guilty about the carbs because they were worth every bite. We had the stuffed artichoke for a starter. I expected it to be served warm, instead of cold, but it was still really good. The crunch of the breadcrumbs and the tender artichoke heart was a great contrast. My dinner companion had the halibut served over asparagus. He thought it was a little bland. I had the risi bisi: risotto with fresh peas. Great flavors & texture. Not too rich, and very filling. Overall I really enjoyed the meal and the ambiance. The prices were on the higher side, but fairly average for NB.

The changing daily menu of innovative Northern Italian cuisine, charming ambiance and personal touches by the proprietors makes this Venetian restaurant shine in a neighborhood overrun by touristy Italian restaurants.  \n\nI was looking for a great date night restaurant in North Beach, and I remembered the stellar reviews for Da Flora on Check Please Bay Area.  When I walked into the restaurant, I felt like I had been transported to a cozy, little spot in Europe that had been in operation for decades.  I was even more impressed when I opened the menu and found a handwritten list of primo and secondo dishes.    \n\nWe started with the sweet potato gnocchi which was served with the sage sauce instead of bacon sherry sauce since I'm pescatarian.  It was delicious as a vegetarian dish, so the dish definitely deserves the title of their house special.  For our main courses, we had the trout over zucchini and the squid ink risotto.  I've never been a huge fan of squid ink dishes, but the creamy texture and spicy sauce of the risotto literally stopped our conversation mid-sentence when we tasted it.\n\nMy only regret is that we didn't have time to try their dessert, which is made my the same baker who does their amazing focaccia bread.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-12", "description": "This restaurant is the best high-end Italian you will find in the city.  The food is excellent, the wine is excellent, and the atmosphere is a pure delight and a welcome escape from the sterile, flat-screen peppered trend traps that seem to be taking over the universe these days.  I am a concierge, and I regularly recommend Da Flora to my guests, especially when they are planning a birthday or anniversary dinner.  Not one of my guests has ever been disappointed by the cuisine or by the service there.  \n\nI will say that Da Flora is very strict with their reservation policy (as one would expect of any high-end restaurant), so if you do arrive late without calling ahead or if you walk in expecting to be immediately seated without a reservation, you will likely not have a pleasant outcome.  The reasonable and respectful thing to do would be to make a reservation ahead of time and arrive on time.  It is true that the owners can be brusque at times, but they are running a small independent business, and if they have other people arriving at set times, they can't just give up their tables to you if you arrive late with no advance notice or if you walk in off the street expecting immediate service just because there happen to be a few tables empty at that particular moment.  \n\nI have found that the owners generally tend to reflect the attitudes that are presented to them, and while this might not be the most ingratiating approach to adopt in the field of hospitality, it is as it is, so all patrons might do well to keep it in mind.\n\nA direct response to a couple of ratings below: if you want or need something in life and find you are not getting it, ask for it.  I have never seen anyone at this restaurant ignore anyone on purpose, but when there are two owners and one server covering a whole roomful of people, it isn't suprising that every so often something small gets overlooked.  What I want to know is, what kind of person sits passive-aggressively back without saying a word for 40 minutes while his water glass sits unfilled?  I guess the same kind of person who would taunt a fellow reviewer for misspelling \"potato\" when he can't even spell \"gnocchi\", after talking himself up as the world's biggest foodie for a couple of paragraphs.  \n\nAnyway, no more venting--this restaurant is among the very best in the city, and it is a must-visit for every local and for any discerning tourist.  I have nothing but respect and appreciation for Da Flora.", "author": "Tara D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-13", "description": "In a nutshell: pretty good food, lousy service.\n\nWe came to Da Flora on the recommendation of  my mother, who stumbled upon it while staying nearby and liked it. As locals, we rarely venture to North Beach for food because most restaurants are so touristy. This is not one of those places, and the promise of sweet potato gnocchi with bacon lured us in.\n\nWe arrived to our reservation a bit late, and though the restaurant was half empty, the owner (whose nickname from other reviews I shall not repeat) looked pained but allowed us to sit anyway. Fine. Our eyes lit up and our mouths watered when we glimpsed the listing of the gnocchi, and this was immediately forgotten.\n\nNow, this is one of those Italian places with a Primi and Secondi menu. I never feel obligated to order one from column A and one from column B. This can be a lot of food, and do I really want two pasta dishes? Maybe I want a salad and a pasta and not a meat dish. Or maybe I don't consider pasta an appetizer. But when I tried to order the Caesar Salad and the gnocchi (as did others in our party), I was informed that the gnocchi was an appetizer, and she'd come back when we figured out what we really wanted. Odd. \n\nWell, guess what? That's what we really wanted. So when she came back, we repeated our order. She got that pained look again, and said that she'd give some of us a full size (read: twice as expensive) portion of the gnocchi. Later, we had the opportunity to compare the size of the \"full\" portion and the normal portion. Double the price for 20% more gnocchi is not what I wanted to order.\n\nBut the fun doesn't stop there. We wanted to get wine, but they only had them listed by the bottle. So we asked if they had wines by the glass. She told us we should get a bottle. Because... some of us want red and some of us want white. So, instead of getting the list, she picked wine for us (which could be charming, had we not already encountered being told what to order), all without mentioning the price - $12 each as it turned out.\n\nThe rest of the meal was fine. Well, except that we never got any water. We ordered dessert and ended up with a $160 bill for the 3 of us, so it's not like we came in intending to be el cheapo. But we came away feeling like they thought we were trying to short change them and looked down upon because we're 20somethings (Guess what? Our money is good too). I understand that it's a small place and they have limited seating. So have a minimum per person or prix fixe. But don't tell me what I can and can't order or try to guilt me into ordering more or something different than what I want. \n\nIn some way, it was a valuable experience. I won't tolerate such rudeness in any restaurant again. Had there been any other good restaurants in the area that we knew about nearby, we would have just left at the start. As it was, at least we got a good story out of it.", "author": "Dan F."}

It was absolutely outrageous the way we were treated.  \n\nThe sad part is the food was actually delicious.  So if you happen to be looking to be treated like human garbage for a night by a bunch of Viking women, then this is the place for you.  Otherwise avoid this place at all costs.", "author": "Dan L."}

I'm so full.\n\nI went here tonight a bit skeptical about going to get another overpriced, mediocre Italian restaurant in North Beach.\n\nWe started with the sweet potato gnocchi w/ pancetta. The best gnocchi ever. Perfectly cooked so the texture was so good. The sweet potato was subtle and the sauce with pancetta was a perfect complement... yum. \n\nI had the pappardelle pasta with lamb bolognese sauce. The pappardelle is hand made and was again, perfectly cooked - not too el dente, and not mushy; it had the perfect homey texture. So good. The sauce was flavorful and well-seasoned. The pasta was piping hot and it just tasted fresh. I'm sure it was a zillion calories, but the dish wasn't greasy. Perfect sauce to pasta ratio too. This is the best bowl of pasta I've had in a very, very long time.\n\nWe had the strawberry rhubarb crisp w/ vanilla ice cream. Yum. Again, fresh, flavorful and not too sweet or rich and oily. Just delicious.\n\nI do think this place is a little expensive... but worth it. You can tell that the food is homemade with quality ingredients. A glass of wine (by the glass), shared gnocchi dish, main pasta and shared dessert will run you nearly $50! So good.... \n\nYes, the service was a little rough around the edges, but not nearly as awful as some other reviewers described. I found the service fine and the staff polite. My friends had dined here before and expressed that they were intimidated by the owners. As soon as we stepped in, my friends became so behaved, overly polite and timid. haha. \n\nI will definitely come back here. ymmm", "author": "Cindy Y."}

I haven't had a bad meal along Columbus yet, but this place does enough to distinguish itself from all of the other Italian restaurants. They definitely make an effort to create an intimate dining atmosphere and provide very personal service to each table.  One of the standouts on the menu for me was the butternut squash gnocchi (if you're into that sort of thing) but really everything I tasted that night was great. The bread comes out drizzled in olive oil ready to go to. One interesting thing to note is that because they use hand pressed Ventian menus, the appetizers and entrees must be ordered together to avoid getting any food debris on the delicate material.

Scores of obnoxious drunk drivers in SUVs is not one of them. Da Flora, however,  is.\n\nRomantic, cozy, off the tourist track, it really was such nice surprise compared to the zoo known as \"A North Beach Saturday Night\".  We had later reservations (9pm) and by that time, much of the food was already out. I ended up getting the gnocchi appetizer served as an entree, which although good, ended up being too rich for as a full serving. However, we also ordered the scallops and they really were amazing...and I don't even LIKE scallops. Wine was perfectly paired and the butterscotch pot de creme was a perfect cap to the meal.  \n\nThe prices are a little steep, but I'm keeping the four star rating - primarily because the bathroom reminded me of  the bathrooms in my grandfather's old  Victorian, perched high on an SF hill and perpetually enshrouded in fog. I don't get nostalgic about many things, but my grandfather's house is an exception. So yes, Da Flora keeps it four star rating for an entirely irrational reason.

It made me feel like I was in Venice.\n\nThe chef is absolutely fearless.  She uses ingredients that might scare some people off, but those who are brave and strong will be amply rewarded.  You will not be greeted by a mini-skirted hottie, you will not have a simpering waiter who tells you his name, you will not get exactly the same menu as the place up the street. What you will get is amazing unique food and, if you're courteous, friendly, unhurried service.\n\nThey started by giving us a plate of oil-drizzled homemade focaccia.  I tend to shy away from focaccia (this from a bread-lover) because it is so often cardboard-y.  Not at da Flora.  This was fresh and homemade and delicious.  \n\nWe shared speck-wrapped asparagus and pork with tuna sauce.  Both were fabulous.   Then my husband got a pasta dish with garlic and onions and anchovies.  I don't like anchovies, so I didn't have any, but he was in heaven.  I got the petrale, grilled perfectly, on a delicious bed of zucchini patty.  We had planned on going for a walk after dinner and stopping at an Italian bakery for dessert, but the food was so good that we decided to stay and split the pistachio cake on meyer lemon creme fraiche.  Oh my god - it was easily on my top ten ever dessert list.\n\nI looked at some of the bad reviews before I went.  Good lord - who the hell pans a restaurant because he asks for a table at peak time and just wants a glass of wine, then gets pissy because they won't make his wife a cappuchino.  Go somewhere else.

So for all those that get a little queasy thinking about a plate of alfredo, read on; all others, ignore this review.  \n\nSo I didn't barf, but I have felt like sheit ever since last night's dinner.  To start, my boy and I split the gnocchi.  Which was very tasty and probably the best made gnocchi I have had in the city.  Unfortunately, it was covered in and a thick cream sauce that had super fatty pieces of bacon in it.  I had a couple of half bites... You know when you stop mid-chew because you know you have just sunk your teeth into something that it is just pure fat... cringe.  I am gagging just thinking about it. \n\nNext I had the lamb shank, which was excellent.  The meat was really flavorful and fell right off the bone.  But again, there were big chunks of fat in it.  And because the lighting was so dim in the restaurant, I couldn't determine what I was eating.  So yes, I had some phenomenal bites of delicious lamb, but  the next bite tended to be an entire mouthful of grody fat.  (cringe)  ...My eyes are tearing at the thought...  I must note that one of my dining companions did not seem to notice at all and, to my horror, ate the whole thing (gag). So maybe everyone loves eating hunks of fat and I am simply the oddball... It wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThe desserts (I don't remember exactly what they were as they were never read - they were just told to us) were hit and miss.  There was a cookie platter, which is passable, and a phenomenal fruit-like cake with a sour creamish topping.  As my boyfriend said, next time we should just get the whole cake and forgo dinner.  The cake was really good.\n\nAll in all, if there was no fat on my plate I would have given Da Flora 4 stars, but since it tainted almost every bite I took, I am going with 2 stars.  Also, the service was really slow, I needed to practically beg for an entree recommendation, and it is 1:30 the following day and I still feel yucky.\n\nAnd no, I will not be back.", "author": "Hayley W."}

Excuse me, but if you have lamb on the menu, you should put the lamb in the oven so that it's ready for when guests arrive! \n\n I ordered the lettuce and watermelon radish salad and the dressing seemed like nothing more than olive oil.  Being an avid cook, I understand the power of a dressing of nothing more than a good quality olive oil, but this dressing completely fell flat. For $9, I already felt ripped off.  Then, I had the orichette pasta with rapini.  It wasn't orichiette at all! It was fusilli and completely devoid of any flavor.  I had to keep adding salt ...just to taste it! I can't believe I paid $19 for a pasta that I could have thrown together for $3 at home. \n\nAll in all, if you're tastes are used to the Olive Garden, feel free to go to Da Flora.

Now - it's down to a 2.  Why?  I got food poisoning one night after eating there.  I don't lower my rating because I got sick - that happens at any restaurant.  I lower my rating because I called to let them know I got food poisoning and NEVER received a call back.  I would expect a place like this to call their customers back and at least apologize.  That's all I was looking for.  So, it get a two in my book and not sure I need to go back. \n\n\nFirst Review: (4 stars)\nDon't expect any attention when you walk into this place, unless you have a reservation and don't take it personally if the owners don't give you the time of day.  You need to work up your reputation at this place.  If you walk in off the street, you're considered 'riffraff' which is probably what happened with us.  My mom had been there before and warned me that if we walk in there without reservations, it's not going to be welcomed.  Once we got over the fact that we didn't get any attention for the first 15 minutes of being seated, the owners started warming up and I could see how great this place is!  \n\nThe ambiance is spectacular, food is wonderful (the menu is constantly changing (--feels like you're in Italy with the handwritten menu with about 10 items) and wine selection is top notch.  These two ladies know their wine and let them pick something out for you once you decide what you're ordering!  The sea scallops are delicious and orecchiette with broccoli rabe is delicious!  \n\nThe only thing holding me back from having this a 5 star is the 'standoff-ish' attitude you get as a new comer.", "author": "Katie T."}

Red walls, maroon draperies, and candlelit. The restaurant is almost hidden from the outside world which adds to its appeal. \n\nThe waiters must have been in a more loving mood (in comparison to past reviews) since I found them to be pretty friendly. They were helpful in the wine selection and were prompt on the bread delivery. Ahhhhhh the BREAD-amazing! Salty, fried foccacia bread, nothing like it. Kind of like a salty donut which just melted in your mouth. I was beyond pleased already. \n\nThe salads, however, were nothing to write home about. I ordered a crab salad on cabbage and the crab had a \"fresh can/linoleum\" taste to it. And the combo over the bitter cabbage and raddicio did not mesh well together. My date's salad resembled that of leaves with some chunky unidentifiable cheese. He wasn't too happy either. At this point we were a little taken back already and were curious as to how the pasta dishes would pan out. I was pleased with my pea raviolis with shrimp and would definitely recommend it. An odd combination that was surprisingly tasty. My date's gnocchi was eh......he/we have definitely had better and it didn't live up to its hype. \n\nThe main entree: braised short ribs. Pre-tty good. Served with polenta and broccoli. I did notice a few dollops of sour cream which was both unneccessay and unpleasant. The ribs were seasoned enough as is. \n\nOverall a solid 3 stars.

I can make a better ceaser at a salad bar at Sizzler.  \n\nI had a pasta dish with a lamb ragu.  Although it was for the most part okay, I thought that the very soft cooked carrots that were part of the dish did NOT compliment it in the slightest, and gave the dish a taste that reminded me of beef stew.

I went with a new group of people last night, and they all absolutely loved the food and ambiance. It's just a homerun kind of place... unless you have some freak in your party who doesn't eat carbs (BORING). \n\nTo say that parking in No. Beach is a Second Bardo nightmare, which might keep you from ever getting around to try this restaurant, would be an understatement - last night we discovered that there is a public parking lot right across the street from Da Flora - BONUS! \n\nI also appreciate that the servers consistently suggest delicious and moderately-priced wine pairings (instead of trying to shame you into ordering one of the most expensive bottles).\n\nOriginal review 9/24: \n\nTruly the tastiest Italian food I've ever had and such a CUTE, cozy, romantic, unique restaurant. The staff is wonderful and personable, too.\n\nSmall criticisms/warnings: \nYou have to get there early, or there's a good chance they will have run out of a good chunk of the menu - including the gnocchi, which rumor has it is their most fantastic dish (and I didn't get to try!! Oh darn, now I have to go back). Also, they only use unpasteurized/raw milk cheeses  (according to our waitress), so if you're pregnant you have to steer clear of the cheese (and as far as I'm concerned food is just a vehicle for cheese, so that was a bit of a bummer for me).\n\nOverall a fantastic package, though - I hope to go back again and again.", "author": "rachel m."}

So last night we finally went back for round two. Wow, it was fantastic! Even better than I remembered it.\n\nI came upon Da Flora through \"Check Please Bay Area\" and have been gastronomically uplifted. This is a wonderful restaurant and it's understandable that most of the people there are regulars.\n\nOn our first time we had Da Flora's fantastic signature dish of sweet potato gnocchi with a bacon sherry creme sauce- oh my god, it's beyond heavenly, that dish is fucking orgasmic. We also had penne amatriciana with house-cured pork cheek, which was also very good. Then we had some kind of fish dish, maybe skate - I just don't remember all these months later.\n\nFlora also helped us pick out a bottle of great Italian red wine, something that she really excells at. They ONLY serve Italian wines so I needed some help choosing.\n\nThe second time we went (last night) to start we had the sweet potato gnocchi and the porchetta tonnato (carpacio-thin sliced pork loin with a tuna fish/mayonnaise sauce) which was also fantastic - an interesting combination that really works. After eating both of these appetizers we decided that just the one gnocchi wasn't enough, so we ordered a second (I've never ordered a second round of any dish in any restaurant before!!) Each bite was pure bliss. And the focaccia was perfect for soaking up ALL the delectable gnocchi cream sauce\n\nFor entrees we had a fantastically flavorfull risotto with grape tomatoes and an unsatisfying monkfish with lentils, chanterelle mushrooms and arugula, which was a little bland. I would have prefered some kind of meat: lamb, pork or beef; unfortunately, the menu only had a Hungarian paprika chicken dish, the monkfish and 5 pasta dishes. The monkfish didn't fulfill us (we should have ordered the chicken), but the other dishes went beyond expectation.\n\nFor dessert we had the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream. Funny thing, a restaurant patron came up to us and told us this dessert was not to be missed. So, we ordered his recommendation and the apple crisp was certainly very good, but it wasn't all that. My partner, who was facing the dining room, said that she noticed that everyone else was eating the apple crisp too. Only a warm apple crisp would have been noteworthy. So, I suspect they were out of the warm out-of-the-oven apple crisps and we got a cold lackluster one. However, I'm not going to deduct any stars because 3 of the dishes were so utterly to-die-for and I will be going back more often.\n\nWe brought a bottle of 2005 Rochioli Pinot Noir, which was OUTSTANDING and paid the $20.00 corkage fee. I felt bad not inviting Flora to pick us out a bottle of Italian wine from her huge selection, but I was dying to drink this pinot.\n\nI love this restaurant and want to become a regular patron too. Thank you Da Flora restaurant for 2 outstanding meals.", "author": "Yvette K."}

We were lucky there was a 1-hour window to the next reservation. The hostess/owner was kind enough to seat us. Note that I did not see a restaurant name since apparently some drunk preppy kid (owners words) had taken a bat to her window. That's north beach for you. I thank my lucky stars that I did a double peek into their window and was enticed by their cozy space. \n\nThis place is great!! I hate hate hate North beach on a saturday night but this time I had no choice as my mom wanted to see San Francisco. The tourist trap that is north beach is normally such a pain, but now that I've discovered Da Flora, I am feeling much better about the trek. \n\nFirst off, its small. +1 Secondly, the menus are also small and handwritten! +1 The bathroom is so quaint and cute! And the wine selection is very good. \n\nWe shared a blood orange salad that was dressed in a wonderful vinagrette, topped with thinly shaved red onions and green and black olives. Served with nicely salted bread to mop up the vinagrette. \n\nMy mom had the buttersquash risotto with swiss chard. It was perfectly  cooked and the chard was a nice contrast to the creamy risotto. I had the lamb bolognese sugo on handmade parpadelle. It was divine!!! We both had a glass of wine made from a grape whose name I will mess up .. la grime it sounded like. I will have to google it. It had a lovely deep color with a very smooth finish. Found it .. its called lagrein! \n\nThe bill came up to $77 excluding tip. It was a little pricey but well worth it.

Where do I start?\n\n5 of us needed a last minute reservation away from downtown because Macworld had taken over the city, with friends were in town from Australia for this ungodly convention that clogs up our fair city.  We fortunately got in!\n\nWe started with the white bean bruscetta, baked asparagus with some kind of sour dough breadcrumb, and the gnocchi.  Holy smokes.  I am dreaming of that gnocchi right now.  It's the fluffiest, lightest, sweet potatoed piece of heaven you can imagine.  Pieces of thick cut bacon, crispy sage and a light cream sauce.  That Jen in the kitchen sure knows what she's doing, it's incredible.  All of it was. It was one of those situations where you wish there were not 5 people.  I wanted to order another round of appetizers!\n\nTwo had the pork chop and 3 the ravioli.  It was all amazing.   The handwritten menu is cute and fun and writing this review  I am tempted to go back in tonight with just one rather than five and share a few more things (but I won't).  I will, however...hit it up soon.  We shared creme brulee, some kind of chocolate cake and a berry cobbler thing with vanilla ice cream.  All astounding.\n\nI had been here once before with my parents and it was awesome.  I made an observation to them that I'd bet we could get our palms read or get tarot carded here;  the atmosphere is dark and romantic but not so much that unromantic liaison's like one with your parents or 4 friends seem weird or out of place.

The owner does seem to come off like she is burdened by life but she wasn't rude.  The rest of the staff was friendly and attentive to refilling glasses and checking back on whether you enjoyed the food or needed anything else.\n\nIt's a small place. You need to have a reservation if you expect to get a table, especially on weekends.\n\nThe foccacia is really excellent - it's airy and lighter instead of dense and heavy and he olive oil that is drizzled on top is quite delicate.\n\nThe sweet potato gnocchi was tasty enough but not to die for. You wouldn't want more than the appetizer size portion because otherwise expect it to sit heavy. It's best shared with someone along with the Caesar salad which is very authentic tasting\n\nI was surprised that there were not more proteins on the menu. There was a fish dish but otherwise everything else was a pasta. I had the parpadelle which was served that night with a hearty lamb ragu sauce. It was excellent. The best dish all night. My friend had the sole which was cooked just right, very moist.\n\nFor dessert we tried the chocolate shortbread sandwiches with the filling of mascarpone cheese and honey. While very good, the cookies were too thin and I would have preferred a bigger bang of intense chocolate. We also tried the pistashio-lemon-almond cake - the lemon was the predominant flavor, you couldn't taste any almond or pistashio really. It's a stickier cake, maybe it is made with almond paste. The cake grows on you the more you eat it.

The owner/hostess/somelier/waitress and all around bad-ass was totally cool, especially since Tom and Tom were regulars.\n\nThe wine list is all Italian to the best of my knowledge and I'm lost in Italy when it comes to wines, only knowing a few but...the whites and reds recommended were just great. I told her I'm a full bodied big dark dried fruit with a long finish and low tannin kind of guy with my reds and she hit the mark. I prefer my whites in the same depth but would be fresh stone fruit as opposed to the red, big fan of Riesling characteristics but also of a little malo-lactic fermentation so that buttery finish...again hit the mark.\n\nFood...I started with a Artichoke stuffed with bread crumbs/garlic/parsley and olives, nice and thin lemon aoli surrounded it. The only criticism I had were that a couple of the outer fibrous leaves weren't removed. But other than that I loved it and finished before I realized like a jackass I didn't give everyone a taste. They all started with fava bean puree on toast with I believe some lemon extra virgin sprinkled on top. Nice and fresh, an itty bitty touch of garlic but bright and a nice little \"summer's here\" starter.\n\nI had Red wine braised duck livers which were awesome, mama had the sweet potato gniochi which lived up to the hype. Perfect little pillows in a light cream sauce, very good and I can make some gniochi lemme tell YOU. Tom had the mushroom risotto  which was perfectly done, a lot of the time people will finish with to much Parmesan but this had just enough. I forgot what the other Tom got but I think I remember a braised red meat of some type on polenta, Tom ate it so fast didn't get a bite but he and others vouched for it.\n\nWe shared the strawberry shortcake and these little stuffed macaroons. I'm some what of a strawberry conesuer and since it was so early in the season for them it was obvious from the flavor and the fact that they had the tell tail sheen on them from having sugar sprinkled.

No fat on the bacon, which was the tastiest and smokiest bacon I've ever had.\n\nThe osso bucco was amazingly tasty but as others have said, there is way too much fat for $26. Probably 20 percent of the dish was fat.  Detracts from the thing overall, but I'd still order it again, that's how good it was.\n\nButterleaf salad was great.  Raw garlic in a salad dressing is questionable, so garlic-phobes might not like it.  But to us the dressing was perfect.\n\nThe staff was attentive and friendly, granting us repeated changes to our reservation.  Our waitress, not one of the two owners, was accomodating, never rushed us, was responsive without being hyper, was there when we needed her, and left us alone when that's what we wanted.  The owners even treated my girlfriend and I (who were celebrating a milestone) to a $5 table-side poloroid, taken by a neighborhood eccentric who was welcomed by them with open arms.  (Note: if you do not want a friendly enough interuption to your dining experience, pass on the solicitation... quickly.)\n\nApple crisp with vanilla ice cream was great as well.. the crisp was the perfect light counterpart to the heavy-ness of the ice cream.\n\nLastly, unlike what some other yelpers have said, they do in fact take Visa and MC, they just prefer cash.\n\nOverall a near perfect experience.

In my party: three close pals, one of whom, T, lived in Rome till the age of 29. \n\nI was told ahead of time that one of the waitresses is the sweetest lady ever, while the other one is...for lack of better words, Shrek. \"How would I be able to tell them apart?\" I asked naively; \"Oh you'll know.\" okay. so off we go.\n\nAs usual i was late, my buddy was already seated at a perfectly sized table - actually, the decor was pleasant. Red walls, wooden tables and chairs, fairly comfy setting. it wasn't cramped, and was pleasantly lit. The overall vibe was just quaint.\n\nSo, as my friend had predicted, i had no trouble spotting Shrek. She floated about the joint with the authority and grace of Jabba the Hut, and looked as lovely as Valerie, wife of Miracle Max.  As I tiptoed around her to join my friend, i felt her dirty look washing over me. I smiled at her sweetly and sat down, keeping my voice level strictly inside. My co-worker friend happened to be sitting next table with her husband, so i went by and said hellos. At one point I uttered the phrase \"Yelp Review\" and was prompted shuushed by my regularly visiting friends - apparently, that's the express train ticket to Shrek's shitlist-shire. I tipped toed back to my table, and soon my italian friend joined us. \n\nAs suggested by fellow helpful Yelpers, my group decided to defer our wine selection to Lady Shrek. We also told LS that our friend is italian, and they started to chat table side (totally charming, if i weren't so awash in fear, i'd enjoyed listening, instead i just smiled politely while looking like a total tard.)  Shrek seemed truly delighted to practice her italian with my Roma friend. Turns out that she's hungarian, and had lived near venice for a long time and had worked at a kitchen there. Hence, when she came to the states, she opened up an italian joint. Oh, and she suggested the $45/bottle wine. surprise. We ordered 1 plate of \"legendary sweet potato gnocci\" to share to share among the 4 of us. This displeased Lady of the Hut; but since my italian friend was there, she was still rather gracious about our grave error, childing us for potentially inconveniencing her, \"I will just have to go tell the chef to make this again when you guys reorder!\" Drama Mia! \n\nOur wine came. Me, being a wine simpleton/novice, could only tell that the wine is somewhat lame, and especially in relation to the price. Later on a huddle revealed that the \"cellar-y\" wine perhaps has \"turned.\" Again, no idea what this means - so maybe just be extra careful about committing to the wine based on the price. The wine list is extensive, Jabba the Shrek boasted about 200 types supposedly. but that could also just be marketing babble.  It's hard to tell since the woman seem to lack the \"warmth and sincerity\" gene.\n\nNo complaints about the food. The sweet potato gnocchi was indeed delicious. (Mrs Miracle Max will tell you that the menu is designed so that each guest can consume a primi and a second, that is true only if you're training for your next competitive eating contest. My table of four shared a plate of the gnocchi for app, and each ordered an entree, and I had some left overs and was ssstttuuufffed; find you, my appetite is not to be trifled with usually, so this is not the appetite of a salad-eating gal here.) For the record, I had the Tagliatalle with Ridicchio - and even with the fearful service, I'm tempted to go back again (but i know better, esp after this self-indulgent review). \n\nTo sum up my feelings - visiting Da Flora is not unlike having dinner at your bipolar spinster aunt's house, (the one that is afflicted with the hairy chin.) The food may be delicious,  but you're just a little too scared to breathe to enjoy it.  Plus, that supposedly pricey wine is just kind of iffy.", "author": "Lynn T."}

We planned on celebrating his birthday there. I had told them it was for his birthday when I made the reservation, and they made a note of it. We made the reservations a month in advance.\n\nTo confirm our reservation, I called Da Flora on Friday, March 7th. Reaching their voicemail system, I heard that they were only accepting reservations from women in honor of International Women's Day. I left a voicemail asking that they call me and tell me what was happening with our reservation. They returned the phone call to cancel the reservation.\n\nLet me say that I fully support their decision to honor women on International Women's Day and respect their decision to have a women's only night. After all, my partner and I learned about their restaurant on Check Please! Bay Area, where they highlighted that Da Flora is owned by two women, somewhat of a rarity in the restaurant world, and we wanted to support a women-owned business and have his birthday celebration. Plus, all three panelists on Check Please! Bay Area raved about the food, the ambiance, and the customer service.\n\nThe problems were two-fold. First, the woman who returned my call said they tried to call me. However, I never had a missed 415-area-code phone call without a voicemail, nor did I receive a voicemail. I believe that I would have remembered my partner's birthday plans being canceled. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt, but it sounds like an excuse for not letting us know that our reservations weren't being honored.\n\nWhat would have happened if I didn't call to confirm? Would we have been turned away at the last minute on Saturday?\n\nThe second problem - and I may be most perturbed about this - she offered no follow-up offer of service. It would have been nice if she offered us a table on Sunday, perhaps with a free dessert, glasses of bubbly, just something. She offered tacit platitudes and nothing else. Even after I reminded her that it was for my partner's birthday and asked her if there was anything that she could do, she did nothing.\n\nMy partner and I select restaurants to try based on recommendations, and customer service for special occasions is of paramount importance to us. They knew that we made the reservation for his birthday, and they did not care. \n\nAt the last minute, Da Flora canceled our reservations for my partner's birthday. They barely offered an apology. They did not offer any follow-up service. If we had shown up without confirming the reservation, we would have been turned away without notice. That is what I call poor customer service - to say the least. \n\nA copy of this letter has been posted with or emailed to Yelp, Trip Advisor, and Michael Bauer.", "author": "Justin J."}

Yes, Mary Beth's focaccia was near perfection.  We are in the wine trade, so it was puzzling not to find more current vintages on the brief, one-page listing of Italian white wines.  First we learned from our server (who boldly announced herself as the \"wine buyer\"), who we later realized was the owner Flora, that the wine we requested was unavailable because it was not chilled down.  After we agreed to wait while the wine was properly chilled, we were then informed that this wine was no longer available.  After listening to Flora try to convince us that a red wine would pair with our food (which it wouldn't), we finally convinced her to tell us about some other Italian white wines available, but not listed on the wine list.  We selected a 2004 Greco di Tufo from Campania that proved to be excellent!  However, when we asked for the wine to be rested on ice to keep it slightly chilled, we were informed that the restaurant did not have any ice!!!???  \r\n \r\nIt was a rainy Tuesday evening about 8 o'clock, and the restaurant was less than half-full.  Throughout the rest of our dining experience, we felt like we were a complete afterthought, although we were the only ones seated in the middle of the room.  This included waiting for my empty wine glass to be replenished (the wine bottle was not left on the table), while Flora sat at a table 3 feet behind me clipping newsprint articles about the restaurant for a scrapbook.  Flora never did make the effort; we finally had to flag down her compatriot Mary Beth for assistance.\r\n \r\nThe final insult was getting someone to bring the check/take our credit card so we could close out our bill.  By the way, the menu reads that cash is preferred.  (Upon reading this notice when we were seated, we made a point in letting Flora know that we only had enough cash for a taxi, and would a credit card be okay?  We were assured it would not be a problem.)  So, we waited, and waited, and waited, while Mary Beth stood with her back to our table visiting with acquaintances at a table along the wall.  Flora continued clipping.  Finally, my wife stood up and put on her coat with great drama for attention, but no one noticed.  After my wife politely interrupted Mary Beth, our AMEX card was whisked away, only to be returned a minute later with the explanation that this was not an accepted card.  We kind of figured it wouldn't be, but were startled that the card had to actually be \"swiped\" before anyone woke up to pay attention.\r\n \r\nPerhaps we should have picked up the subtle clues the moment we walked in- BAM!  You're in the middle of the restaurant (nothing to create a soft entry- for you or the diners seated near the icy blast of cold as you enter from the street)... the tired, kitchy decor (NOT romantic, as others would leave you to believe; peeling floor tiles are not attractive, nor are dusty dingy artifacts strewn about)...  the slovenly attire of personnel (yeah, we know it's North Beach, we know it's cold, we'd like you to be comfortable, but please dress in clean, professional garb and put on a happy face)...  and the grossest moment of the evening, when Flora placed a dirty (I mean not just fingerprints- this thing never ever saw a dishwasher!) wine glass in front of the wife and had to be asked (nicely I might add!) \"May I have a different wine glass?\"", "author": "Eric S."}

Let me put it this way, I took my parents here and if my mom is not complaining you know somebody did something right! The sweet potato gnocchi is out of this world...and I hate sweet potato!! The foccacia was like something straight out of my Nonna's kitchen and the main course was to die for. The menu is interesting and adventuresome, changing daily...a refreshing change for NB. Moving right along...\nLETS TALK DESSERT!!!! OMG, I could have died right here and been a happy girl. I had a plum and bluberries tart with vanilla ice cream that was one of the best things I have ever tasted!\nReservations are a must...as is not skipping a single course or leaving a single bite behind...\n\nPS Bring cash...they dont take plastic...", "author": "Jess W."}

It was open, and we were walking by, so we thought we'd see if they had room.\n\nThe food here was definitely the best Italian food in North Beach.  The other restaurants aren't anything significantly different from a chain restaurant like Del Pomodoro.  But this one...Fresh ingredients, unique recipes.  And the bread!  Fabulous.  If I had to pick a word, I'd pick exquisite.\n\nThe service was great.  We even went with our six year old son, and they treated him like royalty.  They even made him a small dish of tomato sauce when the pasta he ordered was too anchovy-ish.  \n\nIf you want something in North Beach worth the extra money, this is it.

Two Buck Chuck is equally tasty and palatable.  I was aghast that between appetizers, entrees, and wine, our meal ended up in the neighborhood of $60/person.  This was, at most, at $30/person kind of place.  I've had way better, fresher, and more unique Italian food for much less money, and I didn't have to go all the way to the outskirts of North Beach to get it.  I think the only return customers they have there are those kinds of people who firmly believe that you can't get a decent meal for less than $50, and just refuse to eat at restaurants that serve better but oh no, CHEAPER food.

Flora is outstanding.  Her menus, which are created daily and are handwritten, include wonderful food.  Please try the gnocchi as a starter.  Her foccacia (served as bread before the meal) is the only foccacia I have had in North Beach that actually tastes like the foccacia in Italy.  For your meal, if you're not sure, ask Flora - she will give you her honest opinions (unlike many restaurants who want you to just buy the most expensive dish).  For wine, figure out what you would like to order as your meal, then ask Flora for a recommendation - again, you will receive an honest, thought-out recommendation, a perfect wine to compliment your meal, and it is usually more reasonably priced than the wine you had picked out.  The restaurant is beautiful, charming, and intimate and has the perfect ambiance.  \n\nTip:  make a reservation, always - even if you believe it is not a busy night.  It is a courtesy.  Flora and her staff really prefer that and it is understandable, as they are a very small restaurant who plan the menu out every day.  For the folks that are saying, \"You can't get a table\" and \"They hate tourists,\" that is so untrue.

Da Flora appeared to be a cozy and relaxing restaurant so we figured we'd give it a try. Compared to many of the other restaurants along the way, Flora's is very quiet, and in fact you can even have a conversation without losing your voice (good luck with this at many other North Beach eateries). The waitress was kind enough to seat us immediately, even though we did not have a reservation. The menu was a bit hard to decipher, as it was hand written in not the easiest to understand script. However, the sweet potato gnocchi with parmesean and sage stood out as something I absolutely must try, since it has been years since my old Swiss Italian friend spent a half a day mass producing these heavenly sweet and savory dumplings back when I was a poor graduate student and couldn't afford to eat more than ramen noodles. I also ordered the salad of the day- watercress with cherries, sweet and creamy gorgonzola, and almonds and an accompanying drink of prosecco. While we waited for our food, we snacked on the foccacia- rather plain tasting- but probably authentic Italian (I remember in Italy, the bread was bland). Once the gnocchi arrived I was in complete heaven- these drops of bliss were served with a light and creamy sauce, and garnished with fried sage. Ordinarily the dish would come with bacon, but since I am not a bacon fan, opted to omit this component. While the portion was appetizer size, I am glad that I did not scale up the portion, as our waitress had suggested, as the dumplings were very rich and satisfying. The salad was a great compliment, and the prosecco made the entire experience bubbly and magical.", "author": "Kate A."}

This one definitely made it into our list-- the never-go-again list. Worst attidute, worst (outright bad) wine, and just so-so food. We complained about the wine, and the response: the lady just walks away! Not a word. They never once asked how the food was. Like another reviewer, we also felt like others were treated better--probably the regulars. What I don't understand is, how can someone be a regular in this place? I've done my share of restaurants in life, and believe me, I can tell a good one when I see one. If you want good Italian food, stay away from here.", "author": "ofelia R."}

Great wine list and incredible \"custom-designed and hand-made\" Northern Italian food. The service is very personnel and also helpful with selections and recommendations. Make sure that you try the gnocchi! We had a very relaxing and enjoyable time and will go back, for sure.", "author": "William W."}

We'd never heard of the place but we toasted our good fortune - every course was delicious, including the wine.  Then, sadly, we made reservations and treated some friends on a Friday night.  It's was crowded and maybe a little understaffed and overbooked.  Food arrived lukewarm and some dishes were just - eh. The waiter was nice but kept forgetting to bring water etc.  Finally, one of us had to leave the table and chase the waiter down.   anyway - every restaurant can have a bad night on occasion.  we still love this place and we'll still recommend it....but perhaps not on a Friday or Saturday night.", "author": "aidan f."}

From the minute we walked in the door (on time and with a reservation) we were treated like second class citizens. Flora (nicknamed the sea witch) was grungy, unkept and rude. She asked us to wait outside while she waited for a chair to open up because she had run out. When we asked for the rigatoni, she informed us that they were out out and had replaced it with a delicious ravioli. When I asked her how many raviolis come with the dish she told me she didn't have time to find out. They served us the wrong wine, the food was totally bland, they never came by the table. Flora seemed only interested in the regulars. (Regulars? who would put up with this treatment and poor quality more than once?) Do yourself a favor and skip this hell hole.", "author": "Steven F."}

A friend recommended it as her favorite Italian restaurant in the city, and I see that many Yelpers agree. My husband and I went on a Wednesday around 6 p.m. When we entered, there were 2 other parties there, but by the time we left the place was packed. Even with only 2 other parties, service was very slow. Water and bread took a very long time to come. The entrees came very quickly after our orders were taken. I thought their foccacia bread was excellent - maybe the best I've ever tasted. Their homemade tagliatelli, however, was a different story. It was very, very soft - I think they overcooked it by a few minutes because it was soggy. The flavor was mild. My husband got the penne, which was much better, but it was not unique in any way. The bill for the two of us, with no drink, no appetizers, and a shared dessert, was over $50. The food was absolutely not worth that.", "author": "Rogue R."}
