We ordered about $20 worth or 12 pieces including a small fried rice.\n\nDifferent textures, different tastes but the same disappointment and dissatisfaction throughout. \n\nMost of the dim sum was cold and I just chewed on the meat (pork, I think) until I worked up the courage to swallow.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-10-14", "description": "We should have taken a hint when this place was quiet during the lunch rush. In any case, we took our chances mostly because we were too lazy to wait in line elsewhere, and we paid for it. I don't even have dim sum that often and I could tell that the food didn't quite taste right. House of Dim Sum fell short in almost every possible way. The flavors were bland, the textures were all wrong, and weird substitute ingredients were often used for traditional dishes. \n\nThe sticky rice I ordered was complete mush but was stiff and hard at the same time. I don't know how they did it either. Actually I do. The odd texture pretty much gave it away: the rice was obviously stale and cooked either the day before (or even earlier) and reheated. The lazy college student version of me has definitely done this before and I'm not proud of it. The egg yolk inside was also uncharacteristically crumbly and synthetically bright which scared me a little. Definitely decided not to finish my meal out of fear. \n\nI think the topper to all of this disappointment was that the prices did not appropriately reflect the quality. If this place had been dirt cheap, we would have expected the quality of food we received. However, the prices were hardly a bargain and I'm sure there are a multitude of cheaper, better-tasting, good quality dim sum places within just a few blocks. \n\nSteer clear of this place if you ever find yourself wandering Chinatown, even if you feel like you're in a bind to find a cheap/quick lunch at the last minute. Definitely felt a little ripped off as we left this place since it all came together once we noticed that House of Dim Sum's main customer base seems to be made up of tourists who don't know any better as well. In retrospect, it makes sense that tourists are attracted to this little place that has no line and provides seating. It's perfect for those who need to save time in order to see all the sights but also take a moment to sit and rest their feet from all the walking through the hills of SF.", "author": "Junes S."}

Unfortunately, when we got to Chinatown we realized none of these places have seating areas!  Given the weather, we had to settle for this place because it has a dining area.  Well, the ratings were accurate- the food really wasn't that good.  Many of the items were served cold, including the pork buns they took out of the steam tray! It was also strange that my food items were served to me on a thin paper plate, because I didn't have a place to pour soy sauce into for dipping!!

There is limited space for seating inside and I wanted to just get our food to-go and eat elsewhere but my family wanted to sit down so some of us went upstairs to get a table. The only table big enough to seat all of us was taken by a group of people in the corner who weren't even eating. They were just sitting there talking. We ended up sitting at two separate tables. \n\nI'm assuming that the customers are suppose to be responsible and clean up after themselves because none of the employees ever went upstairs and it was filthy. Most of the tables weren't even cleaned off. Several tables had leftover food and trays on them and there was only one small garbage can in the corner. Since practically all the food was greasy, it soaked through the paper plates and left a pool of grease on the tables. But the mess doesn't bother some people. This old man sat down and just pushed the mess aside and ate his food. \n\nMy aunt was getting frustrated because the lady behind the counter was helping four people at once and didn't even seem to care who got what food. When my aunt tried asking how much the food cost, these little old Chinese women came in and practically pushed her out of the way and started ordering their food. I've seen this kind of behavior in a lot of other places. If you're in the way, they'll move you. If they want something, they'll go for it regardless of who else was there before them. They don't consider themselves rude because in some cultures that's how things are done. I'm used to it but I can see how others would get irritated really fast.\n\nThe food was just ok. They didn't serve anything that you couldn't find at the next half dozen dim sum places down the street.

That is especially bad for the \"steamed\" pork buns.\n\nThe Jasmine tea was a little good, but the experience wasn't very good.  When I arrived there, I had to use the restroom which I ran in to use prior to purchasing my food.  Because someone spent 3 minutes in the restroom, I waited impatiently.  During that time, the rude woman who worked here gave my friend an attitude implying that we were wasting her time just so that I could use the restroom and leave without paying for anything.\n\nThat only made their rating go from a two star place to a one star place which breaks down as follows:\n\n1.  Cold Dim Sum\n2.  Dirty inside\n3.  and a staff with attitude.\n\nAs they say in baseball: three strikes and you're out!\n\nDon't waste your time here when there is better Dim Sum in a very competitive SF Chinatown.

Oh well, we are starving and have made the long trek up and down the hill.  Let's order a few more things.  Alright, those aren't in the microwave.  We get our food, sit down, and we each eat a shrimp dumpling, which is bleh.  Then on to the shumai.  Ummmm, seriously?  The three of us are fighting gag reflexes.  We had a few plates with different dumplings on it...what a waste.  All lukewarm at best.  One minute in the microwave did nothing.  The food must have been room temperature or colder.  We ask for a to-go box and the ladies look at us funny.  I wanted to tell them that the food was horrible, but I knew it would fall on deaf ears.  I had seen the two cooks come out to hand over the cooked food to the ladies, and they looked uninspired and all around gloomy.  Definitely a reflection of their food.  We left and wanted to give the food to a homeless person, but we felt that they wouldn't even eat it.  They probably know where to find the good food!  We were fighting gag reflexes for half an hour...\n\nTo sum: horrible.  They must have just discovered the microwave...at an antique store.  Besides, any time you need a microwave, you are cooking too much food ahead of time.  You shouldn't even be serving food.  Their steamer did not keep anything warm.  Chinese food needs a make over here in the US.  I am embarassed for these Chinese restaurants.  I'm more sad that people have to grow up thinking this food is really what it is supposed to be like.\n\nAbout me: I am spoiled by being within driving distance to Vancouver, BC.  Anywhere you go: you order, they make, they serve.  FRESH. No carts, no microwaves.", "author": "Dereck G."}

Fresh, tasty dim sum, super-low prices and bustling counter service give this ghetto place a unique energetic vibe (at least at mealtimes). No plates here; it's only plastic bags and trays.

I bought a large order of jook (porridge), lor mai guen (sticky rice wrapped in bread), ja leurng (chinese fried donut wrapped in white noodle), siu lung bow (steamed pork dumplings), and gow choy gau (chive filled dumplings).  I must say the jook was really good.  It was better then any dim sum places I've been to.  The siu lung bow was okay, as well as the gow choy gau.  The ja leurng isn't all that bad.  This is one the only places that I know of (that is dim sum shops) that have ja leurng.  With regards to decor, it's not the most cleanliness of places, but it's not the dirtiest either.  I must admit the best tasting item was the jook.  I do intend to return to this place.", "author": "Philip L."}

Oh man, I wanted to try something different than my usual run to Good Mong Kok and boy, what a mistake. I ordered a few shrimp dumplings, chive dumplings, and another item that looks like rice noodle with beef or pork inside. First of all, I was charged $7!!! That is outlandish for a hole-in-the-wall place in Chinatown. The food was awful, even if it costs $1. Really oily and they microwave the food before they serve it to you. This made the dumpling skin really chewy and hard. The lady taking order is nice and understands English but that can't make up for the bad food. You'll be better off going to one of the other excellent dim sum places in Chinatown.", "author": "Khoi N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-05", "description": "I have to strongly disagree with my fellow yelpers. Many do not understand that chinese fast food places are different from burger king and mac donalds. They steam the buns and dim sum in large quantities in the kitchen. Afterwards they place them in a steamer that is under the counter. Therefore, the dim sum is always warm and fresh. They give you an option of microwaving your food if you prefer it to be warmer or not. Either way, the dim sum is still delicious.\n\nAlso, many do not realize that the prices here are nearly half the price that you normally purchase dim sum for. One order of dim sum is only $1.50. There's not too many places where you could get it at this price. So all you tourists and inexperienced people out there, don't criticize this place if you do not truly have the real experience of chinese dining.", "author": "Kelvin C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-03-21", "description": "I work in SOMA, my friend, the conch, works in the financial district and I desperately needed to buy a kite.\n\nFound the one I wanted at a kite shop in Chinatown.  Perfect, I told the conch I would swing by her way and we could go on a little Chinatown adventure. Kites, those cool red and gold shoes, most likely made by children in sweatshops, dim sum and tourists.\n\nI ended up being dragged to Macy's to buy women's underthings.  I still think she should have purchased the pink ones.   And maybe there wasn't actual dragging.\n\nThe kite shop had just what I was looking for and more.  Chinatown Kite Shop.\n\nThen we decided to check Yelp to find a decent Dim Sum place.  As we were both on our phones, we did a quick lookup and saw several places on Jackson had 4 stars, so headed that direction.\n\nHouse of Dim Sum had 4 stars and the food in the window looked decent.  Of course, now that I'm back in my office, House of Dim Sum now has 3 stars.  Perhaps someone had the same afternoon the conch and I did.\n\nWe stopped in, ordered a few dumplings, rice noodles, steamed and pastry items.  We both went for the dumplings first.  Not bad, probably the only thing I would order here again if I had to go back.  The wrapping was a bit too thick, but that seemed to be a general theme of the dim sum here.  The shrimp and chive dumpling had a piece of shrimp...as in a portion of a whole shrimp.  The conch thought it was the spinach dumpling I had ordered, until I directed her to what on the plate was the actual spinach dumpling.\n\nSame problem with the rice noodles.  The noodle was too thick, a little gummy, and contained one shrimp, although, I think this was one whole shrimp.  And none of that cool sauce I like to get at a sit down place.   Although this has seating, it is definitely not a sit down place.\n\nThe steamed pork buns held a decently flavored filling, but it was like sifting through a mouthful of cotton balls to find it.\n\nIf I were VERY, VERY hungover, it might be just the kind of carb laden meal I was looking for.\n\nAfter the pork buns, well, I can't really tell you what came next.  Neither of us remember ordering this large steamed item; but there it was, on our plastic tray, looking strikingly like a mini Frisbee disk.  Hmmm, the conch tried it first,  and told me not to bother.  But bother, I did.  And was rewarded for my efforts.  She had only discovered the hard boiled egg hidden inside, but I was the lucky one to happen upon the piece of congealed sausage tucked inbetween said egg and a chicken like substance.  The wind blew through the open door at this point blowing my napkins over the top of our flying discus, and we both agreed we were happy we didn't know what it was, as we would not order the mystery item again.\n\nAnd then we moved on to the pastry.  The dough was flaky, but a bit undercooked.  The flavors reminded us of that good dim sum you can get.  If only these pastries weren't cold, had even a touch of heat to push it over the edge from doughy to flaky perfection.  If only.  It was like eating a cold Pop-Tart.  And I'll admit, those are edible, but toasted...wow, you just can't recover from a memory like that.  So close on this one, House of Dim Sum, so close.  But this isn't horseshoes, or grenades.\n\nOr maybe it is.  Because the first thing the conch and I noticed as we left the restaurant was a leaden tightness in our stomaches.  Much as I would expect to feel upon swallowing a horseshoe, or being kicked with one.\n\nI was torn between one and two stars on this one.  I'll give this place 2, as the food wasn't greasy, the dumplings were edible and hey, I had a lot of fun and left with the promise of going out w/ the conch again to find another, better dim sum place.", "author": "g m."}

I liked this place because you save soooo much money when you don't sit down and have the ladies push their carts around, bringing the dim sum to you.  Sure, that's a nice experience, but this trip's goal was to score cheap dim sum in an aunthentic 'hole in the wall' type place, as the previous reviewer says... however, I didn't mind House of Dim Sum's atmosphere at all... we just pointed out what we wanted downstairs to the nice ladies behind the counter, carried it all upstairs on our trays, and chowed down, all for only about $7 a person, including a couple of drinks and leftovers at the end to take home.

After wandering up the hill I was excited to see shrimp dumplings, lotus leaf wrapped sticky rice with chicken, turnip cake, and pork dumplings. Upon getting back to the office I hungrily devoured the shrimp dumplings, which were only ok. It might have been that I was hungry, but they seemed pretty tasty. Moving on the turnip cake. It was a cold gelatinous square. Aside from being the wrong temperature it had too much pepper and not enough chopped up bits of goodness. If you are a turnip cake eater - you know what I mean. The potstickers were greasy and the wrapper was too thick. Ugh. Disappointing.  Finally I get around to the wrapped chicken, which was ok - decent, but doesn't merit a return trip. All in all I spent $5.50, but I don't feel like I got a deal. I'm full but far from satisfied.
