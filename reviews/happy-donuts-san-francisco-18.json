Here are the facts: it's open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It's got all the classic, doughy, no-fuss pastries you crave. It's right on the J line and near the 48. It's cash-only because it's cheap, and it would be ridiculous for you to buy enough to make using a card worth it-- but you can, if you want. You can. At 3 in the morning. And you'll love it.\n\nI think this may be one of the last remaining true 24/7 donut joints in SF, in fact. Donut World in the Sunset now closes for at least 2 hours at about 4 in the morning, I think, but Happy Donut is here for you, and it couldn't be in a nicer part of town, still in a central part of Noe Valley just away from the very busiest part. That's the way I like it.", "author": "AJ P."}

THANK U YELP. Ordered some breakfast sandwiches, because the heavenly combination of bread, cheese, eggs, and meat always gets me pumped for the day. And the girl literally pulls out a pan and scrambles the eggs, heated up the sausage and bacon, and added the cheese to a toasted croissant. TALK ABOUT SERVICE, MA DAMN.\n\nSo, needless to say, my friends and I have agreed that this will now be the spot we hit up the morning after a wild night.

So bagels, donuts, sandwiches, danish, croissants and drinks. \n\nHighlight for me was the bacon egg cheese croissant that I had is prepared fresh so the egg will be actually made to order and you taste it!\nYummy. Skip the coffee (they are selling such a lot of coffee and refill often still ha this caramel coffee taste when it's to long on a warming plate) good that they also serve espressos and lattes so you get a really fresh coffee of you order that. \n\nThe shop has four generous tables so it is okay to have a cupa here and enjoy watching people. \n\nSo why one star he place is very clean what you would not expect for a hole in a wall donut shop but they taking good care. The whole time I was having my croissant the Guys are baking and frying and working. \n\nSo why \"only\" four stars? Well service is \"limited\" what means they lack a bit of friendliness and are a bit rough. But hey again it is 2am in the morning (well now it's almost 3am, what's better then a sandwich and a coffee and watching people take a chance do it here) \n\nMaybe they earn that star someday when I am showing up at 4pm :-).\n\n** important information even in the age of people paying with their phone and square this a place fighting for your coins.

But if you've ever tried Bob's donut out in polk st. I feel like they dip their bars a couple more times so you can really taste the maple on top. But this donut here, is soft, fresh, and pretty light in that you won't be dying of thirst after you eat it. The croissants are pretty pricey, anywhere from 6-7 dollars.

A coworker of mine recommended Happy Donuts since they are open 24 hours. \n\nWhen I arrived I was immediately disappointed in the selection of donuts that were available. There were only apple fritters, plain glazed and cake donuts with white frosting. It was 1:00am on a Tuesday which typically isn't a busy day or time for any business so, for a 24 hour donut shop I definitely expected to have many more options. Like REALLY?! No donut holes?! Unbelievable!\n\nI decided to order two of each that were available. Six donuts = $7.00 and change--not bad, especially since apple fritters are usually more than $2.00 each.\n\nThe man who was working was less than pleasant. No \"hello,\" \"what can I get for you,\" \"thank you,\" or even a hint of a smile. Clearly customer service isn't a priority at this place. Some may overlook the lack of customer service, but for me, I like to feel appreciated when I'm spending my hard earned money (YES, even if it's for a $1.25 donut)\n\nThe donuts were pretty good, especially for what they cost but the poor selection and lack of customer service were quite off putting.\n\nI suppose it's a good place if you have a late night craving for anything sweet, but frankly, if it can wait there are better options in SF.", "author": "Andreea M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-04-18", "description": "The donuts are ok but the people that run this place are A**holes.\n\nI've had two bad experiences with this place.\n\nFirst time I went there around 2am and asked for a jelly donut. On my way out I bit into the donut and there was something wrong. There was no sugar in it so it tasted like a piroshki with jelly.\n\nI went back in and asked for a replacement donut. The guy running the place refused suggesting that I was trying to scam them (this seemed like a lot of work just for one  free bite of donut). Then he insisted that it was impossible that there was a problem with the donut. Since I had only taken one bite I suggested he try the donut. He refused, saying that there was no need since nothing could be wrong with the donut. I insisted, saying we could easily resolve this impasse if he would just taste the donut himself. Again he refused saying that I was trying to scam them. \n\nThis went on for a little while but finally the tide turned. First, I was really annoyed so I decided just to throw out the donut and leave. However, the only garbage can I could see was behind the counter. I thought that if I threw it hard enough it would go straight in. This turned out to be wishful thinking and instead the donut hit the white wall about 5 feet above the garbage can. If nothing else, this confirmed that the donut was, indeed, full of jelly.\n\nAround the same time, a number of customers started chanting: \"give the man his jelly donut, give the man his jelly donut.\" Even then the donut guy refused to give me a replacement donut. Finally, a particularly large man who had clearly spent his evening in a bar got to his feet, pointed at the donut guy and shouted \"GIVE HIM HIS JELLY DONUT!!\"\n\nThis finally worked but it turned out that there were no more jelly donuts. The whole store started booing so, to defuse the situation, I accepted another, inferior type of donut. The store went quiet as everyone waited to see if this one was OK. I took a bite and confirmed that it was indeed a real donut and everyone applauded and I left.\n\nThe second experience was not as dramatic but still pissed me off. I went with my 6-year old son and we each got a donut. I paid but she didn't give me my change. Since it was only 15 cents it wasn't a big deal. However my son was very thirsty so I told him to ask for a glass of water. The woman running the store refused. I got up to ask as well and she said that there were no cups. When I pointed at the big stack of paper cups, she said that they could only be used for coffee. I thought it was rude not to give us water so I decided to ask for my 15 cent change. I told her I wanted it and went to the register. However, she made no move to give me the money. I waited and waited for her to come. After about 5-10 minutes I managed to get the attention of the other person working there (her son?). He explained, very rudely, that I had misunderstood the price. Fair enough but why did I have to wait for 5-10 minutes and then get insulted just to be told that?\n\nAnyway, please do not go to this place. If you happen to live east of there I strongly recommend the donut shop on 24th about 2 blocks past Mission St. called the \"Jelly Donut\". The donuts are great and the people that work there are very nice.", "author": "John S."}

Walking to the gym and walking back, I am lured by the smell of donuts that encapsulate the corner of 24th and Church.  The only way to resist is to purposely walk out of my apartment without any money because even a measly dollar can get you SOMETHING sweet here, which is awesome if you're cheap and/or unemployed but horrible if you need to lose several pounds.  The lure of doughnuts after working out is agonizing as my brain frantically rationalizes that one little doughnut hole can't hurt.  But who can eat just one doughnut hole?  Let's get real -- I can eat a dozen doughnut holes before I reach the end of the effing block.\n\nTheir food and coffee aren't the greatest, but definitely satisfying and worth what you pay for.  Living in Noe Valley for the past 13 years or so, I've come to rely on it more than once as a place to get a bite late at night after the bars close.  When the boyfriend can't be bothered to make breakfast himself or wait for me to wake up, he'll run down here to get us coffee and breakfast sandwiches that are way cheaper than the other options nearby such as La Boulange.  Tables are plentiful and service is fine.  The big windows that face the street give the place a very open feel which encourages folks to stay and linger.", "author": "Courtney Y."}

That motherf*****.  He's no man. That douche!\"\n\nI adore my Bahstonian friends, can you see that?  \n\nHappy Donuts was silently jeering at our situation, but perhaps when a relationship ends and there are truly no strings to tuck back into places invoking normalcy, the appearance of sweet puffy pastries and hot coffee steaming on the counters was all silenced persons such as ourselves could look to for encouragement.\n\nI had a large coffee.  Lots of cream.  Lots of sugar.  I made note of the 75 cents for a refill.\n\nHe had a small coffee and a large cinnamon roll. Cash only.  Good thing, had only $5 on him.\n\nHe offered a piece of the brown glazed bready snail to me. \n\nZoom went a little arrow through my head.  I viewed the piece of donut hanging from his fingers, fishbowl view.  You see, I have been working out like crazy, most likely to transition the stresses of my dead car and the dead relationship off my shoulders and mind.  The good thing, is that doing cardio at a vicious pace saves me from insanity.  In addition, I'm losing weight and packing my butt up, a rare feat for this Japanese lady.\n\n\"No thanks,\" I refuse and continue to look out to the window.  IT's chatter becomes more of interference sound, the undramatic zzzzzz on a black and white screen.\n\nIt was late, probably around 10:30 pm.  The man behind the counter was busy running doing his chores, cleaning and prepping, probably wondering who-the-hell was the sobbing idiot sitting near the windows.  An older gentleman sitting behind Walter kept on throwing me sympathetic glances during my bouts of talking and babbling.  Men walking on the sidewalk sent me furtive glances; reassuring ones at the very least.\n\nThe world seems to have taken pity on me lately.  Am I wearing the scarlet \"R\" for yet another relationship dead on my chest?\n\nSipping good smooth coffee and watching people stream by like ghosts on Muni made me feel a little better.  Perhaps this moment was just a rift in the apparition of what our relationship had become: dead.  It was terrible knowing that he would no longer be a part of my life, however the situation was made slightly sweeter with the knowledge that the large and strong display of sugared bread twists, glazed bear claws and pink frosted donuts had my back.

My second visit here, I was hoping to give Happy Donuts another chance to impress me, and impress me it did. I got an apple fritter and a braided donut, and both were pretty amazing. The apple fritter was huge, simultaneously crispy and fluffy, and had an almost candy-like glazed top (I found it to be a little too sweet alone, but a small piece of the fritter accompanied by coffee was just right).

St and at the end of every week, I would reward myself with deep fried dough covered in a sugary glaze. I got pretty intimate with the chocolate old fashioned (no not THAT intimate! Just some heavy petting and LOTS of tongue) and the cinnamon rolls but you really can't go wrong here. \n\nAlso, if you're ever in need of police assistance there's a pretty good chance you can find a cop here. I've seen up to three squad cars parked outside. I thought the place had been robbed. C'mon guys, do you really need to perpetuate the stereotype? How about treating yourself to some nice brioche every once in a while?\n\nWell, there's not a whole lot of donuts being eaten these days as part of my \"New Me in 2007\"(TM megan w.) plan so instead I'll just have to send you fucking slobs over to Happy Donuts so that I can enjoy their glazed deliciousness vicariously...just let me smell your breath afterwards.", "author": "Josua P."}

Soon thereafter, San Francisco's  level of energy drops from mildly-boisterous to barely-tepid as a uniform blanket of eerie silence slowly envelops it's sidewalks.  Still, it's streets elicit an ever-so-faint heartbeat... one that's formed by a scant few souls that remain out-and-about after the stroke of two, and fueled by a dwindling collection of businesses who cater to them....\n\nHappy Donut is barely visible during the hustle and bustle of Noe Valley's daytime scene, but it's neon lighting and unlocked door stick out in oasis-like fashion come the stroke of midnight.  Walking amidst the tomb-like silence of 24th Street during the wee hours of the morn, it's brightly lit windows and visibly inviting pastry counter forms a lighthouse-like beacon that calls out to insomniacs, tweakers, and burners-of-midnight-oil.\n\nBig windows facing both 24th and Church Streets give Happy Donuts a nice view as night yields to dawn, and dawn gives way to daybreak. No matter when you arrive, there's always at least one other night-urchin camped out at a table.  The staff....even the graveyard shift, are kindly and polite, and seem to view late-night customers as a welcome break from the drudgery of cooking donuts.  The layout is definitely geared more towards eat-and-run rather than sip-and-linger, but linger I have....and the staff never seems to mind in the slightest.  The pastry selection is on par with the average donut shop, though a cheesecake-like item they prepare in sheets and serve in squares is nothing short of stellar.  I always get a turkey sandwich on a French roll.  It's quality is on par with that of the average daytime deli, but relatively exceptional when compared to anything else that's available between two and six AM.\n  \nHappy Donuts represents an island of simple pleasures in a surrounding bog of gentrification run amok.  It's an oasis of affordable indulgences mired amongst a nauseating array of chic boutiques and spendy bistros.  And come two in the morn, it's glowing windows elicit a subtle welcome from within the dark mass or Noe Valley's shuttered storefronts:\n\nGive me your wired, your hungry,\nYour restless souls yearning for something to eat.\nThe wretched refuse of night-life play.\nSend these, the sleepless, lonely souls to me.\nMy neon glow beckons 24 hours a day!", "author": "Mike W."}

The donut holes are usually well frosted and fresh, the chocolate cinnamon twists are divine, and the regular varieties of glazed and cake donuts provide a lighter breakfast when the twist is too daunting.\nI have never tried the coffee or other drinks, but these appear to be popular with other regulars.  Very friendly staff, too.", "author": "John C."}

It's a comfortably clean place and the lady who I usually ordered from was always *really* nice, which to me is reason enough for 5 STARS.\n\nBAM!\n\nOh, and here's a little vid to get you donut lovers in the mood.\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=wEZHGe2S9vc", "author": "Natalie D."}
