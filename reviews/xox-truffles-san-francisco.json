Chef Jean Marc started this business as a side business after suffering from a heart attack from his corporate America job and this became his full time gig. You can tell by each carefully crafted truffle this is his passion. \nThe flavors are on point and if you order a coffee you can get a free truffle. You won't get this at Starbucks =/ \n\nAlcoholics unite! They had alcohol infused truffles so chocolate and alcohol... it just doesn't get better than this.  I had the cognac which had just a slight bit of cognac flavor. You'll need to eat a few of these to get any kind of buzz but do I hear challenge?!? challenge accepted \n\nThe location is small so you may miss it but it's definitely worth the visit in North Beach.", "author": "Lindsay C."}

That might be your greatest mistake EVER!\n\nI used to love only milk chocolate, and didn't care much for dark chocolate until my S.O. introduced me to this place. \n\nOMG! OMG! OMG! \n\nIf you're a fine (red) wine drinker, you can relate to this analogy: Remember when you only drank nice semi-sweet to sweet white wines but couldn't stand the taste of the harsher red wines? And then someone introduced you to a wonderful red (Cabernet or Bordeaux) @ a meal, and you experienced that Ah-Ha moment? XOX truffles is kinda like that!\n\nThe proprietor is a large curly-haired bear of a man, who is also a very gentle & proud (and rightly so) Frenchman. He smiles broadly but is a little bit modest in his product. His hard work at his craft is reflected in the big flavor-packed deliciousness of these wonderful little truffles. \n\nI have purchased large quantities for both the S.O. and I over the past 7 years, and have yet to tire of their wonderfully rich intense chocolaty flavor. \n\nForget those fancy packages, unless you are hunting for gifts or are a tourist. Those white take out/To-Go boxes he offers are the real deal. \n\nThe more you buy, the cheaper they are. 40 truffles are not too many for one person. Refrigerated, you can steal a sweet & tasty morsel (or two, or four) of sinfully deliciousness anytime of night or day for the next 2-3 weeks!  How good is THAT?\n\nIf you even just 'like' chocolate, or even just 'think' you like chocolate, you haven't tried something as wonderful in your mouth as these. \n\nDo yourself a favor: Treat Yourself, Don't Cheat Yourself!\n\nEnuf Sed!", "author": "william s."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-10-21", "description": "We came here after reading all of the great reviews on Yelp to try some truffles. There are so many different flavors, and many are very unique. Cognac, mango, raspberry, kahlua, amaretto, hazelnut, Earl Grey, matcha, milk, dark chocolate, caramel... just to name a few. You can buy truffles individually for $1 a piece, get a free truffle if you buy a coffee, or buy 20 or 40 of them at a time. We decided to get 40 for $26. You can pick any combination of flavors, so we ended up getting about 6 different flavors. The owner was nice enough to give us each a truffle of our choice to taste as well.\n\nThe truffles are delicious. They are so delicately made and melt in your mouth. The individual flavors are also quite distinct without being overpowering. I really enjoyed the hazelnut truffle, which was rolled in crushed hazelnuts and tasted heavenly. I also like that each truffle is small enough that you don't feel too guilty about eating a couple of them. \n\nAll of the truffles are mixed together in a box and it is hard to tell which one is which from just looking at them - so every bite is somewhat of a surprise!", "author": "Amy C."}

San Francisco is massively pedestrian/ bike friendly with tons of public transportation options and well, like a lot of things in the city, you are best served by getting here in some way that does not involve driving.\n\nWhile the storefront is unassuming, the chocolate truffles they put out are fantastic. The truffles are believe it or not handmade. There are dozens of different varieties including chili truffles along with all the standard choices (the champagne and vodka truffles are popular), and while mostly they sell by the piece, for bulk orders they can make some wholesale style deals. They have a focus on presentation as well, and will ship pretty much anywhere, but do note that shipping chocolate to west texas in July may not have the best results. \n\nIn store they have room at the window counter for maybe six folks if they are friendly and everyone's taken a shower but for the most part this is a retail take it home style location. Having said that, they do have an in store deal wherein if you buy a couple of truffles, you'll get a free cup of coffee. The coffee is just a plain brewed cup, but it's dang near perfect with a truffle or three. They do an unremarkable hot chocolate as well. Make no mistake however the focus here is all on the super awesome chocolate product they put out. \n\nPricing isn't any too bad. I mean yeah sure it's easy to go crazy in here with all the great truffle choices, but it's the most economical stop on Columbus for coffee, and it's entirely possible to get close to a dozen truffles for ten bucks or so. \n\nIf you are out and about like (love) chocolate, need a tasteful (and tasty) gift or just want to treat yourself a bit this is a must have.", "author": "Steven W."}

We were walking down Columbus Avenue, after we picked up cannolis, fortune cookies, and a box full of dim sum. We paused and saw the XOX Truffle sign and thought it looked like an interesting shop to check out. It was the best idea ever! We were going to look and maybe pick up a few truffles, but then I saw the hot chocolate sign with all the different flavors and we couldn't resist. We got the hot white, regular, and milk chocolate drinks. All three were so good. The white was sweeter than the other two and super rich, but delicious. The regular hot chocolate kind of had a dark chocolate taste, but that could be from drinking the other two drinks, the milk chocolate and white chocolate. There was two or three people in front of us, but that was okay. The owner said they would be with us soon. A new employee made our three chocolate drinks with the owner checking on him. They all turned out so delicious. All three had distinct flavors. This was the best hot chocolate we have ever had and we have been on a quest for the best hot chocolate for years. The temperature and the consistency was perfect. We also got a free truffle with each drink. We chose lemon, peanut butter, and dark chocolate. All delicious!", "author": "Julie W."}

I love dark chocolate and the little drops of dark chocolate here are heaven. The bitterness and how smooth the chocolate is just melts and swirls in your mouth. They also have different specialty flavors like Kahlua and cognac, but I opted out for earl grey and I gotta tell you it is worth every penny. The shop is small and easy to miss. There's not much seating so it's more of a grab and go type place. \n\nThis place is simply superb and I would definitely choose this chocolate shop over Godiva or Ghirardelli any day.

Each piece is small enough to be \"healthy\" but just enough to give you a brief sensation of heaven. Lots of dark dark chocolate options, as well as some not as much for those who prefer it that way. Chef Jean-Marc was amazingly friendly and passionate about his chocolates. You can feel his love and dedication to the art in each piece of chocolate. \n\nSmall storefront, but enough room for a few people both inside and outside. There's also some coffee/espresso options to pair with your delicious chocolates. My favorite was the lavender truffle, but there were so many flavors to choose from, it was really hard to decide which to get (solution: try them all!!) He even has matcha truffles! Unless it's a fresh batch, consider letting the truffle warm back up to room temperature from refrigeration. The taste and texture are completely different that way.\n\nOverall, I say XOX Truffles is a must-try if you're in this area and like chocolate. Pricing is appropriate for the quality you get, but it isn't cheap, so be prepared. The store is small and easy to miss, but once you're inside, you won't want to leave!

Shifts the ground beneath you a little. Gives you a new viewpoint. I'm not saying that's guaranteed to happen here, I can only tell you my experience.\n\nIf ever there's a lesson in how we should cherish the little things, it's best exemplified at XOX Truffles. So much beauty, so much passion, so much flavor; and it's all wrapped up inside a small but beautiful package. Truffles are so small. That's an easy observation to make. But use all of your senses and you realize how they are pure magic all around: they smell intoxicating and the minute you're in the shop you'll be taken away to a new place where your heart just beats a little differently. Listen to the artisans who make them, if you're lucky enough to arrive during production. The methodical care they take, and how the warmth almost sings to you. Be careful to touch them--though they have that think layer of cocoa dust on the outside to protect them, know that they'll melt. It's that delicate precipice that makes holding them alluring but also dangerous. And yes, taste them. Taste all of them. Every flavor. \n\nThey are so small, but so much is wrapped up in them. I've been thinking about this concept a lot lately: that seeing the world through someone else's eyes can make it new, beautiful, magical, and wonderful again. Truffles are an art, and here we get to see a portrait of the world through the eyes of the artist truffle-maker. The soft milky chocolate, the sharp and unexpectedly poignant cognac truffle, and the bright and happy orange. Each of them is an expression of the artist's experience, their mood, their perceptions; seeing them through the eyes of the visionary is a view of a world filled with flavor.\n\nThink too, about watching someone else enjoy the unique flavors. Think about experiencing it through their eyes. I've been thinking about this concept, too -- the parents who take their kids to Disneyland for the first time and re-discover the happiness around them. Buy a bunch of truffles and give them to someone, then watch them enjoy each flavor. Listen to them describe the subtleties and nuances of each one. There is no more delicious way to realize that we are all unique, precious, wonderful creatures with diverse ideas and viewpoints, than to gift a box of these truffles and just sit back to watch and listen.\n\nVisit the store and you'll also learn important life lessons about judging the book by its cover. Located right on Columbus, you could blink and miss it. The shop is tiny, the signs hand painted, the dishes mismatched, and the appearance belies the absolute perfection of an art that happens on the inside. I actually think the exterior is perfect just how it is. It has character, it's authentic, it has a style all its own. But there is a certain truth to the notion that you've just found something wonderful where you least expected it. Just stop. Get to know what's on the inside. It will surprise and delight you.\n\nAll this comes at a price: expect to pay over $50 a pound. They have pre-packed boxes (adorable Chinese takeout boxes) in various sizes. I grabbed a half pound box which has two of every flavor within. But do it just once, and you'll want to do it over and over again.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

The kind of chocolate that makes your insides melt, at least that's how it feels for me. I'm a bit of a dark chocolate connoisseur. \n\nI first got a box of chocolates from xox truffles when I was about 19 (11 years ago) from a lady I used to dance with. Some of us already started eating the chocolate before our performance and we all agreed it was the best chocolate we've ever had. I remember one girl (I swear it wasn't me) ate almost half her box! It was that good.\n\nI came here recently feeling deprived of dark truffles and I noticed they had some vegan chocolate. I got a small box of some vegan dark chocolate, hazelnut, coconut and espresso. It was all so good. I don't come here often... it's one of those really special places where you can go and treat yourself. The truffles are small and hand made but that's what makes you appreciate it more.

This chocolate shop on Columbus focuses on the classic French truffle, not the modern shiny confection as the owner will tell you. He takes pride in describing how the chocolate truffle should resemble the iconic culinary truffle fungus found in the ground, complete with a dusting of cocoa powder to create the proper \"dirt.\"\n\nThe truffles are hand made and are excellent. He makes many different varieties including liqueur, fruits, and some exotic versions with heat and spice. I had a white chocolate vanilla, cognac, and orange which were all great, but a simple plain chocolate version was just pure indulgence.\n\nI was happy to find this little treasure on the tour and gladly recommend it to any visitor or local looking for a special chocolate treat!", "author": "Kristian D."}

The shop is tiny, and doesn't look very impressive (or you could say it's charming), but it doesn't matter because they taste so very yummy. The truffles are pretty small, and most are covered in a very thin layer of (very well tempered) chocolate. \n\nThe chocolatier making the chocolates (who I believe is also the owner) was there and thanked me several times. The woman who helped pack my box was also friendly.\n\nPrices are pretty high, I think around $50 for a pound. These are meant to be savored, not scarfed down (even though I sometimes ate them that way too), so just buy some and enjoy them slowly, and you wont feel bad about spending that much money on chocolate. I bought a half pound and it was fine, but honestly when I go back I'll get a full pound. And I WILL NOT be sharing with anyone.\n\nThe only thing that would make them better is if there was a way to differentiate the flavors. They almost all look the same, and they are packed into a Chinese take-away box so they're all just mixed up in there. I guess it's kind of fun to be surprised every time you eat one, but I'd rather know which ones I had to choose from.", "author": "Lacey T."}

They have so many different kinds of truffles here that you will be sure to find one that will satisfy your sweet tooth. \n\nIf you're into alcohol, they have a good range of truffles infused with alcohol. Chocolate and wine are a good match, aren't they? For me, I love myself some dark chocolate, earl grey and fruit infused chocolates. The earl grey was phenomenal. If they tell you it's an earl grey truffle, then it's going to give you earl grey. The same is true of the green tea, which is so delightful too! My favorite probably has to be the dark chocolate truffle, but that's because I am a huge dark chocolate fan. Can't say no to rich, bitter chocolate! \n\nThey have so many cute little boxes for you to put your truffles in. These would make fabulous gifts and would make any store bought box of chocolates look sad. They take the time to pack and seal the truffles nicely, as well as pretty up the box. Each truffle is pretty small, but you only need a little bit of that heavenly bite to feel good. \n\nYou get a free sample with your purchase so try away! On hot days in San Francisco, keep your box out of the heat because these truffles will turn into molten otherwise.", "author": "Liz C."}

I never really saw the appeal of truffles; most of the mass-produced ones people offer you are just overwhelming sugar bombs. But these truffles are the real deal. They are subtle and handcrafted and minutely balanced between the sweetness on the inside and the cocoa on the outside. My brother told me that the owner is very proprietary about his recipe, and he probably has to be, because if other people could made truffles like these, they would. \n\nIt's just a bitty little store front with the truffles displayed in a glass case. You can also have real coffee, which my husband assured me was very good. But I wouldn't dilute these truffles.

The quality of the truffles are premium, as soon as you step in the small shop you can see the truffles being prepared by hand. They have a nice variety of truffles. I tried the Vanilla Madagascar and the orange chocolate and both were smooth as silk. The truffles are rich in flavor and before you know you'll wish you had ordered more. As I mentioned earlier, I'm on a quest to find the best Hot Chocolate in the city so I did order one. It was $2 for a small and I was impressed because I've never had anyone whisk hot chocolate ever. The young lady took her time with it, whisking it halfway through and I appreciate it. That makes my experience here even more memorable. Regardless of how good the cup of hot chocolate was, I would rather Come to this place since they put that extra effort into your drink. Needless to say, the hot chocolate was one of the best, I love the fact that the hot chocolate wasn't blazing hot.\n\nEven though I came for Hot Chocolate which was one of the best I've had. I believe the truffles have got to be the reason to come here.

Pretty affordable for truffles, all things considered, although these are smaller which also makes them harder to say no to!  The dark chocolate regular truffle was sublime and I also really liked all of the liquor flavored truffles.  I think my favorites were Kahlua, Cognac (which is the chef's favorite too), and Espresso.\n\nThe most affordable option is to buy the take-out boxes (not super amazing wrapping but you get a pretty good deal).  I think the smallest container was 20 truffles for $14 which is pretty darn cheap.\n\nCame here as a stop on a food tour and I was excited to learn about how truffles are supposed to be made.  Chocolate truffles were named truffles because they are supposed to resemble the fungus truffle which is why they shouldn't be perfectly rounded (like other machine manufactured truffles) and are often dipped in cocoa dust to look like \"dirt\".\n\nI can't wait to come back and try some more.

This practice is perfectly acceptable and thoughtful, except I never received any notification about this, despite having received my account and billing emails correctly. Instead of waiting indefinitely for an email response, the next step should be to call the phone number on my account.\n\nShipping also costs about half of what the truffles cost to begin with, better off buying in store only.\n\nThe cherry on top is after originally posting this review, I received an email with subject line \"Note added to your XOX Truffles order from December 9, 2015.\" The note reads: \"Refunded 1/7/16. Did not pay Express for FL. Bitch!\" If you didn't know this notifies your customer, now you do.

Let me preface by saying I used to work at a fancy chocolate store so I'm kinda picky about chocolate now. I'm also just a chocolate fiend (from birth...apparently according to my mother).\n\nAll the truffles I've tried have been very good. The ones that stick out are the hazelnut and coconut; I found that the flavors in these were more prominent. All the truffles are very smooth and balanced (not too sweet/bitter). The \"price is right\" too with a 20 piece coming in $10 from what I remember. That is a deal fosho. The 2 times I've tried their truffles, they've packaged it in those cute \"to-go\" containers you get from Chinese take-out. (...which speaks to my Chinese self:P)\n\n*The only thing that I wish was different was that their truffles came with a flavor guide or something...or maybe that they looked physically different. so I could know which flavor I was eating.

And before you ask: yes, he is French. The dark chocolate goodness comes out of  a very small (even by SF standards) shop on Columbus Ave, just few blocks down from all the touristy spots. The location is unassuming and too easy to skip if just walking around the neighborhood, unaware of the deliciousness waiting inside.\n\nWe stopped by XOX as part of the aforementioned tour and Chef Jean-Marc was so friendly, funny, and nice that he turned the visit to the highlight of the whole tour. He took his time to show the whole group how he makes his truffles and gave us an overview of his chef career and reasoning behind opening the truffle shop in SF North Beach neighborhood, most known for all things Italian, be it real or fake. \n\nJean-Marc's truffles are bite-sized and hand made by the man himself right in front of you. This is an artisinal, small scale operation at its' finest. After the plain truffles are done, Jean-Marc adds the flavor and toppings. Upon the time of our visit there was about a dozen different flavors to choose from, ranging from hazelnut, raspberry to cognac and vodka. All truffles are pure dark chocolate, so rich and flavorful; a sweet delight that just  melts in your mouth and makes you want more.\n\nThe prices are a bit on the higher end but  totally worth it. Even if you are not the biggest fan of chocolate truffles I guarantee you will become one after the visit to Chef Gorce's shop. No store-bought chocolate can compare.

I don't know how he made it, but the truffle had a delicious soft gooey inside of caramel, and the outside was also very soft, so it was a miracle that the truffle doesn't fall apart when the whole thing is so delicate tasting.

I ended up with a mix of mint, caramel, peanut butter, hazelnut, strawberry, and champagne truffles, and was even allowed to pick one additional sample truffle!

I finally decided on the earl grey, caramel, and kahlua. The caramel tasted like one of those Ghirardelli chocolate squares with caramel in the middle - my favorite! To be honest, I couldn't really taste the earl grey or kahlua.. but there were still delicious anyways! \n\nI noticed they brought out two new flavors with white chocolate while I was sitting outside. I love white chocolate so I had to go back in and grab another one. I was trying to decide between the Black and White and Casimira's Favorite. I ended up choosing Casimira's Favorite, vanilla covered in white chocolate. It was amazing!! Quite sweet but definitely my favorite. \n\nAlso, almost forgot to mention that each truffle only costs 75 cents! And if you get coffee or tea, you get a free truffle. The prices can't get any more reasonable than that. I also noticed quite a bit of discounts if you buy in bulk. I saw 20 for $12, but didn't really pay attention to the larger packs.", "author": "Stephanie C."}

I dedicate this to a sweet little (literally - it's cramped inside) shop I found the first time I was wandering North Beach. Offering up about 20 flavors of hand-made truffles, this shop of chocolate-ly, truffle-ly goodness is run by husband and wife duo Jean-Marc (of Fringale, apparently) and Casimira.\n\nAs of several months ago (pricing may have changed), you could buy inidividual bite-sized truffles at $0.75 per, or in quarter pound increments of about 20 truffles each, up to an entire pound, served up in Chinese take-out containers at ~$12 per quarter pound, in any combination of flavors you so desire.\n\nOf course, the problem with these variety boxes is that, if it's your first time trying these, you may have some difficulty distinguishing flavors, and, well, it's nice to know what you enjoy and what you don't! Having made this exact mistake, take the following with a grain of salt, as some of the flavor associations may be wrong:\n\n* Cognac (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - Pretty darn tasty\n* Honey Vodka (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - Couldn't quite pick this one out\n* Spicy Cayenne Tequila (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - Not bad\n* Vin Rouge/Red Wine (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - Tasty!\n* Caramel (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - Just alright\n* Dark Chocolate (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - This one got a bit lost among the box, probably because it wasn't particularly unique\n* Earl Grey (Cocoa Powder-Dusted) - Another one I couldn't quite place\n\nA bit pricy given their size, but, really, these are pretty strong and flavorful truffles - how quickly are you going to, or should you, really, finish a box of 20? They lasted me a good month, so $12 wasn't all that bad of a deal. Also, while their shop might not look accessible because of the single step to get in, they have a ramp stowed away inside that they're more than happy to bring out should you need it.", "author": "Johnny W."}

That's right : fat bastard.\n\nSo in order to escape with what sort of sanity I had left after being tortured in such a dump (I have a dog so it is very hard to find a place that accepts a medium sized pet) the refuge that would beckon me was XOX Truffles.\n\nI'm a sucker for anything white chocolate, so there is no surprise there in my first selection: smooth, sweet, buttery nothingness that parallels a dip into the very pool set aside by Hades.  If only death were that welcoming, I'd be the first to dive in.  Another special a friend utilized in a supper were the Cayenne Tequila Truffles.....the chocolate souffle was made even more dangerous with the slight shavings of this truffle.  I never knew a piece of chocolate that bit me back.  I spent the rest of the evening patting my blushing lips.  And I'm simple, so ordering an extra box of the caramel were already half gone by the time I was over the GGB.\n\nUnpretentious, fantastic truffles, inexpensive, and kind staff:  what more of a solace could one ask for while escaping the very depths of hell that I had to unfortunately call home?\n\nBe ready to leave with more than 2 pieces.

Best chocolate I have ever had.\n\nThe chocolate is hard enough that it doesn't disintegrate in your hands, but once you pop it in your mouth, the creamy chocolate in the center just melts in your mouth.  It's ridiculousness.\n\nThey have a variety of alcohol-infused chocolates - I tried the cayenne tequila chocolate and it was crazy.  You take it in and the first thing you taste is chocolate.  Then...five seconds later - BAM!  Tequila.  Then fifteen seconds after that, you get a dull cayenne flavor that gradually intensifies.  This is what you experience with the chocolates -  unique chocolates that are multifaceted with distinct flavor.\n\nChocolates cost 75 cents each, which isn't bad for a high end chocolate.  My friend and I got 20 for $10, which averages out to 50 cents each.  They also give you samples for anything/everything you choose to buy.  You could get a small coffee for $1.50 and that'll come with a sample.   That's a good deal.   \n\nI stuck with sweet chocolates.  If you take a look at my picture (front to back), you'll see caramel, green tea, earl grey, hazelnut, and casimira's favourite (white chocolate + something else).  Caramel is my favorite.  Don't miss this place if you're anywhere near fisherman's wharf, Chinatown, or north beach.\n\nThis review is part of my \"AWESOME SF DAYTRIP\" list.

So one for home and one for my friend along with other SF goodies.  Instead of getting the cardboard takeout box for the truffles they were put into the paper bag which allowed them to be smushed on my journey back!

It looks pretty swell in one of their great bags. Their gift boxes get fancier the more you buy.\n\nUSEFUL: Here's a great $30/$40 gift idea for the woman who has everything:\nA $10/$20 box of truffles from XOX and a gift certificate for a $20 mani/pedi at Hand Touch Nail Salon on Chestnut.

The owner is French and make his truffles fresh every day.

There is street parking right out front. \n\nBut this is North Beach so it is best to take transit and walk. North Beach is very easy to walk through.

Honestly I felt that the price was high for the tiny pieces that were pre packaged in the smallest sized chinese take out boxes. They are obviously hand made because of their irregular sizes, some larger and some smaller. \n    Unlike other reviewers I love that they are all in the same box because I'm a fan of guess the chocolate flavor. It's fun.\n\n Most of the flavors were awesome I particularly liked the raspberry, coconut, espresso, peanut butter flavors. The little truffles were covered in cocoa powder and they had a nice snap from the chocolate shell underneath. \n\n Not fond of the lemon ginger or spicy tequila. I think the least favorite was the earl grey  ( that's the only thing I can think it was,  it had a more herbal taste) If it wasn't earl grey it had to be cardamom or something like a spice and was not feeling it at all. \n\n\nI would love to get a larger container next time and i think i'll hand pick the flavors this time since I know what I did like.

I am glad it wasn't over powering and i feel it paired well with their coffee/espresso drinks. very light pb taste and the chocolate (mind you dark chocolate) added a fuller and a little bitter taste to it. mmm good job!\n\nThe amaretto was very memorable, as my sister puts it \"it kept changing flavors\".. yeah not really sis, but it was a full amaretto flavor which didn't over power the truffle. \n\nto be honest everything was well thought out and not overpowering the truffle, very beautiful compliments to each other and a coffee if you had one. \n\nCoffee wasn't the best but they don't boast their coffee, they boast their truffles and it sure met the hype.", "author": "Barnabas L."}

I realize that truffles are supposed to look like their fungal cousins, but the shape of these are extremely irregular and kind of look like that the one making them doesn't take pride in his work. Plus, if the chocolates aren't distinguishable in any way, once you buy more than one variety, you have no idea what you're eating until you put it in your mouth. Which isn't altogether a bad thing, (even though I'm the type of person that wants to save my favorites for last) because this kind of makes it exciting.\n\nThe flavors, for the most part, are fantastic - distinct, yet blended well with the flavor of the chocolate. And if you let them come to cool room temperature as chocolate should be eaten, the texture is phenomenal and the flavors are divine.\n\nThe service is excellent as well. The shop is tiny but usable as long as there's no more than 3 customers in the building at one time.

I'm thinking maybe it was Russian because this store is in relative proximity to Russian Hill.  Now, maybe I'm just assuming that it's a Russian neighborhood because it has \"Russian\" in the name.  Well come on.... do you expect to go to Chinatown and run into a bunch of Polish people?  No, I'm not being racist... just a comedian.\n\nAnywho, the truffles had a more rustic look to them and looked like rugged rocks instead of perfect spheres as we're accustomed to in most places.  The flavors were kind of cool too.  Cognac?  Spicy Cayenne Tequila?  Triple Sec?  Lemon Ginger? French Roast?  a l'orange?\n\nI got 2 of the cognac and 2 of the noisette (hazelnut).  Came out to a whopping $2 and something.... yeah... expensive *sarcasm*\n\nBoth were really good.  The flavor was prominent, but it wasn't overpowering.  I really like both and a small part of me wish I could of had more, but I was saving my appetite for Gary Danko.\n\nI mean... it's chocolate... how can you go wrong?", "author": "Austin S."}

They come in variation of  alcoholic (YES! *woohoo and does happy dance*) and non-alcoholic. There's even a vegan option for you vegan folks. \n\nYour best bet is to get a Chinese box (yes they come in Chinese boxes) of 20 for $10. And you can hand pick which ones you want. They also package and ship them if you you're not in the bay. \n\nMy favorite is the cognac and the spicy tequila. There's a distinctive kick when you have the spicy tequila. Considering the fact that I'm not a cognac drinker, I initially thought it wouldn't be my type of truffle but the cognac is a perfect marriage with the chocolate. The cognac actually makes the truffle better, not overpowering at all!  These truffles are so damn good, I get extra kisses from the bf if I take one right before he lands a pecker on me.

For the past decade, every truffle I have had has been compared to these little odd-shaped truffles from XOX, and none have ever measured up.\n\nLast week when I ventured into North Beach for the first time since I moved to Berkeley four years ago, I found XOX and it made my week again!  The service is extremely friendly.  I also got to see them making the truffles behind the counter by hand, which was really cool and made me feel connected to the chocolate as opposed to huge companies like Godiva and Ghirardelli.  I got two boxes of 20 truffles with 10 dark chocolate and 10 hazelnut each (one was to give away to a friend, which now I wish I didn't!).

I walk aimlessly up Columbus for a cup of coffee at wherever looks promising. Today I avoided my usual (Brioche Bakery) as I had already eaten breakfast and did not want to order another pastry as I knew I would.\n\nI happened upon XOX and saw the sign that said \"Free truffle with a cup of coffee\" I stepped inside, ordered a nonfat capp and got my free truffle while talking to the owner, who was very french and amiable. He recommended the cognac truffle to go with my cappuccino, which I gladly accepted and bit into luxuriously while walking out the door.

The chocolate left no bitter aftertaste and was better than any of that crap you get at Sees.\n\nBefore I even got a block away from the store, I turned around and went back for a second truffle. Just a single Earl Grey truffle. I came back sheepishly, ashamed to have been there less than a minute before and to have already come back. The owner just smiled, grabbed a napkin and some tongs, and asked what I would like in a completely non-patronizing way. As I left, he told me many people do exactly what I just did.\n\nThe truffles are delicious and super creamy, as I said. Highly recommend the cognac, though the earl grey was great too. They are not the sort of things I would give as gifts since they are ugly mis-shaped little lumps (I can make much prettier, almost equally delicious truffles by hand, though my flavors aren't nearly as creative). But they are full of love and heart, and I really appreciate that. Also, they get cool points for even having vegan truffles. I didn't think it was possible, but apparently it is...\n\nI tried to forgive their coffee since they are a chocolate shop, but the cappuccino was so weak it would have lost in a fight to the skinniest kid in elementary school.

No, I'm not talking about indigestion. I'm talking about that terrible clench that twists your insides once you've realized that you really, really screwed up.\n\nAlmost every year, I forget my father's birthday. Sigh.\n\nPerhaps, deep down I'm just trying to forget. It's not like I look forward to my own birthdays. Maybe I just don't want to deal with it. After all, my father is near impossible to shop for. If he wants something, he just goes out and buys it. There isn't much he can't afford. What the heck do buy for someone who already has it all?\n\nHa ha! This year I figured it out. These truffles are the perfect thing.\n \nSadly enough, my father's own dieting has saved me. He'd never order a box of truffles for himself, but I'm sure deep down he'd really like to. Here's where I come in. Since I'm buying this for him as a gift, he has an excuse to take a small break (actually a big one, the last box I sent had 80 truffles) from his diet. The truffles end up serving as a strange 2-in-1 gift: yummy chocolate and a valid excuse to depart from the usual self denial.\n\nThis place is fantastic.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-10-03", "description": "I thought I had a pretty good grasp of how a great chocolate is supposed to taste but I am pleased to announce that my world was turned upside down a few days ago by a sweet little chocolatier by the name XOX Truffles. I've tried chocolates all over the world in Paris, Bavaria, New York, and Los Angeles at names like Vosges, Maison, Payard, and Ricard and many of the chocolatiers to be fair were sinfully good. Undoubtedly the quality of Maison and Payard are amongst the best the world has to offer, but there is another. Nestled at the end of the Columbus drag in North Beach, San Francisco is a little wedge of a shop that serves the best chocolate I have ever tasted at a price that I couldn't and wouldn't believe.\n\nXOX Truffles is a mom and pop styled operation started about 12 years ago by chef Jean Marc Gorce following a heart attack. His days as a French restaurant chef were over, but thank god we weren't robbed of Gorce's talent. Like a phoenix Gorce has soared far beyond the limits of chocolate making known to normal men and I guiltily admit I'm a little happy he is now making his delectable chocolates. In the little shop in North Beach you can meet Gorce and watch him prepare his wonderful truffles and I swear there isn't a humbler person.\n\nFor the most part XOX Truffles come in a variety of traditional liquored and non-liquored flavours. The truffles' appearance is classic, deep in colour, and looks as rich as it tastes. You can tell right away that the truffles were made that morning and it doesn't take watching Gorce make them behind the counter to believe it. My favourite of the flavours is the Tequila Chipotle truffle, but I have to admit the Earl Gray and Champagne were just as good. Even the plain old Dark Chocolate was delectable in its simplicity. Of the five or so flavours I tried my least favourite was the Green Tea which was a bit too strongly powdered for me but once the flavours mixed together it was still good.\n\nMy last favourite chocolatier has been Vosges for a long time, not so much for the quality of their chocolate but their sinful exotic chocolate concoctions with ingredients like Tallegio cheese, Balsamic Vinegar, Sweet Indian Curry, and Hungarian Paprika, and I never would have thought that a traditionally flavoured chocolate could surpass my taste for the exotic but I was very wrong. In comparison to other excellent traditional choclatiers with premium quality truffles XOX surpasses them for two reasons, freshness and price. Every other great chocolatier knows their skill and charges like they know it and then double that, but XOX is unbelievably well priced. Gorce even goes so far as to throw in complementary tasters on small orders like $20 which in the store will get you 40 truffles. Secondly the truffles are just so fresh and so tasty that I still truly believe they are the best I've had. Maybe it was being able to meet Gorce or maybe there's some other secret magic in the truffles but after just one visit I am completely sure that XOX is the best chocolate I've ever eaten.", "author": "Derek F."}

I can't wait to try the other flavors! \n\nNolan: I stop off here to pickup chocolates once every one or two weeks.  These are the best chocolates I have found in San Francisco hands down.  The shop is very simple and focuses on delicious truffles above all else.  My favorites are Black and white, orange, raspberry, french roast, hazelnut, and coconut.  They also make hot chocolate tablets you can take home.  They are easy to prepare by melting them inside a cup placed in boiling water.  After melting add milk and whipped cream to taste and enjoy.  These are a definite hit with the girlfriend!", "author": "SunnyandNolan E."}

I am incredibly critical of all chocolate and know what good (some would argue perfect) chocolate entails. Any chocolatier I review is being put under very serious scrutiny. Also, I will not review any chocolatier I have worked for or consulted with. Some major players will be left out, but it will also avoid any bias. \n\nI like XOX. I like them for what they are. They are honest truffles made by hand, sold without ridiculous couture-level chocolate packaging and markups. They are sold with coffee, which speaks of their purpose: to bring sweetness to an otherwise normal moment. \n\nWith that in mind, the truffles perfectly fill their role. They are spartan: roughly shaped gobs of ganache with ill-tempered chocolate shells rolled in whatever coating (if necessary) will make identifying their flavor less cumbersome. \n\nThese are truffles any of us could make (and some of us do, better) for holiday gifts. They are traditional, rational, and incredibly tasty. They are truffles for yourself, truffles to eat with their organic coffee. Truffles to reward yourself with after climbing to Coit Tower. \n\nBut, if I give one piece of advice it is this: if you are thinking of gifting these truffles... Don't. Look up a recipe online, find a store that sells bulk Valrhona (this will be the best you can find in bulk), and make your own.", "author": "Train W."}

I have a few things I enjoy every so often, but rarely do I go out of my way for chocolate - or any sweets for that matter. I concentrate more on the \"bitter\" end of the tastes spectrum.\n\nThat said, Cubby and Shada were in town this weekend and we decided to go on a tour of the city in the drizzling rain. We went to some of the usual tourist spots - the Mission, Twin Peaks, and Alamo Square. As we made our way past China Town, and headed to North Beach I suggested we stop at XOX truffles.\n\nThis is the home of one of the \"top ten chocolatiers in America\" (as awarded by somebody or another who knows about such things). It's an unassuming store front West of North Beach on Columbus Avenue. If you walked past the place, you'd assume that they are a small cafe. Upon entry you find a large glass case to your left with three shelves of the most oddly shaped (and endearing) truffles you'll ever see.\n\nThe place was started by Jean-Marc Gorce. He had some background in the food industry, but decided he wanted to start something of his own. So he opened shop with is wife in 1998. You can read more about him and his success at the website.\n\nThese truffles aren't the polished truffles of Godiva or other upscale chocolatiers. These are tiny, misshapen, handmade lumps. If you judged them by appearance, you probably wouldn't buy them. But taking a bite of one changes you whole impression. These are amazingly deep in flavor, texture is smooth, creamy and dense. They really are amazingly dense. The flavor of the chocolate is there, and the overtones flavor (or undertones depending) swells up as they melt on your tongue.\n\nI'm not sure what type of chocolate he uses, but the dusting of cocoa powder on some varieties is bitter, dark and dry, which perfectly compliments the richness of the interior.\n\nThey are amazingly low priced - an assortment of 40 truffles for $16 really can't be beat. Some of our favorites are the Earl Grey, the Caramel, Cognac and Hazelnut.\n\nWe sometimes get an assortment, and then take small nibbles of each, sharing them, while trying to guess their flavors.", "author": "tjay f."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-06", "description": "I've been going to XOX since 1999 and I am fanatically addicted to their truffles.  I've been a chocoholic all my life, on the quest for the best chocolate ever, but this is it - once I found XOX, I stopped looking.\n\nI was in XOX one day a few years ago when the Editor-in-Chief of Chocolatier magazine stopped by.  She was compiling their \"10 Best Chocolates in America\" issue, and XOX had just been selected as one of the 10.  I overheard her tell the owner that - while she wasn't able to say it in print - XOX Truffles were her FAVORITES of the top 10.  Imagine that - XOX Truffles are the favorite chocolates of the Editor-in-Chief of Chocolatier Magazine!\n\nI live in the Marina and there are two chocolate stores on one block in my neighborhood (and, get this, a third set to open in the old Kimmel's Stationery location).  I've been to both - boooring. \n\nMost truffles are as much about presentation and shelf life as they are about flavor.   Whereas, XOX Truffles are fragile, lumpy, irregular...there's no stiffeners in them to make a glossy outer coat that holds up well and looks pretty, but tastes like wax.   XOX is all about the taste and the mouth feel, and - they got it just right.\n\nWith something like 22 flavors (or is it up to 25 now?) , there's something for everyone.  They have soy vegan truffles, and white chocolate truffles, and \"liqueur de\" truffles...cognac, triple sec, kahlua... I have so many favorites it's impossible to list them, but in particular I love the orange, liqueuer de noisette (hazelnut), citron (lemon), Earl Grey, and caramel.    Check out the flavors page on their web site for a full listing.\n\nI usually get a hot chocolate covered in yummy whipped cream (the real stuff) and sit outside at one of the outdoor tables (there's also seating inside, but this is a TINY store so don't bring your laptop and expect to spread out - ain't going to happen.)\n\nYou get a free truffle, any flavor you like, with a coffee or other drink.\n\nYou can mail order these truffles, or buy gift boxes that are just beautiful.  I give these as gifts, and they would make great party favors at a wedding or other event.\n\nAnother fun thing about XOX is the location - there's a great mix of Boho locals, and tourists.  So if you hang out there,  you can meet an amazing array of interesting people.  I don't stop by unless I have an hour to kill because I inevitably get caught up in a conversation.\n\nAnd, if business is slow (which it never is)  you might get to chat with Jean-Marc Gorce, the handsome co-owner (with his wife Casimira).  Jean-Marc is an immigrant from France, and Casimira is from the Philippines - they both have backgrounds in restaurant and food service.  Pre-XOX, Jean-Marc was chef de cuisine at Fringale Restaurant, and Casimira was a food rep for a local supplier, so they both know the local restaurant/food scene inside and out.\n\nMost of the truffles at XOX are Jean-Marc's original creations (a few were based on requests from Casimira).  Jean-Marc is friendly and approachable, but at the same time, he has that old-school French politeness where every customer is special, and he's completely focused on you while he's serving you.  I don't know how he still does that after all these years!\n\nAll the truffles are made by Jean-Marc by hand.  It's fascinating to sit there and watch him.  I think he must make truffles in his sleep after all these years.\n\nThey have a store in Montclair, if you live in the east Bay - I've never been to that one - since North Beach is essentially in my back yard, I don't need to travel to get my choco fix :-)\n\nAnd, if you feel like a sandwich, Young next door in the hole-in-the-wall sandwich shop makes the most amazing sandwiches.  I get the club, on toasted whole wheat, slices of bacon, and a side of butterfly pasta.  I don't know what magic ingredient she puts in, but her sandwiches are to die for.", "author": "Alexandra D."}

Keep your eye out, because you might pass right by it and not know it.  If you are driving by, you might get lucky and find a space conveniently out front and can pick your flavors, while keeping an eye on the meter outside.  You can find their products at stores such as Neiman Marcus, too.  But it's more fun to go to the store, so you can customize your own selection.  Plus, they give you a freebie, or two, with your purchase.  They're now located in Oakland, too.\n\nI was intrigued by how XOX Truffles began, when I saw stories about and interviews with the owners.  And how the truffles look.  And the list of flavors.  Finally, I got a chance to stop by the shop and purchase some of their heavenly chocolates.  I even chat with Jean-Marc, if he is in the shop.  He is very friendly and obviously has a passion for what he does.  The chocolates are highly rated by the experts, ya know.  You might even catch him making a fresh batch, tossing them in the chocolate powder.  The truffles are in what looks like a mini-delicatessen display case.  With big bowls of the various flavors.  I usually get a mix of the flavors, but forget which is which, until I bite into them.  Almost all of them are similar on the outside, dusted in chocolate powder.  That little tiny takeout box is a treasure trove of wonderful flavors.  They're bite sized and very manageable.  So, I don't feel too guilty if I eat the entire box...over a few days.  But, I try to share, if I have the willpower.  Best is to eat them as soon as possible.  Otherwise, once refrigerated at home, the flavors blend and can harden a bit.  They're probably meant to be eaten ASAP, since they're freshly made, with high quality ingredients.  Besides, you aren't supposed to save chocolates, but enjoy them right away!  My favorite is the Caramel.  WARNING: Do not sit at your desk with a box of XOX Truffles within reach...\n\nNext, you need to try the hot chocolate.  It's the BEST I've ever tasted.  I believe it's a chocolate tablet, which is melted down in the cup, with warm milk.  Not too sweet and just right.  Very creamy and so comforting.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-06-02", "description": "Let me preface this by saying that this style of truffle is easy to make yourself, in the comfort of your own kitchen.  To do this really, REALLY well is another matter.  It is upon this point , in fact, that my debate over XOX rages with a coworker of mine.  My thought is that just because I can make, for example, a killer risotto at home does not mean I can't rave about someone else's.  She disagrees, to put it mildly.\n\nUpon that line, XOX makes some of the best French truffles in San Francisco and, reportedly, the country.  Even my significant other, who only likes milk chocolate, is addicted.  The only two people I've ever seen here are Jean-Marc (owner and chef) and a woman whom I think is his wife.  The chocolates look more like a truffle mushroom than a chocolate, but the exquisite flavor within belies the humble exterior of each creation.  My favorites are the cognac (the house specialty) and rum coco flavors, although \"seasonal\" selections have included tequila-and-cayenne, and an incredible ginger vodka.  Feel free to ask any questions about the chocolate -- they will be answered honestly, even if it entails bashing a particular flavor.  For example, don't buy the matcha green tea truffles, because NOBODY thinks they're good enough.  Otherwise, the chocolate itself is rich, and the liquors and flavors tend to be very prominent.\n\nFor the optimal experience with these truffles, either eat them once they've achieved room tempurature, or let them warm and melt slowly in your mouth.  Jean-Marc even suggests this, and who wouldn't take his advice?", "author": "Nick B."}

I try to refer people and let them know that it's a nice place to stop if you're ever in the neighborhood. I recently got some for my girlfriend on Valentines day and she loved it. However we opened a box and some of them had been crushed, and some had chocolate melting out from the middle. I was bummed but I still loved them.", "author": "Kale T."}

XOX truffles are pretty good, and they have nice texture. They do one thing very well. If you're in the mood for a traditional French truffle, they will satisfy your craving.

In a city renowned for it's dining this chocolate lovers paradise is unrivaled.  Knowing me for the chocolate fiend that I am, and well aware of my uh 'discerning palate' my brother introduced me to XOX a few years back while he was living nearby in North Beach.  \n\nThe store is open 9am-6pm Mon-Sat which while not ideal for someone that lives in the South Bay such as myself, is still workable.  Occasionally the store will be closed on one of it's normal days, or earlier than listed but it's certainly worth the risk.  The entire range of 20+ flavors are all wonderful.  Personally I am particularly fond of the caramel, dark chocolate, kahlua, french roast and hazelnut.  Though as a bit of a purist, I definitely purchase the dark chocolate in larger quantities than any other.  The exquisite handmade truffles are crafted in small organic looking shapes (rather than the manufactured looking coated spheres you find many other places) and usually dusted in cocoa powder.  Every truffle will literally melt in your mouth, releasing flavors that are simply blissful.  Chef Jean-Marc Gorce is usually present and making new batches.  If the store isn't busy he's happy to chat with customers.  His wife Casmira is often behind the counter as well and is the perfect advisor if you're having a difficult time making a flavor decision.  \n\nWhether it's as a gift, or just for yourself, I can't do enough to encourage anyone and everyone to at least journey to this small treasure at least once and sample what is truly one of San Francisco's finest culinary treats.", "author": "Adam W."}

Their coffee is pretty standard but it's cheaper than most places around North Beach and comes a free truffle -- the truffles are seriously amazing. My roommate got so sick of me talking about these truffles and of me telling him repeatedly he should get coffee here in the morning when he doesn't even drink coffee and apparently doesn't love truffles the way I do. His loss. My two favorites (and trust me, I have tried them all) are hazelnut and dark chocolate. I wasn't so much a fan of the caramel one because it ends up being almost overly sweet when you eat it. I always get people the boxes of truffles for thank you gifts, etc. and they love me more for it. Okay maybe they don't love me more but they love the truffles for sure and I'm willing to pretend that means they love me more. You can get a premade mix in a box (that they keep in the fridge) or you can choose your own.

The Chinese takeout containers are now $22 for 40 truffles, $44 for 80 (1 lb.).  As I was looking for a communal gift for a group gathering, I opted for the harlequin gift box, a fine looking container, no doubt about it, with festive bow to boot.  The employee said it would take a few minutes to prepare (there were no other customers at the time).  I had the honor of paying $65, not the prorated $55 one might naively expect given the increased quantity purchased, as I belatedly realized during her \"preparation.\"  Upon the gift being opened the following evening, the preparation revealed itself: the truffles were now in a sealed celophane bag.  Had I been charged an extra $5 for this packaging in lieu of the steamed rice box, I would have felt hustled.  Lucky for me I was charged $10.
