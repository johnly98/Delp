But my experience here was so utterly disappointing. I got to the cafe around 3pm on Sunday (yesterday), so hopefully some owner/manager can figure out who was working at this time and let them know that their behavior was unacceptable. \n\nMy main complaint: the workers here are terribly unfriendly. The guy at the register took my order and punched it in without a single smile, and seemed impatient when I took an extra 5 seconds to figure out which cookie I wanted. One of the other workers behind the counter wasn't at the register, but was grabbing the pastries for customers. She asked me which cookie I wanted, so I asked her for the one with pistachios in it. She didn't get the one I wanted (I guess there were two types with pistachios) so I apologized profusely and asked her to get the other one. She responded irritatedly with \"That cookie doesn't have pistachios in it.\" I apologized again and asked her to get the other one anyway, and she begrudgingly got it for me -- NO SMILE the entire time. When I sat down to eat the cookie, guess what? There were pistachios in it. \n\nThe food itself wasn't bad at all. I got a cookie with chocolate chips and nuts (sweet but not overly so), a cafe latte, and a scoop of stracciatella gelato (expensive pricing for tiny portions, but expected for such a touristy area). \n\nIt was a busy day, so maybe the workers were just feeling grumpy or overworked.

There were not too many patrons to clutter my perspective. \n\nUpon arrival I noticed that many of the tables had not been cleared and the garbage was overflowing. Not to worry, we took a space in the corner and found it to be dilapidated picnic table, sticky with the previous patrons' food items. While patiently waiting for our food I had the perfect vantage point to observe one of the staff members who was attending to all the garbage duties. After finishing those tasks he promptly resumed taking food to the patrons' tables without washing his hands!!! Yuck! We watched the staff curse one another in a jocular manner, completely inattentive to the patrons who were entering and leaving the cafe. No wonder I had to ask twice to get my cake. \n\nAfter paying $18 (including tip) for two espressos and a cheesecake, one might expect a pleasant experience. No, it wasn't spoiled by an inebriated homeless dude or a noisy tourist bus. Emporia Rulli managed to bungle it all on their own. \n\nHow can they afford this location which such crappy service?!!??

I came here with my very sweet mother-in-law who wanted a cold coffee drink in the warm afternoon. She preferred a white mocha over ice, which was not on the menu, so tentatively asked if it was an off-menu possibility. Now, I have been to many coffee shops, ranging from the snooty to the down-to earth and have never been looked at like this lady did when she smirked at her and said, 'no, we can't; this isn't Starbucks'.......Wow, I was shocked at the gall of this smarmy little brat. So this wasn't Starbucks? I could've sworn I saw that green mermaid lady on the front door. (dramatic eye roll) Instead of intervening and saying all the wonderfully sarcastic things that came to mind about 10 minutes after we left, I stood by speechless and my MIL ordered a mocha over ice instead.\nThe moral of the story is this: If a coffee shop doesn't make something I'm looking for, they should (and have, until this place) suggest something they have that is similar, in a helpful way. They can think whatever they want about my lesser sophisticated way of drinking coffee but customers service shouldn't slip.

We shared mochas and our absolute favorite: TIRAMISU!\n\nIn the middle of one of the busiest parts of San Francisco, the FiDi/Downtown of S.F. offers shopping, fine dining, local eateries, hot dog stands and entertainment. What I find is culture and where there is culture lies some sumptuous desserts & coffees!\n\nUpside: For coffee and desserts, Emporio is a little pricey with a cup of coffee w/ a single shot averaging to $5+ and desserts starting at $3. You'll be able to feel the quality and love put into everything they offer at Emporio. Yes, they definitely do serve alcohol for those seeking something cold & refreshing after a long morning of shopping for the women and holding those shopping bags for the men (& vice versa). Buy a hot dog from Stanley's Steamers (located across the street in front of Macy's), buy a pint of your favorite and sit down to a good snack. \n\nDownside: The only thing that surprised me about this place was seeing a slice of prosciutto and three thinly sliced slices of cantaloupe on a large plate priced for $10. I guess it can work for those who are on meager mode. \n\nEither way, it's delicious; patrons will be able to reflect on their day, enjoy the brisk air, encounter a pigeon or two and can really enjoy some coffee in/outdoors and have a conversation without the hustle & bustle of a Starbucks.", "author": "Carol L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-11-20", "description": "As a big fan of Rulli's main location in Larkspur and their old Chestnut St cafe, during my last visit to SF I walked to Union Square in anticipation of a special breakfast. Despite the smaller variety of items offered at this location, the quality is still pretty good. Not quite at the same level is their customer service. Having more customers than tables is indeed positive for a business, a sign of success. However, it forces to make pesky decisions, like whether to give out numbers or assign tables only to parties that have all their people present. Rulli at Union Square decided to dispense with all these old school solutions and settled for a more revolutionary approach. Anyone, independently of their arrival time or position in line, can claim rights on a table by marking it with any available item. Today I was told by the staff that I had to eat standing because two tables were occupied by umbrellas and one by a bottle of water. I am not penalizing Rulli for choosing this rule, which obviously goes in the direction of increased democracy and gives everyone a chance, independently of untolerable privileges to which people who arrived earlier feel entitled. However, I must lower my rating due to their failure to inform the customers on the best strategies to win a table. My suggestion to future patrons is to bring a deck of cards and swiftly launch them on any available table as soon as they enter the door. This way one can beat any other customer trying to walk to the table to leave some paraphernalia on it before joining the line.

OJ is pucker-sweet fresh and sandwiches (which suspiciously seem to be a culinary students' version of the Egg McMuffin) are assembled between homemade sliced bread.  I don't recommend the sandwiches.  Go for the drinks and pastries.  The whole menu is crazy affordable for being ground zero in tourist territory.\n\nThe location is a terrific place to people watch on a sunny day.

Bad idea - the horrible service completely ruined my post-facial high.  It started with Huiqiang at the register.  The guy couldn't be bothered with helping customers.  I asked for a Tacchino sandwich (he didn't offer to add a salad), a decaf cappuccino and a pan dolce cookie.  Huiqiang asked, \"Which pan dolce?\" (is there more than one in the case?) but didn't bother to follow me when I went to show it to him in the case.  Then he gave me a number for the sandwich that was being heated and grilled and told me to wait for my coffee.  The guy with the sandwich was ready before my coffee so he went looking for my number.  I stopped him and let him know that I'm waiting for my coffee.  Seeing me carrying 2 bags, my pan dolce and receipt, he proceeds to hand me my sandwich on a plate.  I told him that I need help carrying the sandwich because I needed one free hand for my coffee and pointed to a table outside.  He said he didn't want to take my sandwich outside and risk the birds taking it.  I asked if 1) he could wait a couple minutes until I get my coffee so we could walk out together or 2) I'll take the sandwich and he can bring me my coffee when it's ready.  He said, \"No, I can't do that.\"  What?!?  CAN'T bring me coffee?  Is the guy on a leash that prevents him from walking more that 10 feet from the cafe?!?  It was 2 PM and no other customers inside the cafe!  Even more ridiculous was another employee sitting in an interior corner table who laughed and rolled his eyes as if to say, \"yeah, the crazy things customers ask for.\"  To top it all off, the guy behind the counter hands me my cappuccino and says, \"uh, thank you\" implying that I was a difficult/rude customer.\n\nThe whole staff couldn't care less about customers much less providing service.  Glad I didn't tip but really wish I hadn't given them my business at all.  \n\nAs for the food, it was ok - certainly not worth putting up with the poor service and attitude of the staff.\n\nRECOMMENDATION:  Enjoy the square but get your coffee, sandwich or snack elsewhere and grab a seat on the steps or chairs around the park.

Our order was two iced coffees and one iced tea.  The iced coffee's came with no problems, but it seems that there was maybe a communication barrier when we mentioned \"iced tea\".  Though it clearly states iced tea as a menu item, it seemed as though no one ever ordered it.  The tea came hot in a mug, when asked for the iced tea, they simply provided a large glass of ice.  When we had asked the server to add the tea and the ice, he was about to pour the cup of ice into the FULL mug of HOT tea - not brilliant.  \n\nWe had also ordered a chocolate croissant and a regular croissant - both were pretty tough to eat.\n\nI'd definitely think twice about going to this coffee shop again!", "author": "Michelle N."}

The premise: My fiance and I had walked past some dive named David's Delicatessen awhile back, and we were intent on going back into SF to give its \"highly-touted\" breakfast (so the window sign read) a try. \n\nSo Saturday morning, we get up at 8am and trek our way into SF damn skipping sure that we know exactly what we we're getting into w/o first consulting Yelp... or a map. At 9:30am, we're still looping endlessly through SF, wandering in and out of the Tenderloin, gingerly avoiding crackos and be-slippered hobos, working ourselves into a grump. \n\nAt 10am, fiance suggests that we perhaps settle for a different deli/cafe- perhaps Peet's? Or Starbucks? I flat out refuse. Aside from walking past 10 or 15 different Starbucks, (all within 20 blocks of each other, all mocking me with their carbon copy signs displaying frothy holiday drinks) I want to go some place new. Some place \"different.\" After all, I've just walked who-knows-how-many-miles of rolling SF hills; I don't want another Costco scone. \n \nWe end up at Union Square for a break and- well what do you know! There's a cafe right on the square! The crowd looks schmoozy and international, and the architecture suggests bad food, but we're hungry & not-so-hot ourselves (what with the sweat from the walk.) We order two cups of coffee and two pastries, and the total comes to --brace yourself-- a mindblowing $18. \n\n$18. For a pair of coffee & pastries. \n\nSneaky sneaky, guys... Not listing the prices of each food item next to their displays. Kindof a mean-spirited way to take advantage of the customer who doesn't want to appear gauche by asking for a price tag. You got me (finger guns). \n\nLong story short, the coffee was decent and the pastries were stale. Did I mention I paid $18 for the privilege? But maybe that's not the point. Maybe the point is the lovely scenery atop Union Square, appreciation of the rare San Francisco sun poking its head out from behind Karl the Fog, the ice skaters in the winter, the artists setting up their booths in the summer. \n\nAnyway, I later found out that David's Deli is rated an impressive 1.5 stars on yelp (dodge a bullet there, at least) and learned my real lesson: Bring a sandwich and enjoy the free view.", "author": "Tianyi S."}

There was nothing spectacular about the drink.  It took me a while to get to the hot chocolate and it was hard not to get any whipped cream on my nose because the chocolate was super thick.

If they had the smallest competition they would be so closed!\n\nThe waiters that ignore you, the papers on the floor, and the dirty tables are not inviting, whatsoever. What particularly amazes me is the \"Hyper-specialization\": if you happen to order, as we did, a salad, a tea, and a pastry; they may come to you at three different times because apparently one person takes care of the food, another one brews the teas and who knows who's in charge at the \"pastry department\" (one of us had to go inside to eventually get it!) \n\nThe long lines inside are just a turn off, and the staff is too rude to be true. Surprisingly, and for the first time, yesterday I saw a waiter taking someone's order (yes, he physically went to the table, menus on his hand, and in a few minutes took note of the requested food and drinks) and I wondered: Are they paying more that I am? Are they really that much cuter? Is their accent funnier than mine?\n\nYes, sitting outside, having a nice coffee while reading the paper and/or watching people go by is certainly very pleasant; but the dirtiness, the rudeness, the messiness, and the insufficient and inept waiting staff simply makes the whole enchantment vanish.

The outdoor tables are packed, but if you are patient and take the time to look, you'll definitely be able to find a spot. We decided an afternoon brew on one of the only sunny days we've had in awhile sounded amazing. I was assigned table duty and found a great spot right outside the front doors. He got us two beers and a delicious ham and brie sandwich, omg yes please. The brie was perfectly creamy, and the whole sandwich had amazing flavor. Of course we decided to order a second beer, because that weather was much to nice to pass up! The only downfall was that their bathroom was across the way and down the stairs in their garage, so if you know you will need to go you should plan in advance. All of their other food looked really good- like their salads and olive plates, and of course their pastries. Their pitcher of sangria also looked like a great idea, which I will definitely be back for with friends on my next sunny day shopping trip!", "author": "Sonya D."}

Speedy service, a huge selection of food (salads, sandwiches, pastries galore, which I haven't ventured into yet), outdoor seating which, is always kept clean. They are a bit pricey compared to other local coffee shops but its a nice spot to sit down and enjoy a great cup of coffee in the heart of union square.", "author": "morgan a."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-06-29", "description": "If it weren't for the location, I would've been saying \"Why won't Yelp let us give a place ZERO stars??\" If you'll notice, the best reviews are all about the location. They're true. It's a beautiful locale. It's great to sit outside and see all the tourists and locals. But the food/drink is an embarrassment to the city. If this is what is supposed to represent San Francisco cafe society, I hang my head in shame. I've had mediocre coffee here before. Today, I was ready to order an iced coffee because of the heat, but decided to go for gelato instead. I ordered two flavors like any good Italian order would be and I got a dixie cup with my 2 scoops in it. I'm not exaggerating. It was a dixie cup with the Emporio Rulli logo and colors on it! It was such a small cup that they couldn't maneuver the standard side-by-side gelato service in it. What's worse, the gelato was only so-so and it cost me $3.50!  I was expecting at least a regular \"small\" cup if anything, but not a dixie cup! I would steer everyone to Naia in North Beach where, although the cups are also small, they are large enough to fit a good serving into it and they put more thought and effort into their flavors. Rulli only offers 5, maybe 6, flavors.... all of the American persuasion... vanilla, coffee, mint chip, vanilla. I can't remember the 5th.\n\nI'm not expecting American-size scoops as big as my head, but give me SOMETHING for my money. Gelato is NOT more expensive to make and there really is no reason to charge more for it other than the \"exotic\" name of gelato. \n\nLocals/Tourists - buy your coffee here if you must, but buy food, pastries, and gelato elsewhere! I can recommend Naia for gelato in North Beach; crepes and chocolates at Crepe o Chocolat on off O'Farrel and Stockton (near Crate and Barrel), frozen yogurt at Fro Yo on Market and 3rd, and pastries at Boulangerie on Market. I think Caffe de la Presse would even be a good alternative.", "author": "Maria Y."}

The paninis were pre-made and horrible, with wilted greens and just not good in general. How can you mess up a panini? The service was atrocious and you can't tell where to sit for service. The waiter actively avoided us for the first 10 minutes while we sat and waited for menus.", "author": "Lisa k."}
