It doesn't look like much from the outside, but for tired tourists hangry from a full day of travel this place hit the spot. \n\nThe interior is very modern and clean with seat yourself service at the bar about 5 high top tables and some long couch benches that run along the wall. Our group of 3 was lucky to find 2 stools at the bar and the bartender was kind enough to grab a 3rd from a back room for us to squeeze in. \n\nThe beer selection is great with about 20ish brews on tap, many of them local to California. They also offer a pretty good wine selection. I stuck with the Huckleberry - a tart cider with a sour aftertaste...big fan! \n\nI tried the duck tacos and a side of fries with scallion aioli, with my dinner companions opting for the vegan burger and the chicken torpedo. Those fries with the aioli.....so SO good! Tacos were okay and my pals enjoyed their meals. We can back here for a second time during our visit for dinner and drinks once again as it was one of the most reasonably priced places in the area.

I believe they serve their burger over a brioche bun and usually give you a side of salad or a small order of fries with your order. Definitely one of the up and coming spots on Market and it's right next to the Orpheum. Only con about this place is the fact that there's very very VERY limited seating but alas, it's SF. \n\nThis place gets a 5/5 for it's great selection of craft beers and wine if you're feeling a bit classy. BUT the star of the show goes to their duck fat fries. DUCK. FAT. FRIES. Three things that would on their own dangerously send anyone in their mid 50's to a visit with their cardiologist.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-02", "description": "Great new place to pass the time when you're in the area. I gotta give this place a closer to a 4.5 than 5.  My group and I were lucky to nab one of the couch areas, but if we didn't I'd probably rate it a bit lower since the space is limited, especially during a Friday afternoon. We came early because we wanted to kill time before Hamilton and it was fine between 5-6PM, but starting around 6:30 people ended up walking out after not finding a place to sit or stand. \n\n| LOCATION | \n\nClose to Bart/on Market so it's easy to get to. It's easy to miss though since it's a small location and they only have their logo on the window. \n\nThe inside of the place is quite narrow with a corner couch section to the left of when you walk in and in the back. They have a couple bar seats and a few 2 seater tables lining the wall. The bathrooms are all the way in the back, but for the most part they were quite clean. Even though the place got packed, it wasn't crazy loud where I couldn't hear someone in my group speaking. They do a good job of also keeping the doorway clean and making sure that people can get from the front to the back area. \n\n| FOOD | Both $14 & came with an option of fries or salad. You also order your food/drinks right at the bar and they give you a number and bring it to your table. \n\n- Chicken Sandwich - I wasn't a fan of this. They do give you a large portion of chicken in the middle but i'm not used to having my sandwiches with cheese. My BF enjoyed the slaw they had on the top, but it was too spicy for my liking. \n\n- Smoked Cheddar Cheeseburger (originally $12 but additional items are $2 each) - Can't go wrong with this. It seems like a fave since I saw a ton of people order it. The meat was nice and juicy, tasty cheese, and the acme bun delicious! They add the aioli on the bread, but as for the rest of the condiments like the tomatoes, arugula, pickles, etc they put it on the side so you can add it to your burger yourself. \n\n- Fries - Nice cut steak fries! They were fried to perfection without being dried out. \n\n- Dungy Roll ($20) - My friend tried this and said it was good, but could have been better without the egg on top. The bread held up well with the sauce, but you could tell that the juices were seeping through the bread and that it wouldn't be good later. \n\n| DRINKS |  All drinks were reasonably priced between $6-$8 & they had a decent selection\n\n- Huckleberry Cider ($7) - I've never tried this Two Rivers brew so I was excited to try it. As with other ciders it tastes like juice, but that's the appeal. I really enjoyed this since it was sweet but not overpowering and at 6.5% your girl can't complain! \n\nI also tried my friends pineapple/berry sours and they were pretty tasty! The pineapple was definitely more acidic and a little too much in my opinion so i'd opt for the other one since it's more subtle. Others in our group got IPAs such as Pliny the Elder and agreed that the hype is worth it! It's great that they had this on tap because other places are pretty limited with their stock.\n\n| SERVICE | \n\nPretty hands off since you order right at the beginning. The silverware/napkins are on the table and they bring you the ketchup, etc when they bring the food to the table. They do come by often to clean up empty plates and cups which is nice.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

Coming from Pittsburgh to San Francisco for business and having not done any research of the area I was staying I am happy with my find.  Fermentation lab overall was a solid choice and for craft beer fans this place won't wow you, but will satisfy your cravings.\nThe space is small and was packed when we first went in, I am fine with this so long as I eventually get a comfortable seat and I did.  The service was pretty quick and cordial. Bonus when they remember your name for adding beers to the open tab.  I really get frustrated when a place isn't packed and the same bartender needs to ask 2-3x's what your name is.\nSince this is a beer centric bar I will comment on their tap list.  A well curated tap list to me beats out the places with 60+ beers on tap any day. Fermentation Lab did just this, 20ish beers, 3 that I was interested were kicked unfortunately, but that's fine.  They had classics, sours, dark/rich stouts, pale ales, and New England style IPAs.  They also keep it as local as possible another bonus. Beers were also served in glassware that reflected the style and was thoroughly cleaned.\nOnto the food.  I first ordered the duck fat fries. The fries were the thick cut steak fries that are too often underdone.  These fries were crispy and had a good season to them, but something was underwhelming.  They were good while drinking a hazy ipa, but I wasn't at all wowed and if I should ever go back would probably try something else.  For my main course I grabbed the duck tacos.  They were the star of the show.  Real tortillas and two of them moped up the saucy duck and pickled veggies.  This was a rich 4-6 bite meal.  Satisfying and glad I had moved onto a crisp pilsner to clean the richness off my tongue.", "author": "Josh C."}

I ordered the fried chicken sandwich, instead, and the other ordered the burger. I liked the sandwich more!\n\nThe ratio of chicken to other ingredients in the sandwich and to the bread was perfect. There were just enough veggies and sour sauce to perfectly complement the fried chicken's flavor and texture. I don't usually eat bread, but I ate (most of) the bread. Each bite elicited a satisfied \"mmmm\" from me. This has become my current fave fried chicken sandwich!\n\nAnd it isn't just the chicken sandwich I would go back for. The duck fat fries are not to be missed! In addition to yummy duck fat taste, they have a bit sweetness... and I love that salty-sweet. \n\nThe restaurant/bar itself is unassuming and no-frills.

It seems like a pretty new spot, maybe under 6 months old? \n\nThey have an awesome combination of a really nice food menu and a fantastic beer list (plus some wines and sodas). They had Pliny the Elder on tap (like every other time I've tried it, I thought it was good but overrated for all the hype) and lots of other great options. Everything is more or less local, from SF or the North Bay or the East Bay with a few from a little further but still in CA. I found what is possibly my new favorite beer here- Le Merle by North Coast brewing which was an awesome saison. Really really good. \n\nFood wise they have a bunch of interesting stuff- house cured salmon, duck, crab, charcuterie, cheese, fried chicken, and more. I decided to try their burger and added bacon marmalade for a $1. Very solid burger and at $12 the price was perfect too. Delicious Acme bun, some lightly seasoned arugula, super fresh tomatoes, a little scallion aioli, and the bacon marmalade which was really delicious. The actual party could have used a little more flavor and seasoning but with the other components, it was an awesome burger. I would get this again or try the other menu options as there was a bunch of things that sounded intriguing. The burger comes with fries or a salad; I opted for the fries. Thick cut steak fries, a lot of the other people seemed to really like this but I thought they were just ok- I wished they were again a little more seasoned and crispier. \n\nIt is a pretty small spot and quite busy so you may have to wait a bit to find a seat or stand. They've done a nice job utilizing the space they have though and it doesn't seem crazy crowded or anything. Not great for huge groups but if you have 5 or fewer people you can probably find a spot. \n\nI would probably give them somewhere between 4 and 5 stars based on my initial visit.

I ran into Peter L outside and we decided to go grab one more drink. After doing a quick search, I picked Fermentation Lab. We walked in on Wednesday, March 11th around 11pm.\n\n*Belgian: Le Merle, North Coast, Fort Bragg, 7.9%, 16oz ($7)\n*Session Blonde: Foam Top, Beachwood, Long Beach, 5.5%, 16oz ($6)\n*Pilsner: Free Kittens, Berryessa, Winters, 5.5%, 16oz ($6)\n\nI actually wanted to try the Redemption, but they were out, so I got the Le Merle per the bartender's recommendation. Now I'm not really versed in beer at all, but I thought this was okay. Good for sipping since we were there for almost two hours. I ended up splitting the Free Kittens with Peter as my second drink. I actually enjoyed this more, so maybe I'm more of Pilsner girl?\n\nFun place to try some beers. The kitchen closes before 11pm, so we weren't able to sample any of the food here. I think that's a good excuse to come back. Plus, I can finally try the Redemption.", "author": "Elena N."}

The beers lean towards being craft vs. your typical draft that you see at a dive bar, which means smaller pours but more interesting flavors. \n\nWhat was surprising was the food - the chicken sandwich + duck fat fries blew me out of the water. I didn't even order it; my friend was the one who wanted to eat and when he took the first few bites he said \"dude. you gotta try this chicken sandwich.\" If I was looking to make those gains I would have for sure ordered two.\n\nIf you're looking for a casual place to chill after work or during a business trip, this small establishment is ideal.

The location is pretty small and the lighting is quite dim, but I can definitely see it getting popular in the future when more people find out about it, especially because they sell Pliny the Elder! \n\nMy friend and I both ordered flights of beer, with Belgians, IPAs, stouts, and porters, but we liked the lighter beers the best. Pliny the Elder was easily our favorite, with the floral tones masking the usually hoppy flavor of IPAs. We also liked the Tiburon Blonde and the Russian River Redemption, but felt that the porters and stouts we tried were either a little watery or had a weird fragrance.\n\nWe also had the fries with scallion aioli which was so good we ordered a second bowl LOL. I usually am not a huge fan of thick cut fries, but these were so crisp on the outside and fluffy inside, and the scallion aioli was buttery and flavorful. Highly recommend this!!\n\nPricing is pretty reasonable, especially considering the pours were pretty large for the flights.

Oh if you are a tourist, this is an oasis between the Burger King and the let's say not so tourist friendly surroundings.\n\nThey have a selection of craft beers that are really prevalent in my current hometown, San Diego.  Although it can't compete with craft beer selection in SD, you can't actually fault them, they have provided a service in this area that is as mentioned, a needle in a haystack.  If you are from out of CA, it's a nice place from the hustle and bustle of Union Sq and all it's busy touristy spots.\n\nLocated across the Hotel Whitcomb (a place I have stayed at), it probably gets some of their guests and tourist who wander off the beaten path.  Foodwise, they have some nibbles but I wouldn't consider it a dining destination.  Enjoy your beer and nibbles and find another place for a full meal.

I agree. So much variety of seating for such a small, narrow space. There's room at the bar, tall tables for two along the side, and group seating at the front and back. Luckily we were able to squeeze near the bar.\n\nSeeing all the heavy dinner food that everyone was enjoying made me realize that we should have come here for our pre-musical meal instead of a separate restaurant, but the beer selection alone is impressive.

What a great find for good local beer and light bites. I'll agree with the other reviews on the duck tacos - excellent. The Charcuterie was a bit disappointing compared to many other places I've visited that offer the same. I'd recommend that they expand to a few different Charcuterie offers with other variety of meats. But I will definitely go back. Like most places, they will let you sample some of the beer before you select and the guys behind the bar had great  info about the selections. It was fun to \"pop quiz\" one of the guys and ask what 4 beers would he take in a flight if he had to pick. Small, comfortable, like a neighborhood bar but with the tasting room vibe.", "author": "Rick S."}
