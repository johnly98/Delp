The current 6 bison, however, do not descend from the original herd and are instead a newer generation of chill, laid-back females, as males tend to get a bit randy during mating season.

The grass was tall and dying.  So the bison all lying down in the tall grass blended as if they were in the plains of South Dakota.

Living in North Dakota I had a bison farm walking distance from my dorm room so it was an everyday occurrence.  Living in Reno I have a bison farm about two miles from my house as I live on the edge of the city.

This is an amazing beautiful part of the park that seems overlooked by those wandering around the massive expanse in the middle of the city. \n\nWe parked across the street from the placard outside the paddock, which is the only indication that anything is behind the fence as all of the bison were in one of the back pens. We walked along a sand path that ran alongside the fence and after a short distance, started to make out the outline of the massive beasts among the grass. We were among three other people, all of whom were in the same group, and were pressing their phones against the chain link fence trying to get the best picture of the bison. One kid tried to scale the fence and was met with a slap from good ol' gravity. Not too surprising, the bison were not bothered at all by the human presence although there was quite a distance between the outer fence and where they were located.\n\nOn our way back to the car, the husband decided to walk along the opposite end of the paddock from whence we came. Mistake! The other path was significantly longer as it stretched along the back and side of the paddock which is quite massive- so they are not pinned in a small enclosure as they would be in a zoo. We were walking the dogs who became increasingly exhausted and I ended up carrying our little one back to the car. On our long loop back to the car, we passed by a dog park and public restrooms so if you are in need of either, turning right at the paddock is the direction for you. Make sure you wear appropriate shoes- you will get dirty between the dirt and sand from the trail and if you take the long way back to your car, comfortable shoes are a must!

And Bison!\n\nActually, the Bison are a great, if bizarre addition to the park. They don't do much, but that doesn't make them less interesting. And of course, they are certainly less happy than living in Yellowstone National Park, where they are more or less an indigenous species, acclimated to the climate and seasonal cycles. But that doesn't make them any less an asset to Golden Gate Park. \n\nI must say that some of the previous reviewers might want to bone up on their American history. They weren't actually hunted for fur or meat, at least once the \"Manifest Destiny\" took hold. They were in fact slaughtered by mercenaries hired by the railroads in order to deprive Native Americans of one of their cherished sources of food and sustenance (not to mention spiritual icons). Shot from trains and stagecoaches as the European settlers expanded westward, they were left to rot all over the great plains by the tens of thousands. Basically as a resolute \"F-You\" to the tribal people that depended upon them.\n\nAnd now we pump water from the dwindling aquifers to water crops that could never grow in the high plains to feed to cows who can't actually eat the crops, but are much easier to domesticate than Bison, even though Bison meat is far healthier than much of the Cattle Beef Americans consume. Furthermore, the Bison (having survived on the Great Plains for millenia) migrated constantly and never consumed the rhizomes (thus destroying the root of the grasses), thus ensuring a healthy high plains ecosystem. Unlike grass-fed beef, the historical record of these enormous migrations are a testament to the magnificence of the American west that has nearly been subsumed by the homogenizing influence of Ag giants like Monsanto and ADM.", "author": "Damien S."}

We spent fifteen minutes looking for a herd of wild bison grazing through the green grasses of Golden Gate Park only to be left disappointed at the sight of ONE camouflaged miserable bison, inactively laying up against a metal fence in a confined yellow grass section. I think my visit would have been more satisfying if there was a herd of bison actively wandering the park that weren't restricted to such a boring confined area. I felt really bad for that one bison. He didn't even have any friends to mingle with or join him in his misery. We didn't even get to enjoy the fresh smell of stinky bison let alone get a glimpse of a humongo heap of buffalo poop like you do when you visit the zoo. They might as well ship this little fellow off to the San Francisco zoo where he won't have to look like the only miserable caged animal.", "author": "Ally C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-03-22", "description": "Apparently when I was a baby, I cried a lot.  What can I say, I already knew what the world had in store for me.  The only way to calm me down was either to beat me into submission* or drive me to see the bison in Golden Gate Park.  My dad told me that the buffalo were actually in Wyoming but he happened to know an excellent short cut to get from San Francisco to Yellowstone in 15 minutes.  Essentially, from what my 5 year-old self understood, we were going on a cross country road trip.  I seriously believed the man until I was 8 years-old at which time I got into a fight with Marc Fransen about the location of said Bison and when I was proven wrong, I bloodied his face.  I never cared much for facts, I just like to be right.  Anyway,  the whole thing was fucked up.   To this day, I have a totally distorted grasp on geography and if you ask me where Michigan is, I'll point to Seattle.  Thanks, Dad!   I wonder if it's any coincidence that this was around the same time that seeing the bison in that small, crappy enclosure started to make me sad.  \n\n*Thank god my parents have been afraid of the law since their run in with the IRS in '82.  The one time my dad tried to spank me, i ended up screaming, \"I WILL CALL CPS!  I WILL CALL CPS!\" even though i had no idea what it meant other than some parents at my school were in big ol' trouble with them and anyway.  My dad ended up just sending me to my room and when i asked him about this years later, he said that he and my mom laughed at me for like an hour because i was so g-d dramatic.  Whatevs, I totally would have called CPS even if I thought it meant \"Candyland Patrol Services\".    Man, thinking back.  My parents let me get away with waaaay too much shit.  I should totally be a serial killer or something.  Oh well, they have my brother for that. \n\nTwo informative bits about the GG Bison Heard and awesome Buffalo in general: \n\n1) In 1908, a train that was carrying a carload of buffaloes from Yellowstone to Golden Gate Park crashed and all of the Buffalo escaped.  Cowboys had to be engaged to coral them up and get them to San Francisco!  Crazy town, right?\n\n2) There is a small but committed group of citizens who care deeply about the safety and well being of the heard and who fight constantly for them to have improved conditions (i.e. more stumps to rub on, better quality food, more enrichment) and they are always at city hall hooting and hollering for these gorgeous creatures.  And honestly, they usually get their way.  If that doesn't show you that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can make real change, I don't know what does.  There goes your Margaret Mead bumper sticker in action, baby!  You, too, can go down and volunteer through park services, if you want.   And you should.  Maybe, for Bison, being in SF is better than being at Yellowstone where Since 2001, the State of Montana, the National Forest Service and the National Park Service have slaughtered more than thousands of wild bison as they migrate to lower elevations in winter and spring. American taxpayers fund this slaughter to the tune of $3 million a year simply because the politically influential Montana livestock industry says bison compete with cattle for grazing resources.    Yes, let's kill off the animals that were here first so that we can fatten up more cows so that Americans can get their cholesterol laden, chemical filled 3 burgers a day!  What will Junior do without his Burger King Super Meal Deal?!  Oh, that's right,  he'll live a lot longer.
