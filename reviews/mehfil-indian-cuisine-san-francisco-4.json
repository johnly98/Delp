In fact it's so popular we have an app built internally that scrapes the daily specials and returns the information back to us. I'm pretty impressed we have that kind of automation at our disposal. Also they print out daily menus for each day of the week as well. \n\nWe dropped in during a busy Dreamforce week because Ippudo was quoting a 25 minute wait. That was outright crazy and we wanted to eat without waiting. After much deliberation, we settled on Mehfil and were seated right away when we arrived.\n\nI was settled on the sizzling salmon hot platter. One thing I like about their specials is the inclusion of soup, salad, and naan. You get the most value out of it and I haven't been disappointed. I also got a mango lassi to go with my meal. Definitely get garlic naan with your meal. Back to the sizzling platter. The portion of fish was huge and we shared it family style. Also the quality of salmon was good and the fish was indeed fresh. \n\nThere were some service issues.\n1) They messed up and did not put in our second order of naan into the kitchen. \n2) We got an order of chicken tikka masala that we did not order (which we promptly sent back). \n3) We asked for a check and it took them ages to bring it over. \n\nThis is A-OK with a 3.5 stars given it's close proximity, popularity among the masses, and their dedication to the menu.", "author": "Tim G."}

But sometimes you don't feel like pigging out at a buffet nor having Indian fusion.  That's when a bowl of curry and rice hits the spot.  It's not earth shattering, but it gets the job done at a reasonable price.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala: Not bad for a $7 lunch in the FiDi/SoMa area.  They give you a ton of tikka masala sauce, so the rice almost feels like creamy risotto.  The sauce really is the best part since it's so yummy and comforting.  The chicken chunks feel a bit dry though.  I mean this is easily mitigated by the generous sauce portion, but you'll definitely notice it when you bite through a large tikka chunk.\n\nGarlic Naan: Not particularly garlicky.  Decent naan though with some parts light and crispy and other parts thick and chewy.  Probably an excessive add-on if you're getting a rice & curry bowl.", "author": "Adam B."}

But to my surprise, I had a very angry driver drop off our food banging on the closest window to my front gate. I have a doorbell and it works perfectly fine. I also have a phone number that is left with you in case you need to reach me. \n\nFirst and only thing he asked me about was a TIP since I paid through eat24 and only paid for my meal. I literally did not know who was banging at my window at 9PM at night but I didn't bring cash so I went back upstairs to get some money and didn't have any singles so I had a good amount of coins in my hand. \n\nI told him \"this is the only change I have. There's some coins in there\" I know it seemed kinda shady that I had coins in my hand but he was not happy, put his hand in my face and walked away from me talking the most shit about me and my coins.\n\nThanks for your shitty service. You definitely did not deserve the 20% tip that was only partly in quarters.", "author": "Caroline R."}

They didn't know about much of Indian spices but girl came to table to explain when they were asking to turban guy about all. She explained and gave some great guidance about North Indian food.

And it's a steal too.\n\nThe $5 and up lunchbox keeps office workers coming during the week. You can dine-in (lunchbox n/a for dine-in) but it seems most folks head right to the back and get in line for the lunchbox. Chicken tikka masala is a daily staple but I do love the fact that they rotate the rest of the menu every day for variety. Of those daily specials I like the Soia Murg - cubed chicken cooked in a dill herb curry sauce, and the self explanatory chicken asparagus curry. I often ask for more curry gravy to soak up the basmati rice. \n\nIt does feel like they've practiced some restraint on the level of heat and spice but for a quick and cheap curry lunch, especially on a rainy day, I'm glad I can run over to Mehfil between meetings.", "author": "Jon L."}

I like how customers have the option mix/match the veggie and meat dishes for the bento boxes. You may also get a side of mint chutney and tamarind sauce for no extra charge.

Good flavors overall, but the meat isn't consistently cooked well. Lunch takeout is super cheap - only $5-6!! - which is pretty much nothing compared to a lot of the lunch options around FiDi. Their takeout menu rotates daily\n\n=========================\n\n*** RECOMMEND ***\n\n-CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA - 3.5/5\nYummy! The curry is delicious, but the chicken is a little inconsistent - sometimes super tender, sometimes a little dry and sometimes very dry.\n\n-LAMB CURRY - 4/5\nPretty good, though the lamb is also inconsistent. Some pieces are tender and others are too dry and overcooked.\n\n-MEHFIL-E-MIX / MIX VEGETABLES - 5/5\nVeggies are well cooked and the sauce is very flavorful with a hint of heat\n\n-SAAG PANEER - 4/5\nPretty good and flavorful. This would be so much better if there was good naan to dip with!\n\n-SAMOSA - 4/5\nTheir samosas are pretty big. Nice and crispy on the outside without being super greasy, and full of potatoes, spices and a little heat on the inside. I wish there were more peas though to balance out all the potatoes.\n\n=========================\n\n*** PASS ***\n\n-NAAN - 2/5\nNot that good. I love naan, but their naan is doughy and undercooked. Too chewy for my liking. Honestly, the Costco naan tastes better\n\n-GARLIC NAAN - 2.5/5\nPlain naan garnished with some fresh garlic. Same as the plain naan - too doughy. The garlic at least gives it some more flavor, but I've had much, much better.\n\n-PANEER PAKORA - 1/5\n[Cottage cheese marinated in chickpea batter, spices, and herbs]\nNot really a fan of the texture. It's basically like fried cottage cheese. \n\n-CHICKEN TIKKA- 2/5\nNot that good. Chicken is too dry and lacked flavor. The chicken tikka masala is much much better\n\n-CHICKEN LACHNA - 1.5/5\n[Fried chicken strips]\nMeh. Dry strips of fried chicken. Lacking flavor.\n\n-RAITA - 1/5\n[Yogurt mixed with cucumber, mint leaves]\nHas a hint of heat in it, but way too sour", "author": "Jessie L."}

The serving area is a steam table in back. The serving dishes (round bowls) lock tight. It is $5 veggie or $6 meat with cash. Charge/Debit is a bit more.

Forgetting lunch in my car one day, I decided to check them out.\n\nLocated like a block away from the Montgomery Bart Station, you can find this restaurant. Like I said, this review is only based on the Lunch Rush Menu. Instead of sitting down and ordering, if you ask for the Lunch choices, they'll send you to the back of the restaurant at a Cafeteria style counter.\n\nThere are like 5 or so different items to choose from. All times I've went, I've only had the Chicken Tikka Masala. They fill the bottom of the to-go plastic tupperware with rice and smother the top with a couple of pieces of chicken and the Tikka Masala sauce. This alone is only $6, and you can add Naan bread for an extra $1.50/$2.00 depending on your choice of plain or garlic perspectively.\n\n***Note: There is a sur charge if you pay with card***\n\nThe chicken is cooked well and the sauce is sooooo good. It's got some spice, but it's not overwhelming. You get a good amount for the value. It's definitely good if you're in the area.

Everything seemed fine until I started eating the dish. I noticed that the texture of some of the chicken pieces seemed off - not nearly as firm as they should have been. I just assumed it may have been some fat. Then one of my colleagues made the same observation and after a careful examination, we noticed that the chicken was still raw. \n\nI returned to the restaurant with a couple pieces of the raw chicken and brought it to the attention of the staff. The lady with whom I spoke did not seem to grasp the severity of the situation and just looked at the other staff for guidance. She mentioned it to at least two other employees, yet no one took any action. In the end, she took the chicken and told me that since I had only brought a small portion, she couldn't offer any compensation. Although I wasn't seeking compensation, an establishment that is truly committed to customer service would have gladly offered another dish at no cost. At the very least, the gesture would have been appreciated. \n\nAlthough serving raw chicken is never acceptable, it was Mehfil's handling of the situation that was particularly troubling.

Let's see, it was once the Lunch Menu and then it was an Italian place called Castafiore. And oh yes, then there was the two-part South Asian period where it became Bindi, a place I liked and even received an ROTD for my review of it, and for no reason I could think of, it changed into Okra while serving basically the same food. Then for less than a nano-second, it became Cafe Med, where they had a pretty good Mediterranean buffet set-up with fresh hummus and roasted vegetables. But it closed its doors before it became a habit for me.\n\nI didn't bother reviewing this location since Bindi because by the time I was ready to write something, it changed into something else. But now Mehfil is trying to buck the odds and open their third restaurant at this location, even though their Folsom location is less than three blocks away. My friend Linda and I decided to try the new Mehfil on the second day of their operation, and it was a mixed experience for us and frankly a state of divine chaos. The staff was running around in a semi-crazed state forgetting to close out transactions and just not paying attention to the customers. Hopefully it will calm down to a more comfortable routine for them. Linda tried the $7 Tandoori Chicken Tikka Salad and felt it missed the mark considerably.\n\nThe slice of chicken tikka adraki was quite dried out despite having been marinated in yogurt. The spring mix, iceberg lettuce, cucumber, tomato, carrots and red bell peppers were reasonable enough, but she found the house-made Mehfil-E-Mango dressing indigestible. I went for the $5 vegetarian twofer of Channa Saag and Laganshala over rice (see photo). The Channa Saag is a chickpea and spinach puree which was tasty but a tad too oily for my taste, while the Laganshala is a vegetable stew of cauliflower, carrots, potatoes, and green beans seasoned with a number of spices. The latter was easily the best dish because it was the simplest. I'll probably wait a while before coming back since their opening week jitters started to get on my nerves.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...the laganshala saved the meal, the rest of it needs work\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...same weird bi-level space that makes no sense to me\nSERVICE - 2 stars...chaos is the word of the day\nTOTAL - 3 stars...barely holing onto 3 stars but I hate it to be the next in a long line of casualties at this address", "author": "Ed U."}

Personal opinion: it's awful, I don't like chains, and depending on the day, it's either Subway's pretty cousin or ugly little sister, - ain't guna cut it, especially with all the awesome sandwich shops in the Financial), so we went with Mehfil.\n\nI've been to Mehfil before, but it was in the pre-historic times when my palate was so immature and my stomach was so small; I think I actually ordered one piece of naan, and that was my lunch, not kidding. Since I've become a real human, I wanted to give it another go, and today I had a craving for Chicken Tikka Massala. And that is what I got.\n\nLunch special for this dish is $7, plus $1 for hot, charred naan which is always my favorite part of the dish. So $8, not too bad, it's cash only. My friend only had his lucky dollar, and I had $5, so the cashier let it slide and told us to come back another time and pay the rest. \n\nAlso, pretty sure they do cash only for the lunch specials because they are trying to dump old food, but I can't really complain. \n\nOR CAN I?!? The chicken in my dish was very dry and there was waaay too much rice, which was also dry. What am I supposed to do after all these carbs? Take a food-induced nap at my desk?

Just the right combination of spicy and good round flavored. The rice, was fine. The naan, was disappointing because two of my four pieces weren't fully baked and still doughy.

There's some interesting stuff here even on the lunch menu that a lot of Indian places don't have.\n\nWe both decided to do combos of one whole dish and a second half-dish (for $5.99). She got the Tandoori Salmon and Bhindi Masala, and I got the Punjabi Goat Curry and Laganshala. We also both got Zafrani Lassis, because I'd heard that was the unique thing to get here.\n\nAll of the dishes were tasty, but the salmon took the cake for most aromatic. It came on a sizzling plate and smelled wonderful--fish mixed with an array of exotic spices combined with vegetables. It was pretty delicious, though I couldn't have eaten an entire dish of it as it was quite rich. If you're not an okra fan like me, skip the Bhindi Masala. No amount of spices can cover up that slimy saliva texture. Yuck! The Goat Curry was a little spicy and very tasty, with tender pieces of goat meat. The Laganshala sounded great, but seemed kind of....bland....to me. If you are a fan of the original tart froyo flavor, you should definitely try the Zafrani Lassi, which has the same tart creaminess with a bonus of other fruity flavors and spices.\n\nDespite the fact that we had a \"sit-down\" lunch, the food came out really fast. Yet, we were allowed to enjoy at our leisure without ever feeling rush. Praises for the service are definitely warranted--the people who work here are exceptionally friendly and hospitable.", "author": "Josephine L."}

I used to go here for lunch both to eat at the buffet, order from the lunch plate area and delivery for both home and work. Since I've moved jobs now it's primarily delivery for at home but we've ordered for work lunches and the experience has been the same.\n\nLet's start with the lunch experience. You could get a quick inexpensive rice and another option for 6 to 7 bucks and you're in and out for those on the go. The other option was to grab a to go plate and you could grab from the same buffet that you could grab from if you ate there. I've done both and both are solid.\n\nDelivery. By far this place has been the best delivery restaurant of any cuisine I've ordered from. It's the only place that consistently delivers before the stated time. Most places are always late which I understand because SF is a hard city to get around, which amazes me even more that this place is further than some of the restaurants we order from and they still deliver in half the time. \n\nNow the food. It is consistently good. I've ordered a ton from here and I've yet to have a time where my wife or anyone made any comments about \"hmm this time something is off\". \n\nI have to say it makes sense. I recall the owner was the one usually at the cashier during busy lunches. He was always friendly and you could tell he made an effort to make sure people were taken care of.", "author": "Hyung L."}

We opted for the sit down experience, but I think it's more bang for your buck if you take it to go.\n\nEveryone ordered different dishes to try, including a vegetarian dish, lamb, chicken mushroom, and chicken tikka masala. All the entrees were delicious. The lamb was nice and tender, and the vegetarian dish had a nice heartiness to it. The tikka masala had delicious sauce, but the chicken mushroom's chicken was a lot more tender. The dishes came with a small serving of lentil soup, plates of \"salad\" that were cucumbers and tomatoes, naan and basmati rice. We were all pretty stuffed and satisfied after our meals. The total came out to be around $15 per person including tax and tip.\n\nI think the food here is great, but it's a bit overpriced, especially for sit down. When you takeout, you get basmati rice with your choice of curry over the rice. It's a pretty big portion for around $6-7 which I think is much more worth it.

Oh yeah!\n\nThey update their menu online every day so you can decide what you want before you even step foot inside.  Head to the back of the restaurant where you can see the piping hot food behind the counter.  I opted for the chicken cranberry, which was similar to tikka masala but with dried cranberries added.  For $6 I got a generous heap of chicken cranberry, rice, & fresh naan.  The chicken was tender & the chunks were huge!  I ended up only eating half of the naan since the portions were so large.  They also serve wraps & have a few vegetarian options.  \n\nI did notice that they charge $1 if you pay for your to go order with a credit card, so be sure to bring cash.

My wife is big on Indian food and using her ways of subtle and constant manipulation she was able to get me to go to Dosa. I have a whole separate review on Dosa but that re-experience of Indian food changed my outlook towards the cuisine itself. Maybe my palate matured or maybe it just took me that long to get over the very last experience that floored me for a couple days.\n \nMehfil is completely different from Dosa. It's a good experience and probably one of the better values in the Financial. They have a menu that is constantly updated. All the food comes hot and fresh. They provide everyone with a small cup of tasty lentil soup and a starter salad to be shared by the table. They also bring out naan for the table to use for scooping up the delicious sauces. I've had their tandoori chicken and prawns and both are excellent. Their masalas are also excellent. It's tasty and affordable. It's best to get in before 11:30 on a normal day.

I have come here a few times for the sit-down meal, and you really need to arrive at 11:30 or earlier for a decent experience. If you come a little before noon you'll have to wait forever to order and then chase the waiter when he deserts your table. We even had to walk up to the service counter to pay because we could not catch anyone's eye to request the tab. \n\nAs an alternative, I recommend the cheap take-out meals. Besides not needing to wait for attention, you might get the one guy who smiles and greets you. I have learned to request extra sauce. Avoid the tikka chicken, which tends to be very dry. The chai (at $1.95) and naan are delicious!\n\nI predict that if they can train their staff to be friendly (e.g., a smile and eye contact, attentiveness) it will improve their Yelp scores and chances of staying open. They should even have the staff in photos on their website smiling instead of looking vaguely displeased.

Now here is where it goes all downhill. We asked to make the dishes SPICY. It was bland as hell. We called them, asked them to make it SPICY as requested. The person went back, got a bowl of red chilly powder, placed it on the table and left. We were shocked. Any how, we called them again that we asked to make it spicy not just hand over some red chilly powder to be sprinkled to the dish. They apologized again and went back. This time the gravy came back and guess what, instead of trying to make it a spicy gravy, they just sprinkled the red chilly powder and stirred it and got it back, even without re heating so that it mixes well.\n\nThat was the time we were regretting our decision of coming there.

Yes. I can't explain it).\nAnyway I was not expecting much to say the least. I had never heard of it, a Subway was next door and I seriously considered it, but I've eaten at least a thousand Subway subs and after enough they get to be, well, just gross. \nSo, enter Mehfil. I walked in, was promptly seated and after looking over their definitely expansive menu decided on my default Indian oder of Chicken Tikka Masala and naan. I opted for the butter naan instead of garlic naan because garlic naan and I don't always agree. Shortly after ordering I was presented with a nice dish of the masala, rice (which I didn't order but was provided all the same) and piping hot butter naan. \nLet me tell you, I've had a lot of curreis and chicken tikka masala in my day. I'm reluctant to claim \"best\" anywhere but this was damn good. Perfectly spiced. By that I mean it was spicy but not overly so. There were none of those annoying pieces of something that are always in masalas that are authentic. Sorry, I don't know what they're called, but I have to spit them out every time. They taste like licorice and baby diapers and they absolutely ruin every dish in other establishments. Not here. Here the masala is pure, free of all the annoying extras including bay leaves which they must use but filter out before serving, and lo - this is the real deal.\nI surprise myself even now, writing this. I consider myself to be a fairly renowned snob when it comes to Indian. I've been to London and had some of the best, have been a Shalimar fan for 20 years, go to Amber India on a regular basis, and try as many of the new decent places like Kasa as I can.

My tandoori chicken was delish... i haven't had a place mess up tandoori chicken yet. All of the food was actually really good! For drinks we ordered different types of lassi: mango, salt, and a spice one. The consistency was off for the spice one.. there were big chunks of ice in it.. not blended well. The mango lassi was just ok.. the consistency wasn't as thick as i've had it else where, but it tasted ok. I didn't try the salt lassi.\n\nI must say I am disappointed with their service. Our main dishes came out prompt but the naan and rice took forever to come out, we even had to ask for it.

The service isn't that great but what brings me back here is the $6 lunch plate that's pretty filling, there's hardly ever a long wait and it's across the street from my building.  The tikka masala sauce is almost consistent but sometimes it's way too spicy.  For the chicken, I don't think it's cooked with the sauce but grilled and then added after the sauce has been cooked because sometimes the meat is a little tough and dry.  I don't like that they keep their nann wrapped in foil in a water cooler so the bread isn't crispy anymore and you don't even know when it was made.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-17", "description": "There's a saying in the restaurant business: people go for the food and come back for the hospitality. One thing is certain: Mehfil is a MEH FAIL. I'll never return to any of their restaurants. I recommend that you never visit. \n\nThis review is for my visit to Mehfil on Second St in San Francisco with a friend on 3 October 2012 from 12:20 noon until 1:40 PM. \n\nI enjoy Indian cuisine. Truly, I do. Today, I did not. My friend and I enjoyed two delicious dishes: a chicken curry and a lamb kebab. Their sauces were sinfully rich and seductively savory. Included with a la carte dine-in are a salad, lentil soup, rice and naan. The lentil soup was littered with pepper, which was fine for me, but would likely not be great for others. The cucumber and tomato salad felt like a wilted afterthought scooped from a batch that was prepped days prior. The rice wasn't memorable, but it was mandatory. \n\nThe naan... Everyone loves naan. If you don't love naan, something is wrong with you. Naan is the deliciousness that epitomizes Indian cuisine. A well defined Indian staple, naan is more necessary than rice. \n\nI like eating my Indian dishes with naan more than rice. I'd tear pieces of naan and dip them in the sauce, or I'd wrap pieces of meat with naan. It was delicious. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who enjoys their Indian food with naan instead of rice. \n\n I typically need more than one naan, so when I asked for a couple, I was surprised that there was a long delay in its delivery. The menu indicated that naan was included with a la carte dine-in service, so naan should be made available at the request of customers if they need more. \n\nWhen heavenly, buttery, savory, seductively dipped naan is treated as a dish that cannot be provided to the client after he requests it multiple times but it was delivered without haste and as if it wasn't deserved... when a waitress condescendingly demonizes visitors who enjoy naan more than life itself... it's impossible to enjoy Indian cuisine. \n\nI received the final check, and the bill indicated an extra charge for naan. I was confused because naan was included with a la cart dine-in service. I mentioned this to the waitress, and she made me feel like an idiot. She said the naan was limited per customer and not \"unlimited\". She said the printed menu indicated this, but it actually does not. The manager's attention was called, but he stood back and peered at our table with no apology for the misunderstanding. The extra naan charge was only a couple dollars, but the waitress and manager's handling of the situation oozed a condescending tone. They were unbelievably rude and suggested that I shouldn't return if I couldn't afford the extra naan charge. I couldn't believe how belittled I felt. I couldn't believe how stupid they both made me feel. \n\nNaan used to make me happy. Mehfil's stingy, selfish, and elitist staff has ruined my love for naan.", "author": "Travel Swagger R."}

The food does not disappoint, though! Their mango chutney is delicious. I also think they have the best Chicken Tikka Masala in San Francisco. I am also a huge fan of their samosas and garlic naan. They also offer delivery on Eat 24 so if you want some delicious indian food brought to your door, don't hesitate to order Mehfil!", "author": "Shali N."}

They apologised and I reordered today for dinner for about 10 people. They were quick and efficient. (He told us it would take 45-60 minutes and it was delivered in 30). The food was excellent quality and hot. Will definitely be back for more. Appreciate them owning up and solving my problem. Kudos to this restaurant.", "author": "Rushi S."}

The curry is not watered down and they are generous with the meat. Only down side is that it is cash only. The portion size is good. It definitely filled me up and gave me food coma after so I would imagine it to be pretty satisfying for a guy too. Check it out!

I live close by and for convenience I have ordered here a number of times (more than 10). After ordering a number of times I started to notice that the $ total for my order seemed to vary wildly even though I was often ordering the same things. I found this strange and started to pay close attention. To my surprise I noticed that they were frequently charging me for more expensive dishes than I had actually ordered.\n\nThe first time I noticed this I confronted the cashier who told me the charge was correct, when I picked up the menu to show him his error he looked like a kid caught stealing a cookie and didn't really even try to pretend it was unintentional.\n\nThe next time I ordered from the mehfil I was working late and my girlfriend picked up the food. When I checked to see what she had paid I was furious to notice that they had overcharged her.\n\nThe last (ever) time I ordered here I was again working late and wanted to pick up on the way home. I ordered the following 2 menu items totaling $23 dollars and when I got there to pick up the bill they presented me was $37.\n\nThese are people are not honest and will look to take advantage of you any time they think you are not paying close attention. \n\nLook elsewhere.", "author": "J W."}

After I was half way through my main course, I wondered why the lentil soup and salad had never arrived. When I inquired, the waitress said \"we ran out\"  They offered a sweet beverage as a substitute which I could not accept being a diabetic. After I finished my 2 item rather than 5 item lunch, they wanted to present me with the bill. I told the manager of my experience, but he should have known, because he was less than 8 feet away from my table. He agreed to comp me. I should have been informed from the beginning if they had run out of things. Seems the priority here is to turn the tables quickly and keep the register ringing.", "author": "blaine s."}

Janky heffas working here must all be related to the owner and feel untouchable. Wow! Went here for a business lunch and was given a lunch specials menu, and a regular lunch menu. I wanted matar paneer, which I've had here several times and its always been good. The waitress was like are you sure we offer that? B, you asking me? uh uh..rude.\nThen I tell her yes, I've had it many times before. Unless you took it off the menu, it should be there. No, sorry, we don't have that. OK!\nSo I order the Tandoori fish lunch special. They bring one tiny salad for 2 to share, and we both ordered lunch specials. There is no naan....apparently they think we should be cutting carbs and we didn't know it. I asked for some tamarind chutney on the side and after 20 minutes, had to go up and ask for it. Lots of dirty looks from the waitresses too. The food was good and I will most likely order to go again, but damn gina, get an attitude adjustment please.", "author": "Royal S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-07", "description": "Given the diversity, variety and flavor of Indian food in San Francisco, I can only feel disappointed with the food at Mehfil. My colleagues and I came here for lunch a couple of days ago and ordered the lunch special - which consists of an entree, basmati rice, naan, cucumber salad and a small cup of lentil soup. They change their entree menu every day, which is pretty cool. But in order to do that, they only offer a limited number of choices (7-8 if I'm not mistaken). They've done a good job to make these dishes diverse - a chicken dish, a lamb dish, a fish dish, a prawn dish, a kabab etc etc...Nice for meat eaters, but sucks for vegetarians, since you get only 1-2 choices. Add to that misery, the food was pretty bland, lacks spice and salt. The only plus points for me were the ambiance, service and the freshly baked naan. If the vegetarian entrees were tastier, I would visit this place more often.", "author": "Srivatsan S."}

We went to this restaurant thinking they would have really good food turns out that they do not know what they are doing.we ordered a shish kebab and it was taking too long to prepare and we suggested to cancel the order so we could leave on time then they told us that they would give it to us complementary and it would be ready in the next couple minutes but they did not tell us that they would serve it to us raw and uncooked. When we got the order and we told them that it was uncooked they simply told us yes it is complimentary and that the cook made it in a rush. I think this is very unacceptable and also the fact for us paying $61 and being treated like this.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-12-15", "description": "Service here is the worst I have ever experienced... ever, period. And it affects not just your mood and spoils the meal or occasion but affects your food as well. For example, I had to wait 5 minutes before I could get hold of a waiter/server to complain that the chicken pieces in my dish were uncooked and even after that he just said \"oh, is it so,\" and disappeared for ever. I kept all the uncooked chicken pieces on the side in a plate to show them how much of it was raw but they did not care at all and still charged me the full price of the dish without even asking if I wanted a replacement or another dish. They just do not have time during the day to take care of the number of people that come in. And more importantly - they just don't care. In another instance they brought my wife's order a full 15 minute after they served the other two people at the same table. Think of her waiting and seeing others eat their food while she waits for her order (that was from their lunch menu so it did not need any preparation, they just had to get it from the counter). Having said all of this, I think a good value is to take out their lunch box whenever they have chicken tikka masala. That way you get to enjoy one dish that they are good at and not deal with their service.", "author": "Rasesh K."}

Perhaps I should have paid more attention to the fact that most reviewers were raving about the economical lunch specials.\n   Dinner at the Fillmore location was, in a word, awful.\n   First up, service. Our waiter seemed horribly chagrined that we didn't order alcohol. And he took our order with a table-wiping rag in hand. He utilized that rag, or a broom, for the entire time we were there. Much sweeping, much wiping, the drink dismay, then got our order wrong.\n   The food itself---veg samosas, shrimp with mango, mixed veg in ginger/garlic sauce, garlic naan---were all tasteless and heavy. But HOT! Is was as if cayenne were the only seasoning used. \n   Addendum: the garlic naan wasn't hot, just dry and tasteless.\n   In decades of enjoying Indian food in many cities and countries, I think this may be the worst I've ever encountered. \n   Next time, we'll spring for the $$$ and enjoy the excellent food at lovely DOSA down Fillmore at Geary.", "author": "Sarah S."}
