However, their food and service are getting worse so I stopped eating here.  Over the weekend my wife and I just happened to be in the area so we decided to give it a try.  The food was okay but the waitress is still pretty unprofessional with the way she dealt with customers (to be fair, the second waitress seems to be okay with her interaction with other customers).  \n\nToday I received my credit bill and noticed that they added $1 to the actual total amount.  At first I thought it was an honest mistake so I was going to let it go.  But then I realized that I had the same experience about 8 months ago at this restaurant where they added $0.50 to the total amount (after 15% tip).  I always keep my credit card receipts so I can verify all my charges from the statement.  If this happened to me twice, I am sure they must have done the same to other customers.  Even though it is a waste of my time for $1 dispute, I decided to call my credit card to report it.", "author": "David D."}

You are seated and given a sheet to fill out for dim sum items which is the usual for a lot of dim sum places. If you have questions about menu be prepared to ruin someone's day as asking about anything seems to be a burden to the staff/management.   \n\nMost of the items are pretty basic with a little variation for stuff like shrimp dumplings etc. Everything we ordered was good but the wait time for each items was a bit long. \n\nWe were a group of 4 persons and ran the bill up to about $60, we were adventurous and tried a lot of the menu. Over all we agreed that we would rather go to any of the many Dim Sum places in SF as the overall experience here was unwelcoming and lack luster. \n\nNotes:\n\n-Food here is good\n-Best if you can speak/read Chinese\n-Parking can be a bit tough (Residential, or parking meters)\n-Overall clean \n-Service is like stepping on toes\n-Food comes out a bit slow\n\nAs with a 2 star rating per Yelp \"Meh.

Some of it is really good.\n\nThat being said, for the reasons stated below in many other reviews, I *only* come here when I'm with my Chinese best friend. There are a lot of Chinese people eating here, you will notice, so obviously the food is at least decent (I really love the fried chicken and get it every time...it's seasoned well and crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside). I have noticed that, as others have mentioned, I do get stared at by the Chinese patrons when we're there (I'm not Chinese) but that's fine. We've had many lunches here together and come away full for less than $25 every time.\n\nI would never come here without her! Now that she doesn't live a block away, I haven't come in quite a while. And judging by the reviews below, I know that I probably won't patronize this place again for a long time. It's really sad that they treat their customers this way.

Pot stickers totally mushy on the inside - not good.  The servers and the hostess seemed all to be very unhappy to be there.

We were super hungry after wandering around Clement and decided to stop in for some quick dim sum. Immediately we were stared at by the staff and other customers in the restaurant which continued through our entire meal. We were given two menus for three people and asked about the dim sum menu when we saw the waitress again 15 minutes later. She brought over a menu with prices crossed out in pencil and rewritten as more expensive, looks like certain customers get cheaper prices here. A different waitress brought a plate of wakame and showed us saying you like seaweed? We looked at the plate and said we didn't order that and didn't want it.\n\nAfter about 30 minutes we finally flagged the waitress down as she was coming out of the kitchen with another table's free chicken feet that seemed to be given to every table except ours. We ordered and 15 minutes later they told me sister they didn't have chow fun, so she would need to get chow mein. Mid bite into the chow mein we found a metal thread! It was sharp and most likely from a wire dish scrubbing brush. We told the waitress and she said oh its probably from the dishes. The dumplings were okay, the sesame balls were the best part of the meal but due to the bad service we will never be back and I hope the health department will sort this place out.", "author": "Lisa H."}

They may charge you more by manually changing the prices on the dim sum menu to be $1.00 higher than the list price.  Other customers that understand Chinese may get their printed listed price, no scratching off the prices on the menu.  Look around at other tables to see if they got the same prices.  This is how I caught them.  When I confronted the cashier, she got defensive that I have another table's menu with the list price and said the price on our menu was for dinner...then why do you give me the dinner price when I was there at 12:30pm for lunch?\n\nAfter sharing our experience to other family members, they too almost got ripped off until they confronted the cashier as to why the bill was so much higher.  If you eat there, be sure to get an itemized bill that shows the items ordered so that you can reconcile the charge to what you ordered, otherwise they will overcharge you.\n\nI will not be going back to this place.  If you want dim sum and don't need to sit down to eat it, there are other dim sum take-out stores on Clement between 6th & 8th Avenue that is only around $2.10 per order vs $2.80 (list price) or $3.80 (the claimed dinner price or ripping people off).\n\nIt's a shame that these people are dishonest.", "author": "Clem Y."}

Initially, we were heading towards Hong Kong Lounge but after seeing the line, we decided to go elsewhere. And that's how we were brought here. I actually just found this place by mistake. \n\nI was lured in by the shorter line & pricing. We waited a few minutes to be seated. I was so surprised to see that the dishes were so cheap! From $2.50-$3.25!!! Specialty dishes were priced at $5.50...but not bad.\n\nThe restaurant was packed! So I was assuming it was good. So we marked on the little paper provided ehat we wanted and gave it to the waitress. \n\nService:\n\nIt's really not the best. They sorta ignore you and have to wave them down for something. I had to ask 3 times for my water to come. The guy was pretty attentive though when clearing our dishes. But we waited 20-25mins for our food to come out. Idk if it was because it was a holiday?\n\nFood:\n\n* Siumai: Standard. A little smaller than usual but served hot. Also it was pretty moist. \n* Har Gow: Good size. The skin was a little sticky but othereise delicious. \n* Chicken Feet (NOT PICTURED): Was tender yet had an overpowering anise flavor. But not bad for the price.\n* Shrimp and Chive: Delicious filling but the wrapper was also sticky. We finished it though.\n* Fried Shrimp Dumpling: A little greasy. But otherwise standard.\n* Steamed Spareribs: I've had better. But it cured my craving.\n* Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf (NOT PICTURED): Lots of filling. Served hot.\n* Steamed Tofu Roll (NOT PICTURED): Kept falling apart. Not too much flavor.\n* Fried Sesame Ball  (NOT PICTURED): Good but a little softer than I'm used to. A little greasy as well.\n* Fried Shrimp Roll (NOT PICTURED): Ehh. Greasy. Slightly burnt.\n* Foil Wrapped Chicken: I guess I'm not a big fan of five-spice. The chicken was moist though.\n\nOverall I would come back if I was in the area and Hong Kong Lounge had a long line again. Not the best dim sum in the world but it also depends on what you order.

For starters , we asked for the dim sum menu and saw our waitress( with pencil ) changing the pricing up fifty cents per item. We were a little annoyed at that but hey, it was only 50 cents and we were seated and craving dim sum. \nThe food was just mediocre. We asked the waitress which item was which, no response on each round of food. Just to add we were one of three tables in the whole restaurant.\nHere's the real disappointment. Our bill made no sense.  Scribbles ( with pencil ) of a mystery number x 5 equals 17? I asked her to clarify because our bill seemed extremely high for what we ordered , and no even number without change equals 17 when multiplied by 5. Instead of explaining she grabbed the bill and came back with a new one almost 20 dollars cheaper ! Guess we caught her adding in a tip or something( it was just a party of 2). We thought it was off when she dropped off the check she stood next to the table trying to rush us to take out money although we were still eating. \nNow this is the REAL kicker that is posted in several reviews I should have read. She ran each of our cards for an even $30. I asked my dining companion was the bill an even $60? The waitress took the itemized bill away which I asked to see again to realize she rounded up to an even number. I told her it wasn't an agrees upon price, I handed her my card for the amount of the bill. She rolled her eyes , and threw some change on my table.

The $5.25 one is usually the one that only some people find tasty, so you don't really have to worry. The thing to go with here is definitely the steamed churng fun (I prefer either the shrimp, meat, or fish fillet one... Wasn't too crazy about the bbq) The churng fun can have more stuffing in them, but the noodles are nice are soft, fresh in my opinion compared to some other dim sum places! Aside from the churng funs, go with anything shrimp. I usually don't like the ha gao, BUT for some reason theirs taste good!! I think it's because they actually de-vein (poop) the shrimp so it doesn't feel as yeucky. Their shrimps are nice and crunchy. They also have a deal with their lobster sauce noodles which was decent and flavorful for the 10-15 bucks they charge you. Their lobster tastes fresh and its meat is sweet! \n\nI'm not a huge fan of their steamed chicken feet (even though it's my all time favorite at any dim sums), but it just doesn't taste as fresh and their sauce/ marinate is meh. \n\nThis place isn't the hoo ha of all dim sums, but it's good.

After reading many reviews online I was curious to see if it was good like some raved about, or just soso like many others have said.\n\nUpon arrival on a weekday day, I was quite surprised how packed it was.  The entire restaurant was full (including the back room near the garden).  The clientele was about 90% Chinese which was a good sign, and there was even a line.\n\nWe were seated rather quickly though, in about 5 minutes as there were 2 groups of 2 in front of us.  \n\nThe ambiance was quite nice.  I do like the decor and if you can sit by the garden in the back it's more bright and somewhat airy.  The restaurant at lunch as a lively and bustling feel, and probably is a bit more noisy than quiet.  But to me that was a plus as it gave it a \"happening\" feel.\n\nAs for food.  Many reviewers have said it's just \"good\" and I'll have to agree.  The food came out rather slow, and the taste/freshness was just a good (maybe 3.5 on scale of 5).  The one good thing about the food is it is hot, so it does seem to come straight from the kitchen.\n\nService was fast, and I know many have complained about poor service but to be honest we found the service speedy and attentive.  If you need something simply call the wait staff, as they are quite busy when it's during lunch time.  Some of the wait staff didn't have fluent English, but wasn't a problem for us as we spoke Chinese with them.\n\nLastly there were complaints about bathrooms being nasty.  I think it's a bit overblown.  Surely it's not super clean like you'd find in a 5 star restaurant, but no worse than a typical Chinese restaurant.", "author": "Andrew Y."}

We did take out and we also ate in.  \n\nTake out:  We ordered Peking pork chop, tofu sole hot pot, green beans and green onion chicken. That qualified us for free delivery.  \n\nDelivery was fast and food came out hot.  Food was pretty good.  Portions are a bit on the small side.  Would do take out again.\n\nEat in Dinner:  After testing out their dinner food, I made reservations for a table in the patio room for a family dinner.  This was an early dinner (5:30).  The hostess the reservation wasn't a problem.  \n\nHowever, when we got there, they told us that a bunch of people (who's been eating since 2 PM!?!?) is still squatting on our reserved table.  They did not have the heart or were gutless to kick these losers out of our table.  Upon inspection, those people weren't even eating.  They were squatting at the table chit chatting (how to ya like that?).  \n\nThe other tables in the patio room were reserved for other people at 7 (huh, we came at 5:30, how come we can't have one of those?  We're super fast eaters!) so they didn't want to offer those tables to us.  The waiter offered the ones in the front room but my folks complained about the room being drafty (it is cold w/ the door opening and closing).  \n\nFinally, they made a makeshift table of 10 for us in the hallway connecting the front room to the patio room (the hallway were tables of 4 are located).  Unfortunately, that meant we were squeezed together in the table cuz one side of the table is flushed against a wall (so no on can sit there!).  They also gave us a bum lazy susan that literally moves across the table when you spin it!.\n\nReally for all our discomfort and inconvenience (remember, we had a reservation!), you'd think they'd give us a discount or throw in some free food. Nada.  We got zilch!  They just apologized and said we'll make it up to you next time.  Really, I don't know how you're gonna make it up to us since there's no documentation of what ya did and you didn't promise a free dish or anything like that!\n\nFood was ok but on the small portioned side.\n\nOh yeah, we finished and left before that 7:00 PM reservation for the remaining patio room tables arrived.  So ya see, we would have vamoosed it before anyone showed up.  We have some consideration!\n\nThose damn squatters on our reserved table were still sitting around and NOT EATING by the time we left.\n\nBased on the poor dinner service, I'm deducting a star (I'm being generous too!).  Come here for the dim sum.  Don't come here for dinner.\n\n*********************************\n\nI heard about this new restaurant via Chowhound so I decided to take the parents for lunch here.  This is a little bit off Clement St (a couple of  blocks past Park Presidio to be exact, between 19th & 20th Avenue).\n\nRestaurant is very spacious and clean.  They sat us in the back, indoor patio section.  There's a real nice koi filled fountain beyond the patio that you can go out and look at the Koi.  Several of the patrons actually went out and got a smoke there.\n\nThere are no carts.  Service is given via a check list.  I prefer this because the food comes out hot.  Dim sum is excellent.  My folks raved about how the Chicken Feet were the best they've had in a long time.  That's saying something cuz they always complained about the chicken feet.\n\nWe also ordered a plate of vegetarian chow mein.  That was pretty yummy too.\n\nThe food was done just right.  Not too salty.\n\nService was excellent.  The staff checked back to see how you were doing and you were profusely thanked on your way out the door.\n\nDim sum prices $2-$4.50.  Pretty reasonable considering the Banquet costs a bit more and food is mediocre at best.\n\nThis isn't just a dim sum house because they serve dinner too.  Based on the menu, I'd say the prices are pretty good.  Gotta go back to eat dinner here one of these days.\n\nParking is the only thing that sucks.  It's very difficult to find parking although I noticed they had the front of their restaurant marked off for customers so I guess if you have a big party, they'd save you 2 spots.\n\nGo ahead, check it out.

I guess not because we were ignored for ten minutes (I even got to get into a long discussion about anatomy) while sitting on the chairs for waiting and then they made us feel stupid and made a gesture and face that indicated we were stupid for not knowing we just go in and sit. I realize it was a mistake on my end but they could have handled it better because there's a fucking sign that says WAIT TO BE SEATED. Secondly, I don't know what we did to piss the waiters off but they were rude right off the bat. When giving us our food the waiter simply and literally just propped the plates on the table almost in an aggressive manner (the plates made a loud clank when he just dropped the food and utensils on the glass surface) looking flustered walking away angrily. I felt so hurt! haha, We wait a while, then 2 big groups of people came in. Our waiter was so nice to the chinese group that walked in, definitely looked happier than with us and was clearly giving them way nicer treatment, I guess just because they can speak chinese or something like that, a cultural habit that's inevitable I guess. The other table was a bunch of kids that looked like Lowell High students looking for a bite to eat after studying for hours on end. I turn around and even though our waiter took good care of the chinese group next to us the hs kid group remained unattended. I heard them complaining saying how ridiculous the wait to order was. (On a very UNIMPORTANT, DON'T EVEN BOTHER READING side note, f*** that group of HS elite overachievers, they were mocking my pre med books and saying shit like \"ohhhh big deal anyone can learn anatomy\"SMHSMHSMH) \n\nThe food is the only reason I didn't give them just one star. We had:\n\nHoney Walnut Prawns (tasted good, yet standard...you can get $5.00 same quality at this chinese restaurant on union) \nDuck (mmm, so succulent, really good, duck is always fantastic)\nSauteed Tofu with black mushroom (for you filipinas, the tofu tasted like TAHO! not a good thing this was probably the worst tofu dish I've ever had. I was so frustrated because tofu dishes never disappoint ever, how do you fcuk up tofu!??! The sauce was bland and if you closed your eyes you wouldn't be able to tell if you were eating mushroom or tofu, maybe the black mushroom was made out of tofu.) \nThai Ice Tea (tasted like chocolate [: ) \n\nI guess I liked that the menu was 5 pages of everything you could ever want at a chinese restaurant, it took like 10 minutes looking at everything trying to decide because it all looked so good, the descriptions and pictures did anyway, definitely doesn't apply to the actual piping hot plate you get :p\n\n$40.00 for two people and three items and rice. WHAAAATAHELL, AND IT WASN'T EVEN GOOD. Everything we had could have been a $20.00 meal at an EVEN BETTER neighboring chinese restaurant I imagine, I mean S.F. is adorned with them, in fact I bet I would have, no wait, I HAVE HAD better at the $1 an item Chinese restaurant on 24th and mission.

It's only been open about 6 weeks, and they have a good system. Very friendly and prompt service, and the REAL thing in dim sum, and fresh seafood swimming around in tanks.  Inexpensive too, $2.00, $2.50, $3.00 dishes in equal amounts, and \"House Special\" plates for $4.50.  I loved the ordering system with a duplicate copy paper where you mark off your favs, and the kitchen gets a copy to fill your order with very fresh, piping hot, and flavorful dishes!  \n\nIt is also very clean and filled with Chinese speaking clientle (a good sign in my opinion!).  And the surprise is a delightful glass wall in the back looking out on a charming flower filled garden and koi pond.  The blossoms are out on the trees now, so it is extra special.

I'll explain.\n\nThe first time me and my girlfriend took out some dim sum. It was a simple \"check-off-whatever-the-hell-you-want\" menu, and we ordered a pretty good assortment of dumplings. Unfortunately, the quality of the food wasn't nearly as good as the selection. Notably the \"house\" dumplings that tasted as if they were rolled in sand before cooking. Not great food in the least. \n\nAs for explaining the rest of my negative review, it goes as follows: My girlfriend's family decided to take out from here for dinner one day. Her dad (who is a black man) walked inside first to check if they were still open. Immediately they responded with a \"No, sorry.\" As he turned around to begin leaving, her mom (who is a Japanese woman) walks in and wonders if they're still open as well.  I guess they must have spotted her, because they instantly respond, \"Yes we're open!\" or something to that extent. Not surprisingly, her family realizes what's going on and promptly leaves. \n\nOf course, I'm not particularly surprised at them for being racist (they are Chinese after all). It's kind of ingrained into the immigrant generation's culture. Being fourth generation Chinese, though, I still find it rather disheartening to see that kind of discrimination going on even at a freakin dim sum restaurant. I know there's usually a sign that claims you can refuse service to anyone, but come on now. I'm sure you're capable of more class than that.", "author": "Joey Y."}

In recent visits, the service has been getting slower and worse each time and the employee's bad attitudes are coming across like they don't have to try to please the guests.  I stopped ordering the stuffed eggplant dish among others due to the fact that it was soaking in so much oil you could have fried several noodle dishes in it.

I took our things from the table including her purse and went outside to wait not realizing I hadn't left them a small tip for our $20 meal. They questioned my wife about not leaving a tip when she came out from the ladies room but of course she had no idea about it. Then the cashier lady came running outside asking about why they didn't get any tip. Well, it was an oversight but after that kind of behavior, they not only didn't get a tip from me but they have now LOST all of my future business!

I don't remember much about the prices because I was invited to go here. Let's just say, if you're really desperate for Dim Sum, go here, but you could find better elsewhere.", "author": "Alex Y."}

The last time we visited (I think it was November 2009) the broccoli was old and kind of tough.   I like their dim sum.  We do not find the dumplings greasy and the dim sum we order is seasoned just right (not too salty).  We did order a dumpling last time that seemed to have been fried but it was delicious.  Since our diet requires we stay away from too much salt or oil, we avoid Chinese restaurants where every dish seem to contain a fried ingredient.  We know which foods we can eat and this restaurant offers a good selection for us to chose from. \n\nLo mein my son ordered was very good.  It did seem to have more oil and probably high sodium content.\n\nParking can be difficult in this neighborhood and that might be a problem with some potential customers.  But my husband and his old cronies love this restaurant and hope they do well and stay around for awhile.", "author": "Linda J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-08", "description": "This is now our new dim sum spot for a few reasons\n\n1. For the price, the food is very worth it.\n2. Usually, there isn't much of a wait.\n3. Food comes out quickly and it's always hot (which is a big plus especially since we've experienced cold/luke warm dim sum at another restaurant).\n4. Service is informal, but the staff is nice and helpful.\n\nCons include\n1. Parking, but this applies to most restaurants in the neighborhood.\n2. Decor isn't the most appealing.", "author": "klb l."}

Noticed that peanuts was given to every table but ours, had to ask for them. Food came out fairly quickly, but only one bowl of rice for the two of us. Again most of the smaller tables had a \"container\" of rice. We asked for more rice and was given one single bowl. The rock cod with tofu dish was not fresh. I got the feeling of vomiting during the meal.", "author": "M N."}

The interior is nice with its wood floors, yellow and turquoise walls, and nice chairs and table cloths. The service was friendly. However, the food (pot stickers, chicken feet, shredded duck rice noodles, and sizzling seafood) was all bland and, salty, greasy, and in the case of the seafood metallic. The restaurant, especially the area closest to the kitchen smells like cooked, unseasoned fish. There are plenty of better options in the richmond. Please, do yourself a favor and avoid Golden Gate.!", "author": "Brian S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-30", "description": "I love dim sum.  I would return to this restaurant, especially on a weekday when every dish is $1.90.  We went on a weekend and paid regular prices.  At this restaurant you fill out an order form and they bring you the food you ordered, which means that almost everything comes out very hot.  The wrapper on the steamed dim sum such as the shrimp dumplings and scallop dumplings were so thin that they stuck together and we had to let them cool a little before we could take one out of the steamer tray without taking more than one.  I loved the thin covering.  Almost everything we had was great except the black sesame filled ball.  That was heavy as compared to others that I've had.  I would definitely return to this restaurant.  The service was good.  They refilled our tea pot as soon as we tilted the lid as a signal for more water.", "author": "Jennifer G."}

I LOVE LOVE LOVE the steamed custard bun here.. some dim sum places.. the custard tastes all funky and nasty.. but this place.. its just perfect..  in fact.. im eating some right now =) they tend to run on the small size tho.. but back to my review.. a lot of people say that this place is pretty cheap.. but i don't really think so... i mean.. maybe its just because im used to chinatown dim sum prices...  eh.. wutever.. i'll still be coming back to this place!", "author": "JUDY L."}

The dumplings were actually pretty tasty and we speculated that they were left over from dim sum, but the broth was so watered down as to be tasteless (I hate when they destroy something good to be cheap)  They screwed up my order and did nothing about it, even after we pointed it out.  Their attitude seemed to be you ordered 3 items on the menu and you got three item, what's the problem?  The service was not good.  They have several servers there and they either clustered around a table or disappered, from the room entirely.  Given the economy, I want to support the local guys, but I will not come back, there are too many other restaurants in this neighborhood.", "author": "L C."}
