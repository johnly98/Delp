This place was packed (with a small group even sitting, chatting, and sipping on the stoop!) but we luckily found a couple of seats at the bar along the wall. I had a rose, and my husband had some variety of wine wine neither of us has heard of - both were very, very good. \n\nThey offer a few tempting small bites along with a selective menu of wines. Enough variety to be interesting, but not a library of selection.\n\nThe service was great - especially for such a packed little shop. Once we swooped in on our little spot, one of the staff behind the bar immediately came over and cleared the bar for us. Service at the bar was very helpful and fast.\n\nThe ambiance was inviting and cool, even with the crowd. The decor is thoughtful and sweet. There is a little couch in an old bunk bed frame if you're lucky to snag it!\n\nWe we're lucky to find a spot even for 2 people here - that's the only downside. If you're willing to wait for a spot, this is a chill place to check out!", "author": "Lauren S."}

I live right around the corner and have been meaning to stop by for ages. A friend and I ordered the vermouth flight and a red wine flight, at $15 each. The vermouth flight especially was a really good deal, and we accompanied it with some really tasty olives and cheese. I thought the cheese portions were generous by charcuterie standards and all were very tasty. \n\nA really special thing about this place is their cozy, homey vibe. I forgot to take a photo, but we sat in what is literally a transformed wooden bunk bed. Each table is different, and you kind of feel like you're drinking in this super cozy log cabin somewhere far away from the city. It's actually really amazing how well they manage to pull off such an intimate space without being too kitschy or tacky. \n\nI will say that the service was not great/ was confusing. When we ordered our two flights, it was at the bar, and we had to carry them over - which was fine.  However, we didn't seem to be able to get water and it took a really long time for us to order the additional food, as they seemed very understaffed and it was unclear whether we should flag a server down or get their attention at the bar. Also the two servers were very selectively friendly, smiling and chatting with certain patrons while ignoring others (us and a few other people) who were trying to get their attention. This felt really strange for such a small quiet bar, as it shouldn't have been so hard to order. That being said, I'd still come back. \n\nThe prices were super reasonable and it was so nice! Definitely would enjoy going on another date here.", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

I had met up with a girlfriend after dinner and we decided to explore the area. Using mainly Yelp to pick our spots, we decided to visit Fig & Thistle on Wednesday, July 12th around 10pm. We ordered at the bar and then found a seat on the lower part of the bunk bed in the corner. (At least I think it was a bunk bed. My time here is a little hazy.)\n\n*The Other Man 2016 Carbonic Zinfandel, Mendocino ($14 glass)\n*Purity 2014 Old Vine Carignan, Antioch, Contra Costa County ($13 glass)\n\nI wasn't familiar with any of the wines, so I just picked two glasses based on the names. One of them was very light, so I didn't enjoy it as much. I'm not familiar with carbonic wines. Honestly, I'm not even sure what that means, but judging from the year, I'm guessing the other man was the lighter one. We had been drinking cocktails at our two previous stops, so this was definitely not the full bodied and bold wine we wanted. The purity was good though. Not sure if we thought it was good just in comparison, but we enjoyed that glass.\n\nVery cute neighborhood bar. The atmosphere was dimly lit, but cozy. I vaguely recall there being hanging lights around the bed? Like the white Christmas lights you wrap around banisters, etc. Very pretty and an little romantic.

We ordered glasses of wine, which were MASSIVE, and holy moly they were GENEROUS pours. Perhaps it was because we visited so close to closing time, and they needed to get rid of their wine.

If you don't believe it, just google Beacon Hill Boston and see the images of the street. I ought to know. I spent a bit of time there last year and had gotten to know all the neighbors after my morning coffee and breakfast at the Paramount. \n\nAfter City Arts and Lectures (it was John Waters, very good), the evening was winding down and one could very quickly conclude that Thursday night in San Francisco is a ghost town. One would be right. At 9 PM the place is nearly deserted. Suits me just fine. A large table was waiting for me. So I ordered the mix plate of charcuterie and cheese. As I have finally reached the cross road of white vs. red, I have finally gotten on the band wagon of white. The staff recommends a Portuguese white as it's more stone fruity. He's right, I liked it more than the Rose from Sonoma.\n\nThe bunk bed is odd, it pretty much faces directly at me from where I'm sitting. It was empty for a little bit then a couple, in their 20s, showed up. Looking around, this is a bit of a millennial crowd, more on the sophisticated side of the spectrum, given the attire and the mannerism, but still, very young.\n\nThe bar serves a fairly good amount of beer on tap, suitably so, to serve the aforementioned clientele. \n\nIt's tucked away, right next to my last summer's crush, Monsieur Benjamin. For people like me who wants a little privacy, while enjoying a glass of wine, it's perfect.

I ended up taking whatever napkins he gave me and rushed back to our table to clean up. [side note: there was another staff member behind the bar who was great. He brought over a stain remover to help me remove the wine from my wife's jacket].  Meanwhile Chazz walks over and condescendingly asks whether I need more napkins and then walks away with a smirk. \n\nI get it. Everyone could have a bad day and may need a break. On a bad day, you may not want to smile at a customer or provide a great service, but going out of your way to walk over to your customers' table to insult them needs a whole different mindset.

I've been a few times before and enjoyed myself - it's a really tiny place with fun decor and a good atmosphere. You order your wine (glass or bottle) at the bar and then chill. \n\nWell a few weekends ago I came here with several friends and the bartender was a real snob. The menu was smaller than I recalled (but that could just be me misremembering) and there weren't that many red wines to choose from. We decided on the Sangiovese and I went to the bar to order a bottle for us. The bartender said they were out, but that he had another wine he thought was similar. \n\nHe poured me a tasting and I tried it and said it was good. He then starting pouring me a glass although I hadn't thought I actually ordered it. Okay, honest miscommunication since my \"it's good\" could have been interpreted that way. I told him that actually we wanted a bottle, but could he tell me the price first. It was $58 compared to $40 for the bottle we wanted originally. Now that's a pretty big price difference in my opinion, so I went to check with my friends and they agreed that we wanted something more affordable. I went back to the bar and asked him what other reds they had. I think he was annoyed because he's poured a glass of wine that I now didn't take. He asked me if price was the issue with the first bottle, and when I gave an honest \"yes\", he said we'd have a hard time because \"you get what you pay for\" - those were his exact words. \n\nBesides that being a rude thing to say to a customer, I actually find that absolutely not true with wine. Just because it's expensive doesn't make it better, particularly considering everyone's unique tastes. I've had $5 bottles of wine from Trader Joe's that were great and I've tasted $75 wine up in Sonoma that I didn't really care for. On top of that, a wine bar should only carry wine they consider good, regardless of price. I straight up told him that and he reluctantly agreed. I then gave up and ordered the Merlot which was the only other red under $50 - I'm not typically a huge fan of Merlot but this one was fine, so we hung out and drank it and overall had a good time enjoying each other's company.\n\nLuckily by the time I went up to close my tab, it was a different bartender on duty. I seriously sighed with relief that I didn't have to deal with the first guy, because honestly he made me feel embarrassed and uncomfortable. Yes it's a wine bar but you don't have to be a judgmental snob and scoff when we don't want to pay for a bottle almost $20 more than the one you ran out of...seriously dude.", "author": "Lindsey B."}

Filled with people, loud shouting and loud music. People are hanging out at the staircase, and the streets as there are already no space inside. The friend whom I wanted to show the place to thought I brought her to a frat party. Well, it was that kind of crowd with that kind of music. \n\nI felt it is a great thing for the business that they are doing well. But I hope they can keep to the vision and character that first inspire them to open the spot. With the decor you have got, this can't have been what you intend for.", "author": "Fung S. O."}

We visited this fig and thistle spot on a Friday night and cozied right up to the bar. Great gal served our cheese plate and we chatted for some time...then some guy walked in and posed as a bartender. He asked if we wanted to drink anything, which yes we did want to drink \"something\" at a bar. Our drinks and charcuterie arrive...charcuterie was ok...not so impressive over priced $22.00 charcuterie (note Jardiniere has a mind blowing $18.00 charcuterie!!!) anyway I digress. So back to weird male bartender...as we were sipping and eating he proceeds to open up the little plastic case that holds pickles and nuts and proceeds to stick his bare hands in and grab food to put in his mouth! Then every few minutes he'd grub some more. I guess he was hungry? Onto the bread... dips his bare hands In the bread container...man handles the bread grabs a few then chomps away! All in front of the patrons..5 min later he was talking to some other chicks at the bar then reaches over to the grape bowl and BAMN grabs a few and tosses in his mouth. I feel bad for the owner..I'm sure she would have had a mild coronary should she have seen her hungry employee grubbing with bare hands in the food tray. I never saw homie wash his hands from man handling the iPad to man handling the bread to later on after he had his hand in mouth preparing someone else's charcuterie!!!

Nice wine and beer list (all we had) but will be great to go back when we're in town. Congrats on your first!", "author": "bob o."}

This wine bar is great to get together with a group of friends, its not loud, perfect to catch up over yummy cheese plates. Love the location too!", "author": "SFlover D."}

By now you know where it is and that it is cute and casual, but what you may not know is it's perfect for a smaller private event! We ended up with about 15 people, the space was perfect, bright during the day and the owner was SO nice and accommodating, let's just say the mom-to-be was in tears over how wonderful it all was. I highly recommend this place for the after work drink (it can get a little busy, but where isn't in SF these days?), or weekend wine and cheese, or for a private party if they're available. I'd absolutely host my next event there without doubt!!", "author": "Sara K."}

Staff was great (all two of them), and they nailed it as far as ambiance goes.  Would like to have seen a few more food choices, but they explained it had something to do with licensing, so we opted for the cheese plate, which was very generous and delish!  Wine list was pretty great...would like to see a few more options.  Beer on tap would be nice, too, but not sure the small space/kitchen they have permits that.  Will definitely revisit this gem on my next trip to Hayes Valley!", "author": "Ariel D."}

Seriously though, the interior is perfectly crafted and is very intimate while at the same time the staff knows there stuff. They have a very very well curated selection of wine and beers as well as a rotating list of small plates, which are all very reasonably priced. Do yourself a favor and impress your date by taking them here and you won't regret it!", "author": "Andrew L."}
