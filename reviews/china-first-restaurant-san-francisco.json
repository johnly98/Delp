This restaurant is one of my usual haunts on Clement, along with Chili House, if I have time to sit down for awhile.  I don't share any of these complaints about service or slow kitchen or inauthentic food and if I did I wouldn't keep coming back.  If it's too crowded with Asian families for you, go somewhere else because they take their time over meals together.  Also, check the menu lists on the wall to see what appeals to you as some of that won't be on the printed menu.  It's billed as a seafood restaurant but I like the clay pots, frogs, egg dishes, snails when they're in, soups, and especially the salt and pepper shrimp with heads on.  If this isn't authentic Cantonese there are a lot of neighborhood regulars here who aren't any the wiser either.", "author": "Bob S."}

It's a typical Cantonese restaurant except the quality was really subpar compared to other Chinese places I frequent. I walked in here because I saw a good number of Chinese customers and thought this must be good and authentic. Little did I realize that the people who dine here must have low standards, or there just isn't a real quality Cantonese restaurant close by. We got the family dinners which is a set number of dishes predetermined for a price. The price was ok, I wouldn't call it cheap or pricey. But I was really surprised when the food came out and it was nothing I would have expected. It sounded great on the menu, but just ended up being very soy sauce based and barely cooked and mixed together food.  No skill in the cooking or flavoring at all. You can see right in the pictures on Yelp that the food is nothing but soy sauce and heavily fried. Was really disappointed and felt like I overpaid for this kind of food. Also the male server was super rude and racist. He wouldn't take our order so we waited an extra long time until the female server came and took it. And we weren't given the dessert that came with the dinner. The hostess gave us our bill and I asked where's the dessert. Super disrespectful and outwardly biased staff.", "author": "lilcooptown g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-01-10", "description": "In my early 20s of notorious dating days, there was once a Canadian diplomat's son who chased me for a while, his claim of fame was his impeccable Chinese and his family compound somewhere in the north. I forgot his name. But he took me to this restaurant often, because he lived in Inner Richmond and this place had incredible Chinese food. He was white. I was Chinese. We did not make far. But the restaurant made an impression. \n\nThe daily special finally raised its price from $4.25 to $5.75 after staying flat for over 10 years. The chalk on the wall special always has something very authentically chinese like the fried intestines or Chinese bacon and sausage baked rice in clay pot. While the name of the restaurant really is a copy of a very famous Hunan restaurant in Changsha, Hunan, the food is authentically Cantonese. My last few years of Chinese life was spent in Canton province, so on this particular night, I ordered the clay pot Chinese rice dish, crispy rice, with veggies and sausages and heavy dipping sauce, just like the ones I had when I was a little girl on the street corner of Guangzhou, the capital city of Canton, or Guangdong province. One of their special dishes was sauteed fish cake with pea sprout, that was the thing that often got served up in our cafeteria in my high school in Zhuhai. \n\nC ordered his General chicken. He had finally ventured out some and not just his typical Ku Pao any more, which in my world, is a plus. I got a low down of his recent romantic entanglement. He was very analytical, and showed me the pros and cons in both situations. This is why I have a hard time trusting straight men, those who are friends with me share with me their romantic intrigues often, and I've never ever met a guy who is faithful to just one girl. I know exactly what they think, how they think, and why they do what they do. For those meals I spent listening to straight men telling me about their romance and dating stories, I could write a book or open a clinic for women who are in search of love. I can tell these women all the dirty tricks men play on women. It's all very simple. Everything comes out over a nice meal.\n\nWe noticed that there were a lot of Chinese or mixed race couples. We also noticed that they give tables with only Chinese patrons red bean soup for dessert, and they give Laowai tables only fortune cookies. There are excellent fish dishes on the chalk board, but you must learn to read Chinese.\n\nI would stick to the basics if you are not as adventurous as some, because the cat fish two ways, with the cat fish head soup as one of the two ways, while is delicious to me, it may not sit so well when you can see why the fish is called \"cat\" up close and personal.\n\nI have recommended my friends to come here to eat whenever they are in Richmond. C and I come to Richmond and Sunset for meals often. It's our thing for many many months now. Each time we want to change it up, we end up in the same place. We've been here a few times now. I think I'll try that fish cake with pea sprout dish next, It reminded me of those last days in China, me, only 15 years of age, senior in high school, in pig tails, plaid dress and glasses, and I was finally rocking my Cantonese, after struggling to learn it in a year,  only to be told that I was getting shipped to America as an exchange student, and I needed to learn English, pronto.", "author": "Victoria E."}

But first... you should check out China First.  \n\nI hate to bring about such a harsh disillusionment, but I often feel like the Richmond area has more legit (and sanitary) Chinese food than Chinatown.\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\nWe came here for a birthday celebration because going to a Chinese restaurant with a group means family style Chinese food galore P:  Plus, they have duck!!  Not that you need a lot of people to eat a duck, but a family style duck feast is most certainly special-occasion-appropriate.\n\n[NO FRILLS]\n\nIt's a simple, no-frills, family-owned restaurant vibe.  No extravagant golden dragon and phoenix altars, but nothing too hole-in-the-wall to complain/rave about.  \n\nService is also no-frills--i.e. stoical but efficient--which I'm sure has caused some explosive short-tempered 1-star-review infuriations.  I thought they were quite nice and thoughtful as well; they made efforts to find the best table for us when the size of our group changed since our reservation.\n\nLastly, the menu is no-frills: you run into the problem that all the items have boring names, but trust me, they tend to turn out more delicious than they sound!  The cooking style is no-frills in that it tastes very homemade, which in my opinion is the best comfort food because it is indeed comforting without relying on excessive deep-friedness.\n\n[FOOD RECOMMENDATIONS]\n\nThe duck, of course.  Not as good as the legendary Peking duck from Great China at Berkeley, but still delicious.\n\nMy friends really like the clams in black bean sauce, but I'm not sure how to write about it in this review because I've never been a huge fan of this dish.  (I know, it doesn't make sense that I'm Chinese yet I like clam chowder more than Chinese style clams...)\n\nMy friends also rave out the wide flat rice noodles (ho fun), which I thought was pretty good.  Props to non-greasy stir-fried deliciousness!\n\n[TIPS]\n\n- Portions here are smaller than the typical huge endless plates of Chinese food; I would suggest ordering approximately 1 dish per person if you are hungry.  \n- Parking in the area is not impossible, but it's SF so you definitely want to seize the first spot you see.  Street parking in the area is free after 6pm.\n- There isn't really any need to worry about the crowd because the restaurant is not too tiny, and there is no Hong Kong Lounge-like dim sum brunch craziness.", "author": "Edna C."}

I told her to select the restaurant because she's more familiar with the area and knows which restaurant are good. She actually ordered for both of us because I didn't really know what I wanted. She ordered the Pan fried noodles, Mongolian beef and at the last second I order the seafood wonton soup.\n\nOur seafood wonton soup came out first and 10 minutes later our Mongolian beef and panfried noodles came out. The portions here are big. Off of our three dishes you could serve three people. \n\nThe seafood wonton soup was delicious. It was raining so the soup hit the spot. It had squid, imitation crab and veggies.\n\nThe mongolian beef was thinly sliced and it wasn't as greasy as I expected it to be. It  would've gone well with a side of steamed rice.\n\nThe Panfried noodles had vegetables, shrimp with mushrooms. What I really liked was that the noodles were crunchy. If you wait long enough the noodles get soggy from the juices from the veggies. \n\nLow prices, good food and big portions. You definitely get your moneys worth. Although, The servers could be more attentive. We had to keep raising our hand to get their attention but that still didn't do any good. They would just walk by our table and not even notice that we were trying to get their attention. They don't pay attention to their surroundings because several customers had to same problem as we did. Maybe it's because the servers were elderly. \n\nI would definitely come back here again.", "author": "Javier P."}

It's not the cleanest place, but its quick, and satisfies our cravings when we can't go home for some proper chinese food. \n\nUsually we get seafood fried rice, dry braised string beans, honey walnut prawns, Mongolian beef, salt and pepper chicken wings, dry pan fried seafood noodle, and sweet and sour pork. Food is your typical chinese style, drenched in oil type of food though. So don't expect some high quality food.\n\nService isn't the best here, but I noticed when I speak to them in chinese they're a bit nicer.

I understand that this a mom and pop joint, that this is a person trying to make a living but this experience you will see is just deserving of this poor rating.\n\nFirst off, this employee that we had the misfortune of having as our waiter obviously hates his job.  He should not be working there.  If I had an employee such as this person I would definitely fire him on the spot.  \n\nWe came here on a fine Sunday evening.  I really was against dinning here but the folks love a 'cheap' Chinese restaurant so this place was it as we were in the area.  The decor is definitely not the best as most cheap Chinese places aren't.  There were 5 of us and we were given 1 menu.  Yes folks, ONE menu for the 5 of us.  We did not see the waiter after he gave us this menu and had to find another one to read.  So this already left a sour taste in our mouth.  This place on this evening was also not busy so there was really not \"real\" excuse for the bad service as there is no real excuse in general for bad service.  \n\nSF is a competitive place to own a restaurant, you would think they would at least give decent service but we received hands down, the worse service I've ever had on this evening. \n\nWe ordered the Salty and Spicy peking ribs, mayo shrimp, egg drop soup, and tofu clay pot.  The first item that came out was the mayo shrimp and the most sorry looking burnt walnuts next to it.  My mother complained that the walnuts were burnt and this waiter, definitely condemned himself as he stated the following, \"I am not the chef and I don't make these walnuts burnt like that\".  WTF?!  Do we like go complain to the chef then???  The soup was bland as heck and needed some salt but I wasn't going to complain because at this point, what was the point of saying anything? you either took it or leave it.  \n\nThe icing on the cake was when we left him a lousy tip as he was a LOUSY waiter, he complained stating that the TIP WAS NOT RIGHT!!  We did not want to make a scene and just gave me him another dollar.  \n\nIf you like to be treated rudely and given burnt crap they call food, this is the place to go.", "author": "Eating And Living Well U."}

The restaurant was pretty busy,  food on other tables looked good, perhaps we didn't order the right stuff; the reviews were mixed.\n\nWe ordered the lobster noodle special ($18), 1/2 steam chicken, tomato egg beef and the smallest family dinner ($36) for six of us. The service was pretty typical of Chinese restaurant but not bad. \n\nThe family combination of $36 is a pretty good deal, we got seafood tofu soup enough for 6, walnut prawns nice and fresh, clams in black bean sauce - pretty decent, vege with chicken slices - ok and the fish (flounder) steamed instead deep fried. Nothing's wrong with this combination except there was hardly any meat for a hungry family.\n\nThe lobster noodle was just OK and presented in an interesting way that the few pieces of lobster were covered under the noodles.\nTomato beef was mostly tomato and the sauce was on the sweet side.\nThe 1/2 steam chicken with ginger sauce was rather disappointing, it was salty and kind of stale, tasted like leftover chicken reheated. We expected better as it's a pretty standard dish in Cantonese restaurants. Total bill was $80 before tips -  not too bad for a lot of food.\n\nNot in any rush to come back, if we do, will definitely try some different dishes.", "author": "Julie W."}

Today went by to eat and the place was partially full. Not a huge lunch crowd so as I scanned the menu, a small group of workers sat at the table to my right. They were almost immediately waited on for their order. I started to see others entering as I looked at the menu also being waited on. This has happened before so I didn't think much of it till several of the waiters and waitresses basically ignored me and walked past to other tables. After a few minutes of being pesty and calling out loudly: \"hey, I am ready to order\" several times, I was finally set upon by a waiter who took my order, as I loudly complained in his presence that others who came in AFTER me were waited on first while I was ready. As a weekly regular I expect at the very least a smile and to not be ignored. I ordered the Braised Catfish with fried Tofu in sauce, a small bowl of white rice, and Broccoli with Tofu. The Catfish arrived fairly quick, along with the rice, and soon after the Broccoli dish arrived too. The catfish had good taste but has a lot of spines and crunchy skin if you like that. I myself do not enjoy biting and every two seconds removing fish bone/spine out of my mouth; the tofu was good though. The broccoli was very good with the tofu also, and it made for a very tasty combination except for eating the catfish and picking the bones out. Later presented with the bill ($15.15), I left $15.16 to show my resentment at being ignored and I told the waiter I will not be back. He took the bill then basically stood 10ft from my table watching me as I got my things together to leave. I didn't know if he was watching me to ensure I didn't take any of the bowls or silverware (which I always get myself since flagging them to ask for it takes forever). \n\nSorry China First; this final time of ignoring has happened enough times and today it was the last straw. Two men at a table in front of me were waited on also before me though they were already in the restaurant as I walked in. As I was almost finished eating, they complained to the waiter asking where their food was. Considering they had been there as I entered, their order taken before me, I I ate before them. After their complaining, they got up and left. They had probably been sitting there with the complimentary soup and tea for way over 30mins while everyone around them were served. I don't blame them at all. \n\nThis makes China First  the China Last for me - I will not be returning.", "author": "Tony L."}

Those factors is what probably drags out crowds of people to dine here but my experience was alright. I had gone here with a party of 10 people and we ordered a multitude of items such as lemon chicken, tofu, mongolian beef, and several other items. The mongolian beef was very good, tender and juicy at each bite with green onions and tons of flavor. Everything else was average that I don't even remember or even bothered to snap a picture of. But there were several things I did not enjoy about the restaurant.\n\nThe restaurant has a health score of 98 from the last time I checked but why is the dining floor, the bathroom and even the water cups so dirty. I had something floating in my water and I was thinking, no more water for me. The other big con was the lemon chicken. I love lemon chicken and many places I have gone to especially Shangri La Chinese restaurant in Los Gatos make this specialty with big chunks of chicken or slices of chicken breast pieces. However, at China First, their lemon chicken was minced chicken with hardly any meat also. My friend and I said it best, all it was...was fried dough / batter. Where was the meat eh? I felt like the 8 bucks we spent on the lemon chicken dish was a waste because it was hard, dried pieces of fried batter. Don't order that dish and stick with just rice, tofu and mongolian beef.", "author": "Danster L."}

Unless you're going to the traditional ones that have the ginger and chicken soup. Anything you order is good and it is exactly how you expect, greasy delicious and full of carbs. There are a lot of more places that probably have specialty contempory chinese food. But it won't satisfy my cravings. I have been coming here for years. It's right where I can get some Genki crepes.

For our party of eight, we ordered one family dinner and some add-ons.\n\nFor $30.99 (feeds 2-3 persons):\n* Seafood Tofu Soup - Light soup that needs just a sprinkling of white pepper to give it that kick.\n\n* Clams with Black Bean Sauce - Comes with a lot of onions and bell peppers, not so much sauce though this time.\n\n* Walnut Prawns with Mayonnaise - Heavy on the mayo, which is a good and bad thing.  My almost 6 year old nephew was loving the candied walnuts, but didn't like the mayo.\n\n* Chicken with Greens - Chicken on bok choy, the least favorite of all that we ordered and had leftovers of.\n\n* Deep Fried Sanddab with Soy Sauce - Arrived last, but still gobbled up.  Something about their oil, it just wins here!\n\nAdditional dishes:\n* Szechuan Eggplant with Shredded Pork ($4.25) - I don't recall ever getting this before here, but I really enjoyed and couldn't stop eating it.  There was just something so tasty about it.\n\n* Deep Fried Tofu with Shredded Pork ($4.25) - Always a favorite for our family, and the thick gravy has to be smothered all over the tofu 'cuz that's what makes it good.\n\n* Seasonal Green Veggies - I'm the one requesting some sort of greens at our table, and this is what they had in season.  Not sure what it's called in English or Chinese, but it was still good.\n\n* Snails - We called ahead to make sure they had it and was probably why we came in the first place.\n\n* Ground Pork with Salted Fish - Something I can make at home, but my family still likes to order it. Goes great as leftovers on some rice.  \n\n* Salted Pepper Squid ($4.25) - I almost forgot how good their deep-fried things were until I got my mouth wrapped around one of these.  And I just couldn't stop. I thought I was done eating, but these are just so tasty!\n\n* Salted Pepper Prawns with Shell ($6.50) - I think it's a bit messy working the shells off, but my family enjoys getting this anyway and it goes!\n\n* Salted Pepper Chicken Wings ($4.25) - I didn't get any this time around, but it obviously was good since it disappeared so fast!\n\n* Red Bean Soup - Bummer that they served this 'cuz I still don't like it.  Blah.\n\nService is nothing to write home about, it's basic and you definitely have to wave them down for refills on anything.  But the food comes out quickly (for the most part), although it seemed like we were missing a few dishes and had to remind them.  I'll overlook the lack of service because I'm too busy stuffing my face on the good food!  It's always busy for dinner, which is a good thing in my book.

I mean, it's the best part because it's tender and has texture!!!\nOne time I was dining at a restaurant in the Mid-West and a woman at the table next to me totally freaked out because she had never seen a squid head before on her plate.

The place was packed with CHINESE people.  Another good sign.\n\nThe food:\nFried fish and soy sauce (san dabs, flounder, cat fish): perfectly fried.  Not too cripsy, not too doughy.  A bit salty, but the seasoning used in the batter was delicious.  Dip your bits of fish in the soy sauce at the bottom of the plate, and you'll be in heaven!\n\nClams in black bean sauce with saut\u00e9ed bell peppers and onions: great combo with rice.  The sauce alone deserves 5 stars.  The saut\u00e9ed vegetables over rice is so good.  And the of course, you have the clams, which weren't rubbery at all.\n\nOverall:\nI came here with two other friends.  For about $15/person, we got two seafood dishes, half a roasted duck, a \"choy\" (vegetable), and rice.  If you're expecting Panda Express dishes, just keep walking.  If you're looking for dishes a little more \"ethnic,\" then give China First a shot, it'll definitely hit the spot.", "author": "Matt S."}

It has that cool old school style and service was prompt and hard working and it was packed. We saw Asian and Caucasian patrons and figured the food must be good to attract both crowds. We ordered fried flounder, scrambled eggs with radish, mu shu pork, and salty egg and chicken tofu clay pot. Taste was decent. The thing that sucked though was that we both felt queasy when we got home and then it launched to full blown poisoning through the night. Our back and muscles ached and stomach hurt and we felt shaky and nauseous. It was awful. We are Asian and we love Asian cuisine and we typically have hardy tummies and can eat anything. Something was so wrong here. We are never going back. I recommend going to Taiwan Restaurant which is nearby. That was where we were going before this places piqued our interest as we were walking. *sighs* lesson learned! Not coming back to this place ever again! :( I don't normally write negative reviews but I wanted to report this one because it is not sanitary and it is not okay to have your health put at risk by a restaurant business!

Whoah...good service at a Chinese restaurant is like water and oil, Iran vs. Iraq, Giants vs. Dodgers, North Korea vs. South Korea, Kid Rock vs. Tommy Lee...you get the picture. But thanks to Marian G., she gave me quite the low down on this place. You can say she hooked me up. \n\nLocated on busy Clement Street with other restaurants competing for your business, the place is unassuming and it doesn't stand out. No flashy signs, no hoopla, no gimmick to attract you...just a good solid restaurant. I've driven here numerous times and passed this place on many occasions. I should've paid more attention to the line outside this place.\n\nYes, when we arrived, the place was packed and several people were on the waiting list. We didn't mind since my theory is that if the line is long, then it must be good. We waited approximately half an hour and I also took that time to look around the neighborhood. Hey....there's a Genki Crepe just a couple of stores away. (We went there for dessert)\n\nSo the nice lady sat us and gave us the big round table that would normally fit eight to ten people. There were only four of us so there were plenty of room to order a ton of food. We also gawked at other tables to see what they had ordered and what looks good. We looked at their menu and everything was inexpensive. Almost every item they had was under ten dollars. They even have a special section for $ 4.25 which you can order any time of day.\n\nFor starters, we ordered fried won-tons and calamari under the special section. We were happy to see that they gave us a dozen fried won-tons, which we divided into three a piece. It comes with a sweet and sour sauce and it was a nice start. The calamari was labeled as spicy but it was mild. We still liked the saltiness at it was nicely seasoned.\n\nThe server was also kind enough to recommend us a vegetable dish: Chinese greens with garlic and salty goodness it was delicious. We also had the steamed catfish, Mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork, seafood pan fried noodles, deep fried tofu with shredded pork, BBQ fried rice and a bowl of regular white rice. We pretty much filled up the entire table and everything was good and the kids approved. \n\nThe total bill came to only $ 64.75 and we had plenty of leftovers to take home. Gee...Marian G. was right. Good food and good service does happen in a Chinese restaurant. I told the server that I'll be back like the Terminator.", "author": "John G."}

Chinese restaurants line the streets, so you have to be competitive to survive and boy... does this place compete.

It was a montage of cookery.  Done in a low-tech, country-style Chinese kitchen/cooking area.  There were no Wolf brand ranges.  No Kitchenaid ovens.  Instead, the film showcased clay pots, smokers made out of oil drums, bamboo baskets, woks, woks, and more woks.  \n\nIt might just be because I'm Asian (surprise!) but I regard the wok as an instrument of MAGIC.  With this one curved piece of metal, numerous and varied dishes can claim their origin.  Does a person really need a different kitchen utensil for cooking asparagus vs broccoli?  How about an egg poacher?  How many different types of whisks does one need?  If you listen to Williams Sonoma or Sur La Table, your collection will never be complete.  But you are also likely the type of person who blames the tools for inferior results, rather than improve the technique.  \n\nThis is why you should stay away from the Panda Express type dishes.  If you want orange chicken, go to Panda Express.  \n\nThis restaurant serves many different dishes.  I came here with my parents and with my \"uncle\" and \"aunt.\"  We ordered the half duck, salt and pepper squid, steamed tofu with minced shrimp, mixed vegetables with tofu, beef tendon with ginger and scallion clay pot, pork soup with mustard greens, chicken salad, and salt and pepper crab!\n\nThey serve crab here!  For $23.  And the crab was very tasty.  The pieces were cracked for easy retrieval.  There was a light, crispy coating of dry batter that was flavorful and crunchy.  The meat was succulent.  It was spicy and delicious.  I can't tell the difference between this crab and PPQ.  It was a little bit too salty though.  Just a touch.  And I was really thirsty.\n\nAnd then, when I got up to use the bathroom, my \"uncle\" thought I was getting up to pay so he made a mad dash for the cash register and paid for the meal.

Both times, I've come in large groups (10+) and there has never been any trouble getting seated.  The waiters are friendly enough, and didn't mind that we just sat there, waiting for several minutes until our entire group arrived.  \n\nOn our last visit, we ordered:\n\n-Salt and Pepper Calamari: very crispy, freshly fried.  The batter is light and the calamaris seems to be done just right- not chewy at all.\n\n-Peking Spareribs: these were just okay, I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\n-Chicken Egg Foo Young: kind of like a giant omelet (?).  I've never ordered this before, but my friend wanted to try it.  It was interesting and okay tasting, but I don't know if it is as tasty as some of the other dishes.  \n\n-Seafood Fried Noodles: these were pretty good.  The noodles were very crispy and there was a variety of seafood: scallops, calamari, shrimp.\n\n-Corn and Egg Cod filets: this is a dish of fried fish filets covered in a creamy, corn and egg sauce.  It may sound sort of strange, but its very tasty- it's great over rice.  \n\n-Mongolian Beef: this dish was a bit spicy and I liked it.  The dish was primary beef, not other random filler.  It was good.\n\n-Wet Chow Fun: the chow fun was decent.  Nothing great or horrible about it.  I think it came to our table when I was already full, so I don't have much to say about it.\n\n-Garlic Green Beans: they use a good amount of garlic, which I like.  The green beans were nicely cooked- with plenty of flavor and seasoning and still having a nice crunch/crispness to them.\n\n-Foo King Fried Rice (two orders): this is fried rice covered in gravy.  Very delicious.  My friends who go here more often say that they always order this.  Everyone seemed to love this dish- hence, the two orders.\n\n-Some other vegetable (not memorable): I think we got some sort of boy choy? Don't remember- too much food.  \n\nThe prices are really cheap.  The total for the 10 or so dishes (I really lost count of how much we ordered) was only $77.  What a steal.  A great place for cheap, tasty, large portions.  Probably not the nicest place for a date though.", "author": "Samantha L."}

The staff is always friendly, and there is always someone there to write down my order once I'm ready. Their menu is a great steal too! A group of 10 can eat an authentic Chinese meal, and still be able to spend their money frugally.\n\nTheir salt and pepper squid is my favorite dish. The taste of it always buffets me with a delicious salty flavor backed up with an enjoyable crispy texture.  China First also sells clam for a cheap price as well, and the way they cook it is absolutely scrumptious. They have a rich sauce that is to die for. \n\nThe cleanliness of the store needs a bit of an upgrade however as the previous posters has stated. There was a few times where my dishes were a bit soapy, but overall this restaurant is great!", "author": "Anthony H."}

I know that makes me sound paranoid (at best) or closed-minded and a jingoist (at worst) but if Jojo got that vibe and I got that vibe, there must be SOMETHING to it, don'tcha think?\n\nI really wanted to like this place.  I've gone twice in two days, and both times yielded really UNIMPRESSIVE food experiences.  Yesterday I had the Beef Chow Fun Dried.  Utterly Flavorless. I will give them credit for using beef that looked and felt like beef, but the dish had NO FLAVOR, neither the beef nor the noodles tasted like anything.  I had to pour on the soy sauce just to get some kind of taste going.  Bummer.  Cheap, like $6 I think, but a bummer.\n\nThe previous night I went with a friend for late dinner.  I was very happy to see all the selections on the wall.  This place has a very wide and deep menu, with enough choices to satisfy everyone: vegetarians, pescetarians, and meat eaters.  Plenty of Chinese greens (Tao Meo/Pea Sprouts being my favorite) and mushrooms and Chinese sausage and just a huge variety.  So I was psyched.  \n\nWe see the fish section of the menu.  There's a Whole Deep Fried Flounder listed for something like $12.95, maybe $14.95.  We ask our server: \"What WHOLE FISH do you have that we could get maybe STEAMED as opposed to deep fried?\" He tells us Flounder or Rock Cod.  Cool, let's go with a steamed, whole rock cod and some Tao Meo with garlic on the side.  \n\nFish was just okay.  Honestly, not a lot of \"meat\" there for two guys to eat. Well-prepared and all, but not filling.  Fine, whatever, I'll get something more to eat on the way home, no biggie.  Veggies were GREAT by the way (that's why I'm not giving them 1 star.)\n\nThe bill arrives.  $40.  What?  This can't be right.  Two dishes?  Forty bucks?  We  ask our server, \"Is this OUR bill?  What's this $27 charge?\"  Fish is 18.95 a pound, he replies.  The fish we got was 1.5 pounds.  $27 for the un-fliing whole rock cod.  Whole Flounder is $15 at most, but our whole rock cod was nearly double.  DAMN.  I'll admit, I made the ASSUMPTION here, so the lesson learned is to always ask, but nothing like this has ever happened before.  I don't think it was unreasonable to expect the price of the rock cod (rock cod for crying out loud, not Halibut, not Free Range Salmon) to COMPARABLE to that of the flounder.  Unless .... they were looking ... to screw over non-Asians.  Hmmmm.\n\nAnd even with that bad first experience I was so impressed with their menu that I went back the next day to order something very simple, very straight forward, right off the menu.  And it (the beef chow fun) was lame.  \n\nFeh.  Maybe I'll go back if I can be the one \"round eye\" in a group of four Asians, but for now I'll keep searching for better places to eat.", "author": "Invisible J."}

Unfortunately, the (half order) of Peking Duck was a bit dry. The fortune cookie also seemed a little stale.\n\nOverall the prices were very reasonable and looking around at what other people ordered it seemed like there was a lot more good food to try.", "author": "Jeff L."}

It was served with rice that was not even warm, let alone sizzling, and instead of the heal all clear broth, ours was an opaque white, and then I realized it had squid not chicken, no mushrooms, or snow peas, or any of the typical ingredients. Still I thought this maybe their version of it, and figured it would be great when I tasted it. It was so bad I couldn't even finish it, and I didn't, and instead moved on to another of our old time favorites, Barbequeued Pork Foo Yung. It had no bean sprouts as I am used to, and was so overcooked that it crunched at ever bite, in spite of being served in a substantial amount of brown gravy.\nOK I decided to have some Pork Fried Rice, how can that be bad right. It had no meat at all and had the unavoidable (and I mean even when drowned in soy sauce), and there was no getting away from the absolutely completely burnt flavor. I didn' finish even 2 tablespoons, before I made a last ditch effort for the Beef with Bok Choy over Hong Kong Style pan fried noodles. The noodles were orange and so hard that it was not possible for me to eat this dish with chop sticks. There was nearly no gravy at all, and there were no bamboo shoots at all.\nI hate to say that bad treatment was custom made for me, but this felt very much like that, otherwise I am loathe to explain the very positive reviews by so many before me. I didn't have any exchange with anyone there so I don't know what it could've been over.\nStill I would discourage anyone who didn't get much sun this summer, from going to this establishment.

I should have fought my way out of there like a christmasy Bruce Willis. But no. I tried reason. I asked the waiter what the fried meat cum pineapple blob dish was (appearance of food, not quote to waiter) since I'd ordered something else.\n\nThe restaurant wasn't crowded (another flag). But the waiter, a short, peevish older man, got about three inches from my face and angrily demanded that I accept the fried blobs as my xmas entree.  \"ITS GOOD! TRY TRY. NO CHOICE.\"\n\n???\n\nHe's standing over me. I have to ask him to back up.\n\n???\n\nI politely declined the chicken blobs. \n\nA sort of tan, whitish kung po chicken was substituted (which doesn't look cooked or flavored. yay. time to break out spicy black bean dip. i love it when i have to cook my leftovers. sigh).\n\nWhen I left, I found the manager and explained my concerns.

The really nice thing about China First is that they have a large variety of plates in seafood, chicken, pork, vegetables in rice, noodle, soup,and stir fried. Plates range from as little as $4 to no more than $7-$8 (people, this is as cheap as it gets).\n\nWe ordered three plates: seafood chow fun, gai lan with oyster sauce, and kung pow chicken. Orders don't come with any sides, so be sure to order rice separately. Our gai lan was the first to arrive, and it was chopped up pretty awkwardly and sloppily. I couldn't even get it to grip on my chopsticks. The seafood chow fun was really watered down in sauce, and the kung pow chicken was way too greasy. Overall, I thought it everything tasted plain and nothing was prepared well. I think it might be due to the fact that they are generally pretty busy during weeknights.

In the city, in Napa, the East Bay, the South Bay.  And price has been no object.  For the most part I can afford it.  Time was, when I lived in New York, that money did matter more and I still loved food.   Then, I went to Chinatown.  On the Chinatown trail as I used to call it.  This evening I rediscovered my roots at a wonderful Chinese restaurant in Inner Richmond.  \n\nWhen I entered China First at five fifteen on Sunday evening the place was packed with Chinese families.  Obviously, everyone in the neighborhood is onto a really good thing.  The menu is long.  Specials are listed on the wall.  But the thing you will notice first is the remarkably low prices.  Can they really serve wonderful or even good or even passable food at such prices? You bet.\n\nI started with a heaping plate of salt and pepper squid.  The squid were lightly battered and flash fried so the seafood remained tender.  And the coating had a wonderfully lively burst of pepper.  Around the squid were thinly cut sections of chili peppers.  Just the incendiary needed to complete a great plate of food.  And for $4.25?  A miracle.\n\nNext an immense bowl filled with shrimp and scallops in lobster sauce.    The seafood was absolutely fresh and not overcooked.  The sauce was nice enough, particularly as there was plenty of sliced and very tender pork and black beans within it.  For $7.95 this plate was a near miracle.  \n\nEnglish isn't the strong point of the waiters. But I carefully pointed out what I wanted and got it.  As in many Chinese places everything came at once.  Next time I will just order one plate of food at a time.\n\nThere certainly will be a next time and soon.  Love this place.", "author": "David D."}

Being there about 4 pm when we walked in the place was full and there was no waiter to seat us, they were understaffed.  The problem came when I asked for a glass of water. A simple request.  After we seated and ordered. The water walked by with a jug of water and as he passed I said I'd like a glass too.  He heard me but did not respond.  He went back and forth. I asked for a glass of water again, he very slight acknowledged he heard me and went back and forth past our table which was ten feet from the kitchen. He worked behind the counter while I waited. My husband was sweating in the poorly ventilated place so I was anxious to get him the glass of water. He passed my table holding two tea pots - I waited.  He brought someone a bill - I waited. Meanwhile my husband asked him when he passed by. He said ok.  No water came. He purposely made us wait.  Ther was NO OTHER staff in the restaurant we could ask. When I asked him When will we get the water the asshole made a scene saying he's the only one around and he was busy. First I  felt totally ignored. Then he topped it by being RUDE with a capital R.  Is it possible that we had to ask four times?????  The bill came for a dish of vegetables, one sweet and sour chicken and rice for two to be $25.   I had no idea the plate of vegetables was $13.95 which I asked him to recommend when I ordered. He pointed to a sign in Chinese which I obviously can't read.   My problem was he totally ignored me when I asked for water and he purposely had us wait since he walked by about five times and even stood behind the cashier counter. He actually delivered the water after 4 f..... times asked and then created a scene AS IF I WAS ON THE WRONG.  Why would anyone patronize this cheap low class restaurant?  There are many Chinese restaurants with better quality food. The sweet and sour chicken did it have a lots of chicken more onions and bell peppers.   We've given them a chance since in the past the fish clay pots contained fish bones and no meat.  They dumped the rubbish in there and the waiter actually took it to our table.

Seafood is a specialty, though some vegetable and noodle dishes were also nice.  The menu is vast - a regular sized printed menu, and then eight or ten big signs on the wall with ten items each, no duplicates.  Some are written only in Chinese, and the English descriptions aren't always helpful.\n\nSuper-inexpensive - the basic dishes are mostly $5 to $6, and specials on the wall are $7 to $10.  And a few special things like whole crab, or the lobster noodle, are $15-20.  Each plate is big enough for two.\n\nService is a group effort.  There are lots of waiters, food runners, and managers running around, and you never know who's going to come by with your food.  You have to wave at them or call them over, otherwise nothing's going to happen.  If you're sitting by the kitchen that's great.  If you're out on the edge, it may be a while before you can get attention.  Not everyone speaks English fluently, and they rush by so fast you'd better talk fast.\n\nGiven the price and style, the decor is two steps nicer and cleaner, the staff is a few measures more friendly and helpful, and the food much fresher and tastier than expected.\n\nFor what it's worth the diners were about 90% Asian, half of those speaking Cantonese.  Most are in large groups, five to ten.  There are only a few smaller tables here.", "author": "Gil S."}

My first time was approx. 2 years ago, and I tried it again a few weeks ago. When I first tried their food, it was okay. Everything was pretty mediocre and the only thing keeping me there was that it was my cousin's birthday and a very attractive waiter. Now, I noticed a complete change. I am a college student with a small budget and I had just ended class at 10pm. Most places were closed and I came across this restaurant again. I figured, \"What the hell, I need some food\" So I walked in. \nI was greeted very kindly by the hostess and took my seat. The place doesn't look too extravagant, it was kind of homely. I looked at the menu and MY GOODNESS, perfectly cheap for this poor college student. They also had a set menu with fried fish, seafood tofu soup, walnut shrimp, etc. So I chose the set menu because it had 4 or 5 dishes and rice only for (I believe I only paid) $40. I don't quite remember but it was cheap enough. The workers are all really nice, minus the language barrier with some. The soup was much better than I remembered a few years back. Then came the real food. The vegetables they serve are quite awful (sad because I need some veggies when I eat Chinese food) but the fish, the walnut shrimp, etc was delicious and definitely worth the price. There was one chicken item I ordered for a friend, but they said it tasted like rubber. So try to not order chicken or veggies here. But everything else was quite delicious and they are open til pretty late (which works nicely with my college finances and schedule). \n\nSo overall, don't order the veggies or chicken but I highly recommend their shrimp and fish.", "author": "Cathy V."}

The dishes didn't come in order for some reason like it usually does but the food was pretty darn good and super cheap too! 10 dishes with FREE soda and dessert...most places charge for soda. Service was mediocre as is expected from most Chinese restaurants but they were accommodating with our requests when we brought our own alcohol and cake. Here is the breakdown of the 10 dishes... \n\n- assorted cold platter: The jelly noodle thingy in the middle was bland at first but then I realized that we were supposed to eat it with the pickled veggies underneath it...it was tasty and the different meats around the plate were pretty typical.\n\n- crab meat shark fin soup: I LOVE shark fin soup and this was definitely a hit in my book! Lots of real shark fin and other ingredients....perfectly seasoned and not too thick or watery. I had 2 bowls of it...haha\n\n- steamed boneless chicken with veggies: The chicken was super moist, laden with sauce and the veggie that came with it was Chinese broccoli...not my favorite dish but wasn't bad.\n\n- broccoli with scallops and prawns: This was a really simple dish...I liked the mushrooms in it and loved how the broccoli soaked up the yummy sauce.\n\n- mince dried oyster with lettuce: For some reason I don't remember eating any dried oyster...that means this wasn't a memorable dish. lol\n\n- lobster with ginger and green onion: Instead of having one huge lobster, this dish consisted of 2 smaller lobsters. It was bursting with flavor and it's great how lobster is so easy to eat compared to crab. =P This is also another one of my favorite dishes!\n\n- beef cubes in honey sauce: The beef was really tender and flavorful...the level of sweetness was just right and goes great with white rice.\n\n- black mushroom over sliced abalone: I also really enjoy eating mushrooms so another fave of mine...the sauce was delicious over rice too but you can tell the abalone isn't fresh (aka canned) but that just means the meat is less tough to eat.\n\n- steamed seasonal fish: This dish was ok...it was a little bland for my taste (not enough soy sauce?) and they didn't take the meat off of the bones like a lot of other Chinese restaurants do for you.\n\n- chinese ham and dried scallop fried rice: A signature dish of theirs and lived up to my expectations! The ham and dried scallop complimented each other really well and the rice was just yummy. I had 2 bowls of this also...yes I'm a fatty. \n\n- dessert: I think the dessert was the worst part (even though it was free) because it was made with dried bean curd skin and it was too cold to be a hot dessert.\n\nOverall, my experience here was a good one and everyone raved about the food.

Years pass and I would sigh while everyone chomping away on butter drawn lobster, salt/pepper crab or black bean sauce or  garlic scallion crab or my ultimate fav curry crab!  Then a few months back, I went to an Elite Event and ate an appetizer that had real crab meat in it and  to my delight I did not have an anaphylaxtic reaction!\n\nI have been easing my way back and found that not only crab but I can have lobster!   So, I was on Clement Street and stopped into China First for my usual lunch.  I spied the tanks of lobster, shrimps, Alaskan Crab and the \"Crab\".   The waiter allowed me to pick my crab and made that wonderful curry crab with succulent sauce ($17/each).  My guest and I were slurping and licking our fingers that as people came in they ordered the curry crab.  Imagine 4 tables slurping and licking their fingers.  It was paradise.  Btw,the  Boston Lobster ($16),the 2 flavored Lobster ($18/lb) was huge and that is my next choice on my next trip.", "author": "Marian G."}

Definitely the best Chinese on Clement. I've been going to this place for nearly ten years. The place looks a bit run down, but by Chinese restaurant standards, it's fine. The food and food service is clean, and that's what counts.\n\nRecommendations: the salted pepper pork chops, salted pepper shrimp (they're whole, in case you're squeemish), and hakka salty chicken. The fried rice isn't bad, and if you want fish, the deep fried sand dab is a good choice. When dungeness crab is in season, go for the crab fried with ginger and scallions. It's better than Crustaceans, at half the price.\n\nWhy five stars? They're not spectacular, but they're consistently reliable, friendly, open, and over the last decade, I've never ordered a single dish I didn't like.

A group of us ordered the smallest banquet option possible, coming out to $27 per person. This is a reasonable deal considering the diversity of dishes and sheer volume of food - there were leftovers of almost everything! \n\n- Hot and sour soup: not too sour, lots of solid bits of beef, tofu, bamboo shoots, mushroooms, etc throughout. Well done.\n\n- Jellyfish with cured pork slices: my first time eating this fun-textured delight! nice contrast of the delicate mildness of jellyfish with the salty pork.\n\n- BBQ pork: tender and tasty, one of the dishes that was killed by the table.\n\n- Crispy soy chicken: wonderfully crisp skin, tasty flesh.\n\n- Steamed oysters on shell: huge, but their size was almost too much, especially coming out so late in the lineup...I usually love oysters but wasn't feelin' them that night. Perhaps the oysters were not very fresh?\n\n- Chinese broccoli w/ mushrooms: nice large shiitake mushrooms, good flavor. I took this home and enjoyed it the next day.\n\n- Seafood delightish mix w/ broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, etc: another standard done well.\n\n- Steamed catfish: oooh, I really enjoyed this! Simple steamed preparation with ginger, soy, scallions.\n\n- A heaping plate of orange slices, but no fortune cookies: boo!\n\nOverall, it was a very solid meal, but my socks stayed on. I would definitely consider hitting up China First again for the a la carte deals and might even be persuaded (not that it really takes that much) to partake in a banquest once more.

We ordered Mu Shu Vegetable and Kung Pao Tofu -- which shouldn't have been difficult as Mu Shu Pork and Kung Pao Chicken were on the menu -- but their willingness to work with and accommodate was much appreciated.  We also ordered the Broccoli and Garlic.\n\nThe food, overall, was terrible.  The Mu Shu Vegetable was actually pretty good.  Da Lian in Berkeley is light-years ahead, but were I ever to return -- which I never will -- I'd get it again.  The plum sauce, however, left much to be desired.  The Kung Pao and the Broccoli and Garlic were awful.  \n\nMy principal problem with this resturant is its over-bearing use of MSG.  I had MSG-mouth for hours after leaving the restaurant.  The after-taste lingered like an unwanted party guest.  Without it, perhaps the food would have been bland.  The Kung Pao had no flavor anyway.  The broccoli -- which otherwise seemed fresh -- tasted like MSG.  I'm having fearful flashbacks recounting the trauma.  I may as well have simply brought my container of Accent and eaten right out of the jar.  Disgusting.\n\nI give the restaurant 2-stars merely because they were pleasant and accommodating.  The food, however, was center-city, missionary position 1-star.  I may have felt differently had I done MSG doggie-style and/or were I willing to attempt their more exotic entrees, such as duck's tongue, frog noodle, or some of the live fish opitons.  Given their heavy use of flavor enhancers, I imagine all of the food is MSG saturated as well.\n\nIts presentation is deceptive because virtually everyone in the restaurant is Asian -- so one is led to believe it is authentic.  Given the Chinese infatuation with MSG, perhaps it is.  If this food is authentic, give me American-style Chinese any day.\n\nI won't return.  Ever.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Quality is low but cost is low, so if you want cheap food then its not such a bad idea.  It's crowded, and justifiably so because you can eat quite decently for 10 bucks a person.  The restaurant definitely isn't big at all, with 4 large banquet tables and a bunch of smaller ones.  Bathroom is dirty, really feels like you're in China.  Usually its OK for  a Chinese restaurant to have a not-so-clean restroom but this was just horrible.\n\nService is spotty at best.  Ask for ice water, and you get a pitcher and self serve cups.  Food portions were not as big as larger and more well known restaurants, but still decent for the price.  My one gripe is that they don't have the 'slippery\" tofu, the type that just melts in your mouth.  Two of our dishes required it, but they used the rougher tofu that tastes no good.  The walnut prawns....people said the shrimp tasted spoiled but for 8 bucks...maybe it was spoiled shrimp.  Food is mediocre at best.\n\nSave your money and if you want to eat cheap, go to one of the Clement cafes.

Fortunately, my host and her other guests arrived early and already had our table secured.\n\nWe were celebrating my mother's birthday. Eleven of us in total. While the table was large enough for us, the lazy susan couldn't hold all the dishes as they were brought to us very quickly, one right after another. We had to play musical dishes a bit. Somewhat odd for a birthday banquet. I was surprised by the rushed service since I've seen other reviewers comment on the slowness of it.\n\nAnyway, the waiters were very friendly and the food was excellent. We had two different kinds of steamed fish as they didn't have one large enough for all of us. Both were flavorful and tender. We had crab cooked in a curry sauce which was both unusual and delicious, though salt and pepper is still my favorite. But we had salt and pepper lobster and it was absolutely fabulous. The clams in black bean sauce were larger than normal and tender, plus they hadn't fallen out of their shells as one finds at many other places. We had a lettuce-wrap chicken for appetizer which was above average but not exceptional, though the portions were very large. The soup was a bit cold by the time we got to it, since they brought it and dished it into separate bowls before folks had a chance to finish the appetizer. There was also a chicken with dipping salt/pepper and a beef. Both were good.\n\nThe restaurant staff had no problem with us bringing our own wine and charged a very small corkage fee per table. Our hostess brought a birthday cake which they gladly cut and serve for us.\n\nParking, of course, is horrendous and the bathrooms are not for the weak.

Our first appetizer (Fish Maw Soup) was quite authentic and very lightly seasoned, which is a pleasant departure from sodium-laden gut-stuffers.   \r\n\r\nThe Mongolian Chicken, Deep Fried Quail (with 5-spice dip) were generous on our figures and were even presented nicely.  Again, I haven't before tasted such lightly and precisely seasoned dishes.  The very absense of flavor enhancers seemed to bring out the flavor. \r\n\r\nWe were the only party in the restaurant for most of our brunch, and while that raised a few red flags, we quickly learned that sometimes, in the most improbable of places, the best food awaits!!", "author": "Daniel C."}

It's really flavorful and they prepare your food extremely fast.  I love their Peking Pork, Salt and Pepper Prawns, and Crab (when it's in season).  They always have specials written on white boards that line the walls.  I've never had really bad service here.  The food may change depending on who the cooks are as they may come and go but all the times I've gone it's been good.\n\nTo tell you the truth I never expect great service from a Chinese restaurant.  Most of the regular Chinese places aren't upscale and cater to a different crowd.  It's just something you have to get used to.  It's like some unwritten rule.  Chinese joints don't offer the same service as American places or other types of restaurants.  Yes there are some out there that do, but that's their main focus.  Their prices are usually higher, their portions are smaller, and food isn't as good.  If you talk to someone who's Chinese and knows their stuff they can probably name places like that.  Just don't come in expecting to be treated the same so you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Terrence L."}

Last night I dropped in around 9pm and there was about two tables with customers.  The big table in the back was full of the staff gorging themselves in plain view of myself and the other customers.  A little guy came over and put a pot of tea and menu in front of me and hurriedly returned to his meal.  I ordered a beer and decided that I couldn't eat while watching the staff stuff their face.  I just find it disgusting.  I know the eat same as everyone but I don't want to see it in a restaurant.  So I asked for the bill and the little guy said $8.30.  I gave a $20 and was returned $13.20 change.  I thought that was a little expensive and looked in the menu and sure enough a beer is $3.20.  I protested and between the little guy and the girl behind the counter that made change they argued that I had pocketed the $5 in a very rude and accusatory manor.  I make very good money at my job and I travel to China a lot.  I recognize it was a face saving exercise but I was a regular and a neighbor and this isn't China.  It was incredibly rude, inappropriate and sad.  To sacrifice your character and honor over $5 is a state of affairs.  The food is soso and the prices high but I went there because they were open late while other places were closed.  So I'm sad but now I have seen the real side of this place and will not return.

My mom's friend, who lives in SF recommended to have dinner here instead of the restaurants in Chinatown.  She said the food here is better than the dishes in Chinatown.  We got here around 7pm and it was crowded with people having dinner.  The restaurant is pretty small, so the waiting area is tiny! There was 6 of us and we got seated right away at a tiny table that only fits 4 people and another table next to the pole that only fits 2 people.  Since we didn't mind at all because my mom's friend didn't want us to get back to sj late.  The staff was really friendly and didn't want us to be squished and be cramped having dinner so they suggested that we switch to the table near the window.  It was better than before but we were still cramped.  There was a bigger table that was being cleaned and she suggested that we move over there. that was EVEN better! \n\nOur meal turned out to be $50 with tip included.  This is what we got:\nfor appetizers:\n- salted pepper chicken wings -- fried, salty and the chicken didn't taste fresh\n- deep fried quail (2) -- cut it into smaller pieces.  you can taste that it was frozen and not much flavor\n\nmain course:\n- braised oysters and tofu with ginger and green onions - there was 6 oysters. not too much flavor. couldn't taste the ginger. where was the tofu?\n- clams with black bean sauce - the sauce was super salty and SPICY so it went well with the rice.  on the menu it didn't indicate that its spicy, but it was SPICY!!\n- string bean with pork - the beans wasn't mushy! it was crunchy! so that was good. the pork was marinated really good and the flavoring was delicious\n- sweet and sour pork with pineapple - very sour! i like how the pork was first fried then it was tossed into the sauce. delicious!\n- braised catfish with tofu and black mushroom - the fish tasted weird. too much batter. \n\nfor dessert:\n- green bean sweet soup - not too sweet, just the right sweetness! \n\nService is fast and the food came out pretty quick too.  the dishes were cheap, but i wouldn't say it WOWed me enough to come here again.  i enjoyed the food though.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

I found this little gem nearby and was was very satisfied. Here's why:\n\n1. Cheap as all get-up.\nAveraging at $5 a plate, you can't go wrong. I'm a college student, I would know. They even have dinner specials at $98 for 8-10 people. Good place to take a bunch of your stingiest buddies. Mongolian beef was a tad spicy (in a good way), but paired with the chow-mein, it made for a solid, semi-greasy lunch. \n\n2. Comfort food for the soul.\nThe portions were generous. The two of us girls couldn't finish 3 plates, so we actually called in another friend that lived nearby to help us. True story. Kinda awkward that we didn't invite him in the first place, but he was happy to eat. Problem solved.\n\n3. Service, well, it was average.\nOther reviewers commented on poor service but we didn't have a problem. Maybe because we came in for a late lunch. Maybe because we were hot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-15", "description": "When I first heard we were having Chinese New Year dinner here, I prepared my stomach for the worst. Considering that this place was cited by the Health Department in the last ten years, I was expecting to leave the restaurant disgusted and yet still hungry.  However, the new management at China First made a pretty good comeback for this little restaurant.  At least there aren't random things flying around my food anymore.  But, the bathroom still leaves a lot to be desired, but as my father once told me, a good sign of a truly authentic greasy spoon Chinese restaurant is a dirty bathroom. Anyway...\n\nFOOD:  Was actually quite good, Exceeded expectations.  The garlic eggplant had large slices of roasted garlic in it (MMMMM!!!!) and the eggplant was cooked till just tender without being overly mushy.  I liked how they added more veggies (snow peas, mushrooms, carrots) to this dish, which is normally just served with the brown glaze and pork bits.  Gave the dish both a nice texture and color.  I also had their Buddha's Delight vegetarian medley, which was nice because it was 1) arranged prettily in a lotus flower shape and 2) had lots of \"fat choy\" (seaweed that looks like thin strands of hair... supposed to bring good luck in Chinese culture) so hopefully I'll get lucky this year.  One drawback: LOTS OF GREASE.  I was happily diving into the eggplant and about to polish it off when I noticed this huge pool of grease sitting at the bottom of the plate.  Of course, it didn't stop me from eating the eggplant but I'll definitely have to think twice before making this a weekly habit.  Overall, I left the restaurant full and satisfied and am happy to say I'll be back for the eggplant...even if it's just an occasional, potential heart-attack inducing treat!\n\nAMBIENCE: Sticky floors.  Dirty but still useable bathroom as long as you toilet paper everything that you touch.  Signs of your typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant that serves surprisingly good food.  I wouldn't bring anyone other than the more adventurous non-Chinese diners or the most hardcore Chinese members of your blood-related or adopted Chinese family.  Service is...well overworked.  They'll bring the food to the table.  They'll clean your place when you're done.  They'll refill your tea or your rice pot if you leave the lid open.  Otherwise, expect a slightly annoyed look/click of the tongue if you ask them for anything else.  That's just the kind of service you get for cheap, greasy. but oh-so-satisfying Chinese food.  Great for those who are just here for the food, not-so-great for those who want to be doted on or pampered.\n\nPRICES: Very reasonable.  I mean c'mon, with the less-than-desirable ambience and service, they better make up in this department.  Less than $10 per person, including rice and tea, and you'd still have leftovers to bring home.\n\nPARKING: OH GOD.  I'm convinced that God created the Richmond district to punish San Francisco.  This has got to be the WORST place to find parking, even worse than downtown because at least DT has multi-story parking lots.  Try bussing, or carpooling at the very least.", "author": "Catherine C."}

We were basically contented but not sure if we would want to give it a try.\n\nSecond time, 2 days later we checked out the restaurant that we planned to go 2 days ago. It was still closed and we noticed a sign hanging out there saying \"coming soon\". We knew that one of our favorite restaurants was \"gone\". It was so sad. DH suggested to go to China First again. OK, let's give it one more try. We ordered the kick-ass stir-fried greens again. It's again very fresh and tasty. Instead of fried rice, we ordered a fried noodles with chicken. It's as good as the fried rice. I have hesitation to order a salt & pepper pork chops because the disappointed salt & pepper chicken wings. But, the pork chops were surprisingly delicious: not much fatty, juicy, not too salty and just the right spiciness. We knew where to bring our parents out the next time.\n\n1 week later, we came again with the whole family and the parents. Other than the \"mandatory\" stir-fried greens and Yang Zhou fried rice, we had the salt & pepper pork chops, pork stewed with pickles, chicken & corn soup, clams with black-bean sauce, fried fish, shrimps with walnuts. The greens and fried rice won the most compliments. Salt & pepper pork chops were overcooked and dry this time. Pork stewed with pickles was ok, not fatty and taste good but not outstanding. Chicken & corn soup was the kids' favorite, it is something that it should not go wrong. Clams were delicious, no the taste of soil, freshly cooked and tasted good. The fish was ok, just the soy sauce was too much and too salty but we finished all. Shrimps with walnuts were under average, the shrimps and the walnuts tasted \"old\". It seemed that they were cooked the 2nd time. Dessert was red bean sweet soup which was too sweet and too watery. However, for all these which could feed 9 people and it costs only $80 including tips, I should not complain.\n\nThe waiter service was fine, not warm but sufficient. The orders arrived fast and we did not have to wait too long for food. If you decide to go there for dinner, it is suggested to arrive before 7pm or make reservation for a big group.\n\nI know that we will come back again and again.", "author": "Roserrele W."}

We passed it again the other night and stopped in, cause we didn't have cash for the Thai restaurant next door.  The prices are SO cheap! It's almost cheaper than Houston.  We ordered the mah po tofu, which was decent (I prefer a bit more spice and crushed pork versus strips) and the salt and garlic fried cod filets.  Our meal including tax and tip was about $15 which is amazing.  They have this list of specials that are always $4.95, and you just can't beat that.

Let's get this straight first: Chinese restaurants with nice ambience always overcharge way too much for Chinese food.  I avoid these places like a plague because it's not worth it.  Chinese food isn't and shouldn't be fine dining and anyone trying present it as such is ripping you off.   Chinese food is homely and my soul food.  I come for the food.  \n\nThings you have to order:  \n\nSalt and Pepper crab\nClay Pot Rice\nAnything else\n\nThe clay pot rice is something you will not find in the menu.  It's only written on the wall but it's in Chinese.  Just ask them about it and they'll explain it to you.  Basically, it's rice that's cooked slowly in a clay pot with preserved meats such as frog legs, sausage (pork or chicken).  The rice soaks up the flavors of the meat and is really tasty.  It takes a while to make so I usually order it first thing when I get there.  \n\nAll of the other food is solid, home cooked stuff.  It's very inexpensive and has great food.  I highly recommend this place and I don't recommend a lot of Chinese restaurants.  This one stands out from the rest.", "author": "Scott L."}

The things chinese people look for in a restaurant are...1. good food - 2. good prices - 3. good menu - 4. good location.  Notice that service didn't make the list?  China First scores decently in all those areas (except location, too bad it's not closer to my house).  Their set menus are a really good deal.  They also have a list of dishes that are $3.88 each.  Why $3.88 and not $3.89?  8 is a good luck number is my guess.  Anyway, the eggplant with pork on the 3.88 list was really good.  The other stuff I've had there, the fried rice, the tofu and pea shoots, the seafood soup, the salt-n-peppa chicken wings...all good.", "author": "Ming L."}

I really don't care for this restaurant, but I really don't mind eating here...Okay, I actually do. The food is mediocre, the service is not so great, the parking is also a bitc%... what else is there...? LIST!\n\n1. Whenever I usually come here we get the welcoming from the waiters because apparently, they know my family, so we get seated really fast so that's a plus.\n2. Here comes the nasty part! They do not look at how dirty the tables and the spinning thing really is! They just wipe it down and consider that clean... are you serious?! and they don't even bother to check the utensils before handing them to us... one time I found a piece of rice stuck between the end of the forks! Can you talk about cleanliness?! The plates and cups usually have a stain on them as well, they seriously do not clean the utensils very good... and omg, if you need to use the restroom, I advise you to just HOLD IT! Escpially if you are a female, I believe you wouldnt you want to sit on this toilet seat that has pee all over it, I WOULDN'T... the bathroom stinks so bad, smells like pee and poo mixed. so lets just stay away from that okay? good. Next, the big tank of fish that they have at the back, they really don't make the fish looks so tempting to eat, honestly they just have fish in there just floating looking like they are dead. seriously. At least make it look tempting and wipe the glasses so everyone can clearly see what they are about to put into the mouths! NEXT TOPIC! If there was a category for cleanliness on this it would recieve a \" NEGATIVE 3 \"\n3. The parking on clement street is usually crazy and can you rarely ever find parking. There are also so many double parked cars in this area and the asian drivers that don't give a flying F%%% about the drivers behind loves to drive slow for their own benefits looking for parking. talk about A-HOLES?!\n4. okay, down to the good stuff. The food here is just mediocre but they actually have really good dishes. Dishes that I always order here is the Lettuce wraps with minced chicken, the deep fried sandad is so good... im not even kidding SO GOOD, the crispy skin and the tender fish meat YUM! The oysters are really tasty as well, with the black bean topping it comes with makes it have a really nice bitter taste to it, but a good taste. So overall the foods can be really great, but they can also be really bad, My personal dislikes are the sweet and sour pork, Ew... it has a nasty stench to them it makes me want to trhow up whenever they are near me. Also the salt and peper shrimp aren't as great as the salt and pepper chicken wings*!\n\n* A MUST HAVE.\n\nOverall, this place is inexpensive, and great for having a large group of 10-15, the food isn't bad nor great. Don't be suprised if you find leftover food on your table. so... 3 stars for me.", "author": "Johnny T."}

The different regions are known for different foods and styles.  You don't go to a place like China First (which is Hong Kong style or Cantonese food) and order pot stickers (which are central/northern).  You DO go to China First for some down home Cantonese classics, such as black bean clams, stirfried beef and broccoli, chow fun, tofu clay pot and the other things that people recommend.

What I'm saying is this: we sat at a dingy table behind a dirty fish tank eating almost exclusively overly salted deep-fried weirdness (except Buddha's Delight, which had seaweed so fresh it still had sand in it) and left feeling both constipated and about to have explosive diarrhea.
