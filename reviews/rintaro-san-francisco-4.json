It just melts in your mouth. The BEST!!!\n5) Fruit based appetizer - 4/5 don't know what it was but it was good.\n\nYakitori:\nchicken oyster ($12) 3/5 - It was tender and perfectly seasoned but nothing special.\nrintaro tsukune ($9) 4/5 - juicy chicken meatballs.\nchicken thigh + onion ($9) 5/5 - my favorite yakitori, that onion was so good. Just perfect with chicken thigh. highly recommended!!\n\nkama tama udon ($12) 3/5 - carbonara udon, it was very simple yet flavorful. Udon was chewy and soft. I wouldn't order it again but it's worth a try.\nmaguro no yukke ($18) 3/5 - soy marinated tuna over rice, tuna was fresh and good. \n\nOverall, this place was good izakaya place. HOWEVER, the waitress was kind of like saleswoman. She kept telling us to order more by saying that this is too little for 2 people but the portion was actually huge for us.

We ordered the maguro tuna sashimi, scallop sashimi, thigh and onion yakitori, the kabocha karokke, duck breast salad, natto don, and the mille feuille miso katsu.  They were out of the cheese tori katus which I really wanted to try.  The natto don here was delicious and tasted a lot better than natto I have had at other places. \n\nThe duck breast salad had really tender pieces of duck in it.  We also ordered the cheesecake, and the sesame ice cream.  The cheesecake was super light and fluffy, a cheesecake I could eat over and over again.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-22", "description": "A coworker of mine recommended Rintaro to me based off of places she knows I love (Ippuku, Soba Ichi). I called to make a reservation on Friday the 14th at 5:02 pm; I was put on hold for over five minutes and when the hostess came back and I told her I wanted to make a reservation for Saturday evening, if possible, she said, \"Oookaaayy, let me see what we have...\" in a tone that could only be described as exasperated and annoyed.\n\nWhen she asked my first and last name for the 6:00 pm reservation, I said, \"Angela, [brief pause] and the last name is [slowly] M as in Mary, A-R-R-U-J-O.\" The hostess replied, \"Ok, what was the first name?\" I said, \"Angela.\" She then quickly, confidently, and in the same annoyed tone said, \"And the last name is M-I-R-R-A-G-O.\" I paused so I wouldn't snap and said, \"M-A-R-R-U-J-O,\" and pronounced it (the J is pronounced as an H). She said back, \"Marrugo.\" I said, \"No. Marrujo.\" She repeated it back correctly.\n\nWhen we showed up for our reservation, my last name was Marrugo in their system.\n\nNot a good first impression.\n\nLuckily the rest of the night was markedly better. Rintaro is a beautiful restaurant: high ceilings, minimal, modern Japanese styling, light wood, and lots of natural light even into the later evening hours. The courtyard in the front of the restaurant is peaceful, and it looks like Rintaro offers lap blankets for patrons eating outdoors when the evenings get chilly.\n\nFirst things first: I highly recommend making a reservation, even if you have to deal with the unpleasant, unprofessional hostess I spoke with. Two women who walked in ahead of us tried to get a table without a reservation and were told it would be an hour and forty-five minute wait. When I called to make a reservation, the only two slots available were for 6:00 pm and 9:15 pm.\n\nRintaro's menu has an interesting, varied array of food. On Mondays, Rintaro offers yakitori tenju, and on Tuesdays they serve okonomiyaki. Their main menu changes daily. We went with the yosedofu ($10), hanetsuki gyoza ($15), mabodofu don ($14), kama tama udon ($12), nakatani no kakiage ($15), and the momotaro shukuriimu ($12).\n\nOur waitress highly suggested the yosedofu (house-made, fresh tofu), which was the first dish of the night to come out. The tofu was creamy and cold, and tasted delicious with the accompanying shoyu, ginger, and scallions.\n\nThe hanetsuki gyoza came next, which was the most visually interesting gyoza I've ever ordered. A crispy, edible layer (of what, I'm not sure) housed the gyoza and looked almost like a net, with a bunch of greens laid over the top. The menu claims this dish includes chicken feet jelly and \"wings\"; if there was chicken feet jelly in the gyoza I couldn't tell you what that tastes like, specifically, nor do I know what \"wings\" means in this context. But the gyoza were delicious and so was the dipping sauce, so I suppose ultimately that's what matters most, but I was thrown off by how vague the description of this dish was.\n\nThe nakatani no kakiage came out while we were still eating the gyoza. It was a mix of greens and scallops deep fried in tempura batter. This dish was impressive in how flavorful it was for being so simple. It's also the first time I've had scallops I've actually liked, as the scallops were sweet and not at all fishy or briny in flavor. The tempura remained light and crisp and not too oily.\n\nOur final two dishes, the mabodofu don and the kama tama udon, were very impressive and so, so good. If you like mapo tofu, you'll more than likely enjoy mabodofu don. It's essentially the same dish but doesn't contain the numbing spice of Szechuan mapo tofu. The ground pork was flavored so well and the tofu was a perfect amount of firm while still maintaining creaminess. The kama tama udon was an interesting take on pasta carbonara, with Rintaro's own hand-rolled udon served with a single egg yolk, butter, ginger, scallions, and shaved katsuobushi (or bonito flakes). Once everything was mixed together the dish really was the Japanese version of carbonara and was delicately but significantly flavorful.\n\nDessert was the momotaro shukuriimu, which was a large cream puff pastry with peach ice cream and blackberry sauce. I'm not much of a cream puff fan so my boyfriend ate the majority of it, but it was sweet and light and well baked. I focused more on the ice cream, which had large chunks of peaches, and went well with that tasty blackberry sauce.\n\nService at Rinatro was spot on. Our waitress was nice without being annoying, attentive without being overbearing, and every other waitress that came around to either bring out dishes or clear plates was informative and kind. There was little wait between dishes, and it never felt like we were sitting around waiting for our food. Everything was paced well. I also appreciated that the dish for our dessert was chilled, keeping everything from melting prematurely.\n\nI highly recommend checking out Rintaro.", "author": "Angela M."}

I also love izakayas and frequent them quite a bit in NYC and Japan when I visited.  Thankfully, I was able to make a reservation and requested the bar/chef's counter.  Not many people like smelling like smoke, but seeing the chef sear the meat, to see the busyness of the kitchen and sous chefs, it makes me appreciate my meal so much more.\n\nOne of the things that I love was the entryway: it was super quaint and well decorate - almost a modern country feel, topped with small tiny lights strung up overhead.  It would make for a perfect night out with friends for a birthday dinner, especially on a relatively warm day or even a chill night with hot sake.\n\nThings we tried:\nBeef Meatballs\nPROS:\n- great thick round meat balls: they were not skimpy\n- meat was well seasoned, very tender\n- not overly drenched with sauce: one of the things I don't like about izakayas is that they tend to put way too much sauce on their skewers\n\nCONS: \n- slightly heavy-handed on the salt\n\nCheese Katsu\nPROS:\n- nice quantity for a small plate: definitely shareable between two or three people\n- katsu was crispy, not soggy\n- not super oily\n - cheese was on the inside, came out nice and melting hot\n\nCONS:\n-none\n\nChicken Oyster\nPROS:\n- super tender, probably the most tender piece of chicken I've had\n- not overly salty\n- shareable but probably only between two people.\n\nCONS:\n- none\n\nGindara: black cod\nPROS: \n- good flavor: nice char\n- well cooked: melting in your mouth\n\nCONS:\n- way too small for the price.  I mean, these pieces were TINY.  I wouldn't get this again.\n\nChicken Shoulder\nPROS:\n- much larger cut of meat, definitely more shareable between three people\n- well seasoned (not overly salty)\n- not overly greasy or dried out (overcooked)\n\nCONS:\n- slightly more tough (but not in a bad way) compared to the chicken oyster\n\nI'd definitely come back again.

I was in SF for a conference at the end of last month, and a new friend had made a reservation here months in advance for herself. Luckily she was able to call and add me to the reservation to sit at the chefs table! \n\nI had the Suzuki No Sashimi, Iwashi No Nanbanzuke, and the Kake Udon soup. Paired with the meal, I tried two different cocktails, both of which were fabulous. (I don't remember the names!)The Suzuki No Sashimi was the perfect start to the meal, the Baja striped bass was extremely fresh. I'm a fan of anchovies and if I see them on the menu, I typically order (even on pizza lol). So I had to try the house dish Iwashi No Nanbanzuke. This dish included fried anchovies in a spicy vinaigrette topped with carrot, and I thought it was a nice way to break up the fresh fish dish and the udon soup. \n\nThe udon soup was the star of the show for me.

We ordered several skewers and they were all juicy, tender and perfectly cooked--my favorite is the chicken oysters, had to order it twice!\n\nIt seemed liked the Cheese Katsu was really really popular so we also tried it, but to me it was a big underwhelming. The cheese was melted through, which is good, but wasn't evenly distributed throughout the katsu, so some bits are packed with cheese while others weren't. Overall, not a deal breaker.  \n\nWe rounded out our dinner with Bukkake Udon and Maguro No Yukke (rice bowl) and wow what a great way to end dinner. The hand-rolled udon was thick and chewy, all the toppings (especially the fresh cherry tomato) complimented the milky broth with varying layers of flavor and texture. The tuna on the rice bowl was finely minced, fresh and milky. \n\nOverall, would 100 come back from the ambience to the food everything was perfect.", "author": "Rene C."}

I have been there at least 30 times or more and I loved every visit. \n\nThe decor is authentic. Japanese persimmon tree, Usu (traditional wooden rice cake pounding pot) and Kamado (traditional wood stove for cooking) in the front yard invite you into Showa era Japan. When you open the door, you will notice the beautiful Japanese shrine and old farm house like woodwork throughout the restaurant. I am always mesmerized by Sylvan's father's (who apprenticed as a temple carpenter in Kyoto) work.\n\nTheir Yakitori is authentic. No Japanese-American BS with teriyaki-sauce here! You will find hands down the best Stukune (chicken meatball skewers) outside of Japan. They make their Stukune the way I like... three little balls instead of one oblong pice per skewer. You get more surface area that way. Grilled well on real wood charcoal. Just like my favorite Yakitori-ya in Tokyo where my family have been eating there for over 40 years.  \n\nSashimi here is seasonal and elegantly plated on beautiful had crafted Japanese plates. Quality of the fish, attention to the detail and traditional skills shine through.\n\nAgemono (Fried food) are pleasure to eat.

We got there a bit early, but were seated immediately when we arrived.\n\nThe bar seating was super entertaining, as you're able to watch the chefs' work their magic. Just keep in mind that the bar stools here are a bit uncomfortable to sit on throughout dinner.\n\nWe ordered: yosedofu (housemade silken tofu), tuna sashimi, tsukune (chicken meatball skewers), ten layer pork katsu, mapo tofu with rice, and the hand rolled udon with fish cake. All the dishes here are on the smaller side, but we were perfectly satisfied with 6 dishes and a dessert to share.\n\nI highly recommend starting off with the tofu and chicken meatballs! I would've wanted another order of the meatballs, but wanted to pace myself during dinner. The pork katsu was nice and crispy - delicious paired with mustard! I'm not a big fan of raw fish, so didn't get to try the sashimi. The rice and udon were also mehs in my book - the rice was good, but mapo tofu isn't something I'd normally go for. The udon broth was amazing, but the fishcake had way too much edamame, imo.\n\nWe finished off the night with the japanese souffle cheesecake and they were nice enough to put a candle on it :)\n \nService here was attentive, but there was an odd lag right in the middle of our dinner where we didn't get any other dish for a solid 15 min.

Unsurprisingly, this is one of the most popular Izakaya style Japanese restaurants in the SF area, and I definitely see why. The decor of this place is stunning and really adds to the feel of the restaurant.\n\nIzakaya is basically Japanese small plates, so be prepared to be a bit adventurous! \n\nRintaro prides themselves in their skewers, which were delicious and very unique. I'd recommend trying out multiple skewers to get the full experience. \n\nWhile Rintaro doesn't have as much raw fish as I'd expect from a Japanese place, the ones I got were absolutely delicious! The yellowtail and albacore were quite exceptional. \n\nWe also ordered multiple small sides, such as the karaage (classic) and tofu. All were delicious!\n\nIf you're planning on coming here, I'd highly recommend reservations. This place gets pretty packed on the weekends, and though the place is a bit larger than it first seems, it's still not that big. The restaurant itself is even a bit hidden.

I'd never experienced an izakaya, plus I had read so many good things about Rintao on Yelp. I made a reservation for lunch online, which was a nice convenience. Rintaro is located a little out of the way north of the Mission, tucked off the street beyond a little courtyard. The interior was really nice with lots of light colored wood and a really airy, light feeling. They have outdoor seating in front as well. \n\nThe lunch menu includes 6 different lunch sets, sort of like bento boxes. Each set comes with a bunch of different sides like Korean banchan - we had miso soup, anchovies, black cod, pickled wasabi leaf, and some pickled veggies. My favorite by far was the black cod, although the flavor was really subtle. I didn't really care for any of the others besides the miso soup, which had clams in it (different than I'm used to, but good). The pickled items were pretty bland in terms of pickle flavor but odd-tasting, kind of strange. The chicken katsu was just okay. It got really soggy and the egg was just kind of congealed under the chicken. I was honestly pretty bummed as I had been anticipating this place for so long while planning my trip. We did order the Japanese fried chicken wings to share and those were really good, but they only came 3 to an order. I wish I had just ordered more of those! Service was polite and pretty prompt, and the atmosphere was unique and fun, but it didn't really make up for the food for me. From the rave reviews it seems like dinner is really the way to go here.

We made reservations online but apparently we weren't early enough to grab a table. They offered us the inside which is very cramped or the outdoor seating. It was starting to get a little chilly but they did have heat lamps and offered to turn them on. Outdoor seating was very quaint and honestly I prefer did to the indoor area but it was harder to get service if we needed anything. \n\nFor our meal we ordered the following; \n1) Suzuki Sashimi w/ fresh wasabi & ponzu: The most beautiful suzuki I've ever laid eyes on. Is contour for fish a thing? Cause if it is, that's what this must be. Every slice was beautifully cut. Bright and mild. Semi-firm and pairs perfect with the fresh wasabi and light citrusy ponzu. If you're not a sushi fanatic, the extra high pricepoint may not be worth it but if you love appreciating the a fish's natural beauty, you gotta see it in person. (4.5/5)\n\n2) Chrysanthemum, Kumquat, Duck Breast salad: A love fresh spring salad. I love using chrysanthemum leaves in salads. Their grassy herby flavor paired very well with the fatty meaty duck breast and the kumquats provide some nice relief from the duck's richness with a nice bright zing and some mild sweetness. (4.5/5)\n\n3) Chicken thigh w/ sansho: Juicy chicken thigh that's well seasoned but the sansho just didn't stand out very much for me (4/5)\n\n4) Chicken Heart: My favorite skewer of the night. So flavorful with just the perfect bite. I don't even know how to describe it. (4.75/5)\n\n5) Tsukune: A very good chicken meatball. Slightly charred outside but moist inside. Very well seasoned, almost a bit sweet. (4.5/5)\n\n6) Layered Pork Katsu w/ Black Hatcho Miso & Hot Mustard: I feel like I didn't eat this dish correctly. I didn't find a point where the hot mustard seemed to fit in the dish. I tried it throughout with the cabbage and the pork and it was fine but never seemed to fully belong. I really enjoyed the sweet tangy miso w/ the katsu. The most interesting part is definitely the texture from all the layers. Each layer was still juicy despite the fact they were really thin and it was mostly lean meat. Breading was decent but nothing special. The cabbage on the side was rather plain and I would've loved some dressing on it though I appreciate how well it was cut. Eating it gave a great mouthfeel. (4/5)\n\n7) \"Carbonara\" (Handmade Udon, raw egg, butter, ginger, scallion, hand shaved bonito): Honestly the only disappointing item of the night. It's not bad, just not what I expected. The best part was definitely the handmade noodles which had a creamy exterior and that perfect QQ bite. The other components of the dish were just there to highlight the natural flavor of the udon. Which is fine but when I think carbonara I think decadent creaminess which is definitely not this dish. (3.5/5)\n\n8) Pork ginger gyoza w/ chicken feet jelly/broth: I was debating this for so long because just how good can gyoza be. The answer? Damn friggin good. Filling was full of flavorful soup and juicy pork balanced w/ the perfect amount of ginger. The lace on the gyoza was beautiful and crispy too. My only complain is that I wish the wrap was slightly thinner and the sauce a bit lighter. (4.5/5)\n\nOverall, I left very happy with my meal and honestly the bill wasn't too bad ($70/person before tip which is well worth the quality).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-09-07", "description": "There is a LOT of hype around Rintaro. Before I came, a friend told me this was by far her favorite izakaya place in the city. My expectations were high! I love izakaya food and given my high expectations I tend not to attempt any visits unless highly recommended because I usually expect to be disappointed. And so, I have very little to compare Rintaro with in terms of izakaya spots specifically in San Francisco. Overall as an izakaya goes, it's pretty good to me, but just don't go expecting levels of what you'd get in japan. I'd say this is like \"average\" Izakaya level in japan to me.\n\nThat said, most dishes here were super solid, and a few I'd come back for. Oddly, their yakitori to me was not their best dish. As we came with a sizable group, we ordered at least half the menu. A few memorable dishes in order of how much I liked them:\n\n1: chicken katsu with cheese - perfectly crisp and fried just long enough at the right temperature that there was no greasy after taste and the cheese was nice and melted, juicy meat.\n2: curry croquette - again, fried perfectly, and the flavors worked\n3: udon carbonara - ok this isn't THAT small some pictures make this look like it's one mouthful worth of noodles but you could share it between 3 if you all just wanted a few bites for a taste. It was good. But there's no cheese in this it's really just butter and egg and dashi. Japanese flavors + butter and yolk for sure. \n4: Tsukune skewers (chicken meatballs) - by far the best of the \"standard\" grilled skewer dishes. The others were not so flavorful. Thighs were fine.\n5: okra skewers - only because I love okra! \n6: this was quite bad - leaf baked whole fish. Too dry, and the server deboning it said it was the first time she was deboning but kind of massacred the fish and left too many bones. We felt bad since she kept saying it was her first time and so didn't complain but it wasn't so good. Anyway, the meat was dry. Definitely the most disappointing dish.\n7: hojicha panna cotta is actually way up there for me but saving it for last because it's dessert. It was amazing. Flavors really came through \n8: momotaro choux cream (shukurimu is how they spell it) was underwhelming. I did not get the taste of momo (peach) at all. Which I expected since that's part of its name!! \n\nOk anyway, I wouldn't come here with a big group because there's no space up front for a group and you'll inevitably be shoved in the room at the back and it gets really stuffy and dark even when it's freezing out! I got really upset about it because I don't enjoy eating in an uncomfortable space and I was feeling stuffy and a little claustrophobic. But otherwise, food was really decent, and it just might be the best izakaya spot in the city. Temper your expectations though!

On a personal level, it's my #1 favorite restaurant in San Francisco.\n\nEverything here is AMAZING! The vibe is reminiscent of a traditional restaurant in Japan (to me at least). I've been to Japan + this place always takes me back to my time there. Staff + service is amazing, too.\n\nMy favorite thing to order for lunch is the Chiizu Tori Katsu Set. The chicken is juicy + crisp. And the Katsu sauce is traditional. Well, the entire set is traditional. For dinner, we like to order everything! Nothing on any of their menus has disappointed. \n\nKeep in mind, before making a trip over, try to make a reservation. For dinner, I believe they only accept reservations. Call + check. Otherwise, if you're walking-in, expect a long wait.", "author": "Rosa D."}

When I first moved to SF, I was so disappointed by the food BUT I now know there are pockets of cuisine worth looking out for -- one of which is Japanese izakayas. Rintaro is a gem. I will be coming back again.\n\nFirst of all, I absolutely LOVE the space. It takes me back to Japan, and the restaurant is QUITE spacious. The stand-out food we ordered were:\n\n1) Duck breast with Chrysanthemum Greens - the greens had this light bitterness and great crunch, that I think was better than the duck breast itself. Though the duck breast was cooked perfectly. Very thin slices, high quality. Beautiful presentation...\n\n2) Gyoza - I usually don't order this, partly because I just hate the spelling (knock-off of the Chinese word \"jiao zi\" but anyways...). It was SO good. It was pan-fried with a light crust on the bottom. Also beautiful presentation. \n\n3) The DRINKS. OMG. So delicious. I loved the pina colada one the most. All of them are sochu based and worth every drop. The flavors are so light and not overwhelming.\n\nOh yeah and dessert. I'd skip the panna cotta and just go for the ice cream. You can't go wrong.\n\nGreat for date-night. You can peek over the counter and watch the chefs grill over the fire. I love chef's table seats. Also good for groups of 4. Make a reservation though!", "author": "Cindy W."}

First time to try to food. \n\nFirst time I came, didn't make reservations and it was super packed and fully booked. So had to drive to another restaurant.\n\nThis time I came afternoon around 1:30pm. The place is pretty empty, no reservations needed but just in case you can still make one. The atmosphere here is very calming and relaxing. The music is not really my type, traditional Japanese music, but that's the experience right?\n\nSat down by the countertop so I can look at what they doing. It's pretty interesting! \n\nThe menu is pretty small for lunch time so we ordered 2 sets and 1 appetizer. \n\nFirst came out fried chicken! I love how they present their food. The chicken taste great, skin is crispy and a daze of sweet taste. The way they season the chicken is great, love it. 9/10 is a bit small for 12$ \n\nThen comes our entrees ! I got the Sashimi over rice set and my friend got the katsu set. Both sets came with soup and side dishes. \n\nThe soup is not just simple miso soup, it has big tofu piece and real seafood inside. \n\nThe 4 side dish is very small but delicious.\n\nThe main bowl is great, I love the sashimi over rice with REAL WASABI I can taste it's spicy but not super strong.\n\nThe katsu bowl is great I got a bite and the outside is super crunchy and inside is with cheese !!!!\n\nVery delicious meal. Love it. Will come back again to try the dinner menu.\n\n9/10 a bit pricy and crowded at night.", "author": "Sandy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-24", "description": "I enjoy Rintaro quite a bit even if I always need reservations to get in. Rintaro is one of the better izakayas in the city - largely I suspect due to just higher quality ingredients. The fact that I always have to make reservations certainly takes the spontaneity out of what a proper izakaya experience should be, but the quality of the food is quite good here. \n\nMy go tos are always their skewers of course - they have great skewers, the agadeshi tofu, and then their udon. I would avoid the sashimi pieces since I think it's too costly for the amount of food, but some of their other fried pieces are good here. I had a mille feuille style chicken the other day that was more aspirational than tasty, but hey, I appreciated the creativity. \n\nIn general, Rintaro is a great place to have a meal with a group of friends (more people more dishes) or also a nice place to grab a quick snack assuming you can find last minute seats!", "author": "Jasmine X."}

Once you step behind the fence you enter a lovely patio seating area and then into the lovely exposed wood beam restaurant with great diffused lighting. We got to sit up at the bar to watch all the kitchen at work, highly recommend if you're at all interested in how they make the plates. Sipped on hot tea while waiting for our: tofu, veggie dish with apples and spring onions, squash croquettes, chicken tender yakatori, beef curry rice, and udon carbonara.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-13", "description": "Decent upscale Japanese izakaya style; mind the larger portions (albeit delicious)!\n\nCame here with a date late Thursday night as a walk-in; we probably waited 15 min for a seat and were seated at the counter right in front of the grill for the yakitori.  \n\nVenue / Service: we were seated pretty near to the cashier and the kitchen so we experienced a lot of traffic where we were.  That being said, also means food came out quicker.  Fun to be able to watch the chefs making the food.  \n\nShungiku Kamo Sarada (hikari farm chrysanthemum greens with grilled duck breast and pluots)($16) - surprisingly a rather filling salad, especially with a good amount of grilled duck breast and a huge pile of the greens.  The pluots added crunch and a bit of acidity.  Even though we shared this, it was a lot of salad; maybe for 3+ people if you are trying to try more dishes\n\nLiver yakitori ($7) - not for everyone, but I liked it out of the three yakitori we ordered.  A little funky tasting and slightly chewy, but I found the texture and flavor interesting.  Seasoned well too.\n\nRintaro Tsukune Yakitori ($8) - yay juicy meatballs!  They give you three per stick (and 2 sticks).  Slightly crusty on the outside but not burned and very tender on the inside.  \n\nKing Trumpet Yakitori ($6) - not too oily and tough; this one was recommended by the waiter and we both liked it.  Very lightly seasoned to let the natural mushroom flavor shine.\n\nHanetsuki Gyoza (Becker Lane Berkshire pork gyoza with chicken foot jelly and \"wings\")($14) - while the dumplings are delicious, this is a rather big portion.  The pork filling was nice and juicy, the outside crispy without being too crunchy, but would probably only get this if you have a larger party or are planning on ordering less dishes.\n\nNijimasu no Shioyaki (whole salt grilled rainbow trout wrapped in a fig leaf with grated daikon and ginger)($34) - again, a massive portion, given it is a huge whole fish being served.  This dish also takes a while to prepare so there was a bit of a wait time between this course and the previous one.  Fish was beautifully cooked- firm but flaky and the fig leaf, daikon and ginger added a lot of bright notes to the fish.  Again, recommended only if you have a large group and are ordering fewer dishes.\n\nHojicha Panna Cotta (Japanese roasted green tea panna cotta with hojicha syrup and almond cookies)($10) - probably the highlight of the meal.  The panna cotta had a great, light but present roasted tea flavor and the hojicha syrup wasn't too sweet.  Not sure if you need the almond cookies but they were good anyway.\n\nIn summary, food is good, but perhaps not as conducive to sharing many plates given the large size of some of the dishes, especially if you have a small party.  Probably better for larger parties if you want to try the entrees, but perhaps smaller groups should stick to the izakaya and smaller dishes so you won't walk away feeling too stuffed.", "author": "Audrey H."}

First thing when walking in is how cozy and beautiful the place is. You can't see anything from the outside until you walk through the door which you'll land in the outdoor area. Nicely decorated with light strings above. The best part is they offer blankets if you choose to sit outside. The inside is just as good! The exposed wooden arches above just sells the place. \n\nWe sat outside since we were walk-ins and had no problem with being next to the heater and a few blankets to keep warm! Service was great and attentive. Our waitress was pretty informative as some of the dishes I was unfamiliar with. \n\nStandout dishes to me were the fresh tofu with yuzu, udon soup, all the yakitori dishes were delicious. I mean anything grilled on a stick is gonna taste good, right?! \n\nThey also have special requests if you ask ahead of time. If you ask if they have anything off menu, chances are they might have something! We saw a few tables with dishes that were definitely not on the menu and confirmed with our waitress. \n\nDefinitely coming back here. I'd love to have an event in the patio area.

Stay away from the natto (fermented bean dish), though, unless you are into trying something very different (but very common in Japan)- it has a very distinct taste.

I'm not sure if it has a Michelin star or if it even wants one, but it deserves one.\n\nThe space is beautiful. I love the combination of an old reclaimed warehouse with very modern Japanese style seating and decoration.\n\nI came here with my 3 year old daughter for a Friday lunch. The lunch menu's pretty rigid. I got the \"mille feuille\" tonkatsu and it was a ridiculously fancy take on a classic. The pork was super fatty (maybe even Kurobuta?), sliced insanely thin, put back together with a light egg batter, and then breaded and deep-fried. Then there were about 5 little side accompaniments -- like a little picked fish thing, a radish thing, something with seaweed salad -- all super yummy.\n\nMy daughter loved the tonkatsu, the white rice, and a Japanese melon soda we got. She doesn't have soda much so it was a very special experience for her.\n\nBut beyond the food was the service. I know bringing a 3 year old to a fancy restaurant is pretty risky but all the service people took it in stride and loved how open my daughter was to new experiences. And then to me, all the niceties of fine dining happened -- The chef came by to check on us, our waitress came at the end and had a real conversation about how we enjoyed our meal and expressed an interest in our story and my daughter's experiences with Japanese food.\n\nHighly recommend.

Fortunately, there was an okonomiyaki popup that they do which made for sort of a beer garden type atmosphere.  There wasn't much to choose from for the popup, but at least it left us with something.  Taste-wise, it was good, but I didn't get any sense of meat in mines which I thought I had.

Was so looking forward to this. Guess I gotta stick to the south bay for oden... Damn.\n\nHow weird is this? The hot towel (oshibori) the waitress gave us, she told us to use as our napkin too. What the shit is that? A cold wet towel I've already rubbed my filthy hands all over is not what I want as a napkin.\n\nHandmade udon! Haven't had this since my favorite place for that in Torrance started using store-bought udon (and I consequently stopped going).\n\nWas disappointed it wasn't nearly as good here, though. Just glad the carbonara had no cream or peas in it (pet peeve of mine is people who think carbonara is a cream sauce with peas). The udon with white wine clam sauce at Musha in West LA is the best wafu udon I've ever had and is consistently good.\n\nYosedofu (house-made tofu) $10 - I've had this many places and this was fine but did not stand out. \n\nGyoza was not on the menu but they had it. If we hadn't overheard the waitress at another table we wouldn't have known. Wish she would have told us too.\n\nThey turned out not great, though. They were shaped like Chinese dumplings, but a kind I don't like, and had a dough \"skirt\" (like Squeeze Burgers' cheese skirt), which is a thing in some regions of China that just isn't for me. When I want Chinese dumplings I'll go to a Chinese restaurant - preferably in NY, HK, or LA, not SF. When I order gyoza I want Japanese dumplings.\n\nYakitori are 2 skewers per order, which imho is too many because I want to try a bunch of them and this way I only have room for half what I normally could order. There were 2 not on the menu, tail (pope's nose or parson's nose if you're British - \"Open this door! We're British!\"), which was just okay, a little dry, and soft bone, which was really crunchy and hard to eat and had small bits of dried out meat clinging to it.\n\nThe regular chicken meat we had (thigh with onion, oyster) was too dry.\n\nLiver: the sauce was too sweet. This is better at Gaku.\n\nKanzuri (throat) was our favorite. Chewy, fatty, lots of umami. Probably too \"gristly\" for the average unadventurous American.\n\nThe Rintarou plum and lemon soda was really sour. Is it umeboshi plum? The paper straw was really think and got too soggy to use after 2 sips.\n\nThis was a 2-2.5 for food but the waitress was great and i want to differentiate it from Nihon Whisky's 2, so a 3 it is. But don't mistake this for a pure 3.\n\n~\n\nUpdate: the food was meh enough that I was going to give it a 2 (\"meh\" rating according to Yelp's own descriptions of star levels) but it wasn't as bad as Nihon Whisky Lounge and I wanted to delineate the difference using my star ratings so it got a 3. But then the owner or manager or whoever of Nihon Whisky was so unprofessional in their response to me that I bumped them down to a 1. I was going to come back and give Rintarou a 2, but now that I think about it, the waitress went out of her way to help track down a missing order after last call, so I can't in good conscience bump Rintarou down another notch.

You are not charged the $25 unless you flake. \n\nhighlights were everything. the house tofu is amazing. the gyoza is so good and we were about to pass because.. well.. you know... how good can gyoza be? good. \n\nI would pass on the chicken thigh, both of them, it was whatever. The knee was okay. If i were to be picky those would be my choices as to what to skip. \n\nThere are 2 katsus and you'll want to pick the cheesy one.

The chef even gave us some free sample to us (a couple slices of the grilled duck breasts that were sitting in front of us waiting to be cut). Thanks chef!\n\nWe started with the scallops sashimi, and what a way to start our meal. It was unbelievably fresh!! Next, we had the special salad with deep fried Dungeness crab... the crab was fried nicely (very light) and it was tasty too. \n\nOn to the yakitori section, I think we had almost everything on the menu: tsukune (chicken meatball), thigh and onion, liver and roast garlic, chicken oyster, knee cap, king trumpet mushroom, kanzuri (chicken bit between the heart the liver), and the ribeye. Everything was grilled to perfection and seasoned perfectly. Some of them were a little salty and some of them were a little sweet. My favorites were the thigh and onion, liver and garlic, ribeye, and the chicken oyster. \n\nNext we had the fried chicken wings and the gyoza. Wow, they were both so delicious and perfectly prepared. The gyoza had this really nice crispy crust on top... what a nice presentation! The battered on the chicken wings were so flavorful, and they were fried to perfection (not greasy at all).\n\nOkay... we are almost at the end of our meal. We had the whole steamed fish with sake, soy and mirin. For me this was just okay. I thought the sauce was too sweet. I wanted more salt or soy flavor. Our grand finale before dessert was the kama tama udon aka udon \"carbonara\". I thought it was pretty good. The udon was nicely cooked..chewy and slippery. The egg and the butter gave the dish the richness of a carbonara, but it was still pretty light. Overall, it was a nice comforting dish to end our meal.\n\nFor dessert we have the roasted green tea panna cotta. It was a wonderful dessert. Nice texture and unique flavor.", "author": "Sam M."}

Finally, a great izakaya that I can return regularly, with delicious skewers and small bites to fill your stomach little by little with the progression of the meal. \n\nSit in the main dining room where natural wood booths and skewer bar seats line the two sides of this long dining area. Good lighting/ambience and great service. \n\nThe skewers are excellent. Some are a bit too salty for my taste (gizzard) but for the most part solid. My favorites were chicken heart, chicken liver, chicken thigh with scallion, and King trumpet mushroom which was very moist and flavorful (unlike most other mushroom skewers I had in the past). \n\nWe had also rintaro tsukene (meatball), asparagus and bacon (the asparagus was a bit too big for skewers in my opinion) - I don't really care for these. But the plain asparagus ones that they have in March 2018 was really good - can be seasonal in terms of quality. The kneecap, neck and tail were pretty good but a bit too much tendon / chewy for my taste. \n\nThe chrysanthemum salad with duck was quite delicious - unusual greens and good quality meat. But salads are not the specialty here and according to one regular who is here, describe them to be a bit too saucy. \n\nWe also had the tomago (hot egg omelet) which everyone bragged to us here (it's served off the menu, only available some of the time). It was pretty good and very tender and moist. Make sure that you try it with the daikon with soy sauce to add a bit more flavor. I myself prefer chawamushi (not served here) when it comes to egg-related Japanese dishes. \n\nThe chicken wings are amazing. I tried one from the person sitting next to us at the bar (my colleague whom I randomly bumped into!). It was just the perfectly cooked wings with crispy skin, moist meat, and balanced spices on the outside. It doesn't get better than this when it comes to wings. \n\nIf you are in the mood for sashimi, there is a toro dish with chutoro, otoro, and California blue fin tuna. Great quality.\n\nThe yutofu (silken tofu with maitake, shimeji mushroom, Napa cabbage, etc) was pretty good but it's not a brothy soup, the hot water is only to keep it warm. Solid but not the best. Very clean food. Your stomach and body will thank you for it. \n\nThe kake udon with soft boiled egg and fish cakes were pretty good. I liked the udon but some of the other specialty udon places have more flavorful broth than the version here.", "author": "Rebecca C."}

We were seated right by the door, so the line was essentially next to our table. It did feel a little awkward because we felt pressured to finish faster. \n\nDrinks: sake/wine only, no liquor. The sake pours were a lsmaller than I expected for the price. Nonetheless, the food is best with sake. \n\nFood: I think most dishes are good for 2 or 4 people to share if everyone wants to try a little. \n- Hotate sashimi: think sliced, super sweet and tender. Soy sauce and wasabi come on the side \n- Yosedofu: assemble on your own. It's a pretty sizable piece of tofu, and the texture was very smooth but dense and still a little firm. Soy sauce, bonito flakes, and ginger come on the side \n- King trumpet mushrooms (skewer): good flavor \n- Chicken breast skewers: 2 per order and pretty filling. They were tender; however, they didn't get quite the same char as some other places (I'm thinking of the one at Sumika..) \n- Kabocha karokke: nicely fried, a huge portion, served with tonkatsu sauce. \n\nWe were actually both very full after this, so we skipped the rice and udon dishes. Again, I think it's best to go with 2-4 people so that everyone can try different things. \n\nI'm not sure I would make Rintaro a destination from the peninsula, but the food was all pretty solid. Next time, I would probably skip the skewers. They had a wagon wheel cheese + chicken katsu dish that sounded interesting. \n\nOther notes: \n- The patio area is really nice on a warm day \n- Parking is hit or miss around here\n- I think servers aren't specifically assigned to tables, but everyone steps up to help out with service", "author": "Marilyn T."}

So when I found out there was a place that stuffed its chicken katsu cutlets with ooey gooey melted Cowgirl Creamery Cheese, I made plans to go. \n\nWe got the gyoza, the katsu con queso (not called that so don't order it that way), the millefeuille pork katsu, the udon carbonara and some sides of rice (because the katsu unfortunately doesn't come with rice and I NEED rice).\n\nThe gyoza was really tasty however given that it's almost the same price as the CHEESE STUFFED FRIED MEAT CUTLET, next time I go I will be ordering katsu on katsu. The millefeuille katsu was equally delicious though I would prefer it sans hot mustard and with the traditional katsu sauce. The udon carbonara was really simple and delicious (a little too small but I love heaping mouthfuls of noodles so that's probably a personal issue). \n\nI did have my heart set on chicken heart skewers but they weren't on the menu that night :( \n\nStill, best katsu I've had in SF.

As soon as we walked into the front gates, we knew we were in for a treat. The lighting on the outside patio, the cute booths inside, sliding doors in the bathroom, all set the mood for a delightful evening.\n\nFirst, we started the meal with the sashimi moriawase and house-made silken tofu in hot water.\n- Each piece of sashimi melted in our mouths and we were all passive aggressively fighting for each last piece. \n- The tofu was creamy, and flavorful with the toppings + ponzu on the side.\n\nSecond, we ordered yakitori, chicken wings, and the 16 layer katsu. Again, jaw dropping plates. The first person to try each dish was quick to announce to the table that everyone needed to get in, fast.\n- My favorite skewer was the chicken oyster, super tender and juicy + I liked that our server told us it's the part of the chicken in-between the thigh and butt haha.\n- The chicken wings are cooked perfectly and have all the highlights of karaage but better.\n- The katsu is made fit for a king, from the intricate layers to the hot mustard on the side, to the refreshing cabbage salad\n\nNext, we ordered all of our final plates. Half of us ordered the mabotofudon and the other half ordered the kake udon with a hot spring egg.\n- The mabotofudon was super comforting and had chunks of braised pork with a spicy sauce. yum!\n- The udon is made with hand-pulled noodles and the egg... perfectly cooked with a custardy yolk.. Get the egg!! \n\nLastly, we ordered the hojicha panna cotta and the souffle cheese cake.\n- The panna cotta was awesome. I wish I could drink the hojicha syrup our of a jar. Intense roasted tea flavor with the right amount of sweetness.\n- The cheesecake was fluffy, creamy, and far from your traditional new york cheese cake.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-01", "description": "I have sort of a conflicted relationship with izakaya-style (essentially Japanese gastropub or tapas-style small bites) restaurants. On one hand, I like getting to sample a variety of dishes and it's great for sharing among a group. On the other hand, prices are almost always excessive compared to portion size, and I often end up feeling slightly underfed, ripped-off, or both. Rintaro largely manages to sidestep that conflict for me by making up for it with amazing ambiance, presentation, and menu selection.\n\nThe restaurant is hidden away behind a very non-descript gate, but walk inside and you instantly feel like you've been transported into a cozy, relaxing bistro in Japan. The decor all feels very natural with bamboo fences, interesting plants, and elegant light wood-focused interior design that looks like it was taken straight from Japan. Even the bathroom locks with a nice sliding wooden bar, which I thought was a cool touch.\n\nAs for the food, you really can't go wrong in ordering. I tried the yosedofu (incredibly clean-tasting), thigh, chicken oyster (highly recommended), and liver yakitori, teba no karaage (fried chicken), pork katsu, kama tama udon (\"carbonara\"-style without broth), and the panna cotta for dessert (very interesting texture, almost egg-like with mild syrup poured over and seeping into it, great for sharing). I'll only say that the udon was a little underwhelming for the price, but the yakitori and fried dishes really hit the spot. Sadly they were out of croquettes, but I'll have to try those next time.\n\nThis place would be a great choice for a date or a small group (ideally four). It's busy and small enough to feel lively, but the tables are separated enough and the noise level is well-suited for boisterous conversation without having to shout. Rintaro is definitely a gem in the SoMa/upper Mission area, and after dinner you can pop in next door at Nihon Whisky Lounge (provided you have cash to burn, but that's a topic for another review).", "author": "Terry L."}

This spot might be affectionately known as the place to which restaurants go to die.  Where as the renditions come and go the most noteworthy aspect in your short memory is what was there before.  Not so much what is there now.  And as a consequence of you and everybody else thinking thusly it's only a matter of time.\n\nThis, my friends, is not such a space.  \n\nBecause you-know-who is on it we respected the tradition of those without reservations and arrived early and earnestly waited outside looking forlorn and humble in a totally honest way and hoping that maybe just maybe there'd be a spot for us.  Moments before the clock struck the hour there were other parties entering the garden looking like people that actually had reservations and I was all creeping sadness mixed with the feeling that I'd been here before but when.\n\nAnd it wasn't until today after reading many pretty uniformly excellent experiences recounted and then going back almost a decade in my recollection (which is way hard) and I realized that the place I told rabbit was near here was actually once indeed really here it was Chez Spencer and I had visited years before it burned down in 2013 with different friends.  I may have known this but if I did the recollection litters the floor of the canyon that has always existed between my short and long term memory.  You'd think by now that the canyon would be full of what I've forgotten and new memories could just walk across their fallen forebears from the short term space to the forever remember space but no that isn't how it works.\n\nTo the earlier point, this is not the place restaurants go to die.  It's the opposite.  This is a place they (and you) come to live.\n\nAs we were unreserved we only had 90 minutes at the table and I was all gee that's a lot of time we shouldn't have troubles with this at all and then.  Then we started tasting what they had prepared and I wanted to stay all night.\n\nChicken thigh skewers, paper thin halibut sashimi on leaves w accompaniments and a little sauce.  Udon.  Rice dish.  I should have taken better notes.  The menu changes.  The food was delicious.  The setting is sublime.  The experience is well-staffed and the people that will be assisting you are invested in your satisfaction.  Beer and sake no full bar but daydrink options abound nearby so worry not, my friend.  I would recommend the reservations, however, because there will be evenings where even the most honest plaintive look will not get you in the door.  For as there are more well informed and better prepared people in this world than me, and they'll have seen to that little detail and snatched up that spot your sadface might have otherwise attained..", "author": "Markus N."}

A trademark of Japanese cuisine is that it doesn't feel heavy as it sits in your stomach.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-01-22", "description": "We ate at Rintaro our last night out in San Francisco earlier this year. It's pretty much right next to the freeway overpass, and this part of the neighborhood definitely has an industrial feel to it. The restaurant itself doesn't really stand out on a very quiet street, although once you step in, you find yourself in a very nice outdoor space that feels Japanese but is contoured with the industrial surroundings, and an indoor area that has high ceilings with warehouse fixtures - and then had a cozy Japanese restaurant's interior overlaid on it, giving you a spacious yet intimate setting. We sat in the back room, which is maybe more for reserved parties; this felt like a bit of an extension and didn't have the same airiness or modern, sleek feel that the rest of the restaurant did. I did appreciate the service, where food came out as quickly as it was served. The drinks here were a bit more limited, though. None of the Japanese beers (even the crafts) were ales, really leaving you only with very traditional lager flavors. One of our friends was a bit disappointed in the lack of unfiltered sake.\n\nIf anything, the drinks menu was a bit of an indication about how I felt about the whole meal - while there were a broad variety of items, the menu, particularly when it came to larger-type dishes, was surprisingly limited. I'd arguably say that the best thing I ate here were the karaage-style chicken wings, which had an absolutely delicious fry done on them and were marvelously crunchy and flavorful. The yakitori was okay but not that remarkable...we went a little off the beaten path in term of chicken parts and did the shoulder and the kneecap. The kneecaps were of varying quality - namely, some did not have all of the bones removed - making it a little adventurous to eat. The shoulders were a bit overcooked and basically came off as tougher version of chicken wings. On my 'main' courses, I will say that I did enjoy going for the more fusion-style carbonara udon, which was able to really soak up the egg and the parmesan to make it a well-done Japanese interpretation of an Italian pasta dish. Then I went with the natto...I love this dish that virtually everyone else hates, but for $9, it was served with umeboshi  and mustard - what are the chefs thinking? The flavors are just set up to clash with each other and make you wonder what you are eating...I stuck with eating the beans by themselves, which, while good, certainly did not warrant the vast markup over the frozen kind sold in stores.\n\nIn all, there were enjoyable parts of the meal, and other parts that were a bit wanting. I loved the ambiance but didn't love what came across as the lack of variety relative to other izakaya spots I have eaten at. I might come back to see if there's something that I missed, but I would probably try a different Japanese spot in town first before returning.", "author": "Asuka N."}

Adding some ginger and soy sauce made it a very refreshing dish. \n-Kabocha croquette (!!): this dish does not exist on the menu, and you'll only be offered this if you explicitly say that you're vegetarian and are looking for sth to eat.

If you're not in love with natto, I don't know if this is worth it\n-Houjicha Panna Cotta: I felt this was a little too sweet. You can taste the tea flavor, but I would have liked it better if it was less sweet but more tea-like. \n\nAll in all, a solid 4.5 stars for me, -0.5 for the limited vegetarian items.

Seems like they were reserving a lot of tables, though, as we took the last one for 2. Rintaro has 3 seating areas: outside patio in the front, main room by in the middle, and a back room. \n\nThe menu is very detailed and contained a lot of terms that we weren't familiar with. Luckily, our waiter was really nice and recommended a few dishes for us. Aside from the udon and donburi options, the other items are small plates and are meant to share. \n\n- Yellowtail sashimi: Standard sashimi, so it was good. \n- Croquettes: these were pretty good! One serving comes with 2 large croquettes. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside - also comes with a good sauce that makes it so flavorful!\n- Gyoza: So delicious, you cannot go wrong with dumplings! Comes with a dipping sauce.\n- Skewers: we ordered a few skewers (each serving comes with 2 skewers). The waiter recommended all of them to us: mushrooms, chicken breast, chicken oysters and chicken meatballs. I think the skewers were my least favorite part of the meal. There wasn't anything really special about them. The mushrooms and chicken meatballs were good. The chicken oysters were also good but were considered to be deluxe and I just didn't think it was that special. The chicken breast, however, was by far the worst dish. It was very bland and dry. \n- Profiterole: This was our dessert and it was actually one of my favorites. It is a cream puff stuffed with a large scoop of ice cream. It was yuzu-flavored and very well done. Not too citrusy, not too sweet. The cream puff was baked perfectly (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside) and the ice cream was so flavorful. Definitely a good way to end the night. \n\nOur bill ended up being ~$100 total for the both of us, which isn't horrible, but I wasn't extremely full after either.

On that list is the yakitori from Izakaya Rintaro, so naturally she added this place to our calendar of food adventures and made a reservation. Let me summarize this review by saying that Nina and I actually had a debate at the end of our meal about whether we should give this place 2 or 3 stars. I've settled in the middle with 2.5 stars only because I thought the food was excellent, but I would not come back here again if it keeps up their horrible and awkward service.\n\nWhen I first arrived, I was not greeted. Not that I'm trying to be pretentious about this, but I made eye contact with several waitresses, and they all ignored me. Fortunately it was easy to find Nina, sitting at the barstool area. I'll also take this moment to note that the chairs were small and uncomfortable, even though I'm a relatively tiny person. The plus side of the restaurant setup is that they have a beautiful front courtyard with seating.\n\nAs for food, we checked yakitori off our list. Our selections included Rintaro Tsukune, Thigh and Onion, and Chicken Oyster. These were super fresh and made right in front of us. Delicious! We also got the Kama Tama Udon, which is udon carbonara with ginger, scallion, butter, and shaved katsuobushi, topped with a freshly cracked raw egg. This was a small portion but still tasty. The textures and mixture of flavors were on point.\n\nBack to the service. Nina and I are generally patient people and try to understand that restaurants get busy, but there were SO many staff members working there, and it took at least 15 minutes for anyone to ask about drinks or generally make us feel welcome. Perhaps it's the hands-off culture of the place. Who knows? Then once our cocktails were brought, it felt like another 15 more minutes to gather our food order. \n\nDuring our meal, I felt uncomfortable when the waitresses kept reaching over me without my permission to clear dishes and wipe the table unnecessarily. I appreciate the attempt at service, but it was done with zero tact. Is it too much to ask for basic human interaction? And as predicted, it took forever to get the bill. I could spend hours talking to Nina, but something about the experience at this restaurant screamed sleepy and slow. It was so miserable having to be here for so long and sitting in this uncomfortable chair.

Generally this was the perfect amount of food, and it was paced really well.  There was always Something on the table.  I found that the flavors were quite mild, and found myself wishing I had some kind of hot sauce to add some kick.  Everything was solid, but not particularly memorable.  I found izakaya yuzuki to have more memorable dishes, as well as Nomica which is a bit further afield from izakaya but has some elements of it.  But overall a solid meal.

The menu has several fresh cuts of fish, fried chicken, lots of delicious udon and rice options. The pork appetizer was especially  delicious. Their fried chicken wings are popular and though fried well the seasoning was akin to but less appealing than the Korean sweet sauce version. A very diverse kitchen with few Asians, which is unique from most Japanese restaurants, and reflected in the dishes with delicious combinations of fusion cuisine.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

Totally exceeded my expectations, and one of the only places worth the price IMO. Its high walls and relaxed but upscale ambiance also made you feel like you were elsewhere (aka not in the middle of janky Mission/SF), which is awesome.\n\nWe made a reservation for a table of 8, seated outside on an unusually warm SF evening and started off with some light and refreshing yuzu chuhai (perfect for the summer) and yakitori. Highlights included:\n-- gyoza - off the menu, crispy, meaty, and flawlessly seasoned, no skimping on stuffing here\n-- plum wine - housemade once a year, limited in quantity but exquisitely tart and fresh\n-- kama tama udon - hand made carbonara udon with fresh raw egg, butter, ginger and katsuobushi flakes\n\nTo top off, the service was delightful (yes, actually delightful). Will have to come back for the sashimi options and am super excited to have finally found a place perfect for visitors/parents.", "author": "Anna H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-28", "description": "This is currently my most favorite Kaiseki style dining in America, beating out the contenders in Manhattan. Disguised as an izakaya place, it actually has the dishes laid out in Kaiseki sequence, but you have the option to pair it however you like, which makes it more flexible because I know what I do and do not care for in a Kaiseki set menu: no to the veggies and soup, double up on sashimi and grilled goods. \n\nThere has never been a place that made me miss Japan as much as this restaurant. The court yard waiting area looked like a small zen garden. Once inside, it has a very solid wood feel to the decor and table settings, the grills are right within eyesight.\n\nExceptional sashimi, grilled odd pieces, the last dishes (aka the rice and noodles) should be consumed up front because it's super delicious to save it to the end. But the best thing to get is the whole fish. Totally blew my mind. Gyoza is better than most Chinese dumplings but not as good as some of the best ones I've had in Asia, but definitely close to being at the top tier. \n\nThere are practically nothing bad there, just that you should not miss the dessert as it's lovely. I had so much to say about this place but I didn't want to say too much. I prefer to have everyone else think this is just okay, a mediocre place, so that it does not get mobbed like the rest of the crowd pleasers. \n\nThis is legit. I learned it from my Japanese friend who learned it from her Japanese friend. I have a few of those establishments under my belt to compare with, some are Michelin star restaurants in New York. I can say with a straight face that this is no ordinary craft.\n\nI know a good one when I see one. This is a keeper, a serious eatery that deserves more than five stars if I could reassign the rating system.\n\nI already have three friends I've promised to take here. Not so much about showing off my favorite spot, but because there are a few more (not many, mind you, we ordered 20 different things the last time we were here) dishes that I've not tried.

I've been here twice for dinner so far, and I predict more visits are in my future because of the delicious food, delightful service, and beautiful atmosphere. And great sake.\n\nI've been to Japan several times, and one of the things I love most about Rintaro is how it transports me back there. Walk into their courtyard and you feel like you've stepped into Japan. The interior is gorgeous, and I love watching the activity in their open kitchen.\n\nIn terms of the food, the handmade udon is a particular highlight. I'd never tried udon before because I thought it would be bland (e.g., compared to soba), but the server on our first visit recommended it highly. I'm so glad I took her advice because it was absolutely beautiful. So tender and flavorful! The broth is outstanding as well, and I really appreciate it being fish-based instead of pork-based. Out of our two visits, the only thing we didn't care for was a salad that was overpowered by a miso dressing (hence 4 stars instead of 5). \n\nThe service here is kind and thoughtful, which I really appreciate. For example, I love sake, so on our first visit I asked for a recommendation from the sake menu. Our server proceeded to double-check all her notes on our order first, then gave me a couple choices based on what we had picked - and the recommendation was just perfect!\n\nI strongly recommend Rintaro for a special night out - especially if you miss Japan like I do!", "author": "Julie C."}

I think some izakaya in the country has a more serious vibe to it, where chefs/owners are trying to make it more fancy than what an izakaya needs to be.

The dipping sauce (mori-tsuyu) was a great pairing with the fish, I literally ate most of it by myself...\nTeba No Karaage $9 - Japanese fried chicken wings. Super delicious as well, highly recommended. I could have probably eaten ten wings by myself too. Me and fried foods :(\n\nRintaro Kare Raisu $10 - serving for one person. Rice and Niman Ranch beef curry with apple, potato, carrot, and hot spring egg. I don't think I got the egg :( Or maybe it was cleverly hidden in the dish. This was underwhelming and really simple. So simple that I can (and have) made it at home. The beef was good, but two little pieces? I don't think I'll order it again.\n\nKama Tama Udon $8 - serving for one person. Boyfriend's favorite of the night. Simple take on the carbonara with hand-rolled udon, raw farm egg, butter, ginger, daikon, and spicy cod roe. Crack the egg into the udon, and swirl it around. The simplified version of this dish is a common Japanese breakfast item with raw egg, rice, and soy sauce - one of the boyfriend's favorite. He thought the carbonara version lacked a little more seasoning so he asked one of the chefs for shoyu and was given a similar mixture. It was so much better after that!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-01-03", "description": "With their popularity as high as ever, izakayas of nearly every ilk are spread across the Bay Area.  There are the traditional (Izakaya Mai), the newer generation (Izakaya Sozai), and the posers (the now-defunct Izakaya Ju-Ku).  As for Izakaya Rintaro?  More of the trendier, hipster-ish variety, but no less delicious.  Even if they are a little pricier than most izakayas I've been to...\n\nAlthough their location leaves a bit to be desired (the block isn't sketchy, but it's pretty dark/dead), the restaurant itself is a real gem - a well-lit, open patio that gives way to a dark, cozy restaurant space.  While sitting outside would've bee fine, I was stoked that we snagged the last two seats at the counter/bar (there are some tables/booths inside as well).  \n\nAs for the menu, it changes fairly regularly, though there are a handful of staples (like the Teba No Karaage) that consistently appear.  The range of offerings is similar to that of other izakayas, but the ingredients/products used are of better quality than most.  More importantly, everything tasted great!\n\n-- INGEN NO KURUMI AE - Dirty Girl French Beans with Rich Walnutty Sauce...$8 (small)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=JQqoU-v0ki0KfVTLaq3mYw)\nFor what it's worth - I thought this was \"good but not great\", yet this was one of my friend's favorites.  The taste of it wasn't bad at all, I just wasn't super high on the nuttiness of the sauce.  While it added a sort of creaminess, it also felt like it was covering up the beans.\n\n-- LIBERTY DUCK SKEWER...$8\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=oSEZzFjp7P_VKOS8uFGjTg)\nTasty, but definitely pricey.  Although the coloring was a little dark, the meat was juicy (the bit of fat and skin on it helped) and full of that luscious, duck flavor.  The only thing missing?  More of the crisped up duck skin.  A great skewer choice, otherwise.\n\n-- CHICKEN BREAST + WASABI SKEWER...$7\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=J13S4YQOVGT7rPtUn-IzZg)\nThe least interesting part of our meal, though it wasn't bad.  The breast was decently moist, and I liked the kick from the wasabi.  However, it's very basic - lightly seasoned chicken and wasabi.  Given that, despite the dish's lack of flaws, $7 is a bit hefty for just two skewers.\n\n-- GINDARA SUNOMONO - Cucumber and Miso-cured Bolinas Black Cod in Sweet Vinegar with New Ginger...$13\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=E0KGpWNxifOjHA7JorIowA)\nBlack cod is one of my favorite foods and this one was done really well.  The fish had that wonderful silkiness to it and tasted so good.  What's more, the cucumbers and vinegar added a sweet acidity that complemented the fish quite nicely.  I just wish we had a bigger piece!\n\n-- TEBA NO KARAAGE - Japanese Fried Chicken Wings with Smokey Tare, Sanshio Pepper and Curly Cress...$9 (small)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=650cn3z4uAwfXRVW6nCSSg)\nThe one dish we knew we had to get and it didn't disappoint...mostly.  The wings (piping hot and moist) were coated with a light batter that had a terrific crispiness to it.  However, while the overall taste was great, it could have used more of the sauce to enhance the sweet/salty contrast.\n\n-- TEUCHI UDON - Hand-Rolled Udon with Two Fishes Broth, Scallions and Nori (with Hot Spring Egg added)...$9 (+$2)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=6tV1tb-WaN_ZID4dTDD0bQ)\nSimple, but really good.  The noodles had the perfect bite to them and, while not necessary, the egg added a wonderful richness.  Still, the broth was the star - a lot of delicious, subtle flavors yet not a lot of fishiness.  The best udon I've had in SF, though I wouldn't have objected to some tempura.\n\n-- HOJICHA PANNA COTTA - Japanese Roasted Green Tea Panna Cotta with Hojicha Syrup and Sesame Almond Cookies...$9\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/izakaya-rintaro-san-francisco?select=YGnfpb3Dhvh1XGSDRY_s2A)\nWhat a way to end our meal!  As with several of our dishes, the flavors were delicate, but no less robust.  The panna cotta had a strong taste of green tea and the syrup added the perfect amount of sweetness.  Plus, I loved the taste and crunchiness of the cookie.  GET THIS.\n\nWhile I can see why some would say Izakaya Rintaro's prices are a bit high, only the skewers felt \"pricey\" to me, as the rest felt somewhat justified.  If you're still concerned though, I might suggest avoiding the skewers and sticking with their specialty dishes.  And the dessert.  Whatever you do, get the dessert!  That alone would be reason enough for me to come back.", "author": "Mike L."}

The interior is very warm and welcoming, but at the same time looks pretty sleek. There is a bar where people can sit facing the chefs as well as booths. There's an outdoors courtyard with lights strung across which is pretty and contrasts with the slightly ghetto surroundings haha.\n\nWe sat at the bar so we were able to watch one of the chefs prepare dishes. The chef gave us a complimentary sashimi (the one that we didn't order) which was very much appreciated! When he gave us our dishes, he also told us which dip/sauce was which.\n\nWe tried the silken tofu, both types of sashimi that they offered that day, the salmon roe rice, chicken karaage, liberty duck skewer, another chicken/onion skewer, and the green tea panna cotta. Honestly, everything tasted amazing, but the standout dishes to me were the silken tofu and the green tea panna cotta. The silken tofu tasted very refreshing and you add sauce to your tasting. I also really enjoyed eating the green tea panna cotta - the sauce that they give you is honey like but not too sweet. Since it's on the side, you can also add however much you want for those who don't like their desserts too sweet! The green tea flavouring was delicious. Definitely will get that dessert again on my next visit.\n\nWe also had the sake flight. The waitress told us the order in which we were to drink it, and I really enjoyed the first one. It had some floral overtones and was really smooth. The other two were also quite smooth but definitely didn't have the floral tones like the first one did.\n\nThis is a very nice place kind of hidden in a more ghetto area of SF, but definitely worth checking out.", "author": "Theresa L."}

The sashimi was very good, but they give you a very small portion of wasabi. We ordered another but never received it. The wasabi was awesome. Everything else was pretty good, but nothing stood out. And the portions are quite small.\n\nDessert was a roasted green tea panna cotta. I normally love panna cotta, but this just wasn't for me.

As a walk-in single diner, I was happy to be seated right away (even at 7pm) at the counter overlooking the open kitchen. Even without the food, it was entertaining enough just to sit there and watch the chefs work - grilling meat skewers over the yakitori flames, breading and dousing whole fishes at the fry station, preparing majestic mounds of duck salad, etc. Additionally, as noted by other Yelpers, all of the design in the restaurant is very visually appealing and modern smart, staying true to its Japanese theme from everything from the wall fixtures to the wooden archway over the bar to the lovely ceramic wares and dishes.\n\nOkay, now onto the food - I had the:\n\n Hitokuchi Oden - delicious fried fish cakes (ling cod & other)  with daikon and egg in dashi broth\n\n Yakitori (skewers) of breast & Ume (plum) jam - served with lemons ~ very plump & juicy meat\n\n Natto donburi - traditional Japanese fermented soybeans (stinky!

Solid izakaya / yakitori joint, but lack of a killer item keeps it from must-go status for now.\n\nOrdered:\n\n4.5 *\n-Iwashi no nanbanzuke - best dish of the night; surprisingly large anchovies, nicely battered and marinated in slightly spicy vinegar marinade.\n-Hirame no kobujime - nice gelatinous texture and mild flavor.\n\n4 *\n-Bincho maguro no tataki - decently fresh with shiso and vinegar. A bit light on the flavor and I couldn't really taste any effect of the searing.\n-King trumpet mushroom skewer - mirin-based sauce, well-grilled\n\n3.5 *\nThigh + sansho skewer - nicely charred, but lacking in charcoal odor relative to other yakitori joints; meat is quite soft, but a little on the bland side, and sansho flavor a bit weak\nNatto don - nice, large beans with a bit more fermented flavor (akin to aka-miso); overall, it tastes like nattou you can get in the store, and not sure if it was mixed well enough.\nKama tama udon - nice to see japanese-style pasta with raw egg, but fails in comparison to Momotaro's chili mentaiko spaghetti\n\n3 *\nHanetsuki gyoza - large, meaty fried dumplings with extra fried batter. Almost Chinese-style with strong ginger flavor. I don't think it's worth the money, though.\n\nMiscellaneous notes:\n-The shichimi that comes with the skewers is pretty nice; sake list is small but I had a good glass.\n-They may have meat that's not on the menu, so if you want a particular cut, you can try asking the server.\n-Pretty new joint, so I think they are working out some kinks with the coursing.\n-Overall nice ambience, somewhat reminiscent of Ippuku (though perhaps not at that level). We sat at the bar, which is nice, but not the most comfortable (weirdly, most seats were wooden, except a couple which have cushioned seats).\n-Easy reservation online a few days in advance (wide open for Thursday night)\n-If you're there early, go around the corner to Rainbow to pick up some tea.", "author": "M N."}

I can get better service at a dive Chinese restaurant in the sunset. Our server Yuko was forgetful, rude, and slow! \n\nFirst Incident: we sat down and order some drinks and potstickers while we waited for our guest to arrive. She wrote down the order, but forgot to put it in. 20 minutes goes by and we asked if our beers were coming and she rudely says \"yea yea yea\"... beers came 5 minutes later.\n\nSecond incident... so our guest arrived few minutes after the beers arrive and we were ready to order. We were ready to order after 10 minutes of going over the menu. Remember this is our first time here. As first time customers at your restaurant, of course we will have questions about your menu and sometimes we will want to change up what we ordered. Yuko was being impatient and gave me this nasty \"uhhhhh\" noise like she was annoyed. Excuse me, you don't ever do that to a customer. \n\nThird incident... Yuko came to give our table a pitcher of water. While she dropped off the pitcher to us, she said... \"it'll be really busy so I won't be able to fill up your pitcher, but there's a sink right behind your table, you can fill it up yourself there.\" Really lady? \n\nFourth incident... so remember those potstickers I ordered as an appetizer before my guest came: yeah you got it... she forgot those too. I asked another server if they were otw, she said we didn't order any. Yuko comes by while I was talking to the other server and I asked if she put the potstickers in. Again she was rude about it and said \"no I forgot\" wtf lady. Get your priorities right.\n\nFifth incident... I asked Yuko for paper napkins, she said rudely \"we don't have paper napkins, we only have Japanese napkin.\" (She points at the moist towel that was given to us while everyone sat down). I point at the paper napkin that was given to me while with my beer... she walks away and grabs a stack of the beverage napkins and just drops it at the table.\n\nSixth incident... we grab the check from another server bc Yuko was not giving us any attention. We got the check about to pay, Yuko comes running tell us she forgot to add gratuity to the bill. In my mind you don't deserve that 18% percent. But I said fuck it... because we will never come back to this establishment ever again. Some of the shittiest service I've ever received. \n\nWait there's more... I ordered a spring mountain egg on my udon... she forgot to put that in my udon too. \n\nOther than Yuko... the food was good, the other servers were great.

But if you want an interesting experience with delicately prepared flavorful Japanese food, this is heaven.\n\nMy favorite is the curry but I might be alone on that because it isn't on the menu all the time.  It's just a really robust flavor and they serve it with a raita. I originally thought, how strange, but now I'm in love.  I order two bowls when I come.  No sharing.  When it's on the menu I'm there.  When it's not on the menu...well, I still am there.\n\nTamago sounds like it's oh just some ho hum egg.  Well sure you can think that because that's what I thought, but no.  It's silky and rich but yet light.  I don't know what they do but it's great.  But honestly, it's the neatest thing watching them cook it.  You should sit at the counter and watch him make it.\n\nOther notables.  Hmmm.\n\nYakitori sticks - okra and duck are my fav. but other ones I think are good: chicken oysters, meatballs, thigh and onion.  They do all sorts of parts of the chicken.   But the duck....they serve it with yuzukosho.  I went out and bought a bottle of that stuff (spicy yuzu paste). So good.\n\nTonkatsu - man they make it good.  They do it layered style.  The tonkatsu sauce is a little dark, but it'll work.\n\nChicken and cheese katsu - not as good for me, but mostly cuz i like my katsu without cheese!\n\nWings - they are enjoyable.  Small portion but it's good. It's not out of the world wings but it's good (and I don't like wings, so that does mean something)\n\nFried shrimp croquette - I don't like shrimp but have been told it's quite good.\n\nFish - I don't like fish but i have gone with many folks who say the fish is out of this world.  it's simple preparation but get the whole fish apparently.  And it looks like they cook it in a little toaster.  But whatever they do, it's supposedly really good.  Even I'm tempted to try it sometimes, but then i remember I don't care for fish.\n\nUdon - they seem to really like making the udon but honestly it's good.  Just good.  Soup is great, flavor is awesome, noodles are nice but for me, Udon is udon is udon.  Their zaru (cold) udon was really good though.  I felt that the freshness of the noodles came out more there than in the hot udon.\n\nMatsutake rice bowl - so simple. Sounds so boring.  But it was delicate and flavorful all at the same time. I could have eaten the whole thing by myself.\n\nMochi dessert - they run out but the one time I caught it in time it was great. It was a mochi ice cream dessert and looked nothing like I thought - it was a flat layer of mochi and a cube sized ice cream.  Really good.\n\nOr you could head a few doors down to Nihon Whiskey lounge for liquid dessert.\n\nReservations online - they added a credit card for reservations now. I think the counter is first come first served.  Best spots in the house because you get to see how things are made!\n\nAll major credit cards are cool. Bathroom in the back.  Parking blows. Uber.

We had 3 types (rintaro tsukune, thigh and onion, and chicken oyster). I think the rintaro tsukune and chicken oyster were the most delicious. The thigh was good. I'd suggest getting a few of these to share. We got udon to share - we wanted the special one, but they didn't have anymore. This one had an egg that came with it. It was cooked in the sauce all together. Definitely different and pretty good to share together. \n\nOverall, the food was good, but honestly, with that kind of service, I'd rather not come back. I can find good yakitori elsewhere with much better service. \n\nProtip: just go yourself. I don't think I'll be going back.", "author": "Nina Y."}

We had a beer, chicken meat balls, and salmon wrapped in a Persimmon (?) leaf.  All that was great - and a good start to our meal.  The courtyard was small and cute, and suitable for this type of event and good for those waiting for a table inside.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is beautiful - simple in some ways, but lots of details in others.  My friend and I sat at the bar, and we had fun eating and watching everyone in the kitchen cooking.\n\nHere's what we had:\n- Kumkuat Champagne cocktail\n- Sake flight\n- Maguro\n- Small Dashi Maki Tamago (exceptionally good - one of my favorites. Somehow they made a normal almost-always overlooked item into a hit)\n- Yakitori items: Chicken gizzard, liver, kneecap, thigh meat\n- Teuchi Udon (another favorite - the udon must be house-made.  I definitely will come back to order this)\n- Hojicha Panna Cotta (again, I loved this dish. It has such a nice green tea flavor in both the panna cotta and the syrup that you pour over it. The panna cotta also had a great texture, and this dish is not overly sweet)\n\nOverall this meal for the two of us set us back $120 before tip AND excluding what we ate in the courtyard.  The bill would have been much higher if I brought my husband.  It's not a big meal, but if you want some good izakaya food that is good across the board, make this a special treat.  OR you can grab and drink and snack here, rather than a meal, to bring down the cost - but it's definitely worth a stop.", "author": "Tracy L."}

We were offered a table that was available until a reservation 1.5 hours later, which was completely fine.\n\nOur party of four ordered a significant fraction of the menu (I estimate 50-60% of the menu), and we were not disappointed. The yakitori was well done and while I never quite imagined myself being in Japan, despite the excellent ambience, I was more than satisfied with the izakaya vibe. I would really like to come back here and have a rerun in one of the booths with some more time on my hands.\n\nThe sake offerings were excellent. Their home-made plum wine also hit the spot. It is served with sparkling wine or by itself on the rocks; we ordered both and preferred the undiluted version.\n\nOne of our favourite dishes, despite our intended homage to carnivorism, was actually the salad with apples. The natural flavours and seasonings really worked fantastically well together, and it was an unexpected and truly refreshing counterpoint to the skewers.\n\nThe service was excellent throughout, with just the right proportions of attention and lack of interruption.\n\nEven though we (shamefully) overshot our 1.5-hour allowance, by ~15 minutes, we did not feel rushed to leave.

Can't wait to come back and hope you get to try this exquisite place.\n\nAs a note, we ordered a lot of food for two people and easily got to $150-$200 dinner ticket.

But if not on a budget, I would go to town and order everything that sounds delicious to you because it most likely will be one of your favorite meals in SF. \n\nThis is a sampling of what we ordered and would highly recommend coming here:\n\n- Yosedofu - mmmm delicious. Homemade silky tofu with delicate toppings\n\n- half quail yakitori - I could have ate more than just one - perfectly grilled and seasoned that will make your mouth and stomach yearn for more\n\n- trumpet mushroom yakitori - yummy mushrooms!\n\n- some sort of vegetable salad with duck and pluqot - very good and you'll just have to see my photo of this because I'm forgetting the name of this dish\n\n- fried chicken (kaarage) - this was Soo good my friend and I could have easily gone through two orders of this\n \n- carbonara udon - the noodles were great and we should have probably slurped up the egg afterwards but forgot to (or wasn't sure if we should have) ... Flavor may have been a bit lacking here or needed a little bit of salt\n\n- kake udon with tempura fried onions in fish broth soup - good  balance between crunch and slurp... Delicious and may have preferred this over the carbonara \n\nSKIP The red eye tuna sashimi - was ok, but probably would not order this again only because the other food is more fun and fantastic to eat ... And why spend $17 on this when you can get it at another restaurant...\n\nLastly, you really should have beers with your food.

My friend and I ordered several dishes and we ended up spending around $45 each after tax and tip.\n\nWe began with Yosedofu, which we split into separate bowls. The Yosedofu was very well made, and had the consistency of what I imagine to be one of the sweet tofu dishes I had back when I loved street food in China.\n\nIn addition, we had Tamago. It was a good dish, although I kind of thought we would've gotten the tamago as a sashimi (so the egg would be over some rice). Delicious anyway.\n\nWe also ordered Chizu Katsu, which translated to fried chicken and cheese. Don't be fooled by this seemingly American-style dish! It was very delicious and completely worth it.\n\nWe couldn't leave here without trying the Yakitori. Rintaro makes amazing Yakitori- we ordered Liver, Skin, and Thigh + Onion. My favorite, by far, was the skin. It was decadent, delicious, and amazing. You get two skewers per order to split between you and a friend.\n\nFinally, we left after a bowl of udon in a delicious soup.

The service was better and food came out at a good pace (unlike last time). I think that's why our experience is much better this time. Arrived ten min early for our dinner reservation. There were 5-6 people standing by the hostess when we arrived. I guess they didn't have reservations bc we were seated immediately after checking in with the hostess. \n\nWhat we had:\nHaru no NUTA- refreshing salad of turnips, asparagus, turnip greens, and spring onions with the perfect balance of mustard and wasabi flavors; reminds me of the wasabi potato salad at Delica (which is one of my favorite salads)\nMegami MAGURO- good texture sashimi, served with cilantro flowers\nHanatsuki GYOZA- Berkshire pork with chicken foot jelly and 'wings', wow I loved this and could eat so many!! You could taste the freshness of the ingredients and the outside is a little crispy but they were super juicy inside... Almost like xlb soup dumplings. Who would've thought gyoza could be this good?!\nKabocha KAROKKE- curry, kabocha and potato croquettes. Fried perfectly with Acme bread crumbs and not greasy at all. Just the right about of curry flavor in the croquette. It's like eating tonkatsu curry without having to have saucy curry and meat. \nODEN- we chose simmered daikon, grilled/fried meiji tofu, fish cake with tuna; tasty, cooked in flavorful broth\nNATTO DON- natto over rice served with umeboshi and toasted nori; I normally do not like natto, but this one wasn't bad. I even ate a few bites. The natto was less strongly/slimey than others and the toasted nori made it taste even better. The rice I thought could be better tho\nTeuchi UDON with spring egg- handpulled udon cooked in two fish broth, green onion and nori; ordered this after seeing chef Sylvan make the udon while we were eating. So glad we tried it. Texture was harder/chewy, similar to tsukemen noodles and the broth is very flavorful, also very good with the remnants of the spring egg\nSuiyoubi no neko BEER- light beer in a cute can\n\nEvery item we had was delicious. The only thing I'd point out is the 5 piece maguro sashimi was $18 which I would not get again. But I'm not a fan of tuna either sooo.... \n\nOverall, this is easily my go-to izakaya if I lived closer and I would take out-of-town friends and family to for reliable good food and experience. I recommend anyone to get their CROQUETTES, GYOZAS, and reservations when they dine here. I've had their trout and potato croquettes and they were also amazzzing. Their menu changes so you could come back for different croquettes and maybe even gyozas. I'd just stay away from yakitori and sashimi (over-priced and not their best items IMO).\n\nI saw chef Sylvan work with mochi last time and saw him hand-roll udon this time. Lucky me! He even came by to give us fresh kumquats after and I LOVE kumquats. We had no room for dessert, but the kumquats were perfect, something small, sweet and tart to end our meal.", "author": "Iris H."}

We ordered the gizzard, the thigh with scallion, the oysters and meatballs. The skewers were anywhere from $6 to $8 per pair. The gizzards were my favorite and the hubby loved the oysters. Overall, the meat is tender and flavorful.\n\nWe also got the fried chicken stuffed with cheese, the pork shumai, and the egg omelette. The chicken katsu was crispy and not greasy tasting. I felt like the cheese was unnecessary because it's a very mild cheese so I couldn't really taste it that much. The egg was great, simple and full of umami. The standout was the shumai -- I love the young ginger and the pork was so tender and studded with just the right amount of fat. I think that's a must order.\n\nThe place is pretty pricey and they don't offer any option for \"fillers\" such as any starch  aside from porridge.

I was most impressed by the kake udon since finding good udon in San Francisco is like looking for a unicorn.  The best tasting dish we had was the kamo no menchi katsu.  The breaded and fried duck was delicious and almost decadent in taste.  The only drawback to our experience was that service was mediocre.  We were stuffed into the back room corner that was dimly lit and infrequently visited by servers.  The order of our food was also strange and a little disorganized, but also very slow.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-12-23", "description": "I feel like I've been starting every review lately with \"FINALLY got to try...\" but my recent visit to Rintaro was one of my most anticipated meals of the year. If you haven't heard of it or paid a visit, you must, especially if you love Japanese food as much as I do. Rintaro now takes the crown for me for best Japanese restaurant in the city. \n\nFirstly, I highly recommend making a reservation through Resy (go to their site and you'll see how). They do require a card, and a hefty $25 if you cancel after a certain time before your reservation, but hey - I can appreciate - if you're not committed and considerate, they probably don't want your business :P. In terms of seating options, I also recommend the Chef's counter so that you can watch the cooking and prep. This is always my favorite seat in any restaurant, although, if you're coming with more than 2 people, the tables are a better (and still great) option. \n\nThe food is high quality and delicious. We ordered a bit from every part of the menu - some chicken meatball yakitori, the large cod (not as large as you'd think, it was easily demolished between two people), halibut sashimi, steelhead roe don buri, and the fried chicken wings. What I loved about the food was that as soon as I would claim \"THIS\" was my favorite dish, the next would come and I would be equally (and happily) torn about it being my new favorite. A tip - if you're sharing any of the don buri's, ask for another small bowl. One of my pet peeves is eating rice from a plate. Our server made great recommendations, and I am already excited about my next visit so I can try more (silken tofu!). \n\nAnd the ambiance.... perfection. If you've been to Japan, you'll know and can related to what I'm talking about. It's the kind of place you'll probably pass 10 times and not know it exists but serendipitous-ly, I passed by it on my way home from Rainbow one day and decided to explore. \n\nOh, try the fermented plum sparkling wine drink - it's super sweet (get as dessert), but they age those suckers for 8 months!!

Muahaaahaaa.\n\nSoftly opening on Monday, November 10th, Rintaro took over the Chez Spencer location. Currently, there's no reservations. It's first come, first serve. Even before they opened at 5:30 pm, there was a line so come early. \n\nRintaro serves izakaya, Japanese tapas. Compared to other izakaya restaurants I've been to, Rintaro's menu is smaller and more focused: http://bit.ly/1sIfHaQ. Usually, the rule of thumb is to order about 3-4 dishes per a person and then a finisher like a bowl of ramen or don (they only have don, rice bowls on the menu). The alkie menu is pretty limited with just two beers and three sake/shochu options (my beer was $10.50 a bottle!). It's not cheap here; our bill for two including tip was $176. =X\n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\n*Complimentary Boiled Peanuts: http://bit.ly/1BgJfFN\n*Hanetsuki Gyoza: Berkshire Pork Gyoza (6 for $12): http://bit.ly/1u5Oa63\n*Yakitori Chef's Choice: Tsukune, Thigh, Thigh w/ onion, Gizzard, Wing & Mushroom ($15.50): http://bit.ly/1sIgtUj\n*Yakitori: Skin & Gizzard ($6, $5.50): http://bit.ly/1xBnbSn\n*Yakitori: Liberty Duck ($6): http://bit.ly/1xBnooE\n*Kare No Karaage: Crispy Fried Sole ($22): http://bit.ly/1EGfkp1\n*Keihan: Rice w/ chicken broth, chicken breast, shiso & egg ($6.50): http://bit.ly/1v8cDe4 \n*Santa Barbara Uni Donburi (off the menu - $8): http://bit.ly/1yCrWJQ\n*Kaki Yonashi Kanten: Persimmon & Wine-Poached Pear Jelly w/ vanilla ice cream & brown sugar reduction ($8.75): http://bit.ly/1sIhA6u\n\nAs with any newly opened restaurant, there are bound to be kinks so it was nice that they provided complimentary boiled peanuts (sweet and savory) for us to nosh on while we waited for our order. \n\nIt's rare to find housemade gyoza on the menu, and Rintaro's rendition didn't disappoint. The thick skin had a toothsome chew with a nice, crispy browned bottom, and the pork filling was juicy and flavorful. However, the wrapper broke apart when picking up with chopsticks and the filling fell out of the gyoza.\n\nThe highlight of their izakaya menu are their yakitori skewers. Every yakitori we had was uber tender, subtly smoky, and lightly seasoned with tare (soy basting sauce) or shio (salt). Mr. NSS' loved the gizzards so much that we ordered two additional orders. \n\nThe best bang for your buck is the kare no karaage: crispy fried sole which is served whole and you can eat everything including the bones. Forget your chopsticks and use your hands to break apart the crunchy fish with tender flesh. We really enjoyed this dish as it was satisfying and not greasy at all. Great frying technique. \n\nThe dishes we were most excited about were the most disappointing dishes of the night. The uni don (off the menu because it's limited) was basically one slab of uni over a bowl of rice served alongside strips of nori and soy. While the uni was deliciously sweet and briny, the rice was dry and hard, and not palatable. For $8, it would have been nice to elevate the don like with an onsen tamago (Japanese hot spring egg). The keihan didn't fare any better. It was like a bland chicken porridge. \n\nDessert did redeem the disappointing finishers. The persimmon and pear jelly were refreshing with concentrated flavors that was prominent yet subtle. Loved the vanilla ice cream which I showered with the brown sugar reduction. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nThe staff was nice and polite but it was confusing because it didn't seem like they had assigned tables. One staff took our order but then others took our additional orders. If you're in a time crunch, I suggest that you tell them to bring everything as they're ready. Otherwise, they will stagger your order and won't fire up something unless you're done with a particular course.\n\nOne thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was as we were leaving, we passed by several of the staff including the hostess and no one bothered to say, \"bye\" or thank us for coming. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nMy gf and I celebrated our birthdays at Chez Spencer and the new space was unrecognizable; clean, zen, and with lots of light natural woods. There's 3 two-tops, five booths, and 12-13 seats at the counter with a front view to the open kitchen. There's also one lonely table in the front courtyard.\n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nSemi-difficult street parking.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-10-20", "description": "Foodwise, this is a solid 4 star restaurant. Standouts are their homemade tofu, undon and the chicken skewers. Most other menu items are pretty good. Exceptions are the whole fried fish and donburi. Donburi is just so so and bland. Fish was awful. It was the most expensive item on the menu and when it came out it was fried so crisp, the meat had shriveled away to nothing and you were left with bone and super oily crust. \n\nService-wise, this place is neutral to sucky on most nights. Thus the three-star rating. I've been here at least 4-5 times and each time (last 3 times within the last 6 months), the service leaves a little more to be desired. Once we left without sitting because after making a reservation, showing up on time, waiting for 20 more minutes, they offered us a table right by the door where other people waiting were congregated. We would have had people's butts in our face the entire time we're dining. When we pointed to a quieter table in the corner that was also available, they said they were going to squeeze three people into that so, no, not for us (party of 2). During our most recent visit, we showed up on time, hostess tells me it will be a few minutes. I see couple of booths ready and set up. I ask if we can get one of those (as we've always been taken to the back room where it's less pleasant in our prior visits). She looks at me and says it will be 5 minutes (for no good apparent reason). I say ok. We stand around the hostess station and awkwardly avoid eye contact with the hostess until 5 minutes is over and she sits us down. WTF... \n\nSo in conclusion, this is a good enough place to go with good friends. I would never take anyone I need to impress as the service level is not there. I like the food and the ambiance enough that I've gone back multiple times, but with each episode, I question whether it's worth going back. I really hope they improve service. Then I'll be there every week!", "author": "Liz K."}

I was ten minutes early on a Saturday. In my experience this usually implies I will wait until at least 7:15 to be seated. But the hostess kept me posted on the status of the existing diners and we were seated before five past. The servers were attentive and helpful without being intrusive throughout the evening. Even the chefs we were lucky enough to have a front and center view of from the counter were happy to answer our many questions and offer advice on how to choose from the many great menu options. \n\nThe food is available izakaya style and intended for sharing so you are able to enjoy a variety even if there are just two of you. Every dish we had was great. Definitely try at least a couple of skewers. I wish we could have had more but will just have to be back. The shoulder was really outstanding. \n\nDo be aware it's helpful to have a sense of how to use chopsticks. I assume they will provide a fork if you need to ask, but this type of food is worth learning to use chopsticks for if you don't already know. \n\nI had the sake flight and highly recommend that as well. Each was delicious but very different. It was a nice way to experience the breadth of the beverage without having to think very hard about my choice. I just wish they had an Omakase menu option so I could have done the same with the food!\n\nFinally, the space is incredible. The architecture is worth taking in and appreciating before you get too absorbed in the food. I also appreciated how lively but casual it was. \n\nMy kind of place.

Tasted average, but I liked how the outer shell was made of rice as opposed to a traditional dumpling-like wanton. Unfortunately, this item was one of the more overpriced on the menu ($15 for 3 teeny tiny dumplings!)\n- Silken tofu (one of the house dishes): the tofu was impossibly soft, so much so that the consistency was reminiscent of a soft creamy cheese (like the inside of burrata). I couldn't take more than a few bites but appreciated the dish for its uniqueness\n- Green tea: refilled for free without my having to ask, wahoo!\n\nHighly recommend trying this place out with a few friends so you can order family style and try as many unique dishes as possible!

It was secluded, had a side decorative kitchen area, but I probably would have preferred to be in the main dining area because the ambience of an izakaya felt so authentic there. \nFive stars for ambience and decor. \nNow on to the food, the menu offers a good variety of items. My bf and I were on somewhat of a paleo diet, so this review on food will be very protein focused. \nWe ordered the albacore tuna sashimi. One of my favorites - it was so smooth and delicious. Our second order was Yakitori - chicken thigh and onion. This was also very good. I am one to enjoy a bit of crisp on the edges and this dish hit the spot. Then we had the Teba No Karaage - Japanese Fried Chicken with a smoky Tare. The chicken was prepped and fried very well! \nFinally, we shared the Rainbow Trout Lrg. If you're looking for a no frills, clean dish, this is the one to get. \nWe were still a bit hungry, so we ordered more Yakitori - another order of the chicken thigh and onion, and this time also the chicken oyster.

The meal went downhill from there. The natto gohan was extremely bland and unappetizing. The chicken katsu with wagon wheel cheese was nothing special. The cucumbers in the sunomono were under-marinated and the black cod was fishy. The agedashi tofu was average at best.\n\nDon't get me wrong - I can appreciate subtle and delicate flavors. But what Rintaro delivers is a real lack of flavor.", "author": "Yi Z."}

The restaurant had a really nice atmosphere inside, and the service was great.\n\nBetween the two of us, we had:\n- Chicken heart skewers (5/5) - as good as it sounds\n- Chicken thigh and scallion skewers (4/5) - the scallions are especially good\n- Chicken oyster skewers (4/5) - flavorful dark meat\n- Duck skewers (3/5) - really spicy, but not as good as the chicken skewers\n- Shrimp and cucumber appetizer (3/5) - not too exciting\n- Kurobuta shumai (4/5) - this really isn't a shumai.  Instead, it's a Chinese \"lion's head\" pork meatball covered with a layer of rice.  Still really tasty.\n- Fried oysters (4/5) - big oysters fried with perfectly crispy breading\n- Keihan (5/5) - a deep, intense chicken broth with rice.

It's set back from the sidewalk in a part of town that's less than glamorous, but don't let that throw you: it'll be one of the best Japanese dining experiences you'll ever have.  No wonder this place (and its chef) has received \"best\" awards by numerous critics, media, and average folks like me.  Everything is cooked to perfection, and the sashimi is the freshest and most flavorful around.  The vibe is low-key and cozy, and the service is friendly and fantastic.  We sat at the counter and enjoyed watching the different people do their assigned tasks of grilling, frying, slicing, skewering, and plating so gracefully -- all the while smiling and making conversation and ensuring that we were being attended to.  \nThings to try: the skewers (we had meatballs, gizzards, and livers -- amazing), whole fried sole, yellowtail and tuna sashimi, housemade tofu, and housemade udon.  The sake flight was also delicious, thanks to our server's recommendation, as was the green tea panna cotta.  \nThere are a still a ton of dinner options that we wanted to try but are saving for next time; until then, we can't wait to come back and see what lunch is like.

It's like night and day.  The service seemed slower too, and we were forgotten several times.

Excellent!\"\n\nEvery place I called either didn't have space or didn't take reservations, but Rintaro said they always reserve some space at the bar for walk ins. Since we were eating dinner on the early side (6:30pm) on a weeknight, I figured this was fine. \n\nOn the night of, my friend arrived early, seated himself at the bar, and ordered a cocktail while he waited for me. Apparently, the hostess made it a point to come over several times to let him know that he wouldn't get a table since he didn't make a reservation. That, understandably, made him a little uncomfortable. \n\nWhen I arrived, the space next to him opened up at the bar, so I sat down and voila - we were seated. No drama at all!  I immediately noticed that the decor was very cute and well done, as others have mentioned. Other than the hostess shaming us for not having a reservation, the rest of the service was actually excellent. We asked our server for recommendations and generally went with them. Dishes were:\n\nDuck Yakitori - The two pieces were on the smaller side, but they were tender and tasty. \nWhole trout - Good sized portion of fish. Fresh and tasty, but we both wished the skin had been cooked a little longer.\nChicken Karaage - Very crispy as karaage should be. Lots of flavor, but I actually found it to be oversalted. The lime slices were cut too thin that we couldn't actually squeeze them without getting juice everywhere. \nRoe over rice with shiso - This dish was like making your own roe handroll. Very tasty if you like roe and handrolls. \n\nOverall we enjoyed the meal (the bottle of sake might've helped). The reasons for not receiving a higher rating are:\n1) There were ants coming from the flowers on the table. The ants were crawling onto the plates with our dishes! I had to watch the plates like a hawk and flick the ants off. This made the whole situation less appetizing. I'm pretty sure this is a health code violation. \n2) The price was a bit on the expensive side for the experience that we got.", "author": "Janet Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-16", "description": "Overall a disappointing experience. Rintaro has potential, but has a ways to go. \n\nI must preface by saying this review is strictly based off my experience on Valentine's Day's prix fixe menu. I included each course in my review, but skip to the bottom for the gist. \n\nI was excited when Mr. Rintaro posted a special V-Day menu on Instagram just a few days before. 8 courses for $75/person, not bad. \n\nUpon arrival, the place looks great. From the wooden gateway with their Rintaro stamp logo signage, to the dim lit outdoor rock garden seating area, into the open and bustling kitchen space with bar seating, high ceilings, and traditional style booths in the main room. Of course, my 7:15 reservation landed me in the back room, what looks like a converted storage space that they've decorated with some flower branches, so we didn't get to enjoy the beautiful space and its ambiance, but that's fine, I'm looking forward to the food.\n\n:: The Menu :: \n\nDrinks: Sake flight ($26): 3 beautiful glass cups: 1) Hakkaisan (junmai). 2) Izumo Fuji (junmai). 3) Kinka (daiginjo). The Kinka was my favorite. Also got a cup of hot tea, served in a small tea cup, no teapot included. (Note: not one time did any server come by to refill my tea). \n\n1st course: Radishes with miso & nut paste. The 2 pieces of sliced radish (long leafy stems in tact) was served with 3 sliced carrots (one slice w/ its carrot top in tact) and 2 pieces of endive. The carrots were roughly chopped, and with the stems and carrot tops in tact, it looked sloppy together on the long rectangular plate. Didn't eat the long radish stems or carrot tops. \n\n2nd: Dashimaki tamago. 1 piece per person. Decent job with the rolled egg, a fluffy bite and a classic Japanese menu item. \n\n3rd: Night smelt and nori tempura w/ matcha salt. 3 pieces of smelt tempura each, and 1 nori piece of tempura each. Fried decently, with a dab of matcha salt on the side. (Note: the tempura came out of order on the menu, and when we said to the server we haven't had our sashimi yet, the server seemed a little annoyed, took it back, only to have another lady bring the tempura back to us saying, \"the sashimi takes a little bit longer\". Ok? And we didn't ask to send it back, just an observation that it came out of order. Next.)\n\n4th: California bluefin tuna w/ Half Moon Bay Wasabi & Kushi oysters w/ dashi gelee. 2 pieces of tuna sashimi each, 1 oyster each. The quality of the tuna was there, but it doesn't come with enough wasabi, definitely not enough to taste on all 4 slices of tuna. The oyster with dashi gelee were just ok, it tasted like they could have been sitting out for a while. Kushis are small and we only got 1 each. \n\n5th: BN Ranch New York steak, Liberty duck breast and king trumpets. This dish wasn't what they originally posted on the menu. The duck breast was supposed to be served with hand-rolled udon. I guess the udon wasn't ready, and so they combined the duck with the steak and served it side by side dressed with some baby greens in between. The best part of the dish were the seasoned king trumpet mushrooms sitting under the duck breasts. The steak was medium-to-well, on the chewy side, and pretty hacked up slices. 3 small slices of steak each with some minced daikon to go with it. Duck was also a bit chewy, 1 slice each. Probably the most underwhelming dish of the night since it was the main course, wasn't what they advertised, and it didn't really make sense put together. \n\n6th: Quinalt Nation Steelhead roe over rice w/ shiso. So this was the last course before dessert and it's a lot of white rice and a lot of roe, and a shiso leaf.  The roe was good, and the white rice did fill me up for the time being. Still couldn't help but feel underwhelmed again at this point. \n\n7th: Chocolate almond cake w/ candied rose petals. Baked in the shape of a madeline, 2 pieces each, and 1 rose petal each, served with powdered sugar. Technically a cake, but not the kind you eat with a fork. 2 chocolate madelines for dessert. A disappointing finale. \n\nWrap up:\n\nI came in a follower of Rintaro and Peko Peko. Their presentation & aesthetics are so well done and it gives you the impression that they've got it down. Leaving the dinner, I gotta say I was really disappointed and unimpressed. A lot of the food was just ok, and not one course stood out. The menu was a mish-mash of uninspired dishes. Definitely not the caliber of food to justify the price. The service was friendly, although a bit slow and still learning as they go. \n\nTo be fair, Rintaro is still new to the game, and this was a one-off menu. On the flipside, this was supposed to be a special prix fixe menu for an eventful evening. Don't advertise a special menu if you're going to serve us mediocre, uninspired food, for a higher price no less (w/tip around $250). It only raises more questions about the caliber of Rintaro's food in general. If only they'd shine with their cooking, as they do with their appearance. Step it up, Rintaro!", "author": "Dave H."}

There were a good amount of people there and were able to sit at the bar. I ordered some sake and we ordered a bunch of items:\n\nYosedofu (freshly made silken tofu) - Good, but I'm not use to this type of tofu and thought it was a bit much.\nHanetsuki Gyoza - Pretty good and made fresh.\nTenders with Wasabi and Chicken Skin (on the house) Skewers - I really liked the tenders. The chicken skin was surprisingly good and I can't say no to free. Some other customers ordered this and for whatever reason, didn't want it so the chef asked us if we wanted it.\nHalibut Shashimi - This was probably my favorite. \n\nI really enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching everyone in the kitchen making food.

So hint of the day is: if you're ordering, say one tonkatsu and one noodle, for a party of two who want to eat the \"main course\" (i.e. tonkatsu/noodles) at the same time, you need to tell the wait staff, otherwise, they'll come out one after the other.\n\nWe really liked the chicken yakitori -- cooked just right, not too salty, like many places, and good flavor, and the gyoza are a must-have; really delicious.

The lunch menu is very small but the dish descriptions made it sound varied and delicious. I don't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was basically a sashimi bowl over rice for $25 and a $4 glass of ice tea. What arrived was about a buck and a half worth of sashimi that was impossibly flavorless with the fish cut so tiny it should have been called tartar, not sashimi. Even the cucumber and crab salad lacked seasoning and tasted as watered down as... water. There were these little dishes with a few slices of radish and scallions, presumably to season the bowl with but after adding them all to my bowl, while improved, the tiny pieces of fish still lacked texture or anything memorable or even flavorful.\n\nMy colleague is vegetarian and came to try one of the two vegetarian options on the day's lunch menu. The problem was option 1 had chicken (which they would hold), crab (also hold) and fish sauce. Had she ordered it with no actual animals in it, the waitress said she'd end up with a small bit of rice and a few veggies. She opted for option 2, which had less meat for the restaurant to hold. (In reality, there really wasn't any vegetarian options despite the day's menu using the V word to describe two menu choices) Anyway, what she got looked like one of those fried onion blossoms found at cheap quasi-Mexican restaurant chains only this one looked like it was squished and oozing more grease than a veg head or meat head could or should enjoy. And that only set her back $18. Yes, for lunch! I didn't taste it (nor did I want to) so I can't comment on its quality but we both agreed neither of us would be back. Maybe dinner is much better here but I doubt I'll be trying it based on how poorly, and expensively, they do lunch.\n\nUPDATE:\nShortly after my initial review above, management at Rintaro messaged me with a sincere apology for our lunch experience and explained that as a result of the problems I described, their chef/owner has been addressing the issues and evaluating the lunch menu for improvements. They added that he is providing additional training to their kitchen staff and is revising some of the items. And lastly, they offered and provided a full refund for our lunch.\n\nThis effort by the restaurant and the courtesy and professionalism they showed in trying to make things right makes me feel like they deserve another chance. I have added a star to this review and in light of their unsolicited yet welcome response, I believe I will try another lunch at Rintaro sometime in the coming weeks. They recently began their lunch offerings and maybe just need a little time to become a great lunch choice in San Francisco's Mission district.", "author": "Peter S."}

Neither of us really got the hype.\n\nThe service here was prompt and courteous, but the food wasn't mindblowing. We were dissapointed by the limited choices to order from, but still got a good deal of things to try. We really wanted agedashi tofu and chicken karaage, BUT THEY WEREN'T ON TONIGHT'S MENU! Some things are just staples of an izakya--those are not meant to be revolving items.\n\nThe came out in a timely fashion--we started with the silken tofu and were a little confused by the arrangement of accompaniments. The soy sauce was separated in a tiny bowl, rather than with it, and fish flakes and other things were separate. I guess this is great if you are really picky about how much soy sauce you want? This was just okay. That was followed by very salty tamago that should have been sliced thinner. The fried smelt that came next was delicious and had a great sauce. We also ordered thigh and onion, potato, asparagus, and softbone skewers. Soft bone was not soft enough and could have been prepared better as it was on the tough side, and the rest were what'd you expect normally.\n\nThe place is close to home so that's nice, but I'm not walking back through tent city for a just okay izakaya.

We ordered most of the Yelp-famous and staff-famous dishes, of which the simple yet flavorful Dashimaki Tamago was the most successful.  The also-famous Yosedofu (silken tofu) was so mild that we desperately tried to scrape up all of the minced ginger and sauce they provided with it in the hope of adding some flavor.  (It didn't help that they served this dish first; when you're hungry this isn't the best way to start.)  The chicken skewers were reasonably tasty.  We had the Tsukune which is meatball, and wings; these were made better by squeezing 100% of the provided lemon on them.    They also cut us a free taste of the chicken thighs which were probably the best of the bunch.  We finished the mild-taste-parade with their (again famous) Sobacha Panna Cotta Naru.  The sugar sauce was delightful, but something about the panna cotta tasted artificial to me - kind of like how soy milk doesn't taste quite like milk.\n\nWe also took down a KSA kolsch style ale, which was very good, and an excellent cup of traditional Japanese houjicha.\n\nNext time, we will order whatever the F we please - and skip the famous things!", "author": "Aaron M."}

The service was professional that time with a really thoughtful and helpful waitress. That first time would have been a 4 stars.  However, our second experience was subpar.  We were seated at our 8:45pm reservation and majority of the yakitori items on the menu were already sold out.  The only thing left was chicken meatball.  It is called izakaya for a reason and that was our purpose dining there.  Our waitress, Jennifer,  was unapologetic and indifferent.  Basically we asked for one thing and her response was sold out and that continued down the list.  It would have been helpful if she offered to tell us what was left being available.  And to top this off, she spilled soup and soy sauce on us because she said \"I didn't know there was soup.\"  We ordered udon, of course, there was soup.

There are inevitably too many kinks, in both the front and back of the house, to work out. I'd rather try a new place after they have figured everything out. However, when we received an invitation to join friends at Rintaro the week the restaurant opened, I accepted the invitation. We dined on night five of Rintaro being open. \n\nThe wait and kitchen staff are clearly seasoned professionals. I guess I should have expected that from former Chez Panisse folks. The owner also operated a bento catering business and pop up restaurant in the East Bay, and clearly his experience has transferred well to the restaurant.\n\nBetween our party of four, we ordered almost the entire menu. This was by design, and because we love to eat. The dishes are meant for sharing, which worked for our \"eat the entire menu\" plan. \n\nWe started our meal with the Peko Peko Ume-Shu drink. It's a plum (ume) liquor that's great for sipping and tastes just like a Japanese plum. An unusual treat, and the perfect way to start our meal. \n\nWe ate everything from house made soft tofu, yakitori skewers and tamago to pork katsu and kombu-cured halibut. \n\nEverything we tried was beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked. \n\nWe ended our meal with both of the dessert options: persimmon and wine-poached pear jelly with vanilla ice cream and a ginger chiffon cake. Both were a beautiful ending to a fantastic meal. \n\nI'm not ready to give up my waiting period to try new restaurants rule, but I will say that my experience at Rintaro far exceeded any past dining at a newly opened restaurant. If they were that good on night five, I can't wait to see what they're going to be like in a month or two.", "author": "Lee H."}

Even though Japanese fare is not my go-to, I loved this place. Here's why:\n\n+It's a bit off the beaten path. When our uber driver dropped us off, I was totally confused because it looked like we were in a residential neighborhood. Izakaya Rintaro is beautifully nestled on a quiet street, and the exterior is warm and cozy with lights strung above the simple patio. \n\n+They take reservations! (Okay, it's going to be about a 2-hour wait, but still... they take reservations!) They were also incredibly gracious to accommodate an additional 5 people that added to our party at the last minute. \n\n+The service is stellar. Every single person was kind and helpful, and our lovely server was pure perfection. I have this wheat thing, and she helped me navigate the menu without hesitation. So if you need to eat gluten-free for whatever reason, Izakaya Rintaro knows what's up. \n\n+The food is creative, yet comfortable at the same time. Although the dishes had several ingredients I wasn't familiar with, nothing seemed out of reach or too fussy to eat. I decided on a couple different types of chicken skewers (with gf soy sauce, of course), and they were simple and delicious. I also split the dessert -- a green tea panna cotta -- with a friend, and it was weird and wonderful. And from the looks of it, everyone loved their meals. One thing to note: the food here really is tapas style, so be prepared to order several plates and share them.\n\n+The interior is minimalistic and beautiful.

Rintaro certainly doesn't need my help, but rather has just consistently surpassed our expectations every visit, enough so that this is the least I could do.\n \nI truly believe Rintaro is one of the most special, unique places in San Francisco. While Al's Place, Lazy Bear, etc. pop up in the news regularly, somehow Rintaro remains a relatively under-the-radar gem. Having eaten at many of the top spots in the city, I believe they care as much or more about their food than any other top restaurant in SF. Whether it's painstakingly made Udon, the greatest Tamago I've had always (at least every time I've been) prepared by Chef Brackett himself (and not frequently enough on the menu), some of the most consistently fantastic Yakitori I've seen including my time in Japan (and maybe the best variety of chicken bits in SF, make sure you ask if anything isn't on the menu), even to the home made tofu and plum wine in their cocktails, there is a level of detail and love not always shared by Rintaro's peers.\n \nBut even beyond the food, the experience is unparalleled. Where you may wait in the crowded front room at Al's, at Rintaro you are welcomed by a beautiful garden scene somehow hidden from the unsightly streets just outside. As you arrive and leave, you will often be thanked by both the wait staff and the cooks behind the counter for your patronage. And if you go for a special occasion (we just did our anniversary), you may be able to slip a special request (ours was having Tamago on the menu - and it wasn't, but rather a special order was prepared and served to us as a first course), you may even luck out with a complimentary drink or two before your meal, and if you're fortunate enough, maybe even a quick hello from Chef Brackett. And it is this, the complete experience, that sets Rintaro apart.\n \nWhen you go, in case it wasn't obvious, order at least one piece of chicken you wouldn't normally (kanzuri or hearts perhaps?). If you can, ask for a seat at the counter where you can see the chefs' attention to detail in action. Don't just get a beer (although I usually do), inquire about which cocktail is your host's favorite or would pair best with your meal. And again, get the Tamago.\n \nAnd thank you Chef Brackett and all of Rintaro for another special night (the best one yet).

They should've told us of the 2hr limit when we made the reservation, but informing us during our meal is just rude and unprofessional.", "author": "Pegs C."}

The restaurant itself is super interesting, with a long bar as you enter with booths on the other side, exposed beams overhead, and traditional Japanese curtain partitions placed here and there. Feels a little close quartered, intimate and rustic.  Especially with all the smoke from the open grill swirling around.  When you step in from the street, through the courtyard and into the restaurant you feel like you've stepped into an old timey Japanese izakaya joint. From the street, you would never guess that behind the wooden gate was this sweet little Japanese eatery. The service was very attentive, our waiter helped us pick out the initial cocktail, and then parse through the sake list to chose a very yummy bottle. As an izakaya place it was many many small plates of food. We have been to many and this one definitely stacks up with the best. Menu was varied, veggis and proteins fresh, and preparation spot on.  There were four of us and one was a vegetarian, so we tried the sashimi, the housemade tofu (YUM!), various yakitory skewers, the croquettes, dumplings, chicken karaage and finished things off with beef curry (SO good!). I will say it was a pricey meal, but very memorable and special. Definitely one to add to this list of places to go for a unique, delicious and enjoyable meal.", "author": "Lori H."}

The atmosphere is pretty chill here and the decor is modernized. \n\nMy friend and I ordered the chicken oyster and chicken rib skewer. The chicken oyster is meat closer to the butt of the chicken, so it's more tender and had the skin on it. Both skewers were pretty good, but it tasted like something I could make myself at home. \n\nFor the \"finishing dish,\" we shared a bowl of udon for 2. It had an egg, vegetables, and duck. The dish itself was pretty good. The broth was flavorful while the udon noodles did taste freshly made. But for $25, it was pretty small. It was more for one person rather than two like it said on the menu.\n\nThe service here was decent.

This is not a place for a vegetarian or a pescatarian. They also forgot one of our dishes. The gizzards were over-cooked. The yosedofu (silken tofu, $7.75) was brightened by crispy scallion and freshly grated ginger and quite good. The uni don was small and poor priced for the amount of uni.\n\nThe service was poor.

It's tucked away in the Mission and could be hard to miss if you aren't looking for it.\n\nThe first thing I noticed right off of the bat was the decor and the ambiance. There is some truly amazing carpentry / wood working details that went into the build of this place. My sister said it smelled just like the hot onsens (hot springs) in Japan, and she didn't mean it in a bad way! The wood gives off such a nice warm, musky smell and it totally compliments the added aroma of grilled meat. \n\nWe ordered quite a few items: shishito peppers, gindara sunomono (black cod with cucumber salad), teba no karaage (japanese fried chicken wings) chiizu tori katsu (chicken katsu with cheese and cabbage), and some standard robata items such as meatball, thighand scallion. For dessert we had the hojicha panna cotta (green tea panna cotta). \n\nOddly enough the items that stood out to me the most were the items that I figured would be the most disappointing: shishito peppers; incredibly fresh, grilled and smokey perfection with great crunch. the karaage was OUT of this WORLD! Such a great flavor to the skin and just fried in the best sort of way. The meatball was also surprisingly full of flavor and totally surprised me.. but probably the best thing of all was DESSERT. And trust me, I am not a dessert person and I usually pass on it. But this came out in such a strange presentation that I had to try it. You pour a sort of hojicha syrup (which I suppose was suppose to be like maple syrup but infused with TEA!?) on top of the panna cotta and it just tastes divine... \n\nI would literally return just for the karaage and the dessert. I am eager to see if they will change their menu depending on the seasons. Although the meal was thoroughly enjoyable, I thought they were lacking some more interesting items on the menu so it would be nice if they did change it up a bit.", "author": "Mariko M."}

Like a cross between Muji and your Japanese Grandma's house out in the Kansai countryside.  Love the exposed wood, the indigo-chic uniforms the staff have to wear and the simplistic but very rich attention to details, colors, light and textures.  Also love that they used real Yatai yakitori grills, or at least seemed to.  Really beautiful d\u00e9cor.  Not at all like an izakaya, but spot on in terms of \"wafu\" aesthetic.  Too many beards, curled staches and tattoo sleeves for my liking, but hey, you can't turn away customers...not Rintaro's fault.\n\nUnfortunately we were disappointed with the food.  Only because we really wanted to eat real, non-fusion, un-doctored izakaya food.  We felt this menu tried too hard to be innovative when the innovation could have been to simply provide damn good classic izakaya food which, quite frankly, doesn't exist in San Francisco.  But that's no fault of Rintaro.  Just our personal preference.  For people that don't know Japanese food or only have basic knowledge of it, this place's food would've probably been amazing for them. And it was delicious, just not what we like :-) Oh, and there was no shochu.  What? Why?\n\nOnly thing that left us thinking \"hm...\" was we were there for our wedding night dinner for just my husband and I.  We had our first date in an izakaya in Tokyo, where we met, and we were hoping to pay homage to that fact. When I called to make the reservation I mentioned that it was our wedding night and the waitress was pretty emotionless about it.  I wasn't expecting freebies or special treatment at all.  I was just so excited to be booking our wedding dinner so I blurted it out, but there was no \"congratulations\" or any hint of friendliness, really - just monotonous confirmation that our reservation was for 2.  And when we arrived I mentioned it again - again, out of excitement and it was like the waitress didn't hear us.  Again, no special treatment needed, it just would have been good customer service to have acknowledged that she at least heard me.  Just thought that was a bit crap.  But our actual waitress was so lovely so that made up for that.  \n\nOf course I can't rate the restaurant on the poor actions of 1 or 2 people, especially as the place is so darn nice to look at. That's why I'm still giving it 4 stars.  I'm not giving it 5 stars because I think the menu could have been a bit more authentic.

We still waited quite a while to be seated. Much of the menu, which is very small, was sold out. The \"Shime\" which are the rice or Udon which comes at the end of the meal, we were told we could order in advance but would be put on HOLD until the end, but it came right after the appetizers. I ordered the natto with rice and the rice was not cooked. It took a very very long time for the yakitori to get served. They were extremely apologetic and said we did not have to pay for the meal. I felt sorry for them, as they were embarrassed. Of course I paid but it was not a great experience.", "author": "Mariko T."}

I was excited to have an authentic Japanese izakaya with yakitori, but found on this second visit that they've dumbed it down to appeal to the masses. I don't blame them, they have to stay in business, and I remember my original review being at odds with other diners who penalized Rintaro for their authenticity.\n\nMenu changes - no more chef's choice parts for yakitori. Straight list on the menu for two skewers each. Also got rid of the mentaiko dashimaki (think plain now, cod roe can be a bit much for a lot of folks) and no more yaki onigiri (grilled rice balls, totally awesome).\n\nThought it was odd that they ran out of tsukune (chicken meatballs) which I would have thought was the most common item to source and make.\n\nThey also forgot one of our order items, the age-tofu, a fairly light dish. We asked for the check because we were going to the symphony and they brought out the green peas croquette - it was actually quite good but the opposite style, full on fried heavy dish compared to the age-tofu... and odd dish as a complementary item.\n\nFood is still good and I think it'd be a fun place for dinner, just comes off of my list of real Japanese places", "author": "Aki N."}

It's designed to foster an immediacy and communication between customers, kitchen, manager, service staff: like a serious sushi restaurant but with chicken skewers and lots of fried things, not sushi. The design is very, very nice.\n\nI only tried one thing, the tsukune (grilled chicken meatballs on a little wooden skewer) served on a nice plate with a little pile of unusually tasty shichimi. The chicken is from Riverdog Farm (http://www.yelp.com/biz/riverdog-farm-guinda), the Binch\u014dtan (white charcoal, steamed at over 2000 degrees, invented several hundred years ago) is imported from Japan, there is no flour or egg or any other binding in the meatballs, they are made 50/50 of an especially coarse grind plus a second finer grind almost like eating little chicken nibblets. Most all ingredients here are organic, sourced from specific farms or bought at the local farmers markets. Let's just say, a lot of thought went into everything on the menu.\n\nThe boiled peanut table condiment is the best I've ever had. Edamame begone, I could make a meal of that.\n\nPrices are reasonable for this style of restaurant: $5.50-$6.50 for each chicken skewer, other apps at $5-10 a few larger plates at $15-20. This is food to go with beer, sake, soju, and good company.\n\nA special shout out to the men's room, one of the nicest in town, thanks to a classic Japanese design and a lighting fixture that shoots little shadows out across two pi radians, it's a place of meditation and comfort.\n\nIt was only the second day of service (after a soft opening the week before) and I want to try more before giving it five stars. It could go either way, but there is a lot of promise here.", "author": "Gil S."}

Authentic decor and food but with a cali twist. Super friendly and attentive staff, many of which Japanese speaking. Lively open kitchen thats a joy to watch. First time was phenomenal, second time was just good, third time was just disappointing.  The Ika salad was the only great dish we had, although very small. Delicate and refreshing with an awesome sweet wasabi inspired dressing. 3rd time having the Chizu Tori Katsu. Such a unique dish and loved it the first time. This time around the panko crust was basically the main attraction.  The chicken breast was almost non-existent and completely separated from the crust. 3 of the pieces were literally only panko crust. The salad seemed to be a bland shredded diakon instead of the dressed and flavorful cabbage and shiso it came with the first time. The yakitori skewers- Thighs too tightly packed, great flavor on outside, but when you separate the pieces and bite in, bland chicken. Breast pieces were too small, thus dried out and a bit chewy (the yuzo kosho on the side was very nice though). This was the first time we tried the UDON, great presentation but definitely lacking any real depth of flavors. Everything needed more love, care, and then some consistency. I really liked you guys!

There are many items you won't find on the menu in a typical Japanese restaurant in the US, only in Izakayas such as Rintaro: sardines \"Southern Barbarian\" style (sorry, Portuguese); whole fried or roast fish. The yakitori chef really knows his business.\n\nYou can sit in a booth, or on stools in front of the kitchen counter and watch the chefs at their work. There is also a back room, if you have a large party. Heck, even going to the bathroom is an aesthetic experience!\n\nFinish off your meal with one (or more) of the three desserts on the menu. The pastry chef is amazing, and sometimes you can watch her at work. Panna Cotta, mochi, fruit, whatever, she knows how to turn it into a delicious dessert.\n\nNow, the restaurant is not cheap.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-04", "description": "I love this place. Have been there several times now and it's become my favorite secret little spot in the Mission/SOMA area. It's a little off the beaten path (same block as Rainbow Grocery). The entry is a gated area with a lovely little courtyard in the front and you almost wouldn't know the place existed unless, well, you do. \n\nRintaro itself is one of the loveliest spaces in the city, warm and intimate but not at all pretentious. It also smells fantastic because of all the wood elements. I love taking people there because most of them don't know about it and they're always surprised that such an amazing little place exists. \n\nThe menu itself is always fantastic. They change things up somewhat every day so there are always new things to try out on each visit. Also, I've been going there since they opened in Fall 2014 and it just keeps getting better. Today was my favorite meal to date. BTW, I've been hesitant to write a review because I don't want Rintaro to become impossible to get into. But, that's kind of a selfish reason. \n\nWe ordered:\n\n1. Japanese fried chicken. Phenomenal and I hope that becomes a mainstay on the menu if it isn't already. I would have ordered more if I didn't need to save room for other things. I'm not very good at eating chicken or other meat items that involve bones (textural phobia), but I ate the heck out of these things. I do not ordinarily manage to leave behind clean bones; I did with these. A dubious accomplishment, but nevertheless, one that I'm proud of.\n\n2. Cucumbers with a miso type of sauce/dressing for dipping. Probably the weakest dish of the night but still damn tasty and refreshing, plus, needed to eat some some kind of veggie in an effort to pretend to eat healthily. \n\n3. Croquettes with chicken and wagon wheel cheese and tonkatsu sauce on the side. Perfectly fried and super tasty. They also sometimes have curry potato croquettes and I love those equally as much. \n\n3. Udon noodle soup with duck and egg. This is a new item on the menu (or at least one that wasn't on the menu on previous visits). The noodles are made by hand and while I'm not normally a noodle person (more into the broth, usually), they were delicious and chewy. Broth was amazing. \n\n4. Tamago. More flavorful and savory than most tamago (and I say that as someone who almost always orders tamago when I go to a Japanese restaurant). Sylvan, the chef, has been making them for decades and has basically mastered the shit out of them. \n\n5. DESSERTS! You wouldn't expect an izakaya to have amazing desserts but RIntaro does. A must order, even if you're not normally into sweets/desserts. Their dessert chef used to work at State Bird Provisions and received a Michelin Star when she was there. Today we had a spicy strawberry sorbet (hard to describe, but evoked strawberry pop rocks in the best possible way) and the green tea (matcha?) panna cotta, which was one of the silkiest panna cottas I've ever had. \n\nI went with just one other person today so that was all we had room for on this visit. Will absolutely be going back.", "author": "Maya B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-09-26", "description": "I came with high expectations after seeing this place on the Bon Appetite top 50 new restaurants. Decor is straight out of Shabuya and looks authentic. Menu is full of all the favorites from a neighborhood izakaya for a reasonable price. Waitstaff is friendly and seated us immediately (with a prior reservation booked 3 weeks ago). Waitress quickly placed the order and brought out cold drafts. \n\nEverything is great until the food was served. We ordered 5 assorted yakitori servings which took about 20 minutes to arrive (not a problem) but alarmingly all arrived together. The fatal flaw here is each skewer takes a different amount of time to cook so there is almost no way for a busy restaurant to prepare and plate 5 different items at exactly the same time. Every other yakitori place I've visited brings out each order individually as they are ready. At Rintaro, the first cooked orders sit for an extended amount of time waiting for the remainder of the order to be ready. As a result the breast came out dry, the thigh meat was rubbery, and the chicken meatball had mushed together. Four of the five orders came out only slightly warm as the dagger in the disappointing meal. \n\nThe concept of yakitori is highlighting the unique characteristics of each part of the chicken as individual pieces through meticulous preparation. Rintaro spoiled that with very flawed execution. \n\nFollowing the yakitori disaster we placed an order for katsu which was so delicious that we ordered a second. This does not boost the rating because a KFC can also make great fried chicken. \n\nI'm truly disappointed. I was looking forward to loving this place and having yakitori that was elevated to the next level.", "author": "D R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-14", "description": "My takeaways in two points:\n\n1) this is not really authentic Japanese food although it seems to try to be.\n\n2) I am not going to trust any top 10 list now, after I never really trust Michelin rating.  \n\n\nThe carpentry is definitely amazing.  Even in the dim night light,  the architectural plainness and subtlety still intertwine and shine nicely.   It is definitely different from a usual hipster place.  \n\nWe sat at the chefs counter just to appreciate the art of the chefs.   The owner, the head chef,  was in the center of the open kitchen, carefully and artistically displaying his skills as a chef.  I saw him peel a daikon (one of the godly existences in Japanese cuisine) with a probably a Japanese chef's knife smoothly and beautifully.   He also used the same knife on a bonito fish, and sliced it into different chunks.   He looks serene, focused, and comfortable - I am sure that this ease with the eaters' observations came after practice or the self-consciousness to overcome self-consciousness itself.  \n \n\nWhen you see \"izakaya\" in the name of a restaurant, which means an informal drinking and dining place after work for Japanese, you certainly expect more informality and more authenticity in the food.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with what we ordered.   We ordered fried chicken wings, a Yoshoku dish (Yoshoku means \"western/foreign food\" in Japanese and has Japanese variations of the western fried food and Indian curry, etc.).     We ordered yakitori, a Japanese culinary gem that is definitely undervalued in the American restaurant scene.      The last order was Teuchi Udon  - it is a statement made by the restaurant since they want to present handmade udon instead of already popular and haphazardly ramen.   \n\nIronically, what turned out to be the most impressive is the fried chicken wings, the Yoshoku/western food, since, well, obviously, it is made here by the western chefs.   The udon's soup base tastes pretty much just like soy sauce and lacks the flavor of fish broth.     The yakitori, which was so highly looked forward to, turned out to be quite ordinary -- the duck meat tastes like western steak meat.  It is between reasonably tender and reasonably chewy - but nothing special or Japanese about it besides being skewed.   The chicken breast skewer is pretty much tasteless and a little bit overcooked to our standard.   We do like the ume sauce (plum sauce) on it but wish it could have been more delicately spread on instead of being a drop.  \n\nWe did not order any sashimi or other things based on our sampling of these three orders, which did not turn out to be amazing.    It is a young restaurant and you could see that the menu is very carefully set up and seems to have a limited variety at this point.  We expected very authentic Japanese food, which is especially presented by its (fish) broth and unique handling with meat, and it did not turn out that way.   I would also suggest that the light be brighter so as to reflect better the carpentry as a great asset of the restaurant.    The front yard is very cute -  some shallots and chestnuts still in their spiky shells in two separate bamboo baskets are placed separately.   Little details like this are important.  However, while the food was served in wooden bowls and other Japanese-style ceramic containers, the chopsticks we have got are the typical dispensable chopsticks, which do not match the aesthetics or intention of this restaurant at all.   It could be a cost-saving issue, but then it certainly makes this restaurant seem overly priced then,  which serves 2 cubes of chicken breast on a skewer for $7.\n\nI could be a bit harsh on this restaurant.  Yet since I am a passionate cook and passionate about Japanology,  I could not help thinking that right now it is not the right time to try too much food there.   However, this opinion could be biased, since I did not order some of the Japanese favorites and bests listed on the menu, such as sashimi, a salad with persimmon vinegar (they have a typo on their online menu which says \"vinega\"),   daikon, japanese mushrooms ... \n\nIt is a nice bustling vibe, yet not nice enough to make me feel completely un-self-conscious.  :)  If you know what I mean.", "author": "Shuting Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-09", "description": "When Vincent K. asked the BF and I if we wanted to eat dinner, we jumped at the chance. Knowing that we wanted Japanese food, our options were limited -- that is, unless we were willing to wait. Orenchi Beyond came up as an idea, but please see aforementioned regarding wait time.\n\nThen, the BF reminded me of Chef Val Cantu's suggestion from our dinner at Californios the weekend prior and we decided to check our Izakaya Rintaro. We were a bit disappointed upon arrival to find we would have to wait 40 minutes for a table; thinking on our feet, we quickly drove over to Ken Ken Ramen to see if their seating was any better but no such luck. Having killed 15-20 minutes by this time, we drove back to Rintaro and luckily, some space cleared up in the front by the bar for the 3 of us. I was seated in a slightly awkward position, being in the middle of 2 differently leveled bar tops, but I managed to get by.\n\nUnlike other restaurants that call themselves Izakaya and don't actually serve tapa style bites, Rintaro hits the nail on the head. Chungah behind the bar ended up serving us as they were quite busy and likely wanted to reserve table tops for larger groups (speculating based on other reviews I've read). She took our drink orders and placed small dishes of pickled herring before us to munch on as we reviewed the menu. Here's what we ended up ordering:\n\n+ hanetsuki gyoza - pork potstickers, made from scratch. Beautiful presentation with a nice, chewy consistency on the dough with a flavorful pork filling. \n- yakitori tsukune - chicken meatballs; extremely tender, but I tasted lemongrass and not being a fan of that particular flavor, wouldn't call this one my favorite.\n+ liver - likely the best grilled liver I've ever had that was remained tender (and wasn't overcooked to a rubbery texture)\n + tender + wasabi - this was medium rare! Small dollops of wasabi tracked the chicken skewer which were a nice touch. \n- thigh + scallion - neutral on this dish; I bit the scallion off the skewer and the inside layers of it flew out which was a bit embarrassing for me.\n+ kabocha croquettes - breading and fry was made to perfection; I wish I could use that breading on everything.\n+ keihan - rice with chicken broth, chicken breast, and shredded egg. Extremely hearty and great for a cold day. Lots of flavor which I imagine is due to reducing the broth to achieve it's rich and dark color. We were also given a 2nd bowl because someone had misordered, gratis!\n+ tamago - large order; light and fluffy, the chef has apparently been mastering his tamago skills for several years. Served with a topping of minced radish on the side for texture.\n\nThey were out of the yosedofu (silken tofu), skin yakitori, chanterelle mushrooms, and the fried swordfish, which was disappointing. I guess next time we need to get there earlier!\n \nWhat elevated our experience was sitting at the bar, talking to Chungah about the restaurant. She made what would likely have been a good dining experience, into an extraordinary night. Her cousin runs the restaurant with the chef, who previously worked under Alice Waters of Chez Panisse, and she shared some additional background about the restaurant style and philosophy. \n\nChez Spencer used to inhabit this space, but they never reopened after a fire broke out. In fact, Rintaro kept some of the burnt wood from the fire and incorporated it into the restaurant design. Len Brackett, a well-renowned architect, had saved the cedar wood used for the bar and table tops for years and years, but finally let Rintaro's owner use it to design the restaurant. What's even more impressive is that the cedar wood hasn't been oiled and was made smooth by a Japanese planing beam. The brass bars in the bathroom and bar area were built by Chungah herself. These small touches, beautiful atmosphere, and attentive service along with the well-executed food made for a great night with the BF and old roomie. Will definitely be back and looking forward to using the outdoor area in the future!", "author": "Johanna L."}

Tons of visually stimulating elements and handmade wood work - a welcome change from the cookie-cutter rustic restaurant design everyone seems to be copying these days.\n\nDRINK: the house sake ($19 for a carafe) was delicious and a great deal.  We got about 4 glasses out of the carafe, so priced otherwise at $8/glass, the carafe is definitely the way to go!\n\nFOOD: This is where things were either major hits or major misses...we had the following:\n\nLiberty Duck & Persimmon Salad (4/5) - generous portion, the persimmons' sweetness went perfectly with the medium-rare thinly sliced duck breast, slightly overdressed/salty but still very enjoyable way to start the meal.\n\nHousemade Silken Tofu (3/5) - texture was very creamy, almost cheese-like but without the tang.  accompanied by freshly grated ginger, scallions, & bonito flakes.  I guess tasty for what it was, but really just too boring.\n\nYakitori - we ordered two skewers, chicken meatballs (5/5) and breast with ume (3/5), both were cooked perfectly, juicy and delicious.  definitely preferred the meatballs and wished we had ordered more of those.\n\nChicken Katsu (5/5) - hands down the best dish of the night, I could eat this every day!  not your traditional katsu in that they stuff the chicken with cheese, almost like the french cordon bleu. but damn, that panko breading was perfectly fried and the impossibly juicy chicken was magic!\n\nBraised Pork Belly (3/5) - this dish could benefit from a better description on the menu.  I expected something more of a stew consistency with succulent chunks of pork belly. instead you get a plate with a piece of belly that has been stewed already, but has no sauce and served with a poached egg and some boiled turnip.  the dish was hard to eat with chopsticks, pork belly was dry and at $15 the dish is way overpriced.\n\nMatsutake Gohan (1/5) - we ended the meal with this dish, listed in the \"Final Dish\" section of the menu and I really wish we hadn't!  As a closer for an otherwise decent meal, this was an embarrassing dish for a restaurant of this caliber to serve.  It was essentially a clay pot filled with rice and about sliced matsutake mushrooms.  No broth, no scallions, no ginger...no flavor.  $15 for some rice and a mushroom.  We took two bites and left the rest.\n\nTotal price for 2 people (tax+sf surcharge+tip) = $135\n\nDespite the inconsistency on some of the dishes, I would probably go back because there were several other dishes coming out of the kitchen next to me that looked worth trying.  The sashimis were beautiful and the chicken wings (and probably anything else being panko breaded and fried) are probably amazing.", "author": "R S."}

I have dined here multiple times before, and it was one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The food is amazing and the service has always been good, I always sit at the bar so sometimes it's tough to flag down your server, but usually it works out. The food is usually so good that it makes any service issues irrelevant! However tonight I had an experience that has ruined the restaurant for me. I decided to come here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend. We sat at the bar and everything was fine while we placed our order. However halfway through the meal I received a dish I had not ordered(I believe the server had been a little confused about a question I had asked),and I mentioned it to the server. She insisted that I had ordered it but reluctantly took it away. I saw that it became an issue in the kitchen, when the manager and one of the chefs was discussing what to do about the dish. From what I heard it sounded like they thought I had ordered the dish, and just chosen not to accept it when it was brought by. However that was not the case. Throughout the meal our food has been paced moderately, with us receiving one or two dishes at a time. However after this mixup we receive the rest of our order all at once. Three large dishes brought at the same time to share between me and my girlfriend, and to boot one of the dishes is supposed to be a finishing dish to be enjoyed at the end of the meal. Unfortunately the Udon was cold by the time we got to it, and our appetites were overwhelmed by the amount of food in front of us. I just hope in the future the server does not take out her frustration on a guest who is trying to celebrate his birthday with his girlfriend, and ruin the rest of his dinner.

This was our first time there, and as big fans of izakayas, we had been looking forward to this meal. Upon entering the place we were pleased with the modernist/traditional decor and the fresh plants and flowers, unfortunately for us, the hostess took us to the backroom which is probably a converted storage room and now looks like an Eastern European cafeteria. This room was as far from romantic as you could get (there was even a sink) and we asked to be seated at the bar and so were then seated at the chef's table. What followed was nothing but small mediocre plates one after another seemingly intended not to satisfy the eater but to maximize profits while pretending to look like a chef's tasting menu.\n\nFirst course consisted of one plate to share of miso paste with a couple of radishes and carrot pieces with their leafy stems in place. Meh. \n\nSecond course was a tiny piece of rolled omelette, we each got our own. Nothing special, kind of hard to screw up an omelette after all.\n\nThird course was  three small night smelts per person. Yawn.\n\nFourth course was a few bluefin tuna sashimi pieces with two oysters to share. The fish came out as if it hadn't been properly thawed.\n\nFifth course was a few pieces of thinly sliced steak and duck to share. The duck was very chewy and the two meats together made a puzzling combo.\n\nSixth course was a bowl of rice topped with steelhead roe. This was good, but hardly a dish whose flavor could be attributed to the chefs.\n\nDessert was advertised as a chocolate financier, but what we got were two chocolate madeleines. Absurd.\n\nTotal bill came out to be $270 with tip, as we had two sake flights as well. This was one of the most underwhelming meals I've ever had--not even one yakitori skewer--and it left us hungry and walking over to Mission Chinese to get the cod fried rice.\n\nA place that chooses to gouge its customers on a special day as opposed to feeding them is not a restaurant, it's a criminal enterprise and should be avoided out of principles and at all cost.\n\nDon't waste your money here and trek somewhere else.\n\nEDIT: shortly after this review went up I received a private message from someone who works at Rintaro expressing sorrow I had had a bad experience. This shows that at least one person cares, and I'll be bumping up my star rating to two, in hope that this was just some Valentine's Day shenanigans. The restaurant business is very tough, but that's why it's important that new restaurants try even harder.

And the lack of grace on the part of the hostess when we arrived--without a reservation, but quite early, just after 6:00--was amazing, particularly since the entire counter was empty. (Or..maybe the counter seats were reserved too? She didn't say.)  Others may not feel the same way, but Rintaro is now off my list of go-to places....", "author": "m n."}

The food, overall, was delicious and quickly delivered. Like many, we enjoyed the meatballs and the grilled thighs with onion. Another highlight was the sushi (mackerel, if I recall); our kids wanted to order several more of that clean and flavorful dish. The persimmon and duck salad and heirloom tomato sunumono  were also a hit. The only dish we really did not like was the mushroom rice, as the rice was undercooked and sadly flavorless. The green tea panna cotta dessert was divine. Our family now wants to move to Japan!", "author": "Hilary B."}

Slightly sketchy-looking part of the neighborhood after dark, tiny little sign on a gate that opens up like a portal into a San Fransokyo courtyard.  The interior is gorgeous, lots of Japanese-crafted wood and nature/ikebana-esque touches.\n\n4.5 stars for the food and service.  Classic Japanese izakaya food with a hipster-Bay Area approach/sourcing.  Would probably pass on the tuna tartare starter again, and the globs of dashi gelee completely overwhelmed the oysters on the half shell.  Salad was passable; the house made bergamot tofu is not for everyone, but very special for tofu fans.  \n\nMoving on through the menu, the skewers were very well executed - gizzards just the right amount of chew, chicken \"oysters\" some of the most succulent and flavorful bits I've ever tasted, chicken ume and thighs as well as the king trumpets also pretty good.  Natto-don was okay, very mild and not super fermented, as natto goes.  Really enjoyed their take on ochazuke - the broth was so delicate and divine.\n\nOur server was very nice but did have a little trouble answering some questions about the sake we ordered and distinguishing between the various chicken parts skewered on our table.\n\n4 stars for value - high quality food, but you're definitely paying for the privilege.\n\nAll in all, Rintaro was a very enjoyable experience.  Would love to come back to give it another try and finish tasting the rest of the menu (deep fried whole sole, I am definitely looking at you).", "author": "Audrey L."}

It happened to be when Bon Appetit was taking photos for their article on the top ten restaurants in the country. (Little did I know). Had a great view of all the action. Saw Sylvan cut two daikon radishes into two massive paper thin strips...very impressive skills. It was the most organized, we'll run kitchen I think I've ever seen. They have their system Down!

It just opened and a friend raved so I decided to see for myself. \n\nI love the interior. Natural woods and really nice smells. It feels pure and honest and definitely hip. Very authentic Japanese style. The bathrooms are gorgeous, the hanging lanterns cast a beautiful shadow around the bathrooms. Everything is so simple but so perfect. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, and it was refreshing for me (not knowing what I was getting into) to feel like this place spoke my values. They explained everything they served - where it came from (everything that we ate was Bay Area local and that was so neat to me), what all the different tastes are, how you eat it. For someone not so experienced in this style of food, it was really fun to learn more about this style of food and learn more about the restaurants values that seem pretty well aligned with mine. I appreciated them taking the time to share about each dish. \n\nFor drinks - SOJU! This stuff is divine. Nectar of the gods. I'm not joking! I don't know why it isn't bottled and sold at Birite (there's an idea). I would buy this by the bottle if I could. Amazing drink (plum wine). If you've ever had \"plum wine\" before you might make a face while you're reading this. Believe me - this is not THAT plum wine. This is Rintaro's soju and it will totally knock your socks off. How do I even explain it. I can't, just please try it and smile for me. This place is my new go-to for drinks because the only drink I want anymore is Soju. I'm serious. \n\nFor food - everyone was oooohing and aaahhhing over the chicken skewers. So tender and juicy. I've never had anything like it. The flavors were amazing. All the skewers came with spices and sauces. So delicious! \n\nI also loved the tamago. We ordered a million things including a fish fried whole! Everything was incredible and I have found my new spot. \n\nI would recommend asking what they recommend. I read up on the owner and he used to work at Chez Panisse. He knows what he is doing, so get their recommendation and some Soju and enjoy yoself.\n\nP.S. Love the little lovely smelling wood planks with rolled wet cloth for wiping your hands. So sweet. \n\nThank you Rintaro!!", "author": "Danielle G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-04-24", "description": "Wonderful food and concept but one star off because of the loud music and less than stellar way to be greeted and taken to a table. And since there is so much tofu and soy sauce involved, I wish they would say that they are using organic sources for that.\n\nService/Atmosphere: We had a reservation and arrived early to a 20% filled front room but were put in the dark back room, which was cold, had  strange smells and even louder bad music. We asked to be reseated. That took a long time, even though there were many open places available throughout our dinner. So, not very well run in terms of customer comfort.  \n\nThe architecture/woodwork is stunning and the open kitchen is nice. Looks like they are going for a urban hipster experience which has limited appeal and should not mean loud Japanese bar music. Maybe we were there at a poorly managed time.\n\nFood: The food was very well prepared and nicely presented. We loved both the soft and fried tofu dishes and yakitori. The chicken wings were suberb if a bit salty, but the lemon slices helped that. We did not like the mushy shumai and it seemed out of place on the menu of Japanese food. The chicken tenders were too spicy but overall the dishes we ate were excellent. Some of the nice hand made dishes were chipped already, and the (sobacha) buckwheat tea (why is that not on the menu?) was delicious but not as nice to drink from a chipped cup.\n\nMenu: I would have liked to know that the tofu was made with organic soybeans and that the soy sauce was organic. Much of soy is now genetically modified and should be avoided. Since Rintaro makes the effort to source local food and name it on the menu, it should also give customers that information. And I would expect a choice of shoyu sauce, such as tamari, a wheat free option. \n\nOver all the potential for greatness is there but I agree with the reviews that it still is a work in progress.", "author": "Violet R."}

Liholiho deserves to be one of the top 50 new restaurants. Rintaro does not. There are so many better izakayas in the Bay Area serving tastier yakitori and small dishes.

Please season your food better!!! Plus, the waitress forgot to bring us our tea but we didn't bother asking for it again. \n\nEarly Girl Tomato Sunomono: I regret ordering this dish. Not worth it. \nLiberty Duck Salad: The duck was good and overall the dish had nice flavor combo, but it also cost a lot. \nChicken Breast w/ Ume Yakitori: SUPER BLAND!!! \nKing Trumpet Mushrooms: tasty but tiny. \nHouse Grilled Fish Cake: nice grill on the fish cake. \nKaraage/Chicken Wings: not bad but reminded me of SO's chicken. For $9, I could get three times the portion elsewhere. \nRiverdog Chicken Katsu w/ Cowgirl Creamery Cheese: probably one the better dishes. Perfect fry on the chicken. \nTeuchi Udon w/ Hot Spring Egg: presentation very nice, taste was bland.

We got reservations for 9:30pm.  The decor is nice, lots of light wood everywhere with a comfortable feel. Unfortunately we were told we would have to wait, so we sat at the bar.  After 20 minutes the bartender had not even acknowledged us and we were still waiting.  Finally we were seated and offered a mini beer for the delay.  The menu seems a bit limited, compared to other izakayas I've been to.  Having just moved from LA, that is my comparison point  (and LA has some amazing spots).  I will say most of the dishes we got were executed well and very tasty (minus the green beans, which were bland).  The yosedofu was silky and light.  The karaage was some of the best I've tasted, perfectly crispy.  Our server did forget one of our yakitori orders and with the limited selection to begin with, that was a bummer.  The ones we did try were delicious, especially the skin. Our waitress also brought out the wrong dessert, the panna cotta, but we tried it and enjoyed the nutty, not too sweet sauce.

But it was so far away from even the most mediocre restaurant in America that words can not describe what we had. \nStarted with \"nasty\" green beans. Totally flavorless concoction with a walnut cream sauce.  Then a tuna \"sashimi\" dish which was ok but could have gotten a better version at any one of my neighborhood restaurants. They were out of most of their yakitori dishes except for the trumpet mushrooms, meh nothing special. Then came the fried sole which was the best dish of the evening but not even close to what was expected.

I also like that Rintaro was easy on my budget as well, bonus! As a side note, some of the friends I was with were carpenters and they pointed out the outstanding real Japanese craftsmanship that went into every detail of this place. The bar is made out of a solid slab of Port Orford Cedar which I guess is a pretty big deal and collected by wood enthusiasts the world over.

After a considerable wait, he asked one of the staff about it.
