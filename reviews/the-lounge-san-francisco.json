The Lounge at Ritz Carlton offers great food and drinks, both served with a high attention to detail. I've had the salmon here a couple times, definitely would recommend. Although their menu is relatively small since its a lobby bar, it offers a good variety of choices.\n\nWe recently went here with a party of 8 and staff was very attentive. Service was consistent throughout our lunch. Drinks remained filled and they made sure we enough bar bites while waiting for our orders.

When staying at this particular Ritz, grabbing a bite to eat is not a very easy option, because of its location on Nob Hill it would mean treking down some seriously steep hills to get to the closest cafe hence my many trips to this lounge while staying here. But  I must say after my first time eating here I was blown away. The food coming out of the kitchen is made fresh and to perfection, every detail is covered even down to the house made ketchup.\n\nThe great service you would expect at a Ritz property continues into this lounge. The staff here were on their game and made this experience a great one. Simple things go a far way, like my first server remembering me from the day before and although not serving me the second day made an effort to come over and say welcome back.\n\nSeating is very much like a lounge with a mix variety of furniture including lounge type couches to table and chairs, as well as bar seating. The feel here is of relaxing and just taking your time and is shown with the service, you are not rushed here one bit which can be a little troublesome if you are in a rush. \n\nOverall this place was a great option if you are staying in the nob hill area and just want a relaxing space with good food and great service.", "author": "Avi P."}

This would have been a non-issue had I received excellent service and amazing food. However, the food was not only completely forgettable, it was also incredibly lackluster. Everything was either OK or not even worth finishing. I've been to over 10 tea rooms in the area and I usually never have a problem finishing my food. Tables are tiny and there was barely any space for our tea pots and plates (see photo).\n\nAlso note that the photos they have on the RC website for afternoon tea are NOT ACCURATE. Look at Yelp photos instead if you're curious to see what the spread looks like. \n\nAnother issue was that it was evident their servers knew NOTHING about tea. I had 2 different servers and both of them were in desperate need of training. I asked the first server for a tea recommendation but he couldn't even answer my question. He also couldn't even describe the teas I asked about...In every other tea room I've been to, they present the spread and describe the food/dessert included in your three tiered stand. Our server didn't know half the stuff in our stand and used the vaguest words to BS his way through it. To add fuel to the fire, we barely got refills for our tea and had to flag down our servers to pay the bill.\n\nFor $65, I wouldn't hesitate to say the Lounge's afternoon tea is NOT WORTH IT. Please go to the other wonderful tea rooms nearby (ie. Charles Chocolates, The English Rose)", "author": "June Y."}

First of all, I know they don't offer afternoon tea service every weekend, and I'm not sure if it's offered year-round or only in the fall/winter.  You can check their website for dates of availability as well as fill out a form to make a reservation.  I would probably call rather than book online, though, as you can get a more immediate response that way.  \n\nWe parked at the Sutter-Stockton garage which is only a (steep) block or two away.  You will see the Lobby Lounge right as you enter the hotel.  There is no hostess podium, but when you enter someone will come over and check you in.  Their tea is expensive, but when you are there you will see why.  The ambiance is very nice, and customer service good.  They've got some really friendly ladies working there :)  And there's a harpist playing music - how cool is that?!  As for the food, can I say BEST SCONES EVER?!  So delicious!  Teas were good (vanilla bean tea, yum!), desserts ok, sandwiches though - eh.  Too fancy shmancy for my taste buds!\n\nAt about $65 (for their Traditional Tea), this is a bit too expensive to do on a regular basis, but worth the once in awhile splurge!", "author": "Carnita M."}

The seats are not very comfortable for your back - ask for extra pillows. Now the room is beautiful and I do love the classic environment. I just don't think it's worth the price for what it offers.

I talked my cousin into taking her mom too and we had a wonderful girls luncheon today: 2 sisters and their adult daughters.\n\nThe Ritz is certainly not cutesy.  It's classy.  The cute little sugared violets and beaded doiles you see at LTT are nowhere in sight at the Ritz.  It's Simple.  Sophisticated.  Scrumptious.\n\nFirst things first - where to park?!!  On this Saturday afternoon we actually found street parking right on Stockton in front of the hotel and there were two other spots right around the corner on Pine.  If we hadn't found street parking we would have parked at the Sutter/Stockton garage.  If you park here - make sure you exit the garage on Bush (it's on the 2nd or 3rd floor of the garage and not at ground level).  From the corner of Bush and Stockton you walk a short (yet steep) block up Stockton to Pine and voila!  If you're walking up from Union Square - simple: take either staircase on the left or right side of the Stockton Tunnel (on the Sutter entrance of the tunnel) and you'll find yourself at Bush and Stockton!  Anything to help my fellow-yelpers avoid paying for that ridiculous valet!!!\n\nBut you don't want to know about parking - you want to know about tea!  Since none of us wanted/needed alcohol this afternoon we all opted for the Traditional Tea for $36:\n-An entire pot of tea.  You choose 1 of 18 different teas.  Black, green, fruit, flower, decaf, herbal - they have it all!\n-Smoked salmon with pickled onion & caviar on dark rye sandwich\n-Cucumber, roquefort and walnut on white bread sandwich\n-Prociutto & melon on light rye bread sandwich\n-Egg & chive sandwich\n-Scones with devonshire cream and lemon curd\n-Various tea pastries.  Today we got: banana macaron, chocolate macaron, lemon marshmallow, almond shortbread, pistachio tea cake, chocolate cup with cream and blackberry, tiny lemon tart and tiny chocolate tart\n\nWhat I noticed the most was the quality of the food.  I come from a family of HIGHLY critical home chefs and bakers.  The only item that didn't wow this rather \"tough crowd\" was the pistachio tea cake.  For my mom and auntie to rave about food like this - it has to be done well.  Food was FAR, FAR above LTT's.  \n\nOh and the best part?... I mentioned, while making my reservation, that we were celebrating Mom's birthday.  And I was shocked when after we'd finished our tea sandwiches and pastries - the waitress brought out a complimentary order of strawberries and vanilla cream alight with 2 candles!  Perfection!\n\nThe fundamental Ritz service was evident.  I don't exactly mean the waiters/waitresses (who were satisfactory) but the overall level of service.  For example - I think we could have stayed 3 hours if we wanted to.  We never felt rushed.  No one hovered and we leisurely sipped the last of our pots of tea long after we'd finished eating.  Top that with the birthday surprise and I was really impressed.\n\nThis was worth the money for me.  I'd never take a man near those tea pots - but an afternoon with women will most definitely be repeated in the near future.", "author": "Lisa T."}

After their staff graciously gave us a tour of a few of their junior suites, we came downstairs to sample their menu. Their menu changes daily, but I recall everything I had was delicious. They served me what is now my favorite drink, and I can't seem to replicate it or find it anywhere else - the Pearadise (Grey Goose La Poire, club soda, lime juice). So crisp and refreshing! My cousin and I split the bay greens salad with walnuts, dried cranberries, gorgonzola and balsamic vinaigrette dressing. We also split a club sandwich :)\n\nThe ambiance is the essence of classic luxury...french-inspired furniture, sprawling windows facing the central garden, soft lighting. It was mostly quiet, other than the occassional \"cling\"poon against a cup of coffee. I admit, I did feel a bit out of place being the youngest women there, and the only women of color at that. Their clientele is mostly older businessmen and posh middle-aged ladies with wide brimmed hats. Very \"Breakfast at Tiffanys.\"\n\nThey earn 5 stars for their service alone.

Tea at the Ritz Carlton used to be the standard for afternoon high tea - not a neighborhood hangout, cozy and casual, but a formal sitting room with impeccable service and ambience that almost called to mind the sacred. The moment I noticed my teacup was empty was the same that a server had already arrived to refill it; all of the sandwiches and pastries were excellent and presented perfectly, and the harpist added the ideal touch to the atmosphere.\nOver the years the decline has been steady, and unfortunate. Many reasons, probably all of them valid, may contribute to this. But this last experience relegated afternoon tea to one of those large conference rooms, darkened, with portable chairs and tables and fake flickering candles. Long gaps between service have become the norm, although our server was friendly. The food was still very good, but honestly, that almost served to mock the entirety of it. The tea and food for an afternoon tea must be perfect, but an afternoon tea has nothing whatsoever to do with tea and food.", "author": "David C."}

On our anniversary this year, it seemed like a natural way to celebrate.  The service was still first-class.  The room still looked like a ballroom in a European palace.  The harpist was still there, and she was playing melodies that everyone, even the toddlers, could enjoy.  Yes, there were toddlers.  Rich people have children, too.  \n\nThere's nothing quite like having sandwiches and petits fours stacked on a three-tier service on your table.  The prosciutto sandwich was amazing!  The salmon sandwich was outstanding!  Various things like the miniature eclair and the pecan tart entertained us with their taste, both in appearance and flavor.  Reminding myself of my manliness, I ordered a tea called \"Eros,\" which turned out to have an interesting combination of flavors.  \n\nThe waitstaff made us feel like royalty, and as we enjoyed our two orders of Royal Tea (including the Ritz-Carlton's special champagne), we remembered the elegance of  our first visit and celebrated the longevity of our relationship that led to this visit.  After we thought the meal was over, the staff brought in a surprise tray with \"Happy Anniversary\" written on it around another dessert!

Well, no, not in the sense that they were expecting, not a birthday (although mine was coming up soon, but that's not why we got together), bridal shower, baby shower, (I think there was a bridal or baby shower going on that day too) or anything like that, but it WAS a special occasion for us, in the sense that the 3 of us hadn't seen each other for a couple of years!\n\nLocated on the northeast corner of Stockton & Pine.", "author": "Linda T."}

High tea in the old lovely lobby lounge, with the beautiful portraits of elegant women from the turn of the century, really set the stage. I was disappointed when the china was changed out to a more contemporary style a few years ago, but I could accept that if everything else had not changed over time. While some people mentioned the harpist, we had the pianist playing music that was appropriate for what it has become - a nice place for a cocktail. Even one of our tea sandwiches was wrapped in a TORTILLA - who thought that was a tea sandwich?? The decor is now very contemporary, which really clashes with the elegance of the Ritz-Carlton.

Sadly, we only got a scone apiece, but the clotted cream that accompanied it was good.  The mini desserts were good, but we both agreed that we would have rather had more savories and no little desserts.  The view to the back garden was nice and calm, and as with most teas, had a nice time cathing up and gossiping while eating our dainties in a leisurely manner.  Fortunately, there was no bridal party while we were there (loud squealing bridal parties tend to be a risk you take whenever you endulge in high tea), although there were some obnoxious businessmen nearby who were discussing at great length how they couldn't believe they were at tea, blah blah blah, and really sirs, you were not all that manly.

Third, it took another 20 minutes after our platter was empty to get the second serving.

Even though sophisticated attire is highly recommended, don't worry about it if you come in tattered jeans -- we will still serve you as long as you carry a designer bag.  If you don't have a designer bag, then put on one of those box hats with a flower on top, and you might just blend in with the Ladies' Hat Club members that meet here weekly.  This place is kid friendly as well -- our harpist is a complete professional in Disney theme song interpretations.  Requests are taken, but may not be recognized.  Also, be prepared for a very leisurely tea experience, as we only have one wait staff for the entire Lobby Lounge.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-04-06", "description": "About what you'd expect. A nice place to sit and enjoy an 8 dollar beer, or a 15 dollar martini, if that's what you're looking for. The martinis and specialty cocktails were great (I had a mango mate-tini which was delicious and an irish coffee which was nice and strong, with a generous dollop of thick whipped cream, but not served quite as hot as it should have been), the atmosphere is casually elegant. The harpist was good- a crowd of little girls had gathered around her, mesmerized, as she rocked out on some disney tunes. I had to deduct a star because the service was definitely lacking, we had to practically grab our waitress by both shoulders and shake her to get her attention, and she forgot our drink order, making us wait around 20 minutes for a pretty simple drink order, although they were not very crowded at all. The Lobby Lounge gets 4 stars though mostly because of the awesome fruit and cheese plate that they whipped up for us- huge slabs of delicious stilton, brie, and chevre, with elegantly sliced pears, figs, a perfect bunch of grapes fit for a Caesar, crackers, and other assorted odds and ends. Definitely a five star fruit and cheese plate, if I ever had one. The food I saw other patrons noshing on looked good too, and the sushi that they were starting to serve as we left looked amazing. I will definitely be back at some point to hit up the sushi cart.", "author": "Brian H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-10-27", "description": "My roommate and I were super excited about coming here for high tea, but we were both disappointed. The decor was nice, but the furniture looked old (not in a good antique way). The tea was too weak and the waitress mixed our teas when she refilled our cups.  The pots were big and didn't have cozies so the teas got cold fast.  The little pastries were delicious though. I'd rather go to Lisa's tea treasures down in south bay.", "author": "Carrie F."}
