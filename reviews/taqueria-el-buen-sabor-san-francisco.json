We stopped by here yesterday and ordered a crap load of tacos, I think super tacos. As for the meats, the carnitas was nice and crisped on the outside and their carne asada was pretty moist.  Unfortunately we didn't discover their hot salsas until the very end, but the red one was good.  My coworker says their green sauce is of the best in California.  Just a note that the super tacos are too stuffed to pick up with your hands, you pretty much need a fork.  Ooo the tortillas they use for the tacos have excellent texture.

After looking long and wide for a good taqueria that has amazing flavors and heart in its food I am glad that a friend brought me to this place. The menu is pretty standard but the food is where this place stands out.\n\nThe servers make sure that everything is explained thoroughly. In fact, they will tell you ingredients and taste of some of the elements if you ask.  We ordered a steak quesadilla, a chicken dinner, and nachos. For me the nachos were the winner of the nite! \n\nThe attendant first made a layer of chips, then poured cheese and refrito over them. She proceeded to put another layer of chips and then topped it with everything: crema, guacamole, and the meat. I was so grateful that she allowed me a mixed meat platter, it truly made my day. She also didn't was generous on the chicken and steak, which was awesome. This type of attitude is what other  businesses should emulate: Friendliness, good taste, great portions.

I'm currently 23 now, and this still remains in my opinion the best taqueria in SF. No other place compares in my opinion. Their steak is unbelievable, well cooked, and has great flavour. In a way, this place will spoil you. Once you try their steak either in a burrito or on a plate, you'll be left wanting when you buy competition at other places nearby. Their burritos are well priced and a very nice big size. The steak texture is just incredible and its cooked to perfection. They also have some really wonderful vegetarian options. If I had to pick my 3 favourite items on the menu it would be the steak dinner plate, special burrito, and the vegetarian burrito for when you don't want something so heavy. $5.50 for beans, cheese and rice beautifully wrapped up and it fills you up.\n\nThe service is fast, and this place gets packed on the weekends with lines going out the door. They've also been upgrading their systems over the years and currently use some really nice new cashier equipment to get you checked out very quickly. You can tell a lot of love goes into this business, and all the workers and owners band together to give you the best experience possible and accommodate customer's needs.\n\nI've been coming here for over a decade for good reason, and hope to keep coming here for decades more if possible.

I got a super burrito with Carne Asada, black beans, and spicy salsa. I was honestly expecting more of a rush of flavor, but it didn't seem to really do the job for me! It wasn't as spicy as I would have expected and the meat seemed to be bunched up so I only got bites where I could taste the meat every so often. Besides that though, it seemed pretty fine!

My coworkers and I were hanging out at Dolores Park and got hungry so we decided to look for something to eat. We initially stopped by Bi-Rite Market, but the lines were horrendous and nothing seemed too appetizing. My coworker recommended a nearby taqueria so we stopped by here instead! \n\nThe line wasn't too long, especially after a group of girls freaked out about the $10 CC minimum and left. I had trouble deciding what I wanted to eat. I walked in thinking I shall get a taco, I left with a super burrito. Haha. I opt for the lengua because lengua and cabeza are my meats of choice when I get Mexican food. I didn't see cabeza as an option. My friend got the shrimp quesadilla. Portions are big! I got pretty full 1/4 way into my burrito. Lengua was tender. Burrito wasn't too amazing though. Lacked flavor. Good prices.

We bussed our dishes after the meal and they actually had a compost bin, which was awesome! The burrito was pretty good and it was filling, but I didn't think it was one of the more memorable veggie burritos I've ever had.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-06", "description": "Overview: Taqueria el Buen Sabor on the corner of 18th and Valencia is probably one of the last non-upscale restaurants on Valencia St in the Mission District and serves small tacos, burritos, nachos, at relatively affordable prices ($2-4/taco, and less than $10 for burritos.)\n\nThe Food: I ordered the carnitas and asada tacos without guacamole and was mildly satisfied. The meat was a bit dry, the flavor profile was quite simple, and the corn tortillas were on the small side, and overall I thought it was a simple meal. The table-top green salsa was tasty but I regret not ordering the upgraded taco option that had guac and more veggies. I ended up having an upset stomach for the rest of the day but I cannot be sure that Taqueria el Buen Sabor was to blame as I did dine at several other restaurants the same day.\n\nThe Establishment: Kind of dark, not very clean, no fountain drinks or ice machine, disgusting bathroom, but a pretty good amount of seating considering its small size. Only street parking.\n\nThe Service: Knowing a bit of Spanish would be helpful here as the employees here definitely have a limited English proficiency. No table service.\n\nConclusions: Taqueria el Buen Sabor is an authentic, and affordable Mexican restaurant that serves all the traditional Mexican favorites but I both didn't enjoy the cleanliness of the restaurant (specifically the bathroom) and didn't find my meal to be particularly delicious.", "author": "Andrew H."}

She initially rang up my order to be $5.98 but without me saying anything, she looked at the description on my burrito tin foil and talked with the lady who made my order and changed it to $5.19, so I was happy to give $6 and asked her to keep the change. (Btw, credit cards are for orders $10 or more, otherwise use cash). They also scoop warm tortilla chips into your takeout bag. When I got home half an hour later, it was still warm and delicious.

The rice was mushy with muddled flavor, and the meat (carne asada and pollo asado) wasn't grilled enough so didn't have a contrasting texture to the rice n beans. Overall effect was bland and texture-less. \n\nThe horchata was from a machine, obviously a mix, and tasted that way (like the difference between frozen oj and fresh-squeezed). The chips were crunchy and fried in fresh oil (a plus) but lacked salt. The salsa picante and salsa verde were tasty, but the salsa fresca had too much onion and didn't taste that fresh.\n\nOn the plus side, the staff were really nice and (as is usual in a taqueria), efficient.

Limited seating, and it's a stopping point for derelicts - better off getting take out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-12-23", "description": "No worries if you couldn't remember the rest of this review. Just remind yourself that green salsa tastes well with meat while the red salsa bottle goes best with chips. Yup, salsa is kinda like wine if you want it to be, especially with tomatoes carrying a high level of antioxidants. It's like dat!\n\nI've passed by this place countless times. It's always on my way to other restaurants so I decided it was time to stop by. It was dinner time and their communal tables were empty but looked welcoming nonetheless. The colorful exterior is sensitizing while the location is attractive as the door points straight at the tip of the bustling corner of Valencia Street and 18th. The non-matching checkered floors, red brick d\u00e9cor, and xmas lights were not enough to distract me from turning to their hanging menu and steaming food counter where numerous meats, beans, fried goods, and tortillas options were on display. Excited by what I saw, I turned to the cashier and asked, \"What is good here?\" With lots of charisma, she smiled and responded, \"everything\", and smiled again.\n\nThe server's response was warm and assuring but not helpful for Yelpers like me who was trying to draw their finest. Eventually my order of carnitas dinner plate ($8.20) came with pork, Spanish rice, black beans with melted cheese smothered on top, guacamole, sour cream, and thick salsa. On the side were fresh chips, and four delicious hand-warming corn tortillas served in a foil. The dish was non-soggy on the dry side with pork and Spanish rice nicely seasoned and the score of black beans were on point. I thought braised pork was rough in a few spots and guacamole could be thicker. The bottles of red and green salsa at every table were helpful kicks as I took turns in trying each on everything that was on the plate. I'm more a flour tortilla person but the corn option was a nice change of scenery for my palate. The horchata was cinnamony but also diluted with a dull finish.\n\nService was friendly and my food was brought to the table even though the arrangement has self service written all over. I thought this place is a solid Mexican taqueria amongst many that are here in the Mission District. Solid 3 stars for the overall experience. I hope to come back to give them another try.", "author": "Daniel L."}

I was expecting frozen/breaded fish to be thrown in a fryer but instead, the cook threw cubes of raw fish on the griddle which was surprising. \n\nThe fish was really tender and I had to use a fork/knife to eat it. For a $3+ taco, it was pretty big. I tried their red and green salsa with the tortilla chips which came with the taco and they were both tasty.\n\nService was fast and friendly enough.

It is that classic hole in the wall with abuelitas working on the stove making tortillas and asada from love. There is a certain spice that's found in a lot of food around the Mission that doesn't agree with me. I can't quite narrow down this flavor but I don't like it. I've tasted it at Pancho Villa and a couple of other places, but not here. Buen Sabor is truly buen sabor! Es la verdad y no soy mentiroso :) The price cannot be beat and the portions are phenomenal. My favorite thing to do is get 2 tacos that come piled high with meat, cheese, sour cream, lettuce, salsa y guacamole. Pick up a brown bag of tortilla chips at the register and dip those in the taco fixins until I've eaten the taco down enough to be rolled nicely into a mini burrito. Wash it all down with a Pacifico and a Corona and I've pretty much had the perfect night of Mexican. I have been to a lot of places around the city, but this place is the one I boogie on down to from 16th St Bart or when I hop off the 14 at 18th street. Generally I judge a Mexican joint by their enchilada suace, a true craft, and Buen Sabor's is not bad at all, I would stick with the tacos and burritos though to get the most bang for your buck.", "author": "Jaymie C."}

I went in to get a burrito for take out this evening- super burrito with chicken.  \n\nI walked in on a Friday night, and they took my order right away.  Unfortunately, they took it so fast the dude walked away before I could even finish my order (which was approximately a 10 second order, so I wasn't asking for much of his attention).  I had to call him back to finish my order, and he then walked away *again* before I could finish.  At the end of the day, this doesn't really bother me too much- if you're expecting good service, you shouldn't be going to a hole in the wall burrito shop.  Then somehow this $7 burrito on the menu cost $9 when they rung me up (last I checked our sales tax plus healthy SF fee isn't ~30% so I don't quite get that).  But ok again... $9 isn't going to break the bank.  The upside to this place: the time for me to walk in the door, order a burrito, pay, and be out the door was under 3 minutes.  \n\nThen I actually ate my burrito.  Very mediocre. I have no idea how other people like this place so much.  The chicken specifically in my burrito was very strange- tasted like some funky chorizo.

I love me some tacos, so I am not complaining whatsoever, but when I find an exceptionally good taqueria it tends to be, well, exceptionally good.\n\nSo here comes El Buen Sabor. I can get a super vegetarian taco (no sour cream!) for three bucks.  With black beans, which I'm totally into. They dump some mediocre chips on top of your plate and call it a day. Right away we know it's cheap, but it's also huge! The taco fixins' pretty much fill my entire plate and it's not all lettuce. I'm way into that.\n\nHowever, the important point to be made is this: the table salsa absolutely rules. It's red and garlicy and smooth and spicy and mixed with cilantro. Tastes totally fresh and not overpowered by onions. The garlic comes forth clearly and yet meshes with, rather than murdering, the other ingredients constituting the foundation. I love this salsa. For reals. Lemme tell y'all a secret: sometimes I use most of the jar on one taco. And by sometimes I mean all the time. And it's a decent sized jar.

It was absolutely marvelous.  All of the individual flavors inside this urban food log melded together so, so, so well... and yet each was still distinctly enjoyable on its own.  The relleno in the heart of the burrito was neither greasy nor overfried; not crunchy nor limp... it was simply perfect.  And the relleno was not the entire filling either; there was still a delicious 30% or so of beans and cheese in there.  Mmmmmm.  I don't think I can imagine a better chile relleno burrito.", "author": "Eric O."}

Many taquerias in the mission throw the cilantro around; but if cilantro takes like soap to you (or worse), you'll probably love that this place doesn't inject it everywhere. I've never had a bad experience here, the people are super nice, and they encourage me to practice my Spanish in a way that doesn't make me feel like a jerk.  \n\nThis is also insanely key: they know how to roll a burrito. I don't mean like, \"Hey, welcome to [insert McTaco store name here]. I have some foil and I'll turn it into a crumpled metal bag around your sloppy food log.\" No. No, I don't mean that. I mean like, \"Hola, I am about to make sure your food stays hot and delicious by creating a perfect, intergalactic foil cylinder of amazingness for you, because I am awesome and know what I'm doing.\" That's what I'm talking about.

They serve the perfect amount of rice, beans, and meat, so that you're burrito is actually a meat burrito, not just rice, beans, and a sprinkle of meat. And the salsa is SOOO good!
