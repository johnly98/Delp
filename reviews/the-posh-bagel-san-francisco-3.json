At first I was like what did I order and wanted to change it, bc it sounds weird but it's very very tasty. Their bread is super soft to bite into, the melted Swiss with the warm chicken salad is amazing. It was a bit of a crunch from the celery and onion. They also don't put too much mayo in it which is a plus. It comes with a side of potato salad which is meh - the potatoes don't have the same texture as fresh boiled potatoes (maybe they are from a can?)\n\nI've also gotten their egg and cheese breakfast croissant and their omelette breakfast sandwich on a croissant. Wish their omelette sandwich was more customizable - apparently the mix is pre made so you can get it without tomatoes or whatever u wouldn't want. \n\nI think this place is already great but would be even better if they also focused on the freshness of all their other ingredients besides their bagels and breads.

Chicken breast lacked flavor and the slices were thin, so it was really dry/hard after being toasted. The cheese was on top (it gives you cheesey teeth when you bite into it b/c you cannot stack both sides of the bagel and open your mouth that wide, at least I can't), no veggies except a slice of tomato. I should have added on extra veggies, I wanted lettuce and sprouts.

The pesto bagel was the same, maybe using the bagels to make a sandwich masks the flavor of the bagel. The bagel sandwiches are pretty bland in general.

Since I was early one day for my shift, I stopped in here to get a bagel with cream cheese. Happy to find that they sold Naked juice, I started off with a good impression. The people working there were nice, but the bagel itself was pretty dry, even after being toasted - seemed like it had been sitting there all day. House of Bagels or even Noahs has better bagels, but it worked for the time being.", "author": "Victoria K."}

For $2.99 you get a egg and cheese \"eggwich\", for $.20 more you can have it on their pesto bagels, which are to die for!! My daughter loves to teethe on the plain bagels.

The bagel I had was cheap and tasty, which is a total plus in my book. However, the woman behind the counter was a bit cold and didn't really seem to care for the job much. I can totally sympathesize when you deal with people all day. I would definitely stop by here again if I wanted a quick, cheap bite to eat but would surely not go out of my way to stop in.", "author": "Bathrooms Only .."}

I order my breakfast there at least once a week before work, and they always screw up my order. Screwing up a bagel with butter takes some talent, but they always pull it off.

I'd had them before in San Jose, but never here.  Alas, I bought a dozen to bring to work this morning and excitedly cut one in half, stuck it in the toaster, and turned the knob to toast- medium toast.  When the little oven's bell sounded, I slathered on the cream cheese and started chowing down... and was dissapointed.  Whoever wrote that these bagels lack that chewy outside, which kind of makes a bagel a bagel, was right.  These bagels are dry and kind of like foccaccia bread to me.  The texture just wasn't doing it.  The spread was pretty good -- tomato basil, but I don't think I'll be revisiting this Posh.  I need to try the San Jose location again... maybe I just have bad taste in bagels?  Naaaah.", "author": "Sobrina T."}

Paid my $2, sat down and the bagel was ready to go immediately.  Good bagel, lots of cream cheese (note to whiners: just wipe the sh*t off, better to get too much than not enough and some of us actually appreciate it) and that's about all.

Even though they seemed a little skeptical about my request for lettuce (because it wilts in the toaster) they accommodated me, and i got a really tasty sandwich as a result. The customer service was fine, but the girl behind the counter seemed a little stressed out. Either way, we got our food pretty quickly considering there was a line. Overall, it was a good experience, and I'm glad to have a bagel place in the neighborhood.", "author": "jessica f."}

They just aren't right because they are too light and bread-y to be real bagels.  Safeway on Market actually had much better quality bagels than this place.\n\nMy bagel had a lump of cream cheese in the middle... would have been nice if they could spread it around for me.\n\nI'll give them a second try, but I'm not impressed.  To be fair, I wasn't expecting to be impressed by west coast bagels.", "author": "S S."}
