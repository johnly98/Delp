It's a dive bar, so I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt and say that they have all the features you'd expect of a dive bar, like darts, pool table, dark wood bar, etc. We had to kill some time before going over to our actual reservation at The Grid and I wanted to kill some time first. So, time was killed here with a few beers.\n\nThe restrooms are shit. But, it's a dive bar, I fully expect that. The day I went, I don't think the paper towel dispenser actually worked. Your mileage may vary.\n\nIf you're not paying with cash, expect to pay with their iPad and to sign with your finger, tip with finger, get receipt to email/SMS/etc. It's San Francisco, after all.", "author": "Russell Z."}

AJ the bartender is what makes this bar such a welcoming place. He pays his own jukebox so that his patrons can choose their music of choice. He even brings boxes of pizza for everyone to enjoy for free on select days. The selection of beers on tap is rather plentiful, and although there aren't hundreds of spirits on the shelf, the ones I like are there. Towards the back are a few couches, two pool tables, and many tv's for additional entertainment. This place is awesome. I'd recommend it to anyone in the area.", "author": "Michael C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-09-26", "description": "Well damn, if divey bars are your cup of tea, look no further. Club 93 is where you need to be - complete with a pool table, an overwhelming smell of urine from the bathrooms, and the very dark atmosphere. \n\nGenerally I like divey bars, they're usually special or unique in some way. However, the smell from the bathrooms were so off-putting that I felt like I needed to relocate. If it weren't because the fact that our bartender was very sweet and friendly, I probably would not have hesitated to do so. Luckily, the free pizza as mentioned by other Yelpers came shortly after we had sat down and this helped GREATLY in covering up the offending smell (I think this was the intention) which quietly lingered over us. Of course, free pizza means to me, morally, you gotta give a good tip, which means it's not really free; but honestly I was just glad that it was fruitful in its efforts. \n\nThe price was not especially cheap for a dive bar, but it wasn't outrageously expensive either. For its location (close to Bill Graham and a few buildings of major companies), the bar makes an okay effort to keep the prices fair. A huge bonus is that they take card with no minimum, which was one of the main reasons we ended up here instead of at Oddjob or elsewhere.", "author": "Evelynn C."}

This place is just a simple great sports bar with great beer for a great price.  \n\nTheir beer selection is probably the best in the area.  Also, they hook it up with FREE Pizza for people drinking there which is awesome.  \n\nMost importantly, it is locally owned and not part of some douchey restaurant group so some venture guy that got lucky on some app investment can tell people he owns a bar.

They've got a good variety of beers on tap - something for everyone. To note, for those that are into fruity beers they do have a few options - they have a blueberry and a strawberry beer. I'm not into beers that are too sweet but was curious what the strawberry would taste like so the bartender suggested I mix the strawberry with one of the wheat beers. I've never tried mixing beers before.. but it was actually not a bad combination. They've got pool tables which are usually full so make sure to put your name down if you want to play. Be sure to have some quarters too, I think it's coin operated. The only time it's difficult to get a table is when there's a league going on.

I thought it was going to be ghetto inside, but boy was I wrong.\n\nFor the first few playoff games, I was pretty much free loading. I would come in and watch and never buy a drink. It wasn't until I was invited to watch the game at a nicer bar (near the Metreon) that I realized nothing beats watching the game than at your home. Yes, I call Club 93 my home. Even though it is not the most aesthetically pleasing bar from the outside, it more than makes up for it with the awesome energy and vibe and cheap drinks. The owners are so nice. They order pizza for the bar and give people free shots when there is something big to celebrate.\n\nI am now a fan of Club 93 and will watch all major sporting events at this bar.", "author": "JF K."}

I went in and asked one of the bartenders if I had to get change from him or if there was a change machine somewhere for the pool table. He proceeded to tell me there was a one drink minimum if I wanted to play pool. I honestly could not believe that. I didn't have the money to buy a drink and so I left, unable to play a game of pool. The next experience with same said bar this guy I kind of know wanted to go watch the game at a pub and invited me. I was reluctant to even go in but when we walked up to the bar the door guy says. There's a private party tonight and the cover is $10 per person. So that was a no go.  Then last night I finally decide im going to splurge for the drink just to play some pool and I get to the door and the door guy informs me that it's a $10 cover again because the game is on. I didn't even plan on watching the game. Needless to say I've become fed up enough with the terrible overall unwelcome feeling Im getting from this place. I hate to think any of these things are ok with people. They need to change San Francisco back to the great place it was and ship all these people only interested in the almighty dollar off to drive eachother crazy and leave kind hearted good people to flourish in a positive way.", "author": "Connie M."}

I come here usually twice a week after acting rehearsal or a show in the neighborhood.  \n\nFirst, the beer selection is excellent.  The bartenders are quick to refill drinks.  They'll make you anything you want, not just the beer.  \n\nSecond, there is an awesome juke box and two pool tables.  The furniture is really comfy for lounging with your buddies.  And the layout of the bar is such that it doesn't feel too cramped, even when it is very full.  \n\nBut the thing about Club 93 that makes me wish Yelp had a special option for 6-stars, is the owner, AJ.  This guy is like the Sam from Cheers.  He cares personally about each of his customers, not just as patrons, but as real people, friends, neighbors.\n\nThis is a guy who on his own dime will sometimes get several fresh hot pizzas delivered to his bar to offer his customers some free treats for their tummy.  Who the hell does this anymore in 2014!?!?!  Well AJ does.\n\nAnd then the ultimate was last night.  I closed the bar out with some friends, but only after getting home did I realize that I had left my laptop bag in the bar, which I needed for work tomorrow morning.  But since the bar doesn't open until the afternoon, I was really worried how I could get it back.  Turns out I was able to get AJ's cell number from a friend, and called him.  \n\nAJ was already at home at that point, around 2:30am.  But he said no problem, meet him at the bar in 20 minutes and he would open it up for me just so I could get my laptop bag.  \n\nAMAZING!!!  Who the hell does this... in the year 2014!?!?! Correlated to the more general decline of the social fabric of America, has been the decline in truly good customer service.\n\nBut thank god for AJ, he is a bar owner who is keeping this ancient art alive an well down on 9th Street, south of Market in San Francisco!", "author": "Jeff S."}

He scored major points with this which is why I am taking the time to write a review. \n- The TVs are high quality if you're into watching sports.\n- Music selection is great AND he'll adjust the volume (i.e., he'll turn it down a little) if someone's put on a song you don't like & it's hurting your ears!\n- Oh, ya...

The bar didn't have boiled water so AJ went to the restaurant next door to get some, and made the drink happen.\n-Somebody accidentally closed out their tab on my credit card, and left with the card. AJ hunted them down, had my card back to me within 12 hours and waived my bill.\n\nNot to mention all of the other good stuff people have said: strong, reasonable drink choices, good selection on tap, not cash only, pool tables/juke box, very close to BART/MUNI, etc.\n\nOverall great spot to which I will certainly be returning.", "author": "Charles C."}

I had been here twice before about a year ago, once for a pool league tournament and another time with a couple of friends--no problem. \nThis time, I walked in and received an odd look from the bartender and another employee but I went ahead and requested a juice and quarters for the pool table. I was told that they don't give change (which seemed odd seeing they have two tables). So I went next store to buy a pack of cigarettes and $2 in quarters and when I got back, one of the employees or the proprietor (Malasa, he said his name was) told me he was denying me service. I asked him why and he wouldn't say, just told me I was trespassing. I refused to leave until he told me why since other than being a white female, I couldn't imagine what his issue with me would be. He then proceeded to call the police to have me forcibly removed. I stayed for a bit to wait for the police because the whole scene seemed ludicrous, but sadly my lunch half hour was up and I had to go back to work so I left my full name and number on a coaster for him to give to the police so that he could file charges. \nMaybe he thought I was going to shark the other players (when really I wanted to shoot some balls around alone), or perhaps I looked too techie (more like old-SF bohemian: post-playa but showered), or perhaps he confused me with one of the addicts/transients who hang on the street waiting for social services (I was showered, like I said, but I do walk back and forth on that street a lot to do Blue Bottle coffee runs and I do have a coffee/cigarette habit).

It was merely 1:10, the eve was young.\n\nI could smell robbery in the air that night and to my surprise the odor followed me into 93. Is it possible to smell immanent debauchery? I caught the rank scent of potential assault to pair with the stickup, and with this realization my senses were at their peak.\n\nBesides the tender of the bar, myself and a shadowy female standing in the very back were the only occupants. The woman faced the wall, apparently absorbed in thoughts known only to her. I scanned the bar's dimly lit interior as the vibe was tense.\n\n\"Black label on the rocks\" and I was served without a word. I spoke clearly and with energy to give notice that I was no drunken mark. The barkeep returned to his smoking pose at the door, lazily letting his exhale fill the bar as the winds blew it back indoors. Complete quiet, no music to be found.\n\nMany would tell me that sounds like a typical true dive. I know dives and I recognize what those many are referencing. This was different. Circa 1:45 a man walks, briskly heading to the back to converse with the woman who has not moved since my arrival 30 minutes prior. The back and forth was heated although I could make no sense of it. Two minutes pass before he spins on is heels and blows right back out as if in a rush to rejoin the cold, water saturated air. He moved quickly but his mental calculations were obvious while sizing me up. Metaphorically on my toes, I twice caught glimpses of his companion poking his head through the door frame looking for I know not what.\n\nThe clock informs me we're nearing bar close, and the shady types know damn well a watering hole like this is likely to cough up at least one patron handicapped by alcohol out onto their streets. Those willing to brave the morning hours in such inclement weather are not usually the types you want to cross paths with.\n\nI down the last touch of black label from round two and decide that it's time to see what I'll find between this bar stool and my bed. I leave the bar, feeling the barkeep's eyes on my neck along with the woman still standing in the rear. The wind hits me with a vengeance, as if to punish me for leaving it to begin with. I am alone on the street and begin my trek home, the entire journey feeling something just out of sight. \n\nAn odd night indeed, and Club 93 was the core of it. I cannot put my finger on exactly what was amiss, like looking at art where the proportions are off ever so slightly as to drive you insane, one fraction of an inch at a time.  I'm fairly certain something almost happened to me at or outside Club 93, those gut feelings you hear talk of in the movies. The ones that either save the lead role or seal him or her to an unseen fate. Doomed, if only he'd listened to his gut. \n\nI won't soon forget the burning stares of the bartender and shady woman upon my departure. Perhaps next time it's the rain drenched morning hours I'll go again and test these murky waters. I always have been one to chase after mysteries.", "author": "Justin N."}

I've got some time to kill although I really should be heading back to the holiday inn so wtf I figure how bad can it be. Yeah I read the reviews and  I'm prepared for a surly owner to treat me badly. I go in, order a lagunitas at $5.50 which comes quickly in a nicely frosted mug. No issues there. A new pool game is starting at one of the two tables. Some idiot is going to break while holding an open umbrella in his left hand. Needless to say he barely knocked anything apart. Crappy Mexican fiesta music is blaring and I'm  racing through that lagunitas before the frost is off the mug. A couple of clowns are drinking tequila beyond their means and throw their limes behind the bar - the bartender has looks to kill but lets it slide because they have friends paying good money for the juke box I guess. A guy is trying to hustle a way-too-drunk 50 something home before she barfs. Pearl Jam gives me a little relief from the mariachi followed by Queen Fat Bottom Girls. A 10' Christmas tree well decorated is by the pool tables and that's the closest thing to agreeable I can spot in the place. Get tf outta here cuz the crappy fiesta music is playing again and the oh so depressing holiday inn is so much more attractive.  \nProbably won't come back unless ... Can't think of why this dive bar aficionado would ever step foot in here again. \nTime to go.

I explained I was paying for it. To make a long story short, AJ tells a bartender to kick me out. He has been known to be a tyrant, but people do not bring it up because the bar is convenient. I understand no one wants to rock the boat, but that is a terrible way to treat people and people need to be aware how AJ treats people. Be aware.

We showed up last night because we were trying to get out of the house for a couple of hours and this is the closest bar to my house that isn't specifically a gay bar. Next time, go to a gay bar, or the Bloodhound!\n\nSo, the bartender was super drunk when we arrived at 10:30. We ordered 2 beers, 2 shots, which came to 23 dollars. Overpriced, but I payed it. The bartender insisted I buy her a shot, I thought, instead of a tip? no, she wanted me to buy it and tip just because she was flirting with us. Awful. I'm married, wearing a ring, and this was inappropriate. \n\nBut, we never got a shot for my friend who I was with so he went down to come and get it because we couldn't get her to come down and serve us. He finally made that happen, she came back to us, insisted I buy her another shot and tried to charge us another 10 bucks for the shot, which by the way was a bad pour.\n\nTwo things to keep in mind here, the whole time the \"bar owner\" a sleazy leather jacket and cologne Arabic fellow (I'm half Syrian, this guy was probably Moroccan or a Saudi) hovered over us and the bartender. I can understand why he was trying to watch her so closely as you will hear momentarily. The other thing is that before this all happened I saw the bartender buying airplane bottles and drinking them in the Go-Go Market next door to the club at 6 PM!!! Not a good sign but here's what happened next...\n\nThe bar manager asks us if we're running a tab, I said no, that we paid in cash. He then kicks US out of the bar! Saying \"if you don't want to pay for your drinks you can leave\". What a joke. This is the LAST  TIME I WOULD EVER EVER COME HERE.\n\nThe thing that gets me is that the bar manager (i think) thought we were running a scam with the bartender. She obviously pocketed the money and didn't ring it up. Plus, There were plenty of crust-punks there, with their discharge butt flaps and pit bulls drinking pabst, probably for free... ok by me but he made the mistake of lumping my friend and I in with them and the bartender just because we had tattoos.  \n\nIn short, this place is discriminatory, stupid, I want an apology from the bar manager as he obviously has no idea what he's doing. And can't tell the difference between a scamming homeless crust punk and a respectable guy with some punk rock tattoos. The bartender, I think she said her name was \"Dees\" is awful and has no business behind any bar. Not only does she owe us an apology, but our money back as well. She's a local and you can probably find her at Zeitgeist (but not behind the bar! Probably throwing herself at some dude she barely knows for drinks! At least that's where my friend thought he recognized her from). Awful.\n\nSo, we left, went to the Bloodhound at 7th and Folsom (a great place) and finished out our short evening in peace and in a fun and respectful atmosphere. I can't say enough good things about the Bloodhound. Go there instead. http://www.bloodhoundsf.com/ Alright, hope you got some humor out of this.

I am not much of a drinker and Ajay doesn't seem to mind, as a matter of fact when, on the off occasion he is out of diet soda, he doesn't seem to mind if I go to the bodega next door and buy one there. When I do drink the prices are reasonable (for San Francisco). Ajay always welcomes our group of jovial improvisers into his bar and even orders pizza for everyone. He is good at keeping the riff raff out, which is appreciated. There is pool, tv and a great jukebox (musical selection varies depending on who is paying).

That is just an accident waiting to happen.)\n\nThey've replaced my free (um, I mean $2... ha) Coronas with FiDi prices ($4 for a PBR?  Are you high?)  And, REPLACED my HOT Monday and Tuesday night husbands with some cheeky BEE-YOTCH who takes 20 MINUTES before she brings you a damn beer.\n\nSeriously - my friend P and I went there a couple of weeks back before going to a concert at Slim's for a beer and we had to wait 20 minutes before she noticed us and then it took her three tries to get two  BOTTLES OF BEER correct.\n\nFurther, she left an Andrew Jackson sitting on the bar for something like 30 minutes before I finally walked up to the end of the bar where she was doing shots w/her skanky friends and said, \"Listen hon' - we've been sitting down there waiting for you to take our money for the two beers we finished almost an hour ago - if you don't cash us out now we're just going to assume that they were on the house.\"\n\nBoo to the new owners, BOOOO.\n\nThey should get NO stars -- but, I'll give it two stars.  And, that is only because I hear that Elijah still *occasionally* works there on random weekend nights.\n\nBOOO!", "author": "Kate R."}

Sixth & Mission was the best spot for slummin' 24 yr old Bukowski poseurs. Lloyd's (now Playbar) offered 20 oz Natural Lights for a dollar.  The Club Charleston (now Arrow) on Fridays represented every possible mental illness, and it was a LOT of fun. \n\nLater on, we ran an improv jam south of market and would pack Rich's Club 93 afterward and i realized the only thing keeping a dive from total chaos is the service. Rich's was great back then. \n\nI recently went back to Rich's.  How can a dive bar go downhill? Well, if there's no bar-back, and the bartender is too wasted to function, empty & half-empty glasses fill the place. The junkies are still there, pathetic as ever, but they're not taken care of either. Two dartboards take up the whole front half of the bar, so basically, you almost have to walk through darts to enter the bar. Brilliant!\n\nNormally I'd say \"If I could give zero stars I would\" but this is a bar, the pint glasses had mass and did not explode spontaneously, and there weren't any moths or insects in my beer. So for that, I'm comfortable with the one star.", "author": "Sam S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-03-10", "description": "While the crowd I went with certainly made the night a good one, there's nothing to this bar that makes it particularly enticing.\n\nThe bar itself is pretty large, with pool, a Dracula pinball game and bump shuffleboard. The decor is dark and primarily black while accented with chest level rope lighting, which kept the place unevenly lit and too bright for a dive.\n\nThe bartender is slow to take your drink order but quick to go out for a smoke while there's no one else behind the bar. Even after you get the drink anything on tap is watered down and slightly over priced. There was some free entertainment when the floor directly above us caught fire, but despite the juke box's selection of standard top 40s hits there was not disc with Fire Water Burn by the Bloodhound Gang. That would have made my night.\n\nA decent layout and bar games don't make up for the poor service, poor drinks and bad lighting. While not terrible, there are a lot of other dives in this city I would rather spend my money at.", "author": "Keith M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-03-11", "description": "Twas a weird hour I spent in this joint...\n\nI was already drunk when I came down from my hotel room, intent on going to Burger King for onion rings (the only reason I was going to eat said rings was for their fart power, which I intended to release up on my buddies who'd wimped out upstairs.) But, BK was closed so  I decided to swing over for a drink.  I was drawn to Club 93 because it was the only open bar I knew of in the area, and because the name of the place, about which I was actually mistaken, appealed to me.  Due to a scrawled sign above the door, I initially thought it was called \"Shuffleboard\"\n\nThe bar was spacious and empty, dirty and bright... all of this in an oddly appealing way.  The bartender was nowhere to be found, but there was a big crazy dude at the end of the bar (bonus) and a hot girl sharing a drink with what appeared to be her husband.  When I heard that her friends were going to be joining them, I decided I'd wait for the bartender.  The tattooed drink maiden eventually emerged a good 10 minutes later from her crack-smoking lair in the back.  She was friendly enough, but definitely zonked.  When I later got the bill, I was surprised to find the total was accurate.  \n\nEventually the hot girl's friends came, and they were all attractive lasses, which enticed me to stay on for a bit longer.  Also, I didn't want to go to bed so I stuck around a bit.  Things never got interesting and the time spent there would fall into the \"filler\" category of my life's unmade tv series.\n\nOverall this place is a dive's dive and I'd recommend it if you're going with a group. There is pool, a juke box and a shuffleboard table (which was covered when I got there) and doesn't seem to be populated by hostile locals (I didn't get any mean looks, only curious ones)  The booze selection isn't amazing but you'll find something you'll like.  Unfortunately, waiting 10 minutes, just to see the bartender, is lame no matter what the place... be it a crowded hot spot or an empty shithole.", "author": "jorbi p."}

I live in the mission and don't wander these streets all that often on my own, so for the first few days I simply walked by peering inside to try to get a vibe. After a few days a friend and I decided to go bar hopping on a random Tuesday or something (this is normal for us) to bars we'd never been to in the area. We hit up some swanky place on Minna first (his choice) and then went to Club 93 after (my choice). It was awesome! The bartender and owner were friendly. Service was good. Drinks were cheap, and music was on the spot. Ever since then, I've been back just about every night to get a quick night cap. Every time I go in there I meet nice people and feel comfortable, safe, and welcome. I have since requested a few different friends of mine to join me at Club 93 for a drink or a quick game of pool. We always leave with smiles on our faces and money left in our pockets.

It's sign says it's \"In a league of it's own,\" and they couldn't be more right. This place is around the corner from my house and my brother and his best friend discovered it when they went to buy $2 40s, but the convienience store was closed. The next day I found out they hung out all night with a man who had SIN tattooed on his neck, had shots bought for them by a bum, and almost got in a fight.\n\nI had to see this place for myself. In the 2 times I've been back, (once with my bro and once with my female roommates) here is what I've witnessed:\n-After running out of pitchers, I was served Budwiser in a blender.\n-The bartender microwaved a huge Gladware container of pasta and served some of the less fiscally blessed patrons.\n-She also kept leaving the bar to play pool, so she let a regular step behind and do her job.\n-After having numerous drinks bought for us by a gay man with terrible breath and his boyfriend, the two regulars promptly walked out on their tab.\n-Never once was I asked if I wanted to start a tab, it's kinda just assumed.\n-My bartender made us free buttery nipple shots, for dessert, I think as a present for being the only women in the place.\n\nThe list goes on and on.

If it's not half a block from your work, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way. But, but the main draw was the shuffleboard. Shuffleboard is fun, and not many bars offer the shuffleboard adventure. So I convinced my roommate to meet me for drinks after work one day and shuffleboard session. My roommate claims this is the diviest bar in SF and possibly on the entire west coast, but that may be a slight exaggeration. I digress. The shuffleboard table was covered with all types of sh*& that the bartender and another patron nicely helped remove and get this thing up and running. It looked like it hadn't been in use for anything except leaning on since the late 70's, but it was a shuffleboard table. The great search for the pucks to play took about, oh another 20 minutes. But then it was on. Pretty intense game ensued. I came out the winner I believe.
