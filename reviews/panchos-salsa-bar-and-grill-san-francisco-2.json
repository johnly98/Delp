We ordered what we always order 2 chicken Tostadas TOGO and Large Gauc with chips. At first they forgot to give me my order of large chips and gauc, then the guy didn't want to give me chips because they were low on chips. WTF? It's 8pm on a Friday night. Not my problem. \n\nThe tostada tasted like old nasty fryer oil. Couldn't eat much and made me sick. I sent a message to the business but they never responded to me.

The prices are misaligned with the meat options, so I was unable to figure out what prices correspond with which. Since there were 4 meats and 4 prices, I figured I could just match them that way, so I ordered the chicken burrito, since I thought that would be the cheapest. But they charged me a price one dollar more than the cheapest price. So either I didn't understand how the menu was aligned, or they charged me differently from the menu posted in the restaurant. Either way is bad. \n\nThe burrito itself came out piping hot, but is pretty small, maybe 2-2.5 inches in diameter. It goes well with the salsas available in the restaurant, but it's not a huge meal by any means. The chicken was fairly flavorful, and did have a good grilled flavor. The burrito isn't overly dry or overly wet, so it does have that going for it; it just doesn't have anything outstanding.\n\nOverall, it's one of the cheaper options in the neighborhood, and you can just stop in and grab a relatively quick hot meal. The burritos are a fair size for lunch, but they're probably not going to fill you up. It's nice to have this option in this location filled with much more expensive meals, but I probably wouldn't try this place if it was out of the way.", "author": "Eric Y."}

But I do like Americanized Mexican food as well. It was just a little disappointing when I was craving the authentic version, this place didn't pull through.\n\nI ordered the taquitos meal. It came with 3 taquitos. I asked them to put no onions, but they said it was pre-made and all they have to do is take them out of the freezer and fry them. Red flag right there. When I took a bite into one, the chicken was SUPER dry and very bland. Thank goodness it came with rice and beans. I dipped the taquitos into my beans and rice before each bite. It made it less dry and more flavorful. \n\nI also ordered a bean and cheese burrito. It was tasty and delicious. The disappointing thing was that they overcharged me by $2.00. I showed them the price that's hanging above their heads and the lady says that they raised their prices. Super misleading. \n\nAlso, when you leave the restaurant, you end up smelling like old oil and it will stick on to your clothes and your hair for the rest of the day.\n\nI will not come here again.

Take, for example, the big giant fish and a tiki mask on the walls. There is a decent amount of seating behind the grill, and a couple of seats outside.\nThe food is not bad. The menu offers everything you're looking for from a Mexican counter (burritos, tacos, quesadillas, tortas) at reasonable prices. There is also a self-service salsa bar. I usually get the salsa verde.\nMy usual order is a Chicken Burrito, w/ rice, beans, cheese, salsa, sour cream & lettuce in flour tortilla, for about $7.

I don't know what the cashier's issue was, but right from the start she had an attitude for no apparent reason. She seemed to be bothered by any questions asked. It wasn't enough to dissuade us from ordering but it was noticeable and added to the whole sub par experience.\n\nNext up and most importantly, the food. I'm not sure how you can mess up something as simple as a burrito but Panchos has managed to do just that. 3 burritos were ordered and all had the same issues. All 3 were practically bean and rice burritos. The portions are large but for the price I'd expect more then about a table spoon worth of meat. We kept on eating the burrito hoping maybe a pocket of meat was hiding somewhere but no luck. Just a whole lot of beans, rice, salsa, oh and lettuce. Not sure what the deal was with the lettuce. It wasn't terrible but no where on the menu did it mention there would be lettuce in it. With that said, the beans and rice were extremely bland. No type of flavor at all. I've had canned beans that had more flavor then these. So it's a burrito filled with a whole lot of tasteless beans and rice and extremely little meat.\n\nAll in all the place was clean and the food was edible so I guess that warrants 2 stars but I would never come back nor recommend it to anyone I know. We ended up throwing out at least half because it just wasn't worth eating. I'm assuming there's not many taquerias in the area because there's no way a place with food as bland and overpriced as Panchos should still be in business.", "author": "Sophia B."}

And as long as meat is greater than others, I'm all good. I will note, however, that the distribution of everything is less than ideal.

Stale chips, salsa with no level of measurable heat, and a sad plate of nachos later (with barely any slab of refried beans), I regretted my decision whole-heartedly. The only thing I can say about this place that is slightly positive is that the cooks are quick. Otherwise, the food is really lackluster, and the prices are higher compared to the Mission. Go elsewhere. Gordo's (which is about 18 blocks down) is way better. But since you're already in the Richmond, just get Asian food instead.", "author": "Danny C."}

Their dips and the head cook's sporadic bursts of Spanish opera needs some major adjustments.\n\nI ordered the \"Veggie burrito\" with a small horchata.  The sum was $9.72.  Unlike most taquerias 'Veggie burritos' made with rice, beans, and salsa or 'Supper veggie' that includes guacamole and/or sour cream, Pancho's has their own version.  It includes mushrooms, broccoli, bell peppers, and squash.  Nice twist!  Size-wise, it was equal to a 'super' and was d-lish.  It keep me chomping until gone.  Their salsas and other sauces however, weren't to par.\n\nAt their salsa bar made readily accessible to patrons (as opposed to being stingily held hostage behind their counter) they had pints of pico-de-gallo, salsa verde, pickled veggies, and diced onions w/ cilantro to pick from.  The salsa verde as runny as water and the pico-de-gallo wasn't busting with freshness.  Also, they're kinda skimpy with the complimentary chips.  You're welcome to ask for more but I've been used to having a bowl-full elsewhere with all my orders. They're also not fresh; a bit over salted. \n\nThe cook, a man who seems knowledgable about making quality foods, doesn't bare the same intellect when it comes to maintaining a merry dining environment.  He sporadicly signs along with a Hispanic/Spanish language radio playing throughout business hours.  The cook attempts to match the artist's grander by mimicking a Spanish Lucciano Pizzichini. Its kinda annoying as he's not good at it. \n\nAs for cleanness, they seem to be on the ball.  During my 2 hour dine, the staff would swing by previously occupied tables and mop em' down with cleaners, NOT just water.  She'd also mop the floors every now and then too.  Clearly, there's enough regular foot-traffic to keep the place relatively sparkly.", "author": "Honest J."}

Pancho's has been a favorite destination of mine for years. I always have the same order (because it's just that good).  I would eat at Pancho's everyday for dinner, if allowed. \n\nBecause of my obsession with Pancho's, the girlfriend refuses to come with, BUT luckily for me I have a weird friend.  One day, I decided to invite him to Pancho's with me for a burrito. This changed his life radically! Ever since then, when I need a buddy to come with, I call him up. This guy is willing to drive half-way across the city to indulge in the wonderful food Pancho cooks up. And yes, in the rare occasions that he is unavailable, and I'm craving some Pancho's, I will go alone.\n\nMy order and my strong recommendation for anyone to try is this. Just walk in a read this exact line to the server: \"Hi, I would like the Combination number 2, flour tortilla, please.\"  That's all you need to say and you will receive the absolute best Mexican food. The combo #2 we just ordered is a regular burrito + chicken quesadilla. The plate arrives with chips and guacamole as well. As a beverage, I would recommend Corona as everyone knows Corona is best paired with burritos and quesadillas. \n\nNow, I must admit that I have never (in all the years) ordered anything aside from the Combo #1 or #2. It's because this is truly the perfect combo.  While I'm sure the other products are great, I've never tried them. \n\nThere is a difference is quality depending who the burrito maker is.  Sometimes the burrito arrives wrapped in foil, sometimes not.  Some burrito makers wrap better than others. If you show up for late night dinner, you will probably have a better burrito simply because Pancho will be less occupied with other orders.  \n\nIf you prefer, the order can be varied slightly to the Combo #1, where the chicken is placed in the burrito rather than the quesadilla.  Also, I've heard that other Pancho's locations are not as awesome. Never tried them. But if you have or haven't, give this location a shot. You will not be disappointed.

But who cares? It's the freshest tasting California-style Mexican fast food I've had in the city. Baja Fresh should be so worthy of the title.\r\n\r\nLocated opposite the big Pier One Imports store on Geary, it attracts a busy lunch crowd even on the weekend. I can see why. My friend and I had a great experience when we tried this place once, so we decided to go for it again since we were in the neighborhood. Well, actually we weren't...we just got tired of Lucky Penny. The menu is pretty robust, but our eyes were focused on the combination plates, both at $6.95. I had the #1 - two grilled steak tacos on homemade corn tortillas with fresh guacamole and a side of refried beans and a small salad.\r\n\r\nI have to say the tortillas were small compared to other places (I'm thinking of the superb El Zocalo in the Mission), but they just came out of the oven, I think, and they were soft and delish. The ingredients were incredibly fresh. My friend had the even heartier combo #2, which is a combination of a chicken quesadilla, a rice and bean burrito with homemade chips and guacamole and a salad. What a deal! Of course, they have the salsa bar with the sneeze guard. Very fresh, especially the mild red one which my friend used by the shovelful on his plate.\r\n\r\nThe decor is pure Tex-Mex cheese with a touch of Wal-Mart, especially with the autographed Julio Iglesias photo next to the serapes on the wall. But who cares? The service is pretty quick, and you will feel sated in a good way here.\r\n\r\nFOOD - 4 stars...Ay! Yi! Yi! Yi! Muy bueno, senors y senoritas! \r\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...to all the girls I loved before\r\nSERVICE - 4 stars...muy rapidamente\r\nOVERALL - 4 stars...is that a burrito in my pocket, or am I just glad to see you?", "author": "Ed U."}

First impression i had when i stepped into Panchos was the cleanness, open kitchen, lots of seating, salsa bar & wide variety of choices on the menu. I finally decided on the Fajita Chicken Burrito (i love grill onions and peppers!) and the BF ordered the Chicken Burracho Burrito. The manager was pretty nice and friendly. He was also helpful because we were literally standing in front of the menu for the longest time trying to decide what to order. \n\nOur meal was tasty -- nothing special but still very good. Our burritos was packed with lots of pinto beans, meat, and cheese even without the rice. I would definitely try Pancho's again and i would like to try their soup because it seems like EVERYONE was ordering it. \n\nMental note: ORDER THE SOUP NEXT TIME! :)\n\nPs.

The place was absolutely packed full of little kids and their parents.  Like a full on mommy and me meet up going on there.  Not a fault of the restaurant and doesn't contribute to the negative ranking but still a bad start.\n\n2. We order our food and drinks (horchata and a glass of water) and after paying for it I kind of stand there waiting for him to give us our drinks and the waiter stares back at me like what do you want.  My gf asks him for our drinks and he pours the horchata for her and then walks away.  We decide not to make a big deal of it and just split the horchata so we go get a table. \n\n3. I take a sip of the horchata and it has chunks of what I'm hoping is brown sugar in it but anything milk based should not be chunky and we go to take it back. Now I normally have a policy against returning anything at a restaurant but I thought they should be aware of what we just experienced so it doesn't happen to anyone else. We let them know about the chunks and one of the guys pours some more horchata in a cup tries it and says its fine.  We throw ours out and ask if we can just have some waters.\n\n4. We are given one cup of water for the two of us but whatever, we go back to our table I take a sip of water and realize its carbonated water which I hate but at this point I'm already over it and discussing how ready I am to give this place a one star review on yelp as soon as I get home and the only positive thing during our trip happens.\n\n*Another kid working there realizes we were given carbonated water asks if we would rather have regular water and if we would each prefer our own cups.  He also apologizes for the horchata.  As much as I want to give this place 1 star I do very much appreciate this gesture and they get an extra star for it.\n\n5. When we get our food I dig into my carnitas tacos and I actually have the opposite complaint I normally do.  Meat being the most expensive item is usually what is lacking at most shitty Mexican spots.  This taco is all meat and the other ingredients are almost non-existent.  I mean I'm like me some carnitas but the only other thing on it was a tiny amount of cheese I couldn't even taste.\n\nIn other news their hot salsa is very spicy which I appreciate but had no flavor although their medium salsa was very good and my gf liked her burrito.\n\nTL;DR: Maybe you will have a better experience than me but I will never come back here again even though its the only Mexican food in easy walking distance from my place.", "author": "Ryan C."}

And then, I procrastinated on giving this place a poor review, as I many times wanted to.\n\nTherefore, the good news is I can now quit procrastinating on writing a bad review of this place and finally write a GOOD one, since I have now continued to come here enough times in the past few weeks that I have come to appreciate the finer things on their menu, such as the Borracho Burrito (chicken or steak, black beans, cheese, guac, \"Mexican BBQ sauce\", and rice on a chile-flavored tortilla), or their Two Taco Combo Plate (chicken or steak, comes with rice, beans, salad, and chips).\n\nThese are good, hearty, and solid meals that fill me up quickly at the end of a long day. Easy on the wallet, too. I appreciate the salsa bar, with three main distinct salsas ranging in heat from mild to hot; and by hot they do mean hot.\n\nNow, you may ask skeptically, \"Why the change of heart, Anna S.?\" And I will tell you: I came here at first because it is the closest place to get a burrito near my new place.

It's pretty much the only Mexican food joint for anybody who lives in Laurel Heights/almost Inner Richmond (what I call the blocks before you hit Arguello.  Seriously, between Masonic and Arguello, we really lack identity).  \n\nI used to love Gordo's, but realized that their burritos are what they do well and I have gravitated toward tacos, probably for life.  Pancho's does tacos yummy.  Me likey.

You can find fried rice and beaded house slippers in just about every store window in this area of town, but not as many burritos. But I will not make the mistake of judging a taqueria by its neighborhood again. Try the Borracho burrito. Sweet, Mexican-style barbecue sauce over the meat of your choice along with rice, guac, and beans, all neatly tucked in a festive chile tortilla. If I could develop the power of flight, I'd soar over to Portland with the Borracho as my stratosphere snack, knock on the door of the junky Mexican joint near the freeway exit, and say, \"Ur burrito, ur doin it wrong.\"\n\nAn argument involving color, valor, and all the truths we learn during preschool art experimentation arose, but I'll spare you that, too.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-26", "description": "Pancho's has a lot going for it.  The fact that I live right next to it won't affect how partial I am to the review, honest.\n\nFirst and foremost, the chips are GREAT.  As much as I adore Taqueria Can-Cun and El Farolito, their chips are awful, and yes: this does make a big difference with your order.  Theirs are homemade, thin, and crispy - sometimes, I get a craving for their chips and salsa as much as I get a craving for a burrito itself.  They've got just enough salt, but don't leave a film of micron-thin salt crystals on your fingers like Can-Cun or El Farolito's do.\n\nWhich leads me to the second point: their hot salsa is worth the cost of entrance alone.  God damn, is it awesome.  They could jar the stuff and sell it.  I sure as hell would buy it.  I'd drive across town to the one place that sold it to buy a jar, I really would.  All their salsas are homemade.  The medium salsa is a bit weak, but still has a good flavor to it.  The salsa verde is quite good as well; somewhat spicy, tangy with the tomatillos fully pronounced.  The pico de gallo is pico de gallo: fresh.\n\nThey also have a creamy chipotle salsa to die for, but you have to ask for it.  if you ask them, they'll put it AND the hot salsa in the burrito.  Do this.\n\nThird: their burritos are wicked good.  Seriously.  Their rice is tastier than any other taqueria rice I've had, and the quality of their dairy (sour cream and cheese) is better than most other places, too: the sour cream is much thicker than the viscous stuff they whap in tortillas at most other places.  The cheddar is mild but has flavor.  Despite the full-flavor of their dairy, their burritos aren't greasy - my only real gripe with Can-Cun and El Farolito.  Thier burritos are amazing, but the food coma is something else, and it feels like that greasy burrito is in your stomach for the next thirty-odd hours.  Pancho's are light, but not in that yoga-mat sort of way.\n\nThe only gripe I can possibly come up with about their burritos is that they're a big less fat than a Mission taqueria's.  That said, though, I've never felt like I was missing out on portion size.\n\nThe atomic burrito is great: a burrito mojado in a chile tortilla (which doesn't taste any more or less spicy; it's more for aesthetics, I think) and lathered in a spicy enchilada sauce.  Definitely worth a go once or twice.\n\nAnd now, if I can just step up on this soapbox a moment...\n\nThere are multiple reviews here that give the place one star and mention the clientele as part of the reason they don't like the place. It's in the Inner Richmond: people here have families, so don't be shocked if there's *gasp* A CHILD!!! sitting in a booster seat at one of the tables.  If you don't like that, there's a bar to the left wall you can sit at, or you can just sit at a table further away.  What's up with people here hating kids?  I actually like the mix of clientele here; it's the closest thing to an intercultural San Franciscan hugtime circle I've seen.  Everyone loves Pancho's; why don't you?  Is it *because* everyone else loves them?  Look, man: it's okay.  We *all* love Pancho's.  You know you do, too.\n\nAlso, the staff: everyone there is wicked cool.  I go there often enough and know them all well enough, and they're all good dudes.  Now, if you come at them like an entitled San Franciscan yupster food snob, they'll probably be less apt to be as prompt as they could be.  Plenty of times, some bespectacled, bald fellow in a $500 scarf has been up there and said in a wallowing vocal gait, \"....sooooooo... I'm kiiiiiinda thinking of getting a carne asada burrito... buuuuuttttt.... mmmm... yeeeeah, how's the chicken today?  I'm only looking for white meat, mmkay?  I don't want to see any brown spots unless it's from the spices.  What sort of spices do you use?  Do you use mapuche spice?\"  Look, man: this is a taqueria, not a suicide chat line or a monosyllabic-titled gourmet sit-down in Soma where the waiter went to finishing school in Marseilles.  Maybe to you this seems normal, acceptable behaviour for lunchtime rush but 'round here, it's not.  That said, I know when the tall dude's prom is because he's all about preparing for it (he asked where I got my suit); I know the shorter dude likes Hondas because he asked if the S2000 outside was mine.  \n\nJust be cool.

I visited Pancho's again today for lunch, and I am still very impressed with this place.\n\nThe menu is front and center, easy to understand. I went for Combination #2 for $6.95 with a chicken quesadilla, small bean and rice burrito (I don't know what was small about it - bigger than those frozen microwave burritos from Safeway), chips, and guacamole with shredded lettuce. Add in a large diet Coke from the fountain, and my bill came out to $9.17.\n\nThe food was very fresh and tasted good. I really enjoyed the chicken quesadilla with some of their medium red salsa. The medium red salsa deserves an award or something - it has just the right zing and is soooo tasty. I smothered everything in that salsa after this realization (what can I say, I'm a hillbilly at heart and grew up tossin' gravy on food).  Anyway ... the small burrito was more than just rice 'n beans - they added lettuce, sour cream, and maybe some other goodies - add the medium salsa, and yum-o! A very filling lunch.\n\nThe shop itself seems very clean - almost too clean for a mom & pop type place. It has a nice collection of photos on the walls, including one of Julio Iglesias (with autograph, I assume - didn't get too close to it). They do a good job of cleaning up tables once folks finish and leave.\n\nThe food was prepared quickly, as one would expect - so this is definitely a good spot to grab a quick bite of fresh, tasty mexican food.\n\nI'd give it 5 stars, but $9.17 felt about $1above what I should've been charged for the food.  Whatever - it is still a nice spot to eat when in the area.", "author": "Jamie W."}

He took the tortilla, shook it off and started again. My order may seem anal, but I'm not an anal person because I understand you shouldn't waste food. My order came out to be 5.95, not worth it for the type of burrito. At least Gordos gives you a hearty potion for their regular sizes.

The burritos were a little lumpy for my liking but I really like how they added broccolli and peppers to a Veggie Burrito which at most places is just a regular burrito without meat. It was nice to see they added something different that tastes great. \nAlthough I do recommend this place simply because it is probably the one and only good place to eat quick Mexican fast food on Geary Blvd- DO NOT TRY THE HOT RED SALSA- it tastes like tar. The Green Salsa is alot and if you didn't order a spicy burrito and don't like bland tasting food be prepared to add alot of it.\nOverall, for a quick bite it was good.

FYI, the inner Richmond doesn't have much to offer in the way of Mexican. If you're not heading all the way out to Tommy's or Tia Margaritas, then you might as well just go get some Thai food or something. But I'd never been to Pancho's and I thought I should give it a shot and it was most conveniently located to the bar in which I was due to meet the BF for a beer. \n\nAnyway, I got the Borracho, the one with the BBQ sauce on it, because you could put BBQ sauce on almost anything and it will be pretty good. Plus I liked the name. Let's just say, the burrito was satisfying. It hit the burrito spot. But was it a truly fine and estimable burrito? Not really. It was adequate. And if the craving struck again and Pancho's was the only place around, well, sure, I'd go back. \n\nBut maybe I'm jaded. 15 years as an SF resident will put your burrito standards at all-time unattainable sky high. I remember when Puerto Allegre had the best burritos around. El Farlito is still up there, but not what it once was. Same with La Cumbre. I am constantly nostalgic for Chabela's, though I do know they did decline in quality in the years before they burned down. Balazo is very shiny, but the burritos are hit and miss at best. \n\nAnyway, I'm haven't had one of those perfect burritos, the hot and gooey ones with the sturdy yet supple tortilla and the perfect proportions of filling and the right amount of cheese and the correct level of spiciness in forever.

But I was sooo excited to try the chicken soup, but it was horribly disappointing and utterly flavorless. And colorless. And overall blah blah blah. Nothing Baja, or even remotely Mexican about it. It was just undercooked veggies, boring boiled chicken, and blech rice in watery nothing broth. Hardly even soup! The nachos were decent and entirely edible, if nothing special, so at least that will always be an option. The burrito was passable, but COME ON. This is San Francisco.

The chips are spectacular, thusly the nachos are as well (and come in a huge portion to boot), the pico de gallo is excellent, baja fish tacos aren't bad. I was unimpressed by the atomic burrito. It's a bit pricey for the quality of Mexican food, but where else are you going to go to kill a taco craving in the Richmond?", "author": "Preston G."}

I don't know how they manage to make Mexican food so unappealing but every time I go it reminds me of why I waited however long to return.", "author": "Daniel S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-24", "description": "The decor of the place is perfect: Salsa bar, to-go counter, all Mexican staff with a burrito making station, Mexican horns blaring through fuzzy speakers.  Now to the food:  Absolutely $&\"#% disgusting.  I ordered a simple fast-food Mexi staple: carne asada burrito with rice, beans, sour cream and salsa.  The meat was in long stringy chunks as if it had been chewed before, the rice and beans were tasteless and it was topped off with a huge golf ball of sour cream.  Salsa is the best way to judge the quality of a Mexi burrito shop and their salsa was spot on:  Absolute crap.  Stinging red salsa as if mixed with turpentine, tasteless salsa verde and a strange light brown salsa with enough flavor to mask the soul-less burrito.  This is my first post, Is there any way to get enough negative ratings and get a place shut down?  If there's a yelp petition app for the iphone, sign me up.  Little chihuahua is much better as well as any burrito shop in San Diego.   Shame on you Pancho.", "author": "Stephen L."}

I ate the tacos there and it's just \"eh\"..... OK.... meat had good flavor but not the beans and rice... sorta bland.... sorry for those who really like it there, but i've had much better mexican food then this....", "author": "E S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-13", "description": "Given there is no Mexican eatery in the inner Richmond, Pancho's does okay in satisfying my once-in-a-while cravings for Mexican foods.  I usually order the veggie burrito ($6.95) which is pretty packed with veggies instead of mostly carbs.  Tortilla chips come along with the order.  These little treats are just to my liking, thin and crispy with a salsa bar made readily available to you for self service.  I usually pack on extra cilantro-onion salsa to accompany my veggie burrito.  Craving satisfied!", "author": "Nadine M."}

MUCH better and more traditional than Papalote which is down the street. the carnitas tacos here are the best i've had in the city so far! their taquitos dorados are so crunchy on the outside yet juicy and tender on the inside. and they pile on the guacamole!!! this place (unlike most mexican restaurants) does not skimp on the guacamole. their borracho burrito is sooo yummy! and for the burritos you can choose between a regular flour, wheat, or veggie tortilla! the white corn tortillas they use for the tacos are really soft and i believe they're handmade. and they recently extended their hours so now they're open later!", "author": "N.

Food is fresh and tasty.  Restaurant is clean and not full of schmuzig.  A good alternative if you don't want the noise of Chevy's on Van Ness.  Staff is polite but not more.  Tables are clean.  Food is tasty and made to order.  You can watch them make it which is a plus.", "author": "Brian K."}

Since gordos is their only other real competition out in this area let's compare the two....unlike gordos you don't watch them make your burrito, you simply order, and sit somewhere while your burrito is mysteriously assembled.  You get free chips and a salsa bar unlike gordos so I guess that's a plus but their burritos are smaller than gordos. Now onto the burrito...to say the best it was meh...too dry and I found it lacking any flavor, sorry pancho's I really wanted to like it but at least it did a good job of soaking up the alcohol. As for the price I'd say the value is better than gordos since you get free chips and salsa but for the same price I can get a wayyy better burrito in the mission but like I've mentioned before when your in the inner richmond how many other options do you really have ?", "author": "Mike A."}
