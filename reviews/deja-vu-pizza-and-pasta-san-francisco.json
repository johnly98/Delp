Its not pre-cooked and then reheated.  The price is very good for SF and the choices are endless.  I have just eaten the cheese pizza (I am cheap - its only $4.95 for a double slice).  Its not really NY style although it is normal, thin crust.  I would say it tastes like a better version of a Costco pizza with higher quality ingredients and not so bready.  It's close to NY.  The crust/dough is quite good and like I said fresh - better than re-heated, somewhat overcooked like some of the known slice places.  I never understand why those places fully cook the pizza since they are going to reheat it when someone orders.\n\nIt seems they may have problems with delivery - so perhaps you just need to be careful.  The couple is originally from Burma and have been in the US for 10 years.  Their customer service can be curt at times - but that is just their culture and probably still not being adroit at dealing with different type of americans.  Hours are good.

I'd heard that Deja Vu is great for slice spot as each slice is made to order and one slice should have no problem filling you up for lunch. I called ahead and by the time I got there (10 minutes) my order was ready to go. I handed over my credit card and signed away $5.11 after taxes. The lady behind the counter handed over a paper plate inside of a brown bag that had some weight to it.\n\nOnce I got back to the office, it was clear I got the odd slice (see pic), it had crust on 3 sides and it wasn't the best impression of a possible new lunch spot. It was almost as if the pizza was a left over Sicilian slice and someone had bitten off a piece. Luckily I love crust, so I wasn't terribly offended and I will admit the pizza had some good flavor but for the most part it felt pretty average across the board. \n\nWill I return? I probably will. My co-workers order often and split pies, so I hope to give it another try and perhaps get treated to a real slice.

It's clear it's under new management.  Judging by the cut pattern, I suggest they get someone with pizza making experience to train the pizza makers.  \n\nI ordered a large vegetarian supreme the other night, and it looked as if it had been topped from four feet away.  Perhaps they were playing, \"Pizza Ring Toss\" or trying to make two or more pizzas at the same time.  Some of veggies were somewhat evenly distributed, others less so.  The tomatoes heavily favored one side, and were cut too thickly.  The garlic was apparently flung on, splattering the pizza in large and small glops.  \n\nAn important point for ALL pizza joints:  Raw garlic needs to be placed on the pizza LAST, on top, so it can cook properly  and release its wonderful load of garlic flavor.  By putting it on the sauce first it gets warm, but does not cook fully, which defeats the point of the garlic.  We did not smell garlic when we opened the box and stuck our face in it, and we should have.\n\nBut we were able to redistribute the toppings, more or less, and it was tasty.

D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu's dough tastes like something you would want to eat, like fresh from the oven breadsticks, and not something you want to leave on your plate.  (You know how a lot of people leave the crust behind?  I've never been that kind of an eater - I'm definitely a founding member of the clean plate club - but I can't blame folks when it comes to most pizza slices in SF.  A lot of them have lousy dough that results in a crappy crust not worth eating.)\n\nGood dough should have a certain chewiness, an inherent elasticity that comes from the gluten in the flour.  If your pizza crust is \"powdery\" and flavorless, it's just not the way it should be.  Arinell's makes dough like this - no \"toothiness\", no flavor, it's flat and lifeless.  MELTED CHEESE can cover a multitude of sins, but if your dough can't stand up on its own, you're eating sub-par pizza.  But, if you start with good dough, if your foundation has got its own flavor, you're way ahead of the pack, and D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu has definitely mastered the art of the dough. \n\nMy absolute favorite topping here is their SAUSAGE.  It's hard to put it into words, which is unfortunate given that I'm supposed to be a writer, but, I'll try.  Not only does their sausage have great flavor and spiciness, but it's got the perfect texture.  Don't get me wrong, I like pepperoni, but if I have a choice between circular sliced meat or meat that is crumbled and hasn't been put into a sausage casing, I'll take the ground meat variety every time.  I'd rather eat morsels of meat than slices of meat, and if you feel the same way, I would STRONGLY recommend your ordering the sausage at D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu.  \n\nWhat they define as a \"slice\" is more like 1.5 slices at a normal pizza parlor.  (Pizza parlor, right?  Who the hell says THAT anymore?  Man, you know I'm old skool.)  So, while $4.61 sounds like a lot for a slice with one topping, if you figure it's really like a slice and a half, suddenly, it's not so bad.\n\nThe other thing you need to know about them, especially if you are in a hurry - like on your lunch break - is that they make your slice to order.  I mean they LITERALLY create your slice from scratch, from the raw, stretchy dough.  Each SLICE (not pie, but SLICE) starts out as dough and is stretched and topped with sauce, cheese, and whatever you asked for as a topping AFTER YOU ORDER IT.  Which is COOL if you're down with freshness and customization, but is sort of uncool if you're on a tight schedule.  I mean, for me, pizza is typically one of those \"I see it behind the glass display case, I want THAT slice right there, they heat it up and I'm eating it within 3 minutes\" kind of deals.  But that is NOT how it works at D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu and you should know that going in.  Your personalized slice, made from scratch when you order it, is going to take 10-12 minutes to be made, and it's going to be MOTHERFUCKING HOT when it comes out of the oven.  \n\nWhat is the solution?  PHONE AHEAD.  Yes, as crazy as it might seem (to anyone from NYC, Northern New Jersey or Connecticut) you can literally call them up and say, \"I want to order a SLICE with sausage, and I'll come by and pick it up in 15 minutes.\"  That is really the best way to do it here.  That way, your slice has a chance to \"settle\" in a little bit before you bite into it.  It's still fresh from the oven, but it's not burn the roof of your mouth fresh from the oven, you know what I mean?  \n\nIn summary: D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu is not a spontaneous kind of thing.  It requires a little bit of planning, like, \"We're on the Bay Bridge, we'll be driving past their shop in 15 minutes, let's call ahead and order two slices to pick up, whaddya say, honey?\"  But it's worth the effort.

The manager tells me that my delivery left over 10 minutes ago and my food should arrive at any second. No problem, only 15 minutes late. At 8:45PM, still no food. I call the restaurant again, and am told yet again, \"Any minute now.\"\n\nAt 8:55PM, I call the restaurant for the final time- and tell them that at this point, they should cancel my order. The food had been ordered over two hours prior and was \"on it's way\" for over 45 minutes- which means it was sitting unheated, unrefrigerated in some teenagers car for close to an hour and was reaching unsanitary conditions. To this final complaint the manager responds that he \"didn't actually call the driver the other times and didn't know the food hadn't left the restaurant yet so it was still sanitary.\" When I asked for a refund you could almost hear the shrug on the phone as he responded \"you already paid for it.\"\n\nWay to go buddy, your lack of service constituted a Yelp review.", "author": "Jasmine r."}

As my housemate grabbed the box, the driver placed the soda on top and the weight flipped the box over and onto the ground. The pizza was a dirty sloppy mess afterward but it had been paid for so the driver told us to call the restaurant and explain what happened so we could get a replacement. They basically told us we'd have to buy another pizza if we wanted a pizza! No apology, no offer of a discount or coupon, nothing. They even made us feel bad for expecting some type of consolation by informing us that the new pizza would come out of the delivery driver's pay if we didn't pay for it.\n\nSo my housemate paid for another pizza. What? We were hungry!

We placed an order for our food; I ordered a pizza slice and a pasta to go. My coworker had ordered a green salad to have before her pasta. We sat there for 30mins after placing our order and we were ignored. Nothing was coming our way. The only food that came on time were our drinks and that's because you get them out of the fridge yourself. My coworker asked where her salad was and the lady said, very soon, as she then started to make it. There was one man in the bake making pizza and one woman in the front taking orders and cooking apparently. No one else was in the restaurant. 5 mins later my coworker asked if that was my pizza sitting back there, and it was. So I ate my pizza slice while my coworker had her salad which basically only consisted of iceberg lettuce. I had the Pesto Delight which was really yummy. We proceeded to wait there an additional 15mins without our pastas.During these past 15mins, a woman walks in and starts having a friendly conversation with the woman working upfront. My coworker then asked for our pastas to be put in to go containers since we had been waiting there for so long. The woman said, ok sure and then barely STARTED to cook the pasta. It was ridiculous! We asked her, \"so you haven't even began cooking it?\" And the lady just smiled. At this point I don't even know how much time had passed because we were so aggravated. I'm assuming it was about 15 mins later she told us to come get it from the counter. Only to find out she had cooked me the wrong pasta. I'm a Pescatarian which I had informed her of when I placed the order. She then asks me, \"you don't like chicken?\" And I had to explain to her yet again that I had ordered prawns. I asked for a refund because I was already late going back to work. She refused and said she'll just cook me another one. I was so irritated. Why won't you give me my money back? I had to wait there until she was done. I will say she cooked it pretty fast. But now I'm just irritated for paying for over priced food and poor customer service. She could have at least offered a free soda or something but she herself seemed annoyed.

I found just what I was looking for at Deja Vu.\n\nFirst of all, the \"slices\" are HUGE. They come sliced down the middle, so they're really two slices a piece, and you still need a fork and a knife. I can eat a lot and I never have leftovers, but the two slices I ordered at Deja Vu were a challenge - which I won. One slice is probably enough for a normal person, split three among two of you if you're gluttons like me.\n\nI ordered a slice of cheese and a slice of the restaurant's namesake, Deja Vu. The cheese slice was the same style as other down and dirty pizza by the slice joints, but better than most. Also on the greasier side, but not too bad. The Deja Vu slice was much more interesting. It contained spinach, feta, and pesto. They were all high quality ingredients and they worked together nicely.\n\nThis would definitely be an excellent place to come late at night when you've got the munchies, but you don't need to be drunk to come here.", "author": "Adam B."}

No way is Round Table or any of the crappy mainstream ones better! Tastes better than the first time I ordered too which wasn't bad also. Also I really trust their health score on here which is decent compared to other spots. Yes I always check the healthscore here and look for several things(1.If they wash their hands properly AND 2. If they have don't have a rodent/bug problem..If a place breaks either of those rules I stay away...)..So far they've been cool with that. Pizza tonight is tasting great and believe me I am super picky when it comes to pizza spots.... Crust and sauce is hitting my taste pallets in an excellent way atm, good consistency. A little greasy but I don't mind the grease cos it makes me think of how pizzas were made in the 80's! Sauce? Prolly not the greatest pizza sauce I've ever tasted(that award goes to the old Shakey's Pizza in Daly City for best pizza sauce)but it's decent.\n\nI am now a fan and i will order again.

It's not as disappointing as some of those touristy joints in Union Square, but it's not a place to go out of your way for.  Also, it's weird that they cut their slices into two pieces instead of giving you one large slice.\n\nCheese: Standard.  Could have had a crisper bottom, but wasn't so limp that it went vertical.\n\nClam Bake: Always appreciate when a place tries to make clam pizza.  The onions were a little unnecessary, adding a texture and flavor that clashes with the clams and garlic.\n\nValencia: The eggplant was in that weird state where it wasn't raw, but not cooked to the point of Mediterranean roasted yummyness.  Usually not a fan of veggie focused slices so this reinforced that sentiment.\n\nPorto: Only got this because of the lingui\u00e7a, a Portuguese alternative that is way better than pepperoni.

And the Cajun Fettucine (I got extra prawns) -- I like spicy food, but this was like someone poured red hot pepper flakes, Old Bay Seasoning, and black pepper into fettucini alfredo and called it \"Cajun.\" The shrimp were disgusting. I have never, since moving to San Francisco 4 years ago, had worse seafood---small, gummy (like semi-hardened Play-Doh or clay or something), dry, chewy, and overly fishy-tasting. I started remembering articles I've read about cheap shrimp being grown in \"farms\" where they're all crowded together and with no place to swim and the water is filthy with waste. That's the genre of shrimp that flashed before my eyes. I was starving, so had to eat some of it, but stopped after about 8 bites---my face was on fire from the cheap weird seasonings, I felt queasy, my stomach was muttering like a dude in an alleyway, and a big pile of \"shrimp\" had to be tossed out.", "author": "Swiss C."}

I was sort of scared at first, and thought \"What the hell am I doing ordering a greasy, meaty pizza\" but I did anyway in order to satisfy their $15 order requirement for free delivery.\n\nThe delivery came within the hour, and what I really wanted was my caesar salad, which I devoured in 5 minutes, even though the salad didnt seem chilled, it was almost warm actually, and they didnt even bring any complimentary plates, napkins, utensils, parmesan cheese or crushed red pepper flakes. I didn't know that I had to ask for these things considering I ordered a LARGE freakin pizza for myself and had it delivered to a BUSINESS...\n\nAnyhow, the pizza on the other hand was a different story. I was full but finished my slice. It was the perfect ratio of sauce, dough, and fully-loaded with meat. I'm not usually a sausage, beef, salami or grease type-of-girl but I swallowed my whole pizza in 30 seconds and cant really tell you about the grease, sausage, beef or salami. It must've been subtle enough for a pregnant woman to not notice it. \n\nBottom line, I would definitely come back for the Meat Lovers pizza again because it's not too overly seasoned or too overpowering like some italian meats (I hate the taste of salami but didnt really taste it in this one)... The caesar salad is mediocre at best, I'd probably skip it next time, but the delivery was pretty fast.

Both times, it took at least another 45 minutes for my food to arrive, and all I ordered was a single pasta. The first time, when I complained again upon my food arriving, they finally admitted that they had lost the original order, and offered me a 10% discount (seriously?) on an order that took over 2 hours to arrive.

When it finally arrived, it was obvious that they had lied and probably misplaced the order again, judging by the piping hot temperature of the food.\n\nMoral of the story is, if you make a mistake, just admit it and don't string people along.

Now on to one of my favorites.\n\nSo... how does one choose where to order from?  If you're from the old-school, you open the yellow pages and look for who's closest, or who has the biggest ad... if you're from the new school, you look online, starting from a google search, followed by Yelp reviews of your results.\n\nIf you're a cheap bastard like me, you go in the kitchen and rummage through the drawer that houses plenty of ketchup packets, unused napkins and myriad menus that get left on your doorstep on a daily basis.  You then flip through them looking at coupons that best suit the situation at hand... flying solo? A pie for two or three people?  Mega huge deal with wings and all?  What is it you need to be delivered?  \n\nFrom there, you balance prices with options, much like ordering a new laptop (actually, the box is the same shape, pricing depends on options, and you use your lap for a table... hmmmm... maybe that wasn't such a stretch of a comparison)\n\nAfter trying this method several times, I have skipped the first and second step and just ordered from Deja Vu the last few times.  Why you ask?  Well... you're reading this, so I guess you're interested in what they have to offer.....\n\nFirst off, I've never had a cold, burnt or undercooked pie show up at the door.  Always cooked to perfection and gooey hot. Even though they deliver to the Western Addition from the Mission. MMmmMmMm.... pizza.\n\nDelivery times can vary.  I waited over an hour once, and have never had them show up within a half hour.  THis is good.  It means that they're hand making my pizza.  I'd rather wait a little while (or plan ahead and order earlier) than get factory made pie (Dominos?... fast because it's frozen)\n\nThe toppings are always fresh and yummy, although I have been in a groove with my favorite combo (Sausage, pineapple and jalapeo on half and  pepperoni or plain cheese for the other half)  However, when I've gotten peppers or anything else, it's fresh.  Plus, I hear they have broccoli.\n\nThe drivers can find my house.  I live on an obvious street, between two common cross streets, but drivers can't seem to find it.  Cabs, pizza... whatever... I always get a call from the corner asking where I am.  Not from the Deja Vu driver.... he rings the bell, and I have hot pizza.\n\nBut it all really comes down to crust and quality toppings.  In my book, they are only second to Escape From NY in terms of delicious thin crust.  \n\nAnyway... remember to give the driver a little extra time to get there, and you'll be happy with your pizza experience.  At this point, there are only Deja Vu and Escape From NY menus in the aforementioned drawer (and some Chinese menus, but the past two times I've ordered Chinese, either my son, or both of us get sick, so I don't look at those any more)", "author": "Shawn S."}

I have them programmed into my cell phone and I always get their vegetarian pizza.  Not because I'm a vegetarian/vegan (although I'm considering making the transition), but because it's yummy.  The guys who work there are really nice too, and aren't all sleazy and/or lethargic like some pizza parlor guys can be.  Not to mention that ordering \"one slice\" of pizza from them is really ordering two slices (one slice being regular-sized, and one being a little smaller than regular-sized.  Lotsa bang for your buck!).\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, I must urgently caution anyone contemplating ordering a calzone from Deja Vu, especially if you order one with a ton of mozarella cheese in it.  Most of their calzones have that ricotta-type cheese in it, and that's fine (mmmm, ricotta...), but one day I ordered some way cheesy-mozaralla/ricotta cheese calzone and I CHOKED on the mozarella cheese for maybe 10 seconds.  It felt like forever!  My BF (the same BF from my \"MacCallum House\" review) didn't even know I was choking because it was that silent type of choking - I seriously could not breathe!  All my useless BF could do was stare at me with a dumbstruck look on his face, so I finally managed to pull the cheese that was lodged in my throat out with MY HAND.  Gross? Sure. Scary? Oh fuck yeah!  \r\n\r\nI know I was probably a little too eager and shouldn't have tried to shovel hunks of calzone down my esophagus, but nevermind that.  I nearly DIED.\r\n\r\nStick with their veggie slices.", "author": "Karen F."}

They don't.  \n\nWhile I appreciated getting a piping hot piece in under 20 minutes, the guy behind me in line did not.

We played pizza delivery roulette for a while unsuccessfully before finding it, and our good faith in having decent pizza delivery has been restored ever since.  Here's what you need to know for maximum results:\n\n- Be aware if the pizza you choose lists garlic as one of its ingredients.  If you're not used to having garlic poured like salt over your food, then opt out.  \n\n- The crust is a little bit doughy, get thin if you're not into it.  \n\n- If you're feeling guilty and want to get some veg in you, the salads really aren't too bad, much more than the expected 3 pieces of lettuce, a tomato, and some dressing.   They actually have more than one kind of salad with a little more than your average trimmings.   It's actually amazing that one can even get any sort of vegetable arrangement delivered this late at night.  \n\nI'm also constantly impressed by how fast they are most of the time.

Its all about doing what your doing well, not about conforming to a specific standard. So with that in mind i am giving Deja Vu's pizza 3 stars. The stars are for nicely flavored sauce and bread, and for fresh well proportioned toppings. The two stars less are for taking so long to deliver an almost cold pizza (i can wait quite a while for a piping hot fresh pizza) and for tough hard to chew dough (like it had been over kneaded). The dough was tough enough to make it unpleasant and reheating it made it inedible. \nI do think if these two things were remedied i would order from them again. \nMedium thin crust. enough sauce to notice, i would say proportionate, if you like it saucy, maybe ask for more.", "author": "claire l."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-05", "description": "I've wavered between Chicago-style and east coast pizza for most of my life now, but I've finally found the answer.\n\nA thin, crispy crust is the only way to go. Toppings and cheese should not overpower the crust; if it takes a knife and fork to reasonably eat, it is not pizza. You should not fear cheese-blindness from one slice of pizza. It should be difficult to kill yourself choking on cheese with pizza, though one reviewer above clearly tried very hard.\n\nDeja Vu makes the best crispy-crusted (and therefore best over-all) pizza I've ever had. Their \"slices\" are the size of about two slices at other pizzerias such as Cable Car. As mentioned, every slice is freshly made so you don't have to get the one slice of vegeterian pizza that's been sitting out all day - I thought this was San Francisco, how is it that most pizzerias have one readily available vegeterian pizza? Anyway, each slice is encrusted all around in ... crust.\n\nThere are specials listed on the board, but I would steer clear of most of them. The Pesto Delight, a slice with pesto, feta, broccoli, and sun-dried tomatoes, is good, but overly busy. The Californian is a heap of 4 different cheeses for those that enjoy risking their lives whilst eating pizza. The real problem with the specials is that they have too many ingredients. Limiting the toppings to two ensures that the crust remains perfectly crispy and the slice is never soggy. This also limits the price to $3.95, cheaper than any burrito in the mission but just as filling.\n\nThe ideal order consists of a two-topping slice and a vanilla soda, totalling in the sub-$6 range.

And I have to say that it is in my top couple pizza places of all time.  However, this place does have somewhat of a learning curve. So learn from me (and some of the other reviewers) when I say that the fewer toppings the better. One topping is perfect. Two toppings is good. Three toppings and I'd send it back. Why is this? Well, I'm not entirely sure, but it has something to do with too many flavors at once and a reduction in the crispiness of the crust. Which takes me to my main point:\n\nThe crust is delicious. I highly recommend getting your pizza by the slice and not the pie because you get more crust and a sizable piece of pizza at that (at least two slices by most other pizza joint's standards). Also, everything is made right there on the spot just for your order! While this may make you wait around 10 minutes, it is worth it. In fact, I've got their number in my phone so I can call ahead and have it ready by the time I get there. \n\nIf you haven't eaten here, do yourself a favor and try it.

WAIT, ten minutes i just want a slice of pizza. thats when i see the guy behind her pull out a large slice of pizza out of the oven and hand it to the person behind it... It was huge i mean two slices worth easy. i desided it would be worth the wait.\n\nI go out side smoke a cig. and read a little i hear them call to me that my pizza is up i take one look at the wonderfull slice of joy in front of me and i go sit down and look at it with a small blend of greed and boyhood longing (sorry a bit creppy i know) The slice is cut in two and is massive, i wait for a bit for it to cool down and then take my first bite, it is amazing simply wonderful experance semispicy the cheese perfect the crust nice and thing all mixing together to for a tastfull experance of pure enjoyment.

Stereotypically, we ordered the San Franciscan, substituted the green peppers for black olives.  I was so happy when the pizza came out and was not dripping with grease.  Instead, each bite was filled with sausage, pepperoni, gooey cheese, mushrooms, and olives.  Who doesn't love that?  They are not skimpy on the toppings at all, and we were full after 2 slices each (2 people).  We had 2 slices left over, and I was glad when my friend told me to take them home.  I ate one slice for dinner and hubby polished off the second leftover piece.

What I do know is this was the first pizza I tried in the city, and I've been back multiple times. I would recommend slices over a whole pie, which they make to order. Particularly yummy is the sausage with roasted red peppers. One slice is really more like 2 and can completely fill you up. Fresh, tasty, friendly people, decent cost.

You will not feel \"funny\" like I always do about 1/2 hour after eating a 'yummy' neapolitan slice at Arinell.  They make every slice to order so it's huge and fresh but not slices from a pie if that's a requirement.

Then I realized you get just about the biggest slice known to man for that price and it all comes together.  That, the fact that it is by a bunch of bars, the fact the pizza is pretty freaking good, and they deliver all the way out to at least the inner richmond make me like this spot.  I would highly recommend it to anyone with a craving for pizza while in the Mission.", "author": "Timothy O."}

The calzones are enormous, stuffed with all kinds of good things, and have am amazing olive oil/oregano/thyme combination on the top; the hot calzones are pillow-like, savory, and usually perfect in every way. \n\n   My only complaint is that last week, I was ravenous, and ordered 2 calzones to be delivered. One was without ricotta but with sausage, and the other was with ricotta and peppers.  When they were delivered 45 minutes later (usually worth the wait), they were switched. I don't eat pork, and my girlfriend doesn't not eat pork, so we called, and they said that they would fix them. We left the wrong calzones in boxes in case they wanted them back for whatever reason, and when the delivery person came back another 45 minutes later, he only had one calzone (sausage no ricotta).   He said he'd go back and \"look around\" (for the other calzone? laying around? perhaps under an SF weekly on the counter?), and after 10 minutes, we called and asked for our money back. We'd have to go in to get money back in person. So, I ate a cold calzone with no ricotta.  I know there are much worse things in this world, and typing this all feels rather silly at this point, but I felt pretty burned up that someone I order from almost weekly would not fix their own mistake.  And I said, \"I'm going to Yelp that s***\" so here I am. \n\nI am still dreaming of the ricotta in those calzones!", "author": "Ivy S."}

If anyone can explain how it's possible for them to be so different, let me know.  The slices are big and sliced in half, so you can decide just how much to eat.  Made to order, so always fresh - and worth the wait.  The sauce is great, and the crust is nice and doughy (my friend prefers crunchier crust, so he asks for them well done, and they always oblige).  A bit on the salty side, I never get them within a couple of hours of bedtime or my blood's rushing too much to fall asleep.", "author": "David G."}

We turned to yelp and randomly found this place. Ordered one small cheese pizza and an extra large that one with Canadian bacon and cheese and onions, with added chicken. All Chicago style deep dish. Also a cesar salad and garlic bread and diet soda. This came out to $50 something but there were 3 of us so $20 each is good. delivery was fast (mission to castro) and when it arrived, the can of soda was a 2 ltr (still in our fridge half a week later) and the extra large pizza was GIANT! And the pizza was the most filling pizza ever. Just a mound of cheese and stuff. J could only have 2 pieces and I could only have one and a half. And we're big eaters. S managed a couple more, and the salad. But we had tons and tons leftover. Tons. The box wouldn't even fit in the fridge. The pieces were so big we had to eat them with a fork and knife... I was full the whole rest of the day, till it was time to eat our brownie sundaes... last nite I had one more slice that was leftover... I ate it cold and I actually liked it even better. still really filling, (even the crust was filled with cheese and pesto), but easier to eat, and really tasty. So go here, but if you order an extra large, know you have meals for the next week. The only bad thing id say is could have used more of the meat on that... it was hard to find the veggies and meat with all that cheese. But good.", "author": "Merredith L."}

The only reason I add NJ is most of the gifted pizzasmiths of the big apple ultimately retire to NJ and end up opening pizzerias. California does not understand pizza and it never will. CA is kind of like Wayne Campbell's ex-girlfriend,  just can't admit it's over and move on. Sad really. I have now been living in SF for 14 months and have tried just about every sad excuse for pizza. Deja Vu Pizza on 16th street is the only joint in town that even compares to the east coast other than Arinells. The key is to ask for your pie or slice extra thin. They will prepare it papery thin and greasy just like the wops of lower Manhattan have been doing it for decades. The ingredients are fresh too.Thanks Deja Vu for making me feel at home for a few minutes.", "author": "Jason W."}

We go back down, still not there, I call him again but this time I literally spell out every single number and letter in my address.  Oops!  He's totally in the wrong place, he says he will be at my place in a couple minutes.  5 minutes later i get a call from someone at Deja Vu asking me where I live, I tell him and he tells the delivery guy that I live on Page, and I'm like H-A-Y-E-S (I said it and spelled it), and he says Haight?
