She ordered a Bombay gin martini with extra vermouth and I got my usual \"slightly dirty\" vodka martini.\n\nHer martini was really off. She didn't like it and I took a taste and it was not Bombay gin and vermouth. She told the server and ordered a wine instead.\n\nBoth of our dinner salads were great and the server was attentive.\n\nAs I was about halfway through my martini, I nearly slit my lip open on what turned out to be a gouged out rim that I hadn't noticed when she brought the drink. I pointed it out to her. There was no apology or offer of a replacement drink, or even an unbroken glass.\n\nWhen the bill was brought, it included both my friend's martini and her wine and my martini as well.\n\nWe had to say something to her and she went back to her manager and then took the two martinis off the bill.\n\n1) I believe the manager should have come over to our table and 2) we should not have had to speak to the server.\n\nI can't really blame her if she hadn't received proper training from the management on how to handle customers who encounter a problems with their meals.", "author": "Stephen S."}

Though the food wasn't the best I've ever had, all other qualities made up for it. \n\nI had made reservations for 6pm on Thursday but there was a good amount of tables available. We were sat right away and shortly greeted by out waiter. He was a friendly gentleman who wore glasses. We started off with a Calamari Appetizer which was REALLY good. For dinner I ordered the Paella which was a little lacking in flavor but I like how there was a bunch of clams that came with it. Lovers of this will probably appreciate the dish more. \n\nWhat I really liked is being sat near the piano though. In my reservation, I specifically asked for this because I feel it just set the mood for the event to come. That and I just love pianos! At one point our waiter took a minute from serving and started singing with the pianist. It was awesome!! Truly a treat. I really felt at home that night!!\n\nAll in all, Max's Opera Cafe continues to be a tradition of me and my girls when we go to SF Symphony. I'm already in a classic mood. I already gotta dress in a classy fashion. I might as well have a classy dinner, right?

That isn't even that late, but you pretty much know what you're getting here no matter what you order. Before last year, it was unwisely the lure of gargantuan desserts like the New York Cheesecake or the Ultimate Chocolate Cake. Immediate gratification followed by years of regret. That sounds like the story of my life, but it could actually be Max's slogan if there was truth in advertising.\n\nAnyway, we were coming out of the surreal disappointment that was \"A Wrinkle in Time\" at the AMC Van Ness and feeling a bit peckish. The place was emptying out at around 9PM on a Tuesday evening. No one was at the piano playing Sondheim, and consequently none of the waitstaff was warbling the intricately sophisticated lyrics. What has remained consistent over the years are the loud patrons at the bar, this time a legion of drunk Aussie tourists. At least we were able to snag a booth where we perused the dinner meal. Yep, no desserts for us. We wised up finally and shared the $8.99 Chopped Vegetable Salad.\n\nIt was a bite-size combination of broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, cherry tomatoes, romaine lettuce, spinach, and toasted croutons in a small mound with a balsamic vinaigrette on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/2ptaNFx). Artless but it hit the spot. For a chaser, we each ordered a $9 cup of Max's Famous Chicken Matzo Ball Soup, which is justly famous even though my first choice was the less caloric Russian Cabbage Soup. It was a hearty broth with carrot, celery, and generic egg noodles, dominated by one big matzo ball which readily picked up the flavor of the chicken stock (photo: http://bit.ly/2ppQxFM). So Jamie and I can survive in a post-dessert universe when patronizing Max's.

It was a madhouse when we arrived on Saturday night (I highly recommend a reservation; we didn't have one), but we were only 2, so we did get a table right away, though by the time we left there was a huge line of people waiting for tables.  \n\nI have incredible admiration for the waiters, who have to weave their way through masses of people, and go up and downstairs while carrying trays.  They do it, and are still efficient.\n\nI love crab cakes and ordered their crab cake dinner, which came with cabbage, which looked limp and unappetizing, but was actually fabulous, with bacon, onions, and huge chunks of mushrooms. Almost better than the crab cakes.\n\nBut the crab cakes were wonderful, about  2\" thick, full of crab (and no overpowering Old Bay, which I hate).  I don't usually use any sauce, but the remoulade was so good, I ate the cakes with that as well.\n\nMy husband had fetuccini with huge mushrooms stuffed with spinach and cheese and said it was delicious.\n\nIn previous visits, I have had hamburgers (one of their specialties, I think), and also lamb chops, which were not on the menu last night.\n\nI really love this place.  This night was my 75th birthday and as soon as I sat down, the pianist played happy birthday -- of course it was for someone ELSE, but I pretended it was for me.\n\nThe only reason Igive it 4 out of 5 stars was because ofthe level of noise, which was ear-splitting (and I'm partially deaf!)", "author": "Beverly S."}

Only one of those things remains.\n\nThe hostess who greeted my girlfriend and I was not particularly warm, but we rolled with it. Our server was soft-spoken and pretty confused about a request for a spicy margarita, offering to make it spicy by putting in Absolute Pepper (or Peppar?), which is vodka, not tequila, and surely would've been awful. He offered to check with the bartender about how they could spice up a margarita without asking what our second choice would be if they couldn't come up with something, which was the end result.\n\nFood was okay. Far from great, but nothing off-putting. The portions are still huge, which warmed my heart.\n\nWhat's still bothering me today is what happened when we requested to-go boxes, which just about everyone at Max's does. A busser came by and set two plastic to-go boxes on the table with a plastic bag, and then just turned around and left! I was appalled. \n\nI worked in restaurants for 7 years, from diners to Michelin starred joints, and I never, EVER would've just set boxes on a table, expecting my guests to box the food themselves. \n\nMax's Opera Cafe, I'm certain, used to be a nice enough place where they would box the rest of your gigantically portioned meal for you. Otherwise, what the heck are we tipping on? You failed to execute a not-that-difficult cocktail request. Never once were we made to feel welcome or taken care of, and then I need to box my food up before I leave? Who's serving who? \n\nWhat's next, should I plate the food myself in the kitchen? Heck, maybe I should grab an apron and get to cookin' too. Unbelievable. Sadly, I'd be hesitant to go back.", "author": "Dan R."}

Anyways, the hostess told my husband she didn't call us even though it was clearly flashing. \n\nMy husband & I go back to the seating area, which BTW, are chairs lined up on a ramp so the seats are on a decline. Finally we were paged & led to our table. \n\nImmediately my husband & I noticed the table was sticky. It's probably not a good idea to paint the table tops. \n\nOur server took our order. We ordered the avocado fries for an appetizer. The server said OK. I told her I'll have the fish & chips; she said OK. My husband ordered the patty melt; the server said OK. Then, the server asked what it was I ordered. I glanced over & she was still writing down \"avocado fries.\" After she wrote all 3 dishes down, she went to the next table for their order & left our menus on our table. \n\nThe avocado fries arrived, very much lacking in presentation. The avocado fry itself was kind of bland. Avocado doesn't have much flavor; the least they could have done was season the batter. The sauce was glopped on a lettuce leaf making it difficult to scoop. There wasn't even enough sauce; we had to scrape down the lettuce leaf and still had bland avocado fries sans sauce. \n\nNot once were we offer drink refills but we were FINALLY offered some bread when we were halfway done with our meals. \n\nI think I'll stick to Burlingame.", "author": "Rose A."}

Interesting layout, as you enter next to \"take-out\" counter - just continue forward past \"salad prep area\" to host/ess stand to be seated. The service is always attentive, with many servers becoming familiar faces. The place can get noisy, but such are people today! Good for small groups as well, as we often see. The seating side closest to McAllister seems a little more relaxed, perhaps the setting calms people. Many good items on the menu, including salads, French dip, Matzoh Ball soup and my one and only love, the Ultimate Grill Cheese (no tomatoes, please - they get too soggy!) and sub a side chopped salad. Plenty for lunch. Hot rolls available on request as well, but they tend to favor the raisin rolls over sourdough, so if you prefer sourdough just ask for those instead of both. Anyways . . . if you're in the civic center area you should stop by and try this place. Gets busy around lunch because of the office bees, so if possible come at opening or after 1pm . . . gets quieter. One great piece of news!!! I have been to several Max's throughout the greater Bay Area for many decades, and they always had \"ice tea\" that was brought to your table while it was brewing! This and a large cup of ice, with a lemon wedge, is the way I was accustomed to receiving Max's ice tea. Sadly, somewhere in the past few years they switched to bring you the glass pre-filled with tea and ice, as do most places today. Most uncivilized for those of us who like a strong (long brewed) tea. However, this visit I almost fainted as the server brought us our ice teas - in a tea pot, with 2 large glasses of ice each (you really need the second glass as it is VERY hot and melts the first glass of ice quickly!). I was shocked, and mentioned this, to which the server replied that the new manager, a nephew (?) of the owners wanted a return to the old ways, and this was one face of the new and improved Max's. I approve strongly, and appreciate the extra effort. Maybe it does \"taste\" the same as the premixed teas, but I think if presentation is the key to a great meal, this is the way to start it off right!! Thanks for the happy memories - again!!", "author": "Mark K."}

My family and I came here to celebrate my brothers birthday and honestly the entire time I was there I was pissed off. We got to the restaurant around 720. We were seated right away (first star) while we waited our waiter came and took drink orders. The rest of my family joined us and we placed our food order. We ordered a good amount of food. Unfortunately, we sat until 845 when they brought us our food. My children (who are 5) had to sit and wait until the food was prepared to eat so they got irritable and wouldn't sit still. When the food finally came I couldn't believe what they put in front of me.  We ordered 3 things of nachos, the chips were stale, it was like they took some ingredients and just dropped them on top of the chips. The chicken they put on mine was cold, my boyfriend ordered steak nachos the steak was burnt and my cousin who order chicken with extra jalape\u00f1os. They gave her cold chicken, a little bit of jalape\u00f1os and to top it off. The amount of meat was very small for them to be $20 each! All of the other food was mediocre. My sons burger was undercooked, we asked for well done the burger came out medium. My daughter ordered a grilled cheese with fries which could've came out quickly. I wouldn't be so upset if I didn't know the restaurant was basically empty aside from 4 people in another part. I ended up speaking to the manager regarding my disappointment with the food. He didn't seem to care much that the kitchen was so slow children had to wait over a hour to be served their meal. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Especially if you have small children. Oh the second star is for the waiter being so polite and welcoming! I would never fault him for a mess up in the kitchen! One last thing. Did I mention they microwave the 3 plates of nachos???

We went in anyway and decided to let it all hang out being New Year eve! We were hopeful that we can get a good meal and be entertained by their talented servers, as after all, we haven't been into Max's for well over 15 years. But alas! I now remember why we stayed away. Their glory days seemed over as we ended up getting neither.\n \nThe evening started pleasantly enough with live piano playing in the background. The dining room was nicely decorated for the holiday season and appeared cozy and swanky. The Christmas lights stylishly lit up the bar area and the glass windows.  Even with a full house, the muted conversation and soft piano music added some class and sophistication to the ambiance. Being a fan of the opera, I was somewhat disappointed that none of the servers sing anymore. This used to be a unique draw for Max's during their heydays. \n\nThe server could have been a little more attentive but overall pleasant and friendly. Soups, salads, burgers, sandwiches, pastas, desserts etc. ...You name it; Max's have them all!  One can say Max's is like a glorified diner. We shared a hearty bowl of Russian Cabbage Soup ($8.00) sans beets. I assume this was the non-beets version of borscht. It was instead tomato-y and the other ingredients were cabbage with chock-full of beef giving the soup a savory, beefy flavor. With a subtle sweet and sour taste, the soup was great though not over-the-top great. (4 stars)\n\nIn the mood to play \"Finding a needle in a haystack\"? Try Max's Famous Crab Cakes ($17.00). Two good-sized crab cakes were served but where was the crabmeat? Bland! Bland! Bland! They looked like frozen patties with tartar sauce on top, which by the way was good but cannot save the underwhelming crab cakes. The saving grace for this dish was the red cabbage and jicama slaw that came with a mustard caper aioli. (2 stars). Skip!\n\nTri-Mushroom Fettuccine ($17.00) wasn't bad but needed help.  Even without any culinary background, I still know it was time to add Parmesan for better flavor; to spice the pasta with a little chili crushed peppers and to add a cautious touch of salt. I am not a huge fan of rosemary and thyme bunches and had to toss them. I wish Max's were more generous with the tri-mushrooms (portabella, shitake and button). The mushrooms were delicious though, and were saut\u00e9ed with fresh herbs, evoo and toasted garlic. The fettuccine was a toothsome morsel, had a good bite or al dente. (3 stars)\n\nWe thought we needed to order at least one sandwich since Max's is known for their deli meats. Since no one cared for a Reuben or Corned Beef, we settled on a Patty Melt ($15.00) that came highly recommended from a young friend who had no qualms with fat and cholesterol! I bit my tongue and reluctantly agreed.  Why not... today was NYE? We ordered the works and it came loaded with cheese, caramelized onions and 1000 Island on grilled rye. It was sinfully rich alright and sinfully tasty as well while you chomp into the cheese, the onions, the medium rare meat and only to sober up with the down-to-earth taste of rye. Yay! There was no guilt feeling at least today...it only starts the next day or the New Year! (4 stars)\n\nThe tart and aromatic Key Lime pie ($8.00) was just the way I remembered it from 15 years ago and provided a happy ending.... for the year 2014, I mean. The sweet and flaky crust was filled with a creamy smooth lime flavored filling and topped with a dollop of whipped cream. It was very refreshing to your palate. (4 stars)", "author": "Geoff G."}

The reservation people had overbooked are working for computer and paper lists and had a fully packed restaurant with no hope of accommodating most of the people in line.

The toasted bread was probably the best tasting thing from my plate, next to the French fries. The avocado wasn't ripe enough and was hard and had no flavor. The chicken breast in the sandwich was horrible and I'm pretty sure it was a frozen piece of meat. I took a few bites of the first half, with the thinner part of the breast, and my boyfriend asked how it was and I mentioned something was off. I bit into the thicker part of the chicken breast in the sandwich...and spit it out because it felt like I was biting into raw meat. It looked cooked through, but was was to tough to be fresh and turned me off from the rest of the sandwich, didn't even bother to pack up the other half.\n\nMy boyfriend had a corned beef and swiss...it was decent, your average corned beef sandwich...nothing spectacular though. \n\nOur son had the kids macaroni and cheese. It looked like macaroni and cheese, but tasted like macaroni and butter. I know butter is used to make Mac and cheese normally...but this was more butter flavor than I've tasted on anything...even buttered toast for breakfast.\n\nWe were seated fast, customer service was fine, but the food was nothing that would make me return.

Maestro's is long gone and I do miss their chicken crepes.  The choices of restaurants are limited.  O3 Bistro changed up their menu...nice ambiance but the luncheon menu selection ain't what it used to be.\n\nAfter 40+ years of working for the state government, it was time for me to start a second journey (heading out the door and toward retirement).  My colleagues gave me a farewell luncheon on September 24 at Max's Opera Cafe, and they were kind enough to do so.  I didn't have the heart to tell two of my colleagues (organizers of the luncheon) that I was not (and still not) a big fan of Max's.  The menu selections were okay; and all I could hope for was improvement in customer service.  \n\nLast year I attended a farewell luncheon, and the service was slow, especially for people who ordered the Asian chicken wrap.  Most of us had already eaten over half of our lunch when the waitstaff brought out the wrap.  They claimed they were not fully staffed that day.  Even my Arnie Palmer was sour.  \n\nThe customer service improved and the waitstaff was more attentive and accommodating.  My turkey sandwich was okay.  At least there was more gravy on the mashed potatoes.  My Arnie Palmer tasted better.  Overall rating:  no more and/or less than a 3.25.", "author": "Carol C."}

Our reservation was at 5:30 but it was already super busy. Most of my family had already been sat but I had to stand in a 5-10 minute line to speak with the hostess. She couldn't find our last name but said there was one large party in the back and motioned towards the right side of the restaurant. Thanks? \n\nOnce we were all sat, our server came by and took our drink order. She was unaware of half of the drinks that we ordered (which were all in the drink menu) and kept asking us to point to the drink name in the menu. The drinks came in two's throughout a 10-15 minute period; during that time we attempted to order food and she would quickly rush away before we could say anything. When it finally came time to order, she took our starter orders and then walked away, saying that she had to put in those orders before she could take down our entrees. Really?\n\nWe ordered the crab cakes and the friend calamari. Both dishes were pretty tasty. Once we were finished the dirty dishes sat on our table even after our entrees were delivered. Finally we asked another server to remove the dishes from our table. Our water glasses were not refilled once, and it was only until we were mostly done with our entrees that our server asked if we wanted any more drinks. For the entree, I ordered the bowl of matzo ball soup, expecting it to be a super large serving that the restaurant is known for. Sadly, it was not an entree sized dish, but I was able to take bites from everyone else's meal. My husband ordered the Rueben and greatly enjoyed it, although he said that potato salad tasted too much like vinegar. My brother ordered the fish and chips; he said the fish was good but the fries were way too soggy.  My parents ordered the grilled salmon and soba salad, and there were no complaints. \n\nHalfway through our entree we told our server that we needed to leave by a certain time in order to make our show, and asked for our bill in advanced. 5 minutes until we're supposed to leave, and we're still waiting for the bill. She seemed uninterested that we were in a rush, which greatly frustrated the entire table. We ended up having to run to the theater in order to make it in time. \n\nThe food was good enough to earn 2 stars, but otherwise a definite 1 star, disappointing experience.", "author": "Regina L."}

We hadn't been there in about 2 years.\n\nThe restaurant was busy, but not full as there was plenty of tables. The hostess sat us at a table placed between the kitchen and the bathrooms. We asked to be moved and she begrudgingly complied. We than waited 20 minutes for a waiter. (The hostess apparently never assigned the table to a waiter). In the meantime, a busboy dropped a bunch of napkins on the table (while we sat) as well as silverware.  It was up to us to set the table.\n\nI should note that at this point I went to use the men's room. Honestly, it was filthy and smelled, There were paper towels on the floor which was also wet. Obviously, there was nobody checking the cleanliness.\n\nBack at the table, I noticed that the menu had changed, from a rather large selection to only a few pages. Being a cold night, my wife and I were in the mood for a large bowl of Chicken Matzoh ball soup. They don't serve it anymore, only a small cup for $9.00. We, therefore decided on a corned beef sandwich for me and pastrami for my wife. Note that each sandwich was now $19.00 dollars. For that type of money you'd expect a nice full sandwich (ex NY'ers would know what I mean) however the size was average. The corned beef had no flavor and it appeared to have been sitting in boiling water for hours. Just awful! Similar for the Pastrami. The potato salad did have flavor...of a huge amount of mayonnaise. Again...awful! \nWe left most of the food on the plate, paid the bill and left. My wife wanted to use the ladies room but I advised her to wait till we walked over to Davies.\n\nNow, I realize San Francisco is an expensive city and I understand that prices need to rise to keep up, however there is no excuse for the quality of the food to have taken such a nosedive.\nFurthermore, the attitude of the hostess was inexcusable.\n\nMax's was an institution, a place to quench my occasional NY cravings as well as a pleasant place to have a good meal.

We saw the good reviews and decided to give it a try, seeing as to how it's only about 4 blocks away from Davies Symphony Hall. They provide so much dining space, and the black walls make for a fancy ambiance. We were probably the youngest people in there! What truly makes this cafe fancier than most, though, is the pianist serenading diners with Sinatra and other love songs. They are at the perfect volume so that it is not overbearing to conversation/general restaurant function. There is also a bar. The menu was average American food, but seemed to involve more unique presentation and/or ingredients. Definitely pricier too, but the portion sizes were generous. The French fries with the fish and chips are seasoned and so delicious, but the fish being breaded differently took a little bit of getting used to. Despite the outside of it, the inside of the fish was perfectly prepared! Our waiter checked in on us more than once & allowed us to get our check early and get take out boxes once we asked. There's a cute sign on the door saying \"good for a diet, bad for a diet, critics are not welcome!\" The ambiance was a breath of fresh air, so we will have to visit again whenever we have more time to thoroughly enjoy it.", "author": "Aly G."}

The yelp app showed the family-friendly places in the theater district were few and far between. Max's was really the only obvious choice, being a mere block away. We made a beeline.\n\nOn entering, we discovered we were not alone. The foyer was filled to the brim with waiting families, some on their way to The Nutcracker performance nearby. I sheepishly asked the wait time at the host desk and they said \"15 minutes.\"  Though I was extremely doubtful, I gave them my name, got a pager and sat with the family.  To their word, 15 minutes later we had a nice window table with menus in hand. I was amazed.\n\nMy hungry family ordered quickly.  I also opted for coffee and bloody mary (Hey, they were half price!). The coffee was good, and the bloody mary was spot-on; They even rimmed the glass with celery salt. Yum.\n \nMy huevos rancheros plate was much much better than I expected. It included perfectly-cooked eggs, good beans, guacamole, and home fries. Plus, triple-sized, delicious, homemade tortilla chips were tucked in around the sides. And it wasn't overburdened with cheese, like most places.\n\nI then polled the family on their opinion:\n  The oldest daughter: \"I love this place!\"\n  The wife: \"mreeymgudmm\" (in the middle of enjoying her salad)\n  The youngest daughter: \"Can we come back here?\"\n\nIn the end the news was both good and bad. \nThe good - we have a decent, family place to eat for the next theater trip. \nThe bad - my kids will now expect to always come here whenever we're in the neighborhood.", "author": "Dan B."}

The crust was seem not cooked all the way in the middle.  So I decided to pack the rest...OMG, when I was trying to pack the rest of my pot pie, there was a DEAD COOKED FLY on the side of the crust!!!!!!!!!!  WTF!  I ate half that and didn't realized. I got one of the wait staff and she quickly showed it to Miguel and he brought to their managers or GM's attention.  The GM apologized and said he will comp my meal and drinks and ask if I want anything else...I Said NO.

It comes with a tasty side salad of fresh corn, arugula, red onions, and tomatoes, lightly dressed. If you come by later in the evening, they have a tendency to run out of certain items. We opted for the apple pie and chuckled as a flyer saucer of a pie landed on our table. I'd forgotten that Max's does it BIG. It was a tad dry, heavy on the crust and encrusted with sugar.

The receipt I received only says \"PM takeout\", no name. So I cannot reference a name. Anyhow, I've never experienced this level of rudeness and poor customer service here ever! The guy made such an easy order complicated. First of all, he tried twice to charge me for salads and then couldn't understand that I asked for no dressing inside the wrap. Rudely, he would try to confirm my order and when he finally got it right he didn't apologize. \nThe first wrap was completed in 5minutes but I waited almost 20 minutes for the second. Mind you, there were no customers before me and he did not have to take any orders while mine should've been completed. My order being that it were the wraps, he makes them at the counter in front of customers. While waiting, I could see he kept leaving the station to make my order. Looked like he kept go no into the kitchen. Every time he left with his gloves on and returned without gloves. Mentioned something about waiting for more chicken. Fine but while I'm waiting he should apologize for the wait and ask if I needed something to drink. Neither happened which in my opinion is unnecessary incompetence. You know most people don't want to believe restaurants \"tamper\" or grossly handle their food but by his incompetence and rude demeanor, I wouldn't be surprised if every time he left, he was doing something to my order.

At first, seeing the very mixed reviews here on Yelp made me feel a lot of trepidation as part of the holiday planning committee. But we choose the venue for it's convenient location. It ended up being a huge success! This place was beautifully decorated for the holidays (snowflakes, Christmas decor etc adorned the ceilings), the food was very affordable ($20/pp average cost for buffet style food including salmon, chicken, vegetarian options, salads, and desserts), open cash bar was efficient and cheap, waiters were very responsive in getting our drinks, and the food was surprisingly delicious and fresh tasting. The best part was that we were able to rent a live pianist which gave the party a festive, classy vibe for a super low price. Pianist ended up being very talented and even played requested songs and allowed some of us to karaoke. I really have to recommend this place for office parties now.", "author": "Crystal Y."}

Combination of tasty pastrami sandwiches and opera singing waiters was amazing. Two nights ago, however, I decided to try the restaurant again, just before the symphony.  I made a BIG mistake by ordering something other than the usual deli food---a shrimp louis salad.  It looked good.  Nice big shrimp on a bed of vegetables, with the classic \"louis\" or thousand island dressing. The taste, however, was what you would expect to find in a Bakersfield Applebees.  To begin with, the shrimp were tough, woody and not completely thawed out.  I couldn't believe the icy center of each cardboard-like shrimp, so I offered one to my business colleague, and he found the icy heart of the shrimp to be equally nasty.  The vegetables tasted like they came out of those hermetically sealed plastic bags, where they have been lingering for months.  I assume the sandwiches and burgers are still good.  Stick with them!  And the pianist (no opera singers this time) was excellent.", "author": "Norman R."}

The location is great, especially if you are planning to see a show later that night.  For better of worse, Max's has great windows that look out onto Van Ness.  During dinner, we were treated to a biker coalition that included many nude riders.  One word.  Ouch!\n\nThe food was very enjoyable.  The caesar salad was standard--nothing special.  I did appreciate that the quantity of caesar dressing was held in check.  The Max n Cheese was great.  The different cheeses and flavorings, along with the bacon and bread crumbs, created a both tasty and fancy macaroni and cheese dish.  My only recommendation would be to increase the volume of cheese, bacon, etc. and decrease the volume of pasta.  The cheese, bacon, and bread crumbs were just that good!\n\nFinally, the cake.  My in-laws have been talking about this cake since I joined the family, so my first bite brought years of anticipation along with it.  I will say this--it was very good.  The cake was moist, the ganache was rich, and the buttercream frosting was light.  Add a scoop of vanilla ice cream, and it was quite the dessert.

Sat down at noon, waiter came 10 minutes later -- drinks were delivered another 10 minutes later.  When the food finally arrived about 30 minutes after we were seated, it was wrong.  Waiter didn't even apologize -- and then he never stopped by our table again until we tracked him down for the bill.\n\nI will still go to Max's -- just not this location.  Something is SERIOUSLY wrong with the way this location operates.  I miss the days when the servers were friendly, the service prompt and the orders were correct.  Thankfully, the last time I was at the Stanford location and the San Ramon location, everything was fine.  I think the fat lady is singing at the Opera Plaza location...", "author": "G M."}

I mean, I can be as vain as the next person, but there's only so much of myself, I can look at.\n\nAlso, while you're at it, Mr. Max, maybe you should train your servers not to have a horrified look of disgust on their face when asked by a patron if a particular item on the menu is good or not.  The server tried to cover it up by saying, \"Oh, no, no, it's good, it's really good, I DO like it!\"  I mean, I may be a little slow, but I'm not that slow.  It probably would have helped also if the server could have looked me in the eye, at any point, during the time he was providing service to our table.  \n\nIf the food made up for the lack in service, I would have given a higher rating, but unfortunately, my food was also not up to par.  I had the BBQ pulled pork sandwich, which comes with sweet potato fries and coleslaw.  The meat and BBQ sauce was bland, and the roll didn't really stand up to the sauce, which made the sandwich bread basically turn mushy.  The best part of my meal was the sweet potato fries and even they were just average, really.  They weren't as crunchy or as flavorful as I'd prefer.\n\nAlso, at the end of our meal, we were overcharged for one of the items because they had not corrected the price on the lunch menu and charged us the price from their dinner menu instead.  If the person who was overcharged wasn't such a penny pinching, Groupon deal using, tightwad, none of the rest of us would have caught that error. The server apologized and corrected the error, but seemed a little irked by the complaint in general.  \n\nWith so many other restaurant options in the area, I don't think I'll be coming around to Max's again, anytime soon.", "author": "Danielle O."}

But when it came time to take our order, he did not write any of the 5 entrees down and almost all of them had exceptions. And we kept suggesting that he should write it down. Of course 2 of the orders were wrong and he accused my husband of lying about his order. We then asked to speak with the manager and in front of the manager he again accused my husband of lying. What happened to the customer is always right?\n The two meals he brought that were incorrect were inedible. And we were only comped for one. Therefore, no tip.

If one wants a better culinary experience there are plenty of good restaurants in the area.\n\nMy big issue is the service.  For example, last night we arrived at 6:00 and were seated about five minutes later.  We did not see our waiter until about 6:25.  We told him that we had 7:30 opera tickets, to which he replied \"I can't guarantee anything\" regarding when we would get our food.  We ordered our drinks and food at the same time.  Fifteen minutes later our food came out, but our drinks were nowhere to be seen.  After prompting the bus person to find our waiter, he delivered our drinks a few minutes later.  Our waiter didn't display any sign of urgency despite the busy night.  It appeared that he just didn't care.\n\nMy one star for Max's is not for our single experience last night.  Max's has earned this star based upon poor and indifferent service on most of my visits.\n\nI'd rather eat at the McDonald's across the street than return to Max's.

After an afternoon of walking throughout Union Square then walking up into the Tenderloin I made a turn onto Van Ness and ended up at Opera Plaza.  I needed refreshment and I needed nourishment so I decided to step into Max's Opera Cafe.  The only other Max's I've ever eaten in was the one that use to be on Third near the Moscone Center.  I remember I ate there often because their food was always good and \"homey\".\n\nMax's Opera Cafe was a bit of a disappointment though.  When only the service highlights the visit that's not a very good sign.  I received outstanding service.  I was seated promptly and the waiter/server was polite and courteous throughout the afternoon bringing my beverage to me quickly, bringing my food to me quickly, checking up on me twice and just being a very good waiter.\n\nI ordered the table brewed peach ice tea which I thought was kind of cool and unique.  The waiter brought a tall glass filled to the very top with ice cubes.  He explained to me that the syrupy concoction in the base of my glass was the peach-flavored syrup.  In a small metal pot was a tea bag submerged in hot water.  The waiter suggested that I could mix the tea into the glass whenever I felt like depending on how strong I wanted the tea to be.  I like my tea super strong and the mixed-in ice tea was exactly the refreshment I needed.\n\nI decided against ordering a burger and ended up choosing Max's Famous Meatloaf served with mashed potatoes and a vegetable.  The food arrived in less than five minutes along with a metal basket containing a couple of hot rolls and several cubes of butter.  There was a plain white dinner roll, and a darker roll which had a pleasant cinnamon scent to it.  I cracked open the darker roll to find that it was indeed a raisin roll filled with dark and golden raisins.  The roll had a thin, chewy crust and soft, chewy bread.  It was excellent.\n\nI wish I could have said the same of the main entree.  I'm not sure why the meatloaf is \"famous\" because it certainly was not for the taste which was pretty generic.  The thick slice of meat patty had good firmness and nice texture, but I was not satisfied with its taste at all.  It was completely covered in a dark brown mushroom sauce which simply tasted sodium heavy.  The potatoes were lukewarm kept on the warm side only because a thick, gooey light brown gravy was piping hot.  The carrots were quite obviously reheated since they had now reached a level of extreme rubberness.  Had there not been diners seated around me I might have certainly tossed a piece of carrot off the table top just to see how high it would bounce.\n\nThe desserts looked decadent, but I passed on them.  If there is a next time here I'll consider a burger.  Three stars but just barely.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

The kitchen is exposed and the chef is placing orders that are done right there on a counter where tons of people are walking in to get a table. The salad dressings are in open containers at waist length as well amongst other food in the \"please wait to be seated\" line. It's very unsanitary. Once the hostess has your information, whole you're waiting for an available table; the only place to stand is the \"waiting area\" which is directly in the center of the restaurant and in the middle of server traffic. Which is awkward along with annoying. When I finally got a table, my husband and I ordered a salad to split. Unfortunately the menu didn't look appetizing, so we chose a safe dish. We ordered the chicken Cesar salad and told the waitress we would like to split the dish. She brings out the salad on one plate with no chicken. We asked for another plate since we would be splitting the dish, I assumed she was going to bring one when she served the salad but no. We never received another dish, or water refills.

And I realized it was from the high fructose corn syrup that I had been served to me at Max's.  The next day I got a rash that lasted for 2 more days.  This kind of  corn syrup served as Maple syrup , you don't usually find in San Francisco where people are foodies and also care about what they put in their bodies.

Last night, however, we were held in limbo standing in a doorway waiting for almost 45 minutes (they had said 20 mins. when we came in). We waited so long there was no time to make another plan for dinner before our show. Not only that, but one customer (who had come in after us) complained to the manager and got seated ahead of us. So not only did they 1. misstate the wait time, 2. not communicate with us regarding their mistake, and 3. leave us with no options, they 4. did not stick to the order in which people arrived and rewarded the angriest customers instead.

It's gotta a style.  Max's to me is one of the restaurants that represent America.  \n\nI don't want to remember this bitter dining experience, so I'm just listing up the lessons I learned from it.\n\n1. Don't push yourself to eat at a restaurant near closing time.  Your waitress wants to go home & so do kitchen people (see the photos).  The bathroom could be nasty.\n\n2. Don't eat at a restaurant when the manager or owner isn't present.  It's just my guess, but things could have been better with him.\n\n3. Don't take out desserts; they might be spoiled, and you get VERY disappointed on the way back home in your car.  I was so upset that made me speechless the entire trip (which my hubby might have appreciated, which I won't know).\n\n4. Following #3, if you ever take out desserts, don't get your expectation too high; always be prepared the unexpected & the worst.\n\nTo conclude, it might have been mere bad timing.  Max's could be a REALLY nice restaurant, and I REALLY regret to say this, but I'm resting Max's for good in my book.", "author": "Terri M."}

It is something we look forward to, as I am sure the restaurant is well aware of the Nutcracker customers that follow this same tradition.\n\nWe recently dined at Max's on 12/14/11. We arrived at 5:00p, and were the first table in an empty section. While waiting for over 20 minutes for a server to take a drink order, we noticed the section getting fuller and fuller. When our server, Blanca, finally decided to come to our table, we could tell that she was in a foul mood. \n\nWe finally got served our dinner after a full hour of waiting. The restaurant was in full swing by then with a line forming on the waiting list. One would think, if you are the manager of a restaurant with guaranteed customers going to the Nutcracker, that you would schedule your best and most efficient servers to make the most money, right?\n\nBlanca forgot most of our order. She left ALL of the dirty plates and cups on the table for the ENTIRE meal. I had to hunt her down to order a glass of wine with my dinner, and again to order dessert for my kids. Whenever you tried to get her attention, she blatantly ignored us - as well as most of the table in her section.\n\nWhile I usually am not one to post comments on Yelp, this disaster of a dining experience was just too much to ignore. The final straw was when she gave us our bill with a built in 18% gratuity. Seriously? So you flat out ignore your customers, forget most of their order, never clear the table or ask if we need anything, and then slap our faces with 18% for doing NOTHING? A complete insult in my opinion!\n\nSadly, I think our dining tradition prior to attending the ballet will be finding a new location. It's too bad that the management has become so uninterested in customer experience. In these tough economic times, customer service is EVERYTHING and should NEVER be taken for granted.", "author": "Laura B."}

And it was the birthday of a loved one who has since passed away, so we were all feeling a bit melancholic.  And nostalgic.  And hungry.  And driving down Gough.  When someone suggested Max's.  \n\nSo glad we went -- we were greeted warmly, and seated at a table near the grand piano.  The pianist was playing a wonderful medley of Broadway show tunes -- coincidentally some of our departed loved one's favorites.  Then, one of the waiters stood at the mic and sang.  It was so beautiful.  At a nearby table, a birthday was being celebrated, and a trio of waiters sang \"Happy Birthday\" in perfect harmony. Such synchronicity is a joy. \n\nThe bread was great, a nice selection of sourdough rolls, walnut-cranberry rolls and whole wheat slices.  And our waiter very graciously kept refilling the basket.  Entrees were fine -- but what was really memorable were the desserts -- so yummy, and such giant portions -- we ordered the Opera Cake, the hot fudge sundae, and the apple crisp.  Wow!  So fabulous!

The manager commented that they're around no matter what, and hiring an exterminator doesn't help much.\nToo bad, because expensive high-rises will be going up on the length of this section of Van Ness.

The bread is the obvious building block for a good sando no matter what you put in between.  With this said, off I go to Max's for yet another tragic experience.  Real busy evening, so I sat at the counter.  The bartenders (two woman) were chatting it up and really could care less about their customers at the counter, nor I imagine the whole place for they are the beverage makers for all.  After I ordered a cocktail, I put my food order in at the same time.  One of the bartenders was wiping silverware in front of me, handling the top of the silverware to wipe the handles, enough said.  I ordered the simplest of all dishes one could at a \"Diner\", a corned beef sando with potato salad and slaw on the side.  The only bright spot of this clip joint is that my food came out quickly.  The bread (RYE OF COURSE) was of the cheapest, low end brand possibly known to man.  The crust of a good rye should have a snap to it, the bread should have some substance in order to handle the weight of even a small sando.  I could have taken both slices and squeezed them up into a little ball for they had no weight no substance and worst of all, zero flavor, YES bread should have flavor, especially rye bread.  The corned beef was dry with no juice and very little seasoning at all.  It tasted like supermarket meat that was in your home frig for 2 weeks.  The potato salad was served in a little ceramic cup.  Once I turned it over it fell out of the cup on the plate as if it was hard construction spackle, dry flavorless gunk, that was obviously sitting in that cup for a long time.  The Cole slaw, well, listen, if I wanted a healthy meal I eat some spinach and drink some type of seaweed juice served to me by a mermaid.  I don't want shredded cabbage with two strips of carrots and no mayo.  On the dry scale the corned beef and potato salad made the Cole slaw seem dripping wet with lovely deliciousness.  \n\n  Who am I going to complain to, the bartender who just grubbed up the fork she will give to the next customer, why waste my time.  I got up and found the \"manager\", an Asian fellow.  He was extremely busy so I asked to talk with him and stood back until he had a moment.  When he did, I calmly explained to him that the food was BAD!   At this time a white fellow (manager?) came up to us and abruptly interrupted us and began to quiz me on how much of the food I ate, what I had to drink, was it paid for etc.  I explained to him that I was not after a free 3 bites of the sando and a drink, which I would have paid for.  However, after this rude abrasive nasty little man kept pressing the issue, I asked for my bill, paid it, took one last look around never to return\n\n  What a wonderful place Max's Opera caf\u00e9 used to be.  Now it is just a clip joint for tourists, one time patrons or folks who just drink there and know better then to eat dried out bad food.

The restaurant wasn't listed on Open Table, just the other locations.  Checked back on the 17th and there's the restaurant.  Made a reservation for dinner in advance of a concert at 7:30.\nWalked in, was seated right away.  It took about 10 minutes to get offered bread/water, take order, once that happened another 15 minutes to get food.  Clock is ticking . . .\nThe restaurant is busy, old folks, families, couples out for a date, but the majority of us are seated in the front room, closest to the kitchen and the exit.  The back room I notice is practically empty.\nFood comes, hamburger for the kid, Chinese chicken salad for me - chicken on salad in strips, with fried crust falling off.  Hamburger is a bit dry, but fries are hot.  Overall a \"ok\" meal, though the table next to us, was not happy at all about the service.  They were very vocal about their displeasure.\nAnd a side note, the hostess, cute young woman, wearing leggings and a short top, I think she forgot to put on her skirt.  Overall entertaining meal.  I don't know if I would go back, I am still on the fence on that.", "author": "Ann R."}

Both of us have been going to this place for many years, although neither of us has been there lately. We had reservations and were seated by a harried and overworked hostess after waiting our turn in line. We were given a nice table by the window, but our experience went down hill after that. The table was clean, but very sticky -- this was probably a problem with an inappropriate finish for the table. The waitress came by after about 15 minutes, brought our drinks about 10 minutes later, took our order and promptly forgot about it. We reminded her and finally got our meal after about an hour's wait. The place was obviously sorely understaffed. I was given the wrong dish -- an appetizer, not the entree I ordered -- but was not charged for it. My wife got a corned beef sandwich with stale bread. I ordered a second beer, but I sent it back, after having waited so long that I had given it up for dead. The men's restroom was dreadful -- urine splashed all over the floor and a large roll of paper towels lying on the sink, next to a water-stained notice about saving water. I went in at the end of our meal -- no change. Near our table, the carpet was cut from one wall to the other, its fraying edges lying open. The rest of carpet looked like it hadn't been swept all day; it was strewn with crumbs and sundry debris. \n         It's sad to see the deterioration in both food, service, and physical surroundings. We'd love to return, but before that happens, we'll have to hear of some improvement from friends or see some more positive reviews.", "author": "John Q."}

We've been going recently every Friday night and unfortunately we stopped after most of noticed little changes and short cuts creeping into the menu and service.  Our last visit was our final visit, at least for the time being, because one in our regular group who normally orders their recently shrinking burger, decided to order the Old Fashion Turkey dinner which sounds great on the menu and was a startling, beyond repair disaster that night.  It came after the rest of us had our entree's and when it came we all shuddered as we looked at the platter.  There were the potatos, carrots, cranberry sauce, but the turkey itself was Kirkwood Luncheon slide turkey rolled up to make it look a little better than it is.  Everything on his plate cold and he asked the waiter what happened to fresh cooked REAL turkey and the waiter was at a loss and seemed embarrassed about the $18.95 presentation.  He wanted nothing to replace his dinner and each of the rest of us experience sympathy pains and felt like we were being ripped off by Max's for the first time in all those years.  My burger and the patty melt the week before have shrunk, the portions of everything seems to have grown smaller almost overnight, and the staff seems new to boot.

This is our third and definitely last time dining here.  \n\nOn the first visit, we ordered their signature chicken pot pie.  It arrived with 25% of the crust obviously burnt, yet the waiter served the dish anyway.  Needless to say, we asked for a replacement and, after some time, the waiter returned with what was obviously the old pie reassembled and this time with a smaller crust covering and less filling.  That was a major disappointment, but we decided to give them another chance.  \n\nOn our second visit, they were again not very good, as the pie lacked enough gravy to keep the chicken moist, so let's say it was like chicken pot \"cookie.\"  We therefore decided against ordering the chicken pot pie on our third and final visit.    \n\nI first have to say that we would not have ordinarily chosen Max (Van Ness) after the two dissatisfying dinners, but we had a show to attend that was close by and timing was essential.  This time however, we decided to order something different, as we figured the chicken pot pie would be another disappointment.  In its place, we ordered the overpriced (half slab for $19) ribs and tri-mushroom pasta.  \n\nThe pasta was tasty and similar to other Max restaurants, except the quantity appeared less.  As for the ribs, they were cooler than room temperature and the BBQ sauce was a last minute spread that was also not heated.  Worse yet, the meat did not fall off the bone as they should, so obviously undercooked.  There's something about having to use fork and knife to eat ribs that really did not sit well with good old BBQ food.\n\nWe won't be patronizing this place unless everything else close by is closed or too busy, and we do not have time to wait; otherwise, we'll continue to patronize Max's on GEARY BLVD instead where their chicken pot pie is consistently excellent, as well as there many other dishes that we tried.\n\nOne would think that the restaurant manager here at Van Ness would have concerns about the overall (under 3 stars) reviews, but guess he believes his is irreplaceable.", "author": "Anson D."}

At Max's establishments, there is a list of Laws the staff is not supposed to break.  At least three of them were broken today.  \n\nIt started with the burger sliders which were described on the menu as coming with crispy onion strings.  When the sliders arrived, they were draped with RAW dehydrated wilty red onion strings.  My friend and I were confused because the red onions sure as heck didn't look fried.  This was when Law #16 was broken, because the server is supposed to check-in with us within four minutes of serving the entrees.  So... the one time something is wrong, I couldn't locate anyone on the staff to tell.  I decided to ask the girl serving water if the red onions were the crispy onion strings and she stared at me like I was speaking Martian and said \"I don't know\" and walked away without a look back.  A few minutes later, I managed to flag down our waitress to ask the same question.  Apparently, she didn't know either, because she ended up taking our dish away to the kitchen and mumbled something about the kitchen possibly having run out of crispy onion strings.  Huh?  If that was the case, shouldn't she have told us in the first place so we could have ordered something else? Who knowingly serves an incorrect dish?  (Now I am channeling Kitchen Nightmares.)  When she brought our plate of sliders back, she told us that they had been served the \"old way\" (whatever that means) and that a plate of crispy onion strings was on the way.  \"I just work here\" should be Max's new motto. \n\nThe manager finally delivered the onion strings and explained that the cook had plated our sliders incorrectly since the menu has changed.  I eat out A LOT and have never had this happen to me before.  It is just plain sloppy workmanship.  By now the sliders were cold.  Around this time, Law #13 was broken.  The ketchup was supposed to come before the sliders, but no one thought to bring it until the missing crispy onion strings arrived.  \n\nTo add insult to injury, we left $40 for a check totaling $20.66.  The waitress asked if we wanted change.  DUH!   She broke Law #17 by merely asking if we wanted change.  For each of the broken laws we were supposed to get a slice of Niagara Falls cake for the table.  Without the laws in front of us, we didn't know to bring it up. We confirmed these laws on the website when researching a promotion we previously saw online at their site called \"10-15-20\".  The restaurant told us the promotion was posted on the webpage by the \"old owner\" so I guess that means they weren't honoring it?

I have been coming here with smaller parties for over 20 years with much better service and food so I'm wondering what happened.  I might give them one more chance and then skip them in the future.

Here are my ratings/reviews for all the food that I have eaten here. \n\nPrime Rib and Creamed Spinach - 5/5 Stars!\n\nThe prime rib was extremely tender, just the way I like it. It was accompanied excellently with the creamed spinach which had a nice tang of cream.  \n\n\nDungeness Crab Cakes - 5/5 Stars!\n\nExquisite! Hands down my favorite food on the menu. The inside of the crab cakes are superb. The combination of the juicy crab with the crunchy crab shell is just sensational. The crab cakes are hard to beat..\n\n\nCaesar Salad - 4/5 Stars\n\n4/5 stars is not bad for one of my favorite salads. I am a caesar salad lover and its hard to impress me. The dressing and croutons were decent although the dressing could be a tad bit richer with a bit more dijon mustard or worcestershire sauce. That combined with maybe a bit fresher romaine lettuce leaves and it would certainly bring it up to 5 stars. \n\n\nChicken Caesar Wrap - 3/5 Stars\n\nNot bad. It's a convenient food that you can take on the run and its pretty tasty. The only thing is that it's a little heavy on the sauce. If they just put a little less sauce on it, it would be perfect!\n\n\nChicken Liver - 3/5 Stars\n\nTasted just the way I thought. Some people love it and can eat it by the spoon. Me personally, I am not a huge fan but its typical of chicken liver anywhere else. It's just not my cup of tea.\n\n\nOmelette - 4/5 Stars\n\nI came here for breakfast once and I got the omelette with mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, and a side of chicken sausage. It was decent and I would definitely recommend coming here for breakfast. It's also perfect for hangovers :)\n\n\nMatzah Ball Soup - 3/5 Stars\n\nI know people that go crazy over this and love it to death. Nothing too special about it except its great on a cold day. \n\n\nLamb Burger - 5/5 Stars!\n\nLamb... so yummy. Enough said..\n\n\nAhi Tuna - 4/5 Stars\n\nAhi Tuna, I almost forgot! It was crusted and seasoned with sesame which had a nice tangy spike to it. I personally thought the ahi tuna was very tender which is great.\n\n\nGrandma's Honey Chicken - 5/5 Stars!\n\nOne of my top 3 favorites. This meal was perfect. The glazed honey sauce contrasting with the tender seasoned chicken was divine.. I would highly recommend this!\n\n\n\nOverall, I've had great experiences with Max's. Dungenes crab cakes takes the cake for being top-notch. The crispness of the crab cake is potent and unmatched. The servers are extremely friendly and the vibe is nice. Can't wait to come again!", "author": "Brian W."}

I moved out of the City a few years ago but just picked up a job working in the City a couple of days a week. A few weeks ago I went into Max's and asked for a brisket sandwich on a French roll. When I got back to work, the girl had made my sandwich on wheat bread and it fell apart on the floor as I was unwrapping it. That was a waste of $10. I went back the following week and asked for a matzo ball soup which I love. I got the soup but with cinnamon bread instead of sour dough bread. Today, I went in for a brisket sandwich. I placed my order with the girl behind the counter. She took my order then went back to doing inventory or something on the computer. I am on my lunch hour and do not have a lot of time to wait. A waiters on wheels person came to pick up an order and she was ignored as well. I said to the waiters on wheels person (loud enough for the employee to hear) that I was pressed on time. The employee continued to ignore me and do whatever she was doing. I turned around and left. She never tried to call me or to apologize or to even ask why I was leaving. Never again. You lost a customer of at least 20 years. Their prices are high and their service certainly went down. I do not need to be giving them any more of my money.

That's an interesting perk.  But as you all know, singers are often primadonnas which means that there is a risk of emotionally unstable service.  Although I can report that this wasn't the case, the service was very slow even after we warned them we had an 8pm opera to see.  Could our server have been more concerned about hitting a certain note for a song than the status of our order?\n\nThe food was not bad.  The prime rib was excellent, and the desserts are gigantic.  One order is enough for three people.\n\nThe seating for the most part is too tight unless you get lucky and get a booth, which there are a few.\n\nThe menu selection is extensive.

We called the week before for a reservation for 10 and were given a noon time: great, our show is at 2 that gives us an hour and a half. \nWe arrived at 5 to noon and were dismayed to have to stand in a line to check in. Why accept reservations if you need to stand in a line 30 deep just to check in? I tried to explain to the hostess we had a reservation and she ignored me. So we stood in line and were seated at 1210. Table was nice, at the corner of Van Ness.\nWe were greeted by our server about 5 minutes later. He took our drink orders, and 10 minutes later they arrived. We then place out lunch order.\nAt 1:20 the plates began to arrive. 2 at a time. Unacceptable wait time, the salads had been obviously ready for awhile as the lettuce was limp and wilted. Burger veggies same, and burgers lukewarm. One arrived tartare style, when we told the hostess it was raw and needed to go back she asked \"what am I supposed to do with this?\" Really you have never had a dish returned to the kitchen? At this point now 1:30 and pressed for time. We asked for a manager twice and finally had to seek him out. To his credit he cut the bill in half, but we will never return here. They obviously have no idea how to staff for seasonal times - and in such proximity to the opera house and symphony one would expect they would know how to anticipate this. On the positive side, I had the salmon sandwich and it was great. The grilled cheese for the 6 year old passed muster. The rest, well not so great. Stay away! Extremely poor service.", "author": "Keith C."}

There used to be a Max's down here in San Jose where I could get my fix of the Fantasy Torte, but that is no longer the case, so I was thrilled to find out I could have a piece last night.  We arrived at the Van Ness location about 9:00.  There was only a scattering of tables with customers finishing up their meals, but it took over five minutes before a server acknowledged that we sat down.  After giving us eye contact, the server again disappeared for a few minutes before coming over to greet us.  All of that waiting time was dangerous, because I actually looked at the dessert menu.  It was a done deal that I would have the fantasy torte, but the B52 sundae was calling out to me as well.  The wheels in my brain were turning, so I asked the server to check if they had a whole Fantasy Torte in the kitchen somewhere.  They did, so I knew exactly what to order.  I had the simplistic B52 sundae, which was just vanilla ice cream, whip cream, and a shot of Kahlua, amaretto, and Bailey's. In addition, I bought a whole fantasy torte to take home.  We cut off one slice to devour the perfect combination of cheesecake, chocolate mousse, and chocolate cake covered in chocolate.  AHHH!  We also ordered a piece of New York cheesecake with blueberries and some drinks.  Service left a lot to be desired, but Max's was able to fill my craving for the Fantasy Torte.  I sliced, wrapped, and froze the rest at home.  Now I won't have to drive to San Francisco the next time I want to dive into my favorite rich, creamy, decadent dessert.

We decided today to go again after today's performance. For reservations, I made a reservation for 5:45 which was the earliest I could after the performance ended.  It ended a little earlier so we walked over and the place was pretty empty. I told her I had a 5:45 reservation but would like a table if possible. She barely acknowledged me but seated us in one of the many tables.  I should have known the service was going to be bad since it took the server at least 10 minutes to merely acknowledge our existence. By the time she came back we ordered everything (drinks, appetizers, entree).  It took at least 30 minutes to get our food. Then she dropped it off and practically ran away without saying anything but I stopped her and asked about the appetizer. She said, \"You didn't order any.\"  I said I did and you wrote it down. She looked at her slip of paper and said, \"oh, do you still want it?\"  I said no and she turned around and left. The entire meal she never came back to check on our drinks or see how we were doing. She was very attentive to tables around us. I hate to mention this, but we are an Asian family and all the other tables where white families and couples.  We ordered dessert and it took over 15 minutes to get a piece of cheesecake.  When she was walking by I asked for the check and she didn't turn but yelled \"yea\". At this point I think she's pissed at me about something. Anyway, we finally paid and left without talking to her. Horrible and rude, I'll never go back there.

OK, so he's 38, but really, aren't we all children who want to be taken care of when we have the flu?\n\nI thought that some matzo-ball soup was in order and this was the closest place to my office to get some on my way home. I remembered having their latkes at a holiday party that were delish, so I got some of those, too. Then I figured that with the soup I should get a sandwich to share. Here's where a problem lay. My standard for Jewish deli food is the fabulous, amazing \"Famous 4th Street Deli\" in Philly, where the sandwiches are big enough to feed a family of 6 and the matzo-ball soup, which is the best I've ever had, could feed Somalia. So at Max's, I was expecting huge portions of yummy food. \n\nThe large soup was just enough for the 2 of us, but it wasn't spectacular. I was happy that it wasn't too salty, a problem that many soups have, and that the chicken was white meat. It was OK, but it didn't leave me anticipating my next visit. Same with the roast beef sandwich. It was a decent sandwich; nothing to complain about. But nothing to really remember, either. The latkes, however, were just as tasty as I remembered them. \n\nSo, next time I have a sick child at home, I'll try one of the Russian places on Geary that always seem to have a good supply of fresh matzo-ball soup.", "author": "Amy B."}

We've eaten at Max's in Corte Madera, the late and unlamented Max's Opera Cafe in Walnut Creek, whose singing wait staff were probably part of the farm team for this one, the excellent but short lived one across from the ballpark and the execrable one in San Ramon.  We've had good meals at this one, but this wasn't one and I doubt we'll bother w/ Max's again.  Dennis Berkowitz is famous for his dislike of critics and still has a handwritten diatribe against one of Michael Bauer's reviews framed on the wall.  When Max's food was good that was cute.  As the quality of the food has deteriorated over the years it's lost its charm.  \n\nWe were told there would be a 45 minute wait and it was about that.  I ordered a lemon drop.  The best thing about it was the service (Alan brought it).  If the lemon drop at 2nd Street Bistro in Williamsburg was a 5, this was a 1.  It was thin, pale and tart.  The only sweetness was provided by the sugar on the rim.  Not a particularly appealing drink.  When we were seated our waitress immediately started to try to upsell us.  We told her we weren't interested in another drink and she pushed more than I thought was OK.  We told her we had an 8:00 concert.  By this time it was 7:00.  She brought us a basket of lovely warm rolls and butter.  Two of the rolls had raisins in them and one was plain sourdough.  They were tasty.  She took our order.  I had been debating between the mojito skirt steak, marinated in mint and lime and the traditional brisket.  Alan decided on the skirt steak, so I ordered the brisket.  Bad move.  We told the waitress we wanted to split a chopped vegetable salad.  The salad arrived unsplit, no extra plate.  Shortly after, she brought the entrees.  Alan's was cooked medium rare, as ordered.  It was good.  He gave me plenty bites.  The brisket, not so good.  It was sliced thin and wasn't especially moist or tasty.  Tam's is better, Bo's is better, mine is better, almost everyone's is better.  The best part was the roasted carrots that came w/ it.  I gave Alan lots of bites.  Of the brisket, not the carrots.  I got the better deal.  Our waitress was scarcely in attendance.  She checked by twice, Alan requested more water and the second time she brought it.  It didn't help the experience any that the tables were so close together that our \"table mates\" on one side were a singularly unpleasant pair about our age, of uncertain relationship, who gossiped about others' illnesses and deaths and sniped at each other throughout, bickered over sharing a desert, then figured out to the penny what each owed.", "author": "Toni M."}

It has or shall I say HAD, all of the major food groups; protein from the eggs and salmon, veggies from the largely cut tomatoes, red onions and whole olives, grains of course from the onion bagel, dairy from the wedges of swiss and muenster cheeses, and fruit from the garnishes of orange slices.  \n\nPerfection, no worries Mom, I have a \"balanced\" diet. \n\n So, I move to San Francisco, and on my 2nd day here, I jump on the bus and head to Max's.  I graciously wait, and wait and get to the counter to order, and am told matter of factly; we don't sell smoked salmon anymore.  WHAT? Wait, what?  \"we-do-not-sell-smoked-salmon\" No more smoked salmon?!  At a New York style cafe/deli?  Blasphemy!", "author": "Mai G."}

My mom's soup is extraordinary.  Her broth is sublime and her matzoh balls (or bumbahs as we call them) are nothing short of ethereal.  Often when she makes it, she'll exclaim \"I've outdone myself!\"  The funny thing is she doesn't even like matzoh ball soup.  And, she'll share her recipe with no one, only my sister.  She'll gladly tell you, however, that the number one ingredient in a matzoh ball is \"love.\"  \"You have to want to make a good matzoh ball otherwise you won't,\" she'd tell you.\n\nThis evening I was feeling a little under the weather.  Often when I do, I crave good ole Jewish chicken soup.  So, I dragged my goyish boyfriend here tonight so I could get my matzoh ball on.  Granted my standards are high but the bumbahs here were pretty bad.  They were kinda sweet as if they had added sugar.  Even the bf knew they were bad and he's from Iowa.  The broth & noodles were decent though.\n\nAll, however, was not lost.  I did get to indulge in a really good corned beef & pastrami sandwich.  The meat was moist and flavorful and not too fatty.  He got the pork chop which while a bit overdone came in really good, tangy sauce.\n\nThey had a piano player playing this evening which was a nice touch.  And, when she went on break the played Ella & Billie tunes which was cool.\n\nSo, all in all, this ain't my mom's house but it did in a pinch.", "author": "Jeff P."}

The waitstaff really did sing opera, and I hear they still do it at the Opera Plaza location.   \n\nI don't have to look at the menu when I go to Max's.  I want the Reuben sandwich.  These things are HUGE.  The longer they stand on your plate, the more the dressing soaks into the rye bread, but the crust stays crispy all the way through.  About 1/2 lb. of corned beef is the centerpiece of this sandwich, and the sauerkraut is just a little sour.  The last couple of times I have visited, I couldn't finish the sandwich.  Three sides came with it this time, but for me it is all about the sandwich.  I ordered a diet Coke to go along with it, and the waiter made sure there was always a glass on the table for me.  \n\nMy Lady, who is more sensible than I, ordered a small Cobb salad and tea.

I can keep it real, yo.\n\nFirst of all I have to mention that the chicken pot pie is amazing. ORDER IT NOW. Megan and I used to order it all the time and nosh on it in between serving customers. It's SO good. \n\nSecondly, the desserts are incredible as well. I'd recommend stopping in for dessert and drinks in the late evening. I LOVE the Niagara Falls cake-- chocolate cake with loads of white butter-cream frosting. So worth the sugar coma it induces! Also, the brownie sundae is heaven as well. Mmmmmm I think my blood sugar is spiking just thinking about it!\n\nThirdly, as said in other reviews, yes, most of the portions are HUGE. I can only eat half of that chicken pot pie. It's good to come here and split an appetizer and an entree with someone (unless you're one of those who enjoys having a muffin-top, of course). \n\nThey have a lot of different kinds of salads, which are, again, huge, and they are popular too. Their burgers are mediocre-- I wouldn't waste your money on one from here. Their pastrami sandwiches seem to be popular too, but that's not my cup of tea, so I couldn't tell ya!\n\nAlso, to be noted-- it gets super crowded here when there is an opera/performance, especially in December with the Nutcracker going on. There are loads of children running around. If you're like me, you'll avoid those times like the plague. :D\n\nLast thing to say-- they don't take reservations, so if you come here on a weekend night, especially on a \"performance\" night, you should probably be prepared to wait a while.", "author": "Tiffany R."}

About half of all the tables were taken but the restaurant did not give off a busy vibe. From what I could see, most of Max's patrons go here for a leisurely lunch. Since both my co-worker and I have an one hour lunch break, we did not feel pressed for time. With that said, we would've never gotten our waiter's attention without deliberately waving our hand in the air. \n\nOnce we got his attention, he sauntered over as if we were taking his precious time. When he found out that we wanted to order he gave us that \"oh, is that what you wanted? I'm too busy for you right now\" look and said \"I'll be back.\" Then walked away without another word. I've received better attention at CPK's. \n\nWhen he finally did return to take our order, his service was just as curt and inattentive. After he took our order, we never saw him again. Not to bring us our food. Not to refresh our drinks. Not to give us the bill. Not to tell us that he would be leaving. \n\nIn regards to the food, my co-worker and I shared a Lamb Burger on an Onion Roll served with french ries and crispy onions and a California Chicken Melt. I would say that the food was 3 1/2-star worthy. And the portions mirrored the price. But the waiter's service far overshadowed the food. \n\nI would not come back here.", "author": "Cynthia P."}

I have this distinct memory of sitting in our Toyota celica, driving to Max's and I was playing with this puzzle thing (extraneous information thus far) and, anyways, when we got there and we always went there, especially for my birthday with the parents---I got to pick out my birthday slice.  Which means, I got to go up to the big glassed case of desserts gleaming up in front of my 5 year old self.  I always picked the Niagara falls slice.  With a name like that, how could you not???  I remember the fan fare, the singing, the sparkling, the city lights and again: the magic.\r\n\r\nI went back recently for the first time since I was 5 or so.  I had gone to the palo one since many times.  I was sorely disappointed.  Kind of like going back to the swing set you saw as golden and delightful and perhaps new on retrospect going back no longer fits your behind, is graffitied or grown old, grass growing through the wood planks below, I no longer saw the magic. In fact it looked so, well---dated.  It looked like it needed a good remodel.  And that is when I realized that this may be due to the fact that it was pretty old and it was pretty new when I first went there as a child.  In any case, it just wasn't the same.  And I even ordered the same cake again for old times sake.", "author": "Lauren S."}

After several attempts over the last four years of working at City Hall and having desperate deli cravings absolutely dashed to pieces upon one crappy Max experience after another, I have sworn off for good. \n\nRecap of my last experience: \n\n(Scene) It is raining absolutely sideways, we run from City Hall to the safety of Opera Plaza.  Throw open the doors to Max's and slosh through the nearly empty restaurant to the hostess stand. \nHostess: Yeah? \nUs: Um, yeah.  We would like to get lunch. \nHostess: Well...you can sit at the bar.\n\nWe walk in the direction of her thumb, which she has just casually thrown over her shoulder, and sit down at the bar. \n\nMind you, Max's has just renovated from one horrific interior to something equally horrific, which is good because we have something to talk about as we wait for interminably long periods of time between any waitstaff attention throughout our meal. Honestly, it looks like a monster with a penchant for green and pink Smooth & Melty's lost his lunch inside a slick chinese restaurant.  I do like the chandeliers, though. On to the rest of our lunch....\n \nThe waiter brings us menus, does not ask if we would like drinks, and leaves.  Another waiter comes, gives us water, leaves.  A third waitress comes. We order. \n \n10 minutes later, we get our appetizer \"Baked Giant Mushrooms with Pecorino Cheese and Pesto\".  Now, wouldn't you think that they would be warm? Yes? Well, you would be wrong. Wouldn't you think the mushrooms would at least be large, if not giant? Wrong again.  We got 4 cold, not-so-big mushrooms in a tepid (at best) marinara sauce.  Generally, my lunch partner and I are not complainers--we are too afraid of spit.  In this case, however, we had to say something.  At two dollars a pop, we were not going to eat lukewarm mushrooms.  So we did.  The waitress STUCK HER THUMB in one of the mushrooms and said, \"yep, you're right\" and whisked them away.  She returned 10 MINUTES later with our plate maybe two degrees warmer than the last time, and made a huge deal about the fact that she gave us an extra, \"free\" mushroom, on her....Well thanks a ton, lady. \n \nOur lunch continues in this downhill trajectory...my buddy's Rueben comes with no 1000 dressing, and he has to ask for ketchup for his french-fries too (I know, bizarre request, but still...) The cheese on his sandwich is, yes, melted, which would imply that it was once warm, but in fact it too is chilly to the touch.  So okay, maybe warm food is not their thing? On to my salad...which I never found under the huge glob of sour cream that they put on top of it. \n \nOh, and the desserts, which used to be the restaurants only saving grace, have been downsized. This is not my imagination, we asked and it was confirmed. And don't even get me started about the time I got a half a salad for the bargain price of $17 dollars....", "author": "Alexis T."}

For lunch, it's a popular place. Heck, for dinner it's a popular place. This particular location has gone through a recent remodel. It's a bit more \"diner\" feel now with blacks and whites being a central color theme. Menu hasn't changed much though prices have gone up slightly.\n\nThe food is pretty consistent and usually fairly large in portion though you'll find newer items on the menu will usually start off with larger portions and then are pared down the longer they stay on the menu.  I'm particularly partial to the meat loaf, enchilada pie (which is usually a special), chicken pot pie (which has gotten smaller over time), and the turkey burger max.  For salads, give a try to Guy's Chinese Chicken salad though go for a half unless you are really hungry.\n\nIn the evenings the waitpeople also double as entertainment and will go up and sing with the pianst.  They started charging an extra surcharge for the evenings so expect a somewhat pricier dinner than you might be used to from a Max's.\n\nFor lunch, which is primarily when I go there (since I work in the area), I definitely recommend getting there at least 10 minutes before noon to beat the lunch crowd, especially during the holidays when afternoon performances of \"The Nutcracker\" are going on nearby and the restaurant is filled with families eating lunch prior to the show.\n\nOverall, it's one of the better places around the Civic Center area and worth a visit or two.

My visit last week was hands down one of the worst food experiences.\n\nFirst, let's talk staff. Or better yet, the lack of any caring staff. There was a wait (hmmm..wait till word gets out). We were then rushed..yes rushed..to a table by an older host gentleman who threw our menus on the table and then left.

When she came back, her greeting was \"And what do you want to eat?\" That should have been the sign to get out.  The burger I ordered was bland and not cooked to what I asked.

Gosh, terrible service and high ass prices.\n\nI went there around 9:15 on a Thurday night and they told us they were closing at 10:00 p.m. (they ended up staying open to way after that).  In any case, we were seated  on the Bar/Piano side about 12 feet away.  Big mistake!  The noise from the bar folks and the noise from the piano player made it hard to talk.  Also, the people eating near the bar were very very loud; subsequently, they had to yell to hear each other.  \n\nNext time, I'll go there for lunch like I have done at least 4 times before.  \n\nNow back to the service that night.  There was one lone young man talking orders and fetching the food for circa 25 people;    So herein that starts the problem with attentive  and timely service.  The water lady kept giving me water when I said no I don;t want anymore water.  She just was not listening.  The hot breads that showed up with the water were great.  \n\n I ordered the Broiled Salmon w/lemon Dijon sauce w/toasted capers, broccoli and smashed potatoes $19.99.  The salmon was cooked just right and had great flavor,   the broccoli was cooked Al dente like I like it, but it needed some type of light butter sauce on it or more seasoning and a light tossing of olive oil; however,  the  so-called smashed potatoes were terrible!!!  They were not entirely creamed and moist like they should be. Throughout the potato mound were here huge chunks of potatoes, so I got 1/3 chunks and 2/3 dry creamed potatoes.  Yuck.  The cooked must have been lazy.   \n\nNow comes the terrible service.  Not once did the server come back to our table to see if we needed something.  I wanted to flag him down, but he was so busy serving that it was hard to catch his eye.  Also, he did not notice that there was was a silent request for an extra beer and well as a silent request for our plates to be taken.  When a server sees an empty glass and the beer bottle at the edge of the table they are supposed to come by and see if the patron wants another one or clear them off the table.  When plates are on the edge of the table with the silverware in the 4:00 position, they are supposed to clear the plates.  None of that happened.   When we were finally able to catch his attention, we were almost finished with our food, (I left a large amount of the potatoes on my plate since they were so terrible). Amount 40 minutes into our meal, another woman was running food to the customers, but was not taking any orders, so our man was stretched thin.\n\nWe noticed that tons of people were walking about the are and were coming into the restaurant (I believe that the symphony or the opera just let out 'cause people were all dressed up.)  Also, circa  10:00 p.m. (when they were supposed to close), a huge party of about 25 people all dressed up came in and sat in the semi-private sunken banquet area.  The area does not have any sound-proof windows or partitions, just open partitions.  We were next to the people and it was so noisy that I was getting agitated and could not hear myself speak.  Luckily we were finished and got the check and out out of there.\n\n1 Star for overall service\n1 Star for the lumpy smashed potatoes\n1 Star for the waiter for not checking in with us at least 5-10 minutes after he left our food\n1 Star for Maxes for not staffing the restaurant properly and making the lone waiter bust his booty.\n1 Star for expensive prices for a diner type setting.\n1 Star for the noise in the Bar area\n1 Star for not putting up noise proof partitions in the open banquet area that is within 2 feet of the upper dining area.\n1 Star for the loud Piano noise", "author": "Vanilla C."}

I have such fond memories of eating here and basically gorging myself on too much of everything. HUGE portions make it easy to share and still not feel guilty about sharing a dessert too, which is heavenly. The wait staff take turns singing at the mic hamming it up, which is kind of the shtick of Max's \"Opera\" Cafe. You can't take it seriously, you have to stay light and breezy, and don't expect any kind of intimacy because it's loud, crowded and has a super \"busy\" feel.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-18", "description": "Unfortunately it appears as though there is new ownership at this location, and the patrons, kitchen and wait staff bear the brunt of the corners which are obviously being cut. The quality of the service and the food has gone way down in the past year, which is unfortunate because I used to adore Max's! \n\nI've loved going to Max's for over 15 years, both in SF and the former Walnut Creek location. I work directly across the street from the Van Ness location so I've frequented their deli counter quite often for lunch over the past 3 years. Unfortunately, however, the past couple of times that I've ordered in, seated at a table,  the wait staff has been overwhelmed, the orders were mixed up, and the food was not very good quality. For example:\n\nMay 2009 - I had dinner before the symphony with a group of about 5-6 people. I understand the restaurant was busy because of the groups of people going to the theater, but isn't that the reason for the location? Max's Opera cafe, next to the Opera house? Unfortunately, however, on a Saturday night they were way understaffed so the experience turned out to be downright painful.  I had ordered the Caesar salad with salmon, a $15.99 dish, not chump change for a salad. It came to the table after I had to wait while all of the other dishes were served, and it did not have any salmon. Or Parmesan cheese, or even dressing. It was a bowl of bare lettuce! The server somehow didn't even notice this (or maybe they were hoping I wouldn't). So when I brought this to the server's attention they responded with, \"Oh, yeah, we're pretty busy. I'll see what I can do\". After 15 minutes of waiting for them to come back, while everyone else around the table were finishing their meal, another server brought me a tiny little condiment dish of dressing to go with my bare lettuce. And still no salmon. Long story short, I clearly did  not get what I ordered, I was unable to finish my meal because it took so long to straighten it out, and the server didn't apologize or offer to take it off the bill! I couldn't even talk to the manager because apparently they were too busy calming down other irate customers. I was so shocked at how atrocious the experience was that I chose not to return for the better part of this past year.\n\nBut since time heals all wounds, and who knows if that was just a particularly off day, I decided to try it out one more time and give them a chance. So, just yesterday, I made one more effort to have lunch before going to see Wicked at the Orpheum with my sister. When we were seated, I had asked to start our meal with their famous cheesy garlic bread appetizer that I've adored since I was in high school. The server didn't know what I was talking about, and apparently they don't serve it anymore. This news broke my heart, it was an institution of Max's for as long as I can remember! If anyone is reading this review that works there, please push to bring it back!\n\nSo, instead of the bread, I asked for the Portabello mushroom appetizer, and specifically said we'd like it before our meal. Then my sister ordered a burger and I ordered a soup and salad. \n\nAnd a few minutes later, a new server delivered our food, but apparently they had forgotten to put the mushrooms in the system and our main dishes were brought out but there was no appetizer. And my Caesar salad didn't have the anchovies I ordered or the right dressing and the croutons were very hard and stale (I guess I just can't win with that dish!). So since by this point we had a new server (the original one was MIA), I went ahead and asked them to cancel the appetizer since we already got our meals and the kitchen hadn't started making the mushrooms so no harm no foul. But lo and behold, ten minutes later a THIRD server brought us the appetizer half way through our meal, even though I asked for it to be canceled. And we couldn't find our original server, and they charged us for the mushrooms even though we barely touched them through our meal.\n\nAll I can say is that I don't know what's going on with this location, maybe it's the stressed economy, but I'm not returning until I know that their service and management has improved significantly and the patrons can expect consistent quality. What an unfortunate turn of events to find out one of our favorite restaurants has gone so down hill. :(", "author": "Steenie K."}

It's a bright corner on Van Ness, with large windows facing the street and a lively atmosphere inside.  However, I have to say that the quality seems to have slipped, and on our last couple of visits, we found the food lacking.  First, the menu itself is much smaller.  Maybe the management wants to concentrate on the quality of fewer items, but the tastes don't seem to bear that out.  It also contradicts our expectations of delis with huge menus.  More to the point, their corned beef and pastrami, usually the signature ingredients of Jewish-style delis, were lacking.  The pastrami is apparently grilled, and the corned beef seemed like it came from a loaf of some kind.  Both meats just didn't have the flavors we savor, especially in a $13 sandwich.  Frankly, those meats are more flavorful at Tommy's Joynt up the street, and at half the price!  Perhaps the difference lies in the fact that Tommy's keeps those meats hot and moist on a steam table and hand carves them for each sandwich.  I hope that Max's will reconsider their approach to these sandwiches and entice us back again with an improved dining experience.", "author": "William L."}

When I do it myself the strength is perfect, the lemon and sweetness just right.  Instead of bread they serve, when requested, two warm rolls, one sourdough, one raisin.  Again, excellent.  Today I had the Chicken Caesar Wrap with Arugula Salad.  Their Caesar dressing may not be totally authentic (but whose is, nowadays), however I really like it. I especially enjoy the salads, crab cake appetizer and vegetable stuffed baked potato. The meal portions are just short of huge.  Every time I eat there I promise myself one of their yummy and huge desserts. Today, as always, I'm too full after my main course and can't even look at the dessert menu.  A few times I've gone there with friends just for dessert and have never been disappointed.  I do have one small complaint.  For some reason I've never been able to figure out the wait person almost always chooses to ask me how my meal is when my mouth is full and I can only nod my appreciation.  It's a small price to pay for an otherwise pleasurable dining experience.  I highly recommend Max's.", "author": "Sandra S."}

Not much has changed but for the added brunch...  at noon on a Sunday I was surprised 1) we found a parking space and 2) there was NO long line to get a table. The cute hostess wanted to seat me at a spot where I've previously been seated, and I asked for a booth as I didn't want each and every passing waitress/er bumping into the back of my chair. She understood right off and sat us by the big windows in a very roomy booth. It was about four minutes before we were waited on, and we ordered drinks and our brunch items...  I settle for a Vegetarian Spinach Fritta which came with country fries, and I added a chicken sausage which was one fat sausage cut in half and fried...  and was very meaty and big. It's a great helping sure to stuff you for a whole day....  for less than $16. The fritta looked almost like a messy spanish tortilla with big pieces of spinach, onions, zuchinni and even peas - hahahahahaa  - and I commented on that. Of course, a spanish tortilla is much better and very clean...  ;-)  This actually looked like a scrambled egg with veggies...\n\nI was disappointed when a family of three sat behind us and were waiting over 10minutes before our waiter noticed they were still not served anything. He stated a crew turnover had them sitting without service but he would be happy to take their order. We soon left and I estimate they had been sitting 20mins with a very active and hungry child....  I remarked to them that if it were me sitting there so long, I would have departed long ago with a few choice but courteous words to the shift manager. \n\nIn our not-recent last visits to this establishment, I have noticed that the waiters/resses seem preoccupied and would forget order items, refilling drinks, etc. This shouldn't be the experience one has at such a fine place as this but unfortunately, it seems to be happening more often now, as was a point in case the family waiting so long to order and to be served. It doesn't take but a minute to check on your clients and I know in a busy hectic environment such as a restaurant, things change from minute to minute.

And what was delivered was pretty substandard.  \n\nUsed to be they had a pretty good meatloaf - moist, and a nice sized portion with mashed potatoes and gravy.  But what came to the table was about the size of the meat on a small fast food burger, and pretty well dried out on top of it, with no gravy for the mashed potatoes or meatloaf. \n\nWe sat near the hostess' stand and asked \"what happened to Max's famous meatloaf?\".  The host said \"We changed that item and I like this a lot better\".  No attempt at \"I'll send your server over\" or \"I'll get you a new dish\" or anything to acknowledge there was a problem.\n\nThe mushroom fettuccine was a letdown also - a small portion and bland.\n\nThe good news is I can remove Max's from the list of potential restaurants for a casual night out.  \n\nThe sweet potato fries were good, and the portion was a nice size for two people, but that was the high point of the meal.

I've made it my life's mission to find the perfect Rueben Sandwich and Max's is the closest I've come.  But let's be honest here:  The evening service sucks.  \n\nThere is a long tradition of show biz people working in restaurants.  Singing wait staff is not difficult to find in San Francisco.  That said, these people are performers and could at least 'act' like they want to help you.  I tip 20%+ for exceptional service, 15% for standard.  We've only stiffed one person in the past ten years, and that was Max's waitress.  She was horrible.  She told us she would be back with our drinks and a busboy delivered water.  Fifteen minutes later a busboy came and took our order.  Okay...I've waited tables before...maybe she's on break?  Maybe they could tell us?  The place was busy, but it certainly wasn't slammed.   Then yet another busboy brought us our food.  She wandered back and forth past our table, yet didn't acknowledge us during the entire meal.  Never came up and asked us how we were doing and I had to track down a mustard caddy for my sandwich.  Finally she approached with our check while the dirty dishes congealed on the table, gave us a cursory nod, and wandered off.  That was it.  On a fifty dollar bill, she should have received a minimum of a $7.50 tip.  She got nothing.  She was there the second the money was in the billfold and stood there as we exited shooting daggers from her eyes.  I met her stare and I must say I was extremely angry with her.  If I'm paying $20 for a sandwich and a soft drink, I expect service.\n\nThis was not an isolated incident, merely the most severe one.  I've had some occasions where I've had the one seemingly good wait person in the evening and she was an absolute delight.  The lunch staff is a little more enthusiastic than the evening staff, and the evening staff is, by and large, under the impression that we need them more than they need us.\n\nAll of this aside, Max's food is typically very good.  I just don't recommend this particular location for the evening crowd.", "author": "Pikea M."}

Thus, I would think that you deduct the service charge from what you were going to tip anyways. But our party hit the minimum size for automatic tip service charge.\n\nFood was kind of blah... less than I remembered.

We live closer to many other restaurants that we would have chosen except for the fact that we had a coupon for $10 off dinner. The coupon's only parameters were that we spend over $20, the meal be after 5:00pm and only one discount per table. The coupon specifically listed two Max's locations which would honor the discount (one of which was this Van Ness location), and there was no expiration date.\n\nYou guessed it. We ate dinner (not cheap at nearly $90.00  with one kid's meal and one shared dessert ) and they said they were not going to honor the coupon. I pointed out that it had their specific location listed and that there was no expiration date. The waitress simply said, \"We're not part of that group anymore\". I said, \"are you sure this is how you want to treat your customers?\" She said \"You can use it somewhere else\". This after not being able to find her for a single coffee refill. \n\nSo Max, with all of your empty proclamations of \"The customer is always right\" etc on everything from napkins to banner boards hung on the wall, you would think that customer service would include honoring your own unexpired coupon, with your own address specified, and a photo of your own location's interior printed on its face. Sorry Max, you screwed up. You cost your waitress a tip, you cost yourselves goodwill, and irritated customers in the process.\n\nI guess the economy hasn't hit your restaurant to the point that you care about chasing away customers.\n\nThese fast slipping Yelp reviews actually make a difference to many of us....be careful or your customers will all go away.", "author": "T A."}

The waiters/waitresses often play live music, the food is tasty, and the selection of desserts is divine. However, the prices are a bit outrageous for what you get.  They have a tasty selection of Jewish delights as well which I enjoy, such as their Matzah Ball soup and their Blintzes.  Only complaint is the price, though, which keeps me from coming here too often. Sandwich + Drink + shared appetizer or side of soup will easily run you over $25 for lunch or so.", "author": "ben T."}

We were... well... kinda behind schedule, and needed to eat before we went to the Nutcracker (which was AMAZING, btw). So, in a super duper rush, we hurry into a much busier Max's than we've ever been to, where my grandparents had already talked to the host. He promised to get us out before our show (which was seriously like 45 minutes away), and BOOM... we were out, bellies happily full, with lots of time to spare. But it may have helped that we go to a Max's whenever we need to see my grandparents, so we already knew what we wanted... the service was still AWESOME. Oh, and the live music was a wicked plus, too. THANK YOU MAX'S AT THE OPERA FOR GETTING US TO OUR SHOW ON TIME!!!!!!!", "author": "Tavi H."}

Like a lot of the other reviews for this joint, I have to agree - why on Earth would one require servings so freaking huge?  Isn't the populace of our country fat enough as it is?  And talk about mediocrity ... a friend of mine called me once whilst I was sitting at the sad, forlorn bar with drunks, ex-junkies, and sad sacks, and said to me, \"That restaurant doesn't deserve you.\"  I can't speak for myself as to that claim, but I do have this to say:  Max's Opera Cafe is about as exciting and vibrant as a funeral home with a torch song soundtrack.  Some voices (the wait staff sing at night alongside a pianist) are worth listening to, but other times it can be downright painful.  Does anybody really need to listen to Frank Sinatra being transformed into a drag revue camp hit whilst eating?  The drinks are expensive, too.  But well made, I hastily add.  You need a stiff drink to dine in this diner/mausoleum.  If you must, order the turkey sliders - they're pretty damn good, if you can stomach the caterwauling.\r\n\r\nAlso, the letters to the owner posted next to the bathrooms are pretty funny to read.  Dennis (the owner, I think) makes comments on the letters expressing his point of view, and some of them are priceless.", "author": "Thomas B."}

I arrived before the dinner rush and came in through the side door. I was immediately seated and before I could fully pull my chair in a glass of water appeared at my table with some warm rolls and butter appearing shortly afterward.\n\nI ordered the New York Strip steak, medium rare with a salad, baked potato, creamed spinach, and iced tea to drink. The tea comes hot - they bring you two glasses with ice and a small metal pot of hot water with two tea bags steeping in it. Now that's the way to make sure the iced tea is fresh and not sour.  The steak was a bit more towards medium than rare with too much of the spice mix sprinkled on it (very salty), but it was tasty, and not dry. The good-sized salt-roasted potato came with plenty of butter and sour cream. The creamed spinach was also good - made with fresh spinach but alas a bit too rich for me. I couldn't finish it. The presentation of the food matched the decor, which was old-style but refined. Similar to what you might find in a higher end restaurant, but with some homey touches.\n\nI felt the service was above average as my server did check in on me from time to time with a good balance of leaving me alone, but noticing when things on the table needed a reset. All in all I enjoyed the experience and even though I was dining alone I wasn't rushed like what happens in some restaurants with single diners.\n\nThe price range is moderate to spendy. You can get simple fare and probably eat for $15-$20 per person, but there are more expensive options on the menu and it wouldn't be hard to run it up if you're also having drinks with your meal.", "author": "Blair B."}

I love the chicken matzo ball soup here.  When I'm sick, I'll definitely make a trip here to pick some up.\n\n2.  It is not possible for a human being to finish any one of their dishes since the portions are huge!  And honestly, it's to the point of being absolutely ridiculous if you don't come to eat here with your 30 closest friends.  Maybe they ought to look at half sizes?\n\n3.  Some dishes are good, but many times I've been disappointed.  This has made me wary to try much beyond some of the appetizers, the soup and the chicken salad sandwish.\n\n4.  The desserts are ridiculous in size, but the ultimate chocolate cake is a definite winner.  Yum!  Again, due to portion sizes, if you eat a meal, you probably won't be able to do dessert.

When I asked the waitstaff what type of greens they used in their dinner salad, she sighed(HEAVILY) and said,\"Well,\" \"since it is SALAD,\" \"It would be safe to assume it's lettuce!!\" Then, turning on her heels and dismissing us, altogether, she stomped away. We were then left to sit there for 10 more minutes before she returned. When she did(return) she looked at me and said, \"What will you be having?,\" intoning not to ask anymore questions. At this point I was livid. So I quipped, \"Well,\" \"If I knew if there was arugala in the damn salad,\" I may have ordered that with a bowl of soup.\" \"However,\" \"We've decided to luncheon elsewhere.\" BAD SERVICE.

That's not to say that the kitchen doesn't have the diet-conscious in mind. Whether on Atkins or South Beach, those watching their food intake can enjoy a number of items on a carb-conscious menu. Everyone else can indulge in the likes of tender, meaty barbecued spareribs in a tangy sauce, brisket of beef in a honey-caraway gravy, or linguini tossed with portabello mushrooms, roasted garlic, fresh herbs, and extra virgin olive oil. Corned beef and pastrami sandwiches have just the right amount of fat and are as good as any found in New York City. French fries are crisp and relatively grease-free. Even the iced tea is special here - you allow it to brew to the preferred strength in a small pot before pouring it into a tall glass. And when you request a refill, you'll get new tea bags, not just hot water to add to those you've already used. Desserts are sinfully rich and large enough to be enjoyed by two . . . or three. The gimmick that differentiates this Max's from others in the chain are the servers singing operatic arias and Broadway show tunes. Don't be surprised if the waitress who just served your Caesar salad is now in the spotlight belting a la Merman. A word of warning: avoid a table close to the small stage. When the staff isn't singing, a pianist is tinkling the keys, and conversation can be difficult.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

It was getting later and things were closing. Then I remembered hearing about this Max's place not too far from where we were. I am from the East Coast and have had my fill at the NJ/NY/Philly delis and have never been disappointed. I was curious to see if this place could satisfy as well.\r\n\r\nABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!\r\n\r\nThe server was perhaps the worst I have ever had. She didn't listen to a word any of us said. My girlfriend asked for a lemon slice for her water three times and the waitress still didn't bring it after 20 minutes, so I went to the the back and found her and kindly asked her for it. She apologized but kept up her goofy grin. Then we ordered and got our food. I ordered the brisket, which was dry and bland, joined by practically raw broccoli and a latke that was basically IHOP hashbrowns in circular form. Disgusting, and the portions were not anywhere near the sizes on the East Coast and way more expensive too. My girlfriend got a burger with avocado, which of course the waitress forgot. She dropped the food off then walked away. We waited about ten minutes then I had to go to the back to find her again and remind her. We ate and when she came to check on us and ask how the food was, I said it was ehhhh, and she said, \"Great!\" smiling the whole time. She didn't listen at all. Then we had to wait another 20 minutes for the bill after we had finished. \r\n\r\nSo moral is, the food was mediocre at best and definitely not worth the price and the service was downright terrible. I would never go to this place again and would not recommend it to anyone.", "author": "Saikat P."}

Well, for the last few times, we realized the quality of food is no longer as good as before. Tonight was the last straw: The glass of water had a lipstick mark on it.  We asked the waiter to change it.  It came back with a piece of disgusting hair stuck on the rim.  They always bring a basket of bread as you get there. We had to ask for it and first we were given two pieces on a platter for 3 people and then they realized they had not brought out the usual bread basket.  But the most disgusting thing that caused us to decide not to go to Max's ever again was the piece of hair that I found in my Reuben sandwich.  It was so mingled with the sour kraut!  eek... totally lost my appetite but did not want to ruin it for the others on my table and did not make a scene out of it.  After I came home tonight and read all the reviews, I realized that we are not the only ones feeling the downhill situation of Max's in terms of quality and service.  You wouldn't expect such bad quality and carelessness from Max's considering the prices you pay.

It seems as though they are going through some changes and not everyone is on the same page.\n\nThe food used to be great!  I used to be a regular there.  As time passed and David Berkowitz (original owner) left the picture of the Opera Plaza location things have gone down hill.  It seems that the new owners want only to make a buck no matter how fast they rush you out of there.  Quality of the stay is not on the agenda.  \n\nOn a busy show night (Symphony, Herbst Theatre, Museum) you could wait to be seated for an hour or longer.  Management or the hostess just keep taking names and do not really show much concern about what time your show starts.  If I had any investment in this company; I would be a little more concerned with the people waiting in the restaurant.  If management does not know how to seat in a timely fashion then maybe they should have a host or hostess that has experience in that department. \n\nGARRETT!!!!!!!  WHERE ARE YOU?\nAnd what happened to Garret?!!!!  Where the heck is he?  On Sundays he had a couple of old ladies that would come in for him and I just wonder how they now feel that he is gone.  He had to be one of the best servers in there.  He was on top of his game, he played the piano during the day which for the most part was unheard of.  The schedule says that the piano playing and singing begin at 6:30 p.m.  Garrett would play during the lunch hour made for a pleasant visit.  That gentleman had been there for a while at least as long as I had been enjoying the food 3 years or more.  Management, owners drove him out?  THAT WAS A BIG MISTAKE!!!!!!!  Bring back the quality and maybe you guys might get back those old customers(I DOUBT IT THOUGH).  As for now the place sucks the food is mediocre, and the management needs new training!  Servers that have been there a while know much more than what the management seems to know.  Emily seems to be giving the general manger pointers on things and doing a better job at it.  Why not put some of those servers into a position to help the current owners and or managers achieve greatness once again?  Oh yeah and maybe a manager standing up at the hostess stand should crack a SMILE once in a while;  it make the wait much more pleasant!!!  \n\nThere is a manager there that seemed to be the only one who could keep it together her name was Didit.  She was very low-key and it seemed that no matter what the problem she could take care of it quietly without making it into an ordeal.  Another manager Rosie, thought she was just a hostess?  She does not smile and mingles with her employees (the servers) too much during a shift.  She does not seem to have enough to do.  Put her at the hostess station seems that she was a server in that restaurant and has not had any other job in her life so the story goes.  \n\nAll and all the Reuben is to die for and the Philly Cheese Steak as well, but do not order anything else.  It is like they are trying to plate food that is being catered and it is not!  They are not up to that standard.  IT'S A CAFE FOR GOODNESS SAKES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I dare you to venture at your own risk as the quality goes down more and more each day.  Max's had something really good going there.  They really should thank the State Department across the street that will keep them in business.  \n\nThe meatloaf in the photo is not homemade contrary to popular belief it looks like a processed piece of meat.
