The first one we wanted to get it from had a line out the door.  It was probably due to the Moon Festival street fair going one.  \n\nWe decided to get it from Yummy Bakery and Cafe.  No line.  Able to buy my egg tarts and eat it immediately. The egg tarts were hot from the heated unit.  The crust was flakey and crisp.  The egg custard was a good texture. Stiff, but creamy when bitten into. More like a custard pie texture than firm texture.  The custard was also not too sweet, which can be a problem.   \n\nOverall a very good egg tart and without the long wait.", "author": "Marck N."}

Decided to ask what it was and hit the jackpot - Pandan sponge cake. The lady then pointed us to this small bakery on Jackson street.\nIt was a pleasant surprise to find this gem. They not only served traditional Chinese baked goods. They also make more creative baked goods such as pandan sponge cake, egg white egg tart, etc.\nThe pandan sponge cake smelled good, had great pandan leaf flavor, and was so soft. It melts in our mouth. Unfortunately,  we could only get one (the last one for the day - it sold out just after lunch hours).\nWe also love the egg white egg tarts. They are as good (or better) than their regular egg tarts but not as sweet. It is option for more health conscious or calories counting customers. \nDefinitely worth exploring more in the future.", "author": "Andrew L."}

There are times when they brought me assorted pastries and treats from here. And every single items they have brought me were incredible and not like any other pastry than any Chinese bakery. \n\nAmong the bakery's tasty treats are the custard tarts in both regular and egg white version. If Golden Gate Bakery, located up the hill and also known for their egg tarts is closed, the tarts and other treats also goes really fast from here.   \n\nMy latest visit was to check out the bakery's version of the hot dog bun. For $1.50, the bread is a cheesy flavor. Not many bakeries make the bread with the intense cheese flavor. And the bread level is just right and not over excessive. This treat may not be attractive, but the hot dog bun from here is one of the better tasting treat I have had in a long time. \n\nI also brought a couple more and take home and put those bad boys in the oven. The toasted bread tasted like an Asiago bagel. And the hot dog was grilled nicely. Either way you do it, the hot dog bun is legit. \n\nThere are many Chinese bakeries in Chinatown and throughout the city and Bay Area. My colleagues were dead on.

Unlike other places it is mainly a bakery without a separate Caf\u00e9 section. My first visit to Yummy Bakery and Caf\u00e9 was a couple of months ago when I was doing the rounds of all the bakeries in Chinatown to find a replacement for Golden Gate as I had no intention of standing in line for 45 minutes to get egg tarts and that too when they are not on vacation.\n\nI decided to get my standard order of 3 egg tarts. I was told that if I bought 4 I could get a box so I got 4. I also got a hot dog bun. The egg tarts had the flaky/crunchy crust like Golden Gate and were placed in a heated case. They seemed to have been sitting there for some time as they felt a little dry and dehydrated. They were not bad just not as good as AA Bakery's which I preferred over these. The hot dog bun was also not fresh. \n\nPrice wise the egg tarts were about $1.50 a pop which still makes then about 20% cheaper than Golden Gate but almost 35% more expensive than AA Bakery. Overall this is not a bad bakery. It's just that it is up against so much competition which is a lot better than it.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

I come here just for the egg custard tart. They offer an all egg white version for those fearful of yolks. Personally I like the regular, \"yellow egg tart\" more. Almost as good as Golden Gate's, but GG's dan tat is still the one to beat. Price has steadily gone up though still more affordable than Golden Gate's. Definitely good enough to satisfy the palate when GG is not open. These are getting popular so they often sell out by 4pm.", "author": "Lil D."}

Of course, once I reached GGB, they were closed (thanks for the heads-up, Yelpers!).  Ok, no problem, turned around and visited YBC.  Tried several of YBC's items:\n\n1.  Pineapple BBQ Pork bun.  4 stars, no gristle or fat.\n2.  Ham and cheese bun.  4 stars.\n3.  Coconut cake.  3 stars, there were only two left, so not right out of the oven.\n4.  Almond cookie.  4 stars, taste good but not overly sweet.\n\nThe chinese woman who helped us was polite and smiling, and while we were eating our treats at one of the small tables, the bakers brought in 3 or 4 different items to replenish the stock on display.  I noticed later that they also serve Egg Tarts (not on display, but from a sign on the wall) which I will try next time.  I assume they make their Egg Tarts fresh to compete with GGB.\n\nMinus one star for the coffee/liquid splashes on the wall next to the dine-in tables, it was really dirty.  My suggestion to YBC is to take some 409 cleaner and wipe down the walls once or twice a year next to the tables where people eat.  Those stains look like they have been building up for years.", "author": "Shawn S."}

The cafe part is a stretch since there are three small tables against the wall. The display case is what you'll spend time perusing before purchase, and since most of the items are $1.10, gluttony is a constant threat.\n\nNothing is terribly exceptional like the Egg-Custard Tarts at Golden Gate Bakery, but they provide the perfect steamed chicken chaser if you are so inclined.

We like their egg white tarts in flaky shells as not too many places have it. And they don't make it too sweet just as we like. We liked their selections and service was great in begining when they first opened. They occassionally and selectively give out discount around evening time to some frequently visited customers (or if you are lucky) to get rid of some buns or to give away some buns just coz. But once we came around evening times, not to mention no discount when I asked even though I purchased a lot, they didn't have too great of an attitude towards us and stressed the point they never give out any discount or buns (which we know it is not true).  But what got me upset was I recently went back again and asked for 6 buns and I found there were only 3 buns in the bag when I got home. Obviously, the girl misunderstood me even though I spoke loud and clear in Chinese.  That time, I had to walk up and down the hills of Chinatown in heels to look for that place and I didnt' plan to just buy 3 buns. It really wasted my time and efforts.

When I said\" Wow that's not cheap!!, the young lady replied \" But you're paying for the 2\"...Thanks dumb...I can do the math , it's still $2.50 for a small freakin' tart...I expect to pay that price at the Ferry Building, which make sense, but here no...\nThey didn't even have their price on the  goods they sold us..while all the others baked goods were at the top $1.00 a piece..They're a freaking small chinatown bakery...Place at the Ferry Building have better stuff for the same amount or less...\nI know I should have say 'no thanks! bye..'..What they sell is not even great,  just barely o.k...\nSave yourself a trip for that price, just go to a real french bakery, you'll probably pay almost the same price, but at least it will be yummy and taste like real pastries....not sponges.", "author": "luna s."}

I was there 5ish... wanted to buy more than a dozen egg white tart for family... they only had 13 for me... the owner was so nice, treated me to one of his product-- birdnest egg tart. He said he will  start selling them in a few days. I tried it and love it too! Will go back to get both the egg white tart and the bird nest egg tart next time!  They have great customer service, very friendly people. Price is very reasonable. It looks very clean and well lit compare to many bakeries in Chinatown. (since they have only been opened for 6 months)They have a lot of interesting pastries, such as coffee walnut roll.  Make sure you try this bakery (esp  when Golden Gate Bakery is always closed, this is a very good alternative when they are closed or if you just simple don't want to stand in line!)", "author": "sam l."}
