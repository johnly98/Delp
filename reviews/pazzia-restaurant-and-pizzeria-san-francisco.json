It is not easy to find good authentic Italian food in the states, but luckily, in San Francisco we have Pazzia!\n\nBread and Olive Oil (4.5/5): What can I say about this AMAZING bread? I could go to Pazzia, eat just the bread, leave and I would still feel satisfied!\n\nTagliere di Salumi (2/5): For the many times I have been to Pazzia, I can say that this is probably their biggest miss. In Italian restaurants, we like to start with a big plate of salumi. Those few stripes of speak (a kind of salumi that you should not see in a tagliere) and two micropieces of prosciutto make this a sad plate.\n\nGuazzetto (4.5/5): This is FANTASTIC. The taste of the sauce is so balanced with the taste of the mussels and the spiciness is just at the right level, really a must order.\n\nLasagna (4/5): The serving of this lasagna is beautiful, and the taste of the meat is so authentic. Can't go wrong with this, I think anybody that can eat meat would like it.\n\nOverall Rating (4/5):\nPazzia easily gets a solid four stars, and it is surely one of the places I always like to go. If they improve their salumi plate, they could really step up their game.", "author": "Manuel T."}

I think its a great place to go for dinner on a date or with a small group of friends. I do not think its a great place to have lunch at, the reason being its tooo crowded and the service is soooooo slow and the food feels rushed! I came here with a group of coworkers (party of 10) We got seated immediately without a reservations, score! *fist pump*. Things were going well until the lunch rush arrived. It took forever for our servers to come take our order or even serve bread for our table (which we didn't get refills on). food took forever to come out, and some parts of my pasta was clumped together and wasn't even cooked thoroughly. Aside from my opinion (I have higher food expectations) all my coworkers seem to have really enjoyed their meals.\n\nI'm giving a 4 star review b/c I have also dined here for dinner and it was perfect! there weren't a lot of people around we got quick service and the food was delicious!

It's in an oval dish and actually not as thick as normal lasagna. There are only 2 layers at most and the cheese is much more liquid and not too hardened.

Unlike other Italian restaurants I've been to, portions aren't ridiculously sized, so order enough to be full. I got the taglierini, which consists of spinach pasta and salmon, and it was pretty good. Salmon was cooked well and the pasta was on the lighter side since it wasn't heavily drenched in sauce.

We called about 30 minutes ahead of time, and they insisted that there would probably be no wait for a party of 2. When we got there, it was nearly full, but they were super accommodating and managed to grab us a table right away.\n\nFirst impression: This place hit all the right notes for me. The ambiance was intimate, comfortable, and classy--the decor boasted romantic (read: dim) lighting, warm toned furniture, and an open kitchen. We were served some delicious bread as soon as we were seated, and I'm not proud to admit that we consumed two basketfuls of bread. (+1 for the bread because it was that good LOL)\n\nWhat We Ordered:\n\n1) Caprese Salad (4/5): To be honest, I'm not the biggest fan of tomatoes (in fact, you could almost say I hate them) but the flavors of the mozzarella and basil balanced out the tomatoes so well that I didn't even mind! Great appetizer, and a good light start to a probably heavier rest of the meal. \n\n2) Mushroom & Sausage Pizza (4/5): This definitely satisfied my cravings for pizza! It was huuuge we were only able to finish half and we took the rest home. It was a little bit too cheesy, so the pizza itself felt very oily and wet but honestly it still tasted pretty amazing. \n\n3) Gnocchi (5/5): Tasted like literal pillows in my mouth. Sauce was on point, the actual gnocchi was amazing, could not ask for more!\n\n4) Tiramisu (5/5): My second stomach for dessert prompted us to order the tiramisu, and I definitely did not regret it. It was delightful! It melted in my mouth so easily, and it wasn't too sweet which is a problem I usually have with Tiramisu. Coffee lovers, definitely try this one!\n\nService: Our waiter was polite and attentive, always checking up on us and kindly not judging how much bread I ate. \n\nOverall, definitely coming back here!

After just recently moving back to the Bay, I started craving Italian food and Pazzia in particular - and after a seven year hiatus - it was just as good (if not better!) than I remembered! Woo hoo!\n\nMy all time favorite lasagna spot (Macelleria in NYC) closed a while ago and I had yet to find a suitable replacement. Enter Pazzia. I remember the visits in my earlier days when a coworker would only ever get the lasagna and never share! I knew this needed to be given a chance as the new de facto lasagna.\n\nLo and behold - we were not disappointed! After much debate, we decided to each get an order of their lasagna because hubby and I were equally worried that if we liked the lasagna as much as we hoped we would - there would be no sharing. Thankfully, we rolled the dice appropriately because this is not a shareable entree. You'll want to eat it all yourself. The bolognese is perfectly meaty, cheesy, tomato-y, creamy, everything-y.\n\nNow, it's not all about the lasagna...which I've clearly mentioned plenty of times now....\n\n1. They are expanding into the space next door and hope to open by September which will more than double their space.\n2. Owner Massimo is still in charge and seemingly at the restaurant every night greeting patrons, saying goodbye, helping the wait staff, in the kitchen, everything. It's a great touch.\n3. The restaurant was renovated since I'd been last and I love the new look. They did away with the 90s style white tablecloths and decor and have a more updated + modern look going on.\n4. Their focaccia is AMAZING. You've been warned.\n5. Great + reasonably priced wine list including by-the-glass options.\n6.

For those of you who haven't met this guy yet, well you should because he's a super cool dude who's turning out some authentic pastas and classic Italian dishes. Oh and get this, he's from Italy too!\n\nI ordered the caprese salad to start because it's the end of tomato season here in CA so wanted to take full advantage. I forgot to take a picture because I was pretty darn hungry but, the salad was well proportioned and the tomatoes, mozzerella and basil were as fresh as can be. I was feeling like fish that afternoon and normally don't order salmon but, for some reason it was calling my name that afternoon. I was surprised to see such a nicely sized piece of fish for a lunchtime portion and it was cooked/seasoned perfectly. The accompanying potatoes and vegtables felt nice and healthy too. \n\nAll in all, it's a great option for those of you who want to keep it casual and not break the bank during the week. There were a couple large groups dining at the same time so, if you're thinking \"team lunch\", this might be a good option. Grazie Mossimio, grazie!", "author": "Benjamin F."}

Having tried more of their menu over subsequent visits, I'll say this: their pastas and pizzas are all solid options, which has easily made Pazzia one of my go-to pasta stops in the city, alongside Zero Zero for something a bit fancier and unique, and Caffe Macaroni for something a bit more central and varied.\n\nMy feelings about their lasagna haven't changed: it's still delicious, and one of the things I frequently get, but their other pastas are also quite tasty as well. They used to have separate menus for this, but have since combined them such that the handful of handmade pastas have their own section on the main menu now.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - When they're busy, the inside of the restaurant can get a little packed, but I've rarely had trouble with seating when I go.

The food was exceptionally tasty. I'm not giving them 5 stars though because unfortunately there was an earwig (pincher bug) in my boyfriends pasta, yuck. The reason I'm still giving them 4 stars though is because they handled the situation in such a professional manner. They were visibly sorry.m, they apologized profusely and told me it had never happed before and the critter must have snuck into the mushrooms which would be hard to spot when cleaning and preparing them.

The fresh, free bread here is AMAZING. It is ooey-gooey-chewy and you KNOW it's fresh and handmade with love. I could it ALL DAY with nothing on it!\n\n2. The Fritto Mixto is not your typical calamari, but it is fluffy and light and not too filling! Definitely worth a try.\n\n3.

While my friends got stiffed by some \"fancy pasta\" and some \"delicious tortellini\", it ended up being a tiny serving of lasagna and about 6 pieces of tortellini. Shared between multiple, growing, hungry teenageers/young adults.\n\nHowever, my meal was the pizza. Honestly, they all looked pretty similar so I ended up getting one with sausage and mushroom. Not bad -- I've had worse but I've definitely had better. The food took about 40 minutes to arrive, so not ideal either, but we were quite hungry by the time so the pizza tasted pretty good at that point. \n\nIt's a tiny restaurant, so you might have to deal with sitting outside. And you might have to wait a good 30 minutes for seating regardless (unless you have a reservation). It wasn't too bad, but I definitely got a couple mosquito bites that busy summer night I went.

I wasn't expecting a lot, but the experience didn't match the minimal standards I held for an off-the-cuff lunch in downtown San Francisco. \n\nFor starters, it was an uncharacteristically beautiful, warm summer day in San Francisco. There was no patio seating available, which would have been fine if it weren't also unbearably warm inside. For whatever reason there was no air conditioning and the otherwise empty interior reflected that. We sat at the table closest to the door, just short of sweating, and proceeded to order. \n\nThe salad was quite decent, with a good mix of flavors and fresh ingredients. Unfortunately my pizza was a little undercooked. Far worse though was the hair I found under one slice. Rather than make a scene about it, I chose to carefully eat around that slice. Was this an actual hair or just some random lint that had flown into the dish on the way to our table? I didn't want to investigate. \n\nOur server was extremely nice and I consider the hair a one-off irregularity that wouldn't deter me from eating here. The uncomfortably warm interior without air conditioning is a deal-breaker though, and enough to keep me from recommending or making a return visit.", "author": "Alex L."}

We stayed at the W hotel and had a long day wandering the Golden Gate Park, California Academy of Sciences and de Young Museum. We were forced to eat at the cafe at the California Academy of Sciences for lunch due to accessibility of food. For dinner, we wanted to eat somewhere close by but with great food, since we were disappointed by our lunch fare. \n\nWe decided to look to Yelp for a restaurant that was nearby and we were craving Italian food. At first we were disappointed since all the reviews said that this restaurant was closed for remodeling but we decided to call to double check. Low and behold, we were saved! We were told they were open until 10:30 PM so we got ready and walked down the street to the restaurant.\n\nUpon first impression, I loved the feel of the restaurant. It was warm and inviting, like you were visiting home. There wasn't seating available for us inside but we decided to take advantage of the beautiful weather and enjoy our meal outside. \n\nWe were warmly greeted by our waiter who was very friendly and he took our drink orders and food order since we knew what we wanted. I enjoyed the house white wine while my boyfriend ordered La Rossa Double Bock beer. The house bread was very good, with a nice crust on the outside and white, hot, fluffy bread inside, accompanied with olive oil for dipping. \n\nOur food came and we were both very impressed. I ordered the seafood risotto and my boyfriend ordered the tagellini. Both dishes were slightly out of our comfort zone and we both enjoyed our food. The seafood risotto had a wonderful fragrance to it, it wasn't fishy-smelling at all and the seafood was cooked to perfection! Definitely a great ratio of risotto to seafood, and the risotto was perfectly cooked as well. \n\nWe ended our dinner with a tiramisu to change our palate. It was very moist and light, which is what I want in a great tiramisu. \n\nOnly downside I experienced while I was at this restaurant was the service at the very end. It took a very long time for our waiter to come by our table to give us our bill and even take our bill when we had a card in place. Part of it was us sitting outside but there was a significant period of time where our waiter was standing on the restaurant floor observing the patrons. So for that, I reduced the rating to 4 stars. Regardless, it was a great experience and at the end the owner even asked us how we enjoyed our meal. Although I didn't interact with the owner much, I saw him helping his staff and greeting customers, which I thought was great. \n\nHighly recommend this restaurant for decently priced Italian fare in the SoMa district.", "author": "Sabrina R."}

Pazzia got rave reviews, and the pics looked good, plus who doesn't love Italian?  I'm glad that they're expanding their space to the empty portion nextdoor, because the restaurant is small and we took up a table in the middle for 9 of us.  This place is definitely busy during lunch and we had to wait a little while for our order to be taken.  \n\nIt was definitely a hard choice, but the waitress sold me on one of the specials which was a saffron pasta.  We started off with some orders of the burratta.  You can never go wrong with burrata with proscuitto!  The cheese was nice and creamy, the argula was the perfect bitter balance and the pork was fresh and just added a tad of the saltiness.  I think the buratta could have used a little more seasoning though.  My saffron pasta came with lots of shrimp and zucchini and tons of homemade pasta.  Pasta was cooked al dente, the zucchini was delish.  I loved the color of my sauce, but wish the saffron taste stood out more.  I think it would have been great if there was a little more in the pasta, like maybe some crab or scallop, or some extra veggies.  Everyone else seemed to like their pasta, pizza and calzone.  The calzone was massive and had lots of meat and an egg in it.  \n\nI think Pazzia is a decent place to get your carb fix on in SOMA.  It's slightly pricey, but it's understood to the area.

We had the Caprese as an appetizer, then for the main dish the gf had Pennette Ai Funghi and I had the Pizza Del Giorno.

But, on the upside, the owner was very gracious and came by to introduce himself, even offered a drink (unfortunately I don't really drink all that often due to my training), and thanked all the diners for stopping by, which I think was very classy and made the experience personable. \n\n4.) The layout, its small (a little tight, you do hear everything the other diners are saying) with a direct view of the kitchen, but with a nice modern decor.  The roses and candles inside was definitely an added bonus for Valentine's Day.  You can tell the owner really put some thought into keeping the restaurant looking top notch!\n\nOverall, we had a great experience and would definitely come back!!", "author": "Mike M."}

However, I will summarize my thoughts:\n\nFood has always been superb. Pizzas are great, homemade Pastas are to dream about and the appetizers are mouth watering.\n\nService has always been fast and cordial. Vanna, our waitress, has always been fun and entertaining, without taking anything away from her professionalism.\n\nThe owner, Massimo, always welcomes me and my friend with open arms. As if we were childhood friends that haven't seen each other in years. However, it's usually a week at most.\n\nThey really make you feel at home here. And food is great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-25", "description": "DISCLAIMER - DO NOT OPEN THIS REVIEW IF YOU GET GROSSED OUT EASILY! \n\nSo me and a couple of friends decided to check this place out since it was right around the corner from the bar that we were at. As soon as we got seated we got our menus. My friends and I were taking a while to decide what to get since we had never been here before. Within the first 2-3 minutes I expected for our waitress to come to our table and ask us if we wanted anything to drink (you know, how it's supposed to be) or at least check on us to see if we had any questions about the menu, but she didn't. I noticed a couple that walked in, got seated at a timely manner and got some water right away (before us) which made me very upset. Finally after about 10min of deciding over what to order (mind I say, my friends and I had to YELP the restaurant to see what was good) we were finally ready. We put our menus down hoping our waitress would come but one of my friends had to actually give her a hand signal and call her over. Unbelievable. FINALLY our waitress came to our table and took our order. Clearly there was nothing special about her or her personality that made me feel welcome at this restaurant. In my opinion, a waitresses main priority should be to make the customers feel welcomed and have a fun personality so we can feel comfortable. customer service wise; I asked my friends what they thought and one responded with \"The service was ok. They didn't really check up on us\" and another said \"They did take a while but they were also busy\" .. I'm huge on customer service and I rate this place a 1 out of 5. \n\nNow for the food.. Four of us got pastas and 1 of us got a lasagna. I must say the food was just off the charts and my friends were pretty impressed. We all loved our plates, they were delicious. I ordered a sea food pasta. It had clams, shrimp, octopus and calamari. I don't really have much to say about the food besides the fact that it was pretty damn good! We were all 100% satisfied. \n\nNow here is the reason why I am writing this review... THIS WILL BE VERY DETAILED SO PLEASE STOP READING THIS IF THIS IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION FOR YOU. Please note: I limit myself to only eating out ONCE a week (since I do like to eat healthy) meaning this restaurant was the ONLY place I went \"out\" to eat to. \n\nSo.. the next day in the morning after having dinner at this restaurant, I digested something unusual... let me rewind a little. After dinner, my friends and I went out and I ended up getting home at 3AM. As soon as I got home, I digested (I seem to have a very fast metabolism) and right after, I went to sleep. I woke up at 9am because my stomach was aching and sure enough, I had to digest for the second time which was totally normal for me. I went back to sleep and woke up at around 11:30 and what do you know?? I digested for the third time. Once I got up to flush, I noticed something VERY SCARY in my stool. I was so scared I called my grandma in the restroom and we thought it was a tapeworm. It looked long, wide and off white. She grabbed a wooden pencil, took it out of the toilet, placed it under the faucet and washed it off. I HAD EATEN A PIECE OF GLOVE! It was literally a whole finger of a glove.\n\nSo many things were running through my head. I knew it was from the restaurant, I just couldn't figure out HOW I HAD SWALLOWED THAT THING. I came to the conclusion that since I would roll up my pasta on the fork, the piece had to have gotten in there somehow; since it was actually longer than it looks in the picture. I've also came to the conclusion that I probably chewed it up thinking it was some piece of clam or calamari. I'm sure the glove would've had a similar texture as the chewy sea food. EITHER WAY, I'm 100% sure that this piece of glove came from this restaurant because (once again) THIS WAS THE ONLY PLACE I HAD EATEN OUT DURING THE WEEK. Also, the week before this, I had eaten wingstop which is dry food so I know it couldn't have been from there. \n\nSo I decided to call the restaurant. When I called, the first question I asked was if they used gloves to prepare their food and the woman on the phone said yes. I asked her to describe them to me ... after she did, I told her what happened. She then began to say it was impossible and was all she kept on saying. She was going on and on and then said it was ALSO impossible because the cooks didn't use gloves to prepare the pasta... Excuse me, didn't you JUST tell me that the cooks use gloves to prepare the food? She was just being rude, so I cut her off. I told her I wasn't calling to argue or get anything out of them and that I just wanted to let them know so they could be more cautious.  \n\nI just wish they would've handled the situation properly. I don't get why the woman had to freak out over the phone? So I guess for everyone who visits this place in the future, PLEASE CHECK YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU EAT IT. GOOD LUCK!! \n\nP.S. \nPazzia, you're lucky I'm not suing.", "author": "Emily O."}

Sooo good. I wanted more even though I was so full already. The meat was cooked perfectly and the tomato sauce was not too salty (thankfully).

Upon coming in, all of the staff was very friendly and personable in greeting us and making sure our party was properly situated. The indoor seating was INCREDIBLY HOT to the point where my co-workers and I were frantically fanning ourselves to suppress the impending hurricane of sweat we were producing. When we asked to sit outside, they set up a table for us and allowed us to enjoy the breezy 70 degree evening weather. \n\nThe food was especially tasty... although it probably had a stick of butter in each dish. \"TREATCHO SELF, STEPHEN\" was my mantra through every bite of delicious lasagna, pizza, tortelloni, gnocci, and pappardelle that I inhaled. The pasta all went really well with a nice glass of red and honestly tasted better than a lot of food I've tried in Italy. \n\nI've heard the tiramisu is pretty bomb here, so I'll most likely return for another post-work excursion soon.

Everything we ate was super-fresh and beautiful, and as soon as I'm back in SF, I'll do it all over again. \n\nThings change when you have a baby. Suddenly your Yelp searches for dinner include the term, \"family friendly\" and you make reservations for three with a request for floor space (that damn stroller). Pazzia was happy to make us comfortable, and the gentleman running the place even helped my husband lift the damn stroller over the heads of other diners to get us into a quiet, low-traffic corner of the place. Such service. \n\nOur meal? Spectacular. The burratta was incredibly fresh and creamy, served with a beautiful side of dressed arugula and thinly-sliced and deliciously salty prosciutto. The Pazzia salad was simple, yet packed with beautiful ingredients and amazing flavors. These two apps were the perfect precursor to our decadent pastas -- mine being the Ravioli with Mushrooms in Pink Sauce, a divinely salty, creamy and earthy mix, and his the Beef Tortelloni with Cream Sauce & Mushrooms, another home-run. Accompanied by a glass or two of bold, juicy local cabernet, our meal was a total pleasure. \n\nThe service is impeccable. Warm, quick, helpful -- the server even suggested a different wine to complement my husband's meal when he ordered, and she was totally spot on.

I pass by it often since it's in a great location - easy to get to on foot or by public transit, and near Caltrain. However, I was kinda disappointed in the end. I went with my bf on a Friday, after the dinner rush. There was no line, which was great - why then, did we have to wait so long before being seated then served? The restaurant wasn't even busy. The waitress we had was nice, but it was sometimes difficult to get her attention... or anyone else's for that matter - even the owner, who was distracted by a dog at another table (indoors, which was unusual for a restaurant). The food was okay, but I've definitely had better Italian food in SF. The starter meat platter we shared was good, but nothing special. Similar for the lasagne - it was okay, but was more overcooked than expected. We didn't bother staying for dessert.

While this was probably one of the better items on the menu, there are plenty of other places in the city that can serve up a mean Margherita at the same price.\n\n- Gnocchi: Too dense. Tomato-based sauce was tasty though and just the sauce itself was a great dip to make up for the pizza crust.\n\n- Bread: Decent; soft and warm. Needed some salt or perhaps some balsamic vinegar to serve with it.\n\nThe atmosphere is just okay too. It was strange that they were playing loud electronic music at an Italian white tablecloth restaurant. It seemed like it was easy to snag a spot and wasn't terribly busy around 6pm.", "author": "Joanne Y."}

Finally dropped by and it was a pleasant experience involving some pretty great Italian food. My friend and I came in at 6:30 on a weekday and the place was still fairly empty, but by 7pm the place was packed, so I'd recommend coming by earlier (or making a reservation).\n\nThe food is really great! As any good Italian place will do, they start off with bread, which is hot out of the oven and tastes fantastic. It's served with olive oil that tastes better than normal. I went with a pasta and got the Taglierini Verdi (spinach pasta, salmon, pancetta, olives). The pasta is perfectly al dente, chewy and soft, just the way it should be. The salmon was fresh and cooked well. Everything tasted amazing, though it was a little on the oily side.\n\nI'm usually kind of skeptical of fancy Italian places because it often seems like the food should be so much cheaper (C'mon, it's just pasta!). But, as my friend said after dinner, \"That was pretty good! I'm actually not that sad that I just paid $17 for lasagna!\" And this is considering that both of us got incredibly spoiled by the availability of cheap and delicious Italian food in college.\n\nCome by early after work to avoid waiting and enjoy some fancy Italian comfort food.", "author": "Brittany C."}

I don't know if it was the fact that I hadn't eaten anything all day or I had never eaten real good Italian food before, but this place really seemed to hit the spot.\n\nIt's a quaint little restaurant right on the sidewalk, with elegant outdoor and indoor seating, fancy waiters, and fancier names for their food (that's how you know it's legit). \n\nOur waiter suggested some great items, we opted to try their pizza and pasta. Honestly, I cannot remember the names of either, but if you showed them the photos I posted, they would totally know what they were. And let me just say, GET WHAT WE GOT. My pasta was so yummy, not too overpowering, and the bread they gave us was delightful to dip in the oil. \n\nThe only complaint I have: they open at 5:30 for dinner. We walked in around 5:20 because their doors were wide open, and they kicked us back out, making us wait for 10 minutes. I understand they are getting things ready still; however, they should shut their doors or at least let us sit down and begin looking over the menu. \n\nMassimo was there, he's the owner, and he was very genuine and grateful.

I work in SoMa so I just Yelped some close-by Italian restaurants. That's when I came across this gem. \n\nThe ambiance is very cozy and once inside, it feels like a little escape from the city. We were greeted very warmly and seated promptly. Then, the goodies started to arrive:\n\n- Bread: Yes...bread. Something so basic yet so delicious! It was so warm and the inside was the perfect amount of fluffiness while the outside was just the right amount of crunchiness. Came with olive oil only so we had to ask for balsamic but the service here is great so they brought it right away. It was so good and I was so hungry that we ate it all and I was almost full by the time we were done with the bread. Oops! \n- Lasagna: It came in a perfect dish and was very warm and delicious. Only thing is that I felt it was a bit oily and watery. Would've liked mine a bit more baked but otherwise good.\n- Tortellini: The sauce was very good and the tortellini was good as well. Nothing that really blew my mind but it was overall satisfying.\n- White chocolate lemon cake: Yum! I think my favorite parts of the meal was the bread and dessert. The cake had the perfect balance of lemon and chocolate. It wasn't too lemony or chocolatey. Wonderful!  \n\nOverall, I liked the ambiance and the service was AMAZING. Our waiter was so friendly and very very attentive. Never forgot to give us anything we asked for. My favorite part - when we were leaving, he gave each of us A HANDSHAKE AND HUG!

The rigatoni with meat balls was rich, tender, and zesty--definitely a dish to take the chill off a summer night in The City.\n\nDesserts include an uber-creamy tiramisu (yum), and a carmel flan (meh).  The small, but adequate, wine list is fairly priced for San Francisco.  Do not expect trophy bottles, but rather some rather pedestrian suggestions that nonetheless complement the food.\n\nThe owner, Massimo, and the wait staff were friendly and attentive.  A downside was that the restroom is located in the kitchen area.  Hopefully with the planned remodel and expansion this ill will be cured.\n\nIf you need a fix of Italian food and can't get to North Beach, Pazzia Restaurant & Pizzeria has you covered.", "author": "CJ G."}

The pizza was super thin crusted and the flavor was ok. The ravioli was way too cheesy. I'm also not a huge fan of pink sauce but my friend really enjoyed it. The best dish was probably the spaghetti with sun dried tomato in olive oil. Could have definitely use some more sauce. I felt like I could have cooked it myself way better. \nThe tiramisu was one of the worst I've ever had. The cake didn't even tasted like coffee. Tasted more like a vanilla sponge cake.

This space is pretty small, and clearly popular.\n\nI asked the server if we could go get a drink and come back (I appreciate that a lot of restaurants let you do this.) She put us on the list for a reservation in 30 minutes, which worked out perfectly.\n\nWe were brought bread immediately, it was good, but i had to save to room for the meal.\n\nWe asked the server what her favorites were, and we ended up sharing: margherita pizza with spicy sausage and homemade gnocchi. \nThe pizza was good, but not my favorite.I prefer margherita pizza with the slices of fresh mozzarella versus the cheese that makes it feel like a standard cheese pizza.\nThe gnocchi was AMAZING. I'm not a big gnocchi fan, but my husband loves it. Unfortunately, very few places make a good gnocchi. This pick was a VERY good choice.\n\nThe server knew were sharing , and the kitchen plated it in two bowls. I was thinking we were going to get a split plate charge on the bill, but we didn't. How surprisingly nice!\n\nThe gnocchi was cooked perfectly, had great flavor, and I loved the spicy red sauce it came in. There was also a slice of fresh mozzarella on top. I would go back just for this dish.\n\nService was attentive, and food came at a good pace.

Italian food always makes me a little loosey goosey.\n\nMy boyfriend proposed we go to the San Francisco Auto Show at Moscone.  Yikes, I don't even have an outfit for an auto show!  I dressed as a mechanic for Halloween one year but hEllO, that costume would get me thrown right out of any Goodyear.  So after finding black leather pants and a long-sleeve that only Bon Jovi would wear, I set off on my date night, which started with Pazzia.\n\nWe were welcomed with a big smile and placed at a corner table by the window.  Fabulous little dimly-lit bistro, and fabulous view of the trashy people walking down 3rd Street.  When the server read the specials (literally took like 5 minutes, they have SO many specials), I settled on the burrata as an appetizer.  Delicious as always, I love burrata.  My boyfriend didn't.  Don't worry, I dumped him after the auto show. (kidding)., wait-are you reading this?\n\nHow was the rest of the food?  Oh ya.  Seafood risotto was delicious, boyfriend a pizza... and I had a little fruit tart for dessert which was--oh--a very nice fruit tart.  You really can't screw up a fruit tart, afterall.  My boyfriend had a lovely tiramasu, but packed with calories.  Yikes!  I nearly split my leather pants before dinner was over\n\nService at Pazzia is unbelievable.

But alas, the menu is just not very interesting here, and the execution borders a bit on the lazy. As a matter of fact, I came on a particularly lazy day, the day after Thanksgiving, when nobody was in the FiDi. I took two colleagues for a leisurely lunch there, and no one else was in the place at noon. \n\nWe shared an order of the $6 Bruschetta, which is normally a can't-lose at a real Italian restaurant. While I had no complaints about the fresh chopped tomatoes and basil on top, the toast underneath looked to be just a slice of wheat toast rather than a crunchy baguette (see photo). That just seemed so wrong. Better was the $13.25 Fusilli Alle Melanzane, a rather unadorned pasta dish with a barely there tomato sauce, basil and chunks of eggplant and mozzarella, which oddly looked and almost tasted like bits of butter (see photo). \n\nBut frankly I think I could have made that at home. In fact, I think I did make that at home. One of my colleagues ordered the $9 Insalata Medici with Belgian endives, rucola, pears, walnuts, Gorgonzola cheese and balsamic vinaigrette dressing (see photo). Even with the addition of chicken strips, there was nothing too extraordinary about it. Listen, with the much superior La Briciola down on the next block of 3rd, I don't think there's much reason to venture here unless you really want to eat like you never left your kitchen. \n\nFOOD - 3 stars...like you never left home...seriously! \nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...quite bright and open, especially when it's empty \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...she was pretty...and efficient \nTOTAL - 3 stars...not bad but kinda meh for Italiano", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-29", "description": "I'm a little biased when it comes to this review because my boyfriend lives upstairs, so we come here ALL the time and just keep coming back (because it's so easy to do so, and we just love it THAT much.) But Pazzia is one of my favourite Italian restaurants because it's so authentic and delicious. If you are looking for an Italian restaurant that is decent with their prices, and has a range of food-- DO IT. \n\nThe service is always top-notch here. But beware, because they're always busy and crowded. My best suggestion is to call the night of, at least half an hour to an hour ahead of when you want to actually eat there, and make a reservation for the time. That way you don't need to wait 30 minutes outside, because there is no real \"waiting\" area-- you will be stuck in the rain and the elements if it's not ideal out. \n\n I really come here for the appetisers. The burrata here never disappoints. It's always thick, creamy and delicious. My boyfriend and I fight over the last piece before deciding that we need to \"split everything evenly.\" And it comes with prosccuito di parma on the side. It's absolutely delicious and provides a great headstart to the meal.  I've never had the pizza here, so I cannot review on that. I always get the handmade pastas, or some pasta. I've had pretty much the entire range of pastas here and loved all of them, so I can't complain. My favourites have been the lasagna and the gnocchi. My boyfriend really likes the pizza, and can't finish a whole pizza by himself (though I'm sure if we didn't get the appetisers, he would definitely scarf the entire pizza down.) The lasagna here is made with bechamel sauce, so if you're imagining a purely tomato and meat sauce based lasagna, you might be a little disappointed. I'm not normally a fan of lasagna, so the fact that I like it here means it's fantastic.", "author": "Christa Lei S."}

Don't give me any stress!!! This is not the post office - you wait, you don't like it?? Deal with it!\"\n\nI understand that New Years is a busy and stressful time - but that attitude and obnoxious, arrogant behaviour was not something I've ever experienced in my life - even in crappy corner shops.\nCommon courtesy would have been a basic civil apology for the delay and a generic \"we'll get to you as soon as possible\"\n\nWe immediately left and had dinner at a wonderful Thai restaurant next door called osha where the staff was courteous and wonderful.\n\nDefinitely will not be going back and will be telling all my friends about this encounter.\n\nCustomer service goes a long way in determining loyalty to a restaurant.\nPiazza definitely lost it before we even tried it.", "author": "Nouf A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-11-09", "description": "It was an awkward night. The restaurant was crowded; people who didn't have reservations were getting angry at the hostess. Since there's no place to wait, we were all either standing inside (in the way) or out in the cold (freezing). The woman in front of me had the tag still hanging from her recently-purchased sweater and toilet paper stuck to her shoe. En route to the ladies' room I nearly bowled over the busboy, since the bathroom is located smack in the middle of the bustling kitchen. I requested a corner table but was told that the \"owner sits there;\" the runner-up option, for which I patiently waited, was bogarted by a couple who seated themselves without asking the hostess - she had to ask them to move. They gave me violent glares when I sat down, even though they scored another table within minutes. \n\nDespite the never-ending awkwardness, the staff were professional. They didn't get annoyed with the couples clamoring for seats, the lack of aisle space, or the patrons clogging the doorway. The hostess & waitress were instead patient and sweet. They seated me at the apparently controversial table I'd requested, made sure I had bread and wine - a bottle of the house red is only $30 - and managed not to glare at me for being a pain in the arse. I appreciated that.\n\nPerhaps my expectations were too high, but the food was disappointing. The special was pappardelle in pesto sauce with salmon and artichokes; since pappardelle is my favorite type of pasta and I'm a pesto fiend, it was a no-brainer. The only problem was that the pesto was - gasp! - bland. Bland basil? What happened to the garlic? What happened to the flavor?? Life becomes depressing when good Italian food goes awry. My friend loved his meal - linguine with clams and mussels - so perhaps it was an off night for the pesto. We started getting dirty looks for overstaying our welcome, and when I started to feel like I was back in NYC we decided to leave. Sad story. Next time I have a craving for Italian food I'll visit my elderly Italian neighbor instead!", "author": "Ray J."}

I had the Pollo alla Medici - a baked chicken breast with Marsala sauce.  The chicken was cooked perfectly - tender, juicy, and excellent flavor.  \n\nTheir pizza looks excellent.

You can taste the freshness in the ingredients which reminds me of when I lived in Italy.  Italians like their food basic, none of that Bucca di Beppo stuff.

I have often walked by this place on my way home from a Giants game and wondered why it was so packed full of people.  Another thing that always struck me was that everybody inside looked like they were having an absolute blast!  \n\nAfter meeting Massimo I now know exactly why people love him and his restaurant.  He provides the type of passion and sincere love of food and family that I have never felt on this side of the Atlantic.  He is an amazingly charismatic and caring man from Florence who has provided our great city with the true feel of one of the greatest dining cities in the world.  You can see his reflection in every aspect of Pazzia and the food is incredible! We had an amazing pizza with Gorgonzola and sausage that was by far the best pizza I have ever had stateside and quite possibly anywhere.  It paired perfectly with free flowing Pinot.  The food and staff is so authentically Italian I felt like I should have left with a stamp on my passport.  \n\nNormally sitting at a table next to my childhood hero Joe Montana would have been the highlight of any dining experience but I can honestly say that Massimo, his food and his amazing staff overshadowed seeing my man Joe Cool.

Supposedly, I was planning to give Zero Zero a try for the night, but unfortunately, the bar is fully booked and the hostess gives me a not so friendly attitude in which I have to force myself to search for another restaurant while wandering down the street. Having a sudden craving for pastas, my friends and I decided to give Pazzia a try because of its ratings. Once we got our seats, the waiter's attentive greeting makes us feel like we are home. Warm, whimsical, friendly, our waiter certainly possesses the best customer service qualities every customer asks for. \n\nAfter browsing through Pazzia's menus, we ordered the Lasagna, Gnocchi with Pomodoro Sauce and Tomatoes, and Spaghetti Vongole. The Lasagna is definitely the best, if not, one of the best Lasagnas I have not eaten in my entire life!!! It is homemade, light, and lively once you get to bite it. The sauce wonderfully compliments the impeccable texture of the pasta and this dish is definitely TO DIE FOR!! The Gnocchi is decently prepared with a Pomodoro sauce in which the flavors of the Tomatoes' juiciness would enhance the flavors of the gnocchi. The Spaghetti Vongole, to my disappointment, is not as tasty as I expected. It seems to be a little bit salty and lacks a certain seafood freshness for my taste buds.\n\nOnce we got our check, the waiter once again attentively greets us as if we were old friends. With our stomachs filled with the chef's culinary love and harmony,  Pazzia gives me a memorable experience that incorporates warmth, happiness, and an easygoing dining process in which I have not been experiencing for a while.

The restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside, to be frank, and it's a bit small (even when the windows are thrown open given nice weather outside). But it's that coziness, along with the delicious Italian food that's served here, that makes it feel cozy. Our waiter's thick Italian accent certainly didn't hurt either, making us feel like we were getting the real Italian deal. The service was great, with the waiter making friendly banter with us and getting our food out pretty quickly.\n\nGiven I didn't want to eat anything too far outside the bounds of plain-ish pasta, I didn't sample as much of the other food as I would have preferred. That said, the burrata is really good here - very creamy, but not overly thick and heavy - in other words, really good buffalo mozzarella. It's served with a good chunk of arugula, which I could take or leave, depending on the mood. I shouldn't forget to mention that it pairs well with the bread served at the table, which is freshly-baked and maintains a bit of that fluff that soaks up the olive oil it gets dipped in. For my main dish, I went with the rigatoni, which was cooked perfectly al dente - not too chewy, but cooked enough not to be tough to the bite. The sausage was delicious (although I wish there was more of it), and the mushrooms rounded out the dish well when paired with the tomato sauce. I had a bite of the spaghetti with clams, which was also very good - and very light; the olive oil and garlic provided plenty of flavoring when paired with the clams.\n\nPazzia may not seem like much from the outside, but this is a very solid Italian restaurant in the heart of SoMa. I'd love to come back sometime and try some of the other pasta dishes, as well as what looked like a delicious thin-crust pizza.

And that is exactly as Pazzia can be best described - very gooey, cheesy pizza. After an interesting night prior to my glutton fest at Pazzia, I was eager to eat. Furthermore, I was eager to eat greasy food as my hungover helper. Pizza came to mind when I perused Yelp as the best and closest Italian restaurant.\n\nI am definitely pleased with our choice, because of the walking distance; however I am certain there is prevailing pizza joints in the Bay Area. Once we were seated it was a tad frustrating to notice there was only one server among a plethora of lunch guests. 'Whew, okay,' I thought to myself - 'I can be patient...' That would have been the case if the pizza was that damn good and worth waiting for. It wasn't. Neither was the slow service. The service was friendly and fast enough considering the circumstances, but the excessive grease pooling in the center of my pizza just didn't win me over. Next visit to San Francisco, I am definitely tying it again, but for the more traditional Italian dishes.", "author": "Frances H."}

I would comment more on what we ate, but frankly, I don't remember exactly what I ate.  It was a pasta dish and it was good.  My buddy also had a pasta dish and he enjoyed it.  \n\nWe sat outside on a nice evening.  Perhaps the only thing I would say is that the foot traffic can bother you if you let it.

Would definitely come back.\n\nOrdered the Funghi E Salsiccia pizza, Papperdelle, and a dry prosecco to share.  I'm picky about my food being oversalted and overseasoned.  Pazzia did not disappoint.  Everything was appropriately seasoned; both dishes were no frills, authentic entrees with fresh, simple ingredients.  The prices were reasonable for the portions you get (pizzas are $12-15ish and pastas $14-19ish).  We had decent appetites, but still walked away with leftovers (which I'm excited to finish).

But when we got there, it was packed full (the restaurant's pretty small, but you're in luck! they're expanding!). I went in to ask how long the wait might be and the nicest waitress in the world came over to tell me that it'd be around 40 minutes. She asked if I wanted to put my name down to wait, and I figured I'd go ask my friends first. We decided to try to find someplace else, but couldn't think of a place, so we backtracked and she put our name down. (She's seriously one of the sweetest ladies I've ever met. :D I don't know her name, but if you ever read this, you're awesome!)\n\nThey actually seated us much sooner than we thought they would. It was pretty hot in the restaurant, but I liked the ambiance. \n\nSince we're big on getting different things so we can split them all and try everything, we ordered the gnocchi, the ravioli, and a pizza (it started with an 'f' but I don't remember what it really said...it was mushroom, basil, and mozzarella? something like that). They were freaking awesome. I was half in starvation mode, so I polished off almost the entire basket of bread (in my defense, the others said they were fine). Olive oil + pepper made it even more awesome.\n\nThe food we ordered was absolutely amazing. The ravioli had a nice zing to it and I really liked the meat sauce. I think this is my new favorite Italian restaurant, of all the ones I've ever been to, although the one in Walnut Creek still has a special place in my heart because of its tiramisu.

It's a cute little place in SOMA and when we came upon it, I thought, it's got to be good because it was packed (albeit a small restaurant) and the owner seemed so nice and greeted us right away while we waited for our 8pm reservation.  I really really really wanted to like this place but I was underwhelmed at best.  The food was mediocre.  My pasta really lacked taste.  I mean, it's always a bad sign when I keep salting it over and over and over.  The presentation was eh.  The service was seriously lacking.  They initially were really nice, but it seems they don't know how to handle a crowd.  We waited over 40 minutes to get our bill, after asking for it about 5 times.  We would ask for our bill - then we would watch the waiter go and socialize with someone else, hugging, laughing with others.  Then we'd watch him stand at the counter doing who knows what. Then we ask again.   And again, we see the same thing, him dilly dallying and doing other things.  Then we ask again.  And again.  It was seriously annoying.  Finally, we got our tab, and he came up with some excuse that the table next to us had an issue with their bill and he was working to solve that and that is why it took him so long to get us our tab.  Um... the only thing was that the party next to us left a while before we finally got our tab.  \n\nYelpers usually don't steer me wrong, but in this case, I am just going to have to be in the minority here and say this place is just Eh.", "author": "Lora H."}

It's in my neighborhood, it's Italian, it's locally owned, and Yelpers seem to dig it. Unfortunately, my dinner experience on a Saturday night was not a success. Was it the techno music playing coupled with the bright lighting at 8pm? Was it when our main courses came to the table and we were not even half-way through our appetizer? Was it the bottle of red wine that was way too warm? Insert sadface here.\n\nI could honestly overlook all of this if the food was tasty, but, sadly, it fell short. The delicious burrata and prosciutto appetizer was the highlight of the evening without question. However, the main course mushroom pennette I ordered, and the meat tortelloni in mushroom sauce my husband ordered, were just meh. I love all things funghi, but my dish was more pennette and less mushroom. My husband's order appeared to have been sitting at the pass for awhile because of the visible film of coagulated mushroom sauce from the dish cooling before it came to our table (as we were still eating our appetizer as I mentioned earlier). He was also disappointed in the tortelloni's mushroom sauce and compared its lack of flavor to a can of mushroom soup. Yeesh.  \n\nI love simple, rustic, lovingly made Italian food served with the same care that went into its creation. Unfortunately, the ambiance and service made us feel rushed, and the food was memorable for all the wrong reasons.

Obviously, the restaurant is key for a successful reunion - and I don't live in San Francisco so my knowledge was limited.  Based on extensive internet searches, I chose Pazzia and made a reservation two weeks before our dinner. \n\nWith a group that size, I was extremely worried that my reservation would get lost or they would separate us into separate tables.  However, my concerns were alleviated when the manager called the next day to confirm my reservation and assured me that we would be seated together.  When we got to the restaurant - sure enough, we had a single table which ran right down the middle of the restaurant.\n\nWe ordered a variety of pizzas, pastas, and desserts and shared everything (family style).  I wish I remembered specific names - but everything was delicious.  The pizza was amazing - an uber thin (almost cracker-like) crust with fabulous cheese and high quality toppings.  One had prosciutto (aka expensive bacon - and everything is better with bacon).  The cheesecake was perfect - not overly sweet. \n\nThroughout the whole night (and we were there from ~6:30-~9:00), we never felt like we were \"taking up a table\" or the wait-staff wanted us out of there.  Even when an 11th person showed up late (a spouse who originally couldn't make it), a chair and silverware were immediately located.  Everyone was extremely helpful, and the relaxed ambiance in the restaurant lends itself to a fun - yet high quality - dining experience.  \n\nIt was as though I had everyone over to my house - except I didn't have to cook or clean!

The service was very good, and the owner was clearly attending to lots of details around the restaurant. There were a few groups enjoying long meals together and all seemed relaxed and happy. I ordered a prosciutto and arugula pizza, and something about it was just off -- it was a little too cheesy and the prosciutto was kind of limply laid on top. I like it when salume gets crispy like bacon on pizza; that might just be a matter of taste. But the un-crispy prosciutto was kind of chewy and not very pleasant to eat. It just wasn't a very flavorful pizza for $17. What's more, the music was pretty loud, alternating between some unusual electronica and Italian pop ballads. This might be okay when dining with someone else, but as a solo diner it made it difficult for me to focus on reading my magazine article. It sounds like others have had better experiences with the food, so it's possible I just had an off meal. A slightly better meal and quieter music would have tipped this over into a much nicer experience. That said, the server and owner obviously care about what they're doing.\n\nEdit: I came back here to give it three stars instead of two. After three days of leftovers, the crust was still very delicious. Got to give credit for that.", "author": "Laura H."}

Because of its location, I had always assumed it was a chain or another restaurant with mediocre food charged for a hefty sum. I was pleasantly surprised. Nicely but plainly decorated inside, Pazzia doesn't seem too special inside. \n\nA group of four, we ordered three pasta dishes and a risotto dish. The consensus was that food was tasty. Pasta prices range from $12 - $16. Their portion size isn't huge, but not too small either. Glasses of wine go for about $10. If you're in the area, craving Italian and don't feel like paying +$35 per person, I would recommend Pazzia. \n\nTIP: Make reservations. No Opentable option, so call. Pazzia gets crowded on Friday & Saturday nights. Ask for a booth vs. middle tables. Middle tables are esp. no good when it's cold outside. They leave their doors open bc there is outdoor seating.

I haven't had a calzone that big or that good since I was in Italy. It was absolutely HUGE. Literally, I couldn't even eat a quarter of it and I was stuffed. I'll be having leftovers for days. The caesar salad probably had one of the best dressings I've ever had and the greens were so crisp. The ambiance here kinda sucks. \n\nDownfalls: the decor is boring and the techno house music they were playing in the background was weird and out of place.

There's almost no lag time between when a dish is finished and when it gets to your table. The pasta comes in steaming, like it's just been taken off the pan, and the lasagna comes with its cheese bubbling.\n\nTry the lasagna. I find it to be exquisitely good. It has a subtlety of flavor that I've never experienced before, and every person who I've taken to the restaurant has commented on how it was some of the best lasagna they've ever had. I also love the homemade tiramisu.\n\nThe only issue I have is that there aren't enough meat dishes on the menu, though if you're a cheese-is-okay sort of vegetarian, this is a great place to eat. Also, the daily specials don't actually change that much from day to day (the soup du jour is probably minestrone 90% of the time).

Service was unremarkable. Maybe this place used to be good. Or maybe it just has its good and bad days. But I was not impressed.", "author": "g k."}

We had pizza, bruschetta with heirloom tomatoes, salmon with pasta, lasagna, and various salads.  I had the beet salad and thought it tasted too strongly of olive oil.  It was advertised as having a vinaigrette dressing but my salad had no acidic overtones but had only a flat olive oil taste.  I am not fond of shredded lettuce which is what my beets were floating in.  The best part of my salad was the goat cheese.  The 9.95 price was reasonable but I just didn't enjoy the salad.\n\nI sampled the heirloom tomato bruschetta and the tomato topping was very fresh and this was perhaps the highlight of the meal.  I also sampled the pasta with salmon and bacon and thought the pasta was overcooked and the dish overly salty.  In fact, I heard similar complaints from other patrons that their dishes were too salty/greasy.  One guest waited more than fifteen minutes for her glass to be refilled with water.  She also complained that she was forced to order an entree though management previously said that there were no minimum orders.\n\nThe ambiance is nice here.  If you want to eat pizza in a room with lighted candles and white tablecloth then Pazzia is your place.  I regret not trying their pizza as it seems to be the most raved about food on Yelp.   I would come back but only to try the pizza and definitely not over the weekend as it is is a small venue and overcrowded at these times.", "author": "Lorissa W."}

Each of the foods I tried (pizza, bruschetta, gnocchi, and bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar) was a hit for me. \n\nTheir pizza isn't my favorite, but it was done well and had great flavors. Definitely try it if you like thin crust pizzas.\n\nThe bread was quite tasty, but a little doughy in the center. That said, I'm don't eat italian foods regularly, so I'm not sure if that's normal - it was a bit of an odd texture for me though.\n\nThe gnocchi was fantastic. Served with wedges of mozzarella on top, it's definitely the best gnocchi I had.\n\nMy favorite item, however, was the bruschetta. Perhaps it's odd that this is my favorite, but I was surprised by how wonderful it tasted. It's not like it was a very complex bruschetta compared to others I've seen. As far I as I could tell, it was simply oiled bread that had been toasted, topped with fresh tomatoes, fresh basil, and a little sauce. What made it work was the simplicity and attention to detail - each part of the dish was perfect; the bread was toasted just right and added a crunch to the texture, the basil and tomato (one of my favorite combinations) had the right proportions relative to each other and their freshness was delightful, and finally the sauce added just enough complexity to blend all of the other flavors together.

We scanned the menu and the non-pizza prices were a little higher than expected. Not astronomical, but given the relative lack of atmosphere and polish I would have expected it to be a bit cheaper. We decided to split some salads and pizza and that was definitely the way to go as our bill was quite reasonable and we got to try a bit of everything. \n\nThe beet salad was very good, but I don't typically meet a bad beet salad.

If anyone asks that, rather than just throwing 3 cards in, it means that they would like each person's tab separately. \n\nInstead of informing us that they can't do that, the waitress was like \"If you each put in a card we can split it 3 ways\", which confused my friend, and when he asked again after the bill came to clarify, the waitress made it awkward for all of us by explaining that it'd be a difference of a dollar for each person paying and it's difficult to split the bill that way because their system is old blah blah blah. Honey, I understand that/ can do basic math, but that's not your role in this and you should have politely said \"Sorry, we don't split bills\" to begin with rather than give us attitude and a sob story.\n\nAs for food: My oven-roasted chicken + side potatoes were pretty meh.

The food is excellent.  I ordered the spinach tortelloni with a creamy mushroom sauce which was heavenly.  They give you a full cup of parmesan cheese to go with your pasta, so you can add as much as you want when you want.  For dessert I ordered the cream caramel, and it could have been a little more caramelized on top.  But overall it wasn't too bad.  The service was a bit hit and miss.  Our waiter never gave us a chance to order drinks or appetizers first, he just came over after awhile and asked if we were ready for the whole order.  And after everything was done, and the couple next to us was gone, it took forever to get our check.

The cream wasn't over powering and it was just right. The boy's food was good, he devoured it...alongside the bread that came with it. My sis just picked on the two pasta dishes that she ordered...one with shrimp and the other with salmon. \n\nI told boy that we needed to go back there and he agreed...overall the food was good...the ambiance of the place was quite nice though since it's small, it can get pretty darn hot and crowded.

Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but we were really really disappointed for what we got for the price.  My husband had salmon, and it was literally a small piece of grilled salmon and like 5 pieces of roasted vegetables on a large white plate.  The salmon wasn't even that great.  And it cost like $25.  Really?  I could have gotten salmon from trader joe's and it would have been just as good.  I ordered pasta, which was OK, but not great.

NO HEAT LAMPS! They should add this amenity, for sure. \n\nUnfortunately, we didn't split anything, which I think was a mistake.  This is probably the type of place you want where you split a few pizzas between the entire table, but not everyone in our party wanted pizza.  We had an order of the chicken stuffed with prosciutto, which looked great and came with a plentiful helping of potatoes and broccoli.  The mussels, which I ordered were pretty good! The light tomato sauce was a nice change from a white wine sauce, which is what I'm usually served when I go with mussels.  The mussels themselves were on the smaller side and had there not been bread on the table, I would still be starved.  We also had a margherita pizza and an order of spaghetti bolognese.

I have had urges of learning Italian (which I am), reading Italian poetry, and drinking italian wine (tasty). Luckily, I came across this resturaunt because a good friend had come into town and saw the many good reviews on yelp - and let me be the first to tell you that the stars on Yelp are well earned. \n\nWe had arrived a bit later in the evening, without a reservation (which I highly recommend you get), so we had to wait for about 20 to 30 minutes. No matter, the moment a group left the table it was cleaned and reset for our group. While we waiting for them to set up the table the manager (a very personable and  sincere man) asked if we would like some wine while we waited and gave us the menu so we could get a head start on the ordering. Afterward we were seated we were greeted by a very knowledgeable waitress who helped us with our wine selection and food selection. \n\nNow comes the part where I attempt to describe the food with words to entice you to come. Two of my friends shared a spaghetti dish with clams, which happened to be amazing! They have a very fresh supply of clams (no fishy smell). My other friend got a vegetarian spaghetti with sea bass - also fantastic! I personally love salmon, so I get this ravioli dish that had this crazy orange sauce and fresh salmon stuffed inside each one. Each bite was one to die for...unfortunately, the portion was a bit tiny (about 8-10 pieces), and I had consumed the food in a matter of minutes. \n\nWith the food aside, the restaurant itself gives off a very \"homey\" feel to it, which I personally enjoy. It's not one of those italian or french restaurants where you need to dress up and get all fancy. To me, it gave off more of a warm, comfortable, and relaxed vibe. When you enter the restaurant the place was bustling with families and friends just drinking wine and having a good time. It's not too loud where you can't hear yourself, but it's also not so quiet you can hear the chef breathing - it's just right. They're were couples having a romantic evening together, tables of 10+ people laughing and sharing stories, and elderly individuals just sitting and enjoying a glass of wine - like a said, very relaxed. :)\n\nSo please, do yourself a favor and check out this restaurant. It's a great place of almost any occasion, and honestly, I didn't rave too much about the food because - well - it's just damn good. There's not much more to say than that. I figured, if a place is always packed, then it must be good. :) So please check this place out if you're ever in the area, it's worth your time.", "author": "Alfred B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-03-21", "description": "This place is great! Truly italian food and very well prepared!\nWe were a large group and we sampled many dishes from the menu.\nWe started with some thin crust pizzas as appetizer: \"funghi & salsiccia\"  and \"capricciosa\", both delicious. \n\nAfter having read many misleading opinions on italian pizza, I feel like making a little comment at this point. There is no such thing as an \"italian pizza\". In fact, there are different kind of italian pizzas:\n\n(1) Napolitan pizza is THE original pizza, some of its variants (margherita and marinara) are D.O.P. products (Denominazione di Origine Protetta) and, among other predefined requisites, they are supposed to have thin crust in the middle and thick on the edge;\n(2) Roman pizza is the traditional \"overall\" thin crust;\n(3) the thick focaccia-like Sicilian pizza;\n(4) several other variants (focaccia genovese, pizza al tegamino, etc.).\n\nThe first two (the most popular in pizzeria's) are supposed to be foldable without cracking. New York style pizza is not very different from a Roman pizza, it is just bigger and typically more oil-ish. It was introduced in New York by italians, who basically kept the original recipes but made them larger and with different toppings.\n\nAfter this short premise, I must say that Pazzia delivers a good example of italian thin crust pizza (more Roman than Napolitan) with a good choice of ingredients. In particular, the one with mushrooms and salsiccia (in this case a typical sausage with fennel seeds) offers a really rich combination of flavours.\n   \nAs main dish, I had homemade spinach gnocchi with a meat sauce and it was nothing less than divine. The tiramis\u00f9 was also worth to be mentioned: soft, creamy, juicy, not too sweet, with a strong espresso flavour and still, surprisingly,  relatively light.  \n\nThe service was impeccable, our waitress was very friendly and competent, ready to give info and good advices.  \nThey also have an artisan italian beer, called Menabrea (from Biella, near Torino), which I recommend to anybody interested in trying an example of  good italian beer (forget Moretti or Peroni ...).\n\nEverybody at our table was enthusiast at the end of the meal ...\nFull score with no doubt!", "author": "Andrea L."}

So I attended my first official yelp event as Christopher S's  plus one ( I am not elite). I like to think that maybe one day I will be, but that is another story for another day.

The food was so delicious, just sitting here writing this review is making me want to hop in my car and drive to the city just so that I can dine here again. I had the filet and the boys had the tortellini's and lasagna (which are even more amazing when you steal them off other peoples plates, than when you order them yourself, at least that's my story). The food was really good. I just can't describe how good exactly, it was like my taste buds began singing praises to the chef god. I was tempted to start licking the plates.

Tables are tight so if you're looking for a quiet intimate experience this isn't the place for you. Pazzia was packed during a recent week night visit.  After we were seated, folks were waiting for a table.  Always a good sign.  Try to sit against the wall on either side where there's less jostling about.\n\nThe house salad was a good place to start - lots of romaine,  radicchio, arugula was a little sparse, vinaigrette with fresh garlic but not overpowering, rich nutty parmesan, Reggiano maybe, and crunchy house made croutons, I'm sure made from their yummy bread.  The Bresaola was disappointing, the beef mushy and coming apart, hard to describe.  The bread is wonderful by the way.\n\nThe Capricciosa pizza was a mixed bag.  The crust was near perfect - crunchy, chewy with good tug, some char, with nice palate pleasing flavor and scent.  The tomatoes. artichoke and olives all worked well together but the prosciutto hovered over the pie like Aladdin's magic carpet.  Tried to cut it into pieces and have a piece with every bite but it didn't seem to work.  Daily pasta with farfalle, chicken and rabe was tasty but nothing special, not enough of the garlicy rabe to my taste.\n\nWe had a tasty wine, a red blend recommended by our server and a good value at $30.  The wines appeared all reasonably priced.  The wait staff and owner were attentive, friendly and welcoming.  Of course as close as everyone is, seating wise, it would be hard not to be.

The $8 house salad was disappointingly small and obviously overpriced for greens, pine nuts, and ONE slice of tomato.\n\nBut I should have cherished that one tomato....\n\nBecause then my Margherita Pizza was delivered. I looked in disbelief at the CHEESE PIZZA sitting in front of me. Let me back up - the staff here is Italian and I was falsely under the impression that that would have an impact on the authenticity of the Italian cuisine. But here I was staring down at a $12 slightly-larger-than-personal size CHEESE pizza labeled as a Pizza Margherita. I asked the waitress if this was indeed the Margherita or their had been a mistake. She assured me that it was the correct pizza. I asked about the lack of basil and tomatoes on top. She asked if I'd like to have some fresh basil on top .... well DUH - that is half of what makes up the pizza I ordered. She brought it back with some sliced up pathetic basil on top of this greasy thin-crust cheap cheese pizza.  \n\nI was pissed. I should have sent it back or asked to speak with the manager. But I didn't.\n\nMy boyfriend's sausage and mushroom pizza was also sub-par. Their are only 2 beers available and they are both $6/bottle. Or BYOB wine with a $20 corkage fee. Whatever!\n\nFor 6 of us (two non-drinkers, and the other 4 having 2 beers each + salads + entrees) the bill with gratuity added automatically (dick move) was ~$225.

The space is cozy, so I can see it being a nice spot for an intimate casual dinner date as well. \n\nOur group of six started with three salads to share: a caesar, caprese and medici (endives with pear). The medici was my fave. For my entree, I had the sausage and mushroom pasta. Instead of the rigatoni it came with, I asked them to substitute it with fettucini. It was a nice portion, and super tasty. One of us had the sausage and mushroom pizza, which was huge! It's certainly large enough for 2 or 3 people to share. For dessert, we had the tiramisu, affogato, and creme caramel (similar to flan). They were all delicious, but the affogato (vanilla ice cream in espresso) was my favorite. \n\nGood to know this place is in the Yelperhood.", "author": "Connie C."}

Walking distance from where I live, Pazzia serves unpretentious yet authentic Italian fare with a Florentine flavor. \n\nThe place isn't that big and it can get quite crowded easily. The wall paintings of Florence, particularly the Ponte Veccio, really give the place character. This is slightly diminished by the owners penchant for trance music. Weird, I know.\n\nThe food is pretty good. The pastas and meats stand out and they don't suffer for San Francisco pricing.

(Angel hair spaghetti with some vegetables? I can make that at home.) However, they had no problem at all with me requesting ravioli with pomodoro instead of meat sauce. Very good sign - some places can be so firm about their specials; Pazzia was very flexible and accomodating. My ravioli were delicious. My salad was so smothered in dressing as to be nigh inedible. The pizza was also very good. It's not a truly thin-crusted Napoletano pizza, but it's not as thick-crusted as a standard American pizza, either.

Most everyone seems to love it, and I was hoping to find a nice little place with some good, basic, true Italian pizza and pasta. \n\nWell now for reality. \n\nTo start on a positive I loved the proprietor. He is a wonderful host in true Italian fashion. 3 of our party of six came in 45 minutes early, and he was happy to seat us with a flourish of hand gestures in a full house so we could have some wine to start. He could have easily seated someone else first to try to maximize his space. \n\nSigh... the pizza. Wonderful flavors, excellent crust ;except the center third of the pizza was soft and soggy and could not hold itself or the topping. Again, the flavours were there, just not the structure. I don't expect a steel plate, but half the slice not even making it off the serving pan? \n\nDouble sigh.. the pasta. I also ordered the Puttanesca. Olives, capers, spice, and a hint of anchovy. Did I say a hint of anchovy? As in you can't quite place that flavour that completes the dish, but would know it if someone said anchovy? I received anchovy pasta. Unacceptable. \n\nAm I being picky? I don't know; I have a long ass Italian last name that no one can pronounce so maybe I am. Bad day at Pazzia? Maybe. But I do know that the owner/proprietor needs to quality control his flavors and food a bit. Get everything back to where I am sure it started and is meant to be. \n\nI will be back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-26", "description": "Wow!  They really know how to do pizza here.  I had heard good things about the pizza here.  And with the Elite event around the corner at Supperclub, what better time to try it out before the event.  Judging from the conversations heard about dinner at Supperclub and elsewhere, I'm glad I picked Pazzia.  I got a group of Yelpers together to join me and my friend enjoy a taste of Italy.  I called up to make a reservation and spoke with Daniella.  I told her that I was looking to get a table for 10 for Wed nite.  She said she'd have Massimo, the owner, get back to me.  And sure enough, Massimo was very accommodating.  But I could hear it in his voice...he seemed a little hesitant.  Having never been to Pazzia before, I'd never seen the size of the restaurant.  When I got there, I could see why he cautioned that I limit the party size.  The dining area is about 20x20 (and as someone had mentioned, the kitchen is almost as big), so there really wasn't room for large parties.  The place was packed at 7:30...I really wondered whether we'd even get seated.  We waited about 10-15 min for them to get our table together.  I hated to tell them that we actually had 11 showing up instead of 10.  Massimo made sure that we'd all fit.  In the end, it all worked out.\n\nOnto the food...I decided to come here because it was touted to have one of the best thin crust pizzas around in the City.  I had noticed the pizza ordered at another table, so I was ready to put them to my taste test.  I briefly looked at the menu.  Everything sounded good, but I was here for one thing...pizza.  I ordered a funghi e salsaccio pizza, and like everyone else at the table who ordered a pizza, we didn't think it'd be that big. When it came out, it reminded me of the pizzas that I had in Italy.  It almost brought tears to my eyes.  I wanted to dig in, but my friend reminded me to wait til everyone was served.  I told her that such a masterpiece can not be left to cool off...its meant to be eaten right out of the oven.  I tried to bribe my dining mates with a slice, just so that I could get started...they didn't fall for it.  When everyone was served, I savored the crispness of the crust and the fresh flavors of the mushroom and sausages.  It was not overdone with toppings, nor was it covered completely with cheese.  Everything was well proportioned.  This was Italian style pizza...unlike any East Coast or West Coast pies....just simple ingredients topped on a cracker-like crust with a perfect tomato sauce that had just the right amount of tangyness.  I've had A16's pizza and while they're comparable, I definitely prefer Pazzia's pizza.  My friend ordered the risotto, which came out looking wonderful, creamy, and full of seafood.  I tried a little and thought it was really good, but I was also busy concentrating on my pizza.  Luckily for me, my friend was trying to cut back on her meat consumption, so she didn't eat too much of mine.  Even with her helping me, I had to struggle to eat the last slice.  I only wish I had something to come home to...leftovers from Pazzia.\n\nI had a peek into the kitchen , and was surprised to see such a small arrangement of appliances.   I expected to see an authentic brick oven in the back, but it just appeared to be one of those large pizza ovens, powered by gas/electric.  Maybe my eyes deceived me.  I know their stove was not one of those large commercial versions that a lot of restaurants use, but I was surprised how efficient they were with what they had.  \n\nPeople in my party were a little surprised that their spirit selection was minimal.  I was hoping to sample a Peroni beer, but was left with only a Moretti beer to select from.  The Moretti wasn't a bad choice, as I recall having it in Firenze and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then.  Had I brought a wine connoisseur along, I'm sure the wine list would get critiqued, but I'm not that person.  I wasn't aware of the discrepancy in the bill, until someone mentioned it.  It was a little noisy in the small confines, but I seemed to look past it all, as we all seemed to have a great time.  I was appreciative to the staff and Massimo for making us feel at home.  And I was glad that my dining companions enjoyed the dinner and the conversations.\n\nI'll definitely be coming back...albeit, in a smaller drove.  And for now...Pazzia will be kept at the top of my Italian style pizza heap in the Bay Area.", "author": "JeFF T."}

STOP IT, these are MY businesses, stop taking up room at my dining table!\n\n(breathe M, breathe) *obnoxious, hoarding episode passes*\n\nAlright, I'll share Pazzia with the lot of you, seeing that my friend Dean was generous enough to share it with me.\n\nAside from the slightly hurried atmosphere I've gotten on occasion while dining, it gets pretty rustic in here. Our meals in Italy consisted of three-hour-long meals that gave plenty of time for digestion- here, they want to be able to seat the next set of foodmongers. The host is a gregarious character, scooting between servers, spending time at tables with O.G. Italians and greeting hungry patrons with his heavy accent. Actually, the whole restaurant staff aside from the bussers seems imbued with Italy, which I love, and the staff seems to have a good working relationship with the Host/Owner which shows in their attitude. It's a little on the louder side, and the tables are rather tightly packed, but it's not to the degree where you're part of your neighboring table's conversation.\n\nThe food is wonderful here- fresh, clean tasting and not Sicilian style (I'm allergic to garlic and onions but still love the Italian cuisine- leave me alone) like so many other places that are far too liberal with the  bulb. I believe the cuisine is closer to Florence, but at any rate it is more nothern style Italian, which means less garlic. The salads are lightly dressed and the daily special salads reflect the season's bounty. Their vegetable antipasti is not premade and cold like many other places do- it's warm off the grill, and lightly salted for accent.\n\n\nThey have many wonderful pasta, flatbread (thin crust pizza) and meat entrees- I've had too many different ones to begin describing them but suffice it to say, all of my meals here have been fantastic.  I believe they make their own bread too, which has always come to the table warm and fragrant.\n\nOne thing that made me REALLY HAPPY- delicous affogato (ascoop of rich, creamy vanilla ice cream floating in espresso). I prefer this over tiramisu any day. Ok I'll fess up. Their affogato always transports me back to Venice to a tiny, romantic pincushion of a restaurant right next to a canal where my boyfriend and I sat next to the window and made everyone else sick, but really, affogato is delicious and you should try it. I digress.\n\nI want to take away half a star for making me smell like food, but the alternative to that would be them installing a hurricane-force exhaust system which would make the place drafty and whistly, so never mind.

I am by no means a \"germophobe\" but there is something inherently wrong with that.  And pardon my vulgarity, but smelling someone else's bowel movement anywhere near the kitchen where my food is prepared is not my idea of sanitary.  \n\nWe should have left immediately after that experience.  I'll preface my review by saying we tried pazzia after countless friends had made recommendations and we had some lofty expectations.  Fair or not, pazzia met none of them. Even with reservations we waited nearly 30 minutes.  When we were finally seated, by a very rude older gentleman, we hoped our night might start getting better.  It was a special occasion and we were really trying to have a great night.  \n\nNo server appeared for another 15 minutes.  We sat, and waited more.  When the server finally showed up we asked her for a wine list which we didn't get until literally one minute before our meal arrived.  When our meal arrived, my date's pizza was cold.  By now, things had gone so badly it wasn't even worth sending back.  My date and I shared my plate, an over seasoned and over-cooked chicken and pasta dish that would have had potential on a typical night. \n\nOnce it was time to pay, I asked for the pizza to be taken off our bill; my date hadn't touched it aside from the failed temperature check.  I wasn't able to ask earlier because we were in the corner, (closest to the toilet) and hadn't seen our server since she delivered our meal.  Predictably, she made a fuss and said she'd send over the \"manager.\"\n\nWhat a character this guy was.  \"Massimo,\" like the cheap t-shirt,  was coincidentally the same \"gentleman\" who seated us.  Cocky and devoid of any empathy whatsoever he became very defensive and argumentative about our meal.  Again, it was untouched.  I even told him he could put it back in the microwave and re-serve it, since it was as cold as a frozen DiGiornio anyways.  This guy was horrible.  Worthy of deportation without question.  What kind of owner argues with a customer about their opinion regarding his business?!  Its laughable.  \n\nWe won't be going back anytime soon.  I have worked in restaurants before and always did everything I could for the customer.  Especially on special occasions.  I wasn't even the owner or manager and I hated when customers had poor experiences.  I realize cold food, poor service, etc is the nature of the business, but how can you not take advantage of an opportunity to turn a horrible experience into a great one?

My sister and I went here tonight (4/2/08) for dinner based on the good reviews. I'm sorry to say that after much good luck with Yelp in the past, it let me down this time. I can say that the restaurant was quaint -- small space, a bit warm, but not too squished. We were seated right away and ordered a salad to split (it had pear, blue cheese or gorgonzola, walnuts, arugula, and endive) and a sausage and mushroom pizza to split as well.\n\nThe service was prompt, and after a short time, we ate the salad. Nothing too memorable -- and it didn't really look as fresh as it could have been. Then came the pizza. What a disappointment. The mozzarella was globbed in the middle, and it overtook the whole pizza so that the t-to-d (toppings-to-dough) ratio was completely off. The tomato sauce tasted as if the chef opened a can called \"Tomato Sauce\" and poured it over the pizza. The pizza was incredibly bland. Not what I'm looking for in a pizza.\n\nThe redeeming factors:\n- The ambiance. Not too loud. Not too soft.\n- The service. Never an empty water glass. Never a long wait for the food or table.\n- The company.

It's been here a long time, I remember when it opened in the 80s because I worked down the street. And three years ago, I asked for something not on the menu - carbonara - and they made one the best renditions I'd ever tasted. Incredible attention to food. \n\nLast night, I went back with a number of friends and was pleased to see carbonara on the special menu, so I ordered it again. I got a disappointing pasta with bits of cooked egg, the one thing every recipe warns you will happen if you screw it up. I pointed this out to Massimo, the owner, who let me know this is the way it's supposed to be cooked. Bull!\n\nI noticed that Natalia the waitress, while beautiful and charming took our orders and brought them to the table (I love a place that doesn't segregate waiters and runners) -- but she couldn't remember who had what. In the case of the salads, five minutes had gone by, but she had no clue.  \n\nThere is a mural over the kitchen depicting a man who may have been the previous owner, not sure, but he isn't around and the place looks the same but the quality is gone. They are feeding off the steady stream of convention chum that strolls over from the Moscone now.

Ok, curse me all you want, but I've just never really been into the whole tomato sauce, olive, parmesan cheese thing. Never really cared for pizza and always preferred Asian noodles over Italian pasta. With that said, it's VERY hard to impress me when it comes to Italian food.\n\nPazzia is one of the first restaurants to ever make me love Italian food. It's a very small, very intimate restaurant that carries a very upscale charm. I loved the waitresses at Pazzia -- our waitress had a beautiful, intoxicating Italian accent that made everything she said sound so sexy... including \"The bathroom is through the kitchen.\" Yeah baby, say that again.\n\nI thought they served very, very delicious table bread. A perfectly-baked foccacia-type bread that was great with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. I could have probably eaten that all night (and probably would have saved me some cash). I got the lasagna, which was really good -- the flavor was awesome. It was, however, pretty tiny -- didn't really fill me up that much (thank God for the table bread). The medici salad was okay, but nothing to write home about. The bolognese fetteccini was really well-made -- nice pasta texture and hearty sauce.\n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu (VERY delicious) and the affogado (vanilla gelato with a shot of espresso), which was also really good.\n\nAll in all, even though I'm not a huge fan of Italian food, I would definitely recommend this place to anybody, and if, by some chance, I'm in the mood for some Italian, I know Pazzia is the place to go.", "author": "Roy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-04-14", "description": "There's certainly fancier places for Italian food in the city, but when it comes to the sort of everyday Italian that I had the pleasure to eat while living in Europe, you really can't beat Pazzia.\n\nFrom the moment you walk in, it feels like the sort of simple cafe you would find anywhere from Munich down to Firenze... and I've eaten at dozens of these places. Bruschetta, Pizza, Pasta and some simple  secondi (roasted stuffed chicken breasts, mussels in broth, scallopine, etc...) is the name of the game.\n\nWhen you walk in, it's very simple - square tables in a mustard colored square room with only a Monet-esque mural of the Tuscan countryside. As you peek into the open kitchen, you see plates being assembled, pizzas coming out of the ovens and the telltale blue boxes of Barilla pasta.\n\nWhat? Barilla pasta like in the supermarket?\n\nIt's a myth that most Italian restaurants make their own pasta. Even in Italy, most cafes and smaller family restaurants don't have the time, space or skill to be able to produce enough dry pasta to feed their customers, so they find a brand they like and use it and instead focus on the sauces, where the real skill is. \n\nNo offense, but let's face it, dry pasta is water and wheat - it's easy to make a good dry pasta, but almost impossible to make a great dry pasta. Unless you're operating a restaurant known for making your own spaghetti and you're investing an extraordinary amount of cash to get the best pasta maker, equipment, water and flour, it's perfectly acceptable to use a higher grade commercial pasta (De Cecco and Barilla are most common).\n\nI've had Pazzia's simple cuisine twice. The first time, I brought home pizzas, and the fennel sausage was amazing. This time, I went with a Calzone Romana - a perfect dough brushed with olive oil and filled with fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, prosciutto, eggs and parmasan cheese.\n\nAs calzones go, this is one of the hardest ones to make, because the mushrooms and mozzarella will both give off copious amounts of liquid, making it a watery mess that spills out of the calzone shell once opened and makes the bottom of the crust turn into mush. Through a thorough understanding of the dough, the filling materials and the temperature of the ovens, the calzone ended up perfect - with a moist filling, crisp shell and fantastic flavor... and guess what? I cut it open and not a drop of liquid spilled out of the calzone.\n\nFor me, this is the sort of comfortable, every day Italian food that I crave when I think back to Tuscany.", "author": "Avery G."}

Unfortunately, we were all pretty disappointed.\n\nFirst off, when we arrived, our reservation wasn't on the list - the guy running the show (host, manager, etc.) was pretty rude in blaming things on us but after we showed him our call log on the cell phone he suddenly remembered who we were and apologized for forgetting to write down our reservation. He promptly seated us at an outdoor table so that we'd be comfortable as we waited and stated that dessert would be on the house.\n\nWe ordered two pizzas and a salad to share, as well as a bowl of minestrone soup. The waiter came up to us about 3 times during the 10 minutes we took decide what to order and seemed frustrated when we asked for more time each time. Moreover, he wasn't helpful at all when we asked for recommendations or more information about menu items.\n\nWe decided to overlook the waiter's attitude as after all we were there for the food. The bread basket was cold but the bread was very flavorful - there was no fresh cracked pepper in sight. When the soup arrived, they asked if we wanted Parmesan cheese and then proceeded to sprinkle the powder kind that tasted really fake - the soup itself wasn't very flavorful at all. Our pizzas arrived within minutes of the soup along with the salad and we suddenly found ourselves juggling things for space on our table.\n\nThe $9 salad was about one and a half cups of spinach in dressing and a bit of toppings...VERY meager for what you are paying. It looked much like a side salad. Then, the much awaited pizzas were just as disappointing. Granted, most of the crust was pretty thin though in parts it was up to a quarter inch of chewy dough. Then, the sauce, cheese and toppings were only in the center of the pizza with about a 2 inch rim of dough around each pizza. Mind you, these weren't very big pizzas so the majority of it was crust.\n\nEverything just really felt rushed and thrown together. I could see where the pizzas had lots of potential if someone stopped and took an extra 2 minutes to spread the toppings out and make sure the pizza was spun out evenly. Also, I know spinach isn't that expensive so they could have served a bit more of it. I just felt like they didn't care about me and my food as long as they got me in and out FAST. Perhaps their food is better on weekdays but I'm not sure I'll be going back to give Pazzia another try.

We arrived around 7:30pm on a Saturday night and there was a crowd waiting but some were waiting for their carry out meals to take home.   I waited at the front door and upon revealing my lack of reservations was told by the host it would be a 30 minute wait. They had already moved several of their sidewalk tables inside to accommodate the crowd and moved another one in while we waited. We sat outside and enjoyed glasses of wine and people watched.\n\nBeing a non local, it appeared the majority of the clientle were local regulars but we were made to feel welcome throughout our meal.  While outside waiting, two of the wait staff checked with us and they along with our assigned waiter continued to check in on us throughout the meal.  It had a definite New York feel with the tables placed close together.  We both started with the Minestrone which was fresh and tasty although a little cool for my taste.  I enjoyed the Rigatoni con Salsiccia and my favorite dining partner had the chicken with potatoes which I happily sampled also..   \n\nConclusion - A satisfying and delicious meal, friendly and professional service, a place to brings friends, family and business associates.", "author": "Lester R."}

I could barely make my way through the tables to the counter to place my order. Yes it's THAT cramped. \n\nHowever, I'm still giving it 4 stars because of the exceptional service. The waiter guy was really nice to me and even gave me one of their menus to take home. Sure we had to wait another 25 minutes for out take out (why didn't we just wait for a table then?) but the food came out piping hot and was still hot the entire 4-5 blocks home.\n\nI had the fusili w/ eggplant.  It was really good. I like the tomato sauce and at first I thought the portions were kind of small but after finishing the entire entree i was comatose. Hubby had the spicy sausage pizza. He thought it was just ok but I thought it was fantastic. Reminiscent of my favorite NY style pizza. The crust & pie was thin & soft. Not too much tomato sauce and the cheese was delicious.\n\nI would definitely come back but I would recommend making reservations.", "author": "Terry D."}

The bresaola starter is one of my favorites ever.  It's thin slices of dry cured beef served with arugula and flavored with olive oil and lemon.  (By the way, you can buy bresaola at De Lucca's deli on Valencia at 22nd Street... bresaola, arugula, olive oil, lemon cracked black pepper and shaved parmesan and... BAM! you've just made a great starting dish).  \n\nThe spaghetti with clams (vongole) is perfection.  The pizzas are just the way Iike them, very thin crust and straight from the brick oven.

Cozy, warm, open kitchen with real Italian staff , and one charming owner (Massimo) whose middle name should be \"amore~\" - no frills or attitudes, which I tire of at some of the \"in\" restaurants.  The thin crust pizza is paper thin and irrisistable in every bite in every style.  (Just be aware of how many slices you chomp through before realizing that it is still pizza, not garden salad on soy crackers.)  A lot of us never get past the pizzas on the menu because they're so tasty and light.\n\nIt's a great stop over to and from the baseball games (when in season) and also a perfect solution for a bite before heading over to the W or St. Regis for drinks.

I have to say that we both liked the pizza a lot at Pazzia. \n\nBut first, we got an appetizer that needed help. I think it was a tomato salad with anchovies. Here's the thing, if the tomatoes aren't good, say kinda white and mealy, how about you don't serve the dang thing and offer something else? No one's gonna enjoy a mealy tomato, no matter how much you dress it. \n\nSo then on to the pizza. My husband got the Gorgonzola and I got the mushroom pizza. The crust was incredibly thin and crispy with the trademark bulbous, charred crusty edges that comes from a wood-fired oven. His Gorgonzola pizza had melted, obscene amounts of oozy, gooey, sinful goodness floating around and pooling in the center of his pie. Mine was sprinkled heavily with white mushrooms and paired with a nice tomato sauce. I would have liked however for the the variety of mushrooms to have been better on my pie. I think that may be a product of my being spoiled from living in Northern California.  But all in all, we liked Pazzia for the really tasty pizza. \n\nFor the atmosphere, it was kinda family like. Clearly the owner dude knew people or had friends stopping in all the time. As far as the service, I've read some of the reviews already posted and I kinda agree that you shouldn't expect much when you come here. They clearly do not have a host/hostess/front of house manager and instead rely on the servers/owner. That could be their downfall, plus we kinda noticed that when we left, people were starting to get overlooked as far as getting seated goes. Word to the wise, get there early and you might get lucky and get the pizza for sure.", "author": "cora j."}

I personally heart the cream sauced porcini mushroom pasta, because it just simply rocks.\n\nBread is awesome, though I do wish they would serve it on a place so you could mix the balsamic vin and olive oil together for a more \"blended\" feel.\n\nWine list is great but the thing I think I love MOST about Pazzia is the great welcoming environment you get when you walk in.

We split the mussels in tomato sauce as an appetizer (cannot remember the name of the dish for the life of me) and a pizza with mozzarella, olives, artichoke hearts, prosciutto and mushrooms.\n\nThe mussels were good.  I don't think they were P.E.I. but they were perfectly acceptable, tasty and not overcooked.  The pizza was delicious as well.  It was a very thin crust and had ample toppings.  My preference would have been for just a hair thicker base crust without losing the 'thin crust' status but there was nothing bad about it.  The toppings were all fresh and high quality.  There was no trace of the pie to be found at the end of the meal.\n\nNo wine but we finished off the meal with a nice espresso.

Back in 2005, Russ described Pazzia as \"...a pretty small place that seems to be not well known yet.\"\n\nTimes have changed.  With 4 stars over 237 reviews and nary a night when the place isn't packed, I think it's fair to say Pazzia has come a long way.  As far as I can tell the food has always been best of class, and it seems they've managed to persist the small - almost family-small - atmosphere.  In this department it's the little stuff that helps: the hand-written specials menu, the ever-present owner in a stylish suit taking turns talking to and occasionally sitting with his customers, the closely-placed tables.  Wonderful atmosphere.\n\nI'm not well-enough versed in Italian cuisine to know if Pazzia represents a particular region, but whatever it is, they've got it nailed.  On this most recent visit I had the hand-made spinach taglierine with pancetta in a white wine sauce and it was liberating.  You see, through some fluke of nature I developed an early aversion to long, thin pastas; only by steadily applied effort and the art of places like Pazzia have I learned to overcome this crippling affliction.  To top it off our achingly cute waitress made an entirely reasonable wine suggestion that paired nicely.\n\n5 stars all around.\n\nBe aware that it can get decently loud, especially if you're at one of the middle tables that doesn't have at least one edge to the wall.

My pizza was tasty but I think Amici's does a better job.  My wife had the pomodori salad which was very good and plentiful.  Two could probably split this one.  I had vanilla ice cream in expresso.

It could be that or something triggers the childhood memory of Friday night pizza and TGIF television. Either way, I like pizza; especially good pizza. \n\nI checked out Pazzia with a friend while visiting SF. It was right down the street from my hotel and it sounded promising. Plus it had pizza on the menu which was a good enough treat for me because while I have a love for pizza, I don't eat it as often as I wish I could. When we arrived, the restaurant had people in it and they seated us at a table in the back. It's not a huge restaurant and it had a homey feel with the warmth of the oven toasting up the room. The Cesar Salad was good and it had a hint of mustard to it which is a taste you're not expecting with a Cesar Salad but it wasn't necessarily bad. In fact, it actually started to grow on me with every bite. The pizza was phenomenal. It was thin crust but gooey and chewy all at the same time. The cheese oozed and melted in my mouth. The olives, sausage and mushrooms were fresh and filled with taste. It definitely didn't taste like an average Joe pizza parlor pie. \n\nNow, if this review was just based on the food, I would have easily given it a four, but with every restaurant experience comes the service as well. The service started out great. The waitress greeted us right away and brought us water and asked us for our beverage order. But, slowly (literally) it turned ... well, slow. It especially turned into a snail's pace service after we were finished with our meal and our drinks. We sat there for about 25 minutes (at least) before the waitress brought us our check. When I looked around to see what was causing the holdup, I saw them standing around in the back. Everyone seemed to have their food and while it was populated, it wasn't jam packed, so I'm not sure why the service was so incredibly slow. \n\nSo in summary, the pizza goodness and cheese lingering on my taste buds wanted to give this a four, but the service and wait lowered it to a three.", "author": "Lindsey D."}

When I tried to let the waitress know I was just trying to help she proceeded to raise her voice at me and told me I wasn't supposed to be helping myself to the menus and that I'd picked up the wrong menus and she was sorry but she was the only one working and is busy.  What her eyes were telling me was:\n\n\"Who the hell do you think you are getting up and doing my job for me.  Go back to your table and sit down before I really get angry.

By all accounts (I've never actually been to Italy), this place is authentic; and, more importantly, just damn good.  How lucky am I that since I live across the street, I can walk over and get take-out pretty much any night I want?  If you've ever been there for dinner and saw a brown dude walk in in sweats to pick up take-out, that was me.\n\nIt's a total hole in the wall, neighbourhood restaurant.  Tables are pretty much right on top of each other, service can be, well, european (read: slow, but constantly in motion), and you have to kind of cut into the kitchen area to go to the bathroom.  But the food, oh the food... fantastic thin crust pizzas (as an east coaster, I love the thin crust pizza.  Enough already with the big doughy impostor Californians call pizza), lasagna in bechamel,  I could go on and on.  The wine list isn't terribly extensive, but it has everything you would look for at an Italian place (Chianti, Sangiovese, etc.), and all reasonably priced.  And on those rare evenings in Soma when it isn't windy or cold, the outside seating is a God send.\n\nAlso, rumor has it that Massimo is opening a wine bar in the space next door.  Massimo himself has been propagating this rumor for at least 6 months, so I'm sure -- a little like the service some times -- he'll get around to it eventually :-)", "author": "Maneesh B."}

Well, this was my friend, Brian's pick and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  If you love homemade pasta, soft french rolls and great wine, check it out.  I read the other reviews, and have to say I agree with most; it is a very small restaurant (but they are expanding), with great service and a friendly atmosphere.  There is a parking lot right next door (paid lot), so it is conveniently located.  We had 5:30 reservations and were seated immediately. We ordered a variety of dishes and shared; here's what we liked:  We started with salads; Caprese, beet and then an apple and blue cheese, respectively.  The beet salad was deemed the best.  Moving on, we sampled the pizzas...if you come here for one reason only, come for the pizza; they are light on the crust and full of flavorful toppings and a wonderful sauce.  For entrees:  I had the tortelloni, filled with braised beef, served in a cream sauce with mushrooms that was wonderful.  My companions had the rigatoni (deemed very good), veal (which I don't eat, but my dinner companion enjoyed very much) and fettuccine with asparagus and prawns in a white wine sauce (again, a winner).  We finished off with the Tiramisu, which they are noted for, and the lemon cake.  There were raves over the Tiramisu; it was light and flavorful, and I thought the lemon cake was the perfect way to finish the meal.  Overall, this is a great place for authentic Italian cuisine.

I'm not a fan unless it's the cheap, questionable meat source type on pizza hut pizza.  \n\nRob has taught me: I like to see the meat part of the meat, not the conglomerate ground of anything is possible.\n\nPlus side: they did remove it from the nasty casing before grilling it so it resembled lumps of ground meat and not sliced up tubes of meat.

The mushrooms were tender and I ate all of that.\n\nTori got the margherita pizza.  I would have like to see some basil on it, some fresh mozzerella.  Louis got the arugala and proscuitto pizza.  He was well satisfied at the portion though he made a comment about wishing that they baked the proscuitto on the pizza instead of laying it on top afterwards (he's secretly wishing for bacon).

Secondo : I speak Italiano . Terza : I visited and ate pizza at the Pantheon of La Pizza Cultura : the Vomero neighborhood in Napoli.  Pizza was born there; it was defined there; and after you eat it there, you can expire in peace. The most cogent historic phrase that comes to mind : \" See Napoli and die ! \"\n\nThe Pizza here is absolutely \" Pazzia\" ( Craziness, Mushuggah ), in its quality, color , presentation and provenance. What shines the most , is the CRUST !!\nIt's the hardest element to get right and at Pazzia, it's \" molto Italiano\" : slightly burnt, super thin, and hint of smokiness on the tongue.  I like the traditional Margherita ( justa' sauce pomodoro ), but they do all the traditional toppings with aplomb.  Try the Quattro Stagione ( 4 seasons ) or the Al Funghi ( mushrooms ).In sum, all the pies have the Neopolitan quality.\n\nThe culture of the place screams of Tuscany. You are greeted warmly ; if known you get a double cheek kiss -- man or woman.  The Italians who run the place recreate an nice original experience-- cheaper than flying to Florence.  Once seated you get to take in the exuberant impressionistic murals of  The Cinque Terre ( in Liguria, artist : Sassone ) and view the energetic sud-Americano chefs working hard behind the counter.\n\nThis is a wonderful lunch experience, perhaps before MOMA ( 2 blocks north), as you can eat outdoors getting the benefit of the afternoon sun. At night, after 7pm, there is easy free parking ( try 3rd St or Harrison).\n\nIn addition to pizza, the diner will also be treated to wonderful tuscan trattoria food, at very fair prices.  \n\nEvviva and buon appetito !", "author": "Jon H."}

Our dinner experience got off to a terrible start when, instead of seating us at the first open, cleaned and set table (for which we had already been waiting for 10 minutes out in the cold), the waiter had us wait, and wait, and . . . wait. Minutes later, another table opened up, was cleaned and set (first still sitting empty). Minutes tick by. A third table opens, was cleaned and set (now all three are empty). Each of these tables could have sat our party of two. We were finally seated at the last table. Mind you, it wasn't that they were saving these tables for reservations, as one of them remained open for the entirety of our meal and the other one was seated by another walk-in. Any good restaurant should know better than to piss off its paying customers by making them wait for no particular reason for a table that wasn't any different than the other ones. \n\nMore importantly, the food was decidedly mediocre. I wanted pasta, but given all the poor yelp reviews of the pasta, I went with a pizza that I could not pronounce. Caraccio or something. It had olives on it. Olives with pits. Really? Pits? How are we supposed to navigate that  while eating your soggy, droopy pizza without losing a filling? \n\nBut the most disappointing part of the pizza was the crust. It simply tasted like crispy flour. In other words, it was tasteless. \n\nAll in all, the place had mediocre food, had terrible wait staff, was so loud that you had to holler to carry a conversation, and was overpriced ($32 for our two pizzas). Like I said before, you're best advised to keep driving.", "author": "A H."}

I had risotto with shellfish, which was very good, but $18. Kind of wish I'd gotten one of the nice pizza's though, because the risotto was a little small. I understand shellfish is pricey, but they didn't need to skimp on the rice. Anyway, the ambiance was nice. A group of 7, like I was with, was about the limit for the space - small little storefront dining area - and the ambiance was a little loud. It had a pretty hip feel to it though and was good to see the owner working the room. I'd go back for a group dinner or special occassion.\n\n----------\nI went back recently and had a pizza.

I had a bit of a conundrum when ordering because I couldn't decide between the pasta with shrimp and asparagus, the risotto with shellfish, or the beef lasagna. I finally went with the lasagna and a side of asparagus. The lasagna, which came individually made in its own ceramic dish, had a tomato cream sauce which made it one of the best lasagnas I've ever had. The asparagus came steamed with a light drizzle of olive oil and was just perfect. I recommend the house red as well. I'm no wine connoisseur, but I thought this wine went well with my meal. The tiramisu -- one of my favorite desserts so I always have to give it a try -- did not disappoint. \n\nI was a little disappointed with the rolls that came with the meal. I was hoping for crusty bread instead of soft rolls. Also, only olive oil was offered -- where was the balsamic?\n\nThe restaurant itself is on the small side, so when it's crowded, the noise level can be on the loud side.

The minestrone soup was one of the better minestrone's I've had, the salad with candied walnuts and pears left a bit more to be desired, but the proscuitto/olive/artichoke pizza was very good. Reading other people's reviews, I would like to try the pasta if I went again. \n\nOne thing I would suggest though, if you do happen to try this place out is don't try to pronounce the names of what's on the menu unless you speak Italian or it's something very easy like \"ravioli\". My boyfriend and I tried to order a pizza and we got some cheese on tomato thing that looked very odd. Then proceeded to have to do the awkward \"I don't think that's what I ordered\" thing and the waitress did not look happy with us.

We shared a bunch of pastas - the tortelloni special, with beef and mushrooms in a sherry cream sauce, the fettucini special with prawns and asparagus, and the rigatoni con salsicce.  All were amazing, but I think the rigatoni may have edged out the competition a bit.  The caprese salad looked amazing, but I didn't get to try it because some hot, feisty redhead fought me off.

We made reservations for dinner on Friday night and were very promptly seated upon arriving.

However, upon entering the restaurant, we realized that the con of eating in a small restaurant is the very high noise level that tends to affect the level of conversation one can have. There were more \"what did you say?\" than I've ever had in a conversation at dinner. Additionally, we were seated in front of the door which was open, which naturally meant we would feel the draft.

To our amazement we were promptly seated at our waiting table ( we called to tell them to move our reservation because we were arriving an hour! late- this they fully accomodated! ) The menu had wonderful offerings and judging from the camp seated next to us- looked delicious and satisfying as well! Given that we were going to be  bar hopping after- we just ordered the Pizza Margherita and the Seafood Risotto. \nThe Pizza was quite generous- crisp and thin crust- it arrived hot with melted fine Italian mozzarella- and just enough tomato/ basil sauce. \nThis is truly the best Italian Neapolitan style pizza in the city!!!\nThe risotto was just right- and not  too starchy- the saffron was buttery and brought out the freshness and sweetness from the scallop and shrimp seasoned with fine Italian parsley for added zing factor.  \nSince we were feeling the festive nature of the evening and from our surroundings- we rounded it off with their Prosecco Italian Sparkling wine and the Tiramisu Delizioso!!!  Thanks again to our waitress- who gave us (yes gratis) two glasses of Muscat because they were out of the Port!  \nI was so ecstatic about the dinner I would have shouted like Roberto Benigni..Grazie!

I was told that the family who runs this place also has a restaurant in Florence- I'd say that explains the authenticity with their food.  Very fresh, very yummy, and reasonably priced- I try to go there whenever I'm in the area, and it's well worth the trip.  Next time I'll save room for dessert :-)", "author": "Tina P."}

The crust doesn't absorb the flavor of the great toppings.  I didn't order any pasta but the tiramisu really is that good!  We had a huge group of almost 20 people and the service was great.  You know how it is with a big group, no one ever knows what they want and someone is always missing from the table.  The waitstaff was very patient with us.  Massimo is quite a character.  He arrived towards the end of our meal and danced to the music as he greeted diners.  He's a sweet funny guy!", "author": "Jeanne C."}

We were a relatively large group (read: automatic 18% tip) and the waitress had no qualms about trying to rush us out the door.  She brought only 3 menus for 7 people and when she came back to take our order, she was visibly annoyed despite the fact that half the table did not even have menus.  When she came back to take our order, she looked huffy again and when I started to order my entree, she said, \"so you are not having a salad? I am taking appetizer orders\".  I was a bit confused, and then she moved on to the next person, who ordered a salad and entree, an order which she happily accepted. The next person ordered an appetizer and entree as well, so then I asked her if it was appropriate for me to order my pizza. She told me to hold on until she got the rest of the table. Finally, I repeated my pizza order and asked her if she could take my order now. Again, she looked at me as if I was crazy, but wrote down my order.  It was bizarre, unnecessarily confusing and rude. \n\nThe restaurant was unbelievably loud and there ended up being a miscommunication of one of the orders at my table, a pasta had shown up instead of a pizza.  The waitress was insistent that my friend had ordered the wrong dish and that she had written down what he had said.  She made no apologies and got the manager to back her up. Again, strange, not what you would call good customer service.  \n\nThe pizza is decent, but I can't accept the mediocre service. 2 stars.", "author": "Marie K."}

Unfortunately, I didn't pay heed to the negative feedback which I found to be pretty much on target. When we arrived, we stood around waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. The host/mgr passed us by a few times without saying anything more than \"excuse me\". There were 3 tables for 4 people available inside - NONE with reservation notices upon them though later we were told that they were reserved.\n\nAfter waiting a few minutes, we ventured inside all the way to the kitchen/food counter to try to get someones attention (one of the 4 or 5 wait staff/host/mgr) --again we waited for another few minutes. Finally, my wife asked the host/mgr if we were to seat ourselves and he spoke to her with a look and attitude like \"Oh! (No way!) We just don't DO that here! Mind you, he did not say these words, but that is the attitude that her conveyed. Some people might call it a charming Euro/Italian attitude, I call it STUCK UP!\n\nThe host/mgr ushered my wife out and asked us to wait on these chairs lined up against the windows outside (one of them was broken and an accident waiting to happen - I hope their liability insurance is current). He told me that a table was finishing up and paying and it would by about 5 minutes -- he indicated which table in their crammed together and small dining room. We waited about 10 minutes then I saw the table order dessert. Meanwhile 2 parties came to the restaurant and were seated immediately. One party appeared to know the host mgr and was given the table of their choice, the other party seemed to just saunter up and ask for a table. I, standing right next to them and the waitress, heard her ask how many in the party -- then she proceeded to seat them. SHE DID NOT ASK IF THEY HAD A RESERVATION.\n\nSeeing my confusion, the waitress came out to me and said that our table will be coming up soon and these parties had reservations (a seeming half truth based on my accounting above). Wanting clarification because of what I was told and what I was seeing, I asked her \"Are you sure? Because we were told that our wait would be about 5 minutes and it's been 20\". She said the table is paying now and it wouldn't be much longer. Then she went back in. I saw no \"payment activity\" going on inside the restaurant. She came back out with the menu and wine list for us to review which I accepted. She went back in and whispered something to the host/mgr and he came out to \"deal\" with me. Mind you, I did not raise my voice or express any harsh feelings, I just clarified the situation.\n\nThe host/mgr comes out to ask \"What is the issue?\". I replied that there is no issue, I was just clarifying what our expectation was. He then launches into an excited accented tirade, speaking over whatever I have to say, of how he is not trying to keep us and we are free to go, other parties had reservations, and a few other words that were disjointed and misplaced. Some people might call this a charming authentic accent, I call it INCOHERENT BABBLING THAT IS MEANT TO DISTRACT AND CONFUSE TO GIVE ONE A CHANCE TO WALK AWAY THINKING THAT HE REALLY TOLD SOMEONE OFF AND WON AN ARGUMENT.\n\nOf course, I was not arguing but apparently, this guy had a reason to defend himself  - apparently his own lies. \n\nWe waited a few minutes more, saw our table vacate, then we voted with our feet and wallet and left this very BAD ATTITUDE AND BAD SERVICE Restaurant.", "author": "A S."}

We ordered a couple of plates from the specials menu and were excited about what was to come; until it came.  My girlfriend got prawn linguini (pardon the spelling) in white wine sauce.  I'm almost absolutely sure that there wasn't a drop of white wine in the dish at all.  Here was however, far too much oil and the bottom of the dish was a warm puddle of it.  The pasta was overcooked, as was the shrimp (these 4 little things aren't worthy of being considered prawns).  They also didn't even bother to properly clean the shrimp, so we had to \"de-vein\" them ourselves.  The pasta also included asparagus, which, like everything else, was far too overcooked.  The dish tasted like noodles and olive oil, and nothing else....\n\nI got a chicken breast stuffed with cheese and Prosciutto.  The chicken was so overcooked that I had a difficult time getting my fork and knife into to it to cut it.  They attempted to cook the chicken so that the top and bottom were crispy, but it failed as they obviously left it cooking for too long.... so long that the cheese and Prosciutto inside were far from discernable.  The chicken was accompanied with broccoli and potato wedges, which, you guessed it, were overcooked.  There was a thick sauce with the chicken...sort of a marsala sauce I suppose, but it lacked any redeeming qualities.\n\nThe service was typical.  The staff didn't return shortly after giving us our dishes to ask if everything was okay (something that any decent wait person has the sense to do---because if something isn't, it's the best time to remedy it.  \n\nWe were both bummed out that we wasted a meal and the money on this dinner.  Should have gone to whole foods hot food bar instead.  \n\nI hate to leave a bad review, but what I hate even more is wasting money and a meal on poorly prepared food.", "author": "Will T."}

On that same visit, I ordered the pizza and have never gone back--truly the only pizza I've ever had outside of Europe that tastes authentically Italian. I'm a sucker for the margherita pizza--it's absolutely delicious (and afordable at ~$10).

We ordered a cold cuts antipasta, a braised green salad, lasagna (baked in a deep dish that looks like the kind served at Pizza Hut), home-made tiramisu, cappuchino, Americano, and 3 glasses of wine plus tip, the bill for two came to $100+. Though the food was good, I won't go back there because of the wine prices. Plus, I've found Italian restaurants that are faster, just as delicious or more so, quieter, in a nicer neighborhood, with delicious wines, all for 30 percent cheaper.", "author": "Lou S."}

The restaurant accepts reservations, which is a huge plus for a party of six like ours; however, we lucked out and were seated right away even without a reservation (twenty minutes later that would not have happened).   If you like lasagna, and like me prefer the sauce to be heavy on the cream by all means order the lasagna.  The staff was professional and patient with us while we mulled over our choices and aptly helped us select two excellent red wines for our dinner.  Once served, the staff was quick to refill our glasses of water, soda, etc.. but let us eat our own pace.  My only recommendations for improvement would be portable heaters for outdoors and having vinegar and spices to accompany the olive oil served with the bread.", "author": "John G."}

The food was average at best and his demeanor was disgraceful.  As a Stanford suma cum laude graduate and as a Silicon Valley veteran with over a decade, I was still treated as an early 20-something child, my date was literally undressed with his rudeness, eyes, and attitude.  My date and I were in a serious discussion throughout the night when he repeatedly interrupted and exclaimed repeatedly how fantastic she looked and shook my hand awkwardly each time.  What a terrible place to take a date.  A terrible place to go thinking a cute italian place is what you'll discover.  A terrible experience with poor english equipped clientele.  If you have something between small and medium range in cost, have some education or taste as I do, avoid this place like the plague if you want your date undressed and underserved.  The food isn't mediocre.  The owner still may give you a free shot of limoncello as I've seen him undress women with his eyes.", "author": "Cayman C."}

But once you get past this unlikely facade, you enter into a lovely and friendly environment.  The staff creates a welcoming atmosphere, and makes you feel right at home. This place gots to be good, cause you can hear some of the patrons speaking in the Italian tongue... man, if they like it... then you know you're in the right spot....  Sit down, order yourself a Peroni, and start with one of their pizzas... I'm a sucker for Mahgerita pizza... and they do it well here.  And then from there you have an endless choice of pastas and other hearty entrees.  You can not go wrong.  And what's great about this place is that it's priced incredibly.  You'd think that you'd shell out $30-$40 a person for a meal of this quality (that's before even the alcohol)... but ya' don't....  So good, that I'm gonna celebrate my b-day this weekend with my friends there... Happy Birthday to me!", "author": "Dale K."}

She quickly arranged a table outside for us and we were seated. She came back after only a few minutes and took our orders. What a great start.......The other waitress brought out our food, the linguini vongole we ordered with extra sauce came out dry without any sauce. I picked up a slice of mushroom pepperoni pizza and found the bottom crust pale in color. I took a bite and the pizza tasted doughy and it was completely undercooked. The veal scallopine was fair, and the veal chop was the only dish that was completely eaten clean off the plate. We left $110.00 dollars including a 10% tip, 3/4 of a plate of uneaten clams w/linguini, and 3 & 1/2 of the four slices of undercooked pizza crust. I deducted 10% tip for the rude waitress who brought out our food and was not very helpful in fixing our problems. I expected a little better experience for $25.00 per person.", "author": "Gene L."}

Its thin crust and great. I love the carpaccio.  When you call for a reservation (it helps if its busy and you can all like 30m before you show up) they say buona sera which I think is great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-09-11", "description": "The best thing about Pazzia is the generous scoop of vanilla gelato. I've been to Pazzia twice, once for lunch and once again for dinner. The roasted chicken and potatoes I ordered for lunch packed a salty, oily flavor wallop, which was great if you're not looking for delicate perfection. I wasn't, so I was satisfied, until I eyed my coworker's gorgonzola pizza. I am enamored of gorgonzola pizza, so I swiftly returned, this time for dinner. My companion's pricey pasta special with crab wasn't at all what he expected, and his report was that it was overpriced and underpromised. I was also a tad disappointed with my pizza. It had either lost a lot of heat in preparation or had never had much to begin with and felt heavy and soggy beneath the gorzongola. The cheese was perhaps the wrong brand choice or too plentiful for the combination, resulting in a sharp taste of stinky cheese without any other flavor balance or nuance to round it out. I'd return to Pazzia for lunch on someone else's dime; otherwise, I'll be holding out for my Italian inspiration. I've had enough excellent 'zola pizzas in Italy not to confuse this for the real thing.", "author": "Jessica D."}

This place is a real gem with autherntic and traditional italian food overseen by the Florentine owner Massimo in a truly italian atmospere with true italian waiters who a freindly and efficient.  50% of my italian friends claim it's the best italian pizza in SF,  the other 50% prefer Tomossos.  I  most recently ate here last week after a visit to the MOMA.  We were able to just walk in and grab a table on a Thurs night without a reservation (I think were lucky because the place was packed).  We shared mussles in a tomato sauce and a nice bottle of Barolo.  For the main course I had the lamb in chianti, rosemary sauce and it was delicious and a big portion 3 good sized chops.  My date had the veal scollopini with porcini mushrooms and capers which was also quite tasty.  For dessert we had tiramisu and cappucinos that were very very good. Mine even had a heart on it out of the milk.   This is a cozy neighborhood place that you can always count on for a good authentic italian meal.", "author": "Melanie -."}
