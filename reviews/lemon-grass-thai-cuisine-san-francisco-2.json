The service is quick and you get generous portions of whatever it is you order that I guarantee will fill you up. As for quality, it's not gourmet by any means but it isn't too pedestrian either. With five friends dining here, after sampling everything family style, I'd strongly recommend the green curry with chicken if you end up here.

But if not the worst service I've ever in my life experienced it ranks the next one to the worst. \n\nTo be fair, they were probably down a server tonight -  I am pretty sure it was a bus-person that took our order and bussed the tables.\n\nThey seem far more focused on their take-out business than on their in-house clientele.  In fact, the food is good enough that we may never set foot in the restaurant again - but may order delivery.\n\nService was slow.  We got the initial drinks we ordered but not the second order (but weren't charged - so they got that right).  After the appetizers there were couples that were seated, ate their meal, paid and left before someone came and asked if we were ready for our main course!  When we were done, with all the obvious signs of being done - napkins off our laps and on the table, silver ware appropriately off the table and on the plates, plates moved aside etc.  it was impossible to get anyone to come give our check.  Even the clue of a credit card on the table was to no avail.\n\nEventually, I gave up and went up to the lady at the cash register (who was attending to many screens from companies like GrubHub) to pay and get our leftovers packaged.  And *still* it took a long time to finish checking out.  They insisted on packaging our leftovers - even though I would have been glad to do so.  After I'd paid and waited ten minutes or so, I was about to walk out of the restaurant without our leftovers when they finally were handed to us.\n\nSummary:  Great food.  At least tonight - worst service ever.  Maybe they should become a deliver-only restaurant :-)", "author": "Brian B."}

Will warn you that the food isn't really that authentic and it's not super tasty, but it is a great spot to get fed a ton of food for under $15.\n\nAll of the mains on their menu (everything from curries to stir fries to noodle dishes etc) is around $12, with a lot clocking in at $10. Their appetizers range from a few dollars to $14 for a sample platter, and their soups are $6-$7.\n\nWith prices like this you'd imagine that the portions would be stingy, but our table really over ordered this philosophy. I opted for a papaya salad and a bowl of Tom Yum soup and had to leave half the salad on the table- others in the group tried the hot beef salad and shrimp pad thai.

I appreciate that it's not overly sweet like other places. I like the red curry duck. The duck imparts a gamier flavor to the curry and they do a good job of not overcooking the duck to where it is really tough. Nice rich and fatty flavor. The chicken yellow curry is a nice choice if you're looking for a less spicy curry. Nice variety of stir fry dishes too especially seafood and veggies. Order the appetizer combo to start if you want a little of everything. I like the fried veggie spring rolls for textural contrast. Also make sure to add on a side of the bright cucumber salad to break up all the wonderful curries. \n\nLemongrass Thai Cuisine is a safe choice for a group but also has a few surprises in the menu to keep things fresh.", "author": "Jon L."}

We used to go to LG more often  at its original location years back when it became known as \"the\" Thai place to go to.  Haven't gone as often, but when we have it's been fine. We got some food to go last night.  Some dishes were a hit, and I even had to finish off the salad first thing this morning because it was so tasty (I almost got out of bed in the middle of the night to eat it). The Tom Kha Gai soup was a little too white and wanted more depth, but it was good.  Veggie dish with pea pods--yum.  Duck fried rice--yum (and I normally don't care for duck). The dish that was a problem was the egg rolls.  They were spoiled.  And I knew something was off even as we were walking out the door of the restaurant. I could smell spoilage.  But as luck would have it, my companion said I was wrong and he was sure things would be good, and I just gave in and said okay. Back home, as we removed the containers from the bag, the kitchen filled with the smell of the spoiled dish.  It was the group of three egg rolls in a carton.  The restaurant kitchen actually sliced the middle roll down its center for presentation.  How could they not have known that there was something wrong?  I find it impossible to believe that, between the person who cooked the food, the person who boxed it, the person who placed the bag out on the table where carry-outs were waiting, and the cashier, someone didn't detect the spoiled smell.  I also can't help but wonder if they were giving the freshest egg rolls to customers who were dining in and the older rolls to to-go customers, so only to-go customers had spoiled rolls that they, like us, didn't want to be bothered going back to LG to return, or if even some people in the dining room had bad rolls.  The egg rolls weren't that expensive.  But we did spend over sixty bucks for a meal whose appetizer was immediately tied up in a compost bag.  We'll give it another try, and if it's all good we'll go back again--if not, never again.  Every now and then any restaurant can goof up.", "author": "E C."}

The fried egg rolls came out very fast and was just ok it could've been hotter. It just didn't taste fresh. I think it may had been a mistake order given that it came out fairly fast. Then we waited and waited for our entrees. We probably waited for about 30 minutes + for a pale looking pad see ew. It tasted ok and was probably the best dish tonight. I love pad see ew so I'm generally not very picky about it. This was mediocre. My husbands curry fried rice lacked flavor and only tasted a bit of spice other than that it tasted like plain rice. The waitress didn't apologize for the wait until we were given the check. If the food was pretty good I would probably come back but based on tonight's experience we won't be coming back.", "author": "Tinker B."}

They did not have any other table, but everything took a while to get, especially the check.  Having worked in a restaurant, I was very forgiving of the service cause I assumed they lacked the training.  When they brought us the check, and I mean, they did not bring an itemized check or we had given our credit card first.  Again, being a waiter, I was sympathetic and left 15% (thats what I do for generally bad service).   However, when I asked if gratuity was included, they said yes.  It floored me because they charged me a tip already and I was going to give them another 15%.  Double tipping is a pitiful way to charge the customer double tips, leading to the waiter actually profiting, even if they did not provide good service. That is why they did not provide an itemized receipt.   \n\nI am going to give it 2 starts and not 1 because I am assuming the owner discourages double-tipping and cares about his customers. Yet, the waitresses were well aware of what they were doing.", "author": "Dishar R."}

I, of course, sat at a table with the sofa seating and the armrest.  \n\nWe both ordered from the combination rice plates. $8.75 and you get to pick two items out of 6 choices. Comes with rice. \n\nI ordered the chicken satay with pad pak ruammit (sauteed mixed vegetables with bean sauce) - two pieces of chicken satay which was probably the best thing I had at this place. Although you get a lot of veggies, it was sauteed in msg. It was very salty and I was dying of thirst 2 hours later. I did like the little sauce plate that held peanut sauce and tiny pieces of celery. \n\nMy friend ordered the chicken satay also and the Kang Karee with Chicken (A mild yellow curry with chicken, coconut milk,  potatoes, and onions) - The yellow curry was watered down. \n\nBefore our entrees arrived we were each given a small salad.

They probably kept this from being a 1 star review.\n\nWe ordered the tom yum soup, satay chicken, pad thai, and 2 curries:\n\nThe soup was decent, but it was mostly undercooked vegetables and had very little actual soup in it. The soup that was there was only decent, lacking in flavor.\n\nThe satay chicken was particularly underwhelming. The seasoning didn't taste like satay chicken, and the chicken itself was tough to bite off the stick.\n\nThe pad thai continued the trend of having too many undercooked vegetables accompanying the plate. The noodles themselves were oily, and, while the entire dish tasted like pad thai, it was far from great.\n\nThe curries were actually not that bad, but they were also pretty generic. Another user mentioned that the curries didn't have the perfect spice blends that make Thai cuisine great, and they seemed to be spot on. The curries were pretty watery and were something that could have been made at home.

It was so sweet I actually couldn't eat it, but I did end up bringing it home and dousing it in sriracha and lime juice which made it slightly better. Maybe their other veggie options are better?", "author": "Alexandra E."}

The service was nice and since the restaurant wasn't exactly hopping we were taken care of promptly.\nWe started with an appetizer of Mieng-Kum which was one of the most interesting and flavorful Thai appetizers I've ever had.

I lovelovelove a good green curry and this was not the place for it. Though neither dish was bad, neither was that great. We both ordered medium spicy and for what we got we assumed the waitress heard us say \"no spice whatsoever\". Both dishes offered a ton of meat and veggies, though my biggest complaint was that they used standard eggplant in the green curry rather than the expected Thai eggplant. So what I ended up with was a bunch of mushy, and frankly, disgusting slices of the stuff. That ruined the whole meal for me. \nThe red curry was just ok. It had an odd, though not necessarily earthy flavor we couldn't recognize.\nWe didn't bother with dessert. \nI seriously recommend finding another Thai restaurant if in this area.

It did taste much better two days later as leftovers.\n\nPLA-MUK-KRA-TIEM  - calamari sauteed in garlic and black pepper.  Good.  Very simple nice flavor.\n\nPOH-PIER-SOD - an appetizer of a rice paper roll stuffed with tofu, cucumber, snow peas, carrots and topped with sweet and sour tamarind sauce.  I thought the rice paper was thick but soft, perhaps a bit too 'doughy'.  \n\nService was good.  The interior is on the medium-small side, but out of all the other surrounding restaurants on Polk street, this one had no wait.

I ordered on a Friday night a little after 7pm and was given a 50 minute delivery estimate. After waiting for more than an hour I called the restaurant to see if they had sent a driver. Someone picked up the phone but didn't ever say anything. I waited thinking maybe I missed them asking me to hold, but after listening to the noise in the restaurant for a few minutes I hung up. From there I reached out to Eat24 and after some waiting was told he'd be there in 10 minutes. 15 minutes pass and I ask again. There wasn't a quick answer and now that we'd been waiting almost an hour we finally get a call from the driver. He said he had already stopped by once but no one had called either from the front door to be buzzed in or called my phone directly. He said he then left made another delivery and then would be at my building in 5 minutes and could I meet him out front. I did go out to pick up that food, but after waiting almost 2 hours I was definitely hangry, picking up food that was now cold and only received a $5 discount. We ordered the Pad Thai spicy which cold as one big lump of noodles is not great and there wasn't much spice to it either. We also ordered the Gai Kraprow with chicken, but there wasn't much chicken - mostly onions & bamboo shoots. Also cold when delivered.", "author": "Joy A."}

Vernon).  REAL Thai food, not Chinese-like Thai food.  Daughter, from Japan, however, agreed that this restaurant was sub-par.\n\nWe had been recommended this restaurant by a Fisherman's Wharf-hotel concierge with 35 years experience.  We were happy with the decor and the waitresses's outfits, both which looked relatively authentic.  So we were optimistic.  We should have, however, been afraid when we asked for 1 star on one of the dishes and the waitress looked really puzzled and said that they don't serve the food spicy.\n\nWe started out with the Appetizer Combination.  This was pretty good, actually.  And nicely presented.  However, it was more for two, not for three or more.\n\nWe then shared some Tom Kha chicken.  Not bad.  But almost raw mushrooms.  And no other vegetables.  Just chicken and mushrooms.\n\nThen, our main dishes.  Phad Thai with absolutely no veggies whatsoever!  And no spiciness, which is how daughter had ordered it.  But the Phad See Ew beef was absolutely not spicy even though we'd asked for 2 stars.  Hubby needed hot sauce.  It wasn't bad, but just wasn't up to the level of phad see ew in the Seattle area.  My beef with vegetables dish was not only super salty (or, I suspect, had MSG), but the large amount of Chinese greens in it (which I'd never seen ever before in Thai dishes) were uncut and, even after chewing on it for awhile, almost choked on it.  In any case, this was definitely NOT Thai food; it was Chinese food attempting to be Thai.  (While not so bad as the Almond Fried Chicken days of Spokane, in comparison, it seemed so.)\n\nTo top it all off, the service was also rather lackluster.  No one advised my dish did not come with rice (which I don't even believe was Jasmine) nor suggest that it be ordered. Nor did the waitress ask what type meat for the phad Thai.  And, besides, we waited for what seemed to be an eternity to order.\n\nThe saving grace was the fried banana with ice cream.  While it couldn't compare to Mt. Vernon's Thai House, it was still tasty.  Lots of ice cream, which I like.  And a big enough portion to feed 3.\n\nI can only assume that the cuisine has gone downhill since voted Best in the Bay in 2010.\n\nBottom line: unless you're only wanting dessert, try some other restaurant (assuming a good one exists).", "author": "C B."}

After a good 10-15 minutes of reviewing the menu, she sheepishly came over and gave us the lunch menu, apologizing for presenting it when we first arrived. The lunch menu made us change our initial choices, and we went with the following items:\n\n1) Papaya Salad: I've recently developed a huge appreciation for papaya salads when dining out for Thai cuisine. The papaya was fresh and crispy and was served alongside other vegetables. The sauce was a bit sweeter than what I was used to and lacked the typical heat that comes with a properly spiced salad. It was good, but definitely not the best I've had.\n2) Nuer Pad Plik was my boyfriend's choice, which was tender beef sauteed with fresh chili, basil and hot chili sauce. He commented that this dish was a bit sweet for his liking and that it didn't taste as hot as the description indicated. The meat was also chewy, leading for an overall \"meh\" feeling towards the entree.\n3) Pad Thai with prawns: This was just... okay. The sauce was also sweet (I'm sensing a pattern here) instead of the typical peanut base. The noodles were also more spaghetti like in size which I didn't really care for. The prawns were fresh, but they had a scant representation in the dish. The serving size was large, but I didn't want to eat much of this dish. \n\nThe service was incredibly slow and it took us about 15 minutes to get our waitress's attention once we had finished so that we could get our check and leave. I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to eat here as I'm sure there are other better Thai offerings in the area.", "author": "Megan K."}

Whether it is delivery or dine-in, I have always been pleased and we've become regulars.  \n\nMy standards for Thai food are incredibly high - I've vacationed in Thailand before and I spent 9 days eating as much authentic Thai cuisine as I could.\n\nWhen ordering for delivery they have always been quick, polite, and easy to work with.  Notable menu choices include their egg rolls, satay (looooooooove the peanut sauce, you can usually find me slurping up the remaining last drops out of the little cups they provide), beef with spinach, and the classic pad Thai is divine.  Their coconut milk soup is fantastic, and their pineapple fried rice brings me back to the beaches of Pattaya, chowing down on splendid deliciousness in a nameless hole in the wall. \n\nThe dine-in experience is not too bad.  While the restaurant is small and the tables are tight, the decor is nice and they try to pay attention to details.  The window seats are by far the most attractive, but overall the place is clean and tidy.  It's usually pretty empty in the early evenings and on weekdays...but since it's so convenient to get it delivered to us, we don't normally eat in.\n\nLemongrass is cheap and their portions are big.  If you're starving, polish the meal off, but usually we have wonderful, stomach-pleasing leftovers.  There's enough authenticity and flavor in their meals for you to easily forget yourself and stuff your face.  We've recommended the place to multiple friends and they all agree - Lemongrass is gooood.", "author": "Marie B."}

Just fyi, nothing was bad. \n\nThe 5 star items we ordered:\n- Pad Makuer Tofu: Probably the best thing we had here. Sauteed eggplant, tofu, onions, thai basil.  It had a very strong thai basil flavor that permeated the entire dish. Yum yum! The thai basil was so fully soaked in all the tofu and vegetables (and not just when you actually ate the basil like some other restaurants) that when I served myself some of this dish onto my pad thai, the surrounding few bites of pad thai tasted like basil. Amazing.\n\n- Veggie egg rolls: soo yummy! They were very crispy, and the vegetables inside were very fresh, especially the mung bean sprouts, which I love. There were 6 pieces (3 long egg rolls cut diagonally),\n\n- Papaya salad. I always love papaya salad, but this one was exceptionally good. It had a really fresh, vinegary/lemon taste and it was just the perfect level of spiciness. (We didn't blow steam and sweat buckets like we did across the street at the Vietnamese place Aux Delices-- thought that was also good)\n\n- Red curry with mixed veg: Solid curry. Good amount of curry, and I liked the proportion of curry to vegetables (last thai place I went to had 80% vegetables and 20% actual curry! boo!) The best thing we had here was the pad makuer tofu--- Sauteed eggplant and tofu with garlic chili sauce and basil.  Very strong thai basil flavor! Yum yum! It was fully soaked in all the tofu and vegetables, not just when you actually ate the basil. Ours had a slight bite, but it wasn't spicy-- I'm sure you could ask for it spicier.\n\n3 star items (good but average):\n- Poh-pier-sod: This was a rice paper roll stuffed with tofu, cucumber, carrots, etc. It was good, but I probably won't order it again. Easy appetizer to share-- came with 8 pieces. \n\n- Pad thai: This was good, but I've definitely had better. \nIt didn't have the strong fish sauce flavor that some Thai restaurants have. Some people prefer that strong flavor, some people hate that-- all depends. Just your average pad thai, really.

I used to think this place was great but maybe I had just ordered the right things or maybe they have just gone downhill.  Either way, with so many good places to eat in this city, I'm not going to waste my money here.  The last time I came in for lunch the service was awful and rude and the meal was mediocre at best.  I asked if I could order a cup of the Tom Kha because it wasn't on the menu.  The waitress said \"yes, but you're going to order more than that, right??\" I told her that I was planning on it and then wondered whether I looked particularly thin or shabby that day. Trying to put that out of my mind, I continued browsing the menu trying to find something different.  I usually order a curry so i decided to go with something I hadn't tried before (and maybe this was my mistake) and ordered some fried tofu dish with crispy basil.  The sauce was bland, the tofu was chewy and again...bland, and the basil was just weird.  The problem with tofu is that generally it is pretty flavorless but it soaks up whatever sauce you cook it in.  So if the sauce is bland, the tofu is bland.  I would expect a Thai restaurant to understand this.  On top of it all the waitress continued to be short with me.  I used to order take out form here very frequently and came in for dinner every so often.  I doubt I will be back (especially with Aux Delices right across the street).

We wanted something fresh new and somewhat healthy. We have tried most places in Russian Hill and Nob Hill, but little did we know how Lemongrass would spark a new love for Thai food.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised by the soft, warm, inviting ambiance and the friendly staff. We were lucky enough to utilize one of their reserved parking spots in front. Once we got settled inside we were greeted by the most friendly petite Thai woman. She was an enjoyable waitress and recommended the best dishes to try. \n\nWe started out with a spicy soup with shrimp and moved on to a tofu dish and the other a chicken dish on the specials. Each item had a unique delicious flavor. \n\nI am very exited to find a new favorite place just right around the corner. With reasonable prices for an amazing dinner. \n\nI recommend to enjoying a cup of Jasmine tea as well...\n\nCheers!", "author": "Dee C."}

Little Thai (often regaled as a fave) failed miserably, especially in the coconut soup (Tom Kha Ghai). Thai Spice, further up the street on Polk, also suffered an embarrassing loss. Every place I tried couldn't meet up to the flavor, price or selection of Lemongrass. They master the \"basics\" like Pad Thai and take their curries to an enviable level of awesomeness.

I also tried the praram neur (beef and spinach with peanut sauce) which was also good.\n\nBut - the reason I have to write is that the waitstaff here is SOO so so SOO accommodating. This crazy lady with a somewhat British accent came in with some other person. She asked for them to close the door because she was sooo cold - well, they were delivering their food, so it was sorta hard to keep the door closed. Then I heard her say that she called ahead of time for Lemongrass to raise their thermostat to a higher temperature! OK - i have NEVER ever heard of this, but thought hmm, that's cool that they were willing to do it....\n\nthen she pointed to a light across the room asking the waitress to turn it off because the fluorescent lights \"annoyed\" her. The waittress already turned the light so it faced the wall but said that she needed to leave it on SO SHE COULD SEE!! I then look up and see that there are barely any lights on and the ceiling lights are on, but dim. My brother and I are cracking up at this point. Since I'm sitting next to this crazy whacked out weirdo, I can't stare...but I see my brother and his expression.

We walked in and found ourselves in the middle of the dining room. I'm glad we didn't wind up sitting by the door.\n\nWe were seated quickly and offered menus. Between what was on the menu and an accompanying sheet of specials, there was far too much to choose from.  The waitress came to take our order. I asked about several items including Chicken Tom Yum Noodles. She assured me I would prefer the Nuer Yang over the noodles. Hmmm. How could she know what I would like (or not like)? I ordered the Nuer Yang and the chicken Larb. \n\nThe Larb soon arrived. The order was large. My daughter being a vegetarian did not partake. (She ordered the Basil Crispy tofu, sauted with limejuice, chili,green and red bell peppers and basil; served with rice.) The Larb was tasty and I finished the order. For my entree I had the Nuer Yang (broiled top sirloin beef, sliced and served with lime juice). The beef was a bit overcooked and felt as if it had been prepared earlier and kept to serve. My daughter enjoyed her Tofu but there was far too much for her to finish.\n\nThe food? Good to fair with portions being at least generous to gigantic. Make the portions a bit smaller with a bit more attention to quality. It could be that if I had ordered from the specials menu it would have been fresher/better.

I put myself through college working at a thai restaurant--even worked up my tolerance for spice to compete with the dudes in the kitchen by the time I was graduating--so I take my thai food very seriously.\n\nThe food here is authentic and reasonably priced and they DELIVER.  What more could you ask for?  The menu is vast--ranging from their safer dishes for those unaccostomed to thai food and its wonderful flavors (I still love a good pad thai, too) to those that only the true lover of thai food would order.  \n\nThey make a killer green papaya salad and their curries are smooth and spicey--no matter which one you get (you know how green curry can get clumpy sometimes, well they do it well).  And mango sticky rice!! It's SO good it'll change your perception of rice forever.\n\nI have to admit that I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, because I'm a sucker for free delivery.

It was all delicious. Contrary to some other reviews regarding greasiness I was relieved to find Thai that was so flavorful and not at all greasy, nor drowned in sauce. All the ingredients seemed very fresh and the sauces were well balanced, testing your pallete to discern the distinct flavors without being overwhelming. \nThe waitstaff were friendly and courteous, the decor simple and inviting, but the food was the real standout. Loved it, definitely recommend. However, since this is my first sampling of Thai food in the city I am giving it 4 stars while I search for the elusive 5 star Thai place.", "author": "Megan G."}

The Rad Nar was also watery and boring. Pad Kee Mao was just plain bad. For some reason all the dishes were served on wax paper inside the to go boxes.

Very good. Other items that were good was the Larb Kai salad and the Pad Thai, very standard food but nonetheless very good.\n\nThe service was good, as the waitress was attentive and helpful in taking our orders and making sure our beer and water supply never ran out. She was not as helpful in assisting with the myriad of choices and what she liked best. She seemed to recommend the entire , which of course was the problem in the first place, just too many good choices.

However, when crowded it is small and thus got noisy.\n\nThe only real knock on this place is the price of the food, while note outrageous for a SF meal, it was pricey for comparable Thai meals.

Yes, inside you will find charming authentic Thai decorations, but beware- the place is cramped and it is rather easy to knock over and break artwork and dishes (as I managed to do even before sitting at our table). The wait staff is extremely friendly (yet slow moving) and greeted us with a \"sawadee-ka\"upon entering. After squeezing into our table we perused the menu and decided on pad kee mow with chicken, vegetable tom yum, panang curry with beef and squash and steamed mussels for Kenny. The soup came first, lukewarm, and slightly fishy tasting with tofu and vegetables. Definitely not the best tom yum by a long stretch. Steamed mussels followed suite, floating in an aromatic basily broth, which was actually better than the tom yum. The pad kee mow was passable, but nothing special and definitely not as spicy as I would have preferred. Usually I expect pad kee mow to have lettuce and tomatoes and chili, but this one came topped with bean sprouts, peppers, and onions. The noodles were not terribly tasty- not nearly as good as the noodles at Little Thai, which is just down the street (then again that was pad see ew, but similar dishes nonetheless). The panang beef with squash was okay, but again, I've had better curries than this.
