We decided to come here around 3:00pm for their Happy Hour that I'd heard so much about. Um, yeah. It was a Saturday. Duh. We decided to stay anyway, since the restaurant wasn't busy. We got a table with a gorgeous view! The view is priceless, I will give you that.  Our server let us take our time, as we each had a glass of wine and some sour dough bread.\nAt 4:00pm we decided to order dinner. I got the seared scallops and my husband got the Hawaiian Opah, cooked in banana leaves. We started out, splitting a salad with blue cheese crumbles and candied walnuts.\nThe salad was plenty for two, simple and good.\nMy scallops were seared to perfection. The Opah wasn't quite as spectacular as when we were in Hawaiian-- but we assumed it was frozen and not fresh...obviously.\nOur server brought us a complimentary dessert with a candle-- nice touch.\nI think we sat here for close to two hours. Total bill, with tip was about $160.00.  We expected that, given this is San Francisco. We had such a relaxing and romantic time, loved the view, the wine, the food...that we felt this was worth it.\nWe come to SFO every few years. I'd come back, for sure.  Like I said, the view is breathtaking. Simply beautiful!", "author": "Debby F."}

The restaurant called me to make sure my reservation time and number of people on the day of. I arrived 10 minutes earlier than the reservation time, but they were able to seat us. As requested, they placed us near the window. \nFood was pricey, but on a special occasion, it was okay. One thing they can improve is bringing out the food quicker. The waitress came with new utensils, but it took 10-15 minutes for our main dish to come out. The gap between our appetizer and the main dish was very long as well. \nHowever, the food was great. I ordered chicken and it was moist. The sauce was not over powering the chicken or the potatoes. My boyfriend ordered scallops and they were pretty good. It's a little disappointing for someone who eats a lot. The birthday girl ordered steak. The cut was pretty big and the meat was cooked medium rare (just how she asked for). The birthday boy ordered a seafood plate with mussels, crab, squid, and lobster. That plate was big and the sauce went well with the bread.\nAt the end, the waitress came with two muffins with ice cream on top for the birthday people. I was very pleased with the service! Not to mention, they handed us menus that said \"happy birthday\" on the top! \nI would come back here for special occasions, or for a date. We did dress up for this occasion, but I did see people who wore casual. There were kids and couples. I would say this is a good place to go for tourist.

I quickly walked down the steps and went to the restaurant. The hostess asked if I had reservations and I said no. They told me it was not an issue and quickly sat me at a table with a GREAT View! My waitress was very personable and knowledgeable.\n\nFood: Alright. I wish I could say I would want  to eat dinner here again(I'd come back for maybe dessert or a drink - definitely for the start and environment). The drink was pretty good. They managed to take the pine taste out of the gin drink?! Haha, I didn't know what I was going to get, but it was good. The sourdough was pretty epic! The dinner though, it was mediocre. I managed to crouch down on a bone in my fish. :( and the sauce was super buttery tasting. The fish also didn't have any salt or   Seasoning. \n\nDinner was $44 dollars. $26 fish, $13 was the drink and there was a surcharge which I wasn't sure what that was.

For the main course (we sampled each other's plates), I had the  crab & shrimp stuffed Salmon, arugula, sun-dried tomatoes, brie cheese, mashed potatoes, and vegetables. Mr. E had the sesame crusted Ahi tuna, wasabi mashed potatoes, baby bok choy, Mongolian black pepper sauce (not pictured) - a new culinary adventure for him that he did enjoy, but probably won't try again. We relied on our server, Jose, for our dinner wine - kudos to him! He suggested a delightful Napa Valley Chardonnay that paired very well with our meal.\n\nFor dessert, Mr. E ordered the seasonal cheesecake - which was strawberry creme angalaise. It was beautifully presented - and just downright perfect to the taste and texture. So as not to disturb the euphoria still resonating in my taste buds, I had the light and delicate seasonal sorbet - raspberry flavor.

Unfortunately, that's what McCormick & Kuletos did when our party of 6 had lunch there. When you think about it, that shouldn't have been the case:\n- Location is fantastic, and they seated us by the windows so we had maximum view of the bay. Interior was also nice and they used the space well (i.e., while there were many tables, you didn't feel like you were squished in with other diners).\n- Service was good: quick and prompt, friendly without being intrusive, good suggestions.\n\nSo everything was set up for a fantastic meal... except the food fell way short of the expectations. We had:\n- Lobster and dungeness crab dip: This appetizer was my favourite. Strong flavours (i.e., not watered down at all which sometimes happens with appetizers), good for table sharing.\n- Pan seared scallops: Ok-to-good dish. Scallops were well done (which can be tricky), and the corn and bacon bits complimented them well. That said, it was a bit too salty for my tastes.\n- Crab and shrimp stuffed salmon: Huge disappointment. I couldn't taste the crab or the shrimp at all, and the overriding salmon taste was bland (and not in a taste-the-freshness-of-the-salmon type way)\n- Dungeness crab and shrimp roll: Another huge disappointment. The crab tasted like one of those filler/fake ones, and I couldn't taste the shrimp at all. The bread was also a bit tough to chew. The side fries were pretty good though.\n\nFor a seafood place, there were a lot of misses on the seafood dishes.

They had printed menus with a special message - my husbands name and Happy 65th Birthday - a little corny indeed but it was a nice touch. We started with the crab and lobster dip - OMG, it was delicious - decadent and fattening and so necessary. I had the caesar (good but maybe a bit bland) and the ahi tuna, very good, large portion. My daughter had the stuffed salmon which she inhaled. She also had a Lavendar mojito which was quite tasty! The birthday boy opted for cucumber and heirloom tomato salad and grilled swordfish. His meal was also very good. We then shared the pre-ordered dessert - blueberry crumble - very good! I wasn't blown away (though the dip was pretty out of this world) but it was a very solid meal.

Our Aunt stumbled into this restaurant during a work conference and loved it so she was excited to take us. McCormick's in SF has a fantastic view of the bay. They strategically staged all of their tables in tiers so every table can enjoy the view no matter where you sit. \nGood tips:\n-They have a good brunch menu for a cheaper price\n- If you like Bloody Mary's they have an awesome menu\n- The wine menu is extensive\nI ordered the Black Angus Ribeye Steak with seasonal veggies and my lady had the seared scallops topped with a mixture of corn and bacon. The steak was cooked perfectly and it was seasoned well. My girlfriend liked the scallops but thought the dish was too salty. The kiddo had pancakes and our Aunt had the grilled Mahi Mahi. Our Uncle settled for breakfast as well with an omelet. All of the food was great. The wine list is extensive so I went with a glass of sauvignon following the Aunt's great taste in wine. The whole experience was great having wine with lunch and enjoying the view of the bay on a sunny day. Our server was polite but was absent a little more than we'd like.

The view was spectacular. My family and I went after seeing the Blue Angels for Fleet Week and although we did not have a reservation they were able to seat us.\n\nIt's fairly pricey, but that is expected from about every McCormick restaurant. But similarly the food was wonderful, I had the 7 oz. filet mignon rare with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. My family had the seared ahi tuna meal and the grilled scallops, both of which they said were very good. (It is possible all the walking from Fleet Week exaggerated the taste of the food.) My parents also enjoyed a sparking wine sampler with I believe it was La Marca Proseco, Gloria Ferrer, and Mumm (Brut?). Nothing particularly spectacular, but they had a fun time trying the different wines. As did many others, it appeared to be a popular order; that and the Kendall Jackson. \n\nIt is worth noting that this place has a 6% additional fee to help them compete in San Fransisco. Which seems ridiculous to me, there were plenty of people and the bill was quite expensive. But keep that in mind if you plan on going here.", "author": "Katrina U."}

However, the location lures casuals like myself. Where I sat, had a nice view of Alcatraz over the tall railing...\n\nService: You're given a look of hesitation for dressing casually into this place that appears to be fancy. Our servers (not sure if we were supposed to have multiple) couldn't remember our 2 item order but polite yet inattentive. Other servers didn't know where to bring dishes. Food also took 35minutes to come out...\n\nFood: Mediocre and sorry for its price. I'm very glad I did not go all out on this place.\n1) the BOWL of clam chowder was the best of the 2 things I had. It didn't taste too creamy, and you can actually taste the clam umami. The serving, however, was a coffee mug worth of chowder... I can't imagine how small the cup size is...\n2) the filet mignon: do not let the appearance fool you. It was a huge disappointment, but it had visually impressive sears. The order was for a $37 medium-rare filet mignon (additional charge for mashed potatoes... Seriously? I skipped 'cause I didn't have a huge appetite). What I got was was a well-done/medium-well palm size piece of meat with burnt squash and two pieces of tomatoes... The meat was not savoury, tasted like it dried out and got soaked in butter to gain the moisture back, and contained next to no presence of pink meat. The pile of squash and 2 tomatoes... I won't bother.\n\nOverall, they tried. It's not the worst place, but it is not worth what you pay. I advise adapting to the tourist theme, make sure the servers don't seem lost, and improve the pricing for food quality/proportion: 1) Get someone who can cook meat properly, 2) Choose better veggies/fruits that people like to add colour to the steak (majority dislike squash..), 3) A bowl instead of a cup-size bowl.", "author": "Albert T."}

It's below average.\n\nOnce upon a time, there was a restaurant in San Francisco called Kuleto's. As I recall, there were two locations (although there may have been more). One was on Powell Street near O'Farrell. The other (this one) was/is in Ghirardelli Square. Apparently, the one on Powell has closed its doors, and so this restaurant with the spectacular views of the bay and a remarkably wonderful floor plan is what's left.\n\nThis used to be a shockingly good restaurant, despite its location in a tourist containment area. It always had fresh fish and seafood of other kinds, and it consistently had a wide variety of fresh oysters available. It was not inexpensive but not exorbitant. The bread was fantastic (just as it should be so close to Boudin and the Wharf).\n\nIt has become a below average restaurant. Indeed it is now exactly what one might have expected it to always have been: a restaurant in a touristy location with a fabulous view and disappointing food and adequate service.\n\nEverything about the dining is forgettable. The upside is that this means things aren't horrible...horrible is memorable. This is not horrible. It's merely adequate. The bread isn't what it used to be, the seafood seems Costco-level, and the other food items are neither bad nor good. The property clearly has the feel of being part of a much larger family of brands, and it is.\n\nIf you have tame expectations, this restaurant will not disappoint you. And the view remains tremendous. Certainly a good place for cocktails. Tighten your belt and head elsewhere, or sit down and enjoy this Marie Callender's-by-the-Sea. \n\nYou'll remember nothing but the view. And that ain't half bad.", "author": "Joe A."}

Food tasted amazing but our waiter (Thomas) made us feel unwelcomed there. He was rude, short with us and ignored us multiple times. It took almost 10 minutes from the time we sat down before he even introduced himself to us.

Try to sit near a window, you'll have the best views. \n\nOur food was delicious. A bit on the pricey side (but hey, it's steak and seafood, whaddya expect?), but worth every penny. Our server was a bit blah, which is the reason for 4/5 instead of 5/5. Tried to make conversation and crack jokes, but he seemed more interested in just getting orders in quickly. Even told him this place was highly recommended by our tour guide, but he kind of just stared at me. Twas a bit strange.\n\nHowever, I noticed multiple managers on the floor aiding the servers in filling up drinks and clearing off tables. That is much admired - coming from someone who works in the restaurant industry, that kind of stuff tells a lot. \n\nTIP: MAKE A RESERVATION ONLINE. Seriously, it's so easy. We were seated promptly (actually, 15 mins early!).", "author": "Renn J."}

There were several issues with my Saturday evening experience:\n(1) Cocktails in the bar were ordered, but when we received them (15min) they were the wrong drinks - it took 20min to correct to the right drink and we received a bit of an attitude from the bar staff.\n(2) We were seated at our table in the back area of the restaurant, adjacent to two very loud parties.  Despite our request, the service staff did not ask the other guests to 'take it down a notch'.\n(3) The food was not really that great.  I had the Ahi Tuna dish - and it was o.k. My 'house salad' was mixed greens, Gorgonzola and walnuts - very underwhelming. \n(4) We asked to speak with the manager 'Steve' as we wrapped up our meal.  Steve was defensive, even mildly argumentative, when we shared our complaints.  He offered no condolences or reprieve. \n\nOverall, I would not recommend this establishment to others and I will not be returning.", "author": "Serena S."}

My wife ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Scampi Pasta.  We also ordered the Crab & Lobster Dip appetizer.  \n\nThe appetizer was amazing!  A huge portion that could easily satisfy 4 people.  It was cheesy and chalk full of crab and lobster.\n\nThe crab claws were delicious!  The were all cut which made enjoying them quite easy.  My wife loved the scampi pasta which was full of shrimp and had a fantastic light and creamy sauce,  Both of these portions were also quite large.\n\nWe decided to throw caution to the wind and order desert even though we were already full.  We ordered a cinnamon blueberry cake dish.  (I don't recall the name.)  The cake portion was light and sweet.  It was cooked over an amazing blueberry compote.

We wanted to sit by the window and watch the show with a cocktail. We come in and tried to get a table and the hostess Sylvia was more than rude and unaccommodating. She asked if we had reservations and we said unfortunately no and was just a walk in. There were a few tables open in sight. And she just said \"no we only take reservations\" and walked out. So my friends and I just looked at each other and walked out. I got on my phone and checked on how to make reservations and there were plenty of time available but I asked my friends if they still wanna support this establishment after such a rude treatment by this SYLVIA. They said yes lol, so I made a reservations and went back in. And we smiled and said hi we now have a reservations can we have a table now? And she said \"I don't like you\" and I said I'm supporting this business how can you not like customers but she just grabbed the menus and pointed us to our table. Our server Benjamin was accommodating and apologetic when we told him about the incident. Then we got our cocktails, one of the glasses were chipped so he was trying to replace it with another one and per our server the bartender decided the right thing to do was dump my martini into a wine glass. Also my friends mint julep we're just crumpled mint and ice and a very weak cocktail. It was very disappointing to say the least.

It will keep that area discreet and free from butt to back touching. The booth seats below the stadium seating needs an opaque divider. As we sat eating you could see peoples feet and crotches.

I am still reeling from how poorly everything went - as a former waitress, I cannot reconcile myself to how poorly everything was handled. It wasn't just one thing, it was a series of ridiculous and entirely avoidable situations.\n\nBecause the restaurant won't seat you at your reservation time unless all party members have arrived, I waited at the bar, where I was joined by my party. Our bartender was very good and for 4 drinks (1 cocktail and 3 glasses of wine), our bar tab was $58.00. That went quick!\n\nWe then went to our table. We waited 25 minutes to be approached by our waiter; I ordered a bottle of the same wine from him. He returned in good time and poured it round so now we were ready to order. I ordered the Hawaiian Opah fish dish, which I had never had before but was excited to try. Two of my guests ordered the cioppino (a San Francisco seafood stew) and the remaining 2 ordered scallops, and 2 of us ordered small salads as starters. The waiter returned within a few minutes to explain that the kitchen was out of the Hawaiian Opah and asked me to choose a new dish. I saw at the top of the menu that they had a \"simply grilled\" section, so i told him I wanted the Ahi Tuna, simply grilled. He pointed to the Ahi dish on the menu and asked, \"This one?\" I explained no, I didn't want that dish because the tuna here is sesame crusted and I don't want bok choy. Instead, I just want the fish itself simply grilled. He said it would be no problem and left - although I was confused why he didn't ask if I wanted any other items on the plate with the fish, I assumed the kitchen would accompany it with some vegetables.\n\nThe beginning salads were delivered and I had ordered the \"Heirloom Tomato and Cucumber\" version. The dish was 98% cucumber in a parsley dill sauce (quite good) with only 2 slices of tomato. I would have assumed a 50/50 combo here, or at least 40/60 as they were showcasing the heirloom tomatoes. It was a bit disappointing because of the missing tomatoes.\n\nWhen our entrees were delivered, only 3 dishes came out first: 2 cioppinos and one scallop. After a few minutes, my dish was delivered to me, except it was seafood stuffed salmon. Due to a bivalve allergy, I cannot risk eating something which may have clams, scallops, oysters or mussels, so it wasn't even an option for me to accept this dish. I explained I didn't order salmon, and the table runner asked what I had ordered. I said that I requested the Ahi Tuna simply grilled. He immediately went back to the kitchen. \n\nI was left to wonder, \"Where is my other diner's scallops dish?\" But it didn't come! \n\n15 minutes later, the table runner comes back with the missing scallops (thank God) and a new dish for me. You guessed it: it was the Ahi Tuna sesame crusted with bok choy dish - the specific one I said I did not want. \n\nBy this point, my client who ordered the scallops had already finished her meal, and the two cioppino diners were about halfway through. I was also highly embarrassed by this point. The table runner insisted he would get me whatever I wanted, but as my clients were nearly finished and I had no confidence it would be satisfactory again, I declined. \n\nDuring the remaining 35 minutes of our meal, our waiter never returned to our table. This was an opportunity to explain what had happened, apologise, and maybe even try to upsell us on a 2nd bottle of wine. At the very least, he could've bussed the table. \n\nI excused myself to the ladies' room where I then experience \"the final straw.\" Out of 5 ladies' stalls, one of them had toilet roll. The others had stacks of paper towels in each one, as desperate women were using this item instead of loo roll. There were also paper towels scattered all over the floor.\n\nI went back to our table, where the waiter finally came to bus the dirty dishes. I asked to see the manager, who said that he understood there was a kitchen order mixup with my dish. I explained to him in great detail all of the above. \n\nHe explained that Mark was \"one of his better servers\" and he was very sorry this had happened. He also said he had no female hostesses on staff, and these ladies are the ones who normally check the women's toilets throughout the night. He admitted he should've sent a dishwasher in periodically to see how the room looked. \n\nHe expressed confusion as to why the 2nd scallop dish was so delayed in being delivered, apologised, and said he would take this dish off the menu. I explained patiently that it wasn't just the server's fault; there were clearly numerous problems going on in this restaurant. He asked what more he could do to satisfy me and so I suggested he also take the single bottle of wine off the check.", "author": "Christie F."}

It was our last night in town, and we had to be up early Monday (President's Day) to drive back home to Los Angeles for work on the following Tuesday. \n\nWe decided that our last meal would be at McCormick and Kuletos, a restaurant recommended highly by one of the three friends I went with. Two of my friends got separate meals -- I believe on was shrimp scampi and the other was the linguini. \n\nBut me and one other friend got the San Francisco Cioppino. \n\nAround 2 AM, I was woken up by a gurgling in my stomach and had to rush to the bathroom to vomit. My other friend, the one who also got the Cioppino came into the bathroom and started to vomit as well. For the rest of the night until early morning, we could do nothing but vomit. I attempted to sip water, but could not keep anything down. The minute I started to drink, I would vomit. \n\nBecause we HAD to be back for work, we piled in the car with thick trash bags and proceeded to make the long drive home. I vomited whenever I attempted to hold down liquid, and quickly began to dry heave. We were about 3 hours out when I began to vomit bile. Now, that's a really bad sign. Because the next thing after bile is blood. I began to feel light headed as well, as if I were going to pass out. And my whole body was shaking. \n\nThe nearest place was a hospital. They immediately got me in and gave me two IV bags of water and told me that it was good I stopped by and that i likely would have passed out had I attempted to continue the drive. They gave me some anti-nausea medicine and advised me to slowly start to drink liquids while on the anti-nausea medication. We drove the rest of the way home after that, and I had to spend the next two days home from work as I continued to slowly recover due to health complications from the food poisoning. \n\nWe informed McCormick and Kuletos of what happened, and they were very insensitive, didn't apologize, and were only concerned with asserting that we were 'fine now' so everything should be OK. We requested a refund of the meal and that they should assist with my medical bills. \n\nThis became a two month process of attempting to get in contact with them over and over. They were always very slow to respond. Finally, this past week, I received a notice in the mail that they will not honor my claim and that they deny all accountability related to our food poisoning. They did not even refund the meal. What was supposed to be a nice $30 meal to cap a great vacation has become a very expensive hospital bill that I will be paying off over the course of the next year. \n\nTheir food poisoning ruined the entire ending of the vacation for all four of us. \n\nThey do not care about their customers or their experience. \n\nDO NOT EAT HERE.", "author": "Ethan L."}

Manager emailed to smooth over but she never followed through with promised phone contact.    \n**********************\n\nTOURIST TRAP- Burn and Churn service and food.   LOCALS should avoid.     \n\nMy Wife and I had lunch here in June.  It was a spur of the moment thing and nothing special.   I had a crab melt (waiter was able to get cook to accommodate) and my Wife had a scallop plate, that went back twice-   Grit in scallops, cooked to death the second plate.  \n\nWe thought we'd try again (hey---it used to be good like 15 years ago....) so..... We made reservations for 7 people for 530pm on 23DEC17.   We received a confirmation call three hours prior.   We told them we would be on time.\n\nWe arrived on time.  Hostess said they were short handed and seating would be delayed.   We asked for a table near the bar, as the lobby was packed and we were tired of getting bumped by passer bys.  We were told we could go to the bar, but no tables could be attended.  \n\nI reminded the MGR when he came up that we had a reservation for our 30th wedding  Anniversary.   We were in suits and ladies in gowns and heels, as we had attended the afternoon Nutcracker Show.   We were not walk in tourists looking for a last minute table.\n\nWe  were seated at a nice corner, window table.   The menus were customized wishing us a Happy 30th Anniversary. We ordered drinks and appetizers after a more than lengthy wait.  Our server was a nice lady, but slow.  \n\nWe had dinner show up before salads, and were asked if we still wanted them.  We elected to pass, citing we'd prefer to have had t hem prior, and we did request a second round of drinks. (never came, never billed)\n\nMy Wife ordered a scallop and shrimp medley, and was satisfied, but did say it was not hot.   My Brother had medallions, his Wife a chicken plate and my Daughter a ravioli.     I had ordered a Filet mid-rare, and it was near raw.  Blood dark red and cold in and out.  \n\nI requested it be replaced.      20 minutes later, it arrived.  Same piece brought out (end cut of the tenderloin, flat and triangular, the piece is usually butterflied and sold as medallions, not served as a filet..... just saying....) missing the end I had cut into.   I cut it directly in half.  Still cold, still blood rare.   The manager (assumed he was) had brought it. I called him back over to show him.  He graciously offered to \"replace with anything on the menu\". \n\nI declined.   The whole party had finished their meals 10 minutes prior to the \"re-fire\" showing up.    Secondly, if a steak house cannot cook a simple filet to medium rare, what possesses them to think they can do anything right? \n\nHe brought a bottle of Scharffenberger sparkling wine from Mendecino ($13 at Safeway, but nice touch) to apologize.    He sent out a round of deserts on him.   \n\nIn all fairness, I just wanted a steak for dinner at a professed steak house.      I had iced tea and water, and a piece of shortbread from a desert.   My Wife and I are LDS and don't drink, and I'm gluten intolerant.   Desert was a no go. \n\nDisappointed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-14", "description": "I am a real fan of the food and ambiance that McCormick & Kuleto's Seafood & Steaks provides for tourists and locals alike. I once had the opportunity to come for an event and eat in their Captain's Room. With their nicely prepared food and stunning view of the bay from the restaurant's huge bay windows, I knew I had to return one day! Luckily I finally got the chance to try out a few dishes and all I can say is I can't wait to come back for more and try out their Happy Hour.\n\nFriends and I came on a gloomy Sunday afternoon after having a fun old time at the nearby Ghirardelli Chocolate Festival. And after that event concluded late Sunday afternoon, we were still experiencing our sugar high and needed to get some food in our system. It also helped that at the fest McCormick & Kuleto's provided the best treat of all the vendors, a chocolate ganache tart, plus they gave away coupons for a dessert worth ten dollars, so we were sold. Fortunately for us, McCormick & Kuleto's wasn't packed on this day and even allowed us to get a reservation (and therefore points via OpenTable!). Our wait for a table was a mere five minutes and the staff was nice to place the three of us at a beautiful table in the center of their dining room overlooking Aquatic Park and San Francisco Bay.\n\nWe knew weren't super hungry and although we were bummed that McCormick & Kuleto's don't have a Happy Hour on weekends as well, we decided since we were so close to Fisherman's Wharf, we all wanted clam chowder. The best and most affordable option was to get one New England Clam Chowder sourdough bowl to share and since they were not as hungry have another of our diners get the chowder in a regular bowl and eat that with the complimentary bread they serve. At $13.50 and $8 respectively, both prices were actually quite worth it. The clam chowder tasted warm and flavorful filled with a decent amount of clams versus potatoes and the best part was the warm soup melted the sides of the sourdough bread bowl really nicely so when you scraped the sides there was an equal bread to soup ratio on your spoon. For our second dish, we chose from the appetizer menu, the Steamed P.E.I. Black Mussels topped with Fennel, Linguica Sausage and most importantly Jalapeno Cilantro Butter. It was that butter sauce which was rich and creamy and totally made the dish one of my favorite mussel dishes of all time and it was perfectly paired with the complimentary bread. The linguica sausage tasted more like traditional Chinese lap cheong sausage, but I give them credit for having the dish filled with plenty of mussels, as there was not a single empty shell in the entire dish.\n\nDespite only having two dishes we were stuffed as there was plenty of food on both plates. We still had our dessert coupon to use and after perusing the menu, we were all chocolated out so we went with the Upside Down Candied Walnut Apple Pie which was baked twice with a Candied Walnut Crust with warm caramel sauce and served with Double Rainbow vanilla bean ice cream. It tasted like an apple crostini meets and upside down cake, warm and fluffy and paired perfectly when served with the huge scoop of ice cream. It was the perfect way to end the evening with a warm meal. The good news continued because my friend was able to use her Landry's points thanks to McCormick, which is affiliated with the nationwide McCormick & Schmick's franchise but named after their local restaurateur-owner Paul Kuleto, also being apart of that group's rewards program so our bill was very very affordable. Everything was perfect, from our food to the service provided by our server Shakela, who treated us like friends, made this late afternoon meal one to remember. I just reminded me that franchises that exist in tourist meccas like Ghirardelli Square can be a great place for locals to enjoy a nice meal as well!", "author": "Jason F."}

She wanted steak and lobster and this is the better option I could find within a short time frame. We got a decent table on the second tier facing the water. Once our food came around though it had gotten really dark to see our food. So, about the food: I ordered the mushroom and cheese ravioli in tomato basil cream sauce, my mom ordered a large crab plate, my younger siblings just ordered off the kid's menu, and I honestly did not see what the rest of the adults ate. I asked for lobster bisque as a starter for my mom and I to share, because one, a bisque always sounds tasty, and I saw it mentioned in many reviews. The waitress brought it out with 4 spoons but no other small bowls. I do not mind eating from the same bowl as my mom but others wanted to try as well, and I was not about to have them dipping their spoons in over and over. The waitress looked at me a little funny when I asked, but that's okay. I found the taste to be amazing, but to my surprise my mom quickly stopped eating. \"I can taste too much butter\", she said. She also thought maybe too much heavy cream. I had a few more spoonfuls before deciding she was probably right. My mom's crab with mashed potatoes (they don't have baked potatoes) came out and she was ecstatic. My circular ravioli, covered in the cream sauce, looked okay as well. I never have been and never will be into sauces being slathered sll over my meals. But I gave it a shot. All I could really taste was the semi-firm eggplant in the pasta. The sauce, much like the bisque, was so heavy in cream. I looked at the plate and remembered it was $21. I was not hungry enough nor interested enough in the plate to justify that. I sent it back and asked for a simple side of mac n' cheese, which was made with gruyere and truffle oil, supposedly. I liked it better and couldn't even finish half the bowl. I was much happier with my $8 pasta. \n\nThe food was good and the service was professional. She wasn't a spunky waitress by any means but she was helpful. She also made sure to bring out a little dessert for my mom's birthday. Overall, I did like the food, and there is a small chance I'd come back to try the Dungeness crab cake.

It's a place to take your date out for enjoying the romantic scenery across from the bay. It's a place to feel like a high roller with some wine in a wine glass. It's also a place to feel like a fancy diner for about 60-90 minutes then cry at the dinner bill for even eating like the Queen of England, but hey... It was all worth it in the end.\n\nMy mother, sister, and I stumbled upon this restaurant to fill our empty stomachs. From the time we entered to dine-in to the time we left, we embraced the elegance of the restaurant. \n\nOur course started off with beverages and a plate of bread with butter. Although the bread was too chewy to handle, it was enough to keep me sane throughout the next dish. Next came out the soup. While my mother and sister ate the clam chowder, I enjoyed slurping my chicken and rice soup. The chicken and rice soup was flavorful and not too salty nor bland. I love the balanced ratio between chicken, rice and vegetables. On the other hand, I sampled a little bit of the clam chowder and it was rich and creamy with a distinct garlic aftertaste. Afterwards we got our main dish! My mom had the Mahi-Mahi, my sister had eggplant ravioli, and I had the clam linguini. All dishes were equally good as I took a sample out of my mom's and sister's plate, but my pasta was the hi light of my afternoon. I love how the dish was represented and the noodles were cooked. The white wine the chef used for the pasta plus the pepper crumbs neutralized the clams making it taste savory with a slight spicy kick.

Sat and had a drink at the bar while we waited for our table to be ready (we were early for our reservation.) No one came to tell us when our table was ready (even though they said they would), we had to go ask.\n\nWe were sat right in front of the huge Windows, which was nice. It was relatively busy, but it was a Saturday night so that's to be expected. Drinks came quickly which was nice. We ordered appetisers (soup and salad). Sourdough bread was brought out quickly after our order and soup and salad came out reasonably. They were both tasty.\n\nOur main courses took quite a while to me. Luckily I still like my husband enough to talk to him and make the time pass. When they did come, we were actually really happy with them. Husband's filet mignon was cooked perfectly and really flavourful, which was nice because most places overcook steaks. My seared ahi was also really nice when paired with all the sides, but on its own was a bit bland. We both finished our meals, so we were too full for dessert.\n\nOverall, good meal, good service. Things could be better, especially for the price, but I wasn't disappointed. The only thing that was upsetting really was the bathrooms were a mess. Trash overflowing and toilet paper all over the floor. Nobody had obviously checked on them for a long time.", "author": "Sarah K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-02-06", "description": "I am very sad to write this review because going in I thought it would be another 5 star experience confirming the expectations I had of a restaurant/group of this reputation and caliber.  Honestly, they could have easily done WAY better and earned the full 5 stars.\n\nUnfortunately not.\n\nPros:\n1. There were 2 of us and we were sightseeing around the square, and too lazy to go elsewhere for dinner after a tiring day, so around 5:30pm on Friday evening, we decided to check if M&K had reservations for later in the evening. I walked in and spoke to the hostess, who was very sweet and engaging, and she immediately hooked us up for a Bay view table for 6pm.\n2. When we returned at 6pm, we were immediately seated in the front, on the balcony level.  While I preferred being right by the window, those tables were clearly being saved for larger groups, and the booth we had was central and not shabby at all.  Turned out later that we actually realized we had a better view since we were higher up and looking over the others by the window than past them.\n3. The Crab & Shrimp Stuffed Salmon - more on this below.\n\nCons:\n1. Our Waiter.  He was awful.  Nothing at all what I had expected.  I went to wash my hands and left the kiddo, who happens to be an adult, alone at the table. She was ignored the entire time I was gone. When I returned, no one showed up for about 10 minutes even though the restaurant was still not busy. Once our waiter did show, and realized we only wanted to drink waters with our meals, he became aloof and non-existent. He brought our waters and bread and took our orders all at once, barely replied to my question of what he recommended, and then vanished until we had to flag him down for the check.  My daughter, who always sees the best in people and never points out bad service, pointed his behavior out...so I knew it was bad.  We both noticed all the other waitstaff engaged with their customers, read off specials, answered questions, came by to ask if everything was OK and refilled glasses, etc.  Not the same for us.  Someone else brought our food to our table when it was ready (which took nearly 45 minutes after ordering, but we were enjoying the view and bread/butter, so not a problem). We finished our meals and sat with dirty plates in front of us for almost 20 minutes before I saw him and waved him over. When he finally brought the check, he literally dropped it on our table in a pass by on his way to another table. No stopping. No thank you. WOW!  I don't know what to say.  This is not at all what I expected here.  He didn't seem new at his job and surely was trained better.  I was in a good mood and wouldn't let him bring me down so I still tipped him in full and assumed he was having a bad day.  To his benefit, he did wave at us we were walking out the door.\n2. Anchor Steam Fish & Chips.  I don't even want to think about these ever again but I will for the sake of this review.\n\nFood:\n1. Appetizer - 6 raw oysters ($17) - nothing special - they were gritty and needed a proper cleaning before being served. I have tasted better in Japan but they were OK, once you got past the grit, and came with the traditional cocktail and horseradish sauces and lemon (no Tabasco). \n2. The Crab & Shrimp Stuffed Salmon ($35) - Oh. My. God. I could eat this for days.  I wanted to lick the plate clean.  I didn't want this to end. I didn't want to share. The salmon was cooked to perfection and sat in a decadent, yet delicate, cream sauce. The stuffing was delicious and the sides of red peppers and green beans and mashed potatoes were yummy. I did end up sharing half with the kiddo because...\n3. Anchor Steam Fish & Chips ($25) - her order, since she had been craving fish and chips, SUCKED.  It smelled bad, a very fishy odor and definitely not fresh and the fish had a peculiar flavor.  I tried two bites and regretted it since it ruined the beautiful mouth memories I had from my own salmon. The fish was greasy and tasted heavy with oil, even though it was lightly battered. The fries were soggy. The side of coleslaw cut thru the grease a bit but not much. I felt bad for her since she tried my food and wished she had ordered the same. As a good mom, I gave her half my food and we left most of the fried platter alone.\nIMHO, fancy-shmancy restaurants do NOT know how to cook fried fast food type dishes at all and should not even try. Long John Silver would be a yummy and welcomed 10/10 compared to what M&K served as a fried fish and chip platter, which gets a -3/10.  Shame its even on the menu.\n4. We skipped dessert since we were ready to get out of there by the time he came by with the check.", "author": "Nunya B."}

Very tasty and the ingredients complimented each other very well. I got the pacific snapper and my wife had the beef bordelaise. We ended up splitting both because neither of us could decide which we liked better. The beef was so tender and the fish was done perfectly. Very flaky and popped with taste. The sauces for both (bordelaise for the beef and ginger soy for the fish) were done so well they didn't overpower at all. \n\nThe view is amazing as well.

It's now a tourist trap for a good view with poor service and small portioned average overpriced food. On our visit it was 15 minutes after seating before someone came to our table. After ordering drinks and appetizers the appetizers oddly came much before the drinks. Our soups came without spoons. Our table looked right into the kitchen as they never shut its doors.  They were out of 25% of the entrees. The restrooms were disgusting with tp overflowing. When we expressed our discomfort to the manager, Douglas, he was arrogant and condescending without even apologizing. Not exactly the service you'd expect after spending $100+ per person.

They had a buffet system going for us, with the main courses being clam seafood pasta, and beef. Every clam shell that was in the platter either had no clam meat or very negligible morsels, and the overall dish was ridiculously oily. The beef tasted quite rubbery, but at least it was digestible. What really disgusted me was the rock hard bread (you could literally throw it at a window and it will break), and the stale, unimpressive dessert assortment presented after the main course (the only winner in the dessert assortment is the fresh strawberries...at least, I hope it was fresh). \n\nWell, at least the drinks were potent enough to make me temporarily forget the travesty that was the food.

Sherricka was very attentive and friendly, a bit on the quiet/shy side.  She was very knowledgeable regarding the description of the food being served, beers on tap, etc.\n\nThe appetizers (lobster arancini, fritto misto, and crab/mango/avocado tower) were delicious, accordingly to the the rest of the family.\n\nHowever, the restaurant fell short on the entree portion.  Most of the offerings on the limited menu are not typically serviced.  We ordered the filet au poivre, prime rib, duck breast, Chilean sea bass, and stuffed salmon.  The 1st 4 don't appear to be normally served and were all disappointing.  The filet did not have enough of the peppercorn sauce.  The prime rib was mostly fat and lacked flavor.  The duck breast was flavorless and the root vegetables were too \"earthy\" for the meat.  I had asked Sherricka about the duck and she took a slight pause before saying it was good.  I should have picked up on that \"tell\" to realize she really had no idea how the duck breast tasted.  If you really don't know, say you don't know!  The sea bass was good, but not as good as Yard House's offering.  My FIL seemed to enjoy the stuffed salmon, which is on the normal menu.  \n\nDesserts were somewhat missing as well.

The moment you walk into this restaurant you know you are in a fine dinning establishment. The huge windows over looking the water gives you amazing views no matter what time you decide to eat. I can't understand why anyone would give this restaurant a 3 or less star rating. I've read some of the reviews about slow service. They must have never ate in a fine dinning establishment, this is not fast food. Do not rush this experience. \n\nTo start I had the lobster bisque soup. It came well presented and tasted Devine. The flavour of Maine lobster was evident. I was surprised by the pieces of lobster in the soup. I have not had a bisque soup that was not completely liquid. \n\nMy main was the 6oz filet accompanied by a vegetable medley. I also ordered the Yukon gold mash potatoes. I felt that the peppers in the vegetable medley were over cooked but the broccoli was cooked perfectly. The steak came with remanence of butter on top. In my opinion this is cheating a bit but it tasted great none the less. I ordered the steak medium rare and it came as a true medium rare. If you are not used to true medium rare I would suggest ordering your steak medium.  The mash potatoes were smooth and delicious. \n\nAs far as I could tell there was no dress code which brought down the feeling of fine dining a bit.

The turkey appeared to be sliced deli-style sandwich material.  The service was terrible; we saw our waitress when she took our order and then again when she gave us our check.  View?   We were seated in a dungeon area so dark I had to use my cellphone flashlight to read the menu.  Worst Thanksgiving meal I have ever had.  Probably my mistake thinking that no restaurant could screw up a turkey dinner; they better stick to seafood. Oh!  The two bites of cranberry sauce were good.", "author": "Chet F."}

SEVERE FOOD POISONING.\n\nMy friends and I ate here on a trip to San Francisco and wanted to have a nice seafood dinner. Eating here was a massive mistake. My friend and I ordered the same thing and later that night, around the exact same time both got severe food poisoning. My boyfriend tried some of my food and wound up with food poisoning the following day. It is the only place we ate at on our trip that explains which ones of us got food poisoning and when.\n\nMy friend had to be hospitalized due to the food poisoning and I had to see a doctor two days later in order to slow it down. We both missed several days of work.\n\nThis was two months ago and the restaurant sent us on a wild goose chase in order to be compensated. And now, finally, they are refusing to pay my friends hospital bill or accept any responsibility. This restaurant is disgusting and if you value your health we don't recommend eating here. All of use severely regret it.", "author": "Rhianna O."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-04-05", "description": "First walking in, this restaurant has a very interesting and fun theme and layout! It is located right by the water across the plaza from Ghirardelli's Original Ice Cream Square (I think this partly fosters the restaurant's business also)! The interior has stairways and railings that make you feel like you are dining in the interior of a ship or on the docks of the ship, which is really cool! \n\nOverall, the quality of the seafood here is VERY good. However, everything comes in super small quantities and it is really expensive! \n\nFried Calamari ($13): cooked in garlic oil and sprinkled with berries on top! Very interesting mix and it was pretty good. the calamari pieces were very small however :( it is also served with this creamy light green sauce that was very interesting and unique to dip the calamari in\n\nLobster Bisque ($16): very creamy and very rich in flavor! Few huge chunks of lobster meat in it and drizzled with some kind of green pesto sauce that is mixed in. super good and super creamy! \n\nHalibut ($33): cooked with a lemon butter sauce. all seafood entrees come with some sort of vegetables that are cooked and complimented in with the fish to make the dish very colorful. \n\nPan Sear Dry Packed Scallops ($32): with sauteed greens and butternut squash. the scallops were HUGE!!! served on top of this green sauce with olive oil that makes it yummy to dip in. It was really good and definately one of my favorite entrees here! Very well seasoned and tender and moist and yummy and delicious!\n\nExotic Mushroom Sautee ($8): Nothing special. just like regular sauteed mushrooms! Wouldn't order this again :O\n\nThe service was horrible however!!! Very horrible. The host and the hostess were rude and didn't even bother to make eye contact when speaking to us. Our waitors never really tended to us and even the manager at the restaurant seemed to just be fooling around or chit chatting with the fellow waitors and busboys! While we were eating in the restaurant, there would be many tables waiting to be served. However, there will always be at least a group of 3-5+ waitors, manager, or busboys just lingering by a walkway or a stairway chit chatting and talking amongst themselves. The fact that the manager is also included in this made me realize that the management of this restaurant is very oblivious to customer service. \n\nPros:\n-super delicious and creamy lobster bisque soup\n-very good and big scallops\n\nCons:\n-very poor and rude and inattentive service from host, hostess, and waitors\n-expensive\n-very small quantities\n\nHonestly, I would not come back here. This is more of a tourist attraction if anything because of the location next to the pier and the huge attraction from Ghirardelli's Square that pulls customers to here for dinner too!", "author": "Cuc N."}

We intended to come for happy hour but I made reservations on Open Table anyways because I wasn't sure how busy the restaurant would be on a long weekend. We waited 5 minutes for someone to come at the front desk. I told them we have a reservation, and the host asked if we are here for happy hour or early dinner. We said happy hour. He goes on to say \"all right then I will cancel your reservation, just go up to the bar area and find a table\". \n\nThe cancellation of Open Table reservation, I understand. The tone of his voice? So offsetting. \n\nWhen we got to the bar area on the second floor, we saw that it was practically empty, so we asked if we could sit at a dining table right by the bar. The server we asked said \"usually you're not allowed but we'll make an exception\".\n\nWe sit down, we waited. Every time the bar waitress walked by, we asked for some menus. She kept saying \"I'll be right with you\", but we saw her take an order from a table that arrived later than us, and getting refills for other customers. 15 minutes (I kid you not) went by, no water, no menus. Just sass and disregard handed to us on a silver platter. We got up and headed for the exit, and even then no one asked us if something was wrong.\n\nNeedless to say I will never set foot in this restaurant again, or any McCormicks for that matter.", "author": "Ivy W."}

Years ago Kuleto's was reliable for fresh, well-prepared seafood and excellent service. Not anymore. We decided this more, uh, traditional spot was a good venue for my out of state in-law's 56th wedding anniversary. We requested a view table both on the online reservation and in a day-of phone call to the restaurant, during which I was assured they had notes to provide a special table for our anniversary celebration. When we arrived, there was no table ready for our party of seven, so the very rude host told staff to set one up--immediately adjacent to the door--the busiest, coldest part of the restaurant with a view of the CVS pharmacy across the street. They argued with me when I told them that was unacceptable for a party of our size for this very special occasion of which they had been notified well in advance. Once we were finally seated at a decent table, our extremely friendly waiter went on to demonstrate an utter lack of knowledge of just about everything on the menu. I want to be clear that his demonstrated ignorance of the food he was serving is a reflection not so much on him as it is on the restaurant and its management for their clear lack of even a rudimentary staff training program. As an example, my mother in law asked him what rockfish was. His reply, I kid you not, \"I have absolutely no idea what rockfish is ma'am, I hate seafood\". I'm sorry, but when I'm at a $30+ per entree seafood restaurant in San Francisco--on Fisherman's Wharf FFS--I expect the restaurant to ensure staff can thoroughly answer my questions about menu items and, preferably, that they do not gleefully express their hatred of seafood. Moving on, no one had told our poor, untrained waiter that we were there for an anniversary celebration. Upon hearing the reason for our gathering he valiantly tried to make up for his ignorance by bringing out a complimentary desert--one tiny serving only, not even one each for bride and groom--of some sort of chocolate cake plus ice cream plus walnuts, for a group that had clearly advised waiter and kitchen that we had a few nut allergies at the table. After my mother in law doled out benadryl to her husband and my daughter, who both had taken bites before spitting it out when they hit nuts, we decided to cut our losses and wrap it up without an official desert order (did I mention the food was nasty, the tastiest part of the meal was the sourdough?) Unfortunately, our Kuleto's experience didn't end there, well at least not mine. I was the only one at our table who had the mussels, something I used to order weekly at the restaurant's bar with a glass of chardonnay 25 years ago following my friday shift at an art gallery down the street. I was also the only one in our party that spent the hours of midnight to 6:AM after our unfortunate dinner vomiting my guts out. The entire evening was an absolute embarrassment to this native San Franciscan. As much as I love and participate in the modern foodie scene in our fair city, I do make a point of supporting legacy businesses as much as possible. Chains don't typically fall into that category, but with the view and my historical good experiences, I thought McCormick and Kuleto's would be a good choice for my elderly in-laws anniversary. It was the worse possible choice. There are a zillion better places to spend your food dollars in San Francisco, stay away. I still feel robbed. And nauseous.", "author": "Roxie B."}

Stopped in today to relax our feet and grab a drink at the bar tables. It took over 5 minutes for someone to greet us. We ordered drinks: a beer, two Pinot Grigios, and an espresso martini. It took over 10 minutes to get our drinks. As the server brought the drinks over, he spilled the espresso martini all over my father's lap. He apologized immediately and ran to get the manager. We waited another 10 minutes and still NO manager. Not only do they NOT care about the well being of their customers, our bill was not even adjusted at all. My father looks like he wet himself and the blatant disregard for the situation is appalling. I have been a server and bartender for many years and I am utterly disgusted by the way this restaurant handled the situation. Do not waste your time on this crap establishment.\n*Update- the manager finally came out after almost 35 minutes with a horrendous attitude toward both my parents.

So this year for Valentine's we thought to come back. Although the entire dining experience was fine and my dishes were excellent, my boyfriend came home immediately with FOOD POISONING! We don't live far away, so less than hour of leaving the place and settling in at home, he was in the bathroom and having cramps, later the chills.\nHe had the oysters for appetizer and Hawaiian Ahi Tuna for entree. Both dishes are raw and we've had them both before at our last visit. This time however was not the same. I had tried only one oyster and one piece of tune but he finished the rest of the shells and half the serving of fish. Im not sure which it was that got him sick but i threw out the left over tuna in case. Yes, I understand that it is the customer's risk to eat raw foods but when a restaurant claims to be a seafood restaurant with local sources, you expect a slight chance of it actually happening.\nSo please be very cautious that just because the restaurant is \"fancy\" and get \"fresh\" fish, you are still very susceptible to illness. Im so disappointed about their claim for fine quality seafood and paid $200 for my boyfriend to spend our Valentine's weekend in pain.

We got a table pretty quickly and we were seated at a large table facing the huge window with a view of the piers and Alcatraz. The view is unbeatable. The service was impeccable. The food just so-so. My mojito was way too sour - too much lime juice I think, and only a single twig of mint leaf. I like my mojito filled with semi crushed mint leaves so it's refreshing. Anyways, I ordered the lobster bisque soup which was good but a bit salty. My son's spaghetti was also salty, though portion is huge for a kids meal. Hubby's seafood something ravioli looked delicious, but salty as well. Plus it didn't taste like freshly made. Anyways, overall quality is ok, just didn't wow me or anything.

The star is based on our server's great service, but the (probably management and) kitchen are some of the worst I've seen. This was our 2nd trip to SF. 1st time we came here for lunch and everything was great. FF 15mos later and it all went downhill. We came for dinner and will never go back, not even with those great views. For starters I think the host's day was ruined by having to work. 3 adults and 3 kids were in our party. The kids meals were all basic and without complaint. My sister-in-law and I ordered Copper River sockeye and my husband ordered scallops. His wasn't ready with the rest of the meals, and he would have to wait an additional 25min while watching us eat. Then my SIL's fish was completely raw in the center (mine was cooked). She returned it and sat around another for 20min with my husband waiting for food. She received another plate of food with a new piece of salmon and it was more raw than the first piece! My husband's scallops were good albeit so late we could've been done with dinner by then. My SIL gave up on her dinner and ordered another serving of her appetizer. I thought my salmon was ok but spent the night sick in the bathroom because of it. Based on the reviews I'm not the only one who ended up with food poisoning. The server was excellent and obviously embarrassed by the debaucle. I hope for her sake she finds a better job.", "author": "Joanne W."}

Years ago, my husband and I were really impressed with both the food and service. I've always wanted to come back and tonight my husband planned an anniversary dinner date. He read the yelp reviews before making a reservation and thought maybe people were just being too picky. This is a big nope. When he called to make the reservation, the woman he spoke to was very friendly and stated that since it was our anniversary, she would make make a note if it and make sure we had the \"best table in the house\"... We checked in early to have a cocktail at the bar and when we got there the one of the two older gentlemen could not locate our dinner reservation. There was also no note that it was for an anniversary. The hosts had no personality. You really need people to be friendly and welcoming, especially when patrons are coming in. We sat at the bar and enjoyed our drinks along with the company of the bar tender. If I had know better, I would have just stayed at the bar and let him help us the rest of the evening. When we finally sat down, we weren't even acknowledged by our waiter for a long time. We weren't in any rush but at any other restaurant we would have already been welcomed and asked about drinks. We noticed he also had a table of ten meaning there was was no way our 2 person order would compete with but still, we are also paying customers. On top of this, since we look \"young\" waiters have always made us a lower priority even though we are millennials with money to spend. We were served cold bread. The crab cocktail was great but really not worth the price for the portion. I ordered the lobster bisque and my husband was craving clam chowder. The bisque, again, was great. The clam chowder had a weird seasoning and bacon added... Why?? I don't know why restaurants insist on trying to change up clam chowder but this was not what we had wanted at all. For our main course, we decided to split the grilled sturgeon. I was happy to see this on the menu since not many places seem to offer it. The sturgeon was cooked perfectly along with the mashed potatoes. The veggies needed more flavor and the string beans tasted like dirt. We had also ordered a side of the truffle Mac n cheese, but of course, the waiter forgot to put this into the kitchen. When it did come out, it had no flavor and was basically noodles swimming in milk....  disappointing. This restaurant is a great location, has a great view of the bay and a great and beautiful atmosphere but they really need to step it up.

Because M&K seems to be the banquet tradition :P\n\nFirst piece of advice: get the steak and salmon, despite the seemingly exotic seductions of the cod entree. Trust me on this.\n\nBut, but, why should we trust you, Adele? Because I tried both dishes. For banquet, my twin had ordered the duo PETIT FILET MIGNON with sauce bordelaise and GRILLED SALMON with apple reduction lemon butter, served with sides of mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ztTAL3lR65scqrigK4gZqw/l.jpg). It seems that the steaks were all done medium-rare, which greatly upset some people. But the salmon was quite good--not fantastic, but better than the fish I got. Which was the...\n\nROASTED LING COD stuffed with crab, shrimp, brie and a lemon butter sauce, served with julienned vegetables and roasted Fingerling potatoes (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ETeQmzNVY3aP_frjA6gPqA/l.jpg). This dish was a discordant wreck, honestly. I guess I'm not a big fan of cod, as it was fairly tasteless. The crab-shrimp-brie stuffing was way too buttery, and the easily-mushed insides clashed with the rubbery, stringy texture of the cod. The potatoes were sitting in oil and were readily devoured by my twin (hahaha). The only thing I enjoyed on my plate was the steamed vegetables...but the only way they could have messed that up was to have given me rotten vegetables.\n\nWe started with the NEW ENGLAND CLAM CHOWDER, which is thick, creamy, salty, and has a decent amount of clam chunks. Paired with the complimentary bread, it served as a great meal opener for a relatively mediocre meal. We ended with a FLOURLESS CHOCOLATE CAKE (http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/n6iOX1-5GboB1XqooAkRdA/l.jpg), which had a pleasing raspberry reduction. But, I have this thing about flourless cakes: you either go dense and velvety, or you go moist and fudgy. And this cake didn't quite hit either, with its somewhat airy texture and borderline semisweet tones. It wasn't bad, but the fact that I wasn't stealing helpings of everyone else's slices says something.\n\nSince I came for a huge group banquet, M&K was a fantastic social experience. The dining area is expansive and provides a great backdrop of San Francisco. Service was subpar, as I had to satisfy my unquenchable thirst by downing everyone else's water. And I've heard that this place has a great happy hour, though the speed to get drinks at the bar seems to say otherwise. For most fancy expensive meals, I try to concentrate on the food, but for once I was glad to have had company to distract me from the mediocre mass-produced entrees that lowlighted this evening.", "author": "Adele F."}

He told me the restaurant was completely booked and that we could sit in the bar and it happens to be the same menu. First of all about 3/4 of the tables in the restaurant where empty. But we went upstairs and sat at the bar. A few minutes later I could hear him telling a group of three something similar. That group happened to come up to the bar and we asked them what did the person at the front desk say.  They were told that they would have a 40 minute wait  to be seated.  They had not made a prior reservation, just as we had not. Yet they were told in 40 minutes they could be seated and we were told the restaurant was completely booked. And we came in before they did.

And while I don't really care what people think about my life choices, it's a bit weird to tell your friends that you had a good time at said chain restaurant while they wax poetic about the virtues of State Bird Provisions, etc. \n\n\"Oh, that Keane. He's so pedestrian.\"\n\nI am, in fact, a proud pedestrian.\n\nI first sampled McCormick & Kuleto's during a Yelp Elite Event many years ago. Brunch items were served and we had ample servings of Bloody Marys. I had an amazing time, of course. The morning view of the water was stunning and the staff were hospitable. I didn't think this experience counted, as I was heavily soused and the entire restaurant was closed just for us; it wasn't representative of how the restaurant normally functions with customers. \n\nMy second time here was for brunch several years later. I was immediately amazed by the great prices for a restaurant with a view of the waterfront. They also provide large mimosas and a diverse offering of Bloody Marys for around $6 per drink. The food was phenomenal (I ordered the Ahi Ni\u00e7oise Salad), there was no wait to get in and we got a table right by the giant windows. I've never had an easier brunch experience in San Francisco. Ever.\n\nThe most recent visit was for dinner. This was a more elegant experience, though it's a casual restaurant. I had the Stuffed Atlantic Salmon, which was an orgasm in the mouth (that is honestly the best way to describe it -- it should also be noted that they use locally sourced produce and seafood whenever possible). But what made it even more fun was that my friend was acquainted with the \"Wow\" Manager of the restaurant, Geoffrey Faller. He told us fun stories and made sure we had a great time. The waitress we had was also really friendly, and the two of them brought out a lighthearted attitude that made the whole experience unique.\n\nSo, as science will tell us, sometimes it takes several conclusions to conclusively say whether a thing is true.

I had been here once before but was looking forward to their lauded but ever elusive happy hour since I could never get here by 6pm. \n\nAt first glance, the food deals are truly good. I mean a half pound cheeseburger with fries for $4? Can't argue there. Since I was at McCormicks, I knew I wanted some sort of seafood and hence the mussels with the romesco sauce and lemon aioli but there was definitely no way I was going to say no to a fried chicken slider. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mccormick-and-kuletos-san-francisco?select=0000Qq9Jh8cmDZ_iszCY2g#0000Qq9Jh8cmDZ_iszCY2g) Alas the food was decent but not great. I liked the mussels and the rich and nutty romesco sauce. The sliders however were disappointing. Squashing the biscuit down defeated the purpose since it made it tough versus fluffy and flakey. Here's my tip: take the top off and use it a a vessel to soak up the romesco sauce and eat the fried chicken and jalepeno aioli like an open-faced sandwich. Done. \n\nAll in, it's a decent happy hour at McCormick & Kuleto's but with no drink specials and beers on tap at $7.50, the allure of the happy hour starts to pale considering other options around. Still worth it to stop by for a quick bite on a gorgeous San Francisco day though.", "author": "Jon L."}

Sometimes people have bad experiences which I compare to the good ones. This place def. had a trend of more bad reviews than good ones. \n\nI got a $100 American Express e-gift card for Christmas and thought it would be a good idea to buy the $80 for $100 dinner from costco online to take my fianc\u00e9 out for a valentines dinner. Based on my statement above, I decided to give the place a shot since it would give us a reason to go to San Fran, have a semi free dinner and enjoy ourselves. \n\nOnce we were seated we started to notice ALL the bad review trends come alive. First off, before we even ordered we saw a food runner bring food near our area and not not where he was going with it. He asked us if this was our food, then went to another table and asked them which we both said no. The waiter finally came around and pointed him in the correct direction. No joke, this happened three times within a 20 min time period - I actually found this quite comical. \n\nWe ordered two appetizers and some wine to begin. The clams came out to our table after the food runner tried bringing it to another table, lol. They had cut up sausage in the sauce? When does spicy sausage get served with clams? Anyway, it wasn't that great. I ordered filet and lobster tail for dinner. The lobster tail was not good at all. However, the filet mignon was really good!!! I was surprised I found a diamond in the rough. It still wasn't worth the price. My fianc\u00e9 ordered their special (lobster tail with crab). The crab was full of mayonnaise plopped on top of her lobster tail. Gross. Not worth the price. \n\nWe spent $180 on two appetizers. Two $50 lobster tail entrees and four glasses of wine. Didn't care too much since half of it was free, but will never come back here again. \n\nI gave two stars because the filet was really good.", "author": "Mike J."}

I'm not sure about most people but when a fly flys on your food you lose your appetite completely. THE SMASHED FLYS ON THE WINDOWS KILLED IT ALL. Then they have the nerve to charge me for the food that I didn't eat. We ordered two dishes my uncle ate one but lost his appetite after seeing that huge ask fly. The nerve for the manager whom was wearing glasses and bald head to say I have to pay for the fish my uncle ate like wtf he was so rude I told him we're not paying for ANYTHING AFTER SEEMING THAT HUGE HORSE FLY AND SMASHED ONES ON THE WINDOW HELL NO! I told him I refuse to pay for this service he kept going back and forth with me finally said its fine go on about your way.

Last year, and again this year my colleagues selected this restaurant for our group dinner. I had a very so-so experience last year, and this year my experience was genuinely bad.\n\nWe had reservations for our party of 10. When our group was complete, we were seated promptly, but not given menus by the host. We waited for a full ten minutes before a server arrived to take drink orders. We then had to ask him for menus, which it took him a few minutes to obtain.\n\nDrink orders followed, and were filled, and the server nicely agreed to provide us with separate checks. We then had a pretty long wait to finally order food. We ordered calamari, clam chowder or salad, and entrees.\n\nThe calamari, clam chowder and salads were delivered in a fairly reasonable timeframe, and consumed. The calamari was good, and the clam chowder was rich and savory, but lacked substance in the form of vegetables and clams. We then waited and waited (at least 40 minutes) for our entrees to arrive. \n\nMy dish, the Pan Seared Sea Scallops from the Featured Items section of the menu, looked ok, but my first bite of the butternut puree was extremely salty. My first fork of the saut\u00e9ed greens was so salty that they left my tongue with a stinging sensation. That saltiness was what had permeated the puree. The dish was completely inedible.\n\nWhen the server returned after a few minutes with the last of the entrees, I explained the problem. He took the plate away and returned in about 10 minutes with a freshly made plate, with freshly cooked greens. The scallops were just warm, were on the small side, didn't have much of a sear or much seasoning, but thankfully were not over cooked. For a $32 dish, this didn't cut it. It wasn't inedible like the original dish, and I was hungry, so I ate most of it. I wasn't tempted to clean my plate.\n\nBeyond my own complaint, my companions indicated that the Petrale Sole was very dry, and the single order of White Clam Linguini was bland, going un-eaten after the first taste. As the table was cleared, the completely full dish was taken away without question at to why.\n\nEveryone was tired and ready to leave (we had been there for 2 1/2 hours) and so we opted to have dessert and coffee elsewhere (rather than have another lengthy wait), and requested our checks. We all agreed that we had been there too long.\n\nTo his credit, our server produced our separate checks relatively quickly, and without complaint. We were not charged an automatic gratuity as a large party, which was refreshing. My check for chowder, and the scallop entr\u00e9e (no drinks) was $44, and not a good value for the food quality. \n\nAs I indicated at the start, my first experience here last year wasn't one that caused me to want to go back. This year, I yielded to the organizer tried to give it a second chance. In the future, I will pass on dining here.\n\nI have enjoyed McCormick & Schmick's in Arizona (before they closed) and Minnesota, and will visit them again, but NOT this restaurant ever again.", "author": "Faridah S."}

We figured they would provide the perfect view over the water for a nice Valentine's dinner. \nWe arrived a half hour prior to our reservation, checked in, and went to the bar to wait. The bar was of course full and busy, but we were still able to get bartended and find a small table. We ordered a couple of their specialty drinks, one of which they forgot to serve with its lemon sugared rim (described on the cocktail menu) and the other they ran out of. A waiter came to find us at the bar when our table was ready which was about 30 minutes past the scheduled reservation. He took us to our table and shortly after our waiter came with our menus.\nI had original received a phone call from the restaurant a few days before Valentine's day to confirm the reservation and at the time I asked if there was going to be a set menu for that specific day or if the regular menu would be available. I was told that there would be no special menu, but when we looked at our menu that night, it was a completely new, set menu. We ordered something off the new menu, only to have our waiter come back 20 minutes later and tell me they had run out of the entr\u00e9e I ordered, so I chose I new entr\u00e9e. 10 minutes later my waiter comes back to tell me that they ran out of the side I ordered so I choose a new one off the set menu. My boyfriend went all out that night and ordered the most expensive entr\u00e9e, Surf n Turf, which was listed on the menu as King Crab Legs and filet mignon. When he received his plate it had nothing more than a third of a crab leg and a steak the size and thickness of the smallest pork chop you can imagine.

Let me preface by saying that this part of town is not exactly my cup of tea, filled with tourists in shorts and San Francisco sweatshirts.  Celebrating my dad's 90th, not an easy feat, making a dinner reservation here was an automatic.  Here's what we had:\n\nAppetizers (shared)\n1) Steamed mussels - Cooked in a white wine sauce with small sausage pieces, this was tasty.  The sauce made for great bread dipping.\n\n2) Fried calamari - Served with marinara sauce, it was okay and as expected.\n\n3) Gazpacho with dungeness crab (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=04bWiWOT2JEd0HN2IxCcOg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Seasonal summery soup perfectly complemented by the buttery avocado and tasty crab meat.\n\nEntree\n4) Jumbo shrimp scampi with linguini (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=lvo0Go3jmjYm3r559kSH5w&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Opting for a lighter entree after a heavy lunch, this fit the bill.  The tomatoes and garlic were enough flavoring for both the pasta and the shrimp.\n\nBecause of an evening appointment, I was unable to share the recommended banana cream pie dessert.  Because we were here for an early dinner (6:15 pm reservations), the dining room was just filling up as I left with area locals, Japanese tourists, and romantic couples.  The combination of relatively large menu choices, a panoramic Bay view, and efficient service makes this a popular dining destination. Despite being less than a frequent regular, the host remembered me and spoke to me like a long lost friend.  The personal birthday wish on each of our menus brought smiles to us and left a lasting impression.  By pure coincidence, during our birthday toast, our neighboring table asked about my dad's age and told us that they were also celebrating their dad's 90th birthday this same evening.  When he returned from the lieu, my dad and he shared birthday wishes and talked about their backgrounds.

Not only did we wait a ridiculous 30 some minutes for a bowl of soup but we watched as the two African American women in the bar were told to wait some 15-20 mins (just for drinks). All the while he was ever attentive as he served 4 Caucasian women. When we asked to speak to the manager we heard the bartender tell him to transfer us to anyone else. \n\nThe food - the soup finally arrived literally less than 3 minutes after we complained about the wait almost immediately. It was delicious but soured by the taste of negligence and racial profiling. \n\nI used to work for this company when I was 18 - I started as a host. I quit because the guest told me \"this is why your kind should work in the back or go back to your own country\" and my manager responded \"the customer is always right.\"", "author": "Collette M."}

So on his week visit I made a point to take him to places that were a little more high brow than Golden Corral (his favorite restaurant).\n\nI knew he didn't get out much when they put bread and butter on the table and the butter was in those little golf balls and he pointed at it and asked what they were.\n\nWe were sat promptly in a booth raised up over the bottom floor with a beautiful view of the water and park.\n\nThey had specials that included all Lobster.  My little brother wanted only a bowl of Mussels.\n\nI wanted a simple salad with ranch dressing.  No, I had to order a salad on their salad menu.  I went with the Baby Greens Salad.  Its not what I wanted and it sucked on top of that.  \n\nI'm also not supposed to eat unpasteurized cheeses (pregnancy rule) and this one had Blue Cheese Crumbles.  I had to pick most of them off.  The candied Walnuts were good.  I picked most of those out and ate them.   They just really need to put a basic salad on their menu with a choice of dressings.\n\nFor my main meal I had the Lobster Bisque.  They served it in a bowl with little pile of Lobster meat in the middle then poured the Bisque over the top. \n\nI could tell the Bisque was sitting out because there was a skin on it when he poured it in front of me.  It also got cold really fast too.  That's how I knew it had been sitting out.\n\nIt was good though.  Not the best Lobster Bisque in the world but it worked for the moment.\n\nMy brother loved his mussels.  The broth smelled really good and I talked him into sopping it up with bread when he was done.  I wish I could have had some too. (Another pregnancy no-no)\n\nThey had an extensive cocktail menu and would like to come back and bring my husband to enjoy them.  Possibly give the food another chance.", "author": "Ivy R."}

We checked in to the hosts and they told us to wait in the bar. We waited in the bar for 40 minutes, checking in with the hosts on multiple occasions during that time. They repeatedly told us that our table was still being made... for 40 minutes. Finally they told us our table was ready, and our group sighed in relief as we sat down. Little did we know...\n\nIt took 5 minutes for the waitress to finally acknowledge us. She took our drink order (mainly water) and we politely asked for her to bring us bread. For the next 20 minutes we waited and waited, no bread or drinks in sight. We asked every waiter, host, and bus boy that walked by if they would please bring us our long overdue drinks and bread. After asking 6 different times, the drinks came out, but only a few of them. We had to ask again for the other drinks, and they said, \"Right away.\" It was not \"right away;\" it took another 5 minutes. \n\nThe drinks finally arrived but our bread was still not to be seen. We asked the next waiter we saw if he would get the manager. The manager came and we asked him for bread. A few minutes later, he brought us bread, but not nearly enough for a party of this size. My mother asked if he could bring us more bread and he snarked, \"You have to be patient, ma'am.\" He then mumbled passive aggressive remarks under his breath. He brought us one more small plate of bread and acted like he was doing us a huge favor.\n\nAt this point, our water had not been refilled once, even after asking twice. In addition, the preset wine glasses were left on the table, even though no one ordered wine. Upscale restaurants typically follow the etiquette of removing wine glasses if no one orders wine, but not McCormick & Kuleto's. \n\nOnce our appetizers arrived, we had lost our will to eat. Our entrees took another 12 minutes to arrive, but came out at staggered times. The food wasn't bad, luckily, but was not up to the standard we expect when paying such exorbitant amounts.\n\nAll in all, I am HIGHLY displeased with my experience at McCormick & Kuleto's. The workers are rude and inattentive, the manager is pretentious, and the food was NOT worth the wait. DO NOT GO.", "author": "Deanna M."}

While the views and the restaurant itself are very nice, the service was unfriendly and the food was mediocre, especially for the price. Everyone I came here with ordered steaks and a variety of sides: mac & cheese, gnocchi, mushrooms, asparagus. They were not impressed. I had a taste of my son's mac & cheese-it was bland and had a strange texture. I ordered the cioppinio and the broth was flavorful but it only came with one small crostini and the seafood was mostly calamari. Where I come from, we use squid as bait so..

My husband didn't like the steak - not enough char and a bit on the blander side. My other cousins had the Cioppino - tasty if you can ignore the fact that the crab legs were gamey. The meat also had a powdery consistency which means it wasn't fresh. I had the halibut and it was perfectly cooked and flakey. No complaints there. The side dish of mushrooms were yummy.\n\nWe ordered more wine towards the end which took forever to come. The waiters kept bringing the food to the wrong person.

We had four separate couples and two individuals but he gave us one check. Then he tried to get us to sign up for a rewards card by making it seem like they would take 25$ off meal.

This place was a bold yet hidden gem for years in SF, but my last visits have been strangely underwhelming. \n\nThe view is the same, the decor is the same, the outfits and staff look about the same, the food seems about the same, but something isn't right. It's kind of on the periphery of your vision. Little but important mistakes the waiter makes, ham-handed sloppiness in the food prep, mix ups and quantity of food going down... And the outright insult was the phony bill tack-on hidden in small type at the menu bottom stating something to the effect of \"5% extra will be added to your bill FOR THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS IN SAN FRANCISCO.\" Jeezus Christmas! \n\nI know some restaurant owners are still pissed off that the $2.20/hr food handlers are now \"entitled\" to healthcare and maybe a sick day, but if that is hurting your bottom line then just RAISE AND LIST THE PRICES TO WHAT YOU WILL ACTUALLY BE CHARGING! Do you really think the tourists and business drones on expense accounts will balk and eat at Lori's instead when the tiny hunk of iceberg is honestly listed at $10.49 rather than passive-aggressively misrepresented as costing $9.99? SF business owners, give it a rest and just list the price you want us to pay IN ONE PLACE! Grow some balls! Do you hide a 5% DISCOUNT at the bottom of your restaurants in cheaper towns for the \"cost of doing business\" for the lax regulations and vulnerable workers you employ? Same logic.\n\nI understand one issue affecting the quality of McCormick and Kuleto's is the recent sale to a chain that runs Bubba Gumps and some other iffy places.

So it was quite a relief that our special family dinner in San Francisco turned out so well. \n\nThis location has very special significance for members of our family and the views make you fall in love with San Francisco all over again. We did a few things right when planning our group dinner. Our reservation was made for an early seating, so we had very warm and personal service throughout our meal. We had a lovely large table near the end on the main level so it almost felt like a private dining room.\n\nEven though we had a large party and requested several alterations to the standard menu to accommodate vegetarians, kids, etc. everything came as specifically ordered without the server writing down a single note. She was totally on her game. They also had very good, reasonably priced options on the kids' menu.\n\nWe were there to celebrate a very special birthday and when we arrived the daily menu had a personal birthday greeting printed on the top, she was greeted by the staff and given a lovely chocolate dessert at the end of our meal. She was treated very well on her special day and all the little touches made for a memorable evening.\n\nThe only downside was that I ordered the wrong thing. One of those 'looks good on paper' miscues, so I was the only one who didn't enjoy my meal. I do not recommend the pan seared sea scallops with Roasted Snake River Farms Kurobuta Pork Belly and lentils. My prior experiences with M&S should have taught me to keep it simple and order one of the fresh items of the day simply prepared, but instead I took a risk and it didn't pay off.\n\nEven though we had a lovely evening, this isn't the place I'd typically choose when visiting San Francisco, but for this particular event and group it was just right.", "author": "Jen K."}

I've been to McCormick & Schmitt's so I wouldn't necessarily go here for dinner with so many local choices nearby. (Although the food is undoubtedly fresh)\n\nThis is simply the best happy hour in Fisherman's Wharf for someone who wants a cheap meal and some inexpensive drinks. First of all, a mixed drink with house liquor is $5. The house pours aren't terrible and the best part is they make their drinks with freshly squeezed juice which makes all the difference in the world. For $5 you will get a generous pour of house booze and then the bartender will cut and orange in half and squeeze both halves into your glass with a large press. Great screwdriver!\n\nThe happy hour menu almost looks like a misprint. $3.99 for a 1/2 lb. cheeseburger with fries? And this is one of the best cheeseburgers I have had! Not some miniscule microwaved slider. The steamed clams for $5.99 come with the most amazing butter/garlic sauce. They will give you some extra sourdough bread to eat it with. Where else can you get a meal and a drink for around $10?\n\nThe bar is classy with lots of wood ... and the giant panoramic glass windows look right out into the Bay. You can see all the boats and Alcatraz. Seats at the bar aren't always easy to find ... they do have some tables as well. Happy hour runs from 3-6 (I believe) Monday through Friday (I believe).\n\nHonestly, there is something great about getting a good deal. Obviously, I'd pay for quality ... but trust me, you will be telling your friends about the best $4 cheeseburger you ate one day. This place is a happy hour legend.

Comes with a lemon aioli sauce and a butter sauce. Both sauces complimented the delicate little lobster pieces well in their own way. Totally delicious and somewhat worth the $20 pricetag for 6 little pieces.\n\nJumbo Shrimp Linguini - Big shrimps, a lot of noodles, and no flavor. Lightly seasoned with olive oil but nothing special. Date was probably hoping for more of a cream sauce and was mildly disappointed. \n\nGrilled Capino (?) - Also in their Spring Specials. A dense buttery fish grilled to perfection. The sides though were less than the best to pair with my fish. A jalapeno popper; not even a good one at that. Jalapeno popper was very mushy and fell apart upon the first touching of my fork.

However, I was assured by my fellow work colleagues that McCormick & Kuleto's was different. How right they were, but not for the reason you'd expect.\n\nFull disclosure -- I've eaten at several McCormick & Schmick's. I've dined at the Atlanta location probably half a dozen times over the last few years. One thing guaranteed at good chain restaurants is consistency. I've always had a decent experience at M&S. Not so M&K.\n\nThere are three redeeming qualities of this Bay area tourist trap. First, the location. Fisherman's Wharf offers excellent views of Maritime Park and the ocean. Second, the interior decor is quite lovely, with an upscale nautical theme. Finally, the drinks are excellent. I started with a ginger and lime caipirinha, and it was everything I'd hoped it would be -- strong, not too sweet, and quite refreshing. I'd planned to drink it with the appetizers our table ordered: oysters on the half shell; crab cakes; shrimp cocktail; mussels. Alas, my glass was drained, the sourdough bread basket was empty, and our entire group was reduced to sad, longing looks at the food trays that passed our table before our server returned. \n\nExcept, it wasn't our server. It was someone, perhaps a manager, since she was not dressed like the other servers, coming over to take additional drink orders. Not to introduce herself, not to apologize for the 45-minute wait or explain the delay. Just to see if we'd care for anything else to drink. Curious.\n\nAfter the drinks were delivered, our appetizers finally made their grand entrance. (Again, not by our original server.) As hungry as we were, we should have been overjoyed with the presentation of the seafood platters. Unfortunately, the oysters were uncleaned and gritty. Tasty enough, but for the price they should have been more carefully plated. The mussels with chorizo were decent, but I could have used more sourdough bread to sop up the sauce. (Service disappeared again as soon as the plates were down.) The crab cakes and shrimp were so-so, and so not worth the price.\n\nWe were all ready to hit Ghirardelli's for dessert when our entrees finally showed. The restaurant boasts their cioppino is the best in San Francisco, but my table-mates disagreed. The seafood was good and fresh, but the sauce was on the weird side, with little of the rich tomato broth in sight. My sashimi entree was okay - the local salmon was the tastiest of the three fish served - but for the price it was a disappointment. Sensing a trend here? \n\nWe skipped coffee and dessert in favor of Ghiradelli's. It turned out to be the right call.\n\nBad service, unexceptional and inconsistent seafood dishes, and high prices. Also, great views, lovely decor, and fine libations. Your call.", "author": "Maria S."}

It was a sponsored event so I can't comment on prices or value, but thought it would be useful to give an evaluation of food quality and service.\n\nThe dinner was served buffet style and I tried a bit of everything.  Spinach salad was a welcome sight and I loaded up on uniformly fresh leaves full of iron and B vitamins.  The roasted vegetables and the garlic roasted potatoes were good.  But the main dishes of chicken and fish were tasteless.  A good chicken breast is tender enough to be cut with a fork, but it took maximum force from my massive triceps to cut this one with a fork.  The desert was a tall, light tiramisu, which was good, but could have been better if served chilled instead of at room temperature and slowly tilting over like the leaning tower of pizza.   \n\nAnd that brings up service.  It was bad to the point of being comical.  All of the food at the buffet was cooked, but by the time it was served it was room temperature (and they did not use anything to warm it at the buffet). The tiramisu had been sitting awhile before serving also.  I could not communicate with any of the waiters in English and had to give my empty dinner plate to one of them to make room to move the desert in front of me.  Final blunder was the waiter who reached over 2 people to pour coffee for one of our group.

We started with the crab cake and calamari which were both good (I liked the crab cake more). \n\nFor my entree, I ordered the 8 oz. filet mignon and requested that it was cooked medium-rare. When it came it out, it looked delicious! However, when I cut into the corner of it, it was pretty well-done. I thought, \"Okay, that was just the thin corner so the middle should be perfect.\" I cut straight into the middle to check and it was medium-well (dry-ish pink in the middle, not juicy at all). I brought this to our server's attention who took it back to the kitchen. My friend got the 9 oz. top sirloin and requested medium-rare but her's came out medium-well too (they took hers back also).\n\nIt was probably at most another 15-20 minutes for our replacements to come out. They served the sirloin first and it was perfect. Mine took another minute to come out and it looked okay at first. I cut into one portion, more -- pink than the first one I was served. I decided to cut into the thickest part to make my conclusion and it was still medium-well. How is it possible to mess up a filet mignon TWICE?! I tried to eat some but it didn't taste good at all. \n\nThe manager or general manager came to find out if the replacements were more to our expectation and I flat out said, \"No.\" I showed him that it was still overcooked. He apologized for the inconvenience again and offered to have another one made. I declined as most of my friends were already done with their food and that I'd just eat the vegetables served with the filet mignon. To be honest, I don't think the third would have been any better. He then offered to comp any desserts we wanted.\n\nSo there's that.\n\nFor desert, the rest of my friends shared an espresso creme brulee which was so-so. I had a slice of blueberry cheesecake for myself which was pretty good. We were given our bill and looked over the deductions. We noticed that I was still getting partially charged for the filet mignon and needed to let our server know. While waiting for her to come back around, I started to get severe stomach pains. I had to excuse myself to the restroom and that was not a fun experience. We were able to get the bill figured out in the end but I ended up getting sick from something.

Once we were seated, I asked the hostess to show me to the restroom.  She led me across the hardwood floors towards the stairs and as I took my first step, I slipped and fell down all 6 stairs in my fancy New Year's gown.  It was embarrassing and very painful.  The hostess and one of the servers asked me if I was okay and all I wanted to do was escape to the bathroom to hide.\n\nWhen I returned to the table my left hip was radiating with heat and I was very shaky.  The server said he heard me fall.  When I mentioned that the floor was slippery he responded sarcastically, \"Oh, so it's our fault you fell.\"  I didn't care for that remark.\n\nThe Oysters and Crab Cakes were excellent.  The cucumber martini was also delicious.  I ordered the Chef's Duck special and my husband ordered a filet with Point Reyes blue cheese.  Both were good, not great.\n\nWhen we received our bill ($300 with 25% tip for 3 people - we never skimp on the server's tip, especially on a holiday) I was surprised that nobody had come by the table to make sure I was alright.  I wasn't looking for sympathy, nor for my bill to be discounted, but come on!!!  In these situations a manager needs to check on the guest to make sure everything is okay.  I left very disappointed and very bruised.\n\nFor the next 2 days I was in bad shape and it hurt to walk.  I am now sitting on my left cheek because I am black and blue on the right side.

It would be nice if he had told us that.\nMy boyfriend ordered the clam chowder. They add bacon to it which I found rather odd. \nI ordered the snapper with a lime sauce. The lime sauce overpowered the fish and the zucchini side that came with it was rather bland. The boyfriend had the scallops.

Kaori helped us with the planning, decision making and was very clear on their expectations.  They allowed us to drop off 3 large bins of decorations and they did all the decorating the morning of the wedding. And they did it perfectly. It was the perfect location for photos - the bride & groom even had their picture taken on a cable car! All the staff worked hard to meet our every need and make sure the day went smoothly. This is the perfect San Francisco venue with delicious food and beautiful views. Plus it's nice to have the parking garage right underneath so people don't have to circle around looking for street parking.", "author": "Laura S."}

I think maybe if I ordered something else, I would have enjoyed the meal more. Overall, I do think this place is worth another try and I would come back.

You see, Pat Kuleto is a legendary fixture in the SF restaurant scene, and with his name attached to the project, it takes less of a corporate structure, and adheres itself to a local frame of mind. So for those who wouldn't dream of stepping foot inside due to the horrific notion of supporting something other than a mom and pop operation, rest assured you actually are supporting something with a local tie in.\n\nWith that being said, there's a lot to love about this particular establishment. They have a kick ass happy hour that's always changing, but it's always guaranteed to be an amazing deal, and the views of the San Francisco Bay from the northern area of the leeway can't be beat. Seriously, the glances you take in from the Captain's Room and the Bayview Room are rivaled by nobody in this 7X7 stretch of land we occupy. On a nice day, a hearty meal and a glass of bubbly by the large bay windows are just the thing to put you in the mood for an easy, breezy day on the coast. \n\nParking in the area can be a bit of a nightmare, so plan accordingly, or better yet... be kind to the environment and take a bus!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

The restaurant is pretty and I'm sure the view would be lovely during the daytime. The service was generally good but I thought the solicitation to join their loyalty club was kind of awkward. \n\nAs for the food, the delicious included the Miyagi oysters, beet salad, clams, crab cakes and most of the fish entrees (some salmon iterations and one of the white fish). I'd say the scallops were just okay for $30 - I received two large scallops and two small ones, and the cauliflower mash it came with was too heavy and buttery. I was also told the steaks were average as well. Stay away from the cioppino though - tons of limp calamari and the soup was a bit too tart for my liking. \n\nI would have given it 4 stars if the prices were more reasonable, but I think if you're going to charge $30-$40 per entree, your food should be pretty amazeballs. Would def come back to try out their lauded happy hour, though! \n\nPARKING: They validate in the Ghiradelli square garage for 90 minutes for $2 and then usual pricing after that. Don't know what the usual pricing is, but I think 90 minutes is definitely not long enough for dinner.

An apology that our food was accidentally delivered to another party and we would have to wait just a few more minutes.  We were totally fine and thought an apology from the chef was just not necessary at all.\n\nOur dishes came out minutes after the Chef talked to us and it was delicious.

I mean, we ain't high class to demand a new plate, we ain't low class either and went ghetto on the waiter and refused to pay for the meal. We just want them to do the right thing.

After that excitement, our waiter, Josh, comes and greets us with a genuine smile, fills our glasses and kept the atmosphere light when I saw a spot on my dirty glass (which he changed out quickly); he returns with my new glass, and at that point he politely offers some recommendations for appetizers; we went with his suggestion: the mango-avocado salad.  A light, flavorful dish, that's not too filling, but enough to hold you 'til the entrees arrive.  I like how the salad, though it seemed like enough for 1 - 2 persons, was just enough for us to \"sample\" so gives us something to look forward to next time.\n\nMoving on to the entrees, I had the stuffed Atlantic salmon, another one of Josh's recommendations.  The fish was cooked to my liking: moist and tender, very flavorful...no fishy taste whatsoever.  Great recommendation, Josh!\n\nDessert: Upon arriving at McCormick & Kuleto's, the 6 chocolate dessert offerings quickly caught my eye.  Yes, I am a sucker for sweets and couldn't help picking out what dessert I'm possibly going to have; so many looked so yummy.  Since 3/4 of us are little - not lactose, we each picked a chocolate dessert, while 1 of us picked out the fruit tart.  Needless to say, too bad the chocolate desserts were only offered for a limited of time.  I would've gone back, just for the dessert...lol. Delightful and decadent.  I was expecting something heavy, but to my surprise, the desserts were definitely light and flavorful; a very nice touch to the end of our meal.  \n\nFor a chain restaurant, this place is pretty good; If the manager is reading this, I'd suggest promoting Josh, or at least raising his pay; If he's taken them, he must've taken his Hospitality Management courses seriously because he definitely knows how to take care of his clients; he's able to strike up a light conversation; able to catch any mistakes/errors (ex: dirty glassware, drops something, etc.) before clients say anything, all while keeping the atmosphere light when catching such errors;  provides great recommendations; seems very genuine in making sure guests are comfortable, enjoying their food, atmosphere, and environment -- never hurries us out even when the dinner rush was beginning.  We pretty much ate from sunrise (sun was still bright early evening) to sundown.  And by the time we were done, our tummies were full...time for a stroll in Ghiradelli Square!", "author": "Jessica S."}

We had a small group of friends and family join us for the day and I used the Dolphin Room at McCormick & Kuleto's for our private dinner afterward. My then fiance and I had visited so many place in the city but everything seemed either too pricey, or kinda boring. I really wanted somewhere with ambiance and a view. The room here was perfect because they have a low minimum to reserve the room and the view can't be beat. \n\nSo why the 1 star rating? Service. Terrible, terrible service. Our event coordinator, Linda, takes the majority of the blame here. From pretty much day one, she failed to respond to phone calls and emails, she promised to \"get that to you today\" or \"send that before I go on vacation\" but never did. The only way to get the information we needed was repeatedly contacting her. \n\nFast forward to the night of the dinner. Here's a few things that went wrong to name a few: \n1. Linda, while on the premises, was no where to be seen. Even when my friends arrived early to set up different items for our \"reception\" she made no appearance. \n2. Our wishes were ignored as far as seating our guests. We'd paid for appetizers for our guests to keep them occupied while we took some pictures. They were to be served on the patio. That didn't happen. They were served in the dining room and so guests went ahead and sat down. I had no chance to get pictures of the room before it was \"used\" looking. \n3. We were told that some appetizers would be held for my new husband and I to sample when we arrived. This didn't happen. When we did track down Linda to ask about it, she sent down totally different appetizers than what had been served to our guests, including a seafood item even though she new I am allergic to seafood and it was on our contract. \n4. After pictures, we were driving over to the venue and one guest texted us that they were already taking dinner orders. Are you kidding me? Not only did guests get seated early, but they started taking orders before the bride and groom had arrived??? So so bad. \n5. The food was......bland, to say the least. More than one of my guests sent there dinner back because it was in-editable. \n6. Finally, the cash bar. More than one guest told me that different liquors that were served upstairs in the main restaurant were not available to them at my event , even after they had asked. This sent my guests upstairs to the bar to buy drinks which took away from my minimum food and beverage cost. So, so disappointing. \n\nI would not suggest this place at all for an event. Of all of the different vendors I've worked with, this was the worst. There are a lot of restaurants in San Francisco, so keep looking.", "author": "Gina J."}

This meal was the one that I compared all other fine steak houses to until this past weekend.\n\nThe service was terrible! It's rare that we leave less than 18%, but this girl got about 15.5% and she should consider herself lucky! The food was okay. My steak was nothing special, and the julienne vegetables were coated in garlic, so I opted out of eating them. Husband had the shrimp trio special and he was in heaven. Mom ordered a pork chop and she said it was extremely dry. Dad had macadamia nut crusted mahi mahi and he said that was good. The garlic mashed potatoes were the crowning achievement of dinner, they felt like silk on the tongue, and you couldn't taste the garlic at all. \n\nMy mom ordered a drink, the \"Southern Belle\" and as I sat at the table thinking that our food was taking a ridiculous amount of time, here comes our server with my mom's drink she had literally ordered about 20 minutes before.

My mom wanted hot sauce, she brought us tabasco and then brought some chili flakes. That made my moms day. For the main course we ordered the surf and turf. Now I like my steak to bleed on the plate but I always order medium rare. The meal did take a long time to come so we order sides of some veggies too a la carte. We got the asparagus, spinach and the mushrooms.

It took them 20 minutes to bring us water, another 20 to being us bread, 15 minutes to take our order, 25 minutes to get an appetizer, another 25 to get our entrees, and 15 minutes just to get a refill on our drinks (another after having to remind our server). People who had arrived well after we had been seated were getting served their bread, water, and drinks In short order followed by a wait of No more than 5-10 minutes for their appetizers. This severely got on my nerves.  I asked to speak to a manager and The manager gave no sign that she was even concerned or cared.  She even had the nerve to bring The server over to us to talk when we wanted to voice our problems with our server making it awkward.  \n\n\nMy girlfriend had already been in tears over how the night was turning out at this place and we weren't the only couple that was experiencing this.  I had gone through this same experience In Las Vegas but I never expected this from an establishment that I had eaten at its other restaurants never having this problem.  I believe that the staff as well as it's managers need some serious retraining on how to treat patrons of the restaurant they work in otherwise they have no place being in the Restaurant or hospitality business.

Once she was finished I expected to be seated, the phone rang again and she picked it up, I expected her to put the caller on hold and seat us but she gave priority to the caller, the call went on for minutes while we waited. At some point I tried to get her attention and was ignored, my friend who became impatient tried to get her attention by waving at her.  Finally she finished with the call and was ready to seat us and explained that because she was all by herself she couldn't not answer the phone. Her intentions were good but restaurant management needs to train the hostess to understand how to simply ask callers to hold while she attended to the people who were waiting in line. I had no problem waiting for her to finish the 1st call which also took a long time, since that call was already in progress when I got there, but the 2nd call she took was not acceptable and making us wait to finish her 2nd call was very bad customer service. \n\nThe place is beautiful with lovely views of the bay.

I remembered the old black man who is always at the bottom of the steps of McCormick & Kuleto's singin his heart out about all the passersby as they go up and down the stairs to Ghiradelli Square.  We headed that way to see what was happenin over there in the hopes I could get myself a serenade... \n\nFrom outside on the sidewalk the warm lighting of McCormick & Kuleto's lured us closer and closer.  As we started up the stairs we saw the NYE decor and all the patrons in their best attire.  Shiny short skirts on all the ladies and crisply pressed shirts on the men with their best set of cuff links they own.  It was just where we wanted to start the night off right.  \"Table for two?\"  Zak inquired.  \n\nThe hostess looked a little worried, but smiled at us and said \"Walk ins?  ok, let me see what I can do.\"  They quickly found us a nice booth just one row over fromthe windows overlooking the bay.  It was perfect!  \n\nComplimentary glass of Champagne?  Don't mind if I do!  Things were starting off better than expected with trying to get into a place on NYE at 7pm for Dinner (and it was a Saturday night).  \n\nOur server recommended the Chef's special of the night which was a Filet Mignon over a bed of fresh spinach, garlic mash potatoes, and topped with fresh Lobster.  We just had to!  How can you not hear all that and stop the drool if you don't just order it and devour!?  \n\nWe started with the Black Mussels.  They were placed in a shallow sea of Jalapeno Cilantro Butter and stirred in Linguica.  It was my first time having Mussels and let me tell ya... It's going to be VERY hard to top that.  They were amazing!  I was dipping my bread in the butter sauce there at the end.  In heaven!  So delicious!! \n\nWhen my entree came there were HUGE chunks of fresh lobster on there!  So big that as the server sat down my plate the chunks were losing their balance atop the Filet and tumbling down onto my plate.  It was a thing of pure beauty.  It would take an hour to get that much plump lobster out of the shell to enjoy.  And there is was just sitting there nestled in the mashed potatos and spinach... shining up at me... ready for the fork to enter it and bring it up to my lips.  Oh yah!  YUMMY!  \n\nI can honestly say... and I've been saying it a couple times a day since New Year's Eve... That was one of THE BEST dinners I've had in my life.  It was perfect.  \n\nThe service was divine.  Suggested entree was a hit!  Drinks?  We ALWAYS custom order our drinks wherever we go and he didn't bat a lash when we gave him the % of puree to club soda and gin we wanted for our perfectly designed NYE cocktails we were dreaming of.  \n\nI've been there before and I'll go there again.

The restaurant is rather large on the inside and well decorated. It has a pretty formal atmosphere. We made a reservation at open table, so we were immediately seated at a lovely table near the window when we arrived. A nearby table directly next to the window opened up, and our server happily moved us so we could have a better view of the water. Our server, Justin, was very knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive. We started off with bruschetta, which was delicious. Then, I had the swordfish which came with a veggie mix on the side. My husband got a steak which also came with veggies. We split a family size truffle mac and cheese. Our dinner was amazing and very fresh. We each had a glass of La Crema wine from Sonoma, which was honestly pretty much the best wine I've ever had. For dessert, we shared the upside down apple walnut pie with ice cream. OMG so good! We loved this place and will be back if we ever come to the area again.", "author": "Christina G."}

SF sourdough from Bodini Bakery you can't go wrong. The wait staff was pleasant and efficient. It was good to see my friends and enjoy their company.\n\nThe bad; I order a Cesar salad with calamari.  It was NOT a Cesar, the lettuce was romaine and shredded with fried calamari thrown in.  Even though I knew this was NOT a Cesar, I ate it anyways because for a salad it took over 1 hr and I was starving. A friend ordered the Linguini with Clams, I was told the natural clams were good but very small which (I saw and they were) and it was assumed someone threw in \"canned clams\" to compensate but it made the whole dishes to salty. Another friend had fish, but sent it back because it just was not good. All dishes are way overpriced; yes it is a tourist trap.

Nice touch.\n\nI scanned the menu and there it was \"Kurobuta pork belly\" (aka Berkshire (aka Black Pig (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurobuta))). I go weak at the knees when I see that and quickly decided on the Sea Scallops with roasted Kurobuta pork belly with a Crab Cake starter. The g/f got the Parmesan Crusted Petrale Sole with capers.\n\nThe crab cake was deliciously crabby with tasty lemon butter sauce. The main course was mixed for me. I thought the portion was small for almost $30 with 2 scallops and 2 meager pieces of pork. The first bite of scallop was SUPER SALTY; I almost spit it out. Luckily I persevered because the rest of the dish didn't share that level of seasoning. The Kurobuta pork was also a bit disappointing with one piece roasted to a crisp (aka burned) and inedible. The second piece was much better though also a bit salty.\n\nOn the flip side, my g/f's sole was very well done with a nicely tangy lemon caper sauce. Her mom also gushed over her Halibut Cheeks so by that measure the dinner was definitely a success. \n\nI think I have bad luck picking dishes. Either that or I'm a pickier eater than most.\n\nService was a bit spotty with our waiter disappearing for long stretches of time forcing us to send other servers in search of him.

We marched past the happy hour folks at the bar, down those balcony steps, and into the main dining hall. The floor-to-ceiling windows opened out to an unobstructed view of the wharf and the bay.  Calling this a fancy place would be an understatement, considering all the well-dressed and more established-looking guests sitting at the other tables.  This place is kind of swank.\n\nSo we did what any semi-uncomfortable diners would do.  We ordered a bottle of their finest wine to pair with the four different types of raw oysters.  Next, we went for the buttery and surprisingly delicious plate of escargot (my first ever!).  For the main entrees, we got the sea scallops, the recommended sea bass, and a side of asparagus.  Keep in mind that the sea scallops come with pork.  Is that right?  As if the meal wasn't decadent enough, we topped off our meal with wedges of the cheesecake and pecan pie.\n\nIn the future, I wouldn't mind skipping the entrees and going straight for the desserts.  Everything else was good, but the sweets, oh! they were unbelievable!\n\nIn the realistic future, I'd come back here for the happy hour, order the cheeseburger, and split the pie with a friend.\n\nThere you have it.

However, the service was absolutely terrible. My server (Alex), initially messed up my order  and did not include my Lobster Tail with my Filet Mignon . Once my Lobster was cooked and brought out by someone else she never bothered to apologize and never checked to see if we wanted/needed more water or cocktails. It was our intent to make a night of it so the additional cocktail could have easily meant another $60.00 in revenue towards our total bill. It appeared to me she though that her job was simply to serve the food and not \"take care\" of her guests and provide a pleasant dining experience.   We finished our meal and waited another 20 minutes at which time the server returned and asked if we wanted dessert. By this time I simply wanted to pay the bill with an 18% tip and leave (by the way I was overcharged for the \"replacement Lobster\"). On the way out, I expressed my dissatisfaction to the manager who seemed totally ambivalent to what took place.  The amazing thing is that in 2010 I came to this place for my birthday and the service was no better at that time they were known as McCormick & Schmidt. Given the the manger seemed not to care it is not surprising that his staff is lacking in their training. A word to the wise would be. San Francisco has many fine restaurants they provide exemplary service and a truly flawless dining experience.

We've had Thanksgiving dinner here several times over the years and this past Thanksgiving will be our last.  To make a long story short:  The greeting staff was overwhelmed with the amount of people checking in for their reservations.  They took names and processed the next person and weren't directing people to the bar upstairs or to wait outside which resulted in a packed lobby area.  At one point a client came by to check on their status and they had been waiting for an hour!  We were seated about 45 minutes after we checked in (we were told our wait would be the customary 15 minutes).  \n\nI ordered a seafood trio that consisted of salmon, halibut and crab cake with mashed potatoes.

But we had a $50 gift certificate to use by the end of this month, and decided make the trip in and play tourist.  After penetrating through the traffic through the Wharf, and snagging a parking spot, we checked into the restaurant, were seated in a booth facing the Aquatic Park, and a view of Alcatraz.  With the beautiful weather and the clear view of the Bay, the hassle of getting into the Wharf was a long gone memory.  Ordered a Widmar Hefeweisen and enjoyed  the view.  Would have been happy with this without dinner.\n\nHaven't been here in 12 years, and after reading some of the Yelp reviews, my expectations were guarded.  We started out with the Caesar salad and a bowl of steamed mussels in a red curry sauce.  The leaves of the salad fresh, not wilted, and the dressing coated them without being goopy.  Nice hint of anchovies and garlic, and shave Parmesan and Romano.  The mussels were excellent, especially the curry sauce.  The sauce was coconut based, with bits of garlic and fresh basil.  Didn't over power the mussels, and had a slight kick to it.  So good, I spooned up the sauce.\n\nFor entree, my wife ordered wild salmon with pesto and a corn cake.  I had halibut cheeks with risotto and caramelized pearl onions.  Good sized portions.  The salmon was very red, very firm (not dry), and very tasty.  The corn cake was light like a souffle, studded with corn.  My halibut cheeks were also very tender.  Risotto was very creamy with a slight citrusy taste to it.  Overall, my course was pretty rich, but very tasty.\n\nWe were too full for dessert, and since it was still light, we decided to walk around the Wharf to continue our date-nite without the kids.", "author": "Steve L."}

On arrival, we were greeted by a Danny Bonaduce look alike and equally obnoxious \"Hey guys, come on down\".\n\n2. The unfriendly, unhappy, unsmiling little hostess robotically led us to our table and unconvincingly told us to \"enjoy your meal\" without ever making eye contact.\n\n3. We started with some KJ Chardonnay (always a winner) and the broiled green mussels appetizer. Nice presentation but wasted on our palates.  I've eaten better mussels at a hot dog stand.\n\n4. Mama had the Atlantic salmon which was good but served with new potatoes.  Who the hell still serves new potatoes except in prisons or cheap wedding receptions at the local Motel 6?!  Slap that piece of fish on a bed of sauteed spinach with some garlic mashed underneath, period!!\n\n5. I had the Alaskan halibut which for $27.00 should melt in my mouth!!  I cook better fish than this insipid piece of Gortons styrofoam on my plate and I'm not good at cooking fish. Oh and it also came with some scalloped new potatoes, some spinach and balsamic reduction.  Who the hell told this chef to put balsamic reduction on a piece of fish?  And why the hard on with these friggin' potatoes?  \n\n6. During our meal, we had the pleasure of overhearing Danny Bonaduce's twin tell one of the staff that he was going to do an In and Out burger run.  Not a bad idea.  I'll give you $20 bucks to go fetch me a double double with fries and you can keep the change to buy yourself a new shirt without any armpit stains.\n\n7. At this point, we decided to forego any dessert or espresso and just enjoy our conversation and company instead.\n\n8. The service was the only positive about the restaurant.

Not even the service merited a pat on the back.  I'm thinking that SF is somewhat overrated about the whole food scene.

Two of us ordered the cioppino, my favorite, and my wife ordered the grilled sturgeon. \nThe food quality and quantity is certainly not as good as my previous visits.  Both bowls of cioppino were identical and included the two small back legs from a dungeness crab, and only one leg section had enough crab meat to even open up and eat.  They did provide us a large shell cracker, but there wasn't anything to use it on.  Each cioppino also contained two shrimp, one small very overcooked scallop, five mussels, and many small chunks of white fish.  The soup part was scarce and noticeably thinner and runnier than on previous occasions. Typically there is so much in the bowl that I have difficulty finishing this dish, but today I had no trouble.

The crab cakes were small, and I felt like they were cheating a little when I read that there was also shrimp in it but I was proven wrong when it came out.  It was full of fresh crab, very little shrimp, and came with a very good red pepper aioli.  The mussels were also delicious, in a thai-style red curry.  The fish was a little dry and dense on the outsides, but was much better testing on the inside.  The potatoes that came with the fish were delicious, but the green beans were undercooked.  The patty of chiotle butter was absolute amazing.  I had to try really hard not to eat the whole chunk.  Lucky for me, my sister took care of it for me!

The waterfront views are amazing, especially on a clear day - you can see alcatraz, the muni pier, the USS jeremiah and the gorgeous blue waters.  There is a private dining area downstairs with a separate entrance which is great for swanky soirees.  \n\nThis was a girls' night out and we had dinner on a Tuesday night - the place did get busy BUT probably not as bad as on weekends so I think our service levels we received may have been better than the other reviewers.  Our server Bert was on top of his game, we got a window seat with a view of the bay, and the food was deelish.  The entire staff was pretty attentive - filled water glasses, refills on bread basket, and the GM Toby even came out to say hello towards the end of our meal and offered dessert recommendations which were spot on.  \n\n For appetizers we had the calamari, the hearts of palm/strawberry/kiwi salad, and the beet salad.  I would recommend all 3.  We also tried the mac and cheese (super cheesy and rich), exotic mushroom (lots of different mushrooms sauteed together), and pesto gnocci sides - all were divine.  The clam chowder was really fresh.  Our entrees included mahi mahi crusted with macademia, sword fish and the 8 oz filet mignon (these shrink a lot so get the larger size if you are not sure).  We all liked our entrees but we had a lot of appetizers and sides, and wanted to save room for dessert SO we ate half of our entrees and  got to go boxes.  The portion size is okay - it's not really small but you may need to order a side or a dessert to get full.  The clear winner for dessert was the banana cream pie with toffee.  We also tried the coffee creme brule, and the pecan pie but the best of the desserts was the banana cream pie.  I can't wait to go back!!. \n\n It is good for a business meal or special occasion.  The appetizers averaged $8 to $12, the entrees ranged from $16 to $35, the sides ranged from $5 to $10, and the desserts were around $7.  Seafood was fresh and they had grilled options for those trying to eat healthier.  I had to spend 2 hours at the gym the next day to help burn off some of the calories but it was worth it!\n\nWith the America's cup coming up, this is definitely the place to be to get good views and great food simultaneously.  It sounds like service can be spotty so i understand why others would review it lower but we had a great experience and I hope to be equally enthusiastic when I return again.", "author": "Bebe W."}

But really what can you expect from food that's all under $5? I was probably most impressed with the $1.95 burger and garlic sweet potato fries. The spicy ahi tuna roll tasted old.

I highly do not recommend the crab cakes especially if you like the traditional method of cooking it.  There was no crunch to it, just a mushy texture in which I found hard to consume.  It was like eating a tuna fish sandwich minus the bread.  The view is nice and the waiters were pleasant.  My breaded sole was just blah as well.  We got the incorrect bill, and it took a while to straighten out and recalculate.  Worst off we left without getting our credit card back.

He heard our situation and prompted the irritated workers to finally seat us. We sat down and ordered our food and drinks kindly and immediately as we were hungry and 45 minutes behind our reservation at this point. 15 minutes go by where the waiter passed us multiple times and never brought water or bread. Realizing that we were close to spending $100 on our meal, we decided the service was no where near where we had hoped it would be. We had been saving our money from our minimum wage jobs to get dressed up and have a nice meal. What a disappointment. We left our table (an hour into this nightmare) and spoke with two men at the front desk. We expressed our frustration and disappointment when they replied \"yeah, sorry, have a great night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-16", "description": "We chose McCormick & Kuleto's for our day-after Valentine's Day dinner because my partner's company threw a dinner party there and gave each employee $20 gift card. After reading prior reviews on Yelp with 3 1/2 stars from nearly 350 reviews, I had my reservations intact.\n\nWe originally had a 745pm reservation made on Opentable.com and when we arrived 30 min. earlier than scheduled, they seated us promptly (+1 point). Only problem was that, our seats wasn't facing (or even near) the window seats with the views that were raved about in the Yelp reviews. We were placed in a table that FACED diners with views of the SF Bay, literally. Instead of being seated across from each other, we were given a rectangular table with a bench on one side as the only option, forcing us to side BESIDE each other (-1 point), while watching the people with the view eat. Awkward.\n\nAfter reviewing the menu and placing our appetizer orders, I went to the restroom and on my way back, I had spotted a couple having finished with dinner and ask a passing waiter if we can take that spot. He gave me the reassuring wink and said for me to \"wait a few minutes while if it's available\". Even before I made my way back to my original bench/chair, I saw a new couple being seated at the recently vacant table. I was just starting to accept our seat arrangements, when the couple from the table across from us stood and left. Now I knew that I had to make my move. The waiter remembered and had us promptly moved into the table with chairs on opposite ends. (+1). (score is even)\n\nWe started with the appetizers: steamed manila clams and dungeness crab cake. The clams were seasoned just right but we found the crab cakes to be swimming in too much oil (they say it was the lemon butter sauce) that drowned out the flavor (-1). The crispy parsnips in the crab cakes added texture, as well. \n\nFor the main meal, I had the Sacramento Delta Sturgeon and my dinner partner had the Macadamia Nut Crusted Mahi Mahi. I found the Sturgeon to be meatier (a bit tough) than what I had expected; texture reminded me of an old tire. (-1). I enjoyed the fact that the sturgeon was bacon crusted and the ghnocchi that came with my meal was soft and delightful, as well as the sugar snap peas being cooked perfectly al dente. I had only a small taste of the mahi mahi, but I remembered the combination of guava and manga sauces and how it complimented the fish. (+1)\n\nSince we had eaten like kings with two appetizers and entree plates the size of medium pizza pans, we opted out of dessert. For an upscale restaurant with picturesque views, the price was expected: bill came to $100 (w/tax and tip incl). Considering that all four appetizer and entree dishes consisted of seafood, it was a fair price (+1).\n\nFinal tally: +1. Not likely to come back here any time soon.\n\nSuggestions:\n\nI'd like to see less butter sauce used in the crab cakes and the sturgeon could have been softer in texture and instead of tasting as fishy as the hold of a derelict tuna boat.\n\nFix the awkward seating arrangements. Diners do not want to sit beside each, but rather across from each other.", "author": "Carloalexi M."}

I'm only going to comment on the happy hour which might be one of the cheapest in the city. $2 and $3 appetizers and $3-$5 dollar drinks are great. Plus you can't beat the view. The restaurant is basically right near the water and has a nice view of the Bay, the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin. \n\nSo what brings it down your ask? To be honest I'm not sure. Maybe its just that the place is so nice, you expect things, i.e. the food, to be better and they aren't. Maybe because its next to Ghridella Square, the place feels like a high class tourist trap or a glorified Olive Garden.

Our reservations were for 3:45 p.m.  It normally takes an hour to get to SF from our home in the east bay.  That particular day, the bay bridge was a mess and it took us two additional hours. We called the restaurant at 3:40 and spoke with a woman that said not to worry, they'd been getting many calls from people stuck on the bridge. They moved our reservation to 4:15. They said if we were going to be later than that, to give them a call.  We called again at 4:10 and told them we were close but we're at least 30 minutes away.  They said no problem, and to just come in.  We got there at 4:50.  A man up front said he'd given our table away and could not hold it.  My husband was ready to leave but I said absolutely not and asked for the manager.  I told the manager that we had called three times and twice they told us not to worry and reset the time and then the last time just said to come in. I said I would understand had we been told that one of the times we called but they never said that until we got there.  The manager said he'd seat us and to wait 20 min.  We were seated within 10 minutes at a table right by the window with a beautiful view.  We had to wait 40 minutes before someone took our order and we had to find a server. A server told us that our server had not shown up for work yet and they'd have to find us a server.  My advice, don't go on any day of celebration or holiday.

Four years ago, my boyfriend and I had our first date here, and several more after.  Three years ago, when we had to move back to the east coast, we had dinner here for our last night in San Francisco.  Two years ago, we had after-dinner desserts here on our first visit back to the city, and upon leaving we walked right out to the bay and what-do-you-know, he popped the question.  Right there in front of the restaurant.  So of course, it makes sense that when we went back to SF for our anniversary, our last stop would be here.\n\nWould you believe it, but they remembered us?  I honestly don't know how or what kind of magic records they keep, but the host sat us at our favorite \"first date\" table and he mentioned seating us there almost FOUR YEARS AGO.  Amazing.  My mouth hung open for a full three-five minutes. The menu, which they change and print each day, had \"Happy 1st Anniversary\" across the top since I mentioned it when making the reservation.   Our waiter sent us an amazing dessert on the house to celebrate.  The staff went way beyond good customer service, and we were so touched and impressed by how special they made us feel.\n\nNow, onto the review.  Service was great the entire night - our water glasses were always full, the food came out quickly, and our waiter had great recommendations for food and wine. I tried the halibut special and my husband tried the scallops special.   Since the menu changes so frequently, I'm not going to go into details about the dishes, but the food was pretty darn good.  Not A+ but a solid B.  For dessert we tried the chocolate box, which has been on the menu forever and is totally delicious.  \n\nThe views were awesome as always.  I can't think of another restaurant in the city that offers such fabulous panoramic views of the bay.  Despite the proximity to Fisherman's Wharf, the decor inside is upscale and there's absolutely no hint of \"tourist district\" anywhere.  Not a cheesy ship's wheel or 3-D crab in sight.  Very tasteful.\n\nAll in all, this is a special restaurant and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice night out in the city for any occasion.

We specifically told the server that our meat needed to be medium well and again we had to return our food because it was undercooked. When I am paying 30.00 plus dollars for a entr\u00e9e I expect it to be perfect the first time not recooked. Our server could care less. Our water glasses were empty a majority of our dinner, and our server was no where to be found. We had two terrible experiences and are done trying.

We dined here on a Saturday evening in 3/2007.  We sat in the main dining room area in a booth that faced directly to the water. The main dining room is adjacent to the Bay View room.  The view was spectacular.  The service was quick, efficient, but almost factory like. Maybe it's because we were facing the water and the walkway, we saw servers constantly speeding by.\n\nThe food was good.  It wasn't mouthwatering memorable.  We ordered popcorn shrimp.  The shrimp tasted a bit under cooked and without the dipping sauce, it didn't have much flavor .  I ordered a grilled sea bass with ginger and cilantro sauce.  The fish was moist and flavorful.  I think for the price, I expected a little more fish. I already knew this would be the case reading other reviews, but wanted to check it out for ourselves.  The triple berry dessert was a bit bitter and tart.  The crust consistency was like an expired frozen pie crust.\n\nLooking only at the space as a possible wedding venue, we probably will pass.  We were thinking of renting out the Captain Room.  The Captain room is at the end, passing the main dining room and the Bay View Room. It's a good size room, but if you are only renting out the Captain room, you'll have to walk through the Bay View room to get to the restroom.  The restroom is located downstairs.  The space would work if we rented out both the Captain and Bay View room, but we didn't need that much space.  The Captain room does not have a separate outdoor entrance, so you'll have to walk through the main dining room to get to the room.  The Bay View room's view is beautiful. There are windows along one entire side. The Captain Room's view of the water is more limited.\n\nOther stuff, it's a kid-friendly place. We saw lots of kids and parents with strollers.", "author": "traveler Y."}

Business was very slow and we waited nearly ten minutes to be seated. The first woman approached us only to answer the phone to take a possible reservation while numerous staff were mingling, having ignored the phone while drinking cocktails around the bar. A second woman, eventually, approached and acted as though we weren't patrons and said, \"Do you need something?\". Uh, yeah, we're waiting to be seated. First red flag! I was already close to leaving because of that behavior but opted to give them another chance. We were seated, though the woman, instead of inquiring which seats we would like, pulled a chair out, expectantly and gruffly agreed when my wife chose a different seat. Once we stated that we  were SF natives and weren't concerned about the view so much, her attitude changed a bit. Second red flag. The server arrived, pleasantly enough, took our order and came back with additional utensils for the crab, missing a spoon with crusty gunk on it and failed to ever come by to inquire about the food and drink. Third red flag. At $55 per plate, we were, understandably, expecting quality fare, however, the filet mignon and lobster were over-done (medium rare is NOT medium well and your lobster should not be something you hit with a racket). The side dishes were under-seasoned and oily, the macaroni a step up from Kraft, the mushrooms old and over cooked, the king crab legs warm, the plating ramshackle. While we waited for the server to come by , we asked someone else instead who got her attention. As I waited for my second martini, we overheard the bartender drop the shaker and my wife went up to the bar to retrieve my second drink and unlike the first, had bottom shelf gin (A Gilbey's bottle beside it) and no olives (are they trying to get over on people by serving a decent cocktail followed by crap?). Numerous staff were mingling and throwing back alcohol - clearly their intent was not to be attentive to their patrons but to their own little party. $200 later we left unhappy and regretted that we could have gone to Safeway and made a better meal for less because the cooks clearly no longer take pride in their food and are accustomed to providing mediocre touristy fare to people enticed by a nice view and white linens. So much for attempting to have a nice meal in memorium.

We arrived 15 minutes early at 8:00. only to be told right off the bat that \"we are running 15 minutes late so it will be 8:30\". They suggest we wait in the bar with a promise they WILL find us. Sit in bar. Waitress comes to our table, removes pervious patrons glasses, doesn't wipe table. Asks what we want. We ask for a beer and wine menu. Wait several minutes for that. Finally at 8:15 she takes our drink order. Drinks (2 beers) arrive after 15 minutes as other patrons order directly from bar while we wait and wait. Never supplied an appetizer menu. Waitress delivers the wrong beer. Hostess dude comes thru bar looking for folks at 8:30, we inquire about our table. Promised just a few minutes. Ask again at 8:45. Just a \"few more minutes\". Cocktail hostess is long gone by the way. She doesn't seem to interested in helping us. We give up on getting a second round from our bar table and order directly from bartender, where I get the correct beer this time. At 9:00 I ask AGAIN when will be seated for our 8:15 reservation and get told the table will be \"ready in a moment\". Finish second beer. We notice the restaurant is thinning out, the bar is getting empty, folks arriving after us have long ago been seated. At 9:15, and hour after our 8:15 reservation and an hour and fifteen after arriving we are told that our table HAD been ready but they couldn't find us in the bar! WTF?! At this point we are so disappointed and exacerbated by the lousy service that the thought of paying $55.00 per item ala carte, plus probably $50.00 on \"side dishes\" for each of us, that it was best to \"bail\" and stop the bleeding. At least I woke up this morning without having spent $250 dollars at a lousy restaurant. From what I see of the food reviews here, we were smart.

After waiting 10 minutes a gentleman approached us stating abruptly \"Are you the party of 4?\". He then proceeded to take us to a booth which was situated across from the tables with a view- we would've been OK with this booth however it was extremely small in size I mean for example I felt cramped and claustrophobic when seated and I am 5 ft and  105 pounds and the rest of my party was extremely uncomfortable. about 10 to 15 minutes later they finally offered to move us to a back room with a view table we were excited and pleased with the view however this room was extremely cold as if they had air-conditioning on and no heat at all! at this point we were happy to be at a comfortable table and we just wanted to eat. at first Our waiter seemed friendly and accommodating but that didn't last. he focused on the large parties around us 2 of which ordered after us but got their food first. after waiting 45 minutes for our food we clearly became irritated. he never came over to apologize or to make sure we were okay. when the food was finally served by a different waiter who was much nicer, it was delicious. for such a beautiful establishment we expected more from the staff they need better training and skills to provide friendly warm service. for the prices of this place you're better off spending your money somewhere else where you'll get better service.", "author": "Emily D."}

It was a pretty nice restaurant, and I'm glad that my company picked up the tab!  This is one of those San Francisco classic surf and turf restaurants, but they focus a little more on the surf portion, being that they are located in Ghiradelli Square, right off the water.\n\nThe cocktails are great here, as many other reviewers have noted.  I had the Caipirinha, which I'm still not able to pronounce, but it was great.  Lots of fresh lime.  I'd love to come here again, if just for the cocktails.\n\nThe menu has lots of oysters, which is great if you love them, but if you're like me and don't go out of your way to order them, you'll be a little overwhelmed.  And the best oysters they had, came from Washington state, which was ironic as thats where I was traveling from for this business trip.\n\nSticking true to my Pacific North West home, I had the Smoked Salmon which was excellent.  It was nicely smoked, not too over powering but just the right amount to taste it over the greens, but I was jealous my co-worker's scallops with pork cheeks.\n\nThe lobster bisque looked great too.  It was a production to have it served: tableside, over a pile of crab in a soup plate, a dish of bisque was poured and it was just beautiful.  I've really got to remember to order bisque more often.\n\nOur server was great with wine recommendation; she nailed my co-workers request for a smooth but full red wine.  She (and a few others) really took care of our group of 13 people, water glasses were never empty, the  food came as close together as you can for 13 diners.  We were offered a appetizer sampler (off menu) that was right-sized for our group, but had a few more raw fish items that the people from Wisconsin dared.\n\nBusiness dinner or dinner date, this is an alright place to go in the City.", "author": "Beau R."}

How I found parking right off Ghiradelli Square and how we arrived on time is a small holiday miracle. And admittedly my review is biased by having a great time with friends, overlooking the entire SF Bay on a bright clear sunny day and having a $50 gift card. Nonetheless, we all found the food delicious. Yes the service was initially slow, they were quite crowded, but our server was friendly and attentive. I couldn't decide what to order but ended up going for a traditional Cioppino. The seafood stew was full of fish, calamari, scallops and a dungeness crab claw, and the broth was wonderfully garlicky and tomatoey (is that a word?). hearty sourdough bread was a valuable addition dipped in the stew of course. Yummy.  My partner, a very picky eater, thoroughly enjoyed the shrimp scampi, and my other friends scarfed down the scallops. one small miss: the fried calamari isn't worth it. I'll go here again one day, the entire package is appealing and attractive and the food is very good. (Note to self: don't accurately describe what calamari tentacles are to my partner ever again.

When it arrived it was hardley even warm and the batter was semi mushy.  (Calamari) it took another 30 minutes to get the other, which was a simple bowl of soup ( it was hot ) The food finally came another 30 minutes after that only to be luke warm to cold when it did arrive!   I don't pay nearly $40 a person to wait so long and to have cold food served to me!  We sent back the food and were brought new plates. (Both orders were cold). When they did bring new plates the sides were still served cold!  The last time I ate here we had the same issues with cold food and loooong waits for food!  This was NOT a good experience.  The food tasted like mass produced \"gourmet\" seafood.  It was just average and way over priced for what we experienced.  I wasn't asking for a discount on my meal but one was never offerd even though we were patient and polite.  In most upper scale establishments, this would be common practice.

My wife and one of the others in my party that ordered the Tuna Melts were not happy with the taste or quality of their meals; the tuna was not an Ahi Tuna steak but was chopped and mixed with onions; plus the Gruyere cheese used was not paired appropriately with this dish....strike two.  My daughter's Chicken salad was okay, although she mentioned that the chicken did not taste consistent, some was cold and rubbery and some was warm.  The worse surprise was the Scallop dish...picture six very small scallops served on a bed of wilted leaves on top of orange slop.  The serving dish was roughly 6\" x 12\", and these poor quality scallops were presented in this manner.  I struggled to finish the scallops, and completely disregarded the rest.

It's cooking 101 that you serve soup last because of the skin problem.\n\nThe ahi tuna was middling at best and the price was far too high. Charging $30 for a 6oz steak takes shameless profiteering to new levels.\n\nAdd in that the bar closed at 11pm , although we could still buy wine by the bottle and you had a very unsatisfactory experience. The extra star comes for the view, which is great, but I'd have liked to have given this place 1 1/2 stars.", "author": "Iain T."}

But hey - this place deserves better notices than some of the comments that have been posted. We got  a great table next to a window with a fabulous view of San Francisco Bay. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and eager to please. My sister-in-law wanted crab. It was fresh and in season. She was a little hesitant, never having tackled a whole crab before. The server provided an encouraging nudge. She went for it and loved it. \n\nLotsa choices on the menu - everything from fresh, plainly grilled fish to creative combinations. I had monkfish stuffed with chorizo served on a root vegetable hash. It was great. My wife had a tough time deciding. Last time we ate here, she had salmon stuffed with crab, shrimp, and brie cheese. She liked it so much that she considered ordering it again. Instead, she tried halibut with crab shrimp mousse served with leeks and huckleberry sauce. Much to her dismay, she liked that so well that she doesn't know which to order next time we're there.\n\nWas it pricey? Yes. But we all felt it was a good value for the money.\n\nSo, let's see.

We had to wait in the bar for 15 minutes until the white dirty blond hair female hostess brought us over to what she considered a table for 4.. The table was a temporary table with 4 folding chairs next to the swinging doors of the kitchen. I mean my head would be approx. 4 feet away. I asked her if we could move over to a regular table near the window away from the active kitchen doors. She said the regular tables were already taken although we didn't see anyone there. Then we looked at the worst seats in the place and decided not to even sit down there.\n\n As we started to move away to leave the place, the headwaiter came over and asked what was wrong. We told him and he agreed. He then went over to a much better table and began to clear off the table for us. While we were standing away from the table waiting for him to clear it, the female hostess came over to my wife and I and said \" Hey that was the only table available, why did you complain!\" My wife said that since we had reservations and such that we should not have to seat at a lousy table with folding seats next to a active kitchen doorway with no view. The hostess then became angry and started yelling at us and said that everyone has reservations and that we would have to take the lousy table with its poor location! \n\nThat was enough and I told my friends that we would leave since we were now afraid of not only bad service but that something might happen to our food. The head waiter came over and said he was sorry and that she was new. He offered us a bottle of champagne, but for us it was too late. We went across the street and had a nice dinner there.", "author": "Jim C."}

Each time, I received exceptional service whether it was my $50 dinner per person or my free brunch tasting event through Yelp. \n\nFood: Folks come here for the seafood and you really can't go wrong from eating their seafood. I had their salmon before for dinner and it was excellent. I've had some great crab cake here too. During the brunch, I really enjoyed the mandarin orange crepes and the apple cheese turnover. Consistently, the ingredients are quite fresh and I like how things weren't too sweet. I must say, however, the devil eggs I had this past weekend were a bit too salty. I also feel that portions are sizable for the type of restaurant and cuisine.\n\nService: I've always had great service here. Friendly staff who are attentive and care. It fits the experience.\n\nAmbiance: This place has a more graceful, classy feel to it not to mention great panoramic views. I never feel rushed here which is one of the reasons that people pay a bit more to eat at a nice sit down restaurant.\n\nParking: I've never had trouble finding metered parking around this place. It's near Pier 39, but closer to Aquatic Park and in a section with slightly more street parking. Meters run 3 dollars per hour. There's also several parking garages nearby.\n\nTip: If you need Internet, there's free Internet at Ghiradelli Square.

Have to say waiter (Mike) is only reason we had a pleasant experience.  It was obvious he went out of his way to make up for the rude behavior of Mario (the maitre d').  When we arrived we approached Ricardo for a very late dinner midweek.  There were obviously tables open by the large windows and we asked if we could be seated at one of them.  Mario was on the phone at the time looking very important.  Ricardo began to show us to our table, when Mario hurried over and moved us to another table towards the back.  He claimed there were others who had reserved the table we had originally wanted.  He was short in communication and rude, turned on his heel and left.  Mike swooped in and made the dinner memorable from then on, even though we had to deal with noise and interruption from a party in the adjoining room, a view less than stellar looking at buildings and not the Golden Gate Bridge, and an incredible 45 minute gap between bread being served and dinner arriving due to the \"kitchen backup with the large party seated nearby\", and the private party in the enclosed room.

We did an online reservation and they we glad to seat us next to a view of the ocean. it was really beautiful. They also personalized their menu (printed new ones) that actually said Happy Birthday with my sister's name. What kind of restaurant ever does that?!?!\n\nAnyway, the food was enjoyable. Of course everything was super fresh because everything came right from the ocean. I'm not a big fan of seafood, so the review is bias. My family seemed to enjoy everything though. This rating is mainly based on service. They were absolutely spectacular. As we ordered, they didn't even write down our orders; waiters go all on memory. \n\nThey answered our questions very well. Which fish were meatier, flaky, light and so on. They made sure we ordered exactly what we wanted. I give the service a great big PLUS. \n\nBut if you're looking for a good seafood restaurant, I would go to one on a pier. This place is quite overpriced for the fancy atmosphere and great view.

Unfortunately, today I decided to try this location for happy hour and I was disappointed.\n\nHave you ever waited so long for service only to be told what you decided on was out? But..you don't want to say you need a few more minutes, because you know it'll be HOURS before anyone gets back to you.  So I quickly decided on the clams and a bloody mary off the happy hour menu and waited to see the portion on the clams before I got anything else. \n\nMeanwhile, I waited...and waited...and finally 25 minutes later my tiny cup of tiny clams arrived with very little fanfare from me. Keep in mind that I ordered the same thing before at Jake's (the McCormick & Shmicks in Portland) for the same price, but the quality and quantity were both a LOT better there. Do I even need to mention that the bartender needed to tell his food runner twice that his order was incomplete for the customers sitting next to me? Somehow I got that funny feeling that I'm not the only one who was disappointed here..neither the customers nor the workers here seemed especially happy.\n\nBeing charged $12 for a tasteless bloody mary during happy hour was also mildly annoying, especially when my first two drink choices were out. How about calling it UNhappy hour instead?\n\nOn a high note there is a beautiful view of the bay from here if you sit in the dining room, but almost every rinky dink tourist trap restaurant on the wharf does too.", "author": "Natalie M."}

While I have always enjoyed them, lately the food seems average at best. Saturday was a special occasion as it was my kids' first time in San Francisco. My wife and I wanted them to experience great food and a beautiful view. We loved McCormick & Kuletos years ago and figured they would too. The disappointment started as we walked in the door. Despite adding a note to my Open Table reservation that said it was a special family occasion and requesting a table along the window, the host acted like A) he didn't have this info and B) it was annoying him. During dinner, the service was absent. My wife's water glass and my son's Coke glass were empty for 20 minutes, we were never offered bread and no one stopped by to see if we needed anything. And that was after my wife said she was going to order a glass of wine after she had an extra minute to look at the wine list. Once we did order, I was disappointed with the food quality. I ordered a \"Jumbo Prawn Cocktail\" for $16. It was 4 shrimp that had been butterflied and were a little tough from being over cooked. They were very small shrimp - about 2\" long from tail to the end of the meat. In fact my daughter had better shrimp in her scampi dinner order. The meal was ok overall from a taste standpoint. And the view is magnificent. But I am done with the entire chain of M&S restaurants. Too expensive for average food, terrible service and a cold reception at the front door. How could this chain miss what made them originally successful?", "author": "Todd L."}

We had a reservation for 5:45 and when we arrived it was packed, tons of increasingly antsy/pushy people in the front. We were told that the wait would \"only be a few minutes\", but it turned out to be a good 30 minutes or so. At first I thought the majority of the crowd were people without reservations, but I quickly realized that the restaurant obviously overbooked (my family and I waited over near the bar and I could look down see the computer monitor, there were tons of reservations for a very small timeslot). After about 15 minutes, a waitress started handing out free champagne to people who were waiting. \n\nWe finally got seated around 6:15, luckily, in an area far from the front of the restaurant. Our waiter disappeared for a long time after we ordered our drinks. My mom really wanted crab, but they were all out, which sucked (she was looking forward to having crab since before she even arrived in town). You'd think they'd have more crab for the holiday weekend, but whatevs. We got free clam chowder while we waited since the kitchen was backed up, and our food came out around 7. I had grilled salmon with lemon butter, it was nice and fresh. The food was good, but I don't think it was worth the wait. I guess one good thing about waiting so long was that I was definitely hungry by the time we got our food. I've come here once or twice in the past, and from what I remember, the food was good, but not mind blowingly amazing.  \n\n3 stars for the food\n-1 for being hella overbooked and slow", "author": "Paige C."}

I guess all restaurants need to have their signature Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer, but this one met and exceeded my expectations. \n(+) All the tables are pretty good ones, as the restaurant has 'layered' tables that are like 'stadium seating'. \n(+) We were seated promptly and didn't have to wait for our 7:30pm reservation. \n\n(-) Waiter was really weird. Totally not conversational/friendly, somewhat of a Waiter-bot. You'd expect better from this place, right? \n(-) PARKING! What the....??? For $40-50/pp not including beverages, you'd think they'd validate for more than one hour in the garage. I wasn't in the mood to drive around and look for street parking and the parking that evening came out to $14! On the drive there, I called them and asked, they said they *did* have parking in the garage, but the hostess failed to tell me VALIDATION WAS FOR ONLY ONE HOUR. \n(-) The Ono was \"OK\"... not as \"Ono\" as I had expected... also, when we asked for a substitution on the rice (b/c we had to, my dad had chipped a tooth and was told 'no rice'  for the next 60 days) the waiter was all, \"Well, we only have asparagus and carrots!\". OK, that's FINE.. sigh... \n\nOverall, an experience you kind of 'have to do' with the parentals/in laws/ grandparentals / OR outta towners.... but for a romantic or impressive date for locals?

There's nothing wrong with walking around Ghirardelli Square or pointing at trinkets displays on Pier 39.  Sure, it's nice when your in-laws from Idaho act as a buffer between your hip, urbane self and your touristy, I LOVE SF - sweatshirt wearing alter-ego . . . but what if they are not in town?\n\nWhen my friend suggested dinner at McCormick & Kuleto's, I was a bit surprised.  I haven't been there in years, and I rarely think \"Ghirardelli Square\" when I think about dinner.  I am really glad he suggested the place, though.\n\nWe showed up at 7:30 pm last Friday, and Ghirardelli Square was almost deserted.  I bet the tourists decided not to freeze their butts off and stay in.  We found parking right on Jefferson Street and walked right in.  The hardest part was trying to get to the hostess without \"accidentally\" trampling over confused tourists.\n\nAs we were walking to our table, I realized how HUGE this place was.  Big floor to ceiling windows, tiered seating, gold banisters and massive pillars made it look even bigger.  Our booth was not by the window, but the view was still amazing.  I could see why the tourists love it so much!\n\nWe started with a Kona Kampachi sashimi appetizer.  It was my favorite part of the entire meal: thinly sliced Kona Kampachi fish, served with slices of avocado with wasabi and soy sauce.  The fish was delicious and flavorful.  For $11.95 for 4 slices, it'd better have been!\n\nThen I ordered the lettuce wedge salad with blue cheese dressing.  The salad wasn't very exciting, but it was definitely up to par.  For my entree, I ordered one of their daily specials, Alaskan halibut cheeks (hee hee - butt cheeks!).  The halibut cheeks were delicious.  They are sweeter, chewier and stringier than your average halibut steak, which made this fish dish quite exciting.  They were served on a bed of risotto, which complemented the Alaskan delicacy perfectly.  At $32.95, I think the word \"delicacy\" is not a misnomer. \n\nI'd like to point out that my friend's experience wasn't as smooth as mine, although, truth be told, both of his problems were citrus related.  First, his $11 lemon drop aperitif was not as strong as he had hoped.  Then, during the meal, it took him awhile to flag down the waitress to ask for a couple of slices of lemon to complement his grilled salmon.  \"When life gives you lemons, make lemonade\" seems appropriate here, I suppose.  \n\nWe had a wonderful time, and I definitely see myself coming back here when I am in the mood for some fish.

The Dungeness Crab Cake appetizer is pretty good. I really liked the crispy parsnip chips they topped it off with. I wasn't thrilled by the entrees, but they were decent. I had the Pacific Snapper with the Lime Ginger Sauce. Unfortunately, it was served to me barely warm and the fish was pretty dry. The Petrale Sole is slightly better and definitely has more flavor. The Macaroni, Gruyere, Truffle side is creamy and delicious so I recommend that. As far as desserts we tried the Banana Toffee Cream Pie and the Ghirardelli Chocolate Ganache Tart. Both were very good. The Cream Pie is much lighter than the tart. The tart is DELICIOUS if you love chocolate, but is very, very dense so for some people they may only be able to handle eating part of it.", "author": "Kathy A."}

The fish was fresh:  we had scallops and swordfish, and they were cooked well.  The beets on the beet salad also were done well.  But there was absolutely no love, or no soul, in the cooking.

The dungeness crab pasta was excellent, with plenty of crab, but you have to look for it, sometimes hidden under the pasta. Raw oysters, Kumamoto oysters from Humboldt were EXCELLENT (but small.) They were very good about letting you sample taste a few wines before deciding on a glass. Service was a little slow during the peak, but friendly. Watch out, a cappucino or coffee comes from the bar and undergoes liquor tax, as well as the SF city health tax of 3.5%... it does add up.

It wasn't as rich and complex as I had hoped.  And the toasted bread was way too oily. \n\nIt's hard to say if this is a restaurant to take visitors to.

Phew that was a relief. \n\nBF's brother made reservations for 5 so there wasn't a wait. We quickly got seated by the nice host and then got our drinks on! I had the Peach lemonade cocktail. Not bad...not bad at all! BF and his family had wine (I'm not really fond of wine) but it's okay because I got my cocktail! \n\nWe had the deep fried calamari with three different sauces. O-M-G so good!!! 2 exclamation marks because i was hungry but still very very good. Took a bite of the calamari and it felt perfect in my mouth. Crunchy an hot on the outside and fresh in the inside. Yum-o\n\n I ordered the mix grill ($24.95), it came with halibut, crab cake, salmon, veggies, and mashed potatoes. Really worth it even though I didn't pay. Thanks Wesley! The mashed potatoes were reallllllly good. Probably the best mashed potatoes I've had. The salmon came with some kind of berry sauce which I didn't really like much but everything else was really. I was inhaling my food because it was so good! \n\nNow why are you thinking I'm giving them 4 stars since I'm going on and on about how good their food was? Well let me tell you, it was the RESTROOM! Sorry people I do judge a restaurant by their restrooms, it's still a part of the whole experience. How may I put this. The restroom seemed like the type that you can find in a hole-in-a-wall restaurant. Water all over the floor, dim, mirror looked like it could've been in a horror movie, and it had a funny smell. Grossssss\n\nWell back to the FOOD, we decided to order dessert since it was BF's Mom's birthday so we ordered two kinds of dessert, a fruit cobbler with vanilla ice cream on top, and a chocolate cake with ice cream on the side. The cobbler was a little sweet for me but the chocolate cake was good. It wasn't dry at all and they even made a little cute decoration on the plate with a shadow of a fork made with cocoa powder. Overall a very good experience. Oh and did I mention that we were seated by the window? We were facing the beach and the sunset, even though the boyfriend and i wasn't on a date it was still really romantic.", "author": "Tracy A."}

They don't have an enormous amount of drink specials but if you're gorging yourself with their cheap and good food, it's fine. \n\nFrom 3p - 6pm, their happy hour has... for $2.95 each, you can get... a half pound burger, hummus w/ pita bread, chicken sliders. \n\nI have noticed that they staff 3 bartenders but only 1 server during these hours.

Some of the ten were out-of-towners looking for a real San Francisco experience.  We wound up selecting McCormick and Kuleto's over several other view restaurant options which appeared just too pricey, particularly because we had four kids with us.  We were very pleased with our choice.  The restaurant is a large, impressive, nice place, with gigantic windows looking out to the bay.\n\nI had baby greens with crumbled blue cheese an glazed walnuts, followed by Grilled Prawns and olive tapenade on crostinis.  Both were very delicious.  Others in the group had clam chowder, chowder in a bread bowl, lobster bisque and various salads.  None were disappointed.  \n\nFor just over $20 per person, we left feeling like we had indulged in a real San Francisco gem.  Adding to this was the fact that Ghirardelli Square was just outside the door.  We will definitely go back!", "author": "Holly N."}

Happening place with an amazing view.\"  From there it was pretty much a fast slide in to oblivion.\n\nParty of four, we were waiting at the Host Stand for at least five minutes before being acknowledged.  (We were the only ones there, dude was behind the counter on the phone)  After he told us just a minute (five), another employee came up to him and started complaining about another employee.  They had it out, and then we got our table.\n\nI have condensed that story to a great degree......\n\nWe sit, are presented menus, and it takes approximately ten minutes for our waiter to even REALIZE that we are there.  He was bouncing around the restaurant as if he was trying to re-create a Jackson Pollack painting with an air guitar but miraculously manages to avoid us (maybe I AM anti-matter...)  Never get his name, only a flippant attitude, and actually for the first time in my life manage to consume my entire appetizer with my menu in my lap BEFORE they take our dinner order.\n\nRedacting much more of the future story, my two favorite parts now in hindsight are 1. My Sashimi:  As fresh as the day it was caught in 1954.  2.  The power went out and the staff ran around taking cues from our waiter on how to imitate Jackson Pollack paintings.\n\nTwo other truly shocking aspects of the entire affair and I take this from a safety and service standpoint:  during the power failure the manager was seen once on his cell phone stomping through the restaurant---after that he stood in the bar.  Second, when I asked the waiter about receiving a bill with the power out he laughed at me.  (Menu, paper, pen, calculator?) Oh no, must...have...computer...HAHA!  Here's your tip.\n\nThe over all rudeness, poor quality, and lack of customer service makes me wonder how this place stays in business.  Seeing how the staff conducted themselves in a unique situation with the power out blew me away.  It was no big deal, but they literally vanished and managed to provide even LESS service when they had lighting.\n\nDine at your own risk......take your business some place else.", "author": "Chris V."}

They really step their game up for this day. Sure the prices skyrocket for the holiday, but boy does the food make up for the price.

It was a good balance of sweet, creamy, and caramel drizzled bananas.\n\nService: EXCELLENT. The host, busser, and server. Our server was very professional, gave good recommendations, friendly, answered all our questions, checked on us after each dish arrived, and made the fresh squeezed lemonade sweeter since it was a bit too tart for us.\n\nAtmosphere: It has a nice view of Aquatic Park, especially with the tiered seating, so everyone gets a view and not just the people sitting by the window.

It was cold when it got to our table and I finished it in less than 10 minutes, even though I took my time.  Yup, that's how small it was.  Oh yeah, and the side of my plate looked like they hadn't cleaned it.  It had dried up smears of clam chowder or something.\n\nSeafood Alfredo Pasta ($22): First off, the scallops were NASTY.  They were weird, small, bitter things.  They tasted like brussel sprouts!  And  the shrimp looked like they came out from someone's Shrimp Louie.  They were tiny, and smelled like they were old.  \n\nOverall, the food was way below average and we expected more from them.  The Kuleto's in Burlingame is classier and food tastes way better!!

Why did I have a great time, then?  Because the view (especially at sunset), the happy energy of the touristy crowd, and the theater-like terraced layout of the restaurant make for a festive atmosphere.  I never go here without an out-of-town visitor and they never fail to be impressed, so it's worth it for me.  The food isn't a detractor, it just isn't a draw.  It's not a great value, but once you factor in everything else, I keep going back.  Plus, you can always go get a wonderful chocolate milkshake at Ghirardelli's afterwards if dinner wasn't satisfying.  \n\nThere are some nice touches: the french bread is very fresh.  The butter is sweet and creamy.  There are flowers on or near the tables.  The menu is totally cool: today's huge fresh fish selection from all over the world can be prepared any way that you can see dishes listed on the menu. \n\nThere is one weird thing: the bathrooms are down two flights of stairs.  For some reason, the men's room is always full of loitering preteen boys.  Maybe they're bored with their families and don't have anywhere else to play?\n\nDefinitely a cut above the other fisherman's wharf eateries.", "author": "Eric N."}

This restaurant even made this pretentious show of giving me disposable wooden chopsticks... JUST FOR THE AHI!  Ooh, be still my beating Asian heart!\n\nAnd on top of that, the ahi wasn't especially fresh, certainly nowhere near as fresh as it would have been in any good Japanese restaurant in SF, and it was twice the price.\n\nYou could say: \"It's your fault ordering raw fish in an American restaurant,\" but I disagree.  If this place is going to tout itself as a high-end seafood restaurant, the least they could do is use the freshest fish.  That and offer other seafood dishes besides seared ahi that aren't completely drowning in butter/cream/cheese.\n\nWhat an overpriced tourist trap.", "author": "James L."}

Despite being local food snobs, we happily enjoyed eating at McCormick & Kuleto's beautiful Ghirardelli Square restaurant on Fisherman's Wharf.\n\nI thought our family would enjoy the location for Mother's Day dinner this past month, and man were we wrong. We will never return to our former favorite haunt. Horrible service (for starters, 1 hour after ordering our appetizer, our calamari & $15-for-4-prawn-cocktail finally showed up -- and they hadn't even asked us if they could take our order yet! Asking where our soup was... begging for a 2nd glass of sparkling wine 3x to take me out of my misery... it goes on.) This with a table of 10, including 2 teens & 2 kids, not a romantic/leave-us-alone-to-linger dinner.

The servers were friendly and attentive considering the chaos of servicing a large wedding. They started with appetizers and drinks before dinner, and I particularly appreciated the servers who came out to the patio to serve us yummy tender sesame covered chicken strips, tasty filo dough baked brie, and flavorful bruschetta. \n\nWhen we got into the dining room it was nicely setup, albeit the tables were packed with all the flatware, silverware, and glasses. The service was prompt as they ensured we had drinks and correct dishes. The food came out pretty promptly and service was smooth. I had the filet mignon which was good although I would have preferred it to be medium rare, however I understand that they had to make them all the same to serve a large party. After dinner we were served vanilla ice cream in wine glasses and the wedding cake. Then we were ushered back downstairs for more drinks and festivities. \n\nLike I said at the beginning of the review, I can only judge this restaurant based on the service for the wedding, and based on this experience I had a nice time.

While the service was nowhere near as good as we expect from the McCormick's franchise, our overall experience was decent.\n\nThe cost here is what you would expect and very spendy. We only eat at McCormicks for special occasions and being a temporary resident of the area this fit the bill. To be honest $20/person was reasonable for a Thanksgiving day dinner.\n\nThe service was pretty slow and disorganized, this could have been because the staff was not too interested in working on Thanksgiving. They were very attentive when we spilled a drink on the table which was impressive.\n\nThe food was above average, but the brussell sprouts tasted like they came out of a perfume bottle. I'm guessing that they used too much truffle oil on the sauce.\n\nUnfortunately I have to say that we will not be giving the Wharf area our business again since the City of SF insists on not getting rid of the Bushman.

There were many times where he took drink orders at one end of the table, but didn't bother coming down to our end of the table.  Also, I received my entree a good 5 minutes before anyone else (granted I ordered the seared ahi tuna, so it wasn't like I was concerned about my meal getting cold, but weird still).  Then, one of the gals in our group asked for her steak done medium and it showed up rare... so then she had to wait for them to fix the mistake while we all ate.\n\nYou can't go wrong with the ambiance.. They really knew what they were doing when they designed the restaurant with it's big windows facing the bay, gorgeous lighting and beautiful decor.  The food was not your top quality seafood, but decent.  My ahi dish came with a couple of rice/nori cakes....  but the rice was very dry.  Very disappointing.  The sourdough bread?  AWESOME!

Always fresh, excellent seafood.\n\nWe walked in, expecting a wait - after all, it was a Saturday night about 7PM and we did not have a reservation.

Like they'd just sat under the heat lamps and someone sprinkled citrus-seasoned panko crumbs on them. A disappointment. And my SO's sea bass? Well, it tasted like it was a few days old, and getting to the point where it should not have been served. Fresh sea bass is not fishy, at all. And it was tough, overcooked. But at least the mango salsa or whatever it was masked the fishy flavor. It just seemed sad, somehow - that we're sitting here looking out at the Pacific Ocean (well, the Bay) and the seafood we're eating is uninspired, not fresh, and poorly prepared. \n\nAnother thing worth a mention - and I know this to be absolutely true at cheaper places - don't order wine by the glass. We did, since at higher end places, there are more quality controls in place. Wrong. My pinot gris  tasted like it had been sitting uncorked in the bar fridge for a few days.

We wanted something special and since we are familiar with McCormick and Schmick's here in Seattle, we thought this would be a great choice.  When we arrived, we were told we couldn't be seated yet since our entire party hadn't arrived yet.  While we were waiting, other parties came in that didn't have reservations and were seated at tables by the window.  The two hostesses started looking at us and talking behind a menu and then said we could be seated even though our party hadn't all arrived.  We were given a table far away from the windows.  Our waiter was so busy, he literally RAN between tables.  Fifteen minutes passed between appetizers and salads.  During our meal, the bar manager dragged TWO LARGE, OVERFLOWING GARBAGE cans right past our table. Totally unacceptable! Tables were taken down loudly (doors could have been shut) and carried out past us from the private dining room. My sister and I both ordered the Crab Louie.  It was ice berg lettuce, four pieces of tomato, one egg, and six pieces of cucumber.  There was crab but not a huge amount.  Way overpriced for the salad we were given.   Our dinner took so long that we were the last table to leave.  While we were eating our dessert, the bar manager came over to announce to us that the bar was closed and the door locked.  I would not recommend this restaurant and would be hesitant now to recommend any McCormick and Schmick's restaurants.", "author": "Lynda F."}

Our booth had us seated directly facing the gorgeous sunset...Definitely a great place for dinner around 6 or 7 in the evening. They had a wonderful wine and fresh fish selection on the menu. But I  ended up getting the grilled tuna with watermelon sauce (served with bok choy and rice cake). I can almost say that I enjoyed the ricecake as much as I did the tuna. I know it sounds strange that the rice cake can be soooo good, but it's really no ordinary/bland/stale rice cake. It soaked up the juices from the fish and the watermelon sauce which made each bite oh-so savory. Thicker portions of the fish was cooked really well, but thinner regions of the tuna may have lost too much of the moisture. \n\nThe waittress came by following the entree to drop off the dessert menu. I caught eye of the creme brulee, but I had to resist and save room for other treats. (McCormick & Kuleto;'s is located right in Ghiridelli Square...yummy sundaes)\n\nService was great. The waittress was very attentive. I have a water-overdrinking tendency, and she made sure my cup was at least half way full at all times. We also used a 20 dollar off coupon that we found off of their website. Great deal! We ordered two entrees and it came out to $40 even (including the tip).", "author": "Carrie W."}

I want to give them 4 stars, but their customer service is horrible. When I called to confirm my reservation the lady said she couldn't find my name, and started giving me all this attitude.  Luckily, I was able to make an additional reservation.  I gave this place three stars because we enjoyed the food and they were able to give us a table next to the window.  However, i just hated the way our waitress treated us.  In fact, I looked around at all the other waiters and they all looked just as unenthusiastic and rude.  You would think on a special occasion, they would smile and greet their customers but as soon as we sat down it just seemed as if they wanted to get our order in and get us out.  It doesn't look like i'm the first to complain about the poor service, which shows they obviously don't care because the service doesn't seem to get any better.

If you crave that beautiful view of the city bay just stay outside and dine somewhere else for a delicious seafood meal. Wednesday night our family went to this place for dinner with two out of town guest that were staying at the Fairmont ( we should of ordered room service). It took 20 minutes to get our Arnold Palmers and Wine, 30 minutes for our salads and thankfully only 15 minutes for our entrees. The salads were good. The entrees were terrible. The Crab pasta with Blue Cheese and Sugar Snap peas was disgusting. The pasta was warm then they put cold crab meat on top. Yuck. The Clam with linguini was so spicy all you tasted was red pepper flakes and destroyed the beautiful clams. The scallop dish was over cooked, the shrimp scampi was garlicy (but I think ok) and the filet was cooked right (med-rare) but tiny size. We can't believe that place serves meals like this and charges over $25 for every entree.  There are times when service can make up for the terrible food but the server didn't even try and was overwhelmed.  The dining room was full but there was no site of a manager. This is a terrible representation of SF food and service. My suggestion: take a walk along the bay and go to the Mission District for amazing food and half the price.", "author": "Ryan E."}

All of us are adults ranging from 20 to I'm guessing 75.  The atmosphere at the restaurant is nice - fancy but not stuffy.  The view was great even with a foggy night.  We were able to see across to Sausalito/Tiburon, Angel Island and Alcatraz and watch the sky change color as the sun went down.  One of the Aunts spent a long time staring at the people swimming in the bay and being amazed by it.  I have to admit, I don't know how anyone actually does do that.  Too cold for me.  \nThe service was attentive but not overly.  I have a food allergy and the waiter not only checked the two dishes I asked about but checked on all of the salmon dishes and a couple of other specials just in case I had decided I'd like a different one.  \nAs for the food, I'd give them 3 1/2 stars.  I was not able to eat the crab and shrimp cake appetizers we had so I can't rate them but my son loved it and they disappeared off the table.  \nI had the Clam Chowder as a starter and it was average - nice and creamy but not a knock out.  There was a good balance of clams and potato but I still needed to add my oyster crackers to it.  \nI chose the Grilled Wild Salmon with corn pudding cake and cherry tomato salad. The fish was a little over cooked for my tastes, but then I like my fish very rare so I can't complain about that and I didn't tell them how I wanted my fish done.  The corn pudding was yummy but the tomato salad was a little too vinegary but otherwise tasty.\nMy son had the Mahi Mahi and since I had asked about that dish I knew I could taste it.  It was done very well and I would get it if I go again and it is offered.  It was breaded in Macadamia nuts and served in a milky sauce with plantains as an accompaniment.  I enjoyed the small piece he gave me and he licked his plate clean.\nOther dishes ordered were Fisherman's Stew (a little of everything from the sea including a crawdad that neither of the people who ordered it knew how to get into - I told them to rip it in half and pretend it is a little lobster); grilled scallops and vegetables; penne pasta with salmon; tilapia in a nut crust with fruit salsa and rum sauce; and Petra sole in bread crumbs with mashed potatoes on the side.  Everyone enjoyed their dishes and overall it was a satisfying meal.   The menu changes daily and the fish tasted fresh.  No one ordered wine but they had a nice selection of wines by the glass as well as bottles.  \nOverall I would recommend it for a group gathering.   I wouldn't come here on a \"date\" but for a group like this, it was appropriate and everyone found something that satisfied their particular tastes.", "author": "Karen C."}

Don't order the so-called lobster tail for $34.95 at McCormick & Kuleto's unless you bring a magnifying glass with you.  It may be fresh, but it's the smallest lobster tail I've ever seen.  Not only that, but they serve it in the shell so it appears larger.  By the time you're finished trying to dig the minuscule amounts of flesh out of the shell, you'll be lucky to get three small bites.  I think they told me it was 5 ounces after I commented on the size (or lack thereof), but that must be including the weight of the shell.\n\nI was looking forward to my first lobster tail in decades and was beyond disappointed when I was served this.  Listing this dish on the menu as \"lobster tail\" should be illegal.  To be perfectly fair, it was served with a delicious corn succotash.  I think a less deceptive listing on the menu would have been \"Succotash with petite lobster tail.\"  I also would not recommend the Caesar salad, which was limp.\n\nThat being said, the view is excellent, the decor is nice, and the staff was very friendly and attentive.

After it gets completely dark, not much can be seen.  We got one mixed greens salad and one caesar's salad, and they were not too impressive.  Then, we got one scallops dish which was really yummy and one Petrale sole dish with parmesean cheese, which was good but on the greasy/heavier side.   We cabbed there so we didn't have the parking sticker shock, but yeah, it's pretty darn expensive to park at Ghiradelli Square.  The service was good too.

I specifically asked for the pasta to be al dente (yes yes, I'm a snob), but it was still slightly overcooked.

The party started with servings of hors d'oeuvres - new zealand rack of lamb (turned out to be the best), grilled vegetable lavash, baked scallops, deep fried chicken fingers, and veggie fresh baked pizzas. All were mediocre except the lamb as it was the highlight of the party. \n\nFor our main course, my wife had the filet mignon and lobster thermador stuffed with crab meat and I had the rib-eye steak with garlic prawns (or it could be the other way around, but we shared). \n\nThe steaks were awful, both the filet and rib-eye had a fowl smell to it, like it was going bad or something. Taste-wise, both weren't that much better either, but I think the rib-eye was at least bearable. I couldn't even eat the filet - it was that bad...and I love steak! \n\nLobster thermador was decent, but the grilled prawns was a joke. They're really just shrimp, the medium to large kind, and it definitely tasted more like it was steamed than grilled, kind bland too. \n\nDessert was a joke as well as they brought out a sampler of biscotti, chocolate truffle with raspberry sauce and fruit tart, all in one dish so everyone had to share. But because there were only 2 of each, some didn't really get to taste all different samplers. Not sure why they did it like that. What they expect us to do, split those tiny truffles into 4 pieces? \n\nWell, at least we had a decent guy working behind the bar and basically all the alcohol you can withstand. I'm not much of a drinker, but it's cool to try some of the drinks that I normally would not order in a bar. \n\nAt the end of the night, the only positive thing was the rack of lamb.

It took a long time for him to show up at the table to take our order, and a long time to receive our dinner. We had to get his attention for water refills, to add a salad, to order dessert. If you didn't grab his attention, you would see him frantically rushing from table to table but not yours. This may not have been his fault, he seemed to be covering a large area of the restaurant.\n\nThe meal itself was enjoyable but not spectacular. We had oysters, very fresh and yummy. I ordered swordfish which was done perfectly, the starchy goo aka polenta underneath tasted OK but made me long for a plain pile of mashed potatoes next to rather than smushed under the entree. Creme brulee dessert was good, not good enough to dream about later though. Kudos to them for automatically serving salad dressing on the side. \n\nI would eat here again. It's not good enough to fantasize about, though the oysters and swordfish have crossed my mind more than once. Views from almost any table are fantastic.", "author": "S S."}

Come during happy hour and save huge.  \n\nAs for romantic dining, if you want to spend away, you will love the perfectly cooked seafood, lightly seasoned with California ingredients. think fillets, oysters Rockefeller, half shell platters and whatnot.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-16", "description": "McCormick & Kuleto's is another component of the great selection of seafood restaurants in SF and the Bay Area.  This place has always come recommended from family friends and can say that we have dined here several times over the years when living in the area.\n \nFirst of all, the location is prime.  The restaurant is situated in Ghiradelli Square just up the road from Fisherman's Wharf.  There are definitely crowds around but it is easy to navigate, compared to those down on the Embarcadero.\n\nSitting on the side of a hill, diners are greeted with outstanding views of the Bay which include the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and even a glimpse of Sausalito on a clear day/night.  Parking is fairly easy to get due to the abundance of meters and parking garages in the area, plus they will validate your parking for you.\n \nThe decor is what you would expect with the white table clothes and wood accents, however, this is definitely not upscale.  Reservations are recommended but I have seen people walk in off the street and get a table.  The typical crowd here are locals but you get plenty of tourists as well.  Dress is causal but don't be surprised to see a sports jacket or business suit at an adjacent table.\n \nThe food is extremely fresh and the menu reflects what has been caught that day.  You can get your typical appetizers and entrees that you would find on most seafood restaurants, but there are a few surprised items featured on the menu.  I've never had a complaint about the quality of the food and the wait staff is always willing to help you with your selections.  As a further enticement to visiting McCormick & Kuleto's, you can skip the dessert menu and head next door to Ghiradelli to grab some ice cream while taking a pleasant after dinner stroll.\n \nMcCormick & Kuleto's is a welcome break from the usual Fisherman's Wharf seafood restaurants and features a great selection of fresh seafood (as well as some meat options) which is complemented by a good wine selection.  The views are absolutely fantastic and the decor is what you expect.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking to break away from the usual tourist locations, you won't be disappointed.  Definitely a great place for a dinner date.", "author": "Trent C."}

I live in VA and I ate here one unfortunate Saturday evening when I was visiting my best friend in CA. I had really been looking forward to the trip because I was 13 weeks pregnant and it was one of my last chances to travel to see my friend.  I ate some cereal in the am and spent the day walking around Golden Gate Park before heading here for an early dinner.  I had the crab cakes and some clam chowder and became dangerously ill within hours of the meal.\n\nI should preface this by saying - I am not crazy.  Besides this incident, I was never sick during my pregnancy.  I worked 12 hours shifts up until the end no problem.  I have never had another case of food poisoning besides this one.  I have never been a sick patient in a hospital besides this one time.  I am a nurse so I feel like I have a pretty fair perspective on what happened to me.  There is no reason why a pregnant person shouldn't be able to eat the meal that I ordered at this restaurant.\n\nI spent the entire night violently ill before having to go the hospital where I was diagnosed with food poisoning.  My trip was ruined. I had to spend an additional $600 in hospital bills that wasn't covered by my insurance.  And most frightening of all, I came dangerously close to losing my son (he just turned 2 now and is the joy of my life.)  \n\nAfter the incident, I contacted M & K to let them know what happened in a very polite manner, hoping that maybe I could save future diners from a similar experience.  I never had any thoughts of lawsuits or anything of the sort, but they were too cowardly and inhuman to even respond to me which I still find completely vile to this day.  Even without admitting any guilt, they could have at least said something about how it was too bad that I had such a bad experience after eating there - something.\n\nI look at my son today and I can't even describe how unreal it feels to think that one silly overpriced meal could have changed my life forever.  Shame on McCormick & Kuleto's for being so careless with their diners lives.  And you still owe me, my son and my family, an apology.", "author": "Nancy T."}

For a $$$ restaurant ($80 for 2) this was BAD BAD food.  I would have ok'd it at a $ price, but under no circumstances was it good food. \n\nThe crab was old.  It was not fresh and by no means alive when it was cooked.  I don't mean that it was freezer burned, but you could tell this was not fresh.\n\nThe next day I had to go to a market, buy a live crab, and cook it - that was good... somethings you just have to do yourself... However, I will say that BOBO's on Lombard at Van Ness is ooo ooo so good for crab.\n\nThe halibut was ok.  It appeared to have been previously frozen though... perhaps not --- by no means something to be bragging about.\n\nThe balance of the meal was just alright - the clam chowder was fine.  The veggies and potatos were as expected... no problems.\n\nNow for the good... and this is the part that makes me feel a bit bad about rating this place so harshly - but FOOD IS FIRST in a restauraunt!  How would you like it if you had a cell phone that couldn't dial out, but had every other feature.... thats this kind of restauraunt.\n\nService: I'll give service a great rating i dunno - better than most.  The people there were willing to help with everything.  Love the people hate the food.\n\nLocation: great view.  Gotta love the view.\n\nCondition of the restauraunt: Nice - pretty clean.  Good people there.\n\nMoral of this story: restaurant has just become complacent... get some better food people.

He also forgot who had what (there were only two of us) - and that one of us ordered a regular salad with our food - not the pasta salad that we were given. The pasta had the color of the slices of red onion that it sits in - it looked like bruised pasta salad. The long sitting food did not sit well with us (we ate because we were hungry and on our lunch hour). When asked for more ketchup/mayo etc - yes we had to ask for it, the waiter would only bring it in the small, mini containers (what - no bottles?)

It's very expensive, at least for me.  Can only come here on special occasion. Food is generally good and service is what you expect to be at this price of food.  Four stars because I'm a fan but can't go whenever I want to, have to look out for my wallet.  Expect for $50/person easily and you can tell they are looking forward for a big tip.  Great for dating, I meant the 1st one or an anniversary.  Since you are there, as well go for Ghirardelli Ice Cream and Chocolate Shop.", "author": "P. C."}

He really went all out to find a nice romantic place with a pretty view. It's too bad that we came at the time when the fog starting to roll in. Anyway, the decor inside is beautifully decorated with shell-like lighting fixtures and colors of brown for trimming and a dark shade of coral/pinkish wallpapers. The tables are situated on three tiers so anywhere you sit, you can get a view of the bay. \nThe place is really packed on a Friday night, so the boyfriend was lucky to make reservations or else we'd have to wait. The host seated us right away, so there wasn't a long wait to have our table ready. Not even a few minutes, our waiter came with our menus, basket of bread and our glasses of water. \nI didn't know the menu changes each day, so it's never the same...Well, that's what my boyfriend told me and so did the waiter. Awesome! Plus, he gave recommendations after I asked him what he would suggest if I wanted to try something for the first time and get a good experience out of my meal. A lot of the stuff he mentioned were all seafood (duh! we're around fisherman's wharf and the pier), but I order their 8 oz. Ribeye Steak and my boyfriend ordered a 9 oz. sirloin steak. I would've gone with a seafood dish, but I decided upon steak instead. We waited for a few minutes before our food came out.\nNice presentation for their meals. I wasn't too fond of their mashed potatoes, because it wasn't as fluffy and moist. Although, the potatoes came well with the mushroom sauce that was drizzled on top of the steak. Yummy! I wish the chef had cooked it right, because I asked for medium but it came out medium well. The steak itself wasn't anything special. I kind of regret not ordering a seafood dish. \nSince my boyfriend wasn't feeling too well, I ordered us some hot tea. The waiter came out with a selection of tea...Jasmine, Chinese black tea, mint, lemon, etc. All from Numi. We got the Jasmine and Chinese Black Tea. We enjoyed it much! I kept asking for more hot water. Our waiter was really nice about it and really friendly too. Didn't know he had jokes, but he sure got a good laugh out of us. Too bad I forgot his name. Bummer!\nI suggest that the people who take care of the bathrooms, need to refill/stock up on the paper towels and mop up the floors. Really disgusting.\nSurprisingly, we didn't get to finish our food but we did enjoy the tea a lot more. I guess we were to awed by their service, the beautiful interior of the restaurant, and a somewhat spectacular view of the bay. I'd come by again, but I'll have to try a seafood dish instead.", "author": "Fraulein C."}

While waiting for the last of our party, two of us sat at the bar for a pre dinner half bottle of wine.  We opted for the Grgich Hills Fume Blanc 2005 which was excellent!  Just what I was looking for -- light and crispy.  The bartender (who looked a tad like Steve Martin, I say) was classic... he sounded like he ran the place... and maybe he did, who knows.  He was very knowledgeable about the various fresh seafood of the world-- which is their specialty, and also very well versed on the wine selections.  \n\nSo, eventually we were seated at a table by the large windows overlooking the bay.  Our waitress had a weird awkwardness to her... always popping in for a quick update or question and as it came time for any of us to respond she was already practically leaving the table.  One of my friends even noted, to my agreement, that she had a way of standing very very close to us.  This is all good for a giggle, and didn't really ruin our time... but funny to remember.  Also when she would bring us a plate, she would not excuse herself or prepare the landing space before she began to place it on the table, but would kind of just plop it down on top of things.  Odd!  She even picked up one of our dine about town menus and put it right on top of our bread.  Curiouser and curiouser!  When she brought my steak knife as she was passing our table, we were in the midst of a conversation and she tucked it under my elbow.  HAHA... very comical.  Anyhow, I ended up not doing the dine about town and ordered the porkchop which was delicious, tender and juicy (I don't much eat seafood) and my friends' crab cakes and halibut (? or salmon) made them happy.. and the apple crisp with vanilla ice cream was suuuper good.  Getting to be my favorite dessert.  Good times.", "author": "Marjorie B."}

My bf got the grilled Mahi with green Thai sauce which was very, very good. He doesn't really like seafood other than crab legs but he took a chance with the Mahi and was very impressed. My oldest kid got the Salmon which was also pretty darn good. He loves seafood and of course ate every last drop. I ordered the roasted vegetable purse which was not very good...Okay, not at all good (just thinking about it now is turning my stomach). My younger son got the fettuccini marinara and it was not any good either; overcooked pasta and weird, oddly spicy, yet tasteless, marinara sauce....Bleh. My little one didn't eat but 3-4 bites. Their drinks are good. I had some terrific lemony vodka things (at 10-12 bucks each...OUCH) and my bf got some absinthe thing that was super yum. \nSo: To recap here.....Great service, two yummy seafood dishes served with two horrible non-seafood dishes, great mixed drinks and a fun location equals 4 out of 5 stars....I guess. \nMy suggestion, ORDER SEAFOOD and combine with great company.", "author": "Kelly O."}

I have eaten at their affiliated restaurants (McCormick and Schmidt) and have liked them for what they are: an upscale seafood and steak chain (and I'm not anti-chain).  Still, this place just did not cut it.  I started with the clam chowder.  It was bland, gloopy and tasteles; consistency of glue with not discernable taste (or texture) difference between the clams and diced potatoes.  I had the scampi with shrimp, to which I added crab.  The linguini pasta was way overcooked (and, for some strange reason, in very small pieces).  The five or six shrimp were fine, if a bit overcooked (which in my experience, is often the case when you order shrimp pasta).  The fiew pieces of crab were fine.  Overall, not worth the price.

The menu had listed crab and so we were happy.  When the waiter came to the table he said that there was no crab and the menu was incorrect.  I know that menu is printed daily (so what's up with that?)\nHe went on to say they had not received any crab and were at the mercy of deliveries.\nWhen I said how disappoint we were as we wanted at least 4 crab dinners and a few bottles of wine, he said he would check with the kitchen.  When returning with another person, I was then told that the crabe they received was too small and the chef is very particular about what he prepares.\nNeedless to say, our party of 7 left the beautiful view for a crab dinner elsewhere.  \nNot too happy with this experience.

Both of us were starving, and someone brought us water and bread after about 10 minutes, even though we had already decided what we were getting before then.

The server looked surprised and said, \"Oh, they were going to come out after your clam chowder.\" Umm....I guess I didn't realize that appetizers are supposed to come out AFTER your  meal?? After finishing the bread bowls, we waited about another 10 minutes until the crab came, and when the server dropped it off he asked if we'd like another round of bloodys. We said yes, but by the time he brought them we had already finished the crab legs. I'm not exactly sure how long that was, but think about the length of time it takes to crack and eat about 6 crab legs....yeah. It was awhile. And I usually prefer to enjoy my drinks WITH my food. Overall, service sucked big time, my boyfriend still left a 20% tip but let's just say the server was lucky that he picked up the tab this time and not me. Two stars because the food itself was AWESOME as well as the drinks....but if it wasn't for that this place would definitely get a one star.", "author": "Nicole B."}

Now please...stay away from the filet mignon unless tough and flavorless dead cow is what you're looking for because you're a T-Rex with razor sharp murder teeth.\nAlso they are more than happy to let you sample the wines before you purchase a glass so I would recommend  taking them up on the offer if you're a picky pretentious wanna be wine snob or just cheap.\nMy rant: I wish there was a dress code because the classy atmosphere of the restaurant suffers at the expense of poorly dressed fanny pack wearing tourist who completely adulterate the mood.", "author": "Vicky V."}

Most of us in our group were local but we were entertaining out of town friends so I understand that the majority of the patrons were tourists.  Our server was so sick that she could hardly speak or be heard so we never heard if there were any specials or recommendations on the menu.  I would think that the management would either assist this obviously laboring server by asking other staff member to assist or send her home to rest her voice.  Many of us at the table wondered about the poor image and feeling customers get when being served by someone who could be contagious.  The real kicker was the surprise 'Health Tax' that was itemized on our bill (roughly 3.5%), when we asked our server about it, we of course could not hear what she had to say since she needed the health benefits that this tax apparently supports.  Why would a restaurant itemize such an item unless it's some form of a protest against this city mandated tax on restaurant owners?  To me, the restaurant loses a referral and a customer due to this form of passing the cost to it's customers.  The City also loses in that we will now think less than twice about dining in the city to need to pay 8.5% + 3.5% + deserving gratuity of 15% = 27% in addition to what is charged for just the food on the menu!  \n\nDon't mind at all IF the service, food, atmosphere were all right.

Seriously, for a nice, decent restaurant with fresh dishes - the seafood was pretty good - located at one of the busiest areas of San Francisco (the Wharf), this is good bang for your buck. I'd definitely go out here again.", "author": "Chris A."}

First, you must sit in the bar for the happy hour specials. I guess I should have assumed this but we made reservations and when they said we had to sit in the overly crowded bar area to partake in happy hour we were less than thrilled.  After too many minutes goes by without being greeting by anyone we finally flag someone down and they say someone else needs to help us, not them. Ok, but who?? Our server finally came around and she was obviously very frazzled, we actually just felt bad for her.  Our food took forever and it all came out at the same time.  Pretty sure when people order appetizers they expect them to come out before the main course. Anyway, food was ok, service was poor but I am attributing this to lack of staff, not 100% a bad server.", "author": "Kate V."}

The hostess ignored us for a couple minutes even though we were right by the entrance door. What a bad first impression for an expensive restaurant. We then asked nicely if we could get a table by the window.  Lucky for us! We got a really bad server. He's a gray-haired man with a really weird vibe. He was mumbling to himself and sneered at us a couple times. Not sure why. His tips was hand-written on the bill by him even though there were only 4 of us. Later on, we found out that the restaurant charged us 3 times for it. We had to call the restaurant 4 times to clarify the charges. They hung up on us \"accidentally\" 3 times in a row. Overall: very bad service, ok food, & nice view if you get window seating. Don't think I'll ever come back to this restaurant again!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-12-11", "description": "This place deserves a flat out zero! I've been working in the restaurant business for over 10 years and have been a server for over seven years and I know the difference in crappy, mediocre, and exceptional service.  As for this place, it is by far the worst place that I have ever been to.  \n\nHere's how it all started... \nI made a reservation about 2 months in advance as a surprise for my boyfriend's birthday.  Right when we got there, we checked in and were asked to wait even though the place was empty.  Then, when we were seated, we looked through the menu for a good 5 minutes and noticed that our server never came to greet us.  Since I'm a server, I assumed that our server was busy and couldn't get to us.  However, since the place was practically empty, that surely couldn't have been the reason.  Since it was my boyfriend's birthday I didn't want to make a scene, so we waited around some more.  About 20 minutes later, the server finally came up and asked us for our drinks. Right when she arrived at our table, we could already tell that she wasn't too happy to see us.  As she was neither friendly or polite,  we quickly ordered our appetizers, soup, and drinks.  After she left, it took her another 15 minutes to bring me my iced tea and my boyfriends wine.  Then, instead of taking our meal orders, she left and didn't return for another 20 minutes.  Our server was basically non-existent.  Must I remind you, it was a Monday night and it was not busy what-so-ever.  We were one of her TWO WHOLE TABLES! Anyway, throughout the course of our meal, our server never once came back to check up on how our food tasted, how everything was going, and if we needed anything.  She totally walked passed our table and ignored us.  She was however extremely friendly and attentive to the table right next to us.  (older Caucasian table) This has by far been the worst restaurant experience of my life.  I think Chuck'E'Cheese has better service than this.  \n\nAgain, our server was not friendly nor polite.  Obviously she was stereotyping my boyfriend and I.  Just because we're an Asian couple in our 20's doesn't mean that we'll skimp you on your tip. First of all, this obviously isn't the cheapest of restaurants out there. Second, we don't look the slightest bit ghetto.  Third, if we're dressed for the occasion then that obviously means something!   It's ridiculous, must I tattoo SERVER on my forehead to indicate that I tip upon how my service was.  I usually tip 20%+ and have never skimped anyone on a tip.  Being a server myself, I never stereotype my guests and treat them all the same.  In fact, my biggest tippers are younger guests of an ethnic background.  All I have to say is that this place doesn't even deserve to have a one star rating.\n\nI WILL NEVER MAKE A RETURN VISIT AND WON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE.", "author": "Diana T."}

Any additions, alcoholic beverages, etc... will need to billed individually to the person who incurred those charges. We even went as far as to say that if our driver were able to join them he will pay for his meal on his company card. They noted that we would pre-cut a check for the group.\nApproximately an hour after our event we receive a phone call informing us that there is a balance due. Mind you we pre-paid for 51 people, only 49 people showed up. So they are ahead by two people. The extra charge was due to the fact that 2 people decided they wanted a different entree (one of the 3 entrees that we offered on our pre-set menu) so they charged us $13 each for the change. They didn't inform us or the people that changed their mind that there would be a charge.\nWe have had problems with their corporate offices in the past and had just started using their restaurants again.

The Seabass was a little on the salty side, so I just flipped it over and ate the bottom part rather than the salted crusty grilled side.  The vinegrette sauce with the seabass didn't really go well with the fish, but great with the bland, white rice.  It also came with the sauteed string beans and 1 baby carrot.  (no flavor).

I will start out by saying it is somewhat a pet peeve of mine when you actually have a reservation at a restaurant, show up at said time, and then proceed to wait about 15 minutes for your table. I know a busy place can have problems turning tables over, but it was certainly not that busy and I have a philosophy that reservation holders should take precedent over walk-ins. Decor inside is nice, the tables are on three tiers, so most of the tables have no problem getting the view of the Bay, which is cool. Now onto my next pet peeve, the bread and water rule. Bread (or something to nosh on) and water should hit your table fairly promptly. I am all for restaurants that withhold water unless requested as a conservation measure, but most restaurants that do this actually have something on the table that informs you of their policy. Anyhow, bread got there eventually and water, too, once I asked for it. The timing of the dishes was weird. Salads came suspiciously fast, leaving a long wait between them and the entree. Then came the lag between finishing dinner and the dessert pimping followed by a ridiculously long wait for the desserts themselves. The waiter was nice enough, but forgot our request for a second bottle of wine until it was too late. My water was not refilled once (I didn't ask, but I shouldn't have to). Portions were OK, a little on the skimpy side since flavor-wise, they weren't worth the price. I would call the food passable, neither very good nor very bad.

The whole restaurant smelled that way, from the moment we walked in.  Why?  I have no idea how this happens.  I thought the food was good, but not for the price.  This place is a tourist trap - great view, convenient location, San Francisco seafood classics like clam chowder and cioppino, and a price that shows you are paying for location.  I had the cioppino, which had lots of goodies but was incredibly salty and some of the seafood was a bit overdone.  Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a problem because I'm not picky, but the dish cost $30 for brunch, so the overcooking was a bummer.  My partner's dover sole was way too rich.  Our guests enjoyed their lobster salad and crab omelette, so no complaints on those dishes.  We were entertaining tourists, so it was actually not a bad place to go for brunch, but anyone who actually lives here has many, many better options.", "author": "audrey y."}

Susan Richardson is their catering manager, and she made the planning experience simple and the event itself flawless and memorable. The Russian woman who served as our world-class captain (I'm sorry I've forgotten her name) kept things moving and handled everything gracefully and with charm and competence. The evening started with drinks--stocking the special whiskey we'd requested--and passed hors d'oeuvres, and guests stood out on the private terrace looking at the views and the people passing by, a first-rate location. Our hosts decided to let everyone order from the menu, and it was a feast that pleased everyone. The evening came in at about $212 per person, including fine wines, drinks, dinner, tips, tax, room charge. Our host got his money's worth and some.", "author": "Peter P."}

They have jazzed it up a notch with those sweeping views of the bay.  Tip: sit on the top level as you can get an allaround better view that way.  The service is very friendly and they will answer any questions that you may have.  The bread is fresh from the oven with wonderfully smooth, cremy butter.  The Hangtown fry is to die for with good size fresh, neaty oysters (not sure which kind,) crispy, greasless bacon, and fresh tomatos served fritata style in which the fritata is crispy and smooth.  The green beans accompaniing the dish are excellent sauted in garlic and olive oikl.  I also some tried of my uhncle's fish and chips; the piece of fish was greasless and crispy (I think that it could have been white fish or cod) with tarter sauce that tasted homemade and not too mayonessey; the fries were crispy and greasless.  What a fitting meal on a hot bay area day, let alone a rarely hot San Francisco day.  So, for excellent seafood for a little mmore than your typical moderately priced restaurant with friendly service in a casual, yet upscale atmosphere, McCormick and Kuleto's cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.!", "author": "Brian S."}
