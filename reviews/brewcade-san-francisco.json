It's a small barcade with some games, a bar, and a huge tv screen that was playing the basketball game. Chill vibes, however, the biggest issue I had was when we were trying to play the games, MAJORITY OF THEM, DID NOT WORK. I mean it didn't say out of order so we proceeded to insert our coins and then it would \"start\" but then the buttons don't work or the players won't move. It happened to us on a few games and we were too lazy to ask for a refund.

As a bar, it's super meh.\n\nThe game selection is excellent, with some pinball, some classics, some fighting games, a racer or two, and some shooting games. Even though they don't swap games out as much as I'd like, the ones they do have are always in working order. They're also not too busy; there's definitely an exciting atmosphere from the other patrons being around, but you won't have to wait all night to play a game you want.\n\nBrewcade also has Killer Queen! It forces you to talk to strangers, but it's a hell of a game that will entertain you and your friends for hours. It's sort of like a MOBA, I guess, but without the rage that League and Dota are wont to cause.\n\nThe bar is just okay. The beer selection is okay, but nothing incredible. They have wine slushies, which are fun and unique, but again, nothing life-changing. I'm more of a cocktail guy anyway, and they have none of those.\n\nIt also gets bonus points for allowing myself and my mom to bond over old games from her youth, something I've very much struggled to do in the past.

It's called, \"Brewcade!\" Brewcade serves the customers to experience their old school arcade vibes from playing classic arcade and pinball games to endless assortments of drinks from beer to cocktails all night long! The atmosphere is very active and on-going as I welcomed there. The concept is pretty simple filled with a combination of an arcade room and a dive bar; all-in-one. The decors is much modern and dark filled with hanging lights across the whole interior room.\n\nThe employees here especially bartenders are doing a great job for making the customers like me a remarkable and tremendous service despite the busiest environment. No cons.\n\nNow onto the experience! Inside, they have good selections of well known arcade games from Super Mario Bros VS, Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga, Rally-X, Rampage, The Simpsons, Street Fighter II etc including the mostly popular game, the 5-vs-5 favorite, Killer Queen! Pinball games are still there while entering the front door too! Games costs between 25 to 50 cents. How cool is that!?\n\nAs for the drinks. I did ordered one of their available brewery selections: the Ruhstaller 1881 California Red Ale. While I drank that beer, it tasted quite good for that Sacramento brewery's signature beer. Crisp and refreshing.\n\nIn some occasions, Brewcade has tons of video gaming tournament parties every year, so it's a plus for modern video gaming addicts to show how these participating teams will battle their fate. Fun and mesmerizing!\n\nParking at Brewcade can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking if it's available during peak times. Alternatively, you can ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nAll in all, Brewcade is the most incredible and interesting local arcade bar that I've ever visited for the very first time in San Francisco! Perfect for friends gathering! A well received and planning to come back for more! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

There aren't that many seats here, as the floor space is devoted to games, games, and more games, but the vibe is still boisterously social. There's also a surprisingly good, comprehensive beer list. Service is fast and efficient. \n\nSince it's about games, the vibe is different that it would be if it were simply a bar or a dance club, but there are plenty of those places in the neighborhood already.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-27", "description": "Honestly, to truly enjoy this place, you should get there early with a friend or two. On busy nights it gets wicked crowded, which can ruin its charm, appeal and your ability to enjoy it. \n\nThat said, I have an affinity for Brewcade because it's where my girlfriend and I had our first date. We shared a few craft beers which were fun to choose from, since they're largely local and unique. We played the vintage arcade games (badly) but enjoyed every minute. \n\nFast forward to my most recent visit, which occurred during Pride weekend whilst showing a friend from home around the city / Castro. The bartenders were all grade \"A\" cuties, very attentive and friendly with us being two of six or so guests. Working in the industry, it can be easy to take advantage of slow hours - you'll be on your feet all night and day interacting with throngs of people just trying to get drunk so you avoid when you can. I've seen it and I've been there, but these guys were the exact opposite. \n\nWe had wonderful conversations with the guys working and even played a couple rounds of Mario Kart on the projector screen with them. I've always been a fan of Brewcade but this experience really made my friend visiting feel at home, and he raved about it the rest of his visit!\n\nANYWAY, on to the details, and if you skipped ahead I don't blame you. \n\nThis spot serves up really delicious craft beer as well as a few wines on tap and a couple of sugary cocktails. It all fits the theme but I really appreciate their beer list since it's actually quite well put together. Anyway, prices can be a tad steep, but you're paying for atmosphere, fun, and craft beer, so can you really complain? \n\nThey also do video game tournaments and movie nights, though I've yet to participate in either so I can't speak on them personally. \n\nAt the end of the day, I dig this place, but I'll likely avoid it during peak hours and opt instead for a low-key afternoon or early happy hour to truly catch the vibe.", "author": "Alex K."}

Perhaps in part to the fact I had amazing friends w me, but overall the venue was great. \n\nFirst off, the service was great. I can't remember for the life of me the name of the bartender and bouncer that helped us but they were tremendously friendly and helpful. \n\nAs an arcade, the place had less games than I was expecting but provides a wide range of classics, pinball, fighting, shooter games, and also a tv to play Mario Kart in (a blast, honestly). They also have Killer Queen, which I thought stole the show for the night. Luckily, we went on a Sunday which is a quieter night, and we had a ton of fun meeting other people playing this game. It was our first time seeing it. It's a fabulous up to 10 player vs. co-op game that lets you meet and talk to strangers and is endlessly entertaining. As for the bar, we really enjoyed the wine slushies, which were pricey for what they were but delicious nonetheless. \n\nOverall, this is a place I could see myself frequenting if I lived in the area, but for now I guess I'll just have to visit whenever I'm in town.", "author": "Victoria L."}

It's not a huge place but they probably have 20+ machines of all sorts of arcade games (classic, sports, driving, fighting, pinball, etc.). I believe you can also ask them for a console to play Mario Kart on. I'm not sure how that works as we didn't do so on this occasion. I could see how on a busier night you'd have to wait if you don't feel like playing with strangers. There also isn't much seating so if you're hoping to leave your stuff at a table and play, that might be harder to do.  \n\nIt's a really cool ambiance with the lighting, decor and the sounds from the machines. It'd be a great place for a date. \n\nThe only thing is that some of the machines are a bit older and not completely functional. You may have some quarters eaten here or there, notice some calibration errors on the pinball machines or find that a few buttons on the machines don't work. Overall it's not a huge deal, just wish there was a little more attention paid to this (maybe a warning label for the controls that aren't working).", "author": "Emily L."}

That way, it'll be better to play the arcade games if I barely communicate with any strangers whenever I sit between them.  I was about to have a drink first before I walked towards the arcade behind me.  I asked the bartender if there is at least one non-alcoholic Spritzer.  Then he said there are two choices: bottled sodas or a kombucha.  So I settled for a kombucha and watched the big screen.  Of course, I'll be ready to buy a glass of wine or beer on my second visit.  Anyway, I had to finish up my whole glass so I can play the arcade.  No need to pay again for the refill.  I'll do that if I have enough time and money to burn.\n\nLet's see!  Marvel vs Capcom?  Joust?  No coin holes for Whac-A-Mole, but I did indeed scored 160 points back in Muse\u00e9 Mecanique.  Superb, non?  Perhaps I'll go for Killer Queen.  I chose the blue side of the two large arcade machine.  I wasn't here to score to win.  I was testing the controls after putting four quarters.  That's how the game works.

The female bar tender, while not friendly or inviting, at least got our drink order together.  The male bartender appeared about 40-50 minutes later - I was sitting at a table repacking my backpack when he took my water bottle off the table.  When I told him it wasn't trash he brought it back over and stated to get rid of it because outside beverages aren't allowed and walked off.  Note - this was the first and only interaction with this guy.  Regardless, there is a way to interact with people and treat them with respect.  Especially guests in your city.\n\nSecondly, there were many games, however, close to half of them had notes describing how to get around the menus.  Several of the game consoles appeared to be unauthorized knock off's.

They don't serve food, but I've seen people come in with outside food on occasion, with no issues. There are lots of arcade games to play (lots of classics!), though the one I probably spend the most time on is Killer Queen, a 5v5 game in the corner of the bar near the entrance. It's definitely a game that attracts people to Brewcade since there are twice weekly league nights (one for serious players, and another one that's a casual meetup).

They also have a number of themed nights that allow you to easily meet up friends for a fun time or kill a number of hours prior to another event. (aka a good pre-game spot) With the number of arcade games around the place, I'd have to say that the most appealing and more popular is the Killer Queen arcade game.

This is one of the few places that has Killer Queen, which is a super fun, multiplayer versus game. It fits 5 people on each machine at a time so it engages a large group of players and also spectators. The pinball machines are in pretty good conditions. They have Demolition Man, Spider Man, Ghostbusters, Adams Family, and Game of Thrones. This is a pretty diverse set of machines in one place. I would come here just for the pinball machines but not at a busy time. Spider Man played pretty slow, which is great for warming up and feeling good about yourself.\n\nThe main issue with this place is how crammed it is. Granted, I came on a Saturday night, but the space itself is just small considering the room you would need for this type of establishment. Compared to other barcades I've to, this is definitely one of the tightest. It's hard to fully enjoy yourself when you keep having to get distracted by people trying to get through.

Brewcade has one of the eighteen Killer Queen arcade machines in the country.  I had no idea what Killer Queen was when the night started, but noticed a lot of mentions of it in the reviews.  We had hours to kill due to an early morning flight and this place stuck out.  Once we got there I saw the 10-player cabinet and eagerly waited for my chance to play.\n\nEventually I had my chance to play with some strangers.  It was a blast.  Easy to pickup, but insanely difficult to master.  The team I was on went back and forth with wins until a new group stepped up on the Blue cabinet.  We mercilessly destroyed them game after game, up until this insane master player joined their team.  Once he joined we got killed over and over.  He was hardcore coaching his team and none of us had any idea how to counter.  We won a few of the following games, but it was crazy.  After a bit some people had to leave and master queen ended up playing 3 vs. 1.  It was wild.\n\nI haven't had this much fun playing a game in years.  It was amazing and a great social experience.  The rest of the place seemed pretty awesome as well, plenty of variety in arcade games for you to play.  I don't drink, but they did seem to have a decent lineup of drinks for those that do.  They also actually had a really good lineup of non-alcoholic drinks as well.  \n\nI wish there were more places around Salt Lake that offered things like this.

Although I had had this place bookmarked/on my radar I didn't realize I was passing by it until my boyfriend noticed the chess board tables outside.  Us both being the chess nerds we are decided to grab a beer and play a game.  Brewcade is small and unassuming, the walls are lined with vintage arcade games all at pretty affordable prices (I believe cheaper than a place like Golden Gate Tap Room).  The beer selection, although unique and excellent was a bit pricey.  Board games are free you just need to leave your ID behind the bar.

I went on a Saturday and it was really crowded, I had to wait outside for 5-10 minutes. The demographic is pretty typical of SF, super diverse: folks from Castro, people on dates, college friends, etc. \n\nOverall, I think it's a fun concept at a reasonable price. Beers are $7-10 and arcade games are .50 cents a round. They also have still or sparkling water and are efficient with their bathroom systems (sinks on the outsides and non gender discriminatory bathrooms).

It was actually a bit overwhelming for me since I'm still new to enjoying beers and figuring out which I like, but I would much rather have too many options than too few! It's great for those who aren't sure which beer they will like or want to try something new; the bartenders are helpful and willing to describe the various options, give suggestions, and more importantly let you sample a few to be sure you find one you like before making your final choice. The one I decided on (which I can't remember the name of ) was described on the large wall-side menu as a hazelnut beer. It was true to the description and delicious! The other drink I had was the frozen wine one. It tasted just like frozen champagne. It was pretty good but I was expecting something a little fruitier. To be fair, I ordered it by referring to it as \"the frozen drink\" and hadn't realized it was wine afterwards. Still pretty tasty. I also enjoyed the arcade games that line the bar. They have games ranging from Rush (yessss!) to Pacman to Pinball.\nI enjoyed it overall, 4 stars for only having beer and wine, but I would be happy to go back again!", "author": "Shav S."}

They cater to a specific demo, but fortunately for them, that demo makes up a large portion of San Francisco's population. Our company threw a party here last week and everyone had a great time. \n\nThe craft beer selection is awesome (I stuck to the Summer Porter and Oyster Stout but there were many options for IPA lovers) and they even have a water station, complete with still and sparkling taps. A few people in our party opted for wine and ended up drinking out of water cups since there were no wine glasses. Not what I would call classy, but hey, it's an arcade. \n\nBring lots of quarters! Most games are 50 cents (2 player = $1) with a few exceptions. They have a great variety so there's really something for everyone. To name a few: Buck Hunter, Tekken, Street Fighter II, Marvel vs. Capcom, Pacman, Mrs. Pacman, 1942 (!!!!), Frogger, 2 racing games, 3 or 4 pinball machines (including Addams family!) and just as many other games that I can't name.", "author": "Shaina V."}

It's like Wunderland grew up right along with us.\n\nWe popped into Brewcade to kill a couple of hours with a couple of beers and a couple of rounds of pinball. Pretty much everything in Brewcade is 50 cents a play, which isn't outrageous, but I would have much rather everything been a quarter. That's how Wunderland would have done it. From a nickle to a quarter, that seems like fair inflation when wages have been so stagnant.\n\nThe beer selection is great. They had grapefruit Sculpin on tap and being from San Diego, I always like to see Ballast Point doing well in other markets. They have two different \"cocktails\" that are made from various beers and wine. I went with the Grape Drank which is a wine slurpee. Honestly, I couldn't get through it. Everything was just too acidic for my taste, but other's mileage may vary.\n\nThe old school game selection was good. Staples like Pac Man and arcade Super Mario were represented. Kiss Pinball was there (at a dollar a play though), as was Demolition Man, one of the most complicated mechanical hybrid pinball machines produced. There were also some newer games like Tekken 5 as well. One of my favorites, Marvel versus Capcom is here as well, though the screen is a bit wonky. I think you may have a migraine if you play that one too long.\n\nAll in all, a lot of fun to be had here and an easy place to kill a couple hours.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-02", "description": "Alright, let's start with the common complaints.\n\nYes, the layout leads to it getting insanely cramped around the cabinets. Yes the beer is slightly pricey (depending on what you order). And yes, some of the cabinets seem to eat quarters (though this may be a misconception: see below).\n\nTo the first point, just don't come on a weekend night if you don't want to squeeze past some group in order to play Bust-a-Move. This is much better as a weekday retreat from responsibility and the real world, not a weekend nightlife spot (there are plenty of those within walking distance).\n\nSecond, the beer selection is actually pretty good, featuring Bay Area breweries (Fort Point and Berryessa to name a few notables). Do you pay $7 for that pint? Sure. But this is San Francisco, and on the edge of the Castro...wtf do you expect? I'd say the beer selection and pricing are better than most, though to be sure it's no \"craft beer bar\".\n\nAnd third, I started to suspect that the cabinets I chose to play (of which there is a good variety) that \"ate quarters\" did so because most people did not realize they were $.50 to play. Putting one quarter in most of them gives you no sense that you need to put another one in to actually play, so people got frustrated and walked away. Sure, there was one machine I spent $.75 on to play, but everything else seemed to work just fine. Again, this plays back to my first point, don't go on a weekend!\n\nSure there's no Simpsons, X-Men, or TMNT, but there are plenty of fun cabinets to get your nostalgia going. A few cabinets have multiple games to choose from as well. I'll admit, playing \"Willow\" as an arcade game wasn't for me, but there's something for everyone, be it puzzle games, platformers, or shooters.\n\nAnd what makes it even better? A metal holster for your beer next to almost every cabinet, making it a breeze to set your brew down without worry of knocking it over during your spastic, killer combos in Marvel vs Capcom.\n\nSolid four stars. Not the best arcade around, but it delivers on what it promises. Plus, iced Sumptown coffee on nitro?? Hell yes.", "author": "Jeff R."}

Granted they might bring in more games and change the interior, the arcade side of things seemed like an afterthought. \n\nWhat did we play? We tried playing a game (I forgot the name, but basically you're a half naked guy fighting wolves and monsters), and even though the game was supposed to be two-players, it wouldn't allow more than one of us to play. We lost a bunch of quarters trying to get it to work, but nope. \n\nOh, and as soon as one of us put some metal song on the jukebox, whoever is running the show decided to just play their own playlists and ignore the dollars spent on the jukebox. \n\nSo we came out thinking we could give it another chance a couple of months down the line, when all the kinks are sorted out.

Similar sounding name aside, Brewcade really has to do a bit of work to catch up to the awesomeness that is Barcade. The gaming area is pretty cramped and it's weird basically being butt to butt with other gamers. And while the initial list of games mentioned a few pinball machines there are no pins to be found. One last gripe about the games - it would be neat if they kept a list of top scores (again, like Barcade does)\n\nOn the Brew side of things, Brewcade has a great selection of beer and actually a lot of interesting non alcoholic options. I haven't tried the snacks but it's nice that they do have some munchies available and also let you bring food in from the outside. There are plenty of tables to hang out while waiting for games to become available, actually I think they have too many tables. They could easily remove a few tables to spread out the games (or add some pinball!)\n\nOverall, Brewcade is off to a pretty solid start. I've had a lot of fun going during non peak hours but when it's packed, it gets annoyingly crowded.

From the same folks as Blackbird down the street, a lot of people (myself included) were looking forward to a new beer bar. Plus, they would have video games?! Sweet!\n\nWhile Blackbird has its charm and ambiance, Brewcade is a much more minimal/sterile. The neon greed BREWCADE sign in enchanting at night, I will say, but not much else. There is plenty of space, it seems, for large groups of thirsty gay (?) nerds to gather. It was an odd hour, so the place wasn't full on my visit.\n\nThe beer selection is exhausting-- there should be something for everyone. There are some fizzy non-alcoholic things to be had as well. Small snacks are available, and they encourage/allow people to get food from Hecho next-door, or Hi Tops across the street. \n\nNow, about those games. I will admit that I was salivating at the idea that some of these vintage games would be available, bringing up memories of young Bryan throwing his NES controller across the room, or screaming at Sonic the Hedgehog, or inventing new swear words during heated Pokemon battles. (In fact, maybe I should attribute any rage issues to playing video games.. but I digress...)\n\nThe game situation is crowded. Literally. The current configuration has all of the games tucked into a corner in several rows. Most of the games have some sort of beer holder nearby. Since it was slow traffic, we didn't have any elbowing issues, but I could imagine with a larger crowd, it would become downright claustrophobic. Also, if you read the list of arcade games from any news articles, just understand that they will not all be available at once. I was looking forward to reliving my days playing The Simpsons arcade game at the local movie theater-- alas, no such luck on my visit.\n\nAll in all, a great addition in terms of a beer hall, but I don't see myself returning just for the games anytime soon.", "author": "Bryan B."}

I've been waiting and waiting for this place to open since reading about it a while ago on Eater. \n\nOn the good:\nThe service is pretty great. Greeted by a really friendly door guy to check IDs. The bartenders were also really nice, if not slightly overwhelmed by the crowds (there were remnants of Santa Con still around...), but I give 'em a pass--it's opening week!\n\nThe space itself is pretty cool--has a fun vibe and they were playing the Hobbit on a really nice TV. Ample seating and places to stand and talk. They have a magnetic wall thing with letter magnets (reminiscent of Q Restaurant that closed in the Richmond) so you can make dirty words. I think I saw \"Kinky Elf Sex Porn\". Not my thing, but hey, could be hot. \n\nBathrooms were clean and had a cool selection of brews.\n\nThe meh:\nThe selection of games listed on the Eater piece seemed crazyyyy long. When I got there, I was pretty shocked to see how few games there were (plus no Simpsons :( Guess everything's not coming up Millhouse just yet...). I guess in my mind, that list seemed to take up a lot more real estate. As others have mentioned, the whole set-up is really weird. The games run parallel to a communal table so there's a lot of traffic going around the games and they're so tightly packed that if you want to watch a friend play a game or play with them, you'd basically have to stand in front of another game, hoping no one else wants to play it. \n\nThat goes for the bathroom as well--thought it was odd to have a shooting game right in front of the entrance to the bathroom. I almost got elbowed in the face a couple times trying to pee after breaking the seal. \n\nAlso, I thought it was it was weird that they have these taps sitting at their bar with no indication of what it actually is. The only way I found their selection was to go through their menu...which just seems to slow things down a bit much (and I imagine might be increasingly difficult if you're drunk). \n\nThe quality of the games for the most part were fine. I do miss, as another Yelper mentioned, the sound aspect. I played and beat the Michael Jackson game, but sadly, all I could hear was a trademark \"YEEHEE!\" everytime I entered more quarters. Some of the games ate my quarters, and also games that had multiplayer only allowed you to play 1 player. Sad days. \n\nAll in all, I'd still give Brewcade another chance; could just need some time to figure things out a bit more. I'd also say adjust your expectations of having a full-fledged arcade experience to one that's more like a casual drinker/gamer hanging out for happy hour and who may or may not be into kinky elf sex.", "author": "Patrick W."}

The owner really knows his stuff about games. \n\nOne piece of constructive criticism - the coin slots are kinda hard to see. I understand getting the coin slot lights working is less important than maintaining the games themselves, but maybe there's an easy way to improve this (paint around the slots, some sort of subtle floor lighting?)\n\nThere's great 70's and 80's music playing on the jukebox.

I will certainly check out this place as it evolves over the next few months but here's the rundown for all of those interested in checking it out. I want to be candid here so expectations are clear.\n\nPros:\n* Nice, big space and plenty of tables and seating\n* Good selection of beer & wine\n* Nice bouncers and bartenders\n\nCons:\n* No hard alcohol which could be considered a Pro too...\n* Quarter machine was out of order so it was a hassle for both customers and bartenders to constantly have to give/receive quarters. Waste of time and money for both parties\n* Only 15 or so cabinets. No pinball for all you pinball enthusiasts.\n* Those 15 cabinets are mostly filled by knock-off cabinets. What I mean by that is 5 or so of the cabinets are PC cabinet emulators that have 50 or so games to choose from. It's nice, in terms of selection, but loses the sense of nostalgia and accomplishment. Nostalgia is what's drawing people here but they fail pretty badly in retaining that sense of nostalgia. There's only a few REAL, authentic cabinets.\n* Cabinets eat quarters like crazy! Fortunately, they were nice enough to refund the ridiculous amount of quarters eaten.\n* Cabinets are squeezed together so there's not a whole lot of room to play. There was much bumping and drink-spilling due to the compact area around the cabinets.\n* Joysticks and buttons are terrible. There will be plenty of frustration from stuck buttons or non-responseive josysticks...\n* Here's the biggest issue with this place - MOST GAMES ARE $.50 A PLAY...I'm not trying to be cheap here but the fact that i have to play 8-bit JOUST or Tetris or Pac-man for $.50 is a bit ridiculous. Again, nostalgia is important in keeping people coming back but having to pay inflated prices for these games, kills that sense of nostalgia even more.\n\nThis has HUGE potential to be a great place and somewhere I would go on the regular. They just need to find a way to stop trying to make money off of their cabinets and increase their opportunity to sell drinks. Full liquor license is inevitably coming so that should help. Cabinets are expensive, but if they can get authentic ones, they'll be better in the long-run.\n\nLike I said earlier, I went Day 1 so there will certainly be some hiccups. I know things will get ironed out so I'm excited to see what comes.", "author": "Tommy P."}

It would be great if they listed their collection online though http://www.brewcadesf.com/our_games does not currently do so. \n\nThe selection includes: i) games with simple mechanics like Bombjack, Joust, Dig Dug, and Frogger; ii) games which have wide appeal like Puzzle Bobble; iii) vertical scrollers like 1942s and Moon Crestas; iv) platformers like Super Mario Bros, the Donkey Kong games, and Willow; v) shoot-em-ups like Metal Slug; vi) many, many beat-em-ups and slash-em-ups on the Neo Geo; vii) soccer games... You get the idea; enthusiasts and non-gamers alike should find something to enjoy.\n\nGiven the choice between arcade games and beer, I'm a dedicated button masher so I can't comment on their selection of cold ones.", "author": "Shane O."}

The beer is great with a wide selection and the location is easy to find and big. They had one of my favorite saisons, saison du pont, which was pretty cool. The arcade games are nostalgic and fun, but what sets this place apart from other arcade bars is the cabinet with multiple arcade games inside. What I mean by this is inside the cabinet is a motherboard that holds multiple ROMs to choose from, with an easy to use selection screen and when I say multiple ROMs, I mean over 500 different games in just one cabinet. 512 to be exact. Their selection ranges from SEGA to NAMCO to CAPCOM to NEO-GEO. HUGE selection. I was oozing with nostalgia when I got to choose from any of my childhood arcade games. If you like classic arcade games, you gotta go to this place. If you like a wide selection of craft, local, and imported European beer, you gotta go to this place. \n\nA few suggestions: I was told that some people have a hard time figuring out how to use this cabinet, which I can understand. It's pretty self explanatory, but my first impression of it I thought it was a street fighter cabinet. I think if they put like a sign that says like over 500 games in one above the cabinet it would be easier to understand what it is. Also, make the instructions on how to use the cabinet more visible. The lighting in the place is dim, and the instructions are right below the screen in very small font. Because this is also a bar I can totally understand people who are a little tipsy to not read or look down at the instructions. Aside form that, it's great.", "author": "Chris G."}

What pushes this review down a star is the unfriendly service. The bartender's disdain of our party was visible (he had the look of a freshly drenched cat) from the moment we sat down, I suppose because we weren't three young hotties, but people who were as classic as some of the arcade games.

Yes, the machines are close together (the more the merrier as far as I'm concerned), yes, sometimes they jam or are out of order, this is normal and what happens when you have tons of amazing old arcade games! \n\n\"Videogame Bob\" has been in the industry for a while and was super helpful anytime we had a question or a machine jam.\n\nMost of the cabinets are modded to play 200+ games including Mario Bros, Donkey Kong, and PacMan!

The atmosphere is good if you like house music over the sounds of the pinball games and arcade games. My beef is that the bartender went out of his way to ignore my friend and I. We were asked what we wanted, and we needed a few more minutes to decide. He helped some other customers who were ready (as expected), but then other newly arriving patrons would step up right next to us and he would help them first (I'd say 10+ people, or 20-25 mins.). It was painfully obvious he was concentrating so much attention on not serving us or looking at us. When he finally begrudgingly asked us what we would like, he took our money too. He served about five other people before bringing back our change (still no beer). My friend finally got his beer. Then the bartender was greeting friends and chatting with some other patrons for another 10+ minutes, before I had to specifically ask where my beer was. I suppose not having our minds made up about what we wanted to drink immediately, offended him to no end. Since he was attempting to give us the worst service ever, I must commend him for a job very well done.", "author": "Jeff J."}

I went for the first time on a Friday night and they even had the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie playing on the big screen, classic! I feel that since classic coin arcade machines are the selling niche for this place, a well stocked change machine is key for it, which this place totally has. Never did i have to worry about the dreaded orange light like from the laundromat. You're not going to be able to enjoy your beer if you have to keep bothering the bartender for more quarters. Second was management of machines. I actually like how there is a staff member who goes around and directs people on beverage placement for the machines. It shows they care about the machines and as a fan of these select classic titles, I want just as much care shown to them. Now granted their selection is limited which I know they get flack for, but they did have some good ones like joust. Felt like they cheated a bit with the emulator arcade shell, but overall I think is a success on this take of a barcade theme as it would be easy to mess up on. Bar setting feels slightly on the trendy side making the bar and gaming area feel separated. I would have liked to see more a design blend where the bar has more an arcade feel to it, but I guess they wouldn't want drunk people trying to put quarters in the keg fridges.
