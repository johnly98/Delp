(China is an enormous country, and, gasp!, they do incorporate elements from other cultures' cuisines, like every other national cuisine on the planet) The place is clean, blindingly fast, with a friendly wait staff. The food is also really delicious.\n\nMy faves: Shanghai tofu (actually a must-have for our entire family every time), avocado rolls, mushu vegetables (and, yes, they use flour tortillas for the mu shu wrappers lol), and Buddha's delight.

We were quite disappointed by the food itself, but the service was friendly and fast, and the ambience was nice. The restaurant is on a quiet little street and is full of beautiful windows and natural light. Our server was attentive and friendly, and brought us tea/water immediately. \n\nThe experience really fell short when it came to the food. We ordered several dishes- lemon chicken, mongolian beef, chow mein, potstickers, and streamed rice. The only dish worth noting was the mongolian beef- beyond that, everything was bland and underwhelming. Even the texture of the beef was somewhat rubbery. The cost for all of these dishes was less than $50, so it is definitely on the cheaper end of the spectrum, which is good, considering how they lacked flavor. \n\nOverall, I would say Eric's is a good place to try if you are looking for something cheap but are willing to sacrifice taste- otherwise, take your business elsewhere.", "author": "Ayushi A."}

OK?\n\nMu Shu Pork came piping hot to the table together with four much too thick pancakes.  But I ignored the pancakes and just ate the Mu Shu with a fork.  It was a nice mix of pork, cabbage, and egg although it was also very sweet.  The chef here has learned that America overall and I in particular have a sweet tooth.  The former head of the Food and Drug Administration, now a Professor in the city at UCSF, considers sugar to be refined poison.  It probably is but if you have to take poison it may be best to take the sweet kind. \n\nWalnut prawns made me think of the never ending attempts by Chinese chefs to make small or maybe medium sized shrimp appear to be immense prawns.   In this case, the shrimp were coated in much too much batter, which after frying were not entirely cooked through.  So the shrimp were OK but they were encased in a somewhat gummy coating.  The walnuts were nice and crisp but I've never fathomed why shrimp on this iconic dish need to be coated in mayonnaise.", "author": "David D."}

It was my absolute favorite Chinese spot up until one day when my boyfriend and I decided to eat inside.

I was so shocked that I didn't even know what to say. I had thought very highly of the restaurant up until then and didn't think they would be careless enough to leave something like that in a rice cooker. I used to work at chipotle and used to clean out the big rice cookers so I chose not to get upset and calmly called the waiter over and showed him what I had found. He looked at me weird then took it from me and said he would ask his crew about it. He came back about 20 minutes away and said my meal would be free.

The waitress brought the  food. We were about to start eating when hell broke loose in  the kitchen. We heard an angry man  shouting at a woman in full voice. She screamed and cried. I asked the waiter and waitress what was  happening, but they stayed away from us, as if afraid of answering. The chaos only stopped when i got up  and threatened to call the police. Only then did the waitress alerted the man in the kitchen to cease. \"I told him to stop,\" she said. We will never again patronize this restaurant.

Although everyone, including Wil,  has been gracious and kind but these two make things perfect. Ben is charming and friendly and always gets my order just right. I say that because we do  make some changes from the typical offerings. He is always smiling and makes us feel like we are home. Esther remembers little things and always tries to make me happy. She is warm and thoughtful. So service is wonderful at Eric's. We eat a variety of things when with family members and fairly repetitive when one or two of us. I say this to show we experience many dishes. We are happy to have found Eric's and will continue going regularly. An additional note is about the bathroom. The bathroom is always clean.

The other night, it was Chinese New Year weekend and I decided that I really did want some good Chinese food for dinner. \n\nIt's a unique Chinese restaurant in that the walls are white, it's got a ton of orchids everywhere and there is zero tacky cliche ethnic decorating. I enjoy being there. \n\nWe had beef and snow peas, pot stickers and honey walnut prawns with white rice. It was delicious, and we felt really good when we left. My only complaint was that they ran out of tea, so no tea...which is pretty funny at a Chinese restaurant.  I guess it was a very busy weekend with it being their holiday and all. The staff  was very nice and attentive although it was packed. There was almost a line out the door for their take out. Again, I think part of that was owed to the holiday. They also have a nice lunch special menu, but their prices are super reasonable to begin with.", "author": "Rachel L."}

We ordered approximately 5 dishes including spicy eggplant chicken, broccoli cashew chicken, broccoli tofu, spicy smoked pork, veggie lo mein, and rock cod in white garlic sauce.  The majority of the dishes were too oily and too salty.  The same sauce was used for all the dishes except the rock cod in white garlic sauce; they isimply added peppers to make the \"spicy\" dishes spicy with their brown sauce, and for that reason all tasted the same.  They poured this sauce on top of the lo mein, too .... Traditional lo mein does not have sauce poured on top of it. The food was just about drowned in this sauce, and all the ingredients were brown because of how much sauce was used, including the broccoli.  The spicy smoked pork was dry and tough. I did enjoy the rock cod in white garlic sauce. The spicy eggplant was good, but again just too salty and oily.  I'd go back if I was in a fix for food, but I would definitely request less sodium and less oil.", "author": "Rosalie L."}

We live a few blocks away, but I honesty didn't start going there regularly until the last 10 or so years. Despite being almost next door, I first heard of the place from a recommendation from someone at my high school in Marin. This was in 2007 or so. A teacher who realized I lived in Noe Valley mentioned that I have to try this place. The teacher lived in Marin, and said she went there every time she was in the area. Soon after, I decided to try Eric's. Long story short, I've ordered almost everything on the menu, I've done both takeout and eating in. The signature secret sauce that they use on almost every dish makes my mouth water even in my sleep just thinking about it. All of the food is incredible, there is no comparison. I've been to Chinatown in SF, and have also tried numerous other Chinese restaurants, but none come close to the excellence of Eric's. My favorite dishes are Eric's Chow Mein (a mix of beef, chicken, pork, noodles, veggies), Mu Shu Pork, Fried Rice, and Great Won Ton Soup. The sauce is the key. It's the key to all their dishes, I must repeat that. The best way to describe the sauce is \"heaven on a spoon\". Aside from the food, the place is clean and well lit, and priced cheap for SF Chinese food. The food portions are nicely large, and you get the same portions whether or not you take it to go or eat there, \n\nI've been to Eric's over 100 times, and the consistency is incredible. 10/10", "author": "Zach S."}

When people mention Eric's, I would think of its rival, Alice, in the same neighborhood. \n\nMenus are in English only. That's tell-tale sign #2 for you. It serves seafood but no fish tank is in sight, sign #3. Chopsticks yes but rice bowl no. Like any Chinese restaurant, menu is huge, divided into beef, pork, poultry, and vegetables. The specials are listed with almost all 26 alphabets. It's clear and straight-forward. You just have to make up your mind.\n\nHalf the restaurant got potstickers, egg rolls, broccoli beef, sweet & sour somethin' and the very famous house special sesame chicken topped with black sesame seeds---or a varied combo of them. Coming here means I have to bend a little bit for the white-meat eating BF.\n\n*Egg Rolls ($4.95): Available vegetarian only, with shredded celery, carrot, cabbage, and mushrooms. Two rolls cut in four pieces. A bit greasy and lacking flavor. \n\n*Walnut Prawns ($10.25): Specials item Q. The walnut prawns here are deep fried in a batter, instead off being dipped quickly in the oil. So it's not the walnut prawns I'm used to, but otherwise very tasty. Served in a \"bird's nest\" with candied walnuts. They give you plenty of prawns, too.\n\n*Lemon Chicken ($8.95): Tender pieces of white meat chicken in a light batter with lemon glaze. Believe it or not, we have this dish in Hong Kong so it's not something invented to cater for Americans' palette. \n\n*Pork Fried Rice ($6.95): Rice is dry (supposedly dry because fried rice should be made with leftover rice) and not greasy. Plenty of egg and diced BBQ pork and tiny shreds of lettuce. It's better than I expected. No soy sauce added thank god!\n\nService was attentive enough for a Chinese restaurant. I'm most impressed that they seated us at the table by the window. They could have put us all the way in the back against the wall since people at the window just got out. They quickly cleaned up and set the table for us. \n\nRestaurant is airy and bright, free of cooking fume.", "author": "Matt Y."}

Scary, huh? Not Eric's. The fact that I've been to 1,475 places since my first visit there. Oy! I need to cook at home more often. If Julia is about eat, pray, and love, my spiritual journey must be eat, Yelp, and eat again. In the meantime, Eric's is like the Secretariat of Chinese restaurants, a thoroughbred that delivers nearly every time at the finish line... as long as Jamie W. and I stick with the items we always order. \n\nI still feel the $5.50 bowl of Wonton Soup is the best in the city because it doesn't have that oily broth you usually experience at other restaurants. The broth is clear and fresh-tasting, and the wontons are well packed with flavor. This time, we went for the $9.50 Hunan Lamb, which is leg of lamb sliced in bite-size pieces with red pepper, garlic and chopped spring onions on top (see photo). Tasty and not too spicy-hot. The other dish is unavoidable for us, the $10.25 Walnut Prawns (see photo), because who can deny mayo and honey slathering deep-fried jumbo prawns and candied walnuts?\n\nI still think they need to drop the taco shell for the original crispy noodle basket. The service is still machine-like, and I really wish they would separate the take-out side of their business from the restaurant because I get tired of people staring at me while I gorge. Stop judging me. And parking seems to be getting more painful in this part of Noe Valley. We just don't have the patience to wait for the J-Muni since the city continues to cut back on service. But Eric's is still worth an occasional tap on your bumper... after all these years. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...signature dishes like the Walnut Prawns deliver...and the best wonton soup in town \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...nice converted Victorian but cordon off the take-out customers, will ya? \nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...machine-like waiters who don't have time for chitchat...or order adjustments \nTOTAL - 4 stars...nice to know some places won't ever change", "author": "Ed U."}

Granted, my living here has never once tempted me indoors (I usually stick to Chinese on Clement or just simple dim sum I pick during window shopping excursions for cheesy stocking stuffers in Chinatown) but tonight was different.  I had just finished my friends art show, had an hour to kill during a viciously cold breezy evening, then it was off to the Cat Club for some dancing-to-the-80's night.\n\nSmall, cozy and warm, we sat by the window which afforded us views of other Noe suburbanites waddling away in their cashmere scarves and Merrell Shoes.  Since it was freezing, we ordered a small portion of their Hot and Sour soup followed closely with their Spicy Eggplant and the pork Mu Shu.\n\n\"Rice?\"\n\nBut of course.  A side of your brown rice please.\n\nI have to say, that every dish was amazing.  The Hot and Sour soup had the right balance and was very savory, with crunchy strips of bamboo and slightly salty pieces of pork.  I may have to request it extra hot for next time since it cooled quickly.  The Spicy Eggplant was sooooooo intense in flavors that I was ladling it right on top of my brown rice, which incidentally, was one of the best bowls of brown rice in my life.  It had a consistent texture and the right amount of \"give\" as I ate away.  The eggplant was not overdone, usually the consequence of this vegetable being simmered.  But in this case it absorbed the flavors of the sauce without sacrificing the texture of the eggplant.  The Mu Shu was perfect and after the crepes were utilized, I continued to pick away at the julienned slices of veggies and tasty bits of pork.\n\nThe beauty of most Noe Valley establishments is that you will inevitably run into someone from the surrounding blocks.  As we consumed our order, several groups of people escaped the cold to take a seat in this little restaurant, smiling and waving as we took turns with salutations.\n\nThe prices here are slightly more than I usually spend at Chinese restaurants, but it is probably warranted because it is Noe and add in the exorbitant and insane prices for rent here, I'm not surprised.  \n\nGreat food and a perfect little corner spot to keep an eye on Noe traffic, wheels and feet.  Parking is a pain, so if you live a few blocks away, a nice walk will whet the appetite for your meal here.", "author": "Miika M."}

If a chef wants to improve on or get creative with a cuisine, then go ahead if it tastes good.  Maybe \"fusion\" is the latest buzz word.  For instance, the appetizer sampler plate ($7.50) had Crab Meat Rangoon (cream cheese and crab in a won ton skin and fried) and that is not a typical Chinese recipe (maybe Burmese?).  Tasted good, though.\n\nAnother atypical thing for a Chinese restaurant...it was CLEAN!  \n\nI wanted to try the large Sizzling Rice Soup ($8) so we could all try it, even though one of our party did not want soup.   Well that changed when she saw it!  It was full of vegetables, seafood, and of course the sizzling rice, so our friend changed her mind and was glad she did.\n\nOur group also ordered Mu-Shu Pork ($8.50), Asparagus Beef ($8.75), Beef with Green Peppers (lunch special...can't remember price), and the Hoisin String Beans ($7.50).\n\nIt was a Friday at lunch time and not particularly busy, the service was good.

And then, the mango complimented the spice to tame it down and give you a zesty flavor. BOOM. ultimate party in my mouth.\n-- Please do yourself the favor of ordering this dish.\n\nEric's Fried Rice is also really good.\nIt's loaded with all types of meat, but they warn you of that in advance.\nIt is hands down my boyf's favorite fried rice in the whole entire world. So, to say it was anything less than perfection would be blasphemy.\n\nDrums of Heaven\nUnique fried chicken.\nThey carry a punch but it is a unique flavor. Their dipping sauces are definitely awesome to try with the drum sticks. The more brown/orange dipping sauce is horse-radish-y, but beware, it's reaaaally potent and makes your eyes water (which I enjoy), but if you're not into that, just use sparingly. The other sauce is some sort of sweet and sour sauce. \nTo be honest, I'm not sure if the sauces even compliment the taste of the drumsticks...but the drumsticks are awesome, the sauces are awesome, and together it's just a real party in your mouth.\n\nCONCLUSION -- I'll definitely be back and I'll be taking my family and friends.

They had several interesting choices on the lunch side so I decided to stick with that. It's not your typical Chinese place, kind of upscale, so a $6 lunch seemed like a great deal.\n\nEverything started fine. We sat down and were given soup and hot tea. One of my friends asked for hot oil, they don't have the condiments on the tables. The soup was a very bland egg drop type thing with lots of tofu and carrots; I didn't like it. After about ten minutes, that is hours in soup time, my friend had to ask for the hot oil again. I tried a bit of oil in the soup but it really didn't improve it much. I tried to eat around the tofu as best I could but left most of it in the bowl.\n\nWhen they took our order I asked what the waiter recommended and he suggested the Hunan fish. One of my friends ordered a chicken broccoli and cashew dish and the other ordered an eggplant and shrimp thing that wasn't on the lunch menu.\n\nFirst they brought out the eggplant dish and then the chicken lunch. My friends were sharing so one took some rice off of the plate and the other one started to eat the chicken when the waiter came and took the plate away. He came back with a brand new one and put it down in front of my friend with the only explanation being \"you order spicy\". I was left sitting there with no food and no plate to put any of the already served food on. I told my friends to please start with out me.\n\nMy friend's chicken was way too salty; we all tried it and agreed. We called the waiter over and tried to explain but he didn't understand so the owner came over and I believe he thought we were complaining that there was too much sauce. We decided to switch to pot stickers instead. Still no Hunan fish!\n\nFinally about 20 minutes after the first dish came out I got my lunch. It was very good but I thought a little soy sauce might make it even better so had to ask for it, they don't have the condiments on the tables.\n\nFinally the pot stickers came out and they were the best I've ever had. We wanted to put vinegar on them so we had to ask for it because they don't have the condiments on the tables!\n\nThe food was good but the service was a catastrophe. My friends that go there a lot say it isn't usually like that so I'll give them another try and they could very well get another star out of me. \n\nOne bit of advice though; ask for all of the condiments as soon as you sit down so you don't have to wait for them later.", "author": "Manny F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-05-06", "description": "A few days ago, I was helping my daughter, Kris A. move to the city.  It was time to eat, so Kris suggested we eat take-out from Eric's.  Kris and her fiance, Aaron have eaten at Eric's when they lived on Cesar Chavez and Sanchez.  See Kris' review below way past my review.   Surprisingly, Kris' review is a complete 180 degrees from my review and I am her Mom!  \n\nThis time, Kris and I ordered won ton soup and four side dishes.  The won ton soup was piping hot that it melted the plastic lid from the styrofoam containers!  The cost of the take-out meal was $35.00.\n\nI must admit I was rudely surprised by the won ton broth because the broth was unusually spicy and lacked the usual ingredients Cantoneese chefs use for won ton soup.  I guess I am hooked since early childhood on Cantoneese cuisine rather than Szechuan.  \n\nI guess I am a wimp, a cry-baby when it comes time to eat spicy foods.  I just cannot seem to tolerate spicy foods which includes Thai, Indian, Mexican and Spanish cuisine.  Anything hot and spicy, I run away everytime!\n\nThe side dishes Kris ordered were alright-a little plain, too spicy, sparse with the ingredients-especially the meat, but here again, the side dishes did not satisfy my mild, Cantoneese palate. Nevertheless and despite my review of Eric's, the restaurant was jam-packed full of Eric's cuisine afficianados.  \n\nStrangely, the interior decorum was Asian-Modernesque design, boasting a gargantuan mirror in the center of the restaurant while the front entrance is simply understated, plain, and you could never tell that this place serves Szechuan cuisine or any type of cuisine.  I tried taking a picture of the front entrance of Eric's with my Nokia 6260 video camera phone but, I chose not to post it because the picture was just too oddly plain.  The front door had a graphic picture of a coffee cup . . . this graphic picture struck me as quite odd.  I guess the coffee cup symbolism was surely a juxtapositioning of what type of business operates behind the exterior, but plain facade.  Parking was an issue for me-I had to park a block away, so Kris can order our take-out meal. \n\nI know I am not an Eric's fan due to not liking spicy foods in the first place and second, I was never a fan of Szechuan cuisine, but that's okay . . . Eric's is fully packed full of Szechuan afficianados, Eric's will not suffer from my review.\n\nI guess I will return eating at the Far Eastern Restaurant on Grant Street.  Maybe afterwards, continue strolling down to my favorite place to snack when I do not feel like eating a formal dinner at the Far Eastern Restaurant . . . eating my dim sum from the Far Eastern Bakery on Grant and Commerical Street, shopping at all the stores on Grant Street and beyond the alleys.  \n\nHo-hum . . .maybe I'll eat an exotic, seafood Wor Won Ton Soup later for dinner at this restaurant on Washington and Stockton-the right side of the street from the corner. . . oh, I do not remember the name of the restaurant, but it is the traditional, old-style Cantoneese cuisine I grew to love.  I have eaten here so many times with my father since I was a child and before he past away in 2001.  I see all the old people I recognize since I was a child eat here at this restaurant and I know why . . . maybe they do not like spicy foods like me, too.", "author": "Shirley M. J."}

They're in my hood plus a club I'm in meets there Thursdays as a group.  I cant imagine eating anywhere else with such frequency. They are definitely \"cuisine\" - not chow, like Sam Wo's - and with an inventive-yet-steady Chinese-California format.\n\nIf you have dietary restrictions, ASK and be specific...they can do you well if you're heart-healthy or gluten free, for instance, but there's not going to be lots of choice there. Go to Millenium or Greens or Ananda Fuara if that's your deal. But, while you're not going to find it a 5star place for vegans, you can still get yourself a Vegetarian meal (if you're Reform but not if you're Orthodox). \n\nAtkins or other low-carb? No. \n\nOn the other hand everything they serve is yummy and you won't feel awful -or hungry- two hours later. \n\nThe dining room is small and loud and crowded and clean and lovely. They do a brisk business but theres not usually a wait - and if there is its never long. \n\nThe service can be terse but they're quite friendly if you're minimally civil (they're awfully nice to my more difficult friends, though difficult friends tend to remain so). They recognize repeat customers and generally seem to love their service work. So tip them well as you can; theyre not going to get rich there and they are lively folks. Besides, it's the customers that make a good place stay good. \n\nThis is a great neighborhood place - one if the reasons that SF is such a desirable place to live. \n\nI allot 15 for my solo entree after tip; 20 if I have a potsticker or \"carb rangoon\" appetizer...both of which never get old. Actually, an order if potstickers is more than enough meal for a solo eater - allot 10$ for that, incl tip.", "author": "Steve F."}

Generally, i felt that while I never cared for Eric's, it served a purpose as a place for cheap Chinese Food that is aimed at an American palate.  Nothing wrong with that as Dragonwell in the Marina does the same thing, but much better.\n\nHowever, we recently ordered takeout from Eric's and it was absolutely terrible.  The food was greasy,salty, stringy, and the ingredients tasted cheap. We ordered the food mostly for my nieces and nephews as they love Dragonwell, but Eric's was a poor substitute.  Our dishes are below:\n\n* Beef with Broccolli - salty and greasy.  The broccoili was overcooked and stringy.\n\n* Chicken and Aspagarus - the chicken looked like cat food and was almost unrecognizable as meat of any kind.  Again the sauce was a greasy mess of soy sauce, cornstarch, and juices.\n\n* Garlic Shrimp - The worst dish.  The shrimp was mealy and a low grade of seafood reserved for the worst buffets.  Too much garlic and combined with mushrooms, which was an awful pairing. Again, they used the same disgusting sauce for the Beef, chicken, and Shrimp dishes.\n\n* Potstickers - decent potstickers and by far the best dish.\n\nI have eaten at Eric 3x-4x in my 10 years in Noe and over time the food has gotten worse and worse, while its popularity seems to increase.  I still feel sick from greasy salty sauce on every dish,even several hours after the meal.\n\nEric's is like a bad Reality TV show - It's terrible and getting worse over time, yet still popular for reasons beyond conventional logic and taste.", "author": "Zk K."}

There were too many restaurants almost as good with a 90-100 score sans the mouse poop.\n\nBut we couldn't stay away forever.  Eric's SFScore gradually increased  and the General's Chicken and the potato pancakes beckoned. \n\nWhile I can't vouch for the authenticity of the food, it sure is yummy. We started of course with Eric's pancakes, dressed with a peanuty garnish that tasted much better than it looked. Next came the Rainbow Fish, a colorful concoction of diced cod swimming in a sea of red, green and yellow sweet peppers and drenched in a flavorful garlic broth. And finally, instead of the General's Chicken, we opted for the slightly more healthy Sesame Chicken sitting on a bed of zuchini and carrots with the occasional celery stick. It did not disappoint. If anything was weak it was the brown rice, which clumped together a little to easily as if it had been in the cooker way too long.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy we gave it a try. I'd be happier still if they posted their SFScore in a more prominent location (like the window) and had more frequent inspections (the last one was mid 2009)... but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.

In fact, we had Mango Prawns, Kung Pao Chicken, and Buddha's Delight and Sunshine complained that they all tasted the same, because they were cooked in the same brown sauce.", "author": "Elaine B."}

There could be good wait during early dinner rush but they are generally efficient. \nMost servers are very polite and attentive, BUT there're some who should not be dealing with customers at all, like this one guy who- \n1) yells 'WHAT' from across the hall when you want something and signal to him, \n2) tells you 'rice is free,  no problem' when you ask for another serving as if it's a big deal to pay for freakin bowl of rice, \n3) tell us \"we close shortly\" while you're eating and then just stands there....\"when you ask what would you like us to do? and jokingly say we'll eat faster\"...then clears it up that he wants us to pay early....which we do. Brings the receipt and at 9:20pm (10 mins BEFORE closing) then gestures from across the room to sign it! At this point I had to tell him to not rush us or be rude and let us eat!! Thankfully other servers saw this and came to our rescue, they were apologetic and very attentive.\n4) he then continues to sing loudly, stretching his body as if he's in his living room, trying to show with attitude that he doesn't care about his incompetence \n\nThat one rude guy definitely needs better training or should not be dealing with customers in the dining room!", "author": "A K."}

My husband and I are San Francisco natives that have moved away so it was nice to go back to one of our old restaurants and see that they are doing well and the menu has not changed since they first opened. We were customers 24 years ago when they were new to the neighborhood now they are a go to place if you want great Chinese food. We will try to go back more frequently.

One roomie has a tree nut allergy, so we had to avoid the Shanghai chicken (has nuts) and the walnut prawns - the waiter was nice about verifying that our other items didn't have nuts (and he made it through the meal safely).\n\nWe ordered...\n- Hot and Sour Soup - Delicious. Both hot and sour. Really hit the spot on a cool night.\n- Mu Shu Pork - The waiter wrapped these for us, which was kind of nice. But, they put way too much oyster sauce in there, which made the whole wrap overly salty. I had to drip a bunch of sauce out, which made it taste better. One roommate ended up unwrapping it and just eating the filling.\n- Garlic Shrimp - Pretty good, it was in some kind of dark brown sauce that was quite salty. Lots of whole garlic cloves were included that were really tasty.\n- Some Eggplant Stir Fry - Probably my least favorite dish, because it was the saltiest. It was also almost exactly the same as the garlic shrimp dish (same sauce), and also included shrimp, so we felt like we were eating pretty much the same thing again.\n- String Bean w/ Fried Tofu - Liked this dish. Not overly salted, green beans were crispy.\n\nOverall, no MSG, which is good. However, I got a stomachache later that night, which happens to me when I've eaten something too oily. Saltiness was also through the roof on most dishes.\n\nWould consider going back the next time I crave hot and sour soup, but I'll try some different entrees next time and perhaps ask if they can reduce the amount of salt in the dishes.", "author": "Erin Y."}

Either my taste has changed, or they've fallen a fair ways.  There seems to be a focus on turning tables to the point where it feels like you're just quickly grabbing food at a Panda Express in a mall.  Worse still is that just like the Panda Express, every dish at Eric's seems to be a variation on a handful of different sauces.  We recently ordered \"Eric's Tiger Prawns\" and Broccoli with Jade Tofu and were surprised to discover near identical corn-starch thickened, light brown garlicky sauces.  Hey, no problem, but it would have been nice if the menu (or the waiter for that matter) had clued us in.  Both dishes were passable, but ultimately bland, bland, bland.  They had a little chile marker on the menu next to the shrimp dish, but I didn't taste any heat.\n\nI think the key at Eric's is to accept that they excel at those very same dishes you might order at a Panda Express.

Usually you get very little protein in this dish and have to ask for extra shrimp. However, they are very generous with the number of shrimp, and the sauce was about as delicious as it gets. I really enjoyed the appetizers as well. Definitely a spot I will try again.", "author": "Bradley V."}

We picked up our food, came home, and then opened it up to find that instead of our lemon chicken, we got some sort of fried bean thing. This isn't a problem I thought, I'll just call them up.\n\nThe girl was very nice on the phone, and said to come on down and we will give you your lemon chicken. So we got in the car and swung back into Noe Valley to get our tasty erics. But what happens next is a bit of a shock to me.\n\nWhen we got there, I talked to the girl, she went into the back to talk to the main chef/owner (obvious person in charge). The girl comes back to me and says, \"Did you bring the bean dish with you?\"\n\n\"Uhhh, no,\" I said. I was pretty confused at this point. \"Why would I want to bring back the food, it could be contaminated at this point.\" \n\nI looked back at the head chef/owner and we made eye contact, he then put his hands up basically making it clear that \"I don't get free chicken.\" I then put my hands up in the air mimicking him asking aloud in the restaurant why I should be bringing back \"contaminated\" food.\n\nThen it dawns on me.... there are 2 POSSIBLE ASSUMPTIONS FOR THIS SITUATION:\n\n1) I am a liar and/or thief trying to get some free lemon chicken out of the deal (I can assure you the 15 min ride, and double parking on church isn't worth trying to rip them off of a 8 dollar dish)\n\n2) They were planning on putting the bean dish back into \"the pot\" assuming I didn't touch it.\n\nBoth of these are pretty gross and or insulting. Having worked in the food industry as a waiter when I was younger, we NEVER EVER EVER took back food. If someone came back saying the order was wrong, you just give them another order. There are to many complications with contamination to even bother. And customer's shouldn't need to present \"proof.\" And if they do, then you throw it away. Given the shiesty-ness of this situation, I can only wonder if it was every going to get thrown away. Long story short, I left bitterly. \n\nWell it's been a good run Eric's.

Cook knows what he's doing, which is cooking for non-Chinese people with dead tastebuds. Food uniformly salty as seawater and sugary as Apple Jacks, due to the heavy use of corn syrup. Eric's is 1 star for me, but they've survived this long in the neighborhood, so somebody likes them. And that college teacher who gave a 1 star rating because the waiter pointed out that there's an $8 minimum per table? That was seriously unfair because you are penalizing them for enforcing a published policy. You should have gotten take-out. It's not as if they changed the rules on ya. Restaurant's got to make money, and can't have ppl like you acculturated to taking up valuable table space for one hot and sour soup for your  kid. It's not worth the waiter or restaurant's clean up and table set up cost for a $6 charge. Restaurant owners consider \"good riddance\" to customers like you (and critics like me).", "author": "Ichor B."}

How about fresh, tasty, and vibrant looking vegetables with just the right amount of \"al dente?\"\n\nIf you said yes to the above, you'll love Eric's.. Yeah.. I know, its not even a Chinese name. Go figure. My favorite chinese restaurant is called ERICS! lol.  \n\nErics is a little place tucked away on beautiful Church Street in Noe Valley. I like it because its unassuming but nice enough to have small group parties and impromptu lunches (It's like shopping at a little neighborhood boutique rather than a department store)\n\nhttp://erics.ypguides.net/\n\nA mixture of Hunan and Mandarin Chinese Cuisine, the food here is \"clean\"-- never overly cooked, never overly sauced, never greasy. I love eating chinese food where I'm not OVERWHELMED and ASSAULTED by the sauces, spices or oils. At Eric's I'm pleasantly surprised by the taste of the meats, or the vegetables, \"accented\" by the spices and sauces. That's how cooking should be!\n\nI'm always suspicious of places that overly sauce. What are they hiding? And why can't I taste anything else BUT the sauce? YIKES!\n\nMy favorite dishes at Eric's is the Sesame Chicken, the Walnut Prawns, the Garlic Eggplant, the Hunan Fish and House Fried Rice. Each are presented tastefully on white plates. And if your vegetarian, do not dismay, they have alot of dishes for you as well.\n\nI can't find anything wrong with this place, and wished more places EDITED when cooking. It's not a fancy place, although you'll find people dressed business casual, to just casual. But it's also not a dive. Tables are draped in white cloth with votive candles, for that bistro feel... The large picturesque windows give you a view of one of my favorite neighborhoods in San Francisco. And if you've ever entered this place from a wintery rainy evening; it sets a beautiful mood as your enjoying your hot & sour soup, while looking out at the wet and rainy streets.\n\nEric's is just a great place to have a nice \"fresh and clean\" tasting meal. I'd recommend Erics' to everyone. Because there aren't many tables, you won't be at a loss for table service either. \n\nBut seriously come here for the food. I love it! (If their tables are full and there's a wait.. walk on over to Alice's (Sanchez Street) just around the corner, and at the tail end of Valley Street behind the Church... It's owned by Eric's as well.)\n\n4.5 Woofs... the food here is GREAT!", "author": "J\u00f6HnNy A."}

The decor inside is simple & very pleasing to the eye. It's clean, bright, a has few \"Asian\" decorating touches. We were acknowledged as soon as we walked in even though they were pretty busy. Service deserves 5 stars- we had three waiters taking care of us, which means our water glasses never ran empty, our food was brought out quickly & we were asked several times how our meal was coming along. The waiters here are attentive. \n\nChopstick worthy:\nWe started with the appetizer combo: the potstickers & chicken \"drums of heaven\" were awesome. The potstickers tastes like the ones I grew up eating & the chicken, what little meat was on them, was nicely marinated in a divine sweet & spicy sauce. Their small wonton soup was a large enough portion for two people, the snow peas & carrots were still crispy, & the won tons were really delicious. I think it was the best thing I ate last night.\n\nTheir fried rice was as white as their walls; I'm used to it being brown from the soy sauce, so it definitely lacked that good fried rice flavor I was looking forward to. Okay, I'm ready to talk about the mu shu pork... it was delicious- i love their hoisin sauce & the pork was very lean, but why, in the name of all that is delicious, did they serve it up with TORTILLAS instead of thin rice paper pancakes??? I was so disappointed! I know they are trying to appeal to a large, non Asian clientele, but mu shu comes with those rice paper pancakes & I can't settle for anything different. The other thing we ordered was orange beef- the good news was that it was a huge portion. The bad news is that, even though it was decent tasting, it was not special/flavorful enough to rave about.\n\nThe bf & I ate here a few years ago with some friends & the meal was not very memorable. If it weren't for YELP allowing me to document our latest dining experience here, I'm sure three years from now I would not remember what I ate & if it was even any good. The bf & I agreed we would come back to try other things on their menu to see if anything else holds our attention, but we also agreed that PF Changs in Palo Alto is the best place for \"white-afied\" Chinese food.\n\nTonight's bill: $42 (before tip.)", "author": "Fancypants X."}

Who knows?\n\nWe were were headed for Alice's but the reviews were terrible. I was a little shocked as the food was always very good. In fact, 3 reviewers complained of getting food poisoning at Alice's. So we opted for Eric's instead.\n\nWe ordered Mishu Pork, Hoison Dry Beans, Crab Rangoon, Broccoli Beef and rice. The Mishu Pork was salty, greasy and tasteless. In fact, I found a shrimp in it. The beans were full of sauce, greasy and a little mushy. The Broccoli Beef had too much sauce and was tasteless. But the Crab Rangoon was perfect - just the way I remembered it.\n\nI really can't believe all the good reviews for Eric's. Yes. It once was a great place for reasonably priced, fresh and tasty Chinese food but not anymore.

However, I hate American-Chinese food -- especially when it's full-service restaurant-style. The only time when I will accept American-Chinese food is when it's fast food and I'm paying $6.00 for my combination bowl with Orange Chicken. All the people who are saying that this is \"authentic\" Chinese food are most certainly not of Chinese-decent. Sure they may have authentic Chinese-named dishes, but the taste is definitely not authentic. Still, though, there are American-Chinese restaurants that really do serve great food -- Eric's is not one of them.\n\nThe string beans with bean curd was horrible -- dry, tasteless, tough. The Ocean's Delight was mediocre at best (the crispy noodle nest that it comes in was insanely stale). The Eric's bread (which is basically green onion pancake topped with peanut sauce) was decent, but it was definitely concocted for an American tongue -- you will never find such a combination in China. The spicy chicken with basil was not spicy whatsoever (throwing jalapenos into a wok is NOT Chinese spice). Even the white rice was mushy and overcooked. How the hell does a Chinese restaurant not know how to make a decent pot of white rice?!\n\nThe service was good for a Chinese restaurant and they served wine, which is always a plus. It's also very clean, which may be a plus for most people, but I like my Chinese restaurants dirty and delicious.\n\nAll in all, Eric's just isn't a good Chinese restaurant. I guess maybe if you lived in Noe Valley and you were too lazy to drive to Irving, Richmond, or Chinatown, then I could see this is being a temporary Chinese food fix.

Not only is that really boring, it's kind of gross.  While Eric's is definitely guilty of this in some cases, there are a few things on the menu that are really tasty, very fresh, and wholly satisfying.  I usually am pleased with at least one or two parts of the meal, even if the whole picture isn't a home run.\n\nThings to enjoy, even if you're not that into Chinese food:  The vegetarian mu shu (A+), hot and sour soup (A-), and Eric's Spicy Eggplant (with chicken, shrimp, basil, and spicy sauce... usually an A, though sometimes it sinks to a B).\n\nThings to avoid:  Chow Mein, anything with garlic sauce, the lemon chicken, weekends, the pinot grigio.", "author": "Laura F."}

I suppose take out would avoid the service issues.\n\nBut on Christmas Eve, I was a solitary Jew in search of a quiet, Chinese-ish meal.  I don't have any issues about dining out alone, but apparently the staff at Eric's would prefer I didn't.  When I walked in, I stood at the front for a few minutes with no acknowledgment.  There were not many diners, most of the tables were empty, but several folks were waiting off to the side for their take out.  A couple entered, walked in front of me, and were immediately greeted and sat.  I remained invisible.  I caught a server's attention and the conversation went like this:\n\nMe: \"Hi there:\nHim: \"Can I help you?\"\nMe: \" Um, yeah, I was hoping to get a table\"\nHim: \"what do you want?\"\nMe; \"Well, to eat dinner\"\nHim: \"How many are you?\"\nMe: \"Just me\"\nHim: \"Only you?  One? That's all?\"\n\nHe then asked if I would like to sit at the table in the back, where everyone was waiting for their take out.  Eric's is a pretty small place, and we now were the center of attention.

So what happened afterwards was just downright rude and uncalled for.\n\nWe stepped in and were told to sit at a table against the wall in the corner.  Since the nice window table was open, we asked if we could sit there.  After a little huff, the waiter told us to go ahead and sit down.  Okay, so two people sat at a table for four but whatever if he wanted us to sit at the table for two we would have.\n\nAs we look through the lunch and regular menus, we have some questions.  Two for me and one for my friend.  Simple questions like \"is this stir fried or steamed?\" and \"does this come with...?\" nothing particularly complex or snooty.  The waiter kept interrupting us because people were walking in the door.\n\nThe waiter wanted to seat each person as they came in, making our few questions and subsequent order take forever.  We were getting pissed off at this point because the waiter would just stop us mid-sentence to help someone out.  We got through it and ordered.  Finally.\n\nNext up, we realize we need things like silverware, water, soy sauce and hot sauce.  These were on the other tables but not ours.  Given that our waiter did not seem to have any interest in us whatsoever, we grabbed him and asked for water, silverware, and.... and, he left to get those things, paying no attention to our additional request.\n\nWaiter comes back and we asked for the soy sauce and hot sauce.  He starts to run away to get them.  Then, he stopped, head held high, comes back to the table, points his figure at me and then at my friend and says [sarcasm oozing from each word] \"do you both need anything else?  Anything else at all so I can get you everything at the same time?\".\n\nWe stood up and started out the door.  The waiter asked what we were doing and we told him he was the rudest waiter we had ever met.\n\nSo, if the reviews look good and you think you might go even with my story, please also note what we found afterwards:\n\nThe health department rated them as a 56(!)  \n\nEric's Score:\nhttp://dph-extranet2.sfdph.org:7777/pls/eeop_htmldb/f?p=132:2:7025517705391318::NO::P2_LOCATIONID:2684", "author": "William R."}

Food over vanity. \n\nI had them bring me back something veggie. And they arrived with Asparagus in black bean sauce and veggie mu shu. I also had some of their hot and sour soup, since Eric's gave a gargantuan portion of it. \n\nThe soup was pretty good! Great for a cold night, especially since we've been experiencing record lows. The asparagus was so-so. Nothing special, nothing to write home about. The mu shu was good. But as my dining companions noted, they were skimpy on the wraps. By the way, why is it that every Chinese restaurant is skimpy on the wraps? There's a TON of stuffing, but always like 4 wraps. Am I eating this wrong? Please let me know. \nOverall, good take out food. Really not that greasy at all! And they have BROWN rice!", "author": "Caroline C."}

I explained that I had just called and ordered 4 large soups ($32) and had given my telephone number.  She then responded that 4 large orders was a lot of soup and they had not prepared my order!!!  Due to the commitment I had made to bring the soup to the event, I had no choice but to wait 30 min's for my order to be prepared and was late to the event.  First, $32 is not a lot of money; second, they could have either called back to confirm the order; or third, they  could have just requested my credit card # when I placed my order.

I spied Eric's and remember reading that they had salads so I suggested it and to my surprise my wife agreed. My expectations weren't that high because salads on the menu and brown rice as an option usually equals food for guai los but I have to say I really enjoyed my lunch. The Hunan Lamb was excellent, very tender non-gamey lamb with peppers and leeks I just wish it had been spicier. Mrs. G's prawn salad was also very good and I don't often say that about salad. I spied several vegetarian options on the menu so this place is a posibility with non-meat-eating friends.\n\nService was quick, attentive and friendly. One waiter in particular just doted on my nine month old daughter. I only had one dish, part of my New Year's regime of eating \"lite\" (Lite for me is still enough to feed a family of four normal people) but I look forward to going back and trying more things.

Mostly this is semantic BS to allow me to get my occasional deep-fried-meat-in-syrup fix, but there is a grain of truth to it.  As many other reviewers point out, there's something surprisingly light and fresh about Eric's food, while still satisfying your sinful cravings (case in point: the walnut prawns).  The Shanghai Tofu is also a highlight, as are the masterfully grilled pot stickers. \n\nSadly, I haven't been to Alice's or Eliza's, so I can't contribute to the Nicaean debate regarding the consubstantiality of this Chinese trinity.    But Eric's is pretty decent judged on its own merits.  I like efficient service, but it was a little *too* business-like here.  The decor, by day, looks very dainty and fitting for Noe Valley, but at night they light up the big 'ol neon sign, and the lights inside are a bit too bright and they make the high, unfinished ceiling more noticeable.

The reason I ordered kung-po chicken is that it is a very standard dish with a universal brown sauce that lets me know if this is a good Chinese restaurant or not (my dependable litmus test for Chinese restaurants). It was well cooked, not swimming in sauce but barely spicy at all. What I am saying is that while their food is all right, it is missing a lot of depth (and I do not mean by adding MSG, you xenophobic yuppies). So, I will not be back even though their lunch prices are great. \n \nI eat at Kathy's a lot (right by the French bistro Chouchou) and I find them to have a lot more depth in their flavor. Kathy's describes themselves as California style Chinese cuisine.", "author": "Empress C."}

The beef with broccoli was also really good. It's a simple dish, but I'm surprised at how it's not that great at some places. The beef was cooked well and the broccoli was steamed the proper amount. Not cooked enough or overcooked broccoli is so bad and can ruin an otherwise good beef with broccoli dish. Eric's had it all right, thankfully. I'll definitely be eating here again.

Unlike other places that weigh down random chicken pieces in batter, deep fries and drowns them in an unidentifiable sugary sweet \"oriental sauce\", Eric's uses chicken breast cut into strips, does NOT deep fry or batter them, and combines them with julienned carrots, zucchini and celery in a deliciously savory unidentifiable \"oriental sauce\".   What makes this dish even better is the crushed black sesame seeds they top it off with.  The flavor is much more complex, earthy and warm than the sometimes bitter or bland taste of white sesame.\n\nAs at most Chinese restaurants, Eric's offers lunch specials at bargain prices.  Less crowded during the day, that's a great time to eat in.  Otherwise, I recommend calling ahead and ordering takeout.", "author": "Jenny K."}

(If you are just picking up, either double park and hope the J Church doesn't come, or snag the spot in front of the hydrant and hope the metermaid doesn't come.)  A white box with big windows, and with as many table crowded in as possible.  If dining in, try to get a table up front.\n\nFood.  Excellent ingredients; generous portions; tasty sauces.  For starters, \"Eric's Cakes\" are yummy, somewhat oily scallion pancakes; the potstickers are standard; and the crab meat rangoon is just tasteless unless you count the sweet sauce.  My favorite dishes include the Mongolian Beef, General Tso's Chicken, Eric's Spicy Eggplant, String Beans with Bean Curd, and definitely the Clams with Black Bean Sauce.

I've no doubt that it's popular--packed to capacity at 9:30 PM on a Sunday night! That's swell. But for me, food, service, and ambiance were all wrong. To start, despite a reservation we waited for 15 minutes to sit down. I don't usually complain about this, since I understand that it's hard to measure how frequently a table turns, and you can't exactly ask customers to leave. But they weren't exactly polite or apologetic about it, and that kind of disappointed me. So there's my first ::sigh:: Then we sat down and after a while they took our order in a not-at-all friendly kind of a way. That's ::sigh:: number two. When the sizzling rice soup came, I was delighted by how it looked. The rice was sizzling in just the right way, the snow peas and carrots looked vibrant...but it tasted...not cooked. It just tasted like someone rushed through a soup to heat it up to burning hot, without really making any of the vegetables tender. Another ::sigh:: As the kicker, each dish we ordered (eggplant with spicy sauce, Ocean Garden, General Tso's chicken, mango prawns) had something wrong. Too much sauce, not enough taste, rubbery shrimp, chicken too cooked...I dunno, it was just all very disappointing. \n\nI am sad, sad. I used to think that Eric's was a good restaurant, but now I need to have another really great experience there for me to change the way I feel about it.

At Eric's I am turned off by how easily I drink the juice.  On a list of restaurant choices it almost automatically gets a bye to the final round to battle some worthy challenger.  The Sesame Beef is meth to me.  I have been to Eric's several times, including visits with friends who are vegetarian or don't like spicy food, the bastards, and have never had a bad meal.  For sure the food is consistently a nice step above average.  Yet every time it wins I end up leaving feeling like I just cycled away from manic as somehow the overall experience never meets the expectations.\n\nMy most recent visit covers the full range.  Let's start with the service which was either smarmy friendly, in that unwinked nod to the fact that this is *Eric's*, or rough and rushed.  But also entirely competent.  Our Crab Rangoon came out crazy fast yet while tasty the wontons had that 'fresh out of the microwave chewy albeit recently fried' thing going.  They were a bit greasy but nothing like the veggie eggrolls.  And for both apps they brought only one small saucer each of hot mustard and sweet and sour sauce.   I understand conserving space on the table and we can always ask for more but that just doesn't cut it.  Use bigger bowls if need be.  We also ordered Garlic Eggplant, Family Style Tofu, and Scallops and Broccoli with Szechuan Sauce.  The eggplant was excellent both in flavor and quality with large pieces of eggplant.  I love eggplant!  The tofu was very tasty and cooked perfectly with a lightly crisped exterior and warm and juicy interior.  But while the sauce for the scallops was good there was just way too much of it.  Imagine broccoli fully loaded with and dripping sauce.  The scallops themselves were of at best average quality and in general the dish had more of a broccoli with scallops feel to it than vice versa.\n\nyelp needs half stars because this really is a 3.5 star place.", "author": "Jay W."}

Even-though (or perhaps because) their menu hasn't changed in that amount of time they are consistantly good.  Some of their standard chinese fare (the stuff you can find in most other restaurants) are not bad but not stellar.  What they do best is their special dishes such as the Shanghai Chicken (with Pine Nuts and Toasted Seaweed), the Seseme Beef and the Eric's Spicy Chicken.  Their Hosin String Beans are a family standby as is the Spicy Broccoli.  Their food takes out very well, which is why my wife and I usually get take out, but their dining environment is also perfectly acceptable.  It's comfortable if not particularly big, service is always polite and prompt and not too terribly noisy.  If you are going to eat there, be prepared for difficult parking and on the weekends and on holidays the line for a table can be brutal.  All in all, it's consistantly one of the best Chinese Resturants I have been to in San Francisco.\n\nAs a side note, I consider myself a connoisseur of Pot Stickers.

The green onion pancakes are crispy and greasless with a wonderful peanut sauce that not too peanuty and not too thick or runny for that matter.  The appetizer sampler has rangoons which are crispy and greasless won tons filled with a well balanced crab meat and cream cheese mixture, egg rolls with wonderful vegetarian filling, crispy drums of heaven (chicken wings,) and wonderful fried prawns.  The Eric's chow mein is excellent with succulent prawns, tender barbecued pork, chicken, beef, and vegetables with soft noodles that are not too oily and wonderfully seasoned.  The hunan lemon prawns are the only true disappointment thus far as you can expect a mild lemon sauce like with lemon chicken.  The sesame beef is tender and crispy, flash fried in a spicy Szechwan sauce perfect over rice.  The orange beef is crispy and flash fried with chilies and orange rinds in a light orange flavored sauce; a wonderful spicy number.  The Shanghai chicken is tender diced chicken with seaweed and pine nuts in a light sauce.  The steamed rice is firm and not soggy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-10-06", "description": "on a wednesday afternoon, three of us went to Eric's because we had heard how clean and fresh Eric's was.  however,  their practice of setting up tables with teacups rim-down on the bare table was a turn-off.  people put purses, small packages or other items which often have been sitting on a floor, public restroom sink or floor,  or other germy surface, such as a MUNI seat, on the table.   it is not appetizing and unsafe to drink from a teacup where the rim has been sitting on  an unsanitary surface.  people can have diseases like hepatitis, TB,  flu or cold germs, etc., and not know it, but \"germ up\" the table surface.   some people don't wash hands after using the bathroom and then put those hands on the table.  the restaurant doesn't sanitize the table after customers leave; they  wipe it with a wet rag that they carry around.  you can pick up an illness drinking from a cup sitting rim-down on  such a  surface.\n\n one of us was a tofu lover, ordered a common tofu dish, but even she couldn't stand to eat it.  after one bite none of us would even touch it, it was so very salty and strangely horrible.  fried appetizer chicken wing drumettes, while burned a little on the outside, were actually bloody within. the rest of the food was okay.  we gave no clue as to any displeasure and tipped the  unsmiling, not friendly young waiter $10 on a bill of 45.   we had a very simple order, didn't really require anything much of the waiter.  he didn't  acknowledge the tip, say thank you when we paid the bill or anything at all.  The place was almost empty when we left.  The waiter saw us leaving, but ignored us.  No \"goodbye,\" \"come again,\"  \"thank you\" or anything.  We usually say something complimentary when we are leaving, but in this case all we would have had to say was \"thank you\" and \"goodbye.\"  Since he made no effort to even acknowledge us, we left silently.  The owner or manager should brief the wait staff on simple common courtesy.", "author": "jean w."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-10-21", "description": "I'm so surprised they have fairly decent ratings!!  Their lemon chicken was dry, too hard and chewy, and mostly dough and not chicken. We got another specialty dish of theirs that was drowning in salty \"brown sauce.\" Looking at the other dishes people were eating, they looked very unappetizing and similarly discolored brown with the same sauce. We were very disappointed as we had heard great things about Eric's (from a friend who is from the midwest, and does not eat Chinese food often...should have known)! If you want westernized, MSG-laden food, come here. If you want real Chinese food, you're going to have to go elsewhere!", "author": "E M."}

I've been here a bunch of times and usually like what I get, although many of the dishes are salty (which I guess is typical of Chinese food). The wonton soup is good but on the spicy side- not a good substitute for mom's chicken noodle when you're sick! The only thing I haven't liked is the rainbow fish (sauteed diced rock cod with bell pepper & pine nut in white garlic sauce). The sauce was goopy and there weren't very many pine nuts. The decor is very trendy with lots of orchids, but beware that it gets very loud (even thought they don't play music).", "author": "Laura B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-23", "description": "My friend F recommended Eric's Restaurant, a Chinese restaurant in Noe valley. I like Chinese food, but I don't love it. I do love dim sum, kind of dislike take out type, and regular is just fine. This was a regular food type place. I had Eric's spicy eggplant dish, which has chicken and shrimp. I didn't used to like shrimp, but I do now. There was a lot of shrimp in the dish, and they were nice and plump, but hardly any chicken. The eggplant ( I LOVE eggplant) was really good, but there was too much sauce, and by the end of the meal, everything was a bit drowned in the thick sauce. F and R got the spicy chicken dishes, which they liked, and J got the mango chicken dish, which he thought was good, but not great. Overall, this was one of the best Chinese food places I've been to in a long while. Nothing was friedy, the service was good, and the dcor was nice. I'd probably go someplace else before I went to Chinese, but if I were, I'd go here.", "author": "Merredith L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-15", "description": "Wow, huge disappointment.\nI went there with three other people today and this is how it went-\n      First, we went in and were asked to sit at a table for four in the very back, right next to the loud kitchen, and bathroom.( Note that it really was not crowded and there were other tables open) So, we asked if we could be seated at the table next to the window, since the people sitting there had just left. After some serious eye rolling, sourpuss faces, and looks as though they were being asked to do harsh labor, we were seated at the table next to the window. When my friend apologized about the HUGE inconvenience, I mean please, (even though we told her not to), and the waiter just bunched up his eyes and gave us a whine. \n      Then the waiter came over and asked us if we were ready to order after we had been seated just five minutes before. Lucky for him we were ready to order. When we said we were, he said, ''oops, i forgot my pen.''\n      Okay now i just found this part the most just down right rude of them all. The waiter gave us the assorted vegetable soup. After we were done, most of us didn't eat ours, the table thought that the broth was barley warm, and the vegetables were over cooked, and it had the most disgusting looking color, it was brown with little shreds of orange in it. Okay so the waiter starts clearing our bowls, and he says, ''well it didn't look like you liked it that much.'' in a really rude way. We just didn't know what to say it was just the rudest comment.\n      One of us had ordered Eric's Cake's, so the waiter put it on the table, and passed out four plates for us to eat it. We had already stacked up the plates when we were done, but when the waiter came to collect the plates, he carefully looked at each one in the stack. It was really weird, and we don't know why he did that, but based on what happened before, he could have been checking to see if we had all tried it, but we will never know.\n       When the check came we were all fed up about the service that we left a two dollar tip.\n       As far as the food goes, I had the lemon chicken, which was fine, but I haven't had their food for a while-I think, and I feel like it has gone so downhill since I used to go there.\n       If this review were based just on service, I would give them one star, but since the food was OK, I'll throw them another star.\n       If you are in the mood for some disrespectful, and rude service, then this is the place for you! Personally I enjoy friendly, polite service, which you will definitely not find here.\n P.S. does anyone know the city health rating for Eric's now?", "author": "P R."}

Maybe it's because we went for lunch, or maybe because it's been about 8 years later and things have changed, but the food seemed just O.K.  The women serving us all seemed upset at something (it wasn't us) which didn't add to the experience.  Things like dishes tossed on the table and not one smile make you just want to leave...and not return.  The General's Chicken was not at all krispy and pretty blan.  The \"crab meat \" appetizer was terrible and made with that redish/pinkish fake crab meat (and something that tasted of mayonaise)...ewwww!  The spring rolls had fresh vegetables that weren't over cooked, however, they still weren't all that great.  I was hoping to like this place as it's close to where I live, but I think if I do go again it will be for dinner and see if that can restore my faith in this restaurant.", "author": "Sean M."}
