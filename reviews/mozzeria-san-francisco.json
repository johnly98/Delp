The restaurant is located on a wider, quieter street so it was very easy to find parking and although we had reservations, it looks like we wouldn't have had much of a wait without one. \n\nWe ordered the bolded menu items (favorite dishes) which was a Burrata appetizer and the margarita pizza. Both were very rich in flavor and delicious. After living in Italy for a few months, it feels difficult to find a quality Italian restaurant. The customer service was wonderful and the food came out quickly. All the waiters were speaking in ASL which was a very new experience for me in a restaurant setting, but it was very easy to communicate. It made me wish I knew ASL.

The pizza selections were creative and delicious, and the crust dipping sauce was a fun addition. My biggest complaint is that there just wasn't enough of the delicious toppings on the pizzas. With that said, still amazing and gourmet. Moving onto the desserts, we made the mistake of sharing the Bombolino. Only a mistake because it was so freaking good, that we all wished we had ordered one each. Do not miss out on this dessert, and DO NOT SHARE!!!\n\nAs you can see, we really enjoyed our dinner.

Fluffy crust, lightly charged, flavorful tomato sauce - all the ingredients were stars. My one peeve, and I see this is a lot, is that the sauce and oil made the middle of the pizza a little soggy, so it's really move of a 4.5 star pizza. Three slices were plenty for each of us and I took my last slice to-go. I was a little sad that we had pigged out on CREAM before dinner, so I'm gonna have to come back to try that bomb looking Bombolino.\n\nThe slight communication challenges reminded me of dining in another country. I don't know sign language besides the alphabet, but it was helpful to spell out a couple words.

We were seated pretty quickly. We ordered one Margherita pizza and one Italian Sausage. There was no problems with ordering our meal. The pizza came out quite long, it took nearly about an hour and 15 minutes for our pizzas. I like the Italian Sausage a lot! It was great, but pizza toppings kept falling off. :( The Margherita pizza was yummy, there was so much sauce on it. They have a dessert menu and we ordered the bombolino. It was delicious! Although, it took long to come out as well. It took about another hour for it to come out. I love the apple lemon curd in it! I wish the waiter would check up on us or refill our water.

It seemed like people were into the food here, it was only later that I found out that Mozzeria only hires hearing impaired people. I found that super cool and I wanted to give it a try. \n\nLe bf and I made reservations and went for an early dinner on a weekday. He was the first to arrive. He noticed instantly that it was the quietest restaurant he had ever been too. Lots of the people who were seated were hearing impaired. You could see lots of people signing. I thought it was also pretty cool that people who could speak used the opportunity at Mozzeria to practice their American Sign Language.  \n\nNow onto the food. We ordered:\n1. Veal Meatballs ($11 for 3)\n2. House-made Burrata ($11)\n3. Margherita pizza ($15)\n4. Peking Duck pizza ($20)\n\nThe veal meatballs were my favorite part of the meal. I was forced to share, but if I came alone, I would have no problems scarfing down the meatballs by myself.  The burrata had the texture of chevre. It wasn't what we typically think burrata to be. I prefer burrata texture if I am eating burrata and chevre texture when eating chevre. I have no need to order it again. The margherita pizza was good. Definitely no where close to the best Margherita pizza in the city, but it still tasted good. We got the Peking Duck pizza at the recommendation of our server. I didn't think it was $20 good. The flavor mostly came from the sauce. I was glad I tried it, but wouldn't come back for it. \n\nThey also have Tuesday and Wednesday deals. I think the Tuesday deal is $10 for a Margherita pizza instead of the usual $15. And the Wednesday deal is an app of some kind (I forgot the exact app), Margherita pizza, and Bombolino. I know for sure about the Bombolino, not exactly sure if I got the type of pizza right. It was $25 per person. You can quote me on the price per person.  \n\nThe service was stellar throughout. The servers were super attentive. Communication was never an issue. I thought it was a cool experience, but I don't know if the cool experience trumped the food quality enough where I would come back.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

The unique pizza topping options like peking duck or farm egg pizzas are what set them apart from other wood fired pizza restaurants in the city. I also like their more traditional flavor options like Neapolitan, but the ingredients feel more sparse on these without meat on top. Love the crust - floury, thin, puffed the right amount with just a bit of ashy taste from the oven, but not burnt\n\nLocated in the heart of the mission, this is a great option if Pizzeria Delfina is too packed. Both are great, but I think Delfina provides a bit more value with its toppings.", "author": "Kathy T."}

It's rare to find a place with pizza that I'll actually like (not that I'm a picky eater) since I've had my share of subpar Italian food over the years. My friends and I enjoyed the fact that we needed to communicate to the wait staff without words... though unfortunately I know zero ASL.\n\nWe started with the Burrata and Baby Spinach Salad. Great warm-up to the three pizzas that we shared. We got the Margherita, Italian Sausage, and one more that I can't remember the name of. They were all so fresh and delicious, and the best part was getting the warm dipping sauces for the crust! SO GOOD. Especially the white garlic sauce.\n\nThis place is great for both groups and more intimate evenings. The only part I did not enjoy was the lack of cell service in this building, which is such a minor complaint but maybe worth pointing out?

There were pieces of paper and a pen on our table to help with communication as none of us knew sign language. Though none of us knew ASAL the servers were friendly and we were able to communicate well. We ordered:\n- Veal and pork meatballs (3) $10: it came with freshly made meatballs topped with fresh mozzarella and savory tomato sauce. The meatball was a tad dry, but perfectly paired with the tomato sauce. \n- Margherita pizza $14. I had been highly craving a margherita pizza and could not wait to try their version. The pomodoro sauce was well seasoned and flavorful and the mozzarella cheese was perfectly portioned and melted. Each bit was heavenly! This was by far my favorite pizza. The only downside was the fact that it was a tad too salty for me, but that is an easy fix.\n- Italian sausage pizza $19. This pizza was a friend favorite with their white sauce, Italian sausage and fennel topping. \n\nThe background music was nice so that it wasn't so quiet.

When reading this review keep in mind that I grew up in Napoli (pizza capital of the world) and I take Neapolitan pizza pretty serious.\n\nWe ordered 2 margheritas, which is the classic thing to get.  The dough didn't seem very aerated and wouldn't fold very nicely. As far as the pizza components, they definitely use high quality ingridients.  What I also didn't like much is that each pizza was only four slices, pretty tiny for the price they charge.  \n\nIf I had to rate the pizza alone I'd probably give it 3 stars, however.

It sounded a little like the hold music for AirBnB ;)\n\nIf you've ever read my reviews, you know music is a big deal to me. Tonight the music was quiet, almost too quiet, but much better than the annoying industrial house music they played before. Personally, I like Italian music, especially the soundtrack to the ultimate foodie-film \"Big Night.\" This is a deaf-owned/staffed restaurant, so you can't fault them for what they can't hear. \n\nI wish the server had told us about the Russian River pinot noir wine special, described as \"Stunning, Playful & Pleasing!\" I ordered the nero d'avola-- it was a little bitter, but my friend had the regular pinot by the glass, & it was much better. Mozzeria serves mainly pizza Napolitano style, but tonight I felt like eggplant parmigian with the  spinach salad. The pizza oven is gorgeous, round with round black tiles, definitely prominantly featured in the center of the restaurant. \n\nIt's funny--there was a party of around 20 sitting near us, led by the LOUDEST large woman I have ever encountered. When she spoke, she bellowed, I jumped startled, & then smiled to myself how lucky the servers are to not have to hear that voice. Many of her dining companions were deaf, so maybe she thinks she needs to yell. I have noticed that hearing people often shout at deaf folks. It won't help, lady, & in truth, it's obnoxious. A few little boys stomping around were quite loud, too. If I behaved like that in a restaurant, my mom would have grabbed me by the arm & threaten to banish me to Siberia aka \"the car\"! A fate worse than death to a 6 year-old. Modern parents often don't realize that not everyone finds the antics of their rambunctious spawn as adorable as they apparently do. \nBack to the food-- the eggplant was sublime. Tender, spicy & garnished with fresh basil. I had the appetizer size at $10 & it was perfect, 3 large rounds of aubergine topped with tasty cheese. \n\nI never did get the salad--I think she forgot. But no big deal. The eggplant was very rich & filling enough. Curious about dessert, my pal ordered the bombolino--basically an Italian donut with apple-lemon curd, chocolate, cinnamon & sugar. No dessert wine, but we really didn't need it.\nI would definitely come here again. I hope the owners read these reviews.

Every month or so, I get to choose a nicer place to try with a friend so for this month I decided to we would come here. It started off okay. They seated us really close to the other couple at bar seating which was a bit weird. Normally restaurants would put at least one stool between people. Regardless, it wasn't a big deal. We ended up ordering drinks and the burrata and duck pizza to share. \n\nThe pizza was definitely a great - with duck on top, adding some green onions and hoisin sauce. The amount of duck was not really enough, but it was good enough for the pizza and everything else. \n\nWe ordered some dessert, but it took forever to get. I will admit, I was going to give this place 4 stars, but the dessert situation was just not great. Right after we ordered dessert, there was an accident in the restaurant where they placed a pizza on a table and it accidentally flipped over and spilt on the ground. It created chaos in the restaurant understandably, but it still took almost half an hour to get the dessert. It makes me unhappy since I just wanted to get out of there. This part of it which feels guilty since it wasn't really their fault, but part of me feels like my dessert shouldn't have been forgotten. \n\nRegardless, the food here is good even if the service can be spotty. The deafness of the waiters are not an issue, but I could see where the small problem created a large problem which affected my dinner significantly. Overall, great place and great service.

I ordered the Italian sausage pizza w/ added mushrooms. The toppings themselves were really delicious and the garlic sauce tastes pretty good. However, the very thin base could not hold such a heavy sauce+all the toppings so most of the toppings ended up falling off the pizza itself.

Their pizzas are hand-thrown and baked in the oven - SUPER DELICIOUS. Every person paid about $30 for the whole meal. That price was well worth it for the food you get and how amazing everything looked and tasted. Everyone was quite stuffed at the end. \n\nAmbiance is clean and quiet, but has this peaceful vibe to it. It's a perfect environment if you want to learn more about the ASL culture.

It was founded about four years ago by a deaf couple, Melody and Russ Stein, and in fact, most of the staff is deaf. Jamie W. and I have passed by it before, but I didn't know anything about it until a friend in my yoga flow class told me about it knowing I was always looking for interesting places to eat. Yes, I take yoga, what of it? Anyway, she told me the backstory and highly recommended it. When I got there a bit earlier than Jamie, I immediately started talking when the server looked at me and told her I made a reservation.\n\nShe motioned to me that she didn't understand what I was saying at which point I felt like the Anti-Miracle Worker. I wrote my name down on her clipboard, and she confirmed my reservation with no fuss. Their specialty is a selection of fourteen 12-inch Neapolitan pizzas fired up in their Stefano Ferrrara wood-burning oven which looks to be in constant operation (photo: http://bit.ly/1LpRkfd). Jamie and I were discussing whether we should share one. Who were we kidding? We both ordered our own. He went for the daily special, the $15 Meatball Pizza with pomodoro, grana padano, red onion, meatball, roasted peppers and mozzarella (photo: http://bit.ly/1V3v4Og).\n\nIt had a sturdy thin crust that held all those ingredients with conviction and a puffed, blistered crust that acted almost like appetizers in themselves, In fact, they offer four dipping sauces for $3 each if you need it. I went a bit more exotic with the $20 Peking Duck Pizza, which was a bit wetter with an ample ladle of hoisin sauce along with cucumbers, sesame seed and spring onions on the side to add some crunch (photo: http://bit.ly/1KBamP8). It was a bit out there, but the duck was pretty succulent and the taste was not overwhelmingly sweet. To alleviate our collective conscience, we also ordered the $11 Roasted Vegetable Plate (photo:  http://bit.ly/1OmDnk0).\n\nIt was nice mix of charred Brussels sprouts and cauliflower and peppered with currants for sweetness. No Diet Coke here which bums Jamie out every time, so he had a $3 Boylan Ginger Ale (photo: http://bit.ly/1JiaI82), while I had one of their housemade drinks, the $4 Ginger Iced Tea with Lemon (photo: http://bit.ly/1YpJs2I). Refreshing. All the while, the staff worked quietly and seamlessly, signing to staff back in the kitchen through a monitor at the bar, and some of the customers knew enough ASL to hold conversations with them. I want to learn some fundamental signs the next time I visit, so I don't come across as the Anti-Miracle Worker again. A most worthwhile in the Mission.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...well-executed thin-crust pizzas with a variety of toppings\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...simple, modern space with ample seating\nSERVICE - 4.5 stars...efficient and kind, especially to each other, Melody came in and out of the kitchen to make sure everything was running smoothly\nTOTAL - 4 stars...how do you sign 'thank you'?...you put your flat hand to your lips and move it forward and down", "author": "Ed U."}

Then my sister ordered the Italian sausage $19 and she didn't care for the sausage and the white garlic sauce. She thought it was just to over powering. I then ordered the Mushroom pizza $19 and I didn't like it, it was dry with not a lot of flavor.

Is owned by a deaf couple and operated by deaf staff.\n\nFOOD: \n- Mozzeria bar: an upscale mozzerella stick! Yum! Comes as a golden bar (1 should be a good portion for 2-3) with marinara sauce drizzled atop\n- Fantastic pizzas! The dough had a great balance of flavor, give, and char (I don't even like super burnt crust). I appreciated the little touches like making the pizzas into hearts for Valentine's Day :). \n- Margherita di bufala was a classic and my favorite. Just as good as many of the pizzas in Naples. No wonder... they are Vera Napoletana certified (by American Delegation of the Associazione Vera Pizza Napoletana... basically it means you make authentically Italian pizza by flour, etc. regulations), with a beautiful oven from Italy you can watch your pie enter. \n- Peking Duck--though apparently a staple in the UK, I really disliked this. I do love Peking Duck, but this pie was overwhelmingly sweet with the sauce. I didn't think there were enough spring onion sprigs to offset the heaviness. \n- Ginger iced tea with lemon--so refreshing and not too sweet... you'll need it with the heat of the pizza oven\n\nSERVICE:\nServers are friendly and look like they're having fun signing with each other. No need to be conversant in sign language to come here--there are small pieces of paper and pens on the table if you need to communicate somethign unique. With just 4 minutes of prep though, you can be a lot more excited to go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Raa0vBXA8OQ\n\nAMBIANCE:\nWear some light clothing beneath whatever you wear out, as it can grow quite warm in this cozy restaurant where the pizza oven takes up more space than any table. The space is well decorated in a homey style. Music plays softly in the background for the hearing. This was a lovely place to be for a date or with a friend. It is a little tightly packed, as the restaurant is narrow, and with the oven in the middle, basically a shrine to the art of pizza :)", "author": "Helen W."}

I love wood fired pizza, and the crust and taste didn't disappoint.  The crust had that right amount of chew and crispness.  The toppings were a delicious combination, and we enjoyed every bite. We didn't need the crust dipping sauce, but I liked it. My fiance wasn't a fan, but he prefers marina style sauces. \n\nThe meatballs were kind of dry, like people mentioned. I think maybe an egg needs to be added to make them more moist, or serve it with more sauce. The flavour was there, but the dryness made me only want to eat one.\n\nWe split a bottle of the house red, which complimented the pizza and meatballs. We were surprised at how good it was for a house wine, and definitely would order it again.\n\nI will be back, especially as I want to support my community, but the food is the actual reason I will return.

It's a small, hole in the wall restaurant located in a cool Mission neighborhood and by small I mean it's the second smallest restaurant I've been in with maybe seating for 30 tops.\n\nI ordered their spinach salad and house specialty burrata, a kind of mozzarella cheese made a special way.  My wife had their meatballs and spinach salad while my oldest had the salami pizza and mozzaria bar.  Our other table mates ordered the Peking Duck pizza and a Margherita pizza.\n\nThe burrata was pretty good with a nice mild cheesy taste and buttery texture once you got past the mozzarella skin.  However, the gnocco fritos that came with it were wrong and looked more like fried won ton strips then the little pillows I expected.  I'm guessing the oil was too cold but they might have missed adding yeast to the mix and letting it rise.  In any case, it just didn't go with the burrata IMHO.\n\nTheir spinach salad also had problems.  While the ingredients were very fresh and well presented, the lemon vinaigrette had separated and I essentially got pure lemon juice making the salad almost inedible.  This happened to my wife's salad as well.\n\nNow one note. The server hardly ever came over to our table to check on things after our original order.  We had to flag down, literally, someone else to help us with stuff.  They were very helpful.\n\nThe other dishes: meatballs, pizzas and mozzaria bar were all very good.  They know good pizza!  I was impressed with the meatballs which were good and meaty, firm but not hard and cooked in a light marinara sauce.\n\nOverall, it's a decent restaurant which needs a bit of attention to the side dishes like the gnocco fritos and spinach salad.  With both of those, it's a technique issue - knowing that vinaigrette needs blending before use and having the proper oil temperature when making fritos.", "author": "Carl K."}

Reminds me a lot of the Pizza Politana tent at the Ferry Building Farmer's Market during the week.  Pretty solid within the genre of pizza fired to order.  Since the NY-style pizza game is so weak in San Francisco, might as well stick with a style that works.\n\nBurrata: Mild and fresh cheese, you can definitely tell it was made recently by hand.  Served with some tasty fried dough chips whose fattiness helps enhance the natural fattiness of the cheese.  A little bit of balsamic vinegar, basil and heirloom cherry tomatoes to add a tangy contrast.  Perfect for an extra cheese fix in addition to a pizza, but don't forgo a pizza just for this.\n\nSalumi Pizza: About what you'd expect from a quickly fired to order pizza.  The fresh mozzarella is melted, but not gratin\u00e9ed.  Lots of fresh tasting tomato sauce.  A few thin slices on salumi, that do get crispy on their edges.  Pretty doughy crust though, I probably would have preferred the pizza to be thinner with a bigger diameter using the same amount of dough, because who is a fan of crust?\n\nGinger Iced Tea: Refreshing.

The bitterness of the radicchio was drowned out by the funkiness of the Gorgonzola. A touch of gorgo goes a long way. The mozzarella was texturally weird because of excessive dousing of honey. The dough soaked through and was dripping with honey and yhe nuts on the pizza tasted like they were better suited for cereal.\n\nThe reason I'm giving it a 4 is because I probably ordered the wrong thing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-07", "description": "Between lip reading, hand gestures, & writing out how we wanted the bill split, communicating with Mozzeria's deaf or hard of hearing staff was just as simple as communicating with any other person. Our waitress with the gorgeous curls was warm & efficient -- 5 stars for her!!! \n\nWe ordered: \n-- spinach salad: liked the use of unique ingredients such as kabocha squash, pepitas, & pomegranate. Wonderful idea to leave the gorgonzola off to the side for diners to incorporate as much or as little. \n-- charcuterie plate: I can't comment on the hot coppa or prosciutto, as I didn't partake, but I sampled everything else -- sticky medjool dates, toasted hazelnuts, tellegio (a semi hard cheese). If i didn't practice some restraint, I could've easily gorged myself on burrata spread on fried dough all night. \n-- hosui pear: what I enjoyed most was the sharp & pungent brie, to which the pear, balsamic, garlic, & spinach took a backseat. Mouthwatering on paper, but disappointing in reality. \n-- farm egg: perusing the menu while waiting for our table to be ready, my two dining partners & I immediately agreed on this pizza. Yes, it would be amazing with millionaire's bacon, yukon potato, spinach, shallot-brown sugar, & a runny egg, we thought. For me, it was the worst thing we ate; the overwhelming sweet taste & an unidentified flavor (like cinnamon or anise?) overpowered all other flavors. \n-- pomodoro crust dip: a tomato-based sauce with much flavor depth. We kept spooning it onto their chewy, bubbly crust. A great accompaniment. Get this! \n\nMozzeria's crust is on point, so I can be persuaded to return for a different pizza, perhaps one with more classic toppings such as the Margherita or Mushroom. Their eggplant parmigiana also calls to me. Three stars for my first visit with the hope of more deliciousness next time; their pomodoro dip alone deserves a second visit.", "author": "Fancypants X."}

Our server was just wonderful and our dishes exceptional. \n\nWe had: \n* Margherita pizza - chewy crust, great slight tangy sauce, slightly wet - just the way I like it\n* Potato Gnocchi w/ bolognese ragu - the gnocchi's exterior had a slight (very slight!) crunch but it was fluffy and chewy. Bolognese ragu was flavorful and just simply perfect.\n* Panna cotta (vanilla flavored) w/hazelnut and spiced chocolate. I am not a huge fan of panna cotta but we enjoyed this one immensely \n\nWe typically try and dine in on Tuesdays for the Tuesday Special. You choose two small plates, a pizza, a pasta and a Bombolino dessert for only $39. What an incredible deal!

The base of the pizza would get too wet and then made the cheese and toppings slip off. I was hoping the physical location would be different but unfortunately it was not.

But there's no pressure here at this restaurant, and my friend and I quickly resorted to talking and catching up over our meal.

It is surprisingly very easy to communicate with them! \n\nWe came in on a Thursday evening and were seated immediately. We ordered the margherita pizza and the white peach pizza. The margherita was standard, but tasted great because of the wood-burning oven that they use. The crust tasted smokey and added a great flavor to the pizza. The white peach pizza was a super unique combination of ingredients - peach, cherve, cilantro and a balsamic topping. It was great and I definitely recommend it to those looking to try something new. The peach was just the right amount of sweet, and the cheese balanced out the sweetness to provide a delicious taste. \n\nI love this place and will definitely be back again; their salads and other pizzas looked delicious as well so I'm going to need to try them too!

I believe we had made a reservation - as this place is not very large. It's a long, narrow, rectangular shaped joint.\n\nWe were given two tables - across from each other as they did not have a way to accommodate all of us at one table - which was fine.\n\nAs others have noted, the restaurant employs a number of folks who are deaf and/or hearing impaired. A couple of folks in our group knew sign language, so we had someone who could converse in sign language with the wait staff - which was better than just pointing to menu items.\n\nI ordered their Italian sausage pizza, which comes with Italian sausage, fennel bulb, red onion, mozzarella, fennel leaves, and white garlic sauce - and a \"Brew Free or Die IPA\" from 21st Amendment Brewery (San Francisco, CA).\n\nThe IPA came out fairly quickly - we were all taught by one of our group how to say \"thank you\" in sign language so we could sign to our servers. So I signed \"thank you\" for my Ale.\n\nThe pizza came out fairly quickly - and it was oh so delicious! A very thin, crisp crust with fresh, delicious ingredients! I've never had fennel on a pizza before and very much enjoyed it! And the IPA hit the spot. A very balanced IPA - with nice crisp hop notes, and the right balance of citrus and pine, and a nice bitter finish.\n\nService was very good. My only complaint about this place is the temperature. The pizza oven is right there - heating up the place. They had the front door propped open and a couple of fans running - but the place was to warm and on the verge of being overly uncomfortable.", "author": "Neal E."}

Joanna M has been on a pizza scouting mission for months now. She has a knack for scooping pizza hot spots all around the Bay. Ever since she first forwarded me the details on Mozzeria we knew that would have to form a pizza protest strike and head over there and sample their pies.\n\nMozzeria has an interesting background. Owned by a deaf couple, they have one of the few real Neapolitan ovens in San Francisco. If you have ever had the chance to dine at Una Pizza Napoletana and gazed upon their oven, then you would know what I am talking about. It's the center piece of the restaurant and a thing of beauty. These ovens give birth to some of the worlds most tasty pizzas. \n\nThe pizzas are traditional thin crust Italian style. All your favorites are included which makes it difficult trying to decide what to order. There were three of us on this night, so 3 pizzas for 3 people just made sense. We started with one of the specials, asparagus and blue cheese. We were told initially this pizza would have black truffle, but we did not see nor did we taste any. But given that the pizza had blue cheese it was probably best that no truffle was included and the pizza was quite tasty. Next up was the classic Margherita. We went with the mozzarella di buffala for $3 more which was the right call. I loved this pizza, and was my personal favorite of the evening. The clean up hitter of the night was the Pancetta. Another pizza hit! this pizza included a generous amount of carmleized onions. The onions added a hint sweetness which reminded me French onion soup. \n\nThe pizzas are similiar to those you would find at Tony's and Una Pizza Napoletana. The only difference is that the crust is not quite as charred as the other two, but many of you might actually have a preference to this style. I loved it, but probably would give a very slight nod to both Tony's and Una Pizza Napoletana.\n\nWe were a hungry bunch and obviously could not pass on dessert. Two words here, Panna Cotta. This was a real surprise and did not expect to be nearly as good as it was. We ordered a bottle of Conn Creek cabernet and for $40 I thought it was a good value and worked well with our pizza choices. \n\nMy wife, Joanna and I all agreed that Mozzeria is a true winner of a pizzeria and worthy of future pizza protest strikes. The service was spot on perfect and friendly. The servers and hostess were warm and eager to offer helpful suggestions. \n\nMozzeria is located in the heart of the Mission which is one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in San Francisco. It's within easy walking distance of some of the cities best bars and nightlife. Parking can be a pain, but if you time it right and arrive around 6:00, you have a good chance of scoring a metered spot (Free after 6).\n\n4.99 Stars", "author": "Rene C."}

Bring it on - I love finding undiscovered gems like this!\n\nThink plain white walls, minimalist black wood paneling. The only thing about the decor that slightly throws the atmosphere off are the gaudy modern metal lights. There is a nice relaxed pace to this restaurant, helped especially by the fact that it's not packed like just about every other spot on the block (please please keep Mozzeria a secret...) and by the mostly 2-tops and just couple of larger tables in the back. One of the owners herself, who's deaf, served us and she was very sweet. It was fun communicating with her by hand gestures and resorting to her notepad when needed.\n\nThe food was fantastic, but the dessert we ordered was a major fail =(. Still, I'd love to come back and try the butternut squash ravioli and margherita pizza!\n\n* Potato Gnocchi - 4.5 stars\n(pork bolognese ragu / ricotta / roasted fennel. $12)\nThis was fantabulous. You get a huge serving of pork and a deliciously savory ragu, and the gnocchi a fantastic addition. Minus 0.5 stars only because the absolute best gnocchi I've had was at Campton Place Restaurant in Union Sq where the gnocchi had an additional slight crisp, which I have since held to my new standard for 5-star-gnocchi. The cold ricotta was a great neutralizing counter to the intense flavor of the ragu.\n\n* Pizza Special of the night - 4 stars\n(green garlic, housemade sausage, yukon potato, thyme, white garlic sauce. $15)\nOne of the better thin crust pizzas in SF! (Best ever still goes to Una Pizza Napoletana in SOMA) The crust is super, super super thin and very light. Done very well, but the outer crust is a little airy - at Una Pizza I could eat the crust alone it's so delicious. I'm just being picky, I still really liked it. The sausage was a tiny bit disappointing as 1) there wasn't very much of it and 2) it's more ground-up and homogeneous than I thought. I like when italian sausage has a lot of texture, almost like chorizo. There were also only about 5 slices of potato, and they were a bit undercooked. But overall all the flavors + the thin crust worked together really well!\n\n* Hazelnut Panna Cotta - 2 stars\n(hazelnut / biscotti / aged balsamic. $6)\nBig disappointment. Should have gone with the limoncello truffle. I'm a huge fan of panna cotta and was so excitd to see this on the menu; however, this dish was just off in so many ways. The texture was way too stiff, it was almost like cheap jello. The balsamic flavor was completely overpowering, and the crumbles on top way too sweet. It was really hard to get a right balance of the two flavors in a bite. The biscotti was stale, ie. soft and not nice and crisp as it should be. The flavor was off somehow too.. probably it was just the stale flavor.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

I'm a true believer in giving back to the community but more importantly following your dreams. For this I would like to dedicate my 700th review to Mozzeria.\n\nMozzeria is owned by Melody and Russel Stein, the first deaf couple in SF (possibly the nation) to open a restaurant. Mozzeria is an Italian restaurant serving traditional and non-traditional pastas and pizzas. \n\nIts official grand opening is this Friday, 12.9.11, however, they are offering two tasting dinners this week with net proceeds going to charity. Dining for a Cause? I just couldn't give up the opportunity to do so.\n\nLast night, my friend and I came to Mozzeria's 7:30 PM tasting dinner to benefit the California School for the Deaf and the Deafhood Foundation. Here's the tasting menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chZfJOs022rr8DufI4r3Uw?select=Cqspz6xpcaOIoVNp2BC-mw (sorry I couldn't enlarge it further). Full menu will be available on opening day. Beer and wine only until they get their liquor license at the end of the month. \n\nF O O D\n*MOZZERIA BAR ($7)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chZfJOs022rr8DufI4r3Uw?select=hczuoWWfS0NP-I-4x_BcNA\nThe panko crusted jumbo mozzarella stick was fried to a light golden brown and laid atop a tangy marinara sauce and topped with a fried basil leaf. It was lightly crunchy on the outside with a stretchy oooey goooeyness on the inside.\n\n*PORCINI SALAME & SHERRY JELLY ($6)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chZfJOs022rr8DufI4r3Uw?select=qVIGXrQCyJvw_iXzPHNGyQ\nLacking in substance, there were just two small crostinis with a thin slices of salame forming a half sphere. I wasn't keen with the jelly as it had more of a liquid consistency.\n\n*FRESH MOZZARELLA PIZZA w/ Neapolitan Sauce & Basil ($12): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chZfJOs022rr8DufI4r3Uw?select=cgvC_Io22hnw-Utzzc_31w\nServed piping hot out of the oven, the slightly blistered crust was crunchy with a toothsome chew. The crust was sturdy throughout the center; neither soggy nor crisp. The Neapolitan sauce was fresh, vibrant, and tangy and the mozzarella was milky with the basil giving a touch of herbaceousness.\n\n*CARAMELIZED ONION, FRESH MOZZARELLA & PANCETTA PIZZA ($14): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chZfJOs022rr8DufI4r3Uw?select=RCR3JjBSLhr3uKDm2ADyZg\nOur favorite dish of the night, this pizza also had a slightly blistered crust that was crunchy with a toothsome chew. It was more cheesy than the Margherita and had more of a flavor profile with the salty richness from the chunks of pancetta and the sweetness from the caramelized onions.\n\nBoth pizzas have 4 slices each and are more individually sized.\n\n*ARUGULA PESTO w/ Trofie, Milk-Braised Pork & Pinata ($8): \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/chZfJOs022rr8DufI4r3Uw?select=F79PlDgNruncUGa4hzoMng\nOur least favorite dish of the night, the pasta dish was underseasoned and lacking in texture especially with the mushy peppers. Although the trofie (Ligurian gnocchi) was cooked to a perfect al-dente and the pork was ultra soft with a creaminess from braising in the milk, it could have benefited with a more assertive pesto and toasted pine nuts for some texture contrast (just my overcritical two cents).\n\nS E R V I C E\nGiven it was a tasting dinner, it wasn't your typical dinner service.

The highlight of the restaurant is the Stefano Ferrara wood-burning pizza oven from Naples displayed in the dining area.\n\nIt's a small restaurant with about ~26 person dining room (good for parties of 2 only) and seating for 6 at the bar. My only gripe was the tables were lined up too close to each other so your chair is basically hitting your neighbors in back of you.\n\nP A R K I N G\nDifficult street parking.\n\nWith some minor tweaks and refinement with the food, I think Mozzeria will be a solid addition to The Mission, one of SF's foodie centrals. \n\nMozzeria is truly a one-of-a-kind restaurant that has given me a new outlook in life.

The space is nice and it's conveniently located.  We quickly learned about the admirable hiring policy of only deaf staff.  They are very pleasant people and attentive...at times.  But we had an overall bad experience and mainly due to the food.  \nUnfortunately the system of taking orders and calling a staff member over is not well thought out.  You end up either in a guessing game, Googling sign language (which was actually appreciated) or pointing to menu items on tiny font.  We did get everything ordered but when only one item comes out every 15 minutes including water, and staff walk away each time without waiting for 5 seconds, you end up feeling like they are not considering the situation at hand.  You can't pay obviously high prices for high end pizzeria food items and get this kind of inexperienced service. Granted this was our first time!\nBut onto the food...unfortunately we ordered the salumi pizza amd meatballs app. The pizza was blackened on the outside and hardly browned underneath.  The sign of too hot an oven and not cooked long get enough. FYI  It was not hat busy of a night.  The sauce lacked body. You have complex sauce at delfina, zero zero and others but this was flat.  the toppings were bunched together in patches creating islands of grease.  The meatballs which came 20 minutes after the pizza were bland.  Not enough fat, salt and herbs.  \nAgain, I appreciate the concept and hope this was isolated to one night or the owners wake up and realize the key elements are off.  But the high prices coupled with the food and service we experienced put us off.", "author": "Darius D."}

Maybe this place really needs to be eaten dine-in only because by the time they are delivered and even gently reheated the pizza is not good.  Mushroom pizza was pretty tasteless. Margherita de buffala was a bit better but still nothing to rave about. Crust dried out by the time we ate the pizza so can't really say much about it.

Also you'll have to park on the street you might have to circle couple times for finding a space to parallel park on. But it is all worth it, the pizza and the service are amazing.

And then I saw the waitress sign to another waitress, and to the chef, and finally, even the man dining alone signed on his way out. What an amazing discovery. I have to admit, I had never really thought about the challenges that the hearing-impaired must have in communicating with strangers. Whether one signs or lip reads, having to identify yourself as hearing-impaired in every first interaction must get really tiring. I think it's awesome that there's a restaurant in San Francisco where the hearing-impaired and their friends can go without having to worry about that. \n\nBut please do not skip Mozzeria if you are not hearing impaired! The pizza was really, really good. Mozzeria specializes in Italian-style pizza with crackling thin crust and fresh toppings. I recommend the roast duck pizza with hoisin sauce and green onion. It's like an Italian twist on Chinese duck pancakes. (Have I mentioned that I'm a big fan of anything half-Asian?)\n\nMozzeria is also family-friendly. That's actually how we ended up there.

Spring pea with green garlic and ricotta soup was very flavorful. The lasagna with braised lamb, chili paste, polenta, roasted tomato, goat cheese and spinach was quite a rendition that I have not had, especially with polenta that gave such a nice texture. Had a glass of Josh cab from Sonoma and it was a decent pairing that brought out the taste of the dish.\n\nThe chocolate walnut torte was rich with lots of dark chocolate, which paired well with the cap.\n\nThey also have a big pizza oven, definitely something to come back for as well.", "author": "T L."}

I am extremely picky about pizza - I love thin crust and the sauce has to be just right - not too sweet and full of flavor. Their wood-fired oven pizza is incredible. The crust is thin and perfect (Neopolitan style). The sauce is out of this world (pomodoro tomato sauce) -- in fact, you can order a side of sauce to dip your pizza crusts in for $3. We had the margherita pizza and charcuterie pizza. Both delicious, though my boyfriend and I both agreed that the margherita was better. Their wine selection is very nice too. \n\nThe restaurant is deaf-owned and run, so you will interact with deaf waiters! Don't worry if you don't know sign language - they have paper & pen available at the table for you in case you need to write down questions or what you would like to order. You just need to gesture a bit with them - such as making eye contact, speaking clearly, and pointing to the menu what you would like. Do keep in mind that deafness varies - I am deaf and can lip read, so speaking clearly would help for me, but it seemed to me that the majority of the waiters/staff there were very much so deaf.

The first time, I ordered the Margherita pizza (by the way, if you have time, go on Mozzeria's website, read their blogs and see how they got their brick oven and how it works). It was just pure perfection. The pizza is nice and thin, and the crust is soft. \n\nFor dessert, I forget the name, but it was a coffee cake with apples and a caramel sauce on top.....holy goodness.. \nSo we know the food is incredible. Enough said.\n\nAs far as the customer service, I was very surprised how even though all the employees are Deaf, they still have different ways of making all their customers feel welcome; hearing or not. So you don't need to be an ASL master to eat here (however, any efforts made are greatly appreciated). \n\nThe only downside is that the food is a bit pricey. But considering the level of service and quality you receive, it makes it totally worth it :)", "author": "Mitchell P."}

It was lightly crisp on the outside and bursting with flavor, garnished tastily with basil paste etc, and very prettily, too. People sitting next to us had beautiful antipasto plates with an assortment of marinated vegetables including large fava beans--also v. southern Italian.\n\nNice atmosphere/decor. If you sit at the bar, you can watch the pizza making. The pizza chef is in charge of an enormous wood-burning pizza oven that reaches 1,000 degrees inside, but is just 79 degrees at its mouth. The pizzas go in and come out beautifully blistered with pools of melted mozzarella within minutes. Chef said they use almond wood for the flavor it imparts.\n\nDeaf staff are welcoming and enjoy communicating with customers, whether via lip-reading, or hand signals or writing on scraps of paper--or a combination of all.\n\nIt definitely was a dinner to remember.", "author": "Barbara N."}

Casual, yet trendy; upscale, but not pretentious; intimate enough for a date, yet I saw one young child.  The centerpiece was a huge wood burning oven.  The owner said they bought it in Italy.  It was nice, inlaid with tile, and made for a really cool attraction while sitting at or near the bar -- anywhere in the place, really since it's a fairly small restaurant.\n\nFor the food...  for starters, I had the Mozzeria Bar...  basically fried mozzarella cheese.  It came with a nice red sauce, slightly chunky and was very good.  It was not your typical fried cheese stick from a frozen bag like they serve at TGIAppleChiliTuesday's...  You could tell this was fresh and made on site.  I don't normally get fried anything, but I'd have this again.  \n\nThen I had the Duck Rilletes.  I had to ask what the Rilletes were.

The cheese was phenomenal.  The crust was delicious.  I also enjoyed the flavor of the sauce.  \n\nProscuitto charcuterie:  was adequate.  the crostini were a little too crispy, and there were not enough of them.  its always a pet peeve of mine when a restaurant does not acknowledge how many people are going to be eating a dish, and they give you portions that cannot be evenly split.  for instance, there were two of us, and they give us a pile of meat with only three crostini.  the pickled cauliflower was good, and the proscuitto was sliced paper thin.  \n\nthe pasta dish:  i dont remember what it was called, but it was really, really underwhelming.  the pasta didnt taste fresh, and as far as i could tell, it only had a really basic tomato sauce.  it just didnt measure up, and i could have made better pasta at home.\n\nI had the pinot gris which was fine....nothing too memorable.

There was some soft music on -- not sure who it was for -- but that's it.\n\nSecond off, they have the same kind of pizza oven that Una Pizza Neopolotana does, and a pizzaiolo who is almost as talented.  So forget the whole deaf restaurant thing: go to Mozzeria just for the pizza.  It's good, it's \"top ten pizzarias in SF\" good.  The crust is chewy and tangy, clearly the result of a natural rise, and they offer dipping stuff for you to dip your pizza in after you've eaten the toppings portion.\n\nAlso, order the homemade burrata, you'll be sorry if you don't.\n\nThey also have a very nice, but short, \"strong beer\" list.\n\nNow, the reasons for 4 stars instead of 5 are a few, and I'm writing them out here just because I hope the owner reads this.  These are not major detractions to the restaurant, just stuff that keeps it from being \"amazing\" rather than \"really good\":\n\n1. lose the toasted almonds on the pizza.  They taste completely wrong and don't go with anything.  If you're dining there, ask them to hold the almonds (you'll need to write it out)\n\n2. somehow redesign the menu to make it easier to point to things.  I'll freely admit that I have no idea how to do this, but with deaf servers, it's a requirement.\n\n3. Offer more homemade mozzarella dishes.  The Mozzarella Bar in Rome offers a plate with 5 kinds of mozzarella (regular, burrata, smoked, straccino, and pepper); could you do that?  I'd totally come in and sit at the bar and get wine just to order that.\n\n4. Do more simple, low-topping, traditional Italian pizzas, like a pizza bianca with just dabs of fior di latte and herbs.  It would be fantastic!\n\nI repeat: the creative criticism above are just \"enhancement requests\"; this is a good restaurant with great pizza, and you should brave the deaf thing and try it.\n\nAnd if you actually speak Amslan, you're in for a great time.", "author": "Josh B."}

They couldn't even offer us an apology, just said \"here\" and threw a check on our table. Um thanks...\n\nIt seems as if this restaurant relies solely on a \"deaf\" gimmick, and it won't ever gain a reputation based on its food or service...", "author": "Monica R."}

Rarely does she urge me to write a positive comment, or anything at all, about a restaurant. In this case, she suggested to me I praise the establishment. So that is about the best compliment I can share: my wife was satisfied.\n\nThis place is written up from time to time, because it is owned and operate by a deaf couple. That means there are minor adjustments to be made: all of the staff used American Sign Language when we visited, and they had notepads and pencils on tables. (We know a bit of ASL, but not enough to do more than muddle through.) \n\nThat is nice and a bonus. It's not enough to sustain a business in a competitive environment.This is a hip, happening neighborhood.\n\nBut even if this were a joint run by hearing people, it would warrant commendation to friends. The eggplant parmesan was the best we had ever had. The salad, with beets and candied almonds, was very good. The pizza, one GF and another on regular dough, were made in an authentic Neopolitan oven. That's the other claim to fame here: the wood fire gives the thin crust its perfect texture, though it also warms up the diners (good or bad depending on the season).\n\nIt's not the fastest place and parking is not easy. \n\nI urge you to check it out.

The only deaf run establishment that I know of, and I don't agree with the other reviews that they're looking for a hand out. The family style option for parties bigger that six or eight provided tons of food at $25 a head and was less of a headache for large parties. Appetizers included a delicious fresh mozzarella with a tasty sun dried tomato spread and fresh basil leaves. Another was a deep fried, encrusted cheese with a marinara sauce. The arancini was delicious and is a must-have at this place. The sausage pizza with caramelized onions, wild mushrooms was quite tasty. Pesto pasta was not as flavorful as the meatballs with the straw pasta. Dessert consisted of beignet-like doughnuts with scoops of chocolate mousse to dip it in.\nSangria was decent and plenty of beers on tsp- who doesn't want squid ink?\nThe wait staff was excellent and they provide easy typed menus to point at, understand universal hand gestures (like drink), and are great at lip-reading. They even play background music for us auditory dependent beings. Best part is that you can be as loud and raunchy as you want, and won't necessarily bug your waitstaff. \nI recommend trying to get a table away from the insanely hot brink oven which is exposed toward the back of the restaurant, unless you naturally run cold or it's absolutely freezing outside.", "author": "Naomi K."}

Most of the crew working is hearing-impaired, and they're absolute rockstars. Our server came up and introduced himself, and my date and I never had a communication problem--our service was stellar. It was very cool to be in such a quiet restaurant, and to block out other senses to focus on taste.\n\nFirst of all, the veal pork meatballs were absolutely ridiculous. I wish I could have a constant IV flow of those into my body at all times. The gnocchi was probably one of the most interesting things I've ever eaten. It had some sort of sweet, dark sauce at the bottom of the plate, but on the other side of the plate was a soft ricotta cheese that totally cut the acidic flavors of that dark, sweet sauce. \n\nThe Italian sausage pizza was some of the best pizza I've had in the city. Everything was perfect, from the red onions to the fennel. I can't wait to come back for this. For desert, we had another VERY intense, yet super complex dish--the brownie. It was sprinkled with walnuts, fried bananas and had a very tangy--but spicy--fruit glaze. I wasn't anticipating the spice and was totally surprised.\n\nGo for the food, the experience and the service. You absolutely will not regret it.", "author": "Tyler H."}

The service was great, the server we had checked in with us often, made sure we were happy, and the hearing issue wasn't a problem.

Reflective and peaceful, with light banter with my boyfriend sprinkled in.\n\nWe split the signature pizza, Peking Duck, and it was phenomenal! The crust was amazing (almost naan-like to a degree) and the ingredients were so simple, but with amazing flavor. \n\nThe atmosphere is good, and the wood burning oven is beautiful.

Deftly taking orders on his iPad, the waiter accurately recorded my selections despite the overly loud classic rock (Stones, Clash, and Beatles) emanating from the sound system (didn't seem to bother him; oh, he was deaf ...).\n\nThe limited menu features two salads, two small plates, a selection of charcuterie, two pastas, and four desserts.  The stars are supposed to be (emphasis on \"supposed to be\") the five pizzas--from marguerita to wood roasted Italian eggplant with red onion, yellow and green peppers, and pesto.\n\nThe minuscule pieces of salmon seemed an after-thought in the otherwise unspectacular wild arugula salad with sherry-shallot vinaigrette and (deep fried) bread crumbs ($9).  Its crust cooked beyond pleasantly blistered (read that \"burned\") in places, the pancetta, fresh mozzarella, and caramelized onion pizza ($14) was a little soggy in the center, indicating that the pizzaiolo does not yet have full knowledge of the oven.  The lemon ricotta gnocchi with sage butter and orange zest was good, but certainly nothing to write home to your nonna about.\n\nFour beers on tap and a small, selection of wines are available.  Again, nothing that will set the world on its ear (hearing enabled or not).\n\nTony's and Gialina need fear not: the newcomer, Mozzeria, is certainly not a contender for the SF pizzeria Napoletana crown.", "author": "CJ G."}

Seriously, no big deal. I organized a birthday dinner party for myself with ten friends last summer; I coordinated via email (which I prefer to the phone anyway), and everything was set. Ordering at the restaurant was super easy too: if you don't know sign language, just point to what you want, or jot it down on a note pad. I can't stand when people ask 900 questions about a simple pizza anyway, so this actually made ordering a breeze. (The only difficulty encountered was when my boyfriend tried to secretly get them to put a candle in a cake for me, but even that worked out.)\n\nThe food is solid too. I like to keep it simple with pizza so I liked the margherita the best, but even the funky ones are good. And the sangria is super strong and spot-on.

If they've got it on the menu, order the duck hoisin pizza. It's phenomenal. Their margherita pizza is the best in this city because the sauce is light and not too sweet, the cheese is melted but not liquid, and the crust is just perfect. It's crunchy in places, but still doughy and chewy the way you want a pizza to be. We haven't had a bad pizza here, yet.\n\nTheir salads and non-pizza items are similarly excellent. I particularly love the beet salad, which comes with golden and purple beets, goat cheese, candied walnuts and a really great spring mix. \n\nFor Valentine's Day, we got the prix fixe, which was $85 for two people. We ate so much food. It came with two first courses, two second courses, a heart-shaped margherita pizza, two desserts, and two glasses of Prosecco! \n\nIf you don't sign, do NOT be turned off. Yes, the servers, owners, cooks, and other employees all sign and use ASL with each other. But there's a pad of paper and pen on every table, and one of the servers speaks English as well. What I love about this place is that they're patient with me while I try my pidgin signing; they're so great while I mangle their language. I always feel welcome here, and it's great to see a place where Deaf and HoH folks can feel at home. I love seeing that there's no negotiation of communication when a signer walks in; s/he just walks up to the bar and starts signing with the bartender or pizza-cook. It's a great place to go and be reminded how much a little patience and good will can help someone who doesn't speak the main language (a nice reminder for me to be similarly patient and friendly when I meet people whose English isn't perfect).\n\nAll in all, I love this place and we go here about three times a month.

I wish there were more potatoes in there, but other than that it was heaven on earth.\n\nWe also order the margarita pizza and mushroom pizza (substituted goat cheese with mozzarella). Both were awesome. We also ordered the dukkah dipping option for our crusts, which included a combination of different sweet and salty herbs and spices. Very interesting flavor and very good.

I've been to Mozz a few times and can safely say that I have never been disappointed with any single item on the menu. Each dish is better than the next. I'll say 3 of note: \n\nFirst, the pizza's from their wood burning fireplace are light, thin, paired with fresh and incredible toppings. They are as good Delphin's and better than Farina's. \nSecond, the burrata cheese is mandatory to order when I sit down at Mozz. Everyone enjoys the mild and delicate simplicity of this incredible cheese. \nLast, the meatball appetizer for some odd reason is something I think about and crave on a regular basis!\n\nObviously, the chef and the staff know what they're doing.

It was raining, making Mozzeria was quiet on a Wednesday evening. We were ushered in by a woman that was pointing & smiling. OK this was confusing but whatever, it took me a minute to realize she was deaf. Then I noticed our waitstaff was deaf too. I start looking around and then I saw the chef signing in ASL. This made me smile. One more reason why SF is a magical city and how Mozzeria is a special place.\n\nThe food was amazing. We started with the house made burrata with roasted red peppers & basil oil for $10, it was really big in portion better for a group of 3-4 people. Burrata mean 'buttered' in Italian and the creamy texture of this cheese lived up to its name. \n\nThe soup of the day was vegetarian minestrone with roasted tomatoes & kale, it was smoke & had a rich, layered broth. My dining partner swears this is the best minestrone he has ever had.\n\nWe split the Japanese pumpkin ravioli with walnut gremolata, it needed a splash of salt but then it was mouth magic. The dish was topped with a few salad greens which contrasted nicely with the sweet, soft fresh pasta. Topped with a sprinkle of crispy, dried onions & the bed of pesto in which it laid upon all gave an extra burst of color & flavor. \n\nThe margherita pizza for $15 was good, it was on par with Delfina in terms of the quality- the crust was a bit softer but had a more wood-fired taste which I liked, the mozzarella di buffala cheese was good but the sauce was not quite Delfina worthy. \n\nThe hazelnut panna cotta with a homemade biscotti, topped with aged balsamic vinegar & a small strawberry. The dessert was a perfect ending, there is a trick to this dessert- on their own each item is good but not exciting but then you take a small bite of each at the same time, it really makes you realize the genius of flavors set before you.", "author": "Shannon Z."}

After years of shameless experiments (which has occured all over in the world during the past decade) with freaky fusion fiascos, Mozzeria hasn't only redefined fusion, but it also has redefined the Pizza itself...which is a tricky trick because savory pies can be easily bastardized, becoming sacrilegious to the very existence of pizza.\n\nThis place is nicely compact, elegantly casual and SUPER delicious!  The crust, the cheese, everything is perfect about the pizza here, along with side dishes and pasta specials. Almos wafer-thin, crispy, smoky, chewy crust, excellent sweet and tangy sauce, and excellent cheese. Dare you enhance it with mozzarella di buffala (buffalo milk). It does tend to be a slightly messier pizza, but the flavor will impress the most criticizing Sicilian grandmamma-mia. It is definitely a 'knife and fork pizza' until cooled off. \n\nSometimes, you do have a rare (if not frequent) dilemma between Italian and Chinese.....like deciding between eating mu-shu duck at a Chinese eatery AND a darn decadent pizza, just step into Mozzeria for their super yummy roasted duck pizza with hoisin sauce and garnished with spring onions. Well-executed :)\n\nI've yet got to sample their recently unveiled brunch menu. Can't wait!  Mozzeria seems to be savvy enough...by being in the loop on what kind of tap beers that the city locals really like. \n\nYes so it happens....to humbly be the first ever Deaf-owned/operated dining establishment in the whole history of SF ever-thriving restaurant industry. The service and the food, by far, do deserve the infrared crimson spotlight! Along with other equally amazing local pizzerias as such as Beretta, Delfina, Ragazza, and Gialina...Mozzeria has already earned its own place in the top league on this hilly peninsula. Oh, why do the name of pizzerias usually end with an \"a\"? Yeah, I could definitely taste a lot of vowels on the pizza.\n\nLast, but not least, this charming pizzeria has apparently manifested itself into an awesome haven where sign language users and the greater hearing public would be able to interact comfortably.....in harmony and sharing the universal love for the food :)", "author": "Jesada P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-12", "description": "We went here on a Friday night for a party of four. We didn't make reservations but hoped that we'd be able to get a table if we showed up opening time. It all worked out and we were seated at the first table near the entrance. \n\nThe pizzeria is modern looking yet classic too. The hardwood floors are apparently from way back when. The owners were excited to uncover the beautiful old wood when they tore up the top floor. The hardwood was part of the original building it seems and is very old and not something that can be found easily so I thought it was really cool that they tried to keep true to the aesthetic of their building's history while incorporating modern elements like bright white walls and retro red chairs and cool lamp fixtures. \n\nThe big ass Napoletana-style brick oven stands near one end of the bar and is a humongous shining luminous thing. Very cool. I know Una Pizzeria has the same oven so I was excited to see that Mozzeria carried this brick oven as well. You can see the fire-burning wood and the heat in the oven as the staff is popping in their pizzas. \n\nOverall, ambiance is cool, now on to the FOOD and DRINKS! I loved the house red. I forget the exact name but you just tell the waitress that you want the house red and you're set for the night. It's affordable but very lovely red wine that goes down smoothly. Juicy (not dry) red wine goes best with pizza. We ordered margharita pizza, onion and pancetta pizza, and duck pizza. We four LOVED the duck pizza hands down. That's the best! It's only available on Friday nights so we were relieved we came at the right time. I love hoisin sauce and on a pizza, ooooh la la! \n\nThe margharita pizza was delicious and puffy and crispy and dripping olive oil and herbs in the middle, just the way it is done in Naples. For those of you who complain about a soggy inner crust, that's actually how it's done in Naples and it is divine. If you prefer the American sort of pizza, find the nearest Dominoes. I will say that the onion and pancetta pizza was nice but not a wowser like the margharita and the duck. I felt something was missing in the onion and pancetta. My friend who loves onions was obsessed with the onion and pancetta pizza so I guess to each his/her own. \n\nWe ordered the Mozzeria bar and that came with an unexpected but exciting heat! It's an appetizer of a large Mozzarella bar panko crusted and fried with a light tomato arrabiata-style sauce to dredge the bar in. It's delicious if you can handle the heat. It's not recommended for those who want the typical mozarrella cheese sticks with tomato sauce because this appetizer really packs a kick. Consider it a grown-up version of the mozzarella cheese. \n\nThen desserts! We ordered the chocolate cake with vanilla bean sauce. I think we overdid it at this point. I was way too stuffed so it's hard for me to tell just how good the cake was. Sure did look very pretty though with the vanilla bean glaze drizzling down the cake! But if I were to come here again, I'd just get the margharita or the duck pizza and a glass of house red and I'm set for the night. \n\nThis restaurant is one of the more unique restaurants in the sense that it is owned by a Deaf couple (capitalized 'D' is a big deal to convey the culture and pride of their community) and it employs or brings in the works of Deaf carpenters, Deaf waiters (including hearing waiters who can sign), Deaf everything. You see hands flying in the air moving in all sorts of intricate shapes and motions. Their expressions and body language is fun and entertaining. It's just a very neat environment to be in and I recommend you learn some ABCs or a few signs to try communicate with the staff here. It's just a really unique experience for folks who aren't familiar with sign language and it's cool to see it in action. Definitely a locally-owned family business and with a lot of heart.", "author": "Pamela L."}

Their total lack of availability via phone and ridiculous online reservation system for groups over 5 is so unbelievably unhelpful and cumbersome that I just don't want to try to give these people my business.\n\nWe used their website reservation system for groups, which is separate from their normal online system.  You need to submit a form to request a reservation for 6 people, so we submitted one at 10:00 am hoping for a reservation that evening at 6:00.  I realize that it was unlikely as it was a Saturday night, but we just wanted to check since this place is right across the street from where were attending a concert that evening. \n\nI don't begrudge a place that has no availability on a weekend...fine.  Just tell me that you're full up and we'll try again another night.  But when we hadn't heard anything by 2:00, I just thought I'd call there to check so that if their answer was the expected \"Sorry, no room for you!\" we might still have a chance at arranging some other nearby place.   I called the number on the website 3 times and kept getting what I thought was a wrong number...a random person answering who said nothing more than \"That line is ringing for you.\" or \"We're waiting for a connection.\"  No identification of the restaurant, no introduction as an answering service.  When I finally realized that I had reached the right place, I asked about our reservation request and the response from the service was \"They aren't answering right now...would you like to leave a message?\"  I did.  And someone called back about 30 minutes later....3 times.  The first two times, the phone rang once and disconnected.  The second time I called them right back and they were unavailable again.  When they finally rang through, a supremely bored and unhelpful guy said \"You left a message?\"...much to my consternation since, presumably, he had received the e-request and should have had all of that information. But I described yet again what we wanted, and he just said \"Oh.  Huh. Hang on and I'll check.\" And then left me on hold for several minutes.  At which point he came back and said \"How many people, again?\"\n\nWhatever, dude...sorry to interrupt your busy schedule of slacking, but there are too many other restaurants in the mission that would be more than happy to answer their own phone and give us a simple yes or no answer.  \n\nDone.", "author": "Melissa C."}

I wanted to really like it, but in the end the food was only \"meh\".\n\nMozzeria is the first restaurant owned and fully operated by a deaf couple. I had no idea until we first walked in and were greeted by sheer silence and lots of ASL, or in our case, nodding and pointing. About half the staff we're deaf, but about all the staff were fluent in ASL. They've really tailored the restaurant to the hearing impaired and have thus built a great community-like feel with lots of ASL patrons. Mozzeria is therefore probably home to the quietest restaurant you'll ever find anywhere, and its a really cool place to just sit back and appreciate life and the sheer skill+hard-work that goes into making a restaurant work. Kudo Mozzeria.\n\nBut to the food... \nWe wanted to order the roast duck, but they were out... so we opted for the porcini salame/sherry jelly charcuterie. We also ordered the prosciutto/wild arugula/fresh mozzarella pizza, but somehow our waitress interpreted our pointing to the pancetta/fresh mozzarella/caramelized onion pizza instead. The owner nicely gave us the prosciutto pizza on the house, and had the chefs whip up our pancetta pizza... so I suppose orders lost through translation still have their perks?\n\nThe salame/sherry charcuterie was an utter disappointment... the sherry jelly left an awful taste in our mouths. And the pizzas - both pizzas were okay, nothing special - all the ingredients/toppings tasted fresh, but we're unmemorable. The worst part was the pizza crust - it was extremely soggy in the middle, not holding up the toppings well; bits were burnt and inedible; and overall it was very bland and kinda doughy/chewy. I appreciate what they we're going for, with the wood-burning oven and classic Italian pizzas, but their execution was just not good.\n\nAnd though the service was kind, they could use a few changes to how they run their establishment to better cater to both ASL and non-ASL patrons. Either provide menus with larger text (for pointing) or actually assign non-deaf/English-speaking waitstaff to the non-ASL patrons...

Wow I've definitely found my new favorite Pizza spot PLUS BOTTOMLESS MIMOSAS!!!!! \nIf you know me you know that I LOVE the bottomless mimosa option and this restaurant was just the ticket. \n\nWalking down to the Castro thinking that I want something loud and hectic I instantly feel a grab from my friend saying, \"oo this looks good!\" It took me one glance and I say sure! We were greeted by a lovely lady who could only sign. She was completely adorable! She sat us down in the mildly busy restaurant and my friends and I were hooked. Bottomless Mimosas... AND They are ACTUALLY GOOD! Something you won't find too often with that kind of offer! My friends had Margherita Pizzas and I had a Sausage one. All were cooked with a crisp and delicious in flavor! We walked out with a hefty bill but that was A OK. It was well worth it. \n\nDefinitely 5 stars for sure.

Naturally, being a new restaurant, they needed a bit of time to find their groove.  \n\nMozzeria is family-owned and run by wonderful Deaf folks, as are many of their staff who use American Sign Language.  However, if you come with an open mind and heart, I can guarantee you communication will NOT be an issue (in fact, it'll actually be fun).\n\nOrdered the house red - smooth and delicious!  A great choice.\n\nThe quality of the food is evident at this restaurant - the owners do not cut corners. The olive oil was one of the best I've tasted.   I'd suggest that they provide a small bowl of the olive oil along with the bread when we are seated.  \n\nThe signature Mozzeria Bar oozed deliciousness, and the tomato sauce was delicate and flavorful.  \n\nAs for the pizzas, we had the Neapolitian and roasted eggplant.

So we went during opening night, and I'm not going to diss them for the administrative fumbles on a night like that.  However, the food is the food, and that was eh at best.  \n\nFor the administrative fumbles: by 9pm they ran out of their signature dish which the place is named after, and the gnocchi.  Sat down about 15 min after the reservation, and took a while to get the menus.   But, it was the opening night, and I wouldn't have cared for any of that if the food blew me away.\n\nThe food: the pasta dish and pizza were on par with going to friends house for dinner...you know, it's fine cuz you're at your friends place, but if you paid for it you'd be disappointed.  The pasta was under cooked, and had nothing to it that warranted amazement or made it stand out...kinda tasted like warm pasta salad (read: bland)  Note that all the dishes were very cheap though.\n\nNow the pizza.  No way no way no way.  Seems like every place buys a brick oven and throws dough in it assuming magically a gem will be produced in 10 min.  The pizza was just all doughy and plain, below average...like I said, felt like we could have made it at home.  There is something to be said about east coast pizza that the west can not replicate.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-21", "description": "Went to dine at this Neapolitan restaurant last night with a co-worker friend.  It's snugged tightly between houses with a sushi bar next door.  Nice! \n\nThe first thing you'd notice is the tight space around in the restaurant.  It was obvious they went for the location that's on the 16th and Guerrero St. over space availability and you will not have that much of space if you are going to install a cavernous pizza fire oven in the middle of the area and they also had a bar countertop too, so there wasn't that much room right there.  The interior design reminds me a bit of Chipotle mexican restaurant with a strong affinity towards white and black, and some steel to give it a modern look.\n\nIf you haven't figured out yet, the restaurant is family-owned as well as deaf-owned, with a deaf couple running the business.  Quite naturally, about the half of patrons were deaf and it was clear they were quickly making themselves comfortable at the restaurant, with the ease of communication and an understanding in deaf manners and culture.  I knew almost each of them, so it was nice to be saying hi to them in sign language and had some small talk.  My co-worker friend, hearing, seemed amused by the whole experience and remarked that it is like traveling to another country with a different culture and different language.  Exactly.\n\nIt's pretty ironic that the best service came not from adult waiters but by the very young waitress whose age was 14 years old.  She's the daughter of the deaf couple owner, a CODA, and she also has a younger brother who's working as a busboy, although not as interested as his sister was.  She quickly swiped through an app on the iPad and placed orders while another waiter seemed to have some problem figuring out how to use the app or maybe he's just counting his tips and made sure that it got accounted for.  I couldn't help but wonder if she'd follow in the footsteps of her mom who worked very hard to open the first ever deaf-owned restaurant in the whole city of San Francisco.  Maybe she'd go to college and get an MBA, then she'd be able to take the restaurant to the next level, perhaps with a larger space and more staff.\n\nOK, enough with external lull observation, what about the food?  my co-worker friend and I ordered two pizzas -- mozzarella cheese with red tomato and another with eggplants/onions.  They were very good and I realize there was more emphasis on the taste of toppings and red sauce, along with the dough.  That's what neapolitan pizzas are, I suppose.  We also ordered an appetizer, red cabbage brusetta, which was awesome.  It's the olive oil that was a key ingredient, really bringing the flavor out so we enjoyed the appetizer very much. They have a couple of beers on draft and one of them was Fat Tire and it tasted really fresh.  I had another beer too, a black on black, which was yummy.\n\nI'd highly recommend to make a reservation beforehand so you'd be ensured you'll have a table ready, since they don't have a ton of space to accommodate patrons with hungry stomachs.  If you happen to know some sign language, you'd have a fun time being able to talk to them and ask what they'd recommend.  Don't miss out this cozy restaurant!", "author": "Nathan K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-06", "description": "We were very excited to eat at Mozzeria because we had heard so much about it in the social media. When we were finally in the area we thought we would try there. The first impression: cozy, cute restaurant. Parking was hard to find (it was a Friday night, go figure). The hostess was very nice and welcoming. \n\nUpon arrival we learned that it was important to have a reservation- we did not have one, and the hostess said the next reservation was coming in about 45 minutes and asked us if that would be enough time for us to eat. Kind of odd to be told how long we had the table for but we went for it anyway. Make sure you have a reservation before you go.\n\nThe food was okay. House wine was fine for, er, house wine. The whole time we were there, our server seemed distracted and flustered. Perhaps it was because it was a very busy night and they were new in the restaurant business. \n\nThe main issue was food which could be greatly improved. What we ordered: the duck pizza that is only available on Fridays, the prociutto/mozzarella/arugula pizza, and the only salad on the menu. The pizzas were really just toasted flat bread with few speckles of toppings. We were really excited about the duck pizza but were disappointed that there was almost no visible sauce on it. You could literally count the number of duck pieces. For 18 dollars I would like to see a more generous portion- give me more ducks, pour more hoisin sauce, and put more green onions on it! Our pizza literally had no sauce at all and it was a very bland pizza. \n\nThe prociutto/mozzarrella/arugula pizza was also just okay. We had expected there to be more cheese, but there were only about 7 dollops of mozzarrella about the size of a quarter. It would be a better pizza with more mozzarrella.\n\nPlease remember to cut all the pizzas before you bring them to the table- the kitchen forgot to slice our duck pizza and we had to cut it ourselves.\n\nBoth pizzas were so soggy in the bottom that when we held up a slice it wilted and all toppings just rolled over and fell off. \n\nFor 15-18 dollars per pizza, I expect the food to be a lot better than what I got here...\n\nService was friendly but rather slow. \n\nWe know this is a new restaurant so they are probably still figuring things out. Hopefully they can take the feedback and improve their food and service. We noticed that most of Mozzeria's 4- or 5-star ratings are given by members of the Deaf Community. While it's understandable that they want to help promote this deaf-friendly venue, which is a rare find in and of itself, it's just as important to give an unbiased review that reflects the actual quality of food and service.", "author": "BlueSky Z."}

The hostess was deaf, but greeted everyone and held up a clipboard that asked if you had a reservation.  The place is definitely small, but once we were seated we didn't mind the coziness feel.  \n\nThe decor is nice and sleek.  Dark hardwood floors, cool light fixtures, black tables, a white (marble?) bar with industrial-style bar stools.  The coolest part is the oven.  It is beautiful!  \n\nWe ordered the Mozzeria bar which was delicious.  The tomato sauce they make is so good I wanted to lick the plate clean.  We also ordered the prosciutto plate with pickled cauliflower.  That was delicious as well.  I know its a small plate, but I wanted more!  The servings were just right.  I was ready for our pizza and didn't feel stuffed by the appetizers.\n\nFor the pizza we tried the margherita with fresh mozzarella.  No complaints here.  We also had the pancetta with caramelized onions.  There was just the right amount of pancetta.  The flavor was great.  We finished the meal off with the tiramisu.  So creamy and good.\n\nWith all of that food and a beer and a glass of wine the whole bill was $60 so not bad at all.  \n\nWe loved the food, ambiance, and the staff!

Here's my constructive criticisms:\n\nI was well aware it was going to be a hectic night as they waded through the kinks so I came prepared to be extra patient.  We actually sat down nearly on time for our reservation after being moved around a few times.  They were out of the wine and beer we wanted. #1: Stock your bar!!\n\n15 minutes after sitting to get a menu: no bueno.  They were just printed on paper, nothing fancy.  #2 Print 100s of menus and hand them out as you seat people.  As soon as you walk away you get distracted and forget them.\n\nWanted to try to mozzarella bar and the lemon gnocchi, but out of both!  #3 Stock your kitchen!  This is an excellent way to lose business!  You must have enough mozzarella especially if your name is Mozzeria!\n\nI knew the owners were deaf but learned so is most of the waitstaff.  On a busy night this makes communication difficult.  We worked around it, writing 'vegetarian' on a piece of paper...\n\nThe pesto pasta was so al dente it was crunchy, and wasn't pesto so much as just chopped up basil on top.  It was definitely missing salt and other seasonings.  I didn't care for it.  \n\nPizza dough was bland and chewy, I think missing again salt and olive oil in the dough.  Sidekick didn't like his salmon pizza (toppings were sparse) but I really liked the blue cheese, thyme, caramelized onion combo I got (once I added plenty of table salt to it).  Just the right amount of cheese and a good mix of flavors. But #4 season your food!\n\nThe good news is the price was right ($60 for two) and I might be enticed to come back in about 6 months if they get things rolling and good reviews come in on Yelp.

I was also disappointed that the lemon ricotta gnocchi was not on the menu for the evening, as I was looking forward to trying it.  It sounds delicious.  The interior is also a bit cramped and brighter than I'd like.  \n\nI love that they are welcoming to the deaf community (it is a segment that I admit to not being very cognizant of), but in hiring deaf servers, it obviously makes it harder, but not impossible, to communicate.  Other than the alphabet, I am not versed in ASL, and was resigned to pointing and gesturing, such as nods and thumbs-up for acknowledgements.  We almost ordered a pasta dish without the meat, and wondered how to communicate that (point at the meat word of the menu item and give the \"no\" gesture with a wave of the hand or shake of the head, then point to myself and the word \"vegetarian\" that's listed on the bottom of the menu?).  If anything, I am now more inclined to learn signing.\n\nEverything in consideration, I had a good experience, which is usually not the case in trying a new restaurant.

The pastas were really good, actually all the food was delicious.  They do go a little overboard using cheese, as almost all the dishes incorporated it somehow.  Definitely give it a try.", "author": "Dilly M."}

I will return and try it again due to the great food but hope the service is better.\n\nFirst, I am not hearing impaired and like many other posters, did not find there to be an issue communicating with the staff.  It was kind of like dining in a foreign country where you don't speak the language - a combo of pointing, gesturing, and writing at times.  That was different but kind of neat, and not an issue at all.  The host, bar tenders, and waiter all seemed totally cool dealing with non-ASL folks.\n\nNext, they were super accomodating in fitting in a large group on a Saturday night, which was so welcome and unexpected.  I did my reservation via email and the restaurant was prompt to respond to emails.  We had a wait a little bit for our table but not too long or beyond normail waits on a Sat night.\n\nThe food was delicious.  Yummy pizzas, creative appetizers, good wine selection.  I really enjoying everything I tried.\n\nThird, this is where the downfall was - the service was very spotty.  The server repeatedly took our silverware and plates between courses and never gave us new ones so when the food showed up, we have nothing to use to eat the food.  Then, there would be a wait and the food would get cold.  Also, they forgot to cut the pizzas - when you are sharing food, as we were, this was a challenge.  Especially when I didn't have any silverware to try to DIY.  Also, they forgot to give us napkins, and took some napkins away between courses (??) without replacing them.  So, there was a constant effort to wave down a server and get what we needed - it was annoying and a bit of a challenge if a waiter wasn't looking right at you.  All that being said, I think they were down staff that night so maybe it was an anomoly.  I hope so, bc asde from the service, I really liked this place.", "author": "Denise B."}

I will say the basil oil was quite a nice touch adding a this nice bright freshness to the dish. Dish is good just not exactly as expected, perhaps it was just our serving since other reviews rave about this dish.\n\nCrispy Pork: VERY crispy pork; if you're looking for a succulent, fatty piece of pork belly, definitely steer clear. Would have preferred just a nice crispy pork skin with the meat simply braised/slow-cooked and served as-is rather than deep frying the entire piece. Accompanying white beans were delicious.\n\nPizza: I don't recall which pizza we ordered, nor do I recall it being particularly memorable...I think that says enough. Simply not up to par with some of the more well-known pizza establishments in the city but I think they'll get there as they continue to break-in their huge pizza oven.\n\nWill probably give this place a shot in the future", "author": "David H."}

I had read that the owners were deaf, but I didn't realize that most of the staff is deaf as well. \n\nMy issue is mostly about the poor service we received. We arrived at 730 with a large group. It took a while for  the group to settle in. Once we did, it was around 8pm before the order was taken. The orders came out one at a time. We ordered first and everyone else had eaten before it became apparent our order had been forgotten. The waiter seemed to be confused about what we had and came back a few times, but it wasn't clear that we'd been forgotten at that point. We finally got our pizza...at 915pm. \n\nWhile the pizza was good, it only had a few pieces of meat on it. At $20 for a 12\" pizza, I would expect a little more. And after waiting for more than 1 hour for this pizza, it was an added insult. If I was reviewing on the pizza, I would give it 3 stars simply because it's overpriced for what you get. I'd rather eat at Little Star... \n\nWe got no apology or any kind of acknowledgment about this oversight. Had we not been with a large group, we would have canceled our order. While we do not sign, there was a person at our table who did, not to mention paper on the table to write on. The waiter could have communicated status of the forgotten pizza and given an apology to us....but he did not. \n\nSadly, we will never go back again.", "author": "Joan S."}

The owner even filled our water and made sure we were comfortable. It was nice seeing owners being involved.\n-decor - the inside of the restaurant is simple, yet styled. I also like the music selection.\n\nCons:\n-cost - the prices were reasonable, I suppose, but it was still a touch above what I'm comfortable paying for a small pizza.\n-temperature - because the oven is smack in the middle of the restaurant, it was BOILING inside.\n-wait time - it took quite awhile to get our food & check\n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience and I'd be interested in trying the brunch/lunch menu during the weekend sometime.

This is not your typical gnocchi.  They were browned til they became crispy, then tossed with a delicious pomodoro sauce and served with 3 small veal meatballs that melt in your mouth.  They was some other type of sauce on the bottom that almost tasted like a mole sauce, but became a smoky delicious combo when mixed with the other components.

We were told the wait would be about 5-10 mins.  We got seated around 8pm even though there was an empty seat available around 7.45pm.  They forgot about us, and seemed too busy anyway to try to seat us.  Happens, OK.\n\nThere were a few problems with the management of the place.  First of all, they were doing a HUGE take out order, I want to say in the 30 mins we were waiting, we saw about 15-20 pizza boxes go out the door with Try Caviar.  They were just inundated!  Also, the owner lady (or she seemed like she owned the place) was juggling a gazillion things at once - manning the register, filling up beer pints, opening wine bottles, filling up wine glasses, taking other orders, serving, overseeing the cooking staff.  People in restaurants have different roles to expedite the customer process, this place needs to change!  A lot of small business owners have the tendency to want to micro manage everything, and this is fine if you sit in an office and waste just your time, but a restaurant has customers who don't want to wait forever.\n\nI saw one girl wait for about 15 mins in the front of the resto while we were waiting and then after trying to talk to someone and anyone, but failing to do so and then just walking out of the restaurant.  I would have done the same except we wanted to use our Gilt City coupon.\n\nOnce we sat down, no one came for us.  I had to flag someone down to give us water.  15 mins after we sat down, the owner lady came to take our order.  She saw that we had a coupon and then took 2 of our menus away, since our coupon was only for 2 people.  I expected she was going to bring us the special menu.  She did not come back till 15 mins later.  I was watching her since I was extremely irritated and she was doing all those things I mentioned above.  I flagged a few other staff people down, and at 8.30pm she finally brought us the right menu and we said we were ready to order right away since we were not going to wait another 15 mins to order.  We were going to order from the Gilt City coupon, plus an extra pizza from our friend, but she forced our friend to order an extra appetizer too, and wrote \"policy\" on her notepad because we had a coupon.  I've done this many times where we bring a friend and just make sure we order a nice good entree, so this was shocking to me.  At this point my party was too tired to argue and they just ordered something else.  Had it been just me, I would have either refused or walked out.  I was seriously pissed.\n\nWell, the food came out at a shockingly good pace compared to what we had expected from the experience.  It was good fare, but nothing special.  The house wine was terrible.  Service was horrendous, though the people seemed nice and friendly, but their system just needed a revamp.  I would NEVER go back again.\n\nIf you want decently good food, and don't mind spending a lot of time waiting, knock yourself out and go to Mozzeria.\n\nShort addendum: someone told me I should mention that a number (or maybe all?) of the people working at this establishment were deaf, I did not want to mention that and sound like a bigot, but maybe I should.  I feel like this in general this could slow down the process a bit, but it was way more so than it really should have.", "author": "Michelle L."}

The first reservation was canceled by the restaurant without explanation. I figured that it was new and I was willing to give them a pass. However, when I showed up the second time (a full month later) with an OpenTable brunch reservation, the door was locked, the lights were off, and it was clear there was no brunch.

People walking by are courteous and friendly. The waiters don't just smile at you and walk by, they ask how you're doing and actually bring you some cold water to offset the beer.\n\nAnd the food?? We (group of 7 people) ordered a lot-the best way to sample a restuarant's menu all in one-sitting. Everything we ordered was fresh, full of flavor and served at the correct temperature.\n\nPIZZA (1st star): The pizza is thin-crusted with a bubbly outer crust, we had three different pies: Margherita, Quattro Formaggio and Roasted Asparagus. LOVED, LOVED, LOVED it! We emptied our plates, each round. We also shared a pasta dish from the evening specials menu-very fresh and flavorful, this dish also got divoured. Pasta is very fresh and tasty.\n\nSMALL PLATES (2nd star): We had about three different small plates before the pizza came: Rainbow beet salad, House-made burratta and Roasted Japanese Eggplant. Each dish had the right balance of seasonings to bring out and enhance the flavor of the vegetables and cheese. \n\nDESSERTS (3rd star): Oh my, the desserts....we had the: Hazelnut panna cotta, Lemon cheesecake and Bombalino (small donut holes rolled in cinnamon sugar and filled with strawberry jelly with chocolate sauce on the side). I am guilty of hoarding the Bombalino, it was THAT good. \n\nSERVICE (4th star): Both the owner and our waiter were great about making us feel welcome and comfortable. Our waiter checked on our table frequently, we got water refills more than once and didn't have to wait long for additional items (more beer or wine). The waiter had the kitchen cut the pizzas in 8 slices (usually they slice it in 4 or 6) so that we could share easily and brought us another round of clean plates and untensils for our desserts. Good experience!\n\nLOCATION (5th star): Getting there is EASY, 2 blocks away from 16th street Bart going towards the ocean. It's got a big sign at the front and is located on the main street, it's an open treasure you DON'T have to SEARCH for. \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience. My whole group was satisfied and we will definitely return for more. \n\nTip: Be sure to email for a reservation (regardless of your party size) the restaurant is small and fills up fast.", "author": "Foo D."}

But I'm originally from NY (my friend also lives there) and I'm a pizza snob. I would definitely go back. The sauce was amazing- many places have bitter or tasteless sauce.

When we arrived there, the atmosphere was lovely with a brick oven in sight and beautiful light features. We were seated nicely. We ordered a couple pizzas and a mozzeria bar, the restaurant's specialty. The pizzas were UNBELIEVABLY delicious!  The pizzas were presented with fresh mozzarella and basil among the homemade sauce. We had one pizza with duck which is also great. The mozzeria bar was covered with the homemade red sauce and melted cheese inside the bar. That was very good. We were very happy with our food. The service was great, We wish that we were living nearby, as for sure, we will go there often. :-)  I hope that one day, you will open another restaurant in southern California! :)", "author": "Branton S."}

Came for a blackboard eats deal and got no attitude. What a deal! The burrata is truly a standout here. So decadent and delicious. The pizza is perfectly crispy with just the right amount of air bubbles. I love watching them make the pizza from the bar then they take it out of the oven at the perfect time. Pasta was really rich and then the dessert, which was a mix of beignet and churro, was delicious as well.

Jason and I are huge fans of peking duck, so we went to sate our craving. We we arrived at 7 for our reservations, we were seated promptly. We glazed over the menu and decided to have one pizza and a couple of appetizers. The beat salad was ok, I have to say that the goat cheese on the salad was pretty much the only thing memorable on the salad. We also ordered the crispy pork, which was not crispy at all, but definitely had the right flavor profiles with white bean puree and the seasoning of the pork.\n    After our appetizers came our pizza which was decent, but we were really hoping for a crisp duck skin add that crunch factor, but it just wasn't there. Still finding ourselves hungry ordered 1 slider @ $3 and shared the small bite. The slider was the best item on the menu out of all the other items we had for the evening including dessert. Don't waste your time with dessert. Save your money walk the 2 extra blocks and have some killer ice cream at bi-rite.\n   All in all it was just meh. I give them the benefit of the doubt that they have only been open for 6 months, I mean the flavors are all there, but the execution is wanting.

Our BART train was late, so we arrived about 15 minutes after our reserved time. They still held our table for us, and everyone was very nice. \n\nWe ordered the Mozzeria bar, which I didn't think was amazing. It wasn't super hot, and I can imagine if it were, it would have been much better. I'd have liked the sauce in a cup on the side instead of splattered all over, since it made the crust soggy and unappetizing. \n\nWe ordered the duck pizza and the pancetta pizza. The crust on the pancetta pizza was burned, which made it not as delicious as I'm sure it could have been. The duck pizza was perfectly done, and it was absolutely fantastic, although it would have been nice to have more pieces of duck on it, or an option to pay more to add extra meat? We were both full after the pizza, so we passed on dessert.\n\nThe service was good, considering that they were crazy busy, although we did have to wait a while for the appetizer, which was a drag, since I could see it sitting on the bar cooling off when I would have liked to be burying my fork in it. The pizzas came out nice and hot though.\n\nI was a little disappointed with the burned pizza, but I figure.. hey, it's their second day of business. Give them a little time, they're going to get it right. I also think the crust would benefit from a sprinkling of salt on the bottom. This prevents it from burning, and also gives it more flavor.

Both times I came on crowded weekend nights, and I didn't have to wait past my scheduled reservation time.  Service was nice and friendly, and on my second visit the owner recognized us and welcomed us back.  \n\nBoth times we had the Mozzeria bar--delicious!  On our first visit we shared the Italian sausage pizza.  I had, when reading the description, been wary of \"white garlic sauce,\" but it was delicious.  The crust was super thin and the toppings were flavorful.  On our second visit, we shared the roast duck pizza--it was fantastic!  It would have never occurred to me to imagine a pizza with duck and Hoisin sauce.  I'm glad someone else imagined it and created it.  \n\nThe desserts sounded wonderful, but both times, we were so full from dinner we couldn't even contemplate dessert.  And there's no way I'm giving up that Mozzeria Bar appetizer to save room for dessert!  Maybe make a future dessert-only trip, or get it to go....\n\nParking is about what you would expect for that neighborhood, so be sure to allow extra time.

The salads were very fresh -- could use some seasoning or more flavorful dressing, but still good. The pizzas were naan-like; very chewy and thin crust. We enjoyed them and there was plenty of duck on our pizza. The only item I probably would not order again is the meatball appetizer. They tasted fine but there were only 3 fairly small meatballs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-04-30", "description": "I would like to have two separate ratings (one for food and one for the lighting environment).  We were there last Saturday and their food was GREAT (no acid in tomato sauce) and would give them the rating of 5. However, with our advice to them way in advance of our special needs - very well light spot to enable DeafBlind (only those who still can see well in well light spots due to their NIGHT blindness, especially DB with Usher's or RP). The ceiling light was not good and hard to see everyone on the table even tho they tried the best.  Our suggestion to owners is 1) install LED 120-watt light bulbs for ceiling lights (each bulb uses only 15 watts) as well as have two task light battery operated lamps on the table to enable those DB to see everyone chat and enjoy the whole time of dining.  It is fortunate that they have the plug outlet under the table to use for prolonging the battery life.  The rating for the lighting environment is 1. So, the average of both food rating and lighting rating is 3.  Hope owners will be doing something about ceiling lights and task light lamps (can be purchased on JoFabrics website, they are not expensive with 40 or 50 percent discount at times).

We had a gilt city voucher which I presented and had no problem with redeeming -- they gave us the special menu for the voucher. We ordered the burrata and the mozzeria bar as appetizers. The housemade burrata was delicious and it was accompanied with deep fried dough which was different from other places and it was quite tasty and worked well. The mozzeria bar was basically a flattened, large mozzarella stick with a marinara moat, which was was excellent in our book. We ordered the spinach pizza and the margherita pizza. The real standout was the crust -- perfectly chewy, fluffy and crisp. The margherita was a solid pizza and we were pleasantly surprised that the vegan spinach pizza had great flavor and satisfied. We finished with the bombolini dessert which was executed well but we didn't like the flavor. The house red wine was standard. As you know, the restaurant is a deaf owned and operated establishment, which was neat. The service and ambiance were great and it was a fun weeknight date spot. We would recommend this place and would come back in the future.", "author": "T K."}

We had no idea that it is operated by hearing-impaired staff, and the level of service and quality of dinning experience we received was actually better than many other restaurants we have visited. The pizza was cooked to perfection, with just the right level of flavor imparted from the wood burning oven. The salads and pasta were also both so good we wanted to go back for more even the very next day. We're counting on this place to be our regular go-to spot from now on.", "author": "Eric S."}

I think I had the best meatballs I've ever eaten last night. \nThe space is unassuming but still comfortable and well-designed. But the food is the star. The pizza was excellent. The crust was slightly charred, thin but still elastic with just the right amount of chewiness, with tomato sauce and cheese that were just right by East Coast standards--tomatoes not too sweet, cheese not overpowering everything else--something that SF struggles with (yes, even you, Tony's Napoletana).  The gnocchi with veal meatballs was outrageously good! I used pizza crust to clean every bit of sauce off my plate.  Ditto the pea tendril salad with hazelnuts, blue cheese and mango. And dessert! The lightest cheesecake with a beautiful lemon sauce, almost like a lemon curd. Delectable!  And the staff is fantastic! Very friendly and warm and unpretentious-- Mark was our waiter and he was awesome.  We will go back over and over and over and........", "author": "Emme D."}

We were all very excited about our first Deaf restaurant experience! The place was packed and although we had to wait a bit for a table we didn't mind since we were treated with complimentary wine from the owner Melody. My husband and I are hearing and we noticed the music was pleasant (not too loud) and added to the nice ambiance. It was very exciting for all of us that everyone we encountered were fluent in ASL. Our server was a CODA (hearing Child Of Deaf Adult) and it was exciting for my Deaf in laws to be able to order in ASL! Melody the owner even mentioned that she may add ASL music videos to the flat screen TV at the bar in order to sync the audio music and visual ASL. Sounds great! The pizza was delicious! I ordered the eggplant yum! Everyone's food smelled and looked great! I am so happy that this wonderful Deaf owned restaurant is right here in SF! I hope many hearing people will come and try the great pizza and learn a bit about Deaf culture! I plan to go again soon!", "author": "Alicia S."}

The food was delicious and the customer service was amazing.  The only thing I think they need to improve is kids.  There is no kid's menu and my daughter had to drink water from glass cup (plastic cups with lids would be better).  Keep up the good work!

The service is really incredible and the atmosphere is great. Unfortunately the food just didn't really wow me. I've had better wood oven pizza for a lesser price.  The crust is awesome, but the ratio of toppings is a little out of whack. The bleu cheese pizza was a bit overpowered by the cheese (and I'm a huge bleu cheese fan) and the roast duck pizza was more like a few pieces of duck on some really tasty toast (very little sauce, other toppings weren't much of a compliment).  I'll probably go back just because I liked the atmosphere and the people.", "author": "Alex N."}
