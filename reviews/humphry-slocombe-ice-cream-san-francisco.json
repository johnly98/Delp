I have to say, for a city that's always got me teetering on the brink of chilly and sweaty, the folks here know ice cream really well.\n\nHumphry Slocombe has an exemplary staff that makes the best treats. I love that half their case rotates with the seasons. Being able to purchase pints of their most iconic flavors is also a plus. And honestly, who doesn't feel happy nibbling on mouthfuls of sugary delight while sitting on an old-timely stool?\n\nThis is one of the best places to take family and friends in town. It's got decent variety in dairy-free flavors, and all their ice cream is ultra-pasteurized, making it safe for pregnant women (we asked). Everyone who works here is courteous and knowledgeable about the products, so it's an excellent introduction into artisanal ice cream. \n\nThe best flavors (in my humble opinion) are the Vietnamese coffee and blueberry boy bait. Both are delightfully sweet without causing a toothache. Plus, they're twists on classic ice cream flavors that speak volumes to how creamy good ice cream can become, and they fill the need for comforting flavors when you're having a bad day. It's the best pick for scooped ice cream in this part of town.", "author": "Gwen W."}

My interest was piqued by the unique flavors, that have equally as interesting names, so I decide to ordered 6 pints from Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream off Goldbely. Considering the ice cream was shipped to me, I was surprised by how wonderful the texture and flavors were! \n\nHere's the scoop (pun intended) on what I got...\n\nMatchadoodle: Not as matcha-y as I had hoped but I'm a matcha-holic.\nThe snickerdoodle cookie overwhelmed the subtle amount of matcha but not in a bad way. It was just not what I had imagined. Still delightful but mellower than I had hoped. \n\nSecret Breakfast: The signature flavor that is not-so-secret anymore. It's amazing and delicious! I never knew I wanted bourbon and cornflake ice cream but now that I've had it I can't imagine not having it. If you only try one make it this one!!\n\nDirty Chai: Being a chai tea fan I thought this pint would be one of my favorites, but turns out the opposite was true. The spices were just too overwhelming for me. Obviously they need to be prominent because of the espresso but it was just not my cup of tea...literally. Ha! \n\nBlueberry Boy Bait: This flavor was interesting. Lately, I've become more of a blueberry fan but the ice cream had a different taste that I couldn't pinpoint. I looked at the ingredients list and the last two listed are red wine vinegar and balsamic vinegar. Perhaps they are for color but the curious flavor I couldn't discern probably comes from the vinegars. \n\nHoney Graham: My second favorite of the bunch. Subtle enough to please vanilla fans out there but different enough to please more adventurous flavor lovers too! Tastes kind of like teddy graham cookie or a delicious graham cracker pie crust mixed throughout a good solid flavored honey base. \n\nTahitian VN!LL@*: It's vanilla but not thanks to a little extra pop from malt powder. This one is great on top of pie or a fresh baked crumble hot out of the oven! \n\nIt is easy to see why Humphry Slocombe wins award after award in the gourmet ice cream world!

I enjoyed Smitten's and Bi-Rite, but I will have to say that Humphry's has its own speciality that differentiates themselves between the other two. \n\nOne of the reason why I like this place was because they have a variety of exotic flavors. Flavors that you can't find at anywhere else. Some of the options that they come up with are mind boggling but if it sells then something is definitely worth mentioning. \n\nI opted for a flavor that had coconut in it.

Secret breakfast (rum with some cereal mixed in, but I wouldn't have guessed it was cereal!) on top of psychedelic city on a cone. No complaints (except don't put those two together haha, my bad). \n\nI can't say enough about the secret breakfast. I would say it's a MUST if you come to the city because it's so flipping unique!! The rum is subtle and adds depth. The ice cream itself is delicious, but on the lighter side (unlike bi-rite and salt&straw). The ice cream is perfect in texture.... when you bite into it you still have to lick it because it runs the tiniest bit.

I really like that the flavors are rich--not the texture of the ice cream itself, but the taste. There is more dimension than sweetness which I really enjoy about Humphry Slocombe's ice cream. The Secret Breakfast was most memorable for me from my first visit, and I got it as a sample this time. I love that it has a crunch to it from the corn flakes they add. Apparently it's like eating cereal and milk for breakfast, but I feel like it's more than that, and it's something you just have to experience rather than read about it from a review. I opted to pass on Secret Breakfast this time. The first flavor my friend and I chose was the Oatlandish, which has a beer-y finish to it. There was also a fat cookie piece in the ice cream which made it hard to bite, but it was still good. The ice cream itself was a bit on the icy side, but I enjoyed the taste. My favorite of the two flavors I got had to be the the Harvey milk and honey. The honey taste was pretty strong, and it was almost like having a honey stick dissolved into milk. It was very pleasant and almost refreshing. \n\nService was very friendly, and the lady helping us was very accommodating in letting us try as many flavors as we pleased. The store itself is small, but there are seats both inside and out. Since it was a weekday, it wasn't too crowded. I love that you can take home pints of ice cream--it would definitely be cheaper that way. Our two scoops cost $6.50, which is pretty pricey, but worth it.

The line for Humphry was extremely long, but the employees were time-efficient and the line moved quickly. \n\nFlavor selection: The flavors were very creative, and they weren't unique simply to stand out. The ingredients in the flavors I tried paired well together to form an amazing tasting experience. I tried a couple different flavors (Duet and McEvoy Olive Oil & Rhubarb) before I ultimately settled on the Cinnamon Tres Leches, single scoop in a cone. \n\nCinnamon Tres Leches: The ice cream was delicious. It was jam-packed with cinnamon and had chunks of yellow cake, which added some texture to the dessert. It was sweet, but not overpowering. The cone was crunchy and tasty as well; not your standard cone from the grocery aisle. \n\nEnvironment: It's a little difficult to find an area to sit down and enjoy the ice cream, but my friends and I found a couple empty spots on a bench behind the Ferry Building, overlooking the bay and the ferries. \n\nPrice: The price was a little steep for ice cream, it's $4.50 for a single scoop. But for the specialty flavor and the location, it just might be worth it. Next time I visit San Francisco, I'll be sure to come back for more. \n\nPS.

Since it was beer week I got the Mango Sour and a Rye beer flavor. Neither flavor was as strong as the beer flavors from last year but still very tasty. The mango sour was a little sour with a kick of salt. It was a nice pairing with the Rye beer that was a bit sweeter almost chocolatey w/ almost a grain aftertaste (not in texture). They were both delicious. The only reason I knocked off a star is cause the texture was pretty bad.

Most recently I tried a caramel and vanilla with chocolate-covered potato chips.  The ice cream was alright, but why the potato chips instead of, I don't know, cookie bits or chocolate chips?

I drove here from Antioch, based on what i saw from a tv show this was like top 10 icecream parlors in the USA so i being the foodie that i am said I'll take my girlfriend here as a cute little date. Turned out to be a complete and uttter failure based on the customer service from a lady that was kind of on the huskier side if im not mistaken she had like red hair.

Theres like 2 to 4 tables outside for seating im not too familiar with this area of sf but parking wasnt hard to find at least it wasnt for me. We saw some unique flavors which we wanted to try but i knew what I'd come for. The birthday cake flavor, not sure if thats what it's actually called but you know what i mean. The lady was first to ask how could she help us we werent sure so she dished us off to the gentlemen standing to her right as she aggressively proceeded to handle us but the caucasian hetero couple behind us she seemed nice and sincere. My initial thought was she didn't like black people, i then thought maybe she doesnt like gay people. Maybe she doesnt like indecisive people, maybe it was the end of her shift and she was ready to go, maybe she had a rough day... its ok people have them. I then thought maybe she hates her job, or maybe she's menstruating, or maybe just maybe she doesnt like working with that particular coworker. Either way i should never have to feel unwelcomed to some where i drove over an hour to just to indulge in 5 min worth of icecream. This would be the first time i say this ever but i hope shes no longer there. Its been about a year since ive come here and when my girlfriend said they've opened up a new one in oakland it just left a bad taste in my mouth and i could careless.

I had the \"Here's Your Damn Strawberry\" and the Black Sesame and the flavors were amazingly rich and fresh and full of heavy cream decadence. I personally prefer ice cream with less of a heavy taste...but I feel that the ingredients used are high quality here.\n\nA single scoop will set you back $4.50 while 2 scoops will cost $6.75. This is cheaper than if you order from their mobile truck. Pints go for $10. $10?! Definitely the most expensive pint of ice cream IMO. It'll cost you $11 if you order it online for delivery.\n\nWe ended up sampling like most of their flavors but the gal helping us out was very helpful and exuded good customer service. \n\nOverall, convenient location, great flavors, fresh ingredients, but pricey. It's an SF institution though so I don't think the price is going to deter anyone. Definitely a place for dessert if you're walking around the Mission after dinner!", "author": "Sam L."}

It's not quite on the same level of notoriety as *that other* ice cream spot in The Mission, but it certainly must be discussed in the same conversation. \n\nHaving been to this town and this neighborhood several times in my life and never trying HS, I felt like I wasn't really, truly living my potential as an urban explorer of the lacto-dessert order.

Shortly thereafter, a small party of three arrived in line behind me, but I actually let them go first so I could look at the selection.\n\nEveryone will talk about Secret Breakfast and you should probably get that (it's whiskey and cereal) but I didn't. It just wasn't my night to try a whiskey ice cream. Instead, I went with three flavors: Elotes, Brulee Fig & Creme Fraiche, and Peach & Blackberry Cobbler. Right off the bat, I knew the fig would be the winner. It had big enough chunks to understand it was true fig, but it was the best texture and the best flavor composition. Really well done. The cobbler was good, but probably needed a little more punch to offset the sweetness. I love berries for that reason, so maybe a little more berry would have kicked it up. And I swung hard and missed on Elotes. I wish it had more flavor. I would have welcomed a rich corn flavor, but instead got the light dusting of chili and not much else. Not every ice cream needs to knock you out and with a creative flavor like elote there's a real risk of overdoing it, but it came off and underdone. These are the risks you take as a nighttime conechaser, and I don't regret trying it. But I'd for sure try new flavors next time.\n\nAfter I had been there a bit and was about halfway through my dish, a line did start to form.

It was okay because it gave us a chance to walk around and explore. We came back about 15 minutes before they were set to open. Us and another couple sat outside waiting. It wasn't quite 1:00, but other folks just walked right in and suddenly they were open and we had to stand in line when... well, we'd been there a while. So we had to wait and we also lost our outside table. I was annoyed at the process, but it didn't keep me from enjoying my ice cream! We ended up grabbing two of the six ice cream parlor stools inside the store to enjoy our dessert.\n\nI had one scoop of Surprise Breakfast. I didn't know until later it was bourbon ice cream with corn flakes. All I knew was it was delicious. It melted beautifully and had the perfect feel in my mouth... not to mention a delectable sweet taste. \n\nIn the store there is one garbage can marked 'compost only'. I wondered what we would do with our ice cream cup and spoon. Well, the spoon was made out of something (I don't remember, but it actually said on the spoon and it was clear to me the spoon was biodegradable). And the cup was too, so both went into the compost only can. Very earth friendly.\n\nI'm from Cincinnati and I couldn't help but think of Graeters as I was eating my Surprise Breakfast. As good as Humphry Slocombe is, it (and most any other ice creamery) pales in comparison to Graeters. \n\nBut since I'm not in Cincinnati, I am a definite fan of Humphry Slocombe!", "author": "Scott N."}

You can still see the flecks of black mixed into the ice cream so you know you've definitely gotcher self the read deal. What really brings this one above and beyond for me was the fact that the base ice cream was not some plain vanilla...but rather a mellowed out version of something like salted caramel!

If I could buy this flavor on the regular.......man, oh, MAN! \n\nJasmine lychee- Strong on the tea at first. So much so that it feels almost like it's going to stay a really heavy flavor (like some chai)...but then it turns around back into the realm of lychee...great soft tropical finish!\n\nAm I the only one that is vaguely surprised (in a happy way) that they don't charge extra for a waffle cone?

Here's the deal: I did visit Polly Ann's in 2009. My faint recollection is that it was good, but not truly excellent. I also drove up in 2012 to help some foodie friends tour the City by the Bay. They didn't plan an ice cream stop though, and I didn't object because I figured that I would get a chance to go back sooner or later. Unfortunately, it was more of a later, and it was an opportunity created by heading up a little early before attending some other friends' wedding reception.\n\nI arrived at Humphry Slocombe at about 4:40pm on a Saturday. Considering the praise that they get, the line was shockingly short! Five minutes (after the drive and such) to get to the counter is such a huge plus. I don't know whether it was the time of day, the speed of service, the lack of a huge sign with their name on it, or some criminal underrating by the residents of SF, but I was so happy. This was amplified when I realized how long some of the lines at other top-notch spots can be, reportedly at all times of day too.\n\nSeeing that one scoop is $4 and two are $6, I found that the $7.50 option for three scoops would provide the best value and variety (other than going pint-sized for $9, which is kinda ridiculous even for me). I didn't sample every last flavor on the menu because I felt the eyes of those behind me in line, but I tried enough flavors to make three choices confidently.\n\nThe Nectarine and Plum Yogurt didn't resonate with my palate, so I left it unordered. I probably should have had a scoop of the toast and jam, which was actually fantastic, but I went for the White Miso Peach instead. It was pretty interesting with its slightly savory flavor and peachy accent, but it didn't hit all the right spots for me. The Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee was an obvious choice, and I loved the strong coffee flavor that was not masked by the restrained addition of sugar. Finally, I had to get the renowned Secret Breakfast, and I see why everybody likes it. Although it melted a bit too quickly for my liking, it definitely had a strong bourbon flavor with a \"soft crunch\" from the corn flakes.\n\nThe textures in general are not as thick as some ice creams (in technical terms, there's more overrun), but I'll write it off as a stylistic choice. There weren't unexpected ice crystals or anything else off-putting, although the Coffee flavor did seem to have an evenly distributed icy texture.\n\nI'd easily get the latter two flavors again, but then I'd have to skip out on new experiences. They only have perhaps 16 of their 100+ flavors (listed on their web site) available at once, and I'm sure that they rotate them the time. Now that I've had a lot of experience trying not-so-traditional flavors of frozen dessert, I'm really interested in some of the flavors that I haven't heard of elsewhere. Glenlivet? Prosciutto? Count me in!\n\nSan Franciscans should feel so lucky to have Humphry Slocombe. I'll be back some day, even if I have to skip the other well-known shops. Nah, that's ridiculous - I'll visit multiple shops and include this one. An ice cream tour! That will be the best day ever.", "author": "Chris V."}

I had already decided that I wanted one scoop of the Secret Breakfast long before I came to visit this place. Well I got exactly that and it was pretty good (nothing to write home about), the ice cream was a little icier than I like my ice cream to be but it still had good flavor and is certainly the first time I've ever had cornflakes in my ice cream. My husband of course got what I suppose is the BEST thing on the menu. They had a duck fat pecan pie with brown butter, ice cream sundae. I took one bite and I was in heaven. The brown butter ice cream totally exceeded my expectations. It was super creamy and I could taste actual brown butter, definitely worth a try!

The quirky decor caught our attention! \n\nI shared three scoops with four other friends: peanut butter ripple, blue bottle coffee, and secret breakfast. I'm not a huge fan of peanut butter ice cream, so that was my least favorite. The peanut butter flavor was very strong! The coffee was pretty good, but I prefer coffee ice cream with something else mixed in for texture, like Tin Pot's four barrel coffee with cacao nibs. My favorite was secret breakfast, which had a distinguishable kick of bourbon. Very unique! All three flavors were too sweet for my taste.\n\nIt cost $8.00 for three scoops. I'd definitely recommend sharing to sample more flavors and save money.

Also, the couple of times I have gotten The Secret Breakfast, the ice cream seems to melt very quickly and is very soft.

That's probably the most important aspect with ice cream to me, I just can't really eat it when it's frozen rock hard and lacking.

They were waiting for her to get off the phone to order which was no biggie. The big deal was that they began a conversation for over 7 minutes without even acknowledging the presence of other customers. I have worked in over 10 restaurants and we always at least address the presence of other customers to let them know we see them. They even began to talk about how some people want to taste every flavor to only get vanilla in the end. This is all very funny except we are still not being acknowledged or asked if we knew what we wanted since they did not. They continued to joke around while we fiddled our thumbs salivating. They then apologized for taking so long to her, and they all laughed and she said no worries we are open until 11! Didn't once look at us; And the customer turns around and says, \"Don't worry, he probably won't take until 11 to order.\" I'm sorry but we stood there for at least another 2 minutes suggesting our patience & desire to wait for ice cream to be ignored further and jokes to continue amongst them. It is one of the nicest days in SF and it shouldn't take 10 minutes for an order to be made or the next customers to be addressed. We were the only other people in there patiently waiting to be pompously teased about it. Horrible customer service, I don't care if these people are neighbors. We are too.

I  initially enjoyed the novelty of the flavor but it left a bitter aftertaste. The Peanut Butter Ripple had a strong, sharp taste as well that I enjoyed; the blend of peanut butter and chocolate was very authentic and worked well together. My favorite was definitely the Blue Bottle. Its tampered sweetness really allowed the distinct coffee flavor to shine through and had a much more subtle taste compared to the other two. \n\nOverall, the creaminess and quality of Humphry Slocombe makes it well deserving of its hype.", "author": "Tony P."}

I've chosen this place well, since there's great variety of random flavors.  One of the flavors I like is the Candy Cap, a mushroom flavor as sweet as a maple syrup.  I like to go there sometimes to see Today's flavors.  Few years ago (I don't actually know what year), I tried the fois gras ice cream sandwich for $5 at the Farmer's market outside the Ferry Building.  I tried it once and it taste good, but will never try again.  I like locally grown fruit and vegetable flavors made by scratch, and no artificial flavors, colors, sweeteners, and preservatives.

Having remembered that I had bookmarked this place and read through the weird ingredients and flavors sometime in the past, I instantly ducked in the doorway.\n\nSpace:\nIt's kind of small, but that's to be expected. There's a bar for a couple people to sit and and people watch out the window, but otherwise expect to just head in and out, and not spend too much time in the store itself. The decorations are great: there's a painting with a wrestler on it that caught my eye, and of course the cow head is also intriguing.\n\nService:\nVery friendly workers!

I'm a little sad that I was a bit sick while eating this, so some flavors I couldn't really distinguish (for example, I couldn't really tell what was in Secret Breakfast.) However, I got the Thai Lime Chili Sorbet and my life was changed. It's the equivalent of a papaya salad you'd order at a Thai restaurant (wow, who would've guessed...), but frozen. And magical. It kind of reminded me of nuoc mam, a Vietnamese chili fish sauce dressing, which I love. And if that puts you off, then ignore that description and try it out for yourself, because I promise it is one amazing experience.\n\nSome other flavors I would have liked to get?

I mean, peanut butter curry, balsamic caramel, and mango carrot? Who came up with these absurd flavors?!\n\nWell, that person is a genius. I'm surprised that some of these flavor combinations actually work.\n\nThe ever so popular two-flavor combination, Secret Breakfast and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, make a wonderful duo. Secret Breakfast is very milky and the sweet cornflakes add a nice crunch, but the Bourbon is hardly noticeable. Vietnamese Coffee is rich and creamy, and is definitely one of my favorites!\n\nThe Carrot Mango Sorbet is a strange, yet interesting combination. The carrot flavor is much more prominent than the mango flavor. The overall texture is smooth, not icy, that I could've mistaken myself for eating healthy a vegetable-fruit puree rather than a dessert.\n\nThe Jesus Juice is a wonderful pairing of wine and cola in sorbet-form. Who'd knew these two would pair so nicely, yet taste the two flavors individually.\n\nService is very friendly and quick. They're very generous with giving out samples. The shop is small and cramped with only six stools inside and a few tables and chairs outside. It's very simplistic-looking from the outside, so this shop could be easily missed.

Not only do the employees move you along the line with minimal fuss and maximum efficiency, they get down to the ghetto tones of our youth. The vibe is the complete opposite of Ici in Berkeley - and I dig. \n\nIt seems like many great ice cream shops these days have a few things in common (with the exception of Smitten):\n- The Flavor Wall - a rotating selection of unique signatures (Prosciutto?) and classics (complete list found at http://www.humphryslocombe.com/www.humphryslocombe.com/Flavor_List.html)\n- Samplings - you can't know before you know, ya know? Just make sure your spoon makes it into the \"Dirty Spoons\" can. \n- Paraphernalia - in this case, mugs with the twin calf-heads. And soon, the official Humphry Slocombe book!\n- Nibbles - sweet little munchies you can eat by themselves from the package or on top of your ice cream.\n- A Line - self explanatory. But actually, not bad, and by the time we were done eating there was none. \n- $$ - unfortunately, this is no $1 soft serve joint (ILY McDonald's). \n\nI only sampled the Secret Breakfast (bourbon and corn flakes, yes!) and Golden Beet Saffron (meh) flavors, but my ice cream senses were telling me to get the Szechuan Strawberry (yes!) and Jasmine Lychee (YASS). Good thing I brought a friend. In order of my preference:\nJasmine Lychee -- Secret Breakfast -- Szechuan Strawberry -- Blue Bottle Vietnamese Iced Coffee -- ... -- Golden Beet Saffron\nThe flavors are surprisingly true to their names, so if you LOVE Blue Bottle coffee,  or jasmine tea / lychee fruit, I will guarantee you will love that ice cream. Szechuan Strawberry earned an eyebrow raise from my friend, but it's like Strawberry sorbet BUT 10X BETTER. Pretty sure there's crack in here. It's gives you a delicious kick at the end of each bite and does NOT taste like mala sauce.

Plus what I love about this place is that you can look at their recipes, and all of them contain really simple ingredients, so you know you're getting the freshest, creamiest ice-cream with no preservatives or crazy chemicals.\n\n1. Secret Breakfast - Bourbon icecream with cornflakes. I really loved the texture of the cornflakes, it tasted like a crunchy graham crackers. The bourbon flavor of the ice-cream was a little overwhelmed by the salt for me but it's definitely an interesting and yummy flavor.\n\n2. McEvoy Olive Oil Ice-Cream : This was delicious which surprised me because I'm not a fan of olive oil! But the ice creamwas really light and citrusy. I could eat this all day\n\n3. Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee - SO GOOD. Just downright addictive and delicious. It was basically coffee in a creamy dream. Our friend bought a pint of it the second he tasted it.\n\n4. Strawberry Szechuan - It tasted like very good strawberry sorbet which was a little disappointing as I was hoping for some heat.\n\nOverall Humphry Slocombe is a real gem! I love all their inventive flavors and their super delicious execution :) Definitely my favorite artisan ice cream place in the city.", "author": "Sarah T."}

Ice cream is, after all, our favorite food. \n\nThe young guy behind the counter was so sweet! He joked around with us and gave us big tastes of many of the flavors. He made both of us giggle and really put the cherry on top of our ice cream experience. \n\nI've been to the shop in the ferry building and knew that Humphry Slocombe ice cream is so creamy and filling that you really only need the small size (yes this is coming from someone for whom a single serving of ice cream is typically a pint).\n\nI chose horchata rose (OMG) and my sister chose the Tahitian vanilla bean. Wow. I'd previously had the malted milk ball flavor and the Harvey Milk graham flavor but these two really shined with how simple and elegant they were. \n\nI'd highly recommend getting a pint of the Tahitian vanilla bean for like, anything - pumpkin pie, late night snack, dinner party.

But tonight I showed up at HS on Harrison and they were out of 1/3 of their flavors including Secret Breakfast. WTF? How can you possibly be out of your signature ice cream? Does Thomas Keller run out of salmon tartare? Does Momofuku run out of pork buns? Does In-n-Out run out of \"animal style\"?\n\nSo is that worth a one star review? Heavens no. But given that the one guy behind the counter was not only wildly surly, but was clearly sick complete with giant sniffles while his head was inside the ice cream case and half-covered sneezes everywhere else, I'm afraid the single dinger is well earned. I'm far from squeamish and will eat substances that others consider horrifying but this wasn't just a little cold. It was a get-into-bed-and-heat-up-some-chicken-soup sick. \n\nSeriously, that is not only gross but it is going to get people sick. Get your act together, Humphrey Slocombe.

We figured we had arrived. We lined up behind them, peeked and tried to make out the horrible penmanship written on a chalkboard hung on the wall. Listed were the ice cream flavors they had for the day. Some were crossed out meaning it was sold out. Thankfully the two I desperately wanted to try was still available.

Didn't really like it because I don't like chocolate ice cream and it was too salty] tasted like.\n\nSecret Breakfast [corn flakes+bourbon]: It was yummy! A little too sweet for me (that's odd!). I really enjoyed the crunchy texture of the corn flakes and the hint of bourbon in the ice cream.\n\nBlue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee: I really enjoyed this one!! It's more of a rich and dark flavor opposed to the previous one.\n\nBourbon float $5 [Secret Breakfast+bourbon+coke]: what a deal! They provide you with the bottle of coke that they used for the float. Someone from my party got this and said it was good! I didn't think they would add more bourbon liquor, but apparently they did.

But don't get it twisted, I will still keep it honest and real as I am know for :) I shouldn't even be giving them 5 stars honestly because I applied to work here, had a great interview and the stupid SOB's never hired me. They better be lucky I like the ice cream.\n\nSomeone else on here said it's hard to rate ice cream, and I have to whole-heartedly agree. I've been to quite a few more local places that were supposed to be so \"good\" and turned out to be overrated--Loard's ice cream being the most overrated of them. But Humphry Slocombe actually gets ice cream right, and even gets it right better than Coldstone. Coldstone used to be somewhat of a favorite, but their ice cream became generic in a sense, and didn't store well after the mix-ins. Plus it tasted weird just after like a day being in the freezer. Humphrey's actually can be somewhat compared to your favorite store-bought ice cream as far as quality. What I mean by that is you can REGULARLY go for Humphry's as you would like Dreyer's. If it were sold in stores I probably would always get it. \n\n1a) That name Humphry Slocombe is just not cutting it. I read the history of the name, but still, it has to go. Too awkward to read and say, and doesn't make much sense. it sounds like a Tax Preparer Service place, or a tailoring service. Actually, it really sounds like a place to do stock trading lmao. I will be the first one to vote if they ever changed the name.\n\n1b) But once you get over the name, you can focus on the ice cream better. The texture and the flavors of the ice just mesh all too well. Other ice cream parlors of course are a hit and miss when it comes to finding the right blend of texture and flavor, but Humphry hits the nail right. My favorite so far is the Harvey Milk, and also the Chocolate Malt one. Their vanilla for the Harvey Milk is one of the creamiest vanilla's I've had yet; and is almost better than Haagan Daaz or Ben & Jerry's vanilla (and that's saying a lot). The graham pieces don't get overly soggy when the ice cream melts as other brands of ice cream may do, it stays edible and very delicious. The Secret Breakfast is somewhat reminiscent of Frosted Flakes and the flakes also don't get too soggy. \n\n2) Usually I NEVER buy the expensive pre-packed pints from these types of places, however Humphry's is the ONLY place I buy the pre-packed pints, and I highly recommend you do as well. I do it to skip the line, and because the quality of ice cream in the pints are really the same great quality in the regular big freezer for the scoops. And at $9/pint it better be worth it. The 3-scoop would average out to almost the same price and volume as the pint anyway in my opinion, if they were packed tight. \n\n3)They need to open more locations. Very annoying all a sudden \"everyone and they mama\" (that's slang, look it up) comes out of nowhere at the SAME TIME to cram the small shop, and block the doorway. The patrons usually are pretty snobby and rude so if you're going just to get the pints, don't be scared to bumrush past them after saying excuse me twice when they aren't listening to you because they are too busy engaging in stupid-topic convos thinking they are the only people in line getting ice cream, as they block the doorway. Shouldn't it be a fire hazard to block the door anyway? Humprhy should really get on that and enforce doorway space there. \n\nCongrats Humphry Slocombe for probably being the only business to get 5-stars outta me.", "author": "Marquis A."}

Even for me, some of the flavors were actually pretty gross and a little off putting (Thai Chili Lime- spicy ice cream is just weird, Salt & Peppa - very strange). But the flavors that are good are REALLY good.\n\nThe consistency of pretty much all of the flavors is the best and what really makes this place awesome. It is so perfectly smooth and creamy.\n\nNow on to specifics, and the flavors I tried:\n- Secret Breakfast (Bourbon & Corn Flakes):\nAt first it is weird, but I told myself I should try more than just a sample and get a full scoop, and I did not regret it. You can definitely taste the alcohol in it, which actually works, and every now and then you get a nice crunch from some of the corn flakes.\n\n- Harvey Milk & Honey Graham:\nThis is great too and is a little more of a normal flavor that can appeal to more people (like my wife, who I sampled it from).\n\n- Malted Milk Chocolate:\nThis is also a very plain flavor, but was some of the best chocolate ice cream I've ever had.\n\n- Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee:\nThe best coffee ice cream I've ever had. As I said before, the ice cream here is so smooth and goes down so easily you don't realize you just ate a couple ounces of pure cream and fat.\n\n- Thai Chili Limi:\nPass...the idea of spiciness and a hot sensation in your mouth when eating ice cream on a hot day just does not appeal to me.\n\n- Tahitian Vanilla:\nAnother very vanilla flavor, but again, one of the best renditions of the flavor that I have ever tried.\n\nAs for the shop itself, I was lucky enough to not have to wait in too long a line so I only had to endure listening to some hipsters discussing food snobbery for a few minutes.

Secret Breakfast is a crowd favourite.  Harvey Milk is exquisite milk and honey-infused ice-cream textured with chewable graham crumble. They've done an artisanal take on Strawberry.

The blue bottle vietnamese coffee is really delicious, but pretty strong flavoured so I'm not sure I would be able to eat an entire scoop of it. The secret breakfast is also in the same boat...it's good but since the bourbon flavour is really strong I think I would be overwhelmed by an entire scoop. The coconut sorbet tasted pretty standard.\n\nThis review is ONLY for the mango sorbet. I sampled it, and I liked the way it tasted so I decided to get one scoop. I shared the scoop with a friend and we couldn't finish it. The more we ate, the more we felt this salty after-taste which overpowered the sweetness of the mango.\n\nI didn't like the mango sorbet but I'm sure the they have other flavours that I would like a lot more. Humphry Slocombe seems to have a lot of unconventional flavours so I'm excited to come back and try something new.", "author": "Theresa L."}

I've also tried the poppy flavor and Jesus juice sorbet and have been equally pleased. There's truly no hit and miss when enjoying a frozen treat here at Humphry's Slocombe.\n\nLocated in a quiet Mission neighborhood, the surroundings are perfect for a laid back vibe when enjoying your sweet treat amongst the outdoor seating. \n\nI tend to be a little monotonous in my flavor profile and enjoy having the same things over and over, but after venturing out a bit and trying out the new ice cream flavorings here, I'm convinced that there's absolutely no wrong choice!\n\nAlways friendly and quick service!", "author": "Ann S."}

Think frosted corn flakes that have become soggy in a bourbon flavored ice cream .

The street is full of wanderers and homeless people.  \n\nWe came right before a horde of people came in and bombarded this small ice cream place.  We got two scoops of ice cream in a cup- one Tahitan vanilla, and the other the Secret breakfast.  I felt the Secret Breakfast tried to be too unique. The bourbon flavor overpowered all.  I am a simple kind of guy.  Vanilla did the trick of pleasing my taste buds just right.  \n\nI would come back to this place again.  It is way better than Bi-Rite, and less crowded for sure.  Waiting in line (at Bi-Rite) to get ice cream is just ridiculous.  Bi-Rite either needs a bigger store, faster staff, or more cash registers open.  After all, it is just ice cream.  They should be conducting a transaction every 30 seconds or less.", "author": "Victor L."}

Came by on a Tuesday afternoon, and the line was WAAAAAAYYY out the door.  After a 45 minute wait, we were greeted with a cordial staff and knowing there was a long line behind me, felt I should rush to taste and decide on my flavors.  But the staff didn't seem to rush me at all and I tired a few before deciding.  The samples were very generous, btw.  \n\nSecret Breakfast tasted like cornflakes and some captain crunch cereal, the Earl Grey Plumb was a beautiful verdant plum and  delicious sorbet.  The Dulce de Leche was good, but too sweet for me.  I ended up with the Vietnamese Coffee and Salted Chocolate.  I thought they were good, however 1 - the Vietnamese Coffee was nowhere close to being a Vietnamese coffee, which as we know, is very strong and borderline bitter.  It was just not strong or bitter enough.  2 - the Salty Chocolate was too sweet and maybe just a tad too salty.  I am one who does happen to like the sweet/salty combo (people either like it or they don't), but I didn't think the flavors on this could have been better balanced.\n\nI love that they use organic Strauss Dairy for their products, however, Bi-Rite still tops my ice cream list.  I find Bi-Rite to be creamier and has a cleaner finish.  The staff is great, and portions are decent.  Pricing is competitive with other artisan crafted ice creams.  The most painful thing about Humphry's??  The LOOOONG wait!  Other than that you can't go too wrong!

Or at least that's the impression I got on my last visit to the city when I finally got to chow down on some of this renowned gelato. With my work crew in tow, we opted for a gelato night cap and trundled into the Harrison St gelateria all wide-eyed at the flavours combos abound. I ended up with a classic Blue Bottle ice-coffee flavour in a cone but could have easily been swayed towards the Matilda (cake, biscuits and chocolate) or the secret breakfast mix of cornflakes and bourbon. Suffice to say decisions must be made but thankfully they let you sample a few to make sure you're committing to the best for you at that time.", "author": "Lani P."}

My friend recommended this place but man, it was a journey getting here. \n\nComing from Ike's in Danville, we wanted to get an ice cream fix so we took in the sights on the way to the Mission District. I dig the area but unfortunately for my parking efforts, Carnaval was happening so parking became an issue. We eventually found a spot further away but hey, we got to take in the Mission and the festival so it was a win-win. \n\nAfter a couple blocks' trek, we found ourselves outside Humphrey Slocombe's open doors and took great care in deciding what we wanted knowing that it would be a while before we could return. I settled on the Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee and the secret breakfast. \n\nMan oh man. The Vietnamese coffee tasted like Vietnamese coffee but it was the perfect mix of the strength of Vietnamese coffee and sweetness of ice cream that just made it mmmmazing. The secret breakfast was on point too! The same balance between the bourbon (oops, not so secret anymore) and the sweetness made it unique and flavorful.\n\nNot so delicious was the price.

I ordered the oolong ice cream based on a friends recommendation but not before doing my own research. I sampled the secret breakfast and jesus juice flavors as well. Both were good (and somewhat alcoholic) but I decided to stick with the oolong. \n\nLike any ice cream shop, Humphry's rotates flavors in and out depending on season and what's available. The weekend I went was Pride Weekend and they had run out of the Harvey Milk flavor due to pure demand. It looked like they had 16 out at any given point and I'm willing to bet there's about 8-10 that are hiding in the back. Definitely coming back here to try them all.", "author": "Philip W."}

We've wanted to try the ice cream at Humphry Slocombe for years now. I'm glad we finally went here.  \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nThe place is pretty small but then again it's an ice cream place. When you walk in you'll see the menu posted on the wall with the ice cream flavors listed. There's a few seats available inside. Directly in front of Humphry Slocombe and down the street are cement structures. My girlfriend and I sat down on the cement structures and ate our ice cream. I saw a lot of people do the same thing.   \n\nFood:\n\nI ordered a scoop of the Secret Breakfast and Harvey Milk & Honey Graham. Both of the ice creams taste similar but you can distinguish them from one another. The Secret Breakfast tasted really good. It kind of tasted like cereal mixed with a decadent waffle or pancakes with syrup but way better. It had a great flavor. I really liked the Harvey Milk & Honey Graham. It was my favorite. The Honey Graham makes the ice cream taste really good and sweet. It had the perfect balance of sweetness. The texture for both ice creams were very smooth and creamy. \n\nMy girlfriend ordered a scoop of the Fluffnutter and Elvis: Fat Years. She really liked both of the ice creams. She said the Fluffnutter tastes like peanut butter and marshmallow cream and the Elvis: Fat Years tastes like bananas and bacon. I tried a bite of both of them and I really liked the flavors. \n\nService:\n\nThe guy that took our order was very nice. Before I decided what ice cream I wanted he asked me if I wanted to try a sample of a particular ice cream. I thought that was pretty cool (try before you buy).\n\nOverall: \n\nHumphry Slocombe Ice Cream has delicious ice cream and very unique flavors. It's definitely not your typical Ice Cream parlor. It's one of the best ice cream places in my opinion. If you want some good tasty delicious ice cream then Humphry Slocombe is the place for you!", "author": "David R."}

I know he was a little irritated, but he complied and didn't show it off too bad hahahaha! \n\nAnyways, after my sample fest, I decided to order the secret breakfast & cinnamon brittle. Humphry's ice cream is definitely creamy and yummy, and I hate to be one to compare in a review, but Bi-Rite still trumps for me Humphry's obviously would beat out store bought ice cream, but honestly, I didn't find the flavors as prominent as you would in Bi-Rites. It's the same problem I had with Mr. And Mrs. Miscellaneous (except m&mms was worse). Without the comparison to BiRites though, it was still good ice cream. It satisfied the palette. Both flavors were yummy, but I definitely wouldn't get the two TOGETHER because they both had cinnamon in them. It took me sooOOO long to figure out what the secret breakfast was and when I did realize it, it was so obvious! The secret breakfast also had a kick of rum in it, which wasn't evenly dispersed so some bites had WAAAY more rum flavor. Not complaining necessarily, but just saying hahaha. I also definitely liked the CRUNCH factor in both of them The ice cream also may be considered sweet, but who cares, it's ice cream ffs. \n\nHonestly, I don't understand how Humphry's has like 300k followers on Twitter, but it deserves recognition.

In the middle of Sunday afternoon, there was no line and no trouble getting seats at the tables outside the store, which made it nice for us to just sit in the alternating patches of shade and sun to enjoy the ice cream. If you're looking to come here and get your standard sundae or flavors, you're in for a sore surprise - they really do specialize in all sorts of interesting and funky flavors.\n\nMy fiancee and I shared a two-scoop version with Black Sesame and and Harvey Milk & Honey, both of which were extremely delicious. I've had sesame-infused deserts before, but the one thing I liked about the ice cream here is that they maintained the sweetness from the dairy aspect of the ice cream without letting it get overwhelmed by the more savory aspect of the sesame. The milk and honey was also delicious, mainly because it was quite a bit sweeter than I expected - the heavy-handed sweetness of the honey was mellowed down significantly by the milk.\n\nThere are several other flavors I'd love to come back and try, but alas - I don't live in SF, and getting to the Mission when you're an out-of-towner ain't that simple.

It haunted me for days.  In some ways I didn't like it.  It wasn't the super sweet, pure cream, ice cream that I'm used to.  It was almost savory and sweet at the same time.  The more I ate though the more it warmed and cooled me at the same time. \n\nThe shop is tiny and the people are nice.  They use tiny metal spoons for the testing, which you put in a jar for them to wash.  It was nice that they didn't throw away 10,000 plastic spoons a day.  They also use biodegradable dishes I believe.\n\nGo to the website and look at the list, then pray the flavors you want will be there out of the 8-12 in the case.", "author": "Ryan L."}

Not because I loved all of their unique and creative creations; quite the opposite in fact. After sampling roughly six or seven different flavors, and seriously testing the patience of the guy behind the counter, there was not a single flavor that appealed to me enough to want a whole scoop of.\n\nThat is, until I tried my eight flavor -- Secret Breakfast. What is this enigmatic ice cream you ask? It's bourbon and corn flakes. Sure, it's not for everyone, but as a fan of bourbon (and cereal) I was in hooch heaven. And having it in ice cream was like killing two delicious birds with one stone (or scoop). The only problem was that the ice cream was really soft, either because the alcohol did not fully freeze up or because the freezer case was too warm.\n\nSo how do I rate a place that has seven strikes but one home run? As much as I loved the Secret Breakfast, based upon the other flavors, I really can't give this place more than 3 stars.", "author": "Paul L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-02-26", "description": "As a professional Hungry Girl, I am inherently suspicious of people who don't know enough to appreciate the elegant appeal of artisan ice cream.  \n\nI was fortunate enough to grow up in a home surrounded by fruit trees, vegetable gardens... filled with the smells of baking and cooking.  This is one of the reasons I chose to live in the Bay Area - for the Food Culture - and perhaps, as a subset, the Cult of Food.\n\nWe baked seasonal pies by the dozen, peeling, coring and slicing bushels of apples in the Fall, often having warm-from-the-oven pie with milk and sharp cheddar cheese for dinner.  Summer meant doing battle with the Japanese fruit beetles, racing to pick nectarines that grew heavy in our tree: jam, pies, and cobblers cooled on every kitchen surface.\n\nThe towering lemon tree meant sugar-slicked smiles and dueling lemonade stands operated by rival teams of siblings.   Just typing this memory conjures the grinding whiirrrrrr of the old ice cream maker, the perfume of sun-warmed strawberries, the crunch of rock salt and chipped ice.\n\nI have my upbringing to thank for my infatuation and great weakness for frozen dairy treats.  It is also to blame for my inability to appreciate most commercially available product because it simply isn't \"rich enough\".  It just depresses me to look at the packaging and see \"Low Fat\" or \"Reduced Fat\"  - to me, it may as well read: REDUCED PLEASURE.\n\nThese days, I'd much rather have a single dip of an ethereal ice cream (sorbet or gelato) from a lovingly edited collection; I turn my nose up at encyclopedic flavors and toppings.  I scream for ice cream boutiques!\n\nAfter an insufferably dismal \"meal\" at a pretentious vegan place, I practically skipped several blocks and burst through the door, rosy-cheeked and breathless with anticipation.  The shop is warm and cozy, the decor is simple and bright.  \n\nMy eyes searched for the Boccalone Lard Caramels, which I discovered at the Ferry Building several years ago.  It is my habit to purchase whatever quantity is in the glass jar, to smile winningly as I ask for ALL of them to be added to my order. The marriage of sugar, salt and fat is luxurious.  It's an olfactory jackpot.  \n\nThe first time I sampled this otherworldly confection, my knees trembled so violently, I had to sit down.  My eyes glazed over.  All my senses were mesmerized by the symphony of sweet and savory; the delicate wrapper glistened with body-temperature porcine unctuousness.  I dabbed it behind my ears.  \n\nBoccalone #Cinque - the ultimate in seductive scents.\n\nNo Lard Caramels in sight... But behold:  Bacon Brittle.  Yes, please!\n\nI oohed and aahed and Mmmm'd, tasting my way through half of the selections.  There were a few that I almost skipped because I had to remind myself that theirs is not an ordinary vanilla.  It's the most un-vanilla (wink) vanilla you've tasted.  Like, your eyes roll back in your head and an audible moan escapes from somewhere deep in your being kind of goooooooood.\n\nThe Black Sesame was technicolor vivid, tap dancing across my tastebuds: rich, toasted, nutty, creamy, sweet.  It was big, and I liked it.  I chose Brown Butter + haus made brittle to keep it company in my compostable cup.  Imagine my  delight when the sugar cone I'd struck from my order was placed atop one of the scoops.  So my ice cream was wearing a hat, too!\n\nThe Amigo let me taste his Sundae: chocolate & vanilla sprinkled with sea salt and anointed with a generous dollop of heavy cream, WHIPPED, FOR HER PLEASURE, densely dairy and hardly sweetened.  Oh, yeah, baby - you know just how I like it!\n\nI wanted to go slow, slow, slow and take my time.  I wanted to savor every spoonful of sweet, creamy, buttery, salty, nutty, cold deliciousness that danced on my tongue.  Alas, 9:00pm came too quickly, as did the bottom of my cup. \n\nIt was a Cinderella moment, to be certain.  One more wistful glance into the freezer case, just a few more hungry gazes over the empty counter top... The once-attentive staff turning quickly, efficiently into mice, scurrying to close up shop, cleaning and tidying.  The clock began to chime: one last look, as I turned and stepped out into the street -\n\nThere I stood, for a brief moment in the darkness.  The whirrrrrrrr a phantom whisper in my mind, the fragrance of sugar and cream clinging to my hair,  a sticky smile upon my cream-kissed lips.  \n\nLife is so very sweet.", "author": "Kim D."}

The ice cream has a lot of air pockets (reminiscent of cheaper, lower quality ice cream) and it melts pretty fast. The ice cream doesn't taste cheap or anything, but it doesn't have the wow factor. \n\nI still prefer other ice cream shops like Bi-Rite and Smitten in SF, and Ici and Fentons in Berkeley. \n\nIf you do go, Secret Breakfast is a must!

But I can overlook whatever airs the employees might have if the ice cream rocked. From my group, I got to try a number of flavors. \n\nSecret breakfast -- the only thing I enjoyed was the texture from the cornflakes. I love sipping bourbons,  but it came across harsh in this ice cream. And it was bracing against the bright and refreshing ice cream base.\n\nApple miso -- lack of consistency since getting a chunk of miso here and there ruined the experience\n\nFluffernutter -- tasty but became quite one note after the fifth spoonful\n\nMalted chocolate -- mild chocolate flavor, no maltiness at all, and again, monotonous after a few spoonfuls\n\nVietnamese coffee -- this was the only one that succeeded for me. It hit the nail on the head with the coffee flavor and just the right amount of sweetness\n\nGuinness gingerbread -- like the secret breakfast where one ingredient overtakes the while thing, the molasses is the only note that I got. . .

This is my friend's favorite ice cream joint out of the three, so being an ice cream fanatic, it was a given that I would be making a visit whenever I would be in the city next.\n\nIt's a small joint, just like most ice cream places. To be honest, the two-headed cow mounted on the wall scared me a little. Why is it there?! Anyways, I tried Secret Breakfast first, and I think I knew I was set on that scrumptious flavor, but Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee was tempting. Thank goodness my boyfriend got BB Viet Coffee while I got Secret Breakfast. Both flavors were amaaaaazing! The bourbon in Secret Breakfast was a little too strong for me when I took a bite that was overwhelmingly ice cream and lacking corn flake, but I devoured it in minutes nonetheless. BB Viet Coffee has a really strong cafe sua da flavor, so if you're not accustomed to in-your-face-Vietnamese coffee, then it might not be enjoyable. It costs four bucks a scoop, but they give some pretty generous scoops!\n\nIn conclusion, I love you, Humphry Slocombe!

Well, after feeling a little nauseous from some alcohol prior, I wanted to try their \"Secret Breakfast\" flavor (the one that's written about in the 7x7 big eat SF list).  Well, I took a little sample, and it made me feel even more sick.  The taste of the bourbon didn't sit well on my palate that evening, although it probably would taste better without alcohol in my system.\n\nInstead, I tried the Vietnamese coffee flavor, which was really good and tasted a lot like \"cafe sua da\", complete with finely grinded coffee grounds...which was delicious.  I got the kiddy scoop for $2.75, similar to how much one'd pay for Ici in Berkeley or BiRite.\n\nI'll probably come back here and try their Secret Breakfast...but on an 'emptier' stomach, if you get my drift.  Perhaps then the alcohol taste would be more palatable.  \n\nWe came here around 8 pm, and there was a small line forming outside.  Fortunately it moved pretty fast, and the workers were able to give us samples quickly and were very friendly.  \n\nAnother great thing about this place is that they take credit card.\n\nI'll be back, for sure, next time I'm en La Mission!

Finally made my way down there to a part of the Mission which has dramatically transformed over the last 20 years.  I like the vibe in this area of the Mission over the \"main corridors\" which can be a bit much sometimes if you don't have your hipster game face on.  So, pretty much immediately, I was in a more relaxed state of mind.\n\nEven though it was a chilly evening the night I went, ice cream almost always is a welcome treat regardless of the weather.  I ordered up their chocolate malt and 4 Barrel coffee flavors.  While their menu had many of the trendy \"now exotics\", I tend to stick with the classics and slight derivations.  Sure, maybe not the most adventurous here with new ice cream flavors, but my previous forays into other new and unusual flavors typically leave me disappointed despite the \"quality\" of the ice cream itself.\n\nSo, as we all have our particular taste bud proclivities, I must preface my personal ice cream criteria with a few fundamentals, and that includes density and creaminess.  I do not like airy, fluffy ice cream, chalky consistencies, or too sweet. \n\nOn those points and more, the 2 scoops I got nailed it.  Really, really liked it.  I didn't find any of the ice crystals others have complained about.\n\nI would be happy to return and recommend this ice cream joint to my friends and plan to return with my wife and 2 boys who will certainly swoon.\n\nThe final bonuses about Humphry Slocombe: no line around the block, welcome service, and no up-street snooty attitudes. :-)", "author": "Patrick M."}

C'mon folks, plenty of room at the top.\n\nI'm glad I finally made it.  And thanks to yelp, I was prepared.  I came knowing about the cash only payment and determined not to let the Secret Breakfast and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee be the \"good advice that I just didn't take\" (that would again be ironic, don't you think?).  Both flavors were really really good, very smooth, perfect texture and consistency.  The Secret Breakfast had a delightfully sweet bourbon taste with bits corn flakes and caramel.  Delish!  And I normally do not like coffee ice cream, but I'm glad I made an exception for the B. Bottle Vietnamese Coffee here.  So many flavors, I wish I was in a situation when I have 10,000 spoons when all I need is a knife.\n\nYeah, I've been trying to hit as many ice cream shops with the intent of making a ranked top ten list of ice cream places.

Her message reminded me to make a special trip to the Mission District, and I was glad to meet with fellow Yelper David N for a midday visit. Contrary to my previous experience, the venue was well lit and they finally carry their two signature flavors: Secret Breakfast and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee. Before going head first into these popular flavors, I first sampled Blanche's Cherry Cheesecake and thought the flavor was weighted towards the cheesecake with elements of cherry fading into the background. \n\nWithout wanting to deliberate any further, my double scoops of Secret Breakfast and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee ($3.75) were as good as advertised. Both scoops were not creamy like the ones at Mitchells or Bi-Rite, but instead were super thick with an greasy texture in every spoon. The Secret Breakfast carried a sweetened bourbon flavor embedded with plenty of frozen sugary corn flakes to taste like bits of crispy caramel brittle. The Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee was steeped in gourmet espresso flavor with a twist of Werther's Original for a full aromatic finish. Each flavor was vibrantly sweet with definitive depth and intensity to render major wow factor with every spoon. It was a sensational one-two sugary punch that knocked my sweet tooth silly by the time it was said and done.\n\nWithout all the kids and teenagers in the store, the atmosphere was much more calm and relaxed. Service was patient and down to earth friendly as we sat next to the window and enjoyed an uninterrupted session of heavenly treats. The culmination of service and two really fantastic flavors were factors that led to their new rating.

I would go on Muni for as long as it takes (because parking is horrid) to get be some o' dat Jesus Juice again. I swear when I tried it, my eyes went O_O and I thought I died and saw Jesus himself. My friends didn't seem to like it as much, but I love me some red wine, so that plus the Coca Cola after-taste blew my mind a little.\n\nAll in all, Humphry's unique flavors and cute set up definitely make it a must-have when I'm in the area.

The better the ice cream, the better the mood.  Humphry Slocombe is no exception; in fact, it might be the pinnacle example of this theory.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm reading about all these flavors that are very seasonal, such as the prosciutto and salted caramel.  From what I heard there, though, there are only three they make all year round: coffee (Blue Bottle Vietnamese, I believe), Secret Breakfast, and... uh... sorry, I forgot the third.  But, it doesn't matter, because I'm going to tell you about Secret Breakfast anyway.  (And another one that is seasonal... so... sue me).\n\nOkay, here's the scoop...  ha.  \n\nSecret Breakfast is bourbon ice cream with corn flakes inside.  I want to say they were frosted flakes, or maybe bound with honey, as they were nicely sweet as well.  This... was... amazing.  This might be my new favorite flavor of all time ice cream.  This was very nicely balanced, not overly sweet, a slight hint of salt from the flakes, and a great mouthfeel and body throughout.  Totally going back and totally getting this again.\n\nDespite my college days, I do not recall hearing of a concoction called Jesus Juice, which is apparently red wine and Coca-Cola (R).  You know what?  It makes a hell of a sorbet.  I would be hesitant to call this an ice cream given it's consistency and texture.  Maybe more of an Italian ice.  Whatever.  It was damn creative and damn tasty.  Not as astounding as Secret Breakfast maybe, but I'm a bourbon guy first, and a wine guy... fourth?\n\nIf you're in SF, go here.  Go.  Trust me.  Trust yourself.  Trust the scads of reviews on Yelp.  This is amazing stuff, and definitely worth the visit.  Look for (and try for free) several seasonal flavors, like Basil Lime, Here's Your Damn Strawberry, Hot Banana, and more.  Let those taste buds go avant garde and party!", "author": "Art T."}

Yeah, that is Humphry's.\n\nThe first time I got to try Humphry's ice cream was from Bitter+Sweet in Cupertino. Somehow Bitter+Sweet manages to bring their most popular flavors (e.g. secret breakfast and butter beer) straight from the source in San Francisco all the way down to Cupertino without affecting the taste and quality. The first time was really a tease and I am glad I got to try it again.\n\nOut of all the flavors that I've tried, my favorites are the secret breakfast, sweet summer corn, and butter beer. They have tons of flavors, but those are the most unique that I have enjoyed. The secret breakfast is a bourbon based ice cream with frosted flakes folded in. It may sound like a strange combination, but it's actually really good. The cereal adds a nice crunch to the creaminess of the ice cream. The bourbon flavor was a tad bit overwhelming in the last batch that I had, but it was still great. The sweet summer corn was exactly what it sounds like. It was nice and sweet and the corn flavor was apparent. What I found interesting though, was that the summer corn ice cream was very airy; unlike the other flavors.\n\nThe staff was very accommodating and samples were generous. I know some places get really annoyed when their customers ask for so many samples. I don't feel too bad asking for samples here though. This place is just that awesome!

Also tried the peanut butter curry which tasted more like PB with just a very slight hint of curry. Really interesting. I got the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee which was delicious but I can't say it tasted specifically like Vietnamese coffee, as much as just strong coffee.

This tiny ice cream shop does live up to its name and has some unusual flavors that rotate, but the staple is the Secret Breakfast which is vanilla ice cream mixed with bourbon and cornflake cookies. I was excited to see a pumpkin flavor ice cream, so I had that as well. All I can say is, \"Wow!\" The flavors do stand out. I can really taste the strong flavors and spices of the pumpkin. I tried other pumpkin flavors at other ice cream shops, but this one wins the battle of great flavor where I felt I was eating a real pumpkin. The Secret Breakfast was pretty flavorful.

It's very close to \"Bi-Rite\" but less line. The shop is very tiny. They got a seating inside and outside. Decor is pretty simple in white and sophisticated - very \"San Francisco\". Quick service. \n\nIt's cool that they got funky flavors. But I think they should put the ingredients somewhere so that people can see them since it's hard to imagine the ingredients of \"The Secret Breakfast\"... It would help for the customers to decide the final choice. I might have missed out the good flavors just because of the too funky names... \n\n\n- Gluttony Expedition -\nVietnamese coffee: Great. Not too strong but really good coffee flavor. \nOld thunder pussy:  I don't remember the taste ;( I'm sure it wasn't so memorable.. \nGolden beet saffron: Light yet good saffron flavor. It was more like a sorbet.\nHarvey milk& honey graham: My favorite. You see \"honey\" flavors quite sometimes but most of the time are not so good. This was very sophisticated one. \n\n\n- Conqueror's Deduction - \nThis was similar to \"Bi-Rite\" - in terms of quality. They were very sophisticated gourmet ice cream with full of the ingredients' flavors like \"Bi-Rite\". But the texture was a bit lighter and less creamier than \"Bi-Rite\". Very \"FINE\" quality. \n\nBut the flavors are much more adventurous and peculiar like the Secret Breakfast than anyone else. I think it's great that they are very unique and bold to go something weird or/and wild - out of the box. It's a very \"San Francisco\" to me - to be very unique and different from others. LA and OC got a less tendency for the spirit - they seem to be like everyone else - lacked in the originality. It shouldn't be like everyone else - especially ice cream competitions in SF seem fierce. Obviously they stand out from the crowds. This place requires you to be a little more adventurous than usual. I think all the tastes were alright. They were tasty but lacked in punch unlike \"Bi-Rite\". \"Bi-Rite\" is much less bolder flavor choices but got more WOW factors in flavors.  \n\nThey got less varieties than others. They claim they have like 10 to 12 varieties daily and rotate the flavors often. I have no problem with lesser options - I can avoid tasting so many and wondering my final decision. It requires you to come back for the different flavors. \n\nIt's nice that they got a less line than \"Bi-Rite\" but similar quality ice cream to \"Bi-Rite\". I still prefer \"Bi-Rite\" to \"Humphrey\", but I'll come here over \"Bi-Rite\" for adventurous flavors and less line. \n\n\n\"Humphrey\" and \"Bi-Rite\" are more gourmet ice than \"Mitchell's\".\nHere's the summary:\n\n- \"Humphrey\":  bold and adventurous flavor choices, less varieties than others, light yet fine taste and texture, less line than \"Bi-Rite\"\n\n- \"Bi-Rite\":  unique yet great flavors, lots of varieties, great texture, gourmet ice cream, ridiculous line for the hot days\n\n- \"Mitchell's\": richer and creamier than others, wide and unique flavor varieties (Asian, Mexican, American - all over), pop&mom ice cream with bold flavors, long line\n\nI still prefer \"Bi-Rite\" overall, but they are all different creatures....\nIt's hard for me to say which one is the number one.

I can't have too many bites of the ice cream. It was a good thing I had a scoop of the coffee and another scoop of the vanilla to balance the flavors out. I could even still taste the vanilla after I ate a lot of the coffee, which usually doesn't happen... meaning that the vanilla is strong! Their variety of flavors and unique selection is cool.

The \"butter\" however, pills up and leaves you with a grainy consistency that takes awhile to melt. \nThe result is a thick layer of cream that you have to scrape off of the roof of your mouth, and a heaviness that I don't necessarily associate with ice cream.

Secret Breakfast, I command you.\n\nMy fave combination as of late has been the Secret Breakfast and the Pink Apple Sorbet.  I've adopted this combination when I was in Nihon and while on the ferry, purchased a common summer dessert.  A cup of cherry flavored shaved ice, surrounding a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Mixing something creamy with a scoop of sorbet has become somewhat of a habit for me.  Secret Breakfast is a lovely sweet scoop of Bourbon tinged cream, bursting with crunchy clusters of cornflakes.  Although I am quite the wimp when it comes to alcohol, there is something wicked about feeling slightly flushed after my usual scoop.  The Pink Apple has a mild sweet appley taste, but not too overly strong.  If anything, it provides cushion from my first taste of the Bourbon hitting home.\n\nThe mixtures create an interesting menu, such as the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, Candied Ginger, Ancho Chocolate, and Pumpkin Five Spice.  In addition to the variety, I am very much into the modern take on 50's diner style.  The counter faces the windows and local passerby as one can swivel on the bright red diner stools.  Patient and helpful staff here as one continues with free samples and decisions to be made.\n\nA local dessert stop, especially after consuming my spicy burrito from El Farolito just a few short blocks ahead.", "author": "Miika M."}

AMAZEBALLS. EPIC. PHENOMENAL \n\nI'm not kidding you, as I took my first lick of Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast ice cream all these words popped into my head. It blew me away. \nTo be honest, Humphry Slocombe is not my overall favorite ice cream shop in the Bay area but as long as they offer their Secret Breakfast I will continue visiting them over and over again.  \n\nLocated in the Mission, Humphry Slocombe is a small, extremely popular ice cream parlor. What makes HS stand out is their creativity. Their creative flavors are bold and intense. You won't find normal vanilla, chocolate or strawberry here. On my most recent visit to SF I went to HS three times. I tried many of their flavors, all of which were really good. I think their ice creams are a bit denser than most I have tried but they're still pretty creamy. These are all the flavors I tried in my three visits;\n\nSecret Breakfast- Bourbon & Cornflakes \nPeanut Butter Curry\n5 Spice Pumpkin\nFluffernutter- PB & Marshmallow \nCinnamon Brittle\nBlack Sesame\nJesus Juice- Red wind & Cola\nBlue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee \nCoconut Ice Milk\nTahitian Vanilla\nBrown Sugar Fennel \n\nAgain, the Secret Breakfast was fantastic. You could taste the bourbon so much that I swore I was going to be drunk by the time I was finished with my scoop. It also had a somewhat caramel taste. I also loved the crispy corn flakes inside this ice cream too. My other favorites were the black sesame, PB curry and Jesus Juice, which also had a strong alcohol taste. HS also has some excellent toppings, like homemade mallow fluff, frosted peanuts, alcohol infused cherries, homemade butterscotch, etc. \n\nThe three times I visited the lines were actually really short, which was surprising. The prices here are slightly high but the quality and intense flavors of their ice cream make up for the prices. The staff here are all super friendly and willing to let you try as many free samples as you'd like. Oh, and they now accept credit cards as a form of payment.  \n\nIf you haven't already been to Humphry Slocombe you need to, especially if you're an ice cream freak like me", "author": "Craig R."}

Slawcumbe?\"\n\nTry as I might, I could never remember how to pronounce that last name . . so I successfully looked an idiot to everyone of my friends I had the fortune of talking with that day. But after deciphering my words, most of my SF friends would grin, nod, and say \"Niiiiice\". It's actually a little disturbing the consistency of that particular response but I guess it goes to show the popularity of this place.\n\nWhen all was tried and tasted, I felt like I was in limbo. It wasn't as much that the ice cream was really really good but more that there was just nothing really wrong with it. I tried the following three flavors:\n\n1) Tahitian Vanilla: Always gotta try the vanilla and it was decent. The texture was very smooth and creamy but there were some ice crystals. The flavor was pretty good but for some reason, it tasted a little more like cereal milk, kind of like the kind they serve at Momofuku Milk but it was a little more subtle. Thought that was a little weird but again, the ice cream was pretty solid.\n\n2) Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee: I gotta say I wasn't really a fan of the taste. The texture of this one was the best of the three I had but I guess I'm more of a classic coffee ice cream kind of guy. This tasted a little more exotic and the scent/taste held a little more in my nose than I wanted. \n\n3) Secret Breakfast: This was the one that my friend had recommended I try and you know what, I'm a fan. It took me probably until the last few bites but I was eventually turned. Again, the textures were pretty smooth and the bourbon plus the corn flakes is a very unique combo that surprisingly works. If you're gonna get one scoop, this one is probably the one to go with. Although, I guess if you're just visiting and eating this only once (like I was), spending the better part of your ice cream experience wondering whether you like or hate it is probably not time well spent...\n\nOverall, it's definitely a place to visit. It's very unassuming with a little seating area. The people who work there were very friendly and allowed us to try whatever we liked.

They do not have any basic flavors but they think outside the box and create unique flavors.  This place reminds me of Ici in Berkeley, small shop with unique flavors.\n\nI sampled the secret breakfast, blue bottle coffee, Harvey Milk and creamsicle.  In the secret breakfast you can really taste the bourbon in the ice cream and gives it a great taste.  The blue bottle coffee tastes delicious and has a great coffee taste without being too overpowering.  My girlfriend and I wasn't feeling either of those at the moment and ended up getting Harvey Milk and Creamsicle.  The Creamsicle tastes exactly like the ice cream bars and it brought me back to my childhood memories.  The Harveys Milk was my favorite out of the four that I sampled.  It was a honey ice cream with honey graham cracker.  It was a mild ice cream flavor and the honey graham cracker topped it off.\n\nI believe this place is better than bi-rite and would recommend the Harveys Milk.", "author": "Steven L."}

It may have been ice cream fatigue--highly doubtful, because I can never have too much ice cream--but I think I was more impressed by the variety and unique flavors than I was with how everything actually tasted. \n\nI think it's worth a try though... you might find that hidden gem of an ice cream in here, and there's something for [almost] everyone!", "author": "Lily C."}

Whereas Bi-Rite takes the familiar and elevates it to new heights (salted caramel, balsamic strawberry), Humphrey Slocombe turns flavor combinations on its head with a unique base flavor (cantaloupe) with the occasional secondary twist  (cayenne pepper).  Based on their website, they seem to rotate their long list of flavors fairly regularly while retaining a few of their staples.  No first visit would be acceptable without getting their trademark Secret Breakfast.  \n\nTaking my first bite, the bourbon flavor immediately cuts through the cold sweet vanilla cream and the crunch from the cornflake nuggets along with additional notes of sweetness took me back towards my childhood self eating a bowl of frosted flakes as well as transforming me towards future gray-haired self sipping Jim Beam on the rocks on a leather chair.  How often can food be simultaneously nostalgic and anticipatory (is there an antonym for nostalgic?).   \n\nRandom sidenote:  As I was outside allowing Secret Breakfast to bend my own personal time-space continuum, I watched a cute little girl with her dad come out of the shop and her scoop fell out of the cone and onto the sidewalk.  We all stared at that lonely scoop melting away on the sidewalk and I think tears were welling up in her eyes .  I would have had to deduct a minimum of two stars had they been heartless not to give a complementary scoop but they not only did so, they also allowed her to keep her original cone so she had her ice cream along with two sugary cones!", "author": "Christopher S."}

The taste of alcohol was strong, so if you're into that, by all means this is a winner. The cereal is a good complement to the strong bourbon taste,  but just a personal opinion that it was a little too much on the overwhelming side for me.\n\nOh yeah, for some strange reason, my tongue went numb for about 30 minutes post-ice cream.

Try their flagship secret breakfast and yelp your opinion.\n\nExtended Review:\n\nRecently, I've decided to go on this crazy ice cream adventure to try each place in SF worth trying. So, I gathered up some cousins and took a trip to Humphy Slocombe. I'm always scared to try a place which such good reviews. It's one thing to stumble across a place and think nothing of it versus making a trip solely for the ice cream and being disappointed. Please don't disappoint me!\n\nFirst sign of good things: I found parking across the street right away. The area has more places to try than parking spots available. The fact that it was not even an issue on this trip was awesome. \n\nSecond sign: Short line, started inside the building right by the ice creams. Later on other people were not so lucky.\n\nThird sign: 2 VERY HELPFUL Humphry Slocombologists behind the counter. I've read some reviews that said they were welcomed by unfriendly staff, but this was not the case!\n\nEnough with the signs! Talk about the secret breakfast and anything else you got. \n\nAlthough I've heard about the Secret Breakfast, I didn't know what goes into it. I was surprised by the bourbon, didn't see that coming!  didn't mind it at all. It tasted like breakfast from the corn flakes and then the bourbon hits right after. It gave the ice cream character and made it more than just a sweet flavor. Everyone will have their own opinion but thumbs up from this guy!\n\nThey find fun little names for their flavors. It gives the ice cream some pizazz to match the creativity and ingredients that goes into creating it.\n\nOther flavors: The salted dulche de leche was good, near the end it tasted a bit too sweet, but it was good. I had a bite of some Jesus Juice and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and they both tasted great as well. Someone else in our group also got the apple coded bacon and liked it. I wish I could give my opnion but it was finished so fast I didn't get a chance to ask for a bite! I guess thats telling enough?\n\nSize: like most ice cream places don't expect a buffet line/costco scoop. That being said I found myself more than satisfied with two scoops.\n\nThere are a few seats inside and out. My abacus app wasn't working but it looked like 10-15, something around there. \n\nIt is somewhat easy to get lost. It's right on the corner but there is no sign on the window or wall. There is a VERY SMALL fold up sign that they put on the corner. It's probably 2 feet tall and only seen by pedestrians. If you are driving you just need to know 24th and Harrison. It will be right there on the corner.\n\nNext time I will go A) out of my way to get some, B) only when I'm already in the area, C) never Ill go somewhere else? ANSWER: Definitely would go out of my way to make a trip to come here.  Thank you for not disappointing!", "author": "Glenn M."}

And while I can't claim to have met any witches here like I have at Mitchell's, I HAVE run into several CEOs for local startups here before!\n\nCarrying about 12-16 flavors at any one time, they rotate through a much larger list, though some flavors stay on between rotations. One of these permanent flavors, and my personal favorite, is their secret breakfast: bourbon and cornflakes. Sounds weird? Yeah, it did to me too, but it's full of awesome. If you don't mind the (light) flavor of bourbon, give it a try. Really. Your taste buds will thank you. \n\nAnother equally amazing, but less seen flavor, is their milk and graham crackers - try it if they have it. Of course, with all their experimental flavors, there are definitely some misses (or just flavors for very specific palates), like salt and pepper. That's just weird, yo (but yes, I still tried it, because it was so weird - it tastes exactly like you'd imagine).\n\nTexture differs a bit between flavors, depending on the makeup of the ice cream, but, for the most part, their ice cream falls a bit more on the creamy and slightly airy side. This is the only thing that prevents them from being a full five stars for me, as I prefer mine a bit denser than what I can find here. \n\nIf you don't mind sharing with your friends, I recommend getting something with more scoops to share - definitely a lot more cost effective ($5 for three scoops versus $2.75 for one)! These guys also use Square, so credit cards are a-okay (for those who aren't familiar with the product, it basically makes credit card processing much more affordable for small mom and pop type shops like these guys). For those with a preference for more traditional flavors of the rich and dense variety, you may be better served at Bi-rite: just as tasty, but I find myself here more often simply for their intriguing flavor varieties.", "author": "Johnny W."}

I'm the one who whines incessantly when the skinny white girl in front of me at Bi-Rite Creamery dares to have samplings of six flavors of ice cream much to the consternation of those waiting behind her. I'm the one who murmurs \"anorexic bitch\" while she licks her little spoonettes and drops them one by one in the \"dirty\" tin. I'm the one who hands her a medic alert bracelet so she can let others know that she has a problem. \n\nThat problem would be self-absorption bordering on psychotic hubris. Yet, here I am at Humphry Slocombe on what I assume to be an atypically slow evening, and instead of asking about the state of their quaint business or the genesis of their obscure name, I keep asking for one sample after another of their strangely alluring flavors - salted licorice, McEvoy olive oil, balsamic caramel, Valrhona fudgsicle, secret breakfast. My God, I am a skinny white bitch. Someone stop me. Jamie W. had to have me sedated by pointing to the $6 bag of bacon peanut brittle....yes, bacon peanut brittle (see my photo). You know what happened next. \n\nI couldn't taste the bacon. I think I saw the bits in there, but the peanuts and molasses are too overpowering for a little pork fat to get through it all. But I still ate the whole bag. Oh yes. I don't let porcine-related disappointments stop me from ruining my teeth. But you know I also had to try the ice cream being the creamery connoisseur that I am. I went for a single cup - a scoop of strawberry candied jalapeno and a scoop of Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee (see my photo). Although audacious, the jalapeno kick did nothing to enhance the strawberry, but the Blue Bottle was everything I wanted it to be and more. \n\nThe moral of this story is to go with your gut and go risk-averse on the flavors. The quality of the ice cream is really high and not overly creamy - more Breyer's than Haagen-Dazs if you're thinking in Safeway terms. But the flavor clashing is hit-and-miss on my palate. The other lesson I learned is not to judge skinny white girls too harshly. Oh who am I kidding?

They indicate a place has got it going on, they create excitement, they often can't be helped. \n\nBut in Humphry Slocombe's case, they so easily could be helped that I suspect part of the staff's job is to preserve the line at any cost. \n\nThe other day, after finally getting inside and up to the ice cream case, one server was chatting with a pair of ladies, insisting they try *every* flavor, while the other just stood there, arms by his sides, with a catatonic stare. Eventually nudged into service by a managerial figure, he started scooping uninterestedly and monosylabically. Nonsyllabically, really. OK, bro, maybe you're in shock, you've looked out the window just in time to see your partner engage in amorous relations with a border collie. It happens. But the overall no-bueno-ness of servicio may have lessened my enjoyment of their Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee ice cream: I found it grainy and watery, with a flavor that was distinctly average. And average on the Baskin-Robbins scale, not the Bi-Rite scale.\n\nWhile we're on the subject--the flavor choices? I know it's the Mission, pushing the envelope is what we do, but beer ice cream? Basil? Salt and pepper? Je sais que ce n'est que mon avis, mais c'est ce que nous appelons en anglais \"twee.\"", "author": "Douglas G."}

The mission location is slightly sketchy & a bit of a walk from Bart but the people who work there are extraordinarily friendly. Even on busy days they make small talk & never rush you when you wanna sample new flavors. Whenever I get the chance I always grab a cone & two pints to-go. One, secret breakfast, two, usually vietnamese coffee. There's enough reviews + praise for their secret breakfast flavor but there's a reason people rave about it. It's freaking delicious. A little bit bourbon, a little bit cornflakes make this boozy, creamy ice cream with fun tasty texture. My current ice cream obsession is their black sesame flavor. Toasty, nutty, rich creaminess. If you've ever tried those Asian black sesame soy milk drinks it tastes just like that but better. There's not a whole lot of seating but it's the mission, immerse yourself.

The day I came here, I tried Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and Oolong tea. I ended up going with the coffee flavor, as I LOVE vietnamese coffee. The ice cream really captured the strength and subtle sweetness of vietnamese coffee. It did end up overpowering me in the end because it is such a strong flavor.\n\nOne thing I did notice here though: there's a pretty high fat content in this ice cream. There were a few chunks of milk-fat here and there, and by the end of the cup, all our mouths were coated in that fatty, slippery feeling. We just drank some water after our ice cream and all was good.\n\nOn a busier day, expect not to find seating nearby. There were a few small tables inside, and two tables outside.

It used to be that 2 scoops cost the same as a single, but now it's another dollar up ($3.75). \n\nAnd secondly, I don't feel there's enough coverage of their newer beverage, the Bourbon and Coke ($5), which features two scoops of Secret Breakfast with their own homemade bourbon caramel drowned in Coca-Cola. \n\nMost of the reviews, though few they are, remark on this magical elixir have been rather negative. I, however, found it delightful. For me, usually, Coke and ice cream never mix. Eating ANYTHING sweet and then drinking Coke usually creates this flavor that can only be described as \"Bleh!\" But, the Bourbon and Coke float pulls it off. I don't know why, but each flavor works in harmony with the other to create this refreshing treat, and I recommend it. They give you the rest in a miniature, glass bottle.", "author": "Christine A."}

But, I do go out of my way to get the flavors I love here, so I'm giving Humphry's 5 stars.\n\nThey sample freely without dirty looks or grunts, so if it's your first time, sample a few before making a decision.  Otherwise, there is only a 33.3% chance of getting something SUPER and up to 33.3% of getting something NASTY!\n\nHere is a mostly complete list of flavors I've tried over my many visits:\n\nThe good:\nVietnamese Coffee/Blue Bottle--coffee ice cream like you've never had it. My # 1\nCinnamon Brittle-love this!  delicious little brittle pieces. My #2\nSweet Summer Corn--weird in a good way, surprisingly yummy! \nOolong Tea--mild tea flavor and so yums. My # 3.\nBlack Sesame--nutty, semi-sweet and tastes asian. Love it. (almost made my top 3)\n\nEverything else:\nSalt & Pepper--It wasn't bad....it was F-ing disgusting.  First you think you taste vanilla, but then it gets really salty and just as you confirm the salt, you get a pepper rush up your nose.  No thank you.   \n\nSecret Breakfast--I love the cornflake bits, but the whiskey infusion is overpowering\n\nChocolate Smoked Sea Salt--unpleasant., left a salty coat on my tongue\n\nElvis the Fat Years (Banana, Bacon, Peanut Brittle)--I love bananas and I love bacon, but not together!!\n\nHoney Thyme--too mild of a flavor/calorie waster.\n\nMcEvoy Olive Oil--not a fan, this one also coats the tongue in what feels like a layer of lipid.  \n\nChili Lime Sorbet--Tart and Spicy. Meh.\n\nAfter School Special (Chocolate-covered Ridge potato chips swirled with caramel in Tahitian Vanilla)--Interesting! It was ok, but not sure If I would have it again. \n\nMalted Milk Chocolate--didn't taste any more special than regular ol' chocolate icecream to me", "author": "Susan L."}

The ice cream is delicious.  Perfect textures and an array of flavors to choose from, it's hands down my favorite ice cream.\n\nYou must, you must, you must try the secret breakfast ice cream.  Cornflakes and bourbon? Who would have thought of putting those two together?  Doesn't matter, it's magical.\n\nWhite chocolate lavender.  I know that floral tastes are somewhat acquired and might not fit everyone's palette, so I'll let you be the judge.  However, I found it to be a perfect balance of flavors.\n\nMcEvoy Olive Oil.  Savory and salty with hints of olive oil.  That first taste is a little funky, but you just want to keep eating. Very delicious.\n\nThere's always a dilemma of whether I should go to Bi-Rite or H&S, but I always find myself craving the secret breakfast and wander my way over to get a triple scoop here.", "author": "Miyeon L."}

When it's good when does it not deserve five stars?\n\nTwo flavors I really like from here: secret breakfast (big surprise) and Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee.  Secret breakfast really does taste like bourbon.  It's not a very strong bourbon flavor, it's subtle, but noticeable.  The cornflake bits mixed within are crunchy, sweet and compliment the flavor of the ice cream well.  I actually wish more cornflake bits were mixed in.  The Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee is a very good coffee flavored ice cream.  I'm not a coffee drinker but have always enjoyed coffee flavored ice cream and this one's a winner.  Also have sampled the Jesus Juice (red wine and coca cola) which has very noticeable wine flavoring and tasted pretty good, as well as the peanut butter curry flavored ice cream which wasn't too bad surprisingly.", "author": "Erich D."}

They actually have to taste good. \n\nI love ice cream, like really love ice cream, like more than is healthy for an adult. And when I say I love ice cream, I love all kinds of ice cream - from McDonald's McFlurries to Treatbot and Smitten. I love vanilla. I love olive oil. I love ube. I like \"normal\" flavors and I like unique flavors. Here's what I do not love - Humphry Slocombe. \n\nAfter hearing all about Humphry Slocombe and the unique flavors, I was so excited to try it. On the day I visited, I was bummed to see that none of the flavors that sounded interesting to me were on the menu, but I figured there had to be something I'd like. I sampled the Salted Watermelon and the Prosciutto. Salted Watermelon was tolerable, but Prosciutto was absolutely gross. I ended up going with Secret Breakfast and Cinnamon Brittle since I'd read they are popular, but after eating about half, I did something unthinkable - I threw my ice cream away. Both flavors were a little too strong and the texture wasn't all that creamy. To top it off, the ice cream left a weird filmy feeling in my mouth. Not worth the calories...", "author": "Nicole L."}

In comparison to Mitchell's, Bi-Rite and Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous, Humphry's fell a bit short.\n\nI will give them credit for friendly service and luckily, having no line on our Sunday afternoon visit. Unfortunately, when I asked for a scoop of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee ice cream on a cone, the lady behind the counter replied, \"Well, it's kind of crumbly today so I can't form it onto the cone. Would it be okay if I scoop it into a bowl and add the cone on top?\" I figured she was being apologetic and I didn't want to budge flavors (I've ONLY had a teensy obsession with Vietnamese Coffee recently) so I said it was fine.\n\nShe wasn't kidding when she said the ice cream was CRUMBLY! It had this grainy texture that I totally wasn't digging. It was such a shame considering the flavor was great and the consistency of both my boyfriend's Fluffernutter and sample of Secret Breakfast were fine. In fact, both flavors were damn good.\n\nI'm sure Humphry's had an off day, and the sweet worker even warned me when scooping my ice cream. However, if you KNOW that you're serving ice cream that isn't up to par, please don't serve it at all! It's a rip-off to customers that are expecting the best!

The line on a Saturday was surprisingly. I got to try Jesus Juice (cold red wine - interesting but not my cup of tea), Wexler's root beer (tasted like cinnamon), and Red Hot Banana (tasted like spicy cinnamon). We decided on the 3 scoop with Secret Breakfast, Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, and Nutterfluffer. The Secret Breakfast had a creamy, clean flavor to it and you could taste the bourbon here and there. I was disappointed that there wasn't a lot of corn flakes in it though. The Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee flavor definitely tasted like Vietnamese coffee. A must for coffee lovers. This flavor, along with the Nutterfluffer, tied for my favorite. The Nutterfluffer tasted like Nutter Butters, but sweet and fluffy in an ice cream! Both were so good I bought a pint of each!\n\nThe scoops are reasonably priced for the interesting and high quality type of ice-cream. I also like how they accept credit cards with their nifty iPad and electronic device. You can have your receipt emailed to you but I trust them.

But it was still something the wife and I wanted to try, so we went on down, like good little sheeple.\n\nWe knew we had to try the Secret Breakfast, because that's what every single review raved about.  But we found out it contains alcohol in it, so we had to pass.  That left us trying to figure out what to get, which was actually a really hard decision.  Not because everything looked awesome, but because all of the flavors just seemed way too out there. Like way far out there, man.\n\nSo we ended up getting as close to traditional flavors as we could.  The strawberry ice cream was really good, especially with the strawberry chunks.  And the vanilla was decent as well, with a really good vanilla bean flavor.\n\nBut overall, the experience was just okay, not awesome.

Yep. There is a definitely a whole world beyond the pedestrian chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry ice cream. I think it is bold, yet somehow thoughtful that Humphry Slocombe incorporates savory ingredients into their ice cream which can only be found at high-end restaurants and introduces it to mass population. \n\nThe shop is located at the corner in somewhat less crowded side of the vibrant and cultural Mission District. Therefore, parking is not a hassle. It was not crowded when we arrived. Customer service was friendly and informative. The young chap behind the counter was willing to give us any flavors to sample. My friends yearned to come here for olive oil and oolong tea ice cream. Unfortunately, both flavors were not available on the day of our visit. The staff told us that not all flavors were made every day, so if you plan to come here, call ahead and ask them for the daily flavors.\n\nWe got to sample a few wacky flavors like beet sorbet, salt and pepper, and prosciutto.

I'm hoping for Meyer Lemon gelato and or Strawberry Black Olive ice cream. I call....long message, but no answer. Check Facebook where you are supposed to be able to see the day's flavors. Nope, not updated since Friday. Bummer. Gonna have to gamble....\n\nGrrr, parking nightmare, but I prevail. Spot secured. I go get in line. There is no way you can get anywhere near the case to see what kind of flavors there are-you have to be far enough toward the front of the line to be able to look I think. There is ONE dude working. He is.......slooooooooooow. Customers are also sloooooooow. They have not made up their minds at all. Really? You had a loooong time while you were waiting in line to consider. But no, you are going to sample every single flavor. I think that must be part of the whole 'experience.' You waited in line forever, so now you are going to take forever too. Payback. I kind of get that, but I'm still irritated because I am not there for the 'experience.' I just want some damn fine ice cream to take home.\n\n Customer in front of me mentions that there is a freezer case now with pre-packed pints. Cool, I say, maybe they have what I want already. I go look. Freezer empty except for one lonely pint of peanut butter something. Sigh.\n\nGo to get back in line. There are now like eight more people in line. I try to take my old place....but no, hipsters are not down with this. Wow....I took maybe 5 steps to the case, looked for about...maybe 4 seconds as there was only one thing to see, and then 5 steps back. Yet, they tell me I've lost my place?  I am frankly not capable of entering into a discussion with these d-bags without morphing into the insano screamy lady.  So I leave.\n\nCollege girl SO disappointed when I get home. She says if we go back, she can deal. She has no problem pushing around hipsters, or dealing with slow ice cream boy. She tells me she has honed her 'deal with d-bag skills' at the ucla campus bookstores. She is clearly a dedicated foodie, and willing to put the knowledge she has acquired at college to use for the greater good ( namely our dessert plans.  See? Hasn't even graduated yet, and already she's giving back to society. I'm so proud)\n\nI say ok....We go back. I wait in car. 5 minutes later she is back. \n\nHer:  'Wow, that ice cream dude was stoned outta his mind.'\nMe:  ' Oh, I guess I missed that. I thought he was just slow.'\nHer: ' Yeah, you're outta touch....and I thought you were a child of the 60s'\nMe ( changing the subject):   'Uhm, where's the goods?'\nHer: ' Oh, I pushed everyone out of the way, looked in the case, and didn't see any of the flavors you wanted. I asked stoned boy and he said no, they don't have those favors today'\n\nSo we went to bi-rite grocery, and bought the creamery's pre-packed orange cardamom and the salted caramel. Yum and NO LINE. \n\nYes, Humphry's your ice cream is 5 star good. But your counter help, lack of flavor updates, and customers ( which I know you can't help, but still detracts big time)....not so good.  3 stars over all because of the not so goods.\n\nNext time I'll go to DeLessio's and buy Humphry's ice cream there.

Thank you to Lolia S. (yes, the fro-yo girl does ice cream too!) for bringing this shop to my attention.\n\nThe place isn't very busy yet.  There was a nice steady flow of customers as I sat on one of the comfortable stools enjoying my ice cream and cookie on a lazy Friday afternoon.  With the exception of what I ordered I only tried the Thai Chile Lime Sorbet which had a nice flare of heat rise up through my nostrils.  It was very good, but I'm not a big fan of coconut infused anything.\n\nMy small cup consisted of the Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee on the bottom and the Secret Breakfast on top (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/47OC_X6KkiDDQ4jwoCUjFg?select=I4Y8LZRCN9B0gCQFPYYdCQ).  I enjoyed both with a homemade chocolate chip cookie.  The Vietnamese Coffee has a very subtle coffee flavor which I love.  Since this was the flavor on the bottom and I was eating pretty slowly, by the time I got to it it had softened into a very smooth, creamy ice cream.  The Secret Breakfast is great.  I love how the saltiness of the corn flakes, the bitterness of the bourbon and the sweet cream interact.

Ice cream places like this give me life. I love finding unique flavors and Humphry's has it ten fold! I came in on a Friday afternoon and it wasn't too packed. When you walk in, there is a chalkboard with all the available flavors on it. I tasted a few: Tahitian Vanilla, Secret Breakfast, White Miso Peach, and Toast and Jam... Needless to say that toast and jam flavor was the winner! It tasted like my childhood breakfasts and exactly like grape jelly which got the little girl inside of me so freakin' excited. I took a scoop of that on a cone and was on my way. I was insanely excited to try my Uncle's ice cream as well and he got the blue bottle vietnamese coffee flavor. That was so good too!

The bourbon flavor is strong but the flavor stops just shy of that all-too-familiar alcohol burn and shudder when a drink is just a little too strong, and the cornflakes provided great texture and cereal-milk creaminess.

It's my favorite ice cream flavor and am always up to try variations. The combo of 'coffee' and 'sugar' was off. It was super sweet. Again, not impressed, but it was hot outside and wanted to cool down from the within side. I wasn't up for trying any of their other flavors so I settled for coffee.

Well, turns out it doesn't stand up at all. Sort of fell over onto its face.\n\nI had to wait in a decently long line.  It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, so that's fine and to be expected. What's not fine and to be expected are employees who want to rush you through that line (ok, I get that you can't stand there and sample every flavor, but with weirdly intriguing names like \"secret breakfast\" and \"jesus juice,\" you kind of want to try before purchasing) and treat you like you're inconveniencing them by being there. \n\nService is one thing, but taste/flavor/etc is another. If a meal or sweet is really great, it doesn't entirely bug me if the service sucked. I tried a few flavors and settled on secret breakfast, which is a blend of bourbon and corn flakes. It was pretty icy/thin; not creamy at all. And there were literally two pieces of corn flakes in the entire thing. Bourbon just started tasting like sweet vanilla after a few bites.\n\nI realize after writing this that I sound pretty nitpicky and crazy.

I had wanted to try Bi-Rite but heck, we were in the area so Humphry's it was!\n\nThere were so many flavors I wanted to try but I didn't want to bother the ladies working there with, \"Can I try this? And that? Ooh and that, too. No nevermind that!\" so I stuck with 2-3 tastings. I settled on ... ugh, I don't even remember anymore. I took a picture of it, though, so I hope someone can figure it out! I am really punching myself in the face for forgetting the name because it was heavenly! I can still feel the sweetness of it on my tongue...\n\nThe best part of my visit here is that when we got to the register, my girlfriend YJ was about to pay because she wanted to treat me for treating her to dinner (yeah, I don't get it either -- it was her birthday!), the cashier heard me mentioning her birthday and decided to just give the ice cream to us! (She got the cone, I got two scoops in a cup.) Yay, free ice cream!\n\nNow I don't know if they always do this or if the cashier gal was in a friendly mood but don't go stampeding to Humphry's just because it's your birthday now. ;)\n\nFor a Friday night, it wasn't all too busy and I really enjoyed the flavors they have. I wish they'd open up a shoppe here in Los Angeles; I'd sacrifice gaining five pounds to have their ice cream everyday! ;D (Yeah, it's that good.)\n\n(Love the weird decor, too.

I can see you making a face right now...stop it.\n\nI ended up going with the Blue Bottle Coffee and salted watermelon. The watermelon was crisp, refreshing though I couldn't taste the \"salted\" part. Blue Bottle Coffee was amazingly rich and creamy with tiny specks of coffee ground sprinkled throughout. \n\nMy husband opted for Secret Breakfast. An old-timer who resembled Willie Nelson told us it's the only flavor he ever gets there, so my husband had to try it.

Interesting flavors.  Really friendly service.  They will let you taste just about everything and the flavors are subtle but true to the natural flavor of the ingredients.

Big chunks of peanut brittle, smooth banana flavor throughout and nice bacon surprise every now and again. \n\nAlso had the olive oil.  It was rich and creamy going in with the olive oil flavor finish.  Very subtle and quite nice.  \n\nSo why not 5 stars.  The ice cream is quite sweet.  The first scoop is a 5 star experience.

Decided on a scoop of Balsamic Caramel, Honey Thyme and Secret Breakfast. We all agreed the Balsamic wasn't for us, the taste is hard to describe, but the after taste was better. Honey Thyme was sweet and refreshing. The Secret Breakfast was really good- a nice, bourbon kinda good, I wish it had more corn flakes in it though. It's a good concept for good ice cream. Nice and creamy, freshly made. \n\nWe were able to find seats inside. The seating area consists of about 8 bar stools and a counter in front of the window and a couple tables and chairs outside. \n\nA good place to visit when you're craving ice cream and want to try something different and creative. Be sure to sample before you buy, or you'll be left with a wasted scoop of Balsamic Caramel... I mean, a wasted scoop of ice cream.", "author": "S Y."}

The whole purpose of this place seems to be \"look at how many unusual flavors of ice cream we can make\" and not about \"look at how well we can make ice cream\".\n\nMy major complaint is about the texture of the ice cream itself.  It is a bit icy and chalky, contributing to a very unsatisfying mouth feel.  This is compounded by the compostable utensil given to you if you get a bowl as opposed to a cone; the spoon also has a grainy texture and something less than a neutral flavor.  Please, can the sanctimony and just give your customers a plastic spoon.\n\nThere are indeed a wide variety of flavors on hand and the three I've tried were OK but nothing special.  The chocolate with sea salt was a bit unbalanced to the point that the saltiness overtook rather than enhanced the flavor of the chocolate; the cinnamon brittle had all its flavor in the bits of brittle with the ice cream itself contributing next to nothing other than its icy texture; and the black sesame tasted like they poured bottle of toasted sesame oil into the ice cream base.\n\nI can only imagine that this place is popular only because its clientele are unsophisticated ice cream eaters and are simply taken in by the novelty of things like olive oil and black sesame ice cream.   As a curiosity, it works, but as a serious culinary destination it is not noteworthy.  I would suggest the proprietors try to improve the basic texture of the ice cream and reassess the balance of flavors in some of their concoctions.", "author": "David O."}

I would recommend getting an ice cream here any day. However, me and my girlfriend decided to get the bourbon caramel coke float and share it together. It was DELICIOUS.

The sweetness was subtle, the creamy texture and flavor were stars, but the oolong... the tea flavor really sang at the latter half of the taste profile. Major major winner of the day.\n\nAnd next time... we will ask for NO salt on our Tin Roof sundae. The candied peanuts and rich decadent fudge were really marred by the excessive salt sprinkling. Blech. I scraped off as much as I could after my first bite, and then the sundae was much tastier for us. Salt on ice cream is just not my thing, I guess.

Then, I made over to the ice cream bar....\n\nThe flavors I tried were:\nChocolate lavender: which was sweet and very rich in lavender, especially the aftertaste. \n\nJesus Juice: which was crazy because it was bursting with flavor.

I follow Humphry Slocombe on Twitter and get to read first hand the kind of antics this place gets into. The workers are wild bunch, and they truly love their jobs- and their Ice Cream! The business associates themselves with alot of other great SF businesses including Blue Bottle Coffee Co. and Boccalone- very cool. \n\nThe Ice Cream itself is heaven sent- seriously. I hate to bring them up in this review(since this is a Humphry review), but I thought I had the best 5 Star Ice Cream flavors ever when I tried Bi-Rite just a few blocks away. I promise you my fellow Yelpers, Humphry Slocombe is just as good- if not better! I really can't even compare them- Humphry S stands alone, needing other ice cream joints compared to IT!\n\nLike previously mentioned, the Secret Breakfast flavor is my favorite. A mix of RUM and CORN FLAKES- lol! Absolutely awesome! Another favorite is the Vietnamese Coffee- I'm telling you this flavor is amazing!  If you haven't tried Humphry yet then you must give it a shot...\n\nHumphry offers about 10-12 flavors a day and accepts cash only. If you go, you should also try their cookies- They're freshly baked, super soft, and very yummy!

When we finally got into the place, I was pretty surprised to see the most unique flavor combinations I've ever seen - Salt and Pepper Ice Cream and a Sorbet called Jesus Juice (Red Wine and Coca-Cola).  \n\nI sampled the Vietnamese Coffee and the Chocolate Sea Salt.  I thought the Chocolate Sea Salt was a bit on the saltier side but the Vietnamese Coffee was pretty spot on and amazing.  I got a scoop of that as well as a scoop of the Secret Breakfast.  It turned out to be a pretty good combination.  \n\nExtra tip - the Frosted Almonds taste exactly like Frosted Flakes...get it on your ice cream with of course Marshmallow Fluff!  Mmmmmm....", "author": "Joel C."}

Can you really go wrong with a quirky little ice cream joint in the Mission? Two things that I love about Humphry Slocombe: one, it's close to work and two, it's devilishly delicious. \nThere is something about the Jesus Juice that scared me but also tempted me to compromise my way out of my normal food segregation laws. I also super loved the bacon brittle that we bought at the counter. I love coming here with coworkers to celebrate... well any old thing! Three scoops of Humphry Slocombe just isn't enough.

Generally, you'll find fan favorites like Jesus Juice or Secret Breakfast. In many of my other trips here, I've generally found the likes of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, Sesame, and/or Tahitian Vanilla at the store.\n\nThough there is a varying offering of ice creams, none really compare to the tastes of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee! As a (blue bottle) coffee lover and an ice cream lover, it's hard to come by an ice cream that really does justice to both, and I believe that this shop has hit the jackpot with the perfect blend of creaminess and coffee flavor!", "author": "Mary C."}

No dice.  \n\nHere is my really sad face and crying, tear filled eyes because it wasn't available.  :-(  ::::\n\nOk, now that that's over with...\nWe did try several other flavors.\nMost notable were the smoked chocolate sea salt - holy smoke Batman! It's not for the faint of heart.  But it is excellent - and worth a try.  And our other favorite was one that you'll see in a lot of reviews - the Secret Breakfast.  The combination of bourbon and corn flakes was spectacularly rich - I highly recommend, especially when paired with the smoked chocolate sea salt.\n\nWe also tried Guinness Gingerbread.  While it was good, it didn't knock my socks off after the second spoonful, and I wish I had gotten something else.\n\nI really wanted to get a t-shirt (it's an addiction I have - which I have to be careful of, because you can really look like a cult weirdo if you happen to walk into a restaurant because of a craving while wearing their swag...the other side to it is you might be mistaken for waitstaff..) and they literally had none in stock besides the mannequin.  However, I was directed towards the website to complete that purchase.\n\nOne more note:  I hail from Milwaukee WI.  This is the land of frozen custard.  Which I have been told by a friend from LA is tantamount to eating frozen butter.  (I want you to know that he thought that was amazing, and not gross).  What they have here at Humphry Slocombe is ICE CREAM.  It is NOT frozen custard.  It will not be as rich as custard.\n(Just a little warning for you - in case you are like me, and all ice cream tastes a little \"thin\").  This isn't the fault of the maker...it's just because it's not frozen custard.\n\nOne last tip:  Follow them on Twitter.

It's not hot but you can definitely taste a hint of the Thai chili pepper.\n\nThere are about 8 flavors there...some sweet and savory. The workers there are friendly.

Came here at night and the line was out the door which was a good sign. The line moved pretty fast so it wasn't too bad. The first thing that caught my eye was the unique names. Immediately the Jesus Juice made me start guessing the flavor but I was completely off lol. I sampled the Jesus Juice which was red wine mixed with some sorbet which was pretty good. The secret breakfast was a perfect combination of bourbon and cornflakes, two very odd combinations that worked well for this ice cream. Lastly, the blue bottle Vietnamese coffee ice cream. It was a good balance between sweetness and coffee. Price wise, its average for your craft ice cream palors at $4 a scoop, but worth it to get the double scoop for $6. All in all definitely a place I will revisit to try all the new flavors!", "author": "Ricky C."}

Autumn Harvest was pretty good - a sweet corn ice cream that had a refreshing taste to it, my problem with it was that there wasn't more \"corn\" flavor...it seemed a bit faint.  The Tahitian Vanilla was okay too - the texture was decent, but it wasn't as creamy as I like my ice cream to be...also, again, the flavor was pretty faint and not really sweet enough.  \n\nWith organic ice cream, I feel the flavors should really come through since unneeded chemicals are not being added...at this spot the flavors were barely there.  Also, the execution of the final flavor seemed to not be very good - if caramel mixed with anything tastes like vinegar, that's not a good thing.

However, as a self-proclaimed ice cream blob of 20+ years ( really believe 5% of my weight is attributed to ice cream), I can assert that there's nothing special about Humphry's Slocombe Ice Cream except for the weird spelling of its name (where's the damn E in Humphrey??) and slightly interesting flavors that they offer.\n\nJust like places in LA, there's always a lot of hype over these \"designer\" ice cream places that charge much more than necessary; in this case, Humphry's charges $3 for a scoop (ripoff) or for a better \"deal\" $5.50 for 3 scoops (which is what I shared because I rather get ripped off on 3 cheaper scoops than 1 really expensive scoop....it's a logic that is hard to follow, but it's kept this rating at 3 vs 2 stars lol).  At least they take credit cards...MUHAHA take 3% off your 3000% profit margin biatch!!! They even promote a Humphry book in their store which \"reveals\" the secret to rip-off ice cream recipes!! I'll bet even the book is just paper with ink all over its insides :P\n\nSo once again, my rudimentary ice cream palate was not impressed by this Slocombe ice cream business as it didn't tickle my taste buds nor arouse any inner desire to eat an entire tub (which would have cost like $200 probably). I even tried 3 different flavors in hopes of tripling the chance I would get \"THE\" flavor that I would rave about in my Yelp review.  The Vietnamese Coffee, Oolong Tea, and Special Breakfast flavors unfortunately were as-advertised: basic, cool-sounding, yet overpriced ice cream.\n\nIn fact, some of my Oolong tea has ice granules in several bites!! I did not pay for 99.8% ice cream and .2% ice crystals (which are indicative of either old or remelted ice cream). This alone should have eradicated any chance of a high review, but I guess since I finished my 3 scoops (with the help of a friend), it was edible.  I kinda hoped the Special Breakfast (which contained bourbon) would get me slightly intoxicated to the point where I would LOVE Humphry's.  Sadly, even an attempt at legal substance abuse failed.\n\nOverall, I would deter someone from going to Humphry's unless you really really wanted to be a cool Norcal hipster eating over-priced ice cream in your skinny, tight-ass jeans. Other than these people (and really rich, non-value-seeking people), just drop by your local Rite Aid and get 2 tubs of Mint n Chip & Cookies n Cream (for the same price as 3 scoops) which will give you satisfaction for days/weeks/months to come!\n\nBtw, like all SF places (Socal over Norcal!!), there's no parking and you have to pray you're not hiking 10 uphill-blocks to pay for this basic ice cream.\n\nRITE AID ICE CREAM, FTW ALL DAY, EVERYDAY!!! :)", "author": "Rob C."}

I love that they veer away from the conventional ice cream flavors and try something different. Trying different flavors while you're there becomes a fun game and the entire experience of being in an ice cream shop is elevated to another level with all these different tastings!\n\nThis place is known especially for it's secret breakfast flavor. Essentially it is bourbon with cornflakes...sounds weird, and in my humble opinion, it kind of was. So I steered away from it and went to the next intriguing sounding one - Thai Chilli Lime Sorbet. I'm a sucker for a spicy kick and this packs a punch! What a novel taste for ice cream! I combined it with the Pink Apple Sorbet and the taste created was absolutely phenomenal. There are so many other types of flavors that I want to try...and for less than $4 for two scoops (which is plenty) it is so very doable!\n\nThe staff is also great and very helpful. They are very environment friendly which I love - so when you try flavors, they give you steel spoons rather than plastic spoons. And let's face it, who doesn't love a place where the mascot is a two headed cow? This place is the shiz as far as ice cream places go. My favorite in SF so far as it has the perfect mix of ambiance, staff, and naturally, absolutely amazing interesting, ever-changing flavors!", "author": "Aditi R."}

I liked that you could order a single (which I thought was pretty large for a single) and still try two flavors.  I had the Secret Breakfast (bourbon & cornflakes) and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee.  They were a perfect combo and the ice cream itself was so luscious!  I'm definitely a Secret Breakfast fan now and would have to have that again, but try one of the other flavors (maybe if they had the Cream Cheese or Ancho Chocolate one).

It's a shame that they often run out of their flavors by the end of the day... I came here after dinner one night, not particularly late - maybe 8pm - and they were already out of almost half of their flavors for the day.  And there was still a long line... couldn't they have made more ice cream for the customers who kept on coming?  They were open for at least another hour after that.  It just discourages me from coming back if I don't know if they'll even have a complete menu of flavors available.\n\nThey were out of Secret Breakfast so I didn't get to try it - I did try the Jesus Juice and that was... weird.  I give them props for being creative, but some of the flavor combinations just didn't do it for me.  I tried the Vietnamese coffee as well, but I didn't enjoy it (funny, because I do like Viet coffee... I just didn't think the ice cream did the real thing justice, as I had been expecting).  I ended up getting a scoop of the Tahitian vanilla and the black sesame, which I thought was a nice flavor combination.  The texture of the ice cream was fine, but not particularly outstanding.  I've had similar flavors at Ici before, but they were better than Humphry Slocombe's versions.\n\nOverall, I'd come back if I were in the neighborhood or if I knew I'd be able to try the beer flavor (which I am still curious about).

Really buttery.\nLimoncello - a nice, refreshing sorbet. Very lemony and I love the tanginess of it. If you like sour/sweet stuff, give it a try!\nJesus Juice - the name itself is interesting right? It's got red wine and something else in it I can't remember. It was.. interesting. \n\nI really want to try their Oolong flavor. Tea+ice cream has always been my favorite.\nI've always gotten really big scoops from them; I can barely finish the whole thing with the cone if I got 2 scoops. \n\nIf you're going on a Saturday -- We went on a Saturday evening at about 7:30, just about the right time to get in line, get a seat, and avoid the huge crowds of people coming for after dinner desert. When we left, the line reached the end of the block. \n\nThe reason why the line is so long/moves slowly is because most people try a sample of every flavor they have. And they let you too. There's always two mugs full of spoons on top of their counter. Take advantage of their generosity and try everything (if you wish) before you decide on a flavor (or 2!) It's a smart business strategy for them and we benefit from it too ;)\n\nIf you're here, order the crazy flavors!! Don't let yourself leave this place with a boring flavor and later complain about how not exciting it was. Be adventurous!!! ;)", "author": "Erica L."}

After hearing so much about this place, I knew I had to give it a try. I enjoyed the unique selection of flavors and decided to have the secret breakfast (whiskey and cornflakes), Jesus Juice (coke and some type of red wine (I think it was port)), and Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee. I agree with every other reviewer in that secret breakfast is their best flavor. I don't normally like alcohol flavoring in food, but this was really well executed. You can taste the wine in Jesus Juice for the first few bites, but then it just becomes coke flavored (which I really have no issue with). The coffee flavor was true to its name and just tastes like coffee. I enjoy places with a unique selection of in store made flavors, and Humphry certainly offers that. The only thing I would have changed is that the ice cream here is a bit more icy than I prefer. I am the type of person who normally doesn't shortcut on sugar and fat when it comes to dessert, so I like rich creamy textured ice cream. Purely a personal preference. Maybe to some of you this is a pro rather than a con. Overall good ice cream, but I will probably still be getting my full fat ice cream fix at Bi-Rite.", "author": "Tiffany N."}

Really interesting flavors, and finely crafted ice cream.  The texture is like that of gelato--so not quite as rich as bi-rite or Rick's in palo alto.  But still fresh cream, and they did not skimp on the ingredients.  \nice-cream review:\n(Daddy's) Secret Breakfast was my favorite there.  You can taste the bourbon--possibly Bulleitt--even the alcohol in the ice cream. and the corn flakes add a great texture.  \n\nTahitian Vanilla was chock full of vanilla beans and again, that gelato-like texture.  Quite possibly the best vanilla I've had in SF.\n\nBalsamic Caramel was very interesting.  Actually a little sour from the balsamic vinegar, making the flavor a little intense and sharp.  The caramel then rounded out the end of this flavor journey.  I didn't get a full scoop of this, cuz I wasn't in the mood for the sharp intensity.\n\nOolong tea.  The tea they chose was honestly not a very good oolong, but it was still clearly an oolong.  I wish they just went to Ten Ren and picked up some cheap oolong there, which would be leagues better than the stuff they used.  their oolong was a little smokey, bitter and not very well balanced.  But the flavor of the ice cream was still enough to make me get a scoop of it.  and it was especially good with the secret breakfast, mixed into it.  the nutty/grassy/smokiness of the oolong complemented the bourbon well.\n\nAnyway, I now have a new go-to ice cream joint in SF.", "author": "Fong L."}

Since the flavors are so exotic, there are some hits and misses.  \n\nI really like the Secret Breakfast ice cream.  This is ice cream that contains corn flakes and has been infused with Bourbon.  It has an unique flavor.  I can definitely taste the Bourbon, \n\nThe Vietnamese blue bottle coffee flavor is good.  I can definitely taste the coffee and the coffee beans that were used to make the ice cream flavor.  Moreover, I felt a caffeine jolt from eating the ice cream.. It is probably one of the best coffee ice cream I had.  It is not too sweet or creamy, \n\nI especially like the peanut butter curry.  The curry flavor complemented the peanut butter flavor very well,  It made the ice cream slightly spicy and creamy.  A nice unique ice cream flavor.  \n\nThe Olive oil ice cream flavor was interesting,  It is hard to describe. It was creamy and slightly sweet. It sort of tastes like creme fraiche, but less tangier.\n\nThe Balsamic Caramel was interesting.  It had a very strong flavor,  I could taste the vinegar in it.  However, eating caramel ice cream that had a strong vinegar flavor felt odd.\n\nAlso, the Boccalone Prosciutto was interesting.  I never had ice cream with pork in it.  I could definitely taste the smoked pork in it.  It was OK.\n\nI am looking forward to coming back and trying out some more flavors.  They only serve about 12 flavors of ice cream and they rotate the other flavors every week. \n\nIt is not a good as Bi-rite, but you cannot really compare them.  It is like comparing apples to oranges. However, Bi-rite has a more modern and expensive ice cream freezer unit.  It is frost free and prevents ice chips from getting into the ice cream.  Because, ice cream should be creamy and smooth, not crunchy like a 7-11 Slurrpee.", "author": "Hiroshi K."}

It's a popular ice cream joint, so expect a bit of a line and if you're late in getting there, some of the flavors may be out (happened to one of the guys in our group).\n\nOverall... if you're a fan of thicker ice cream, this is your place.", "author": "Justin L."}

It unpretentious and old school i.e no hipsters, entitlement  or gentrification here thank you very much. If you talk to a local (yes they do exist in this city) they will tell you of their child hood memories of going to Mitchell's on a hot summery night (again those also exist) or as a reward for a job well done. I love those kind of down home places that have strong memories in the community because they do something great and simple. \n\nHumphry Slocombe is NOT that and I don't think that's what they want to be. They like serving to the hipsters, they want to be that place where people go \"ohhhh have you tried secret breakfast\" as they play the \"have you been to/eaten yet?\" one-upping game. And that's okay. As a customer you just have to know what you're getting into and what  to expect. For example I don't expect anyone in the Bi-Rite line to be from the Bay Area or even know the history of Dolores Park as they smoke and drink there every weekend. And sometimes my tolerance level for that is high and sometimes it isn't and when it isn't on I move. \n\nKnowing what to expect and also coming on a slow night and raining (Wednesday) my buddy didn't have to wait in a line and got to try as much as 3-4 samples before we settled. I got the McEvoy Olive Oil and The After School Special. While sampling the Secret Breakfast, and the Flamin' Rum Raisin we sat outside and talked to some drunk dudes from out of town who were a hot mess and people watched some interestingly scary people walk down the dark street. We enjoyed our ice cream. It was delicious and complex, the service was a bit dry but I imagine explaining 12 flavors all day to wannabe- critiques like myself can be annoying. \n\nOverall very good but Mitchell's still holds a place in my heart for nostalgia purposes alone.", "author": "Jade W."}

I definitely have to be back for that!  They also baked cookies and brownies! Cookies, brownies, ice cream, ALCOHOL.. Best things in the world!!!\n\nRemember to bring cash! Knowing me, I always never have cash and just bring my hello kitty plastic.. Walked in, used the restroom, lined up, saw the cash only sign.. FUCKKKK... looked for a BofA. VINCENT got us lost and walk the total opposite way!!

However, about halfway through the scoop, I started to get really, really overwhelmed with the taste of salt. Whereas Bi-Rite's Salted Caramel is more of a \"back-of-the-tongue\" saltiness that hits you after the initial sweet caramel taste and fades away, HS's Chocolate Smoked Sea Salt was a full-on frontal assault of saltiness that listed throughout each spoonful.

Even though I have had a fair share of artisan ice cream in the past, Humphry Slocombe definitely comes up very high in my list. One, because they churn an interesting selection of ice cream flavor combinations; such as Secret Breakfast (bourbon and cornflakes), Thai curry peanut and white chocolate lavender, all of which I have uploaded pictures for. Secondly,  because I appreciate the fact that they take time to craft their ice cream, even if it means fewer flavors available each day, as compared to other creameries. Which overall, speaks for the quality of their sweet treats. I really appreciated the fact that the ingredients for each ice cream contributed both flavor and texture to the final product. For example, Secret Breakfast was more smooth and fluffy, due to the addition of alcohol; and thai peanut curry was much thicker and creamier due to the possible coconut milk or peanut butter in their custard base. What was equally fascinating is how each ingredient's flavors stood out. I must say that if I am willing to go all out into mission, while bearing 40F cold weather, just for their icream...it MUST be that good. So have a go for yourself and explore the wonders of Humphry Slocombe! It will not disappoint.", "author": "Jenny Z."}

I've had a lot of ice cream in SF this past week, and I was really excited to try Humphry because I heard about their wonky flavors. Unfortunately, I came on a day where it wasn't that crazy. The ice cream is creamy and just fine... but it didn't rock my world. I had gotten a small of Fluffernutter and Vietnamese Coffee, and I can barely taste the difference between the two. The coffee wasn't as strong or impressionable as I would have liked it to be. The fluffernutter was essentially all peanut butter, which did stand out but the marshmallow was missing.\n\nI sampled the Jesus Juice and I thought it was refreshing - red wine & coke.

I came here at night around 9, right before a rush of people started to line up. Thank goodness, because it takes so long to get through the line. I think that's because of all the taste-testing, and maybe caus they seemed to be understaffed for their demand (the same person scooped ice cream for my friend and I, and then walked to the register to take our money).\n\nThere's maybe about 6 seats inside, but there were a couple small tables outside, so we were able to sit and eat our ice cream! I got the Secret Breakfast (Per 7x7), and the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Bottle. For a little under $5, I'd say it's on the pricier side to what I'm used to paying for ice cream, BUT. Both flavors were very well made and did not feel too heavy. The Secret Breakfast was a little weird at first, with the bourbon and cereal combo, but I kind of dig the weird whisky kick you get in every bite. My friend got the Lime & Thai Chili along with the Secret Breakfast, and while I'd have to say that that was also well made, with a initial lime flavor until the chili peppers came in, it was a little too strange for me.", "author": "Melody L."}

I love San Francisco! And I love how yummy treats bring people together.\n\nDespite Humphrey Slocombe's promising name, flavors, and location...I give the local ice cream joint just one thumb up for their taste. And another one thumb up for their back stock. It was only a little past 2pm and they were already out of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee flavor and Fudgesicle Chocolate. Sad day.\n\nI chose the Honey Thyme because it was oozing with real honey flavor and had just the perfect hint of thyme in the background. After a while though, it just started tasting like vanilla because my taste buds could no longer differentiate between honey flavored cream and vanilla flavor (my boyfriend ordered the Tahitian Vanilla). I will admit though that their Grapefruit Sorbet was ridiculously good and realistic in flavor! It tasted like I just popped a grapefruit slice in my mouth when I tasted it. \n\nI advise all people to ask for samples because the creative names are a tad bit deceiving! Jesus Juice, for example, I found utterly disgusting. But that's because it was way too strong in alcohol flavor for my liking. \n\nHumphrey Slocombe is a local jewel that is sure to please any foodies palate, considering the fact that they have a multitude of flavors to choose from (everyday is different so it's an adventure).

I've come here twice within an 18-hour time frame.\n\nI can't get enough of their Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee and Secret Breakfast ice cream flavors.  The Vietnamese coffee flavor is exactly what you imagine a Vietnamese coffee in ice cream form should be.  Strong coffee flavor, sweet condensed milk, and very smooth and creamy finish.  The Secret Breakfast consists of bourbon vanilla ice cream with huge chunks of corn flakes--it's what some people would consider a breakfast of champions.\n\nI was able to sample other flavors like Guinness Gingerbread (another favorite, especially with the chunks of gingergbread you'll find in each bite), Red Hot Banana (interesting combo, but not my cup of tea), Balsamic Caramel (a little too savory), and Valrohna Fudgesicle (extremely rich--perfect for the chocolate lover).  Because I came back within such a short period of time, the flavors were pretty much the same from the night before.  \n\nThey've only been open for about 3 weeks and the lines are getting long.  Everyone working here is really nice and happy to see the crowds.  On a Friday night, two of the guys were just chillaxin and sipping on beers while helping out customers.\n\nA single (two scoops of 1-2 flavors of your choice) is $3.25 and a double is $4.50 (you can choose 4-5 different flavors).

Now wait with me in line for an hour in the freezing cold for Bi-Rite!\"\n\nAnd time passed. Dozens of scoops of Bi-Rite later, I finally decide to try it out. I mean, everything deserves a chance, right?\n\nJumpin' Ya-hoes-are-fat!! Is this what I've been missing out on all the years of my life? I can strongly state that Humphry Slocombe's is my new favorite ice cream. Better than Bi-Rite? Yeah it is. But of course, the thing with ice cream is that flavors are completely subjective and vary based on your tastebuds -- if you love the salted caramel from Bi-Rite, then I'm not sure if you'll find that at Humphry. Also, you might love some flavors and abhor others -- that's what tasting spoons are for.\n\nFor me, though, Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast is phenomenal. It has a hint of bourbon with little pieces of \"corn flakes\" (but they really taste like sugary crack clusters). The Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee is also an awesome flavor if you love condensed milk. I mixed the two and the result was mind-blowing.\n\nAfter trying this place, it's hard to understand why people wait so long for Bi-Rite. Unless, they are all skeptical like I was and have yet to try the awesomeness that is Humphry Slocombe. That isn't to say that I won't ever go back to Bi-Rite here and there -- I mean, a man's gotta have his Ricanellas once in a while.", "author": "Roy C."}

The coffee is reaaaally good - if you love Blue Bottle and if you love ice cream, then this flavor is for you. \n\nAlso sampled the McEvoy Olive Oil, Balsamic Caramel, and some ale flavor that's not listed on their website.

As far as flavor went, I couldn't taste much of a piggy note at all in the prosciutto ice cream, which I'm sure some would argue is a good thing. However, if I'm brave enough to order such a thing, I would at least like some hint of meat in my treat. Instead, it tasted a lot like bland ice cream base.\n\nThe Candy Cap in question is a mushroom. It adds a nutty quality to the dessert, and this was by far the best flavor of the three. Secret Breakfast, which I tried just a sample spoon of, is intended to be Irish Whiskey and corn flakes. I couldn't really taste any of the cereal, so basically it was a half-teaspoon of whiskey ice cream. That's not a bad thing, per se, but isn't exactly revolutionary.\n\nMy biggest problem with all three ice creams was the texture. Try this experiment: go buy yourself a good premium pint of B&J and leave it on your counter for an hour. Refreeze it, then taste the outer surface. Every one of the Humphry Slocombe ice creams that we ate had this same kind of grainy consistency. It's likely that the flavors that I wasn't getting were being washed away by the huge ice crystals ensconced in the ice cream. At any rate, it's not a pleasant texture for ice cream, and seems like the sort of thing that a pro can easily avoid. Looking at their flavor list, I think we kind of lost out on some of the potentially exciting ones. Unless of course, all those flavors end up just as bland as those we tried.

Perfectly sweetened ice cream with hints bourbon that were stronger than I thought.. Amazing.

It softens in your mouth and not in your cone or spoon.  It is also not icy.  Rather it is creamy.  These are the hallmarks of great ice cream texture.\n\nThe flavors are all well thought out and they are perfectly balanced.  A great example is the Secret Breakfast.  The flavor of the corn flakes is enhanced by the corn whiskey.  The sweetness of the whiskey enhances the sweetness of the corn flakes and the starchiness of the corn flakes helps with the texture of the ice cream.  (Adding alcohol to the ice cream tends to make ice cream icy.  But, starch counteracts this effect)  Also, the starchy flavors cuts the fire of the alcohol.  Genius.\n\nI have tried many flavors.  All of them are rich and buttery.  I love that it is not too sweet and that you can taste the milk fat in every flavor.  My favorites are the Secret Breakfast (Best Flavor Ever!), the Vietnamese Coffee and the Butter Beer.\n\nHumphrey Slocombe, can I marry you?

Why the hell did it take so long do you ask? Because once you get to the front of the line they ask you what flavors you want to sample. This practice is ridiculous. If someone wants a sample they will ask for it. It should have taken no more than ten minutes. \n\nNow all this would be forgiven had the Ice Cream lived up to the hype. I would wait over an hour for Bi-Rite's Honey Lavender Ice Cream, but not the off the wall crap they serve here. Prosciutto Ice Cream, come on. Who wants to eat a whole scoop of that? \n\nI tried four flavors: Secret Breakfast, Fluffernutter, Malted Milk Chocolate, and Brown Butta. None were even of the quality of your local Baskin Robbins. Secret Breakfast was disgusting, tasting strongly of booze. Malted Milk Chocolate tasted like an old milkshake from McDonald's. Fluffernutter subtlety tasted like Nutterbutters. Brown Butta had an indistinguishable butter taste. Some of the other flavors I did not try were pretty disgusting sounding. There was Salt & Pepper, Jesus Juice (which was wine flavored), and Honey Thyme just to name a few. \n\nHumphry Slocombe needs to quit being so eccentric and focus on making more traditional Ice Cream more tasty.

I thought it was just the secret breakfast because that was on top and I couldn't get to the Vietnamese coffee till after but no, it continued to have that effect, just not as bad. \n\nI also tried my boyfriend's scoop of STRAWBERRY MARGARITA, first bite was good, but it was super sweet.\n\nI don't see the hype about this creamery, I have attempted to come here about 3 times before I was successful and it's so hard to find.

Thought that if I had some sorbet with this so-called religious figure's name attached to it, perhaps something might happen. And yes, something happened. I enjoyed it.

You can tell they used a good quality olive oil since it has that fruity taste, but there was way too much orange zest. And I mean, the amount of orange zest definitely overpowered the flavor of the olive oil, which is kind of the point of this one.\n\nThe secret breakfast was good as promised by all you yelpers, but I wasn't wowed.

It is very odd to have curry and ice cream paired together, it's like a savory ice cream with a very strong nutty curry taste.  Like cold curry.  \n\nI also tried their Chocolate Sea Salt.  The sea salt really intensifies the flavor of the dark chocolate, it was like eating a very cold 80+% cacao chocolate bar. \n\nTheir Secret Breakfast flavor (bourbon and cornflakes) is a solid flavor, it's sweet and tastes like a very good regular ice cream.   \n\nI ended up sharing their Beer Week special with a friend (it's gigantic, 4 different flavor scoops for $5, what a deal!).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-05-08", "description": "After an unfortunate miss on Dynamo Donuts but a lucky find on La Panaderia I next made my way to Humphry Slocombe in the Mission - significantly praised by ChowHounds and Yelpers alike I felt it my duty to experience Slocombe and compare it to some of the offerings in Columbus Ohio, a place many call \"the ice cream capital of the world.\" Walking up to the small shop there were notably three young ladies standing outside enjoying small cones - and a small dog enjoying one as well. I asked what the dog liked and the one girl said \"the olive oil - its good for his coat.\" -- yes, she said that, I couldn't make something so insipid up.\n\nWalking into the small shop I was struck by the relatively drab appearance - no flourishes, just a bar, a white board, and 12 types of ice cream - excellent. A smiling staff of two offered me a taste (on cool metal spoons no less) and I gladly endulged - first on Balsamic caramel (best. Ice cream. Ever.), then Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee (not as good as Jeni's Black Coffee, but good) , then Andante chevre-strawberry jam (Good, but Jeni's fig and goat cheese is better,) and finally McEvoy olive oil (Better than Batali's - I could feel my coat getting stronger immediately.)\n\nHaving heard rumor of the Secret Breakfast from any number of sources I took a taste and immediately ordered a scoop in addition to a scoop of the balsamic caramel - no cone, just a cup - awesome. Sitting down at the long bar I dug in and slowly enjoyed the wonderful caramel peaks with the heavy nuance of a quality balsamic underneath. While Jeni's back home makes a superb Salty Caramel, this simply raises the bar a couple notches. In addition to the flavor, what struck me most was the incredible creaminess of the ice cream - almost a velvety texture on the tongue that didn't even seem 'cold' because it was so smooth. \n\nMy second flavor, the Secret Breakfast, was not only cleverly named - but incredibly well flavored. Consisting of candied cornflakes with bourbon-flavored ice cream it reminded me of the standard \"butter pecan\" except without pecans and with a substantial \"kick.\" While others have not mentioned it, I distinctly caught the flavor, texture, and appearance of raisin in the scoop which makes me wonder if this was indeed a candied raisin-bran as opposed to corn flakes. Once again, the ice cream was like velvet and absolutely superb.\n\nWhile I wish some of the more exotic flavors (Foie Gras, Government Cheese, etc) had been available and that they'd taken Credit Cards (see, again, the retarded $fine$ for not having cash on the way to Napa) I must say what I tasted was excellent and in the realm of designer ice cream I'd rank them on-par or better than our famous Jeni's at home - I'd come back for Balsamic Caramel in a heartbeat and next time aim to get the Blue Bottle and mix it with Valrhona fudgesicle.

On product alone, they are doing it right. Very smooth textured ice cream with bold flavor that is truly delicious. \n\nI personally admire the ambition of any recipe/flavor combo that marries unexpected ingredients. If the flavor joining succeeds, it makes the risk all that much more sweet. For me, this is encapsulated in Humphry's olive oil ice cream flavor. I don't know if I trust myself in saying this, but this flavor may be the best ice cream (based on personal taste preferences and flavor ambition) that I have ever tasted.\n\nThe Chocolate Goldrush flavor was also very very good. It's dark chocolate ice cream, may I add. The smooth texture was also there with surprising bits of crunchy waffle cone running through it here and there. \n\nIf there is anything not perfect about Humphry's, it's not the ice cream, because it is damn near perfect - it's waiting in line for the ice cream, which has averaged about 15-20 minutes in my experience. However, you can't get too mad because those that are scooping behind the counter let customers try a couple flavors if they'd like, which is what makes the line move so slowly.

I didn't have time to try all the current flavors but on the menu that night was the Shhh!! 'Secret Breakfast', Coconut Sherbet, Balsamic Caramel, Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee, and a few others to boot.\n\nAfter tasting the Secret Breakfast I see why the 'buzz' is swarming for this flavor. Excellent mix of 'secret' ingredients worth trying out. Crunchy, silky smooth flavor and sweet at the end.\n\nI ended up having the Balsamic Caramel with a great chocolate chip cookie that was very satisfying. The flavor to me was very sharp at first but the caramel really brings it back around to smoothen and sweeten it out. As for the great crispy yet chewy cookie, I was done! All smiles for me!\n\nI didn't get to meet the prodigy behind the sweet madness, but I definitely will be back for my occasional creamy indulgence.", "author": "Dave S."}

I think Bi-Rite is more reliable and may have a better base texture to its ice cream, but the mad scientist flavors at Humphry Slocombe kind of rocked my world.\n\nThe shop is cute and tiny, and rather hard to spot from more than a few yards away.  The interior is clean with all the flavors clearly on display.  When I went, there was a short line, for which I was thankful - it gave me some time to ponder my options.\n\nJustin C. and I sampled a number of flavors and shared two cups with two flavors in each.  I'll dispense with the rejects first.  The samples are definitely necessary at this place - how else would I have tried the strange, savory Thai chili lime sorbet?  I couldn't eat more than a few bites of this flavor, but it was refreshing and certainly weird.  I also passed on the Jesus Juice, which was a vibrant combination of red wine and cola.  I liked the flavor but found the texture a bit too icy.  The last sample we didn't end up getting was McEvoy's olive oil.  We tried this after we ordered and had a moment of regret.  It tasted like high quality olive oil, light and fragrant with a taste that was almost flowery.  Next time.\n\nWe were more than happy with the flavors we ended up getting.  Never in my life have I had bourbon and cornflakes for breakfast, but maybe I should start.  The Secret Breakfast was one of the best scoops of ice cream I have ever had.  The ice cream really tasted like bourbon, but the strength of the alcohol was moderated by the sweetness of the cream and cornflakes.  The texture was lush and creamy - if I could take my alcohol in this form all the time, I would be a fat drunk.  Young's double chocolate stout was another great alcohol-based flavor.  It was heartier and a little sweeter, and the flavor really developed in my mouth.  Next to the Secret Breakfast, though, my favorite flavor was the brown butter.  This ice cream captured the nutty, savory sweetness you get from that aromatic smoky pan sauce.  Good grief is it good.  The only flavor of our four that I could't die for was the Vietnamese Blue Bottle coffee, which I expected to blow me away based on reviews.  Maybe we got a bad batch, because ours was a little icy.  I did like the taste, though, which was grittily coffee, with grounds and all.\n\nThe day after our visit to Humphry Slocombe, Justin and I found ourselves in Blue Bottle Coffee.  There, we could not resist an affogato made with Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast.  I had that amazing ice cream two days in a row and have not licked it since.

I'm a fan of the mini tasting spoons, and applaud them for trying to be as green as possible.  Flavors change regularly, so don't get too attached to just one. \n\nI sampled Jesus Juice sorbet [red wine and cola] - I mean, c'mon, with a name like that you just HAVE to try it.  It tasted exactly like a mixture of red wine and cola, like sin in frozen form.  It was good, but I don't know that I would've been able to handle a scoopful of it.  Hubby tried the Salt & Pepper, and not surprisingly, found it to bee too salty.  Ah well.  \n\nWinning!  Rum raisin;  Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee - words cannot describe.  So far the best coffee ice cream I've tasted to date. I could slurp it up in a heartbeat; and finally, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance: Secret Breakfast - bourbon and cornflakes.  Um, yeah.  It was crazy good.  And yes, you can definitely taste that bourbon.  Whoo! \n\nAll in all, a yummy ol' time, and I look forward to trying their latest creations.", "author": "Shereen R."}

The texture of ice cream quite good (smooth, melts in your mouth) but I had about 4 bites and dismissed the rest.

It's like butterscotch candy meets ice cold beer.  You have to try it!  The second flavor I chose was \"secret breakfast\" (Bourbon and cornflakes) and it was also amazing!  Other flavors that day included malted milk chocolate, Guinness gingerbread, and balsamic caramel.  My friend got \"Jesus Juice\" which was red wine and soda.

In particular, I was excited to try strawberry candied jalapeno, or McEvoy olive oil (no foie gras for me; the only dessert made of foie gras that I've ever had - one from Momofuku Ko - has set the bar way too high for any other foie gras-themed dessert to even come close).  \n\nSadly, neither flavors were available then.  \n\nI was toying with the idea of trying the black sesame, but unfortunately it looked nothing like Passionflower's (http://www.passionflower.com.au)  black sesame ice-cream that I grew up on, and I have the biggest color prejudice when it comes to food and would not touch any food whose color is not agreeable (from my perspective).  \n\nSo I had to settle with the old favorite, Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee... with just the right amount of sweetness which doesn't overpower the coffee flavor, I'm starting to convince myself that I prefer this over everyone's favorite Secret Breakfast.  \n\nBut one thing that I just wanna put out there, WHY WOULD THEY HAVE A WALL ART FEATURING CAMPBELL'S \"FETAL KITTEN\" SOUP CAN? \n\nDiscuss.", "author": "Ange L."}

Pretty strong coffee flavor.\nSmoke Stack  - not a bad beer ice cream.  it was sweet and a little chocolaty. probably the best beer ice cream that we had.  \nBlood Orange Sorbet - this wasn't bad but wasn't great.  wasn't too flavorful and was a little too icy for me.  \nSecret Breakfast - this was pretty interesting, bourbon and corn flakes.  pretty sweet and you can definitely taste the bourbon. \nPomegranate Ale - another beer ice cream that was less beery and had a slight tart/sweet taste of pomegranate\nWinter Ale - this tasted a lot like winter, almost a pumpkin pie sort of flavor.  seemed like there was a lot of cinnamon or something in it.  \n\nOverall, Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream was some good ice cream paired with good service.  The beer ice cream was really interesting to try but I'm not sure if I'd order them over a regular flavor, especially the Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee.", "author": "steve w."}

Recommend ordering 2-scoops or 3-scoops because the marginal cost for additional scoop is about $1.  Obviously the profit margin is high since a scoop must cost less than $1 to make a profit.  So if you get one scoop, they earn a gross profit $2+ or 66%+.  Probably in the 80% range.  That's pretty big.  But hey, can't knock on them for generating a profitable business model.

I settled on raspberry and coffee -- a fruit flavor and a savory.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed about the raspberry was the unappealing gumminess of the texture, as if the mixture was half cream and half marshmallow Fluff (a substance perhaps unknown to Bay Area natives). It was excessively sugary, and combined with its weird texture I ended up throwing away half of it. The coffee was just an ordinary coffee ice cream -- a little too cold, a little too gritty (the beans should have been Turkish ground), and altogether uninspiring.\n\nWhat I see here, as I've seen in so many non-ice cream situations, is someone who is trying too hard to be different. The exotic flavors are weird for the sake of being weird, and the basic flavors are not executed to a standard commensurate with the prices. \n\nIn fact, my second visit was motivated much more by the devastating charms of the girl behind the counter (who had signed up her cousin between my first and second visits) than the quality of the product.

It was, surprisingly, good - and the flavors blended well together. I also sampled a few other flavors...\n\nI settled on 'Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee' (after seeing it on the menu at Mission Street Food, and after consuming a Blue Bottle latte earlier in the day from Mint Plaza - I just had to) and 'Jesus Juice'. And though I felt a bit guilty selecting 'Jesus Juice' as a flavor, I think it now may be my favorite: it combines red wine with Coke classic, and reminds me of amazingy ridiculousness of 7-11 Slurpees back in college in Chicago after a late night out clubbing downtown, making our way back from Wrigleyville to Evanston and catching the el - with our slurpees in tow.

It was so sunny--it would have been a crime not to indulge in ice cream! I wasn't the only one craving ice cream--I found myself in a sizeable line for ice cream at Humphry Slocombe.\n\nThe case was full of interesting and unusual flavor combinations, including McEvoy olive oil, Harvey Milk and Honey (with honey and graham crackers), Jesus Juice sorbet (with wine and coke), and of course Secret Breakfast (bourbon and corn flakes). \n\nAfter sampling a number of flavors, I decided to do a double scoop with peanut butter curry and Vietnamese iced coffee (made with Blue Bottle coffee). The peanut butter curry was sweet, with hints of spicy curry. The Vietnamese iced coffee was very rich, with a strong coffee flavor. The combination of the two was perfect.\n\nThe ice cream here was delicious--certainly worthy of the hype and the wait. The unique flavors might sound a little funky, but they're mighty tasty.

I always tend to leave with my taste buds more confused than happy. This place, however, has awesome flavors. The only disappointment was not being able to get a scoop of all the ones I liked during my taste test run. I decided on a scoop of the horchata-- yummy! My bro got a scoop of the secret breakfast, which I did not try because cornflakes in my ice cream did not sound appealing whatsoever. But then I tried a taste of his as we left and suddenly found myself glaring at my scoop of horchata with resentment. It's a decision I will regret until the next time I go and get a scoop for myself. It is, in fact, so good that even when his secret breakfast turned out to be the ''dirty breakfast'' (found a strand of hair.....), he couldn't find it in his heart to toss that cone away, neither did we encourage him to do so. Sigh. Instead, we dreamed of our next visit to Humphry's where hopefully we would get a clean secret breakfast. \n\nOne star knocked for the hair and that large disturbing painting/poster on the wall of a guy with what looks like bugs crawling all over his shirt.

We had just slithered over from Taqueria Vallarta after stuffing ourselves with cheap (and damn tasty!) tacos, seeking a little local sweetness to finish it off.   Of course, this was one of the few, rare sunny weekend days in San Francisco, so the line in front was a bit brutal.  Those sorts of lines lead to ice cream shortages, and I was distinctly deflated to hear that the vanilla (they had a specific name for it, which totally escapes me.  Frilly Foofy French Vanilla?) for my Tin Roof had just run out.\n\nThe strangeness begins when the cheery-in-the-onslaught-of-epic-Saturday-line fellow at the counter suggests instead making it with the Secret Breakfast ice cream (the aforementioned bourbon and corn flakes flavor).  Now, I initially thought it was simply bourbon-flavored ice cream, but after enjoying the custom Tin Roof, I suspect there might be a little something more in there.\n\nFirst off, their sundaes are HUGE.  You should order one expecting to share it with either a friend or your invisible imaginary friend.  Secondly, I've eaten entire quarts of Ben and Jerry's to no obvious effect (save the ones my physician will inform me of in about 10 years) -- but after the sundae, I felt... high?  I hadn't had a sugar(?) rush like that in YEARS.  It makes me want to go back for more.  Do you think they put MSG in their ice cream?\n\nRegardless of the ingredient list, I'll be back for the one-two punch of Mission Tacos and Narcotic Ice Cream very soon.", "author": "Adam E."}

Worse, this one's not moving.  A couple steps in behind us and we ask if it's worth the wait.  They respond that, even though they live in the area, they don't know - the wait is too long every time they come!  Minutes pass, I peer in the window.  Why is the same group still at the counter?  Why is the server rolling her eyes?  Why, dagnabbit, why?\n\nBecause, obviously, the ice cream is so good that you must try every flavor.  And for some tourists, that apparently means trying every flavor twice and then haggling over the non-negotiable prices.  I see your pain.  Oh, my darling servers, can I \"bounce\" them for you?  Please?\n\nSo, Humphry has no preview menu; the flavors are simply written on the dipping cabinet.  And the line starts moving once the regulars are engaged.  And yes, it is worth the wait.  \n\nThe ice cream was decadently rich, without being overbearing.  Nor did I detect any of the iciness found at Bi-Rite.  More so, the flavors were equally creative and included more textural adventures than many of the gelaterias around do.  Humphry exudes a cool attitude that settles right into the flavors and service.  They \"get it\" if you get it and then it all feels right.  The touristy glaze that wore across their faces leaves when they see how excited you are about their ice cream; no longer is their service indentured.\n\nYes, the Secret Breakfast and Jesus Juice were that good.

Plain ol' vanilla to me.\n2.  Secret breakfast:  Who would have ever thought of putting Bourbon in their ice cream?  Bonus points for that one. I liked how the corn flakes changed the texture of the smooth ice cream.\n3.  Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee:  I'm a java head and love coffee.  It was nice to taste bold coffee in an ice cream.  It was the best of both worlds.\n\nMy first experience at HS was good but I still prefer Bi-Rite to satisfy my ice cream sweet tooth.

My niece-who btw is only 5 years old-got 1 scoop of milk chocolate passion fruit.  \n\nMy niece did not like the milk chocolate passion fruit and so we gave her the hot chocolate with smoked salt which she enjoyed but I think it was because it tasted like regular chocolate to her.

Her favorite fruit since she was 4 is a pomegranate...and how many 5 year olds do you know even eat and like pomegranates?  I kind of liked the milk chocolate passion fruit but it was just way to much after a while! \n\nThe brown butter was  a disappointment and my sister agrees.  It has bits of butter??? I think it was just a little much.  I actually thought brown butter was going to be a \"safe\" flavor because brown butter is brown butter...its delicious!  I was wrong...I think it was a total fail for them to have those bits in.\n\nBlue bottle vietnamese coffee was actually enjoyable and I can't say anything bad about it.\n\nAll in all....I liked the hot chocolate with smoked salt the best!

Bourbon, cornflake chunks, and cream flavors were excellent, but maybe I was a bit too hungover to want to digest (pretty strong) bourbon flavor. \n\nPortions are very generous, and prices very reasonable.

They offer a gorging of flavors in all manners of experimentation and imagination: Secret Breakfast (bourbon and corn flakes), Jesus Juice (wine sorbet), Tahitian Vanilla, Brown Butter, Pumpkin 5 Spice, Cinnamon Brittle, Collaborative Evil Ale, Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, Blood Orange, Cayenne Cantaloupe, and my most beloved flavor the Balsamic Caramel (it sounds horrid, I know, but the experience is exquisite so difficult to describe.)\n\nThe rotate through the flavors, offering 12 a day, and a smattering of cleverly named sundaes. \n\nThe price is as high as the quality of cream you're consuming, but considering a scoop from Ben & Jerry's costs $5 for the smallest size... This costs less, like a dollar less. \n\nCouple downfalls: 1 - the line, most always out the door and slow as that diet you plan on starting after \"this last scoop.\" And offering 12 flavors seems too few to offer each day when people they've traveled a far distance to hit up this one location and are hunkering for that one they saw online. Oh yeah, it's also in one of the crimiest and grimiest parts of the Mission. Possibly a couple of shootings on those blocks in the last few months.

Big thanks to Frances for having Humphry Slocombe's olive oil ice cream on the menu (which was shockingly good), otherwise I'd still be in the dark. \n\nHands down, best ice cream in the city. Well how about this - just as good as Bi-Rite with a bit more originality (and no, it's not a competition between the two, just using Bi-Rite as reference). Every flavor is just a perfect manifestation of what that flavor is supposed to be. I know that sounds funny, because of course if they say it tastes like vanilla, it should taste like vanilla, but the flavors of the off-the-beaten-path choices (the maple walnut, or the balsamic caramel, or the ancho chocolate, or almost everything for that matter) are so pure it's unbelievable. \n\nAnd, have you heard about the duck fat pecan pies? Because, they're kind of a big deal. Rich, chewy, without being way too sugary-sweet (no, I'm sorry but they aren't smothered in caramel) - they will, single-handedly, be the downfall of my New Years weight loss regime. And the reason my bank account dwindles to nothing, because those little suckers are expensive! $5 for about 4-5 small bites. *shaking fist in air* Damn you duck fat for being so delicious!\n\nI've already gone out of my way, twice, in the rain, to stop by and get my unnecessary sugar fix.

I must admit, though, the power of placebo really got me here... after tasting nearly all their flavors, I settled for a scoop of the Harvey Milk and honey graham ice cream, thinking Harvey Milk must be a special culturing process for milk that made the texture different (clearly I'm not a SF native or else I'd have know that Harvey Milk was the first openly gay man elected to public office in California). I thought this was the best tasting ice cream with a superbly creamy texture that was perfectly complemented by the bits of graham cracker... then I found out that Harvey Milk was a person and I realized how much I built up expectations and reception in my head and the true power of placebo. A note about their Secret Breakfast... I don't get the hype... couldn't taste the bourbon and the corn flakes were just weird because you can't expect them to retain their crunch. \n\nI must say, though, their sorbet is excellent if you are looking for something extremely flavorful. I was handed a taste of the thai chili lime (without knowing what it was) and the flavors (I really thought I just ate a biteful of Thai food) literally exploded in my mouth. The cashier ended up telling me that they use double the amount of fresh fruit or ingredient called for to make the flavor stronger, which I do indeed agree with. But, beware, because it can really be over the top.\n\nAll in all, I do like this place a lot better than Bi-Rite (I couldn't taste the unique flavors in the ice cream), and I truly appreciate the smorgasbord of eclectic flavors (no much unlike Ici Ice Cream over in Berkeley).

The vietnamese coffee, however, was better.  Tasted like coffee so no complaints there, but it did leave a weird creamy/slimy coating on my tongue.  My aunt seems to think the fat content is a bigger. yuck.\n\nMy aunt got a small also.  She got brown butter (butla) flavor and balsamic caramel.  The brown butter was actually good.  It wasn't too sweet but it was still different.  The balsamic caramel was nasty though.  I mean, try it first because it tastes exactly like balsamic vinegar. where's the caramel?  She threw that flavor away, lol. \n\nMy Aunts Bf got a small of the vietnamese coffee and the secret breakfast (has alcohol).

This has your strangest combinations wrapped up in a scoop of delicious, homemade ice cream.\n\nFLAVORS: Gotta try the Secret Breakfast.  I'd tell you why, but then it wouldn't be a secret. =)  Just know that you'll like it, especially if you're a Guiness/brown beer fan.  Jesus Juice is great too, and no you don't have to be religious nor a Coke fan to enjoy it (I'm only sayin' because I was asked before).  The Chocolate Passionfruit is good if you like dark chocolate, which I'm actually not a huge fan of but I know my chocoholic girlfriends would LOVE.  My favorites are a toss up between the Olive Oil and Miso Pear flavor.  Both are so refreshing and light and... surprising.  I mean seriously, who would expect that the ingredients you'd normally find in a salad would taste good as ice cream?  The flavors change out... I'd say monthly, so you're likely to get a different assortment every time you go in.  Truly a unique tasting experience.  I'll be back to try more flavors.\n\nAMBIENCE: Not much to say.  A damn cute and tiny hole-in-the-wall with a cute modern navy blue storefront.  There's very limited space to sit down in there so it's likely best to just grab your ice cream and walk around the esoteric Mission area... or if it's a nice day, enjoy your ice cream at Dolores Park.\n\nPRICES: Ouch.  Ok, I had to take a star off for this one.  At nearly $4 for a small scoop, albeit a very good scoop, of ice cream, this place is probably best as an occasional treat.  Nonetheless, this is a novel post-dinner date idea for the man trying to impress his lady of how worldly he is.  Or, depending on the lady, might freak her out that you're the type who eats peanut brittle with bacon in it.  You make the call.\n\nPARKING: Yeah... the Mission doesn't have a lot of that.  You could try the lot on 21st Street and Valencia and just walk the 8 blocks to get ice cream.  Or you could pray to the Parking God that a space on the street will open up for you. Or here's a novel idea - the place is about 8 blocks from the 24th and Mission BART station.  Probably the best option for getting yourself there.", "author": "Catherine C."}

The ice cream is super creamy and lightly sweet, and then the hints of bourbon come through -- strong enough to taste, but not strong enough to overtake the sweet cream taste.  Then you get a nice surprise, the corn flake, which is like a candied cookie bite.  It's like getting a nice crispy cereal piece in the middle of a sweet bowl of milk.

This is a feat, and I suspect they're on to something.\n\nP.S.  All this talk of which is better, H.S. or Bi-Rite is beside the point.  Who cares! We have two amazing ice cream purveyors in the same neighborhood.  Do we care which is better, puppies of kittens?  Of course not! (Kittens and puppies cuddling in a basket is best.)\nP.P.S. I crunched some more numbers and 27% of their flavors are liquor based, this is true business savvy and should be taught in MBA programs.", "author": "Kathryn M."}

I was skeptical when I heard about it.  Mix booze into ice cream, call it secret, and they will come is what I thought was happening here...but people, let me tell you, Secret Breakfast is the shiZZ with capital Z's.  The little flecks of corn flakes mixed with just a slight taste of bourbon without too much bite made Secret Breakfast one of the highlights of my trip to San Francisco and has me ready to ask our local ice creameries to make something similar.  I also had the Fluffernutter which was a great pairing with the Secret Breakfast.\n\nThe place isn't overpriced, the service was exceptionally good for being staffed by a hipster, and the locale itself was very nice.  Overall, I think Humphry Slocombe, slightly edges out Bi-Rite, but just barely.  Thanks Tess and David for recommending I check this place it, totally worth it.", "author": "Tony R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-17", "description": "Stupid Slocombe. Opening up after I leave. What kind of deal is that? That I have to come to 24th & Harrison every time I'm back in town to visit mi familia? I guess that will have to be.\n\nWhat's strange is that almost NONE of my friends who still live in SF have ever been here. I chalk that up to sheer laziness, though. When they're walking distance to Bi-Rite, Mitchell's, Maggie Mudd's, Naia, wherever - why even bother?\n\nWell, Humphry Slocombe is worth the bother, so I guess it's their loss, my gain.\n\nDUDE, GET ON WITH IT ALREADY! HOW'S THE ICE CREAM?\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGreat, for the most part. In the multiple times I've been here, I've had the chance to snarf down a diverse assortment of scoops, including:\n\n* Salt & Pepper - Seriously, if someone extracted the essence from a salt & black pepper-flavored kettle chip and injected it into ice cream, this would be it. And for me, it worked. Perfect balance of creaminess, salt, pepper, and sweet. Big fan of this flavor, and the texture was just right. Sure, it's a \"novelty\" flavor but it's become a favorite of mine.\n\n* Secret Breakfast - Bourbon & cornflakes. Yeah, I know. I see you going, \"ewwww.\" Stop that grimace now and put a spoon of this in your mouth and shut up. You won't be sorry.\n\n* Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee - Exactly what it says it is. Tastes as good as you'd think it would, too.\n\n* Jesus Juice Sorbet - Coke Classic blended with red wine. Sounds like it would be one scoop-sized holy party foul in the mouth but it worked somehow. Like magic.\n\n* Others I've had but am too lazy to expound on right now are McEvoy olive oil, peanut butter curry, hibiscus beet, thai chili lime, and balsamic caramel. I liked all these flavors (yep, even the hibiscus beet sorbet) except the balsamic caramel, which is one of their more popular flavors. Don't know if it was because didn't really challenge my taste buds or if the balsamic-caramel combo just didn't work for me. Oh well. One \"eh\" out of many surprisingly interesting and stellar flavors isn't too bad of track record.\n\nANYTHING ELSE VISITORS SHOULD KNOW?\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nHumphry Slocombe is not in a touristy part of town, unless you're doing that \"murals of the Mission\" walking tour dealio. The 24th & Mission BART station is about a 5-8 minute walk away, or usually you can easily find nearby daytime street parking, even on sunny, hot weekends (far cry from the situation near Bi-Rite).\n\nI've never found the lines here more than a few people deep, which is pretty refreshing. There is some bar stool seating along the window inside and also a few small tables and chairs on the sidewalk, or you could sit on the tree planters. Or just wander around and take in the Mission. Unless you can't eat ice cream and walk at the same time. That may cause some issues.\n\nIN THE END...\n--------------------\nI'd strongly recommend Humphry Slocombe for folks who are open to expanding their boundaries with ice cream flavors. Sure, there are plenty of gourmet creameries/gelaterias in the Bay these days, but these guys definitely come up with some of the more inventive combinations that I would never have thought of myself. They definitely take more risks, and while sometimes their flavors fall flat, for the most part those risks are well rewarded. And I like the texture and consistency of their ice cream - not too soft or overly creamy - and the ingredients for each flavor hold their own.\n\nAm I bummed that I only get to eat here a few times a year? You bet. But then again, maybe that's a good thing. I can't buy bigger pant sizes every 3 months. I have a budget to keep and all that.\n\nI'll refrain from awarding all 5 stars until I've tried about 10 more flavors, because I'm a glutton that way. Gives me motivation for those future trips...\n\n4.4 stars for now.", "author": "Mr K."}

I reeeeeeally don't get the hype.\n\nI guess the people who like Humphry Slocombe are those that like to drink for breakfast and like to mix really odd flavors into their ice cream.  Maybe I'm just not experimental enough (I never did try the beef ice cream at that little store in Taipei).\n\nFirst of all, what happened to selection?  That is first and foremost one of the biggest factors of any ice cream parlor.  \"31 flavors\"... that's what made Baskin Robbins famous, isn't it?  What's up with this \"we only serve 12 flavors a day\" bull-crap?  Bi-Rite and Mitchell's both have a much better selection than this place.\n\nI tried the Secret Breakfast.  One spoonful and I thought I felt like I should be drunk, except I wasn't.  All I tasted was bourbon - what happened to the corn flakes?  Don't get me wrong - I'm a big scotch fan, but I don't think it's something I want as ice cream.\n\nThe root beer tasted nothing like root beer (but pretty similar to bad root beer candy that I've had before).  The olive oil had a lemony flavor (but lacked olive oil flavor, oddly enough).  The Vietnamese coffee was the only flavor I tried that I remotely liked, so I got a single of that (I'm still kicking myself for not getting the kid's size).\n\nAfter finishing all of my coffee ice cream, my tongue went numb.  And not in a good way.  Maybe my body is allergic to sub-par ice cream?  I'm not really allergic to much, so I didn't understand why my tongue felt so funny.  I went to Blue Bottle later and had their drip coffee and my tongue did not reject that, so it wasn't the coffee.\n\nMaybe I should have gone for the vanilla.  However, another thing that I noticed was that the ice cream here had kind of an odd consistency.  You know how most ice cream is smooth and creamy?  This wasn't smooth at all.  Also, it was overly sweet - or at least the coffee one was.  As if adding more sugar makes up for the lack of flavor.\n\nI guess it should have tipped us off when we came here at 2:30 on a Sunday afternoon and there wasn't a line that this place really isn't that great.\n\n2 stars, because no one had food poisoning (but my weird allergic reaction is questionable).

On our first day getting into the city (Friday)  I had to do my, \"got to do and got to try list\".  Humphry Slocombe was one of those to do's.  \n\nLooked up the address through GPS and it was in the not so \"safe\" looking areas of the city.  But that didn't stop me.  =)  So, found the place very easily and got a parking spot right in the front (which was a loading zone (BF was in the car waiting just in case the meter person was coming around)).  \n\nThe line was out the door, but not ridiculously long.  THANK GOODNESS!  So waited patiently and was trying to look at the chalk board of the selection of ice cream for the week.  They also write it directly on the glass of the freezer.  As I was waiting I referred to my good ole YELP mobile to see what people were recommending.  2 flavors were \"Secret Breakfast\" and the \"Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee\".  So, I got the BF the Secret Breakfast, because I read the reviews that it was made with alcohol.  I knew he would like that. ;)  I got the coffee.\n\nSo I asked for 2 scoops of the Secret Breakfast (pretty big scoops) in a sugar cone and 1 scoop of the coffee in a cup.  It cost a grand total $5.50.  I was like...\"AWESOME\"!  For the price its a \"so coming back again\" feeling.\n\nAs I handed the icecream to the BF he was like..\"is there alcohol in this\"  I laughed and said..\"Yup\".  He was in love!  \n\nMine was stronger than the usual coffee ice cream.  But still delish.  As I took the bite of ice cream off the spoon it tasted a little grainy.  After pulling the spoon out of my mouth,  surprise, surprise that the spoon was eco friendly and it also said  \"bio-degradable\" and so was the cup when I took a closer look at it.  There's always a different taste whenever its an eco friendly product.  That didn't diminish the taste at all.  As I kept eating my coffee ice cream, the roof of my mouth tasted/felt somewhat weird.  Weird meaning it felt a tad greasy after each bite.  I'm not sure what they put in the ice cream to make it feel that way, but I can only assume the cream from the coffee?  Will be coming back anyways to try out the other flavors.\n\nThe shop itself is small.  Looked like they also offered chocolate chip cookies too.  Clean, white and blue.  The seating was bar/counter style that faced the window.  They also had a small water dispenser in the corner of the shop.  I'd rather get my ice cream and go so that it wouldn't feel as crowded, especially if there was a line outside the door.  \n\nThey also do offer sundaes.  Might try one of those next time.  So, if you're in the area and craving an \"alcoholic\" flavored ice cream, you know where to go:  Humphry Slocombe! =D", "author": "Noemi M."}

It's creamy, rich and delicious, but not overpowering.\n\nThey use Straus milk! Even with no Yelp reviews, I would have visited for some ice cream.

Very different from Bi-Rite (stop comparing to Bi-Rite folks... their philosophy around flavors and approach here is just so different from Bi-Rite I think it's unfair to compare) - but very pleasing in its own right.  I agree with one poster that the Vietnamese Coffee ice cream was the \"best coffee ice cream ever\".  Yes, that WAS the bomb - and definitely the best I've ever had and I LOVE coffee ice cream.  The Cinnamon Brittle I had was also excellent and not too sweet - much more of the cinnamon and nutmeg flavors which had me very happy, although a bit more brittle \"crunch\" would have been good.  The \"proscuitto\" and \"olive oil\" flavors were a bit too overpowering for me... but again, back to personal taste :)\n\nAdmittedly, I find almost every flavor I have at Bi-Rite extremely appealing and tasty... not so here.

Mainly because they are all pretty good! I don't really have a loyalty to any specific ice creamery but Humphry Slocombe got me very excited with their exotic, unusual and delicious flavors. \n\nAfter dinner on 24th Street, I saw this blue little store and before even reading the store sign, I knew what it was. I've had H.S. bookmarked on my yelp since the first days it opened and here it was, right before my eyes! There was no way I could not go in. \n\nI sampled the Olive Oil, Secret Breakfast and Miso White Peach. I could have easily eaten full sized scoops of ALL of them but I opted for the Miso White Peach. I think we're all familiar with the savory Miso soup served at Japanese restaurants but the Miso used for sweet ice cream added a great texture and nutty flavor to the peach ice cream. It was surprising and wonderfully tasty! \n\nMy theory is if they can make miso and olive oil taste great, of course the rest of their flavors will be delicious... if not better.

Where I live in North Bernal, I'm close to at least three wonderful and innovative places.  But when H.S. opened a few years ago, it was the closest of all and I was excited.  They have not disappointed.  I love that they take risks, and often succeed.  While Jesus Juice, coke and red wine, was *not* to my taste - it at least has a fun name, and I enjoyed a sample - just no more than that.  Other flavors, though, have knocked my socks off: Vietnamese Coffee, Salted Watermelon sorbet, Brown Butter, and even Candy Cap (mushroom) flavor I had tonight.  Tasted like maple, you'd *never* guess it was based on mushroom flavoring.\n\nWhen I went in tonight, I was on a mission.  I'd had a particularly crummy day, and had even been reduced to tears.  To cheer myself up, I went for an ice cream sundae - for dinner.  I stopped by, and got the sundae with bananas, butterscotch and marshmallow topping - with vietnamese coffee and candy cap ice creams. The flavors combined were the bomb. Very sweet, yes - but just what the doctor ordered.  My husband got chocolate fudge sorbet.\n\nOn top of this, the staff gets extra thumbs up. Always nice, but they outdid themselves. I happened to mention my crappy day story, and the lovely woman ringing me up said that I deserved my sundae for free.  I was dumb-founded and, for once, speechless. I almost lost a few more tears, just for the simple kindness of it. I kicked in a few bucks for a tip, but I also promised myself to get this review done ASAP.  They deserve the 5 stars for sure.

After trying a few samples out, I settled on Secret Breakfast, with a contrasting sorbet of Limoncello.\n\nThe nice thing about HS is that the ice cream and the sorbet are both so creamy and smooth, they simply roll down your throat like they were always supposed to be there. The limoncello was peppered with chunks of lemon, and unlike other sorbets, the flavours were pretty muted. Normally, I like a lemon sorbet to pucker me up like no other, but I did dig this one. It was not to rock and roll levels, but it was definitely an understated treat. \n\nNow, on the other hand, the Secret Breakfast had me on my knees. The bourbon simply hums throughout the ice cream on a note that was just in tune with every taste fibre of my being.

My dad in particular is a great fan of ice cream and my parents make fabulous ice cream them selves, so I thought they might like to try a new place that has a modern twist on an old classic. It was incredibly salty and the bourbon was really weak tasting compared to the first time I tasted it so the consistency once again was not there. \n\nWhen there are places in the city that have been around for my entire life time like Mitchell's and Swenson's I feel that the novelty of the unusual flavors is not enough to inspire longevity.

First off, many of my Bay Area friends were in need of a new dessert place. Fortunately one of the Bay Area Yelpers, who I follow reviewed it and enjoyed it. Secondly, whenever there's a line for something chances are (overhyped or not) the quality of the product is worth trying, at least once. \n\nHere's what I sampled and ordered at this spot:\n\nSamples:\n\n-Tahitian Vanilla\n-Something mixed with Prosciutto (couldn't recall the other flavor in hybrid)\n\nOrders:\n\n-1 Scoop of The Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee\n-1 Scoop of The Secret Breakfast\n\nThe Tahitian, was decent had Vanilla, with a bit of spicyness. The Prosciutto mix was alright but a bit too salty for me to enjoy.\n\nSo far, I was becoming disappointed then I asked them what the popular flavors were and first came up the Vietnamese Coffee. It was right on the money, sweet with that Caffeine rush after taste. Made me feel like I was in a Vietnamese Coffee house without the Blue Balls attached. Next up the Secret Breakfast (which was really Bourbon and Corn Flakes) surprisingly, I didn't think this combination would make sense at all. After one lick, I was hooked like a crack addict. The bourbon hits first, strong but the subtle corn flake bits balance out with the creamy waves splashing on the tongue.\n\nThe line wasn't too ridiculous and the service was surprisingly friendly to my non-hipster/artist self. I guess it helps having messing hair and a random panda t-shirt to fit the bill. Speaking the bill, It only costs me about $7.00 dollars plus tax and tip. The seating could be better, but hey the business just started and rent must be a pain in SF. Overall, the Mission definitely has one neighborhood spot that shouldn't be going away for a while. \n\nProbably on a future trip, I'll check out Bi-Rite Creamery (a spot a few Yelpers and friends urged me to go). Overall, great job Humphry, now survive the business Hump year and recession to become more of a winner. On a side note, there are some really good Hawaiian Corn Flake Cookies (can't recall the name) but it would go well with the Secret Breakfast that's for sure.\n\nP.S. What gives with the Fishbone Sign the Google Person donated in the front?", "author": "Ryan M."}

I usually am not a fan of coffee ice cream, but this particular flavor was so rich and decadent that I couldn't resist going back for more. The secret breakfast was great as well. If I didn't read the description I wouldn't be able to tell that the ice cream was bourbon flavored but I loved the corn flakes in it.

Or the Jesus Juice flavor (red wine + coke-- surprisingly tasty!).  \n\nThe Secret Breakfast (from The List) was pretty good, and there was a distinct flavor of bourbon.  But I settled on getting the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee scoop in a cone.  Strong coffee flavor, which was great.  I may not be a coffee drinker, but when it comes to ice cream, coffee is my flavor of choice!  Why does such a seemingly small amount of ice cream end up being SO much?  And by that, I mean so MUCH DELICIOUSNESS?  I was with friends, so I got to try carrot mango (carroty, but since carrot is a sweet root to begin with, not too outlandish), and honey thyme (yum-- light in flavor but sweet enough to satisfy).  \n\nWith the summer months fast approaching (granted, it's SF so it's never going to become broiling-ly hot, but still), Humphry Slocombe is  the perfect place to get that cold sweet ice cream we all crave.", "author": "Jeanne Y."}

In my mind, ice cream is the cure-all for anything that brings someone down, a sort of magical mood lifter of sorts. And for the most part, it doesn't matter whether the ice cream is served at a fancy restaurant with an acclaimed pastry chef or from Rite Aide, I love it all (there are a few exceptions though, Indian style ice cream being one of them). So when we decided to stop by Humphrey Slocombe for a quick treat while we were in SF this past weekend, I was looking forward to something cold and delicious. What I got was mostly just cold... and sort of weird... but not that delicious.\n\nHumphrey Slocombe is touted for their unique flavors (Secret Breakfast- Bourbon and Corn Flakes, Chocolate and Passion Fruit, Salted Licorice, Balsamic Caramel, Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, Olive Oil, Creme Fraiche...) and seems to have quite a following in the city. I wanted to make sure I got the perfect flavor so asked for a taste of 5-6 varieties that seemed the most interesting. After tasting each one, I had a really hard time deciding which one I wanted, which is normal since I usually want everything, but this time it was because I didn't really like any of them and couldn't fathom finishing a whole scoop (I can finish an entire gallon of ice cream in one sitting sometimes, so this was definitely strange). I finally settled on a kid size single scoop of the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, only because it seemed to be the most harmless choice.\n\nI think the overall impression I had was that the flavors were unbalanced. Most of them had at least two flavor components but one always overwhelmed the other. The Balsamic Caramel was too vinegary and you couldn't really taste the Caramel... The Secret Breakfast tasted mostly of Bourbon (I actually hated this one) and I wasn't sure there were even any Corn Flakes in the ice cream itself. Olive Oil had a citrus-y taste with a denser texture but the only part of it that was reminiscent of Olive Oil was that it was sort of unctuous, like Indian Ice Cream (which is not a good thing in my book).

I was very excited to try Humphry Slocombe after seeing it on the Food Network and researching all its unique creations online, but sadly, I think the flavors are a little too outrageous for me. Maybe I am just not adventurous enough, but they offer very radical combinations i.e. lemon basil, salted licorice, and olive oil, without any of the standards to fall back on. However, they unquestionably use authentic and fresh ingredients, because I could definitely taste every component of sorbet. For example, the Jesus Juice emanated powerfully of red wine and Coca-Cola. Stupidly, I went for a scoop of Szechuan Strawberry without tasting it beforehand and realizing that the \"Szechuan\" part denoted spicyness. Thus, an unexpected and very odd hot herb-y aftertaste while eating a cup caused me to become very puzzled and uncomfortable, until a friend pointed out my oversight.", "author": "Amy G."}

Whoever is in charge is really creative. \n- They let you taste as many as you need to make up your mind, which is a total plus - from those I tried, I got Milk Chocolate Malt and Cinnamon Brittle. They were a gift for my post-dinner pallet. \n\nIn depth:\n\n- More than the off-hand and funky flavors, the ice cream itself was special. Creamy and thick, I felt like I was getting some quality stuff. I tried two and got a small with two flavors. In the end, I got to tast 4 or their 8 flavors, so I feel like I got a good feel for things. You should, too. \n\n- Milk Chocolate Malt is probably the least exciting flavors they offered, but it was absolutely delicious - especially if your into a soft creamy chocolate. It was my fav, for sure. \n\n- Cinnamon Brittle was not too strong, but tasted kind of like Fruity Pebbles (weird, I know - but others agreed with me). I wouldn't get it alone, but it was the perfect complement with my chocolate. I recommend getting a small, cause it was the ideal amount after dinner. \n\n- I also tried the Peanut Butter Curry, which was fantastic. I just wasn't feeling like eating curry after BBQ, so I skipped it. My other test flavor was the Secret Breakfast, which is a mix of corn flakes and burbon - definitely not my cup of tea. If you want something with a kick, go for it. Just not on my list of best ice creams ever. \n\n- Overall, loved it for many reasons, but mostly cause the ice cream was quality and filled up.

On the wall above the window and seating is the bust of a two headed siamese calf (calves?)\n\nI love that the flavors are written on the glass of the fridge, and quick discription of what it was in parenthesis. I was pretty set on trying the blue bottle vietnamese coffee flavor, but upon reading \"jesus juice,\" i had to try it. Didnt quite knock my socks off--not what I imagined, so I ordered a single scoop of the coffee. It is amazing good. The best coffee ice cream I've everrrr had. If it was more accessible to me, it might be my favorite.\n\nI forgot what flavor the guy got, but the flavor was a bit odd and strong for me. He seem to really like it though.\n\nThere's parking on the street. We parked a block down, but right in front is a quick park area for you to run in, order and take a few licks/finish your ice cream.

Warm, but a little breezy day in the City. You spot a cute place with a blue awning and bike over. A short line is out the door so you wonder what the big fuss is about. Once seeing all the ice cream flavors, you are confused whether to feel disgusted or excited. The flavors are so exotic and unconventional! You give them a try and order the peanut butter, vanilla, and ancho chocolate. One bite and you are in HEAVEN. The creamy ice cream melts in your mouth and is one of those foods you can't help but smiling after eating! You feel like a young kid again! \n\nAfter tasting Humphry's, I am hooked. Ice cream is now never the same for me. I can never fully enjoy my big ice cream from Safeway without being reminded of how Humphry's is waaaaaay better. It's the most elite ice cream of all.

That would be disgusting!\n\nCall me old school, but I still like my Strawberry from Bi-Rite, Lychee from Polly Ann's, and Cherry Garcia from Ben and Jerry's.  \n\nIf you want something to move your trunk, try my favorite flavor, the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, which has a smooth presence of condensed milk along with a strong coffee taste.  My second runner up is the Balsamic Caramel.  Third is Chocolate Chip Cookie.\n\nI have yet to try their Bacon Peanut Brittle or the Thai Chile Lime Sorbet, and I look forward to returning for some more fancy ice cream, if my frozen yogurt craving doesn't get in the way.\n\nA single cup or cone costs under $4.  The bad news is that their ice cream melts quickly on a normal day in San Francisco.  The day that I buy more than a quart of ice cream from HS is when I shall change my ratings to 5 stars.  I am sure HS will come up with something brilliant to surprise me.\n\nMeanwhile...\n\nI scream.  You scream.

They have outrageously adventurous ice cream and sorbet flavors. Where else can you get \"Salt & Pepper\" or \"Strawberry Jalapeno\"? Sundaes, cones, and toppings too! But since the ice cream and sorbet are so packed full of flavor you don't really need any additions.\n\nMy first time here I didn't feel ready to plunge into the deep end of ice cream exploration, I chose a cup of \"Poppyseed Kumkwat\" and \"Coconut Sorbet\". It was devine! The Sorbet was smooth and addicting while the Kumkwat was buttery. The flavors are so satisfying I wouldn't recommend getting anything more than a cup.

Of course, I had already eaten my share but my love of the frozen stuff would not have stopped me from eating hers. \n\nI love it so much that I often have debates about it.

San Francisco being the food-stuff capital that it is, it's not surprising that a spot like Humphry Slocombe (pronounced hump-ree slock-jaw) with its olive oil, miso pear, I.P.A. beer flavored creations exist. At first the flavors sound like a novelty or a dare or just a bad idea, but after tasting them I dig 'em. \n\nI had the Secret Breakfast (Bourbon & Corn Flakes) with a scoop of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee ice cream. She had Miso Pear & Olive Oil. All were great. Already I am looking forward to sampling some more of their wares. \n\nWhile we are on the topic of all things Ice Cream, have you noticed the Red Triangle of this glorious stuff that has emerged in the Mission/Bernal Area??

TIP: This place is cash only.  Had we done our research, we would have brought cash.  If you need an ATM, there's a Mexican restaurant with an ATM inside about a block away.\n\nWhat works in theory doesn't always pan out in reality.  I tried the Thai Chili Lime which was just plain weird.  Call me old-fashioned, but I'm not really one for spicy ice cream.  I tried the Pepper Mint as well, not to be confused with Peppermint.  This one had cubes of pepper in it.  Again, not down with spicy ice cream.\n\nMy bf got the Blueberry Nectarine Yogurt and the Chocolate.  Both were passable in my opinion.  The Blueberry Nectarine was too tart and the Chocolate was too rich, though, my bf, a chocolate fiend, seemed to like it a lot.\n\nI ended up getting a scoop each of the Secret Breakfast (cornflakes and bourbon) and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee.  The SB was too alcoholic for me, which says a lot because Lord knows I love my bourbon.  But I ended up not being able to eat it, and it made my tongue feel weird.  But the Vietnamese Coffee redeemed Humphry Slocombe, and it was almost as refreshing as the real thing.  I'd come back again just for this flavor, but probably not before getting Birite's Strawberry ice cream to which I've developed an addiction.", "author": "Kira K."}

Good as a taster, but a whole scoop was a bit much.\nOolong - like sweet oolong tea.  Good, not great.\nSecret breakfast - Really??  I honestly don't get the hype.  Maybe because I'm not a bourbon drinker, but not my favorite.\nOlive oil vanilla - Not very exciting. Tastes like it sounds.  \nStrawberry with black olive - probably my favorite of the bunch, but only because it tasted like fresh strawberries and you couldn't really taste the olive.\n\nOverall, I felt they were trying to be too ambitious with their funky flavors and just ended up with funk, kind of like the Harry Potter Jelly Bellies.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-29", "description": "I read a Yahoo article from a very misinformed writer stating that Humphry Slocombe was the best ice cream parlor in San Francisco.  To be quite frank, NO.\n\nOn a day of an \"U-turning\" tutoring session for Kder, the one blemish on her otherwise steller Earnhardt-esque driving resume, we decoded to cool down at Humphrey Slocombe nearby.  I had spent a good 10 minutes trying to get her to flip a bitch at various junctures, however, her stout fear and refusal led way to stubborn resolve and we drove in a straight line for nearly a mile, with her ignoring my every command.  My throat was horse and parched and her armpits were in need of cooling and more importantly, NAPKINS.  Humphry Slocombe does not have an extensive library of flavours.  I assume they have a couple staples and flavours that change daily.  I tried to erase the endless hype this place received and used jedi mind tricks to delete comments I have heard over the years from my memory banks.  i tried the flufferbutter (penut butter and marshmallow) which tasted alrite.  It was like eating penut butter.  I could not really taste the marshmallow.  I tried the watermelon sorbet which was also average.  It tasted like icy watermelon smoothies my mom makes.  It was very light on the tongue and you could tell they used natural ingredients  I settled on the sea salted chocolate while Kder got a scoop of McEvoy olive oil.  \n\nThe verdict - They gave very generous single scoops of ice cream.  They are not stingy at all.  I have to note, for KDer's sake and her passion for waste management, that they have a green ideology.  Instead of giving out plastic disposable spoons, they use metal spoons which can be washed and reused.  Despite their generosity and tree hugging ways, their ice cream is average.  The sea-salt chocolate was so salty.  After dragging my tongue across the surface of the ice cream, I thought I was eating a scoop of whiskey ice cream for some reason.  However, the trick with Humphy Slocombe is not to take breaks between licks.  You have to continually lick and soon, your tongue becomes numb and everything tastes good and sweet.  When I tried KDer's olive oil, I bert stared her.  It was as if I was eating frozen virgin olive oil.  However, she advised me again to not take dainty licks.  Stuffing my face in it as one would do a clean shaven box, I began to see the different flavours.  I tasted orange and some floral flavoring.  Overall, I was less than impressed.  Some people may like this place just due to their unique flavors.  They have an ice cream that has bourbon and cornflakes.  Some people just love shit that is just \"weird\" aka i'm so indie because I wear toms and sperrys as my night slippers and I listen to bands nobody knows like Mumford and Sons (which I love btw...their album is one of best I've heard in a while..just wanted to give them a little advertisement) when in fact, everybody knows or has them.  I am sure if they advertised an ice cream blended with organic grass (blades of grass plucked from the shrubs outside), that would rapidly become an SF top flavor.  Call me boring, call me old fashioned, but good 'ole Dryer's ice cream is more savory for me.  Try their caramel delight.  I'd rather have that any day of the week save one...that day is reserved for Bi-Rite salted caramel.", "author": "Brian V."}

As to where in the top 10, that would place, that depends on the rater's taste preference. HS specializes in interesting flavor combinations - I'm serious about that description. Want salt and pepper ice cream? Got it. Thought oolong was a tea? Wrong, it's also a flavor. I think the simplest ice cream is Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee, which by the way is delicious; I now feel the need to try Blue Bottle coffee. I also suggest the balsamic caramel ice cream. It does a twist to caramel the same as Bi-rite did, only Bi-rite is salted caramel, which I prefer a bit more. \n\nWhy the 3 stars as opposed to 4 or 5? I think the combinations get a bit too weird for me. I understand that being in SF, I should be proud that a place serves foie gras ice cream but I guess I am traditional enough that I want flavors that somewhat resemble classic flavors. Avocado ice cream (from Mitchell's) is about as far off the beaten path as I go. I also took off a star because while the website lists quite a few flavors, they don't serve all of those at once.

You can now see the towns crackheads, hipsters & pimps walking down the street while you enjoy your ice cream cone. And I can totally say this since I am a crackheaded hipster pimp myself. And yes, i'm totally playing. So more about the decor, they have Campbell's soup paintings with a couple of their ice cream flavors as soup flavors (see photos or just visit), and there's an interesting painting of a wrestler or burgler wearing a mask, who looks like he's about to grab someone out their car! I found these paintings, which are the only paintings here, to be very fun. They have a water dispenser next to a bunch of stacked plastic cups which is nice because I know I love a drink of water when i'm having ice cream. They have a bathroom which is convinent. And last but not least, they have a few bamboo plants spread out in their little store. As you can see, the decor isn't fancy at all, but it doesn't have to be because the ice cream is absolutely scrumptious! I mean, after having some, I thought, this place is perfect. The ice cream was wild & the decor matched it all of a sudden. I'd say the one word to describe this place is unique. \nAfter sampling practically everything in the case with their tiny cute spoons, I decided on a scoop of Harvey Milk & Honey and a scoop of their famous Secret Breakfast. The Harvey Milk & Honey is the one I keep thinking about :) It tastes of sweet honey that explodes in your mouth, sweet creamy vanilla ice cream & chewy hunks of honeycomb (i think, whatever it is, it's heaven). Ahhhhhh, now that my mouth is watering.... \nThe Secret Breakfast is of course vanilla ice cream, frosted flakes & bourbon, and I have to say I'd love to have this for breakfast any day. The bourbon is really shocking at first lick.... tantalizing your tastebuds, then, you learn to enjoy it. So much that you wonder why it's gone so fast. Well that's in my case. Basically, I was excited to go to Humphrey Slocombe for the very first time (thanks to my wonder twin who popped my Humphrey Slocombe cherry!) and I was very pleased. \nIt's not the same ol' rocky road, strawberry, or caramel type flavors, but Szechaun Strawberry, Cayenne Canteloupe, Salt and Pepper, Foie Gras, White Chocolate Lavener, and other awesome flavors.

We ate the ice cream (a beet flavored one... yum), loved it, but still weren't sure if it was worth waiting 30 minutes. The NEXT time we went, there was NO line... we walked right up to the counter, sampled some flavors (they'll let you try almost all of them, which is awesome) and ordered. This second experience (with little to no line) made me LOVE this place. We got the Vietnamese Coffee (amazing!) and the Bourbon with Corn Flakes (double amazing).

They offer a number of novel flavors you wouldn't expect at an ice cream shop.  For instance, I never expected to try prosciutto ice cream before (that was a bizarre experience, still not sure what happened there).  I came for the Secret Breakfast, but ended up trying some of the other flavors.  Other than the Boccalone Prosciutto, I really enjoyed everything I tried. \n\nMy favorite was probably the Vietnamese Coffee.  Super strong, but delicious.  I also never thought I'd say something like this, but I really enjoyed the Jesus Juice. Red wine and coke sorbet. Soooo good.  The carrot mango was refreshing and the honey thyme was also solid ice cream.  As for the Secret Breakfast? I liked it, but all I could taste was the alcohol.  It's very strong, but I'd still recommend it. It was delish.\n\nIn the end, it was good ice cream and a unique experience and I'd love to come back another time to try some of their other flavors.", "author": "Alea G."}

I've had this place bookmarked for a while, so I was really excited when a friend took me here by chance.  The ice-cream itself was top rate and the line moved quickly.  I've never held \"cash only\" against an ice cream parlor, so no stars subtracted for that.  You should certainly make the effort to try Humphry Slocombe, but it might not become your go to for gourmet ice-cream.  If you are trying to decide between HS and Bi-Rite, it would be entirely legit to go to which ever is closer. \n\nThe only other note I have for HS--and I fully realize that this won't be an issue for most sane people--is an irritation that is once again discursive.  I think some \"Joshua Generation\" type person might gawk at their flavor combinations, but do those people frequent Harrison and 24th?  I feel like we are at a point where not only do we all know that balsamic describes a vinegar, we're also all perfectly accustomed to associating it with dessert.  They write things next to their flavors like, \"Yeah, we went there.\"  And I'm once again staring at a business asking, \"you know where you are, right?\"  I think they would present themselves better if they just said, \"here's some chocolate curry ice cream,\" rather than, \"Oh snap, chocolate and curry? No we didn't! \" \n\nBut that doesn't even factor into the 4 not 5 star final verdict.  To get to 5 stars they need to not run out of flavors, especially when I was there at 3:30-ish in the afternoon on a Saturday.  I appreciate \"small batch\" and freshness, but ice cream is one of those foods that \"freezes beautifully\" for at least a couple of days.

The ice cream is obviously made in small batches with high quality ingredients by someone with a passion for ice cream and a sense of humor.  \n\nExpect to find about 12 flavors (the most popular flavors, e.g., Secret breakfast, will always be available).  Once the sundae prep station is up and running, you'll be able to add homemade toppings like marshmallow fluff to your ice cream (sorry, it's not self serve).  They'll also have homemade cones.  \n\nA single (1 - 2 flavors) will set you back $3.25, a kid's size is $2.25.\n\nFlavors I tried:\n* Thai chile lime sorbet - complex and interesting, the lime makes it refreshing while the coconut adds to the richness, the chile leaves you with a subtle heat (it's not that spicy but you do notice it)\n* Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee - loved this one because of the strong coffee flavor and the sweetness of the condensed milk, smooth texture, bold flavor.  I heard they were going to serve this at Blue Bottle.\n* Guinness gingerbread - deep, spicy, rich flavor with chunks of gingerbread, yum \n* Secret breakfast - tastes like bourbon mixed with cream, I can see why some people would like it but it wasn't really my cup of tea, didn't get any cornflakes in my sample \n* Straus yogurt - icier and softer than the other flavors, nice and tarty but there were some ice chunks.  It's tarter than Harmony Yogurt and has more sugar than Culture (they also use Straus Yogurt in their plain fro-yo).  \n* Olive oil - different from what I expected, the olive oil flavor isn't strong, it has orange and lemon zest but not so much of it that it tastes like lemon or orange ice cream, it's more subtle than that yet flavorful \n\nMy favorites (for now) are the olive oil and Vietnamese coffee.  I'm looking forward to trying their other flavors (there are currently 50), including rhubarb, blood orange, Meyer lemon, dulce de leche, foie gras and peanut butter curry.  \n\nGo now before the lines become too crazy.

So it pains me to give bad reviews, especially when they are based mostly upon poor service.  But my experience at Humprey Slocombe just can't be ignored, and I'm sure the owner would want to know.  Or maybe he/she wouldn't.\n\nIt was my first time at HS, and I was unfamiliar with their flavors, though had heard lots about Secret Breakfast.  The prices were a bit on the high side, so I wanted to make sure I was happy with whatever I chose, and usually, ice cream parlours are more than happy to give you a small sample of their wares.  I asked for a sample of Secret Breakfast, and decided I liked it.  Since I was going to order a combo of three scoops, I asked to sample the Caramel Balsalmic; my third choice was going to be Tahitian Vanilla and I knew that would be something I'd enjoy.  The dour gal behind the counter, who had been standing in the same position with her arms crossed and scowl on her face since I entered the store, (no welcome or even acknowledgement that I'd entered) REFUSED to give me a second sample.  And my first sample was a mere pea-sized speck.  I asked why, and in a very passive/aggressive sing-song tone, she told me that if she gave out samples to customers all day long, that no one would get any service.  Um, OK.  I was the only customer in the shop.  While she was scooping out my bowl, her body language, frequent sighing, and slamming around of utensils let me know exactly what she thought of my presence in her store.\n\nAs a seasoned front-of-the-house employee who has worked at establishments from vegetarian burger stands on the beach to Michelin 2-stars, it's *never* OK to make lacking service the customer's fault.  It just isn't done.  And if she had a less jaded attitude, I may have had some sympathy, but from the moment I entered the shop, her contribution to the ambiance was waves of ennui, like \"my degree at a private East Coast university makes me way too good to be scooping out ice cream.\"  I just don't get why so many of a certain kind of restaurant--oh heck; I'll just use the H word and say *hipster*--insists upon hiring these types with obviously no customer service experience or desire to happily serve people.  Is it for the look?  \n\nAnyhoo, the Tahitian Vanilla was good but not great, and the Secret Breakfast and Caramel Balsalmic were not at all anything I'd ever order again.  I guess HS's ice cream just isn't my cup of tea, but their atrocious service is unforgiveable.

I've tried the stuff three times (once at Mission St Foods and twice at the store) and I've gone from hopeful to skeptical to naysaying. \n\nAs one yelper hinted, HS is all about shock value, not actual value. The flavors are exciting, but they don't deliver. I've had Vietnamese coffee, balsamic caramel, olive oil, salt and pepper, secret breakfast and others that I can't remember and have never felt the need to finish my cup (not that I didn't, of course--I just didn't NEED to). Some of the flavors taste pretty good at first, but they all become overpowering after a few bites. Something about them is out of balance. PLUS--and I can't get over this--there were ice chunks in several of the flavors. Really? For $3/scoop or whatever it is?!\n\nI'm sorry, I'm a Bi-Rite gal all the way. The only thing HS really beats Bi-Rite on (and the reason I give it 3 stars instead of 2) is the atmosphere of the store. HS is adorable and calm and has seating (indoor and outdoor). \n\nHopefully they'll mature a little by toning down the flavors and learning how to keep the ice out of the ice cream.", "author": "haley b."}

Simply put, this was a gem I didn't even know existed in my neighborhood until the buzz starting radiating like a siren in the last month.  And for that, I am almost ashamed.  Despite my love of Bi-Rite (annoyingly long lines), Bombay Creamery (the best the best), and Mitchells (sorbets are so good)...how could I have not known.  I am supposed to be the ice cream tour lady!\n\nAfter breaking ym Humphry Slocombe virginity at Mission Street Food with Vietnamese Coffee and Cinnamon Brittle, I returned in glory to taste again.\n\nOverall having ice cream is an experience.  Be sure that your palate is cleansed before trying a taste.  You taste something at first, something different in the middle, then something different at the end.\n\nMy boyfriend and I first got a double which comes with three scoops with Secret Breakfast, Strawberry Candied Jalapeno, and Chese 'N Rice.  The former is a mix of cornflakes and bourbon--which to my alcohol distaste--is better when combined with other flavors.  The Strawberry Candied Jalapeno is like Mexican spiced strawberries--the odd unexpected spice is startling, but then the strawberry flavor comes strong.  Oddly enough, the jalapeno flavor goes away after repeated tastings; perhaps due to adapation?  The rice adds a nice texture to Cheese 'N Rice, although I could barely taste the cheese as it was only like vanilla.\n\nOn my second visit, I got a single with Thai Chili Lime Sorbet and Coconut Sherbert.  It is true the latter flavor reminded me of the coconut ice cream I had on the streets of Bangkok--unfortunately minus the usual mixings like corn.  The former was...like the Strawberry Candied Jalapeno with a surprising kick with the chili and settling down into the lime.\n\nIt's hard not to pull down any ratings with the happy faces around me.  Everyone is always pleased with the experience.  Even the people behind the counter exude happiness as if they do truly love to work there.  People often came in and out greeting the employees, stepping behind the counter to say hello.  \n\nIf the light is off in the bathroom, the switch is broken and I believe you need to push.

I was thinking about giving Humphry Slocombe a second chance after checking it out two years ago and not liking it as much.  So we drove down to the Mission after 9pm.  The line wasn't too bad compared to Bi-Rite.  I couldn't figure out how to look up their daily menu on Twitter, so I had to go there blindly to see if there was anything I would like.  The menu was limited: Secret Breakfast, Blue Bottle Vientamese Coffee, Harvey Milk and Honey, Tahitian Vanilla, Salt and Pepper, Candied Ginger, McEvoy Olive Oil, Strawberry Szhechuan sorbet, and a salted watermelon sorbet. Hmm...I wasn't feeling too adventurous so I stuck with the Harvey Milk and Honey (with crumbled graham crackers).  My husband went with Gabba Gabba Hey sundae.  The Harvey Milk ice cream was ok....it tasted grainy because of the graham cracker and it was a bit hard...not as smooth compared to Bi-Rite ice cream.  It didn't melt as fast compared to the Secret Breakfast and Tahitian Vanilla we picked up a couple years ago...makes me wonder about their ice cream now.  I sampled the Gabba Gabba Hey and it was surprisingly tasty....you couldn't taste the caramel because it was overpowered the balsamic flavor.  \n\nThe service was ok....some of the staff look tired like they wanted the night to end.  It's a bit pricier as well.  Humphry Slocombe ice cream is more for the likes of Anthony Bourdain...perhaps a bit too gourmet for me where I have to analyze every bite of my ice cream.

You have to have an open mind coming here since they don't make your average joe ice cream like cookies and cream or mint chip. My bf finally convinced me to give it a shot and I'm happy that he did. The past 3 times I've gone, the Secret Breakfast has gotten better and better (meaning more bourbon!). Other flavors I've enjoyed are Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, Fudgesicle and Tahitian Vanilla. I tried the Jesus Juice, but no likey since I'm not a red wine fan to begin with. They sell flavors by the pint and also have cookies and ooh their bacon peanut brittle is frickin awesome.  \n\nParking in the neighborhood stinks, but I think it's worth the trip out here. Seating is very limited (about 8 stools inside and a few tables and chairs outside). They're pretty patient with customers asking to taste every single flavor and they also provide you with water which comes in handy after inhaling 3 scoops of ice cream. Their bathroom is pretty clean, too.  \n\nFollow them on Twitter for entertaining updates on their daily special flavors (@humphryslocombe).", "author": "Joy L."}

With the opening of so many new places, it is definitely hard to stand out among the rest, but Humphry Slocumbe is trying their best to do so. Exotic flavors such as Passion Milk Chocolate, McEvoy Olive Oil, Salt and Pepper, and Secret Breakfast scream out to the patron, \"TRY ME, TRY ME!\" The flavors stimulate my palette, but to be honest, sometimes they just aren't for me. Up until last week, I wasn't sure how I felt about this newcomer to the ice cream world, but that all changed last Thursday when I had one of the best desserts I've ever tasted.\n\nWhen I enter any ice cream shop, I do my fair share of sampling of the exotic and outlandish, because hey, you only live once. After sampling Hibiscus Beet Sorbet and Passion Milk Chocolate, my eyes were averted by another curious sounding menu item: Fois Gras on Gingersnap. There was no doubt in my mind that I was going to order it. The server even warned me that it was super fois-grasy and offered an additional sample, but I still went for it, and boy was it AMAZING! The ice cream hits you with the richness and heartiness that fois gras brings, but it finished sweet and creamy. It paired so well with the crisp and chewy housemade gingersnap that I wish I had bought two of them! It is a must try if it is available again on the menu.", "author": "Christina N."}

I had previously tasted their olive oil ice cream at the farmer's market, and it was better then I thought it would be. This time I stood in line and tried tastes of four different flavors: balsamic caramel, coconut sherbet, milk chocolate passionfruit, and a miso pear flavor. The balsamic caramel was good, but I don't like caramel so I couldn't imagine eating a scoop of strongly flavored caramel ice cream. The coconut was decent, but not mind blowing. The other two were too salty. I don't know that I've thought ice cream was salty before, but these definitely were. \n\nI guess I just prefer my traditional ice cream to these gourmet flavors. I think some flavors are done well, but I'm usually looking for flavors from my childhood when I want some ice cream. So what flavor did I end up getting? Nothing.

A really really lovely experience all around.\n\nI came for the salt & pepper ice cream, which was unfortunately out of rotation on that Sunday afternoon. I did however sample the balsamic caramel and Secret Breakfast (I was eyeballing the coffee one too, but I felt like a douchebag asking for yet another sample). The former was deliciously tangy and earthy, while the latter contained a little too much bourbon for my palette (the alcohol taste is NOT subtle, people... if you think it is, it might be time to put the bottle down). \n\nUltimately, I settled on the pistachio bacon and the olive oil flavors. My favorite was definitely the olive oil, with delicate hints of orange and a slightly viscous, velvety texture (while maintaining it's creamy integrity). Normally I detest pistachio ice cream, but Slocombe's version is in a class of it's own. It has great balance and is vaguely reminiscent of a salted spumoni.  My homegirl gobbled down the equally impressive Valrhona fudgesicle, highly recommended for our vegetarian amigos out there.\n\nThe ladies behind the counter were patient, knowledgeable, and accommodating with all our sampling requests. Indeed, they also suggested informed flavor pairings.\n\nFor those of you who think $3.50 is too much for 2 delicious scoops of gourmet ice cream, Rite Aid eagerly awaits your return.\n\nAs for the guy who referred to Slocombe as more \"vanilla\" than Bi-Rite -- Foooo, you MUST be trippin'.

The streets are lined with beautiful trees, taquerias and coffee shops.  An ice cream shop seems to be an excellent addition.  \n\nDespite its huge popularity, it was pretty empty when we arrived around dinner time on a Sunday night.

Both were delicious so I got them in a cup.  \n\nA single is quite generous, for a little over $3.  The Secret Breakfast wasn't something I'd expect myself to like, since I was never adventurous when it comes to ice cream flavors.  But it was really delicious!  It tastes a bit like a bowl of cereal and milk, but with more intense flavors, and by intense flavors, I mean, there's bourbon in it.  \n\nVietnamese coffee was delicious also.  Both were airy and really sweet.  My husband had the secret breakfast and nectarine/blueberry.

The bacon layers a quiet but strong undercurrent of flavor here (flavor only, not texture)... i can eat this all day long.\n\nthe balsamic caramel SOUNDS like it can possibly go wrong... however, upon tasting this, i had to get a full scoop. it's so COMPLEX... the SLIGHT tanginess of the balsamic, the rich, buttery taste of caramel, combined together so that with every single spoonful, the ice cream tastes different - it's a chameleon that surprises in depth with every bite.\n\nI didn't try the Secret Breakfast, or the Beet Sorbet, or some of the other flavors. but definitely will do so next time i'm in the neighbourhood.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nthis place is CASH ONLY. there's samples of the bacon peanut brittle for tasting (so good that i bought a pack to enjoy in private). it's a perfect getaway when you want to catch up with a friend and don't want to go to starbucks or yet another sit-down meal.\n \nThe service is friendly, and they are not grumpy about you trying all the flavors. the tasting spoon are real silverware (as supposed to plastic disponsible ones) - so you don't feel so bad having tried all the flavors.\n\nthis is one of my favorite ice cream places in SF, and definitely some place to take folks from out of town to amaze & impress.

Enjoyable, and the tastes all complemented each other.\n\nBut I was really bothered by the mouthfeel of the ice cream, since it left a really heavy, greasy film on my mouth.  Usually, this means it was overchurned and the fats start to agglomerate.  Very disappointing, since it degraded what should have been an excellent ice cream to a merely good one.\n\nI would have been tempted to write it off as a bad one-off, but my Vietnamese coffee ice cream was even greasier.\n\nSo while they get an A for inventiveness, they get a C- for the actual execution of making a good ice cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "3.5 stars, rounded down.\n\nI was telling my friend this weekend that I think ice cream (well, gourmet ice cream, to be exact) is making a huge comeback.  It's like the new \"it\" thing.  Remember when all those froyo places were sprouting up all over the city?  I feel that way about ice cream now.  \n\nSo, Anh-Thu N.  and I had just finished a slice of pizza at Arinell's for dinner, and we thought it'd be great to follow it up with some ice cream.  We walked all the way from 16th/Valencia to Harrison/24th because we didn't anticipate how far it would be.  So much walking = SUCKS FOR US!  But it's cool, because On2 is quite possibly the funniest and greatest person in the world, so it was worth it.\n\nAnyway, here's what I liked and didn't like about this particular adventure:\n\nDIG: \n+ I got Secret Breakfast (tastes like BOURBON = WIN!!) and Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee, and both were quite delicious.  Especially the Secret Breakfast, as you may have guessed.  It totally surprised me how awesome and alcoholy it tasted.  It was unlike anything I've ever tasted.  I also tried peanut butter curry as well as a couple other flavors, and they were all. . .unique, to say the least.\n+ They don't charge for a waffle cone, which is awesome!  But note: if you get a cone on top of your ice cream (like, in addition to putting it into a cup), they do charge. \n+ It's $3.25 for a \"single,\" but the single includes two scoops, so that, compared to other ice cream places, is a decent price - even though, if you think about it, paying that much for two scoops of ice cream is a luxury that many can't afford, so it's kinda problematic that we're all so accepting of this price, right?\n+ The people working here are very friendly.\n\nNOT DIG:\n- It's CASH ONLY.  If you hang out with me enough, you know that I HATE cash only places because I never carry around enough cash with me.  This time, I had to pay for my ice cream with 13 quarters because that's all I had on hand.  (Ask me later why I had 13 quarters on hand) The good thing, though, was that the sales person was super nice, so I'll give them that.  \n- Okay, so the flavors taste pretty good, but the consistency was not good to me and WAY too soft and creamy.  About 30 seconds after I got my ice cream cone, the ice cream started melting all over my hands.  I had to eat very hastily, which was not enjoyable, and I grabbed many napkins to wipe the sticky sweet drops that were dripping all over me.  Maybe this is a certain special type of ice cream, but it really shouldn't melt this fast.  It wasn't even a particularly hot day!\n- Too far from public transit!   Or maybe I'm just too lazy to walk.\n\nSo, overall, it tasted good, but consistency was terrible. I'm still also trying to get used to ice cream being this price.  If you get a tub of ice cream at the store, that entire tub is like $5 or so.  Compare that with this.\n\nI do think, though, that ice cream in general makes people very happy, so as long as it keeps doing that, it's a very good thing.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I'm more of a gelato fan but I love crazy flavors of ice cream that tastes great too.  Once I got there I had to sample the Salt and Pepper to see what the buzz was all about.  Well, I have to say it was quite interesting but no thank you.  It definately had strong pepper flavors, salty, and had the sweet ice cream flavor to it.  Maybe if I continue having a few more bites the flavor will grow on me but thought I'd pass on it this time.  Other flavors I tried were:\n\nHibiscus Beet: Yummy..sweet and tangy.  Definately could taste the beet and definately refreshing.\n\nSecret Breakfast: Love the bourbon in this! Nothing too exotic but great taste!  This one melts pretty easily too.\n\nRed Hot Banana: Wow! Never thought cinnamon with bananas would go together so well.  Actually bought a tub of this with the Secret Breakfast and both of these flavors complement each other very well!\n\nMaple Walnut: Hmm..nothing exciting but I love maple walnuts! =)\n\nToo bad I didn't get to try their Vietnamese blue bottle coffee since it was all gone by the time I got there.  =(  In the end I ordered a single scoop with the maple walnut and hibiscus beet and brought home the tub of ice cream to enjoy at home.  Also bought their bacon peanut brittle and it sure is good! Pretty pricey though considering one bag costs $6.  \n\nOnly thing I didn't like about this place was how easily the ice cream melts.

Secret Breakfast:\nFavorite. Refreshing, crunchy (corn flakes), and the rummy kick is really an exciting exit kick of flavor. \n\n3. Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip:\nNot a big fan of cream cheese, but the cream cheese flavor was slight. The bittersweet chocolate chips were delicious. Rich.\n\nCoconut Sherbet:\nPretty rich (seems like \"rich\" is the theme word this entry) for a sherbet! Coconut flavor is very full and true. \n\nMalted Dulce de Leche:\nVery creamy and flavor-packed. \n\nIt's premium ice cream asking premium prices.

Call me closed-minded, but the appeal of bacon or olive oil flavored ice cream is completely lost on me.  Who's with me?\n\nAnd the ice cream itself was not that good!  It tasted mealy and watery.  I could swear it tasted \"low fat\" without actually being low fat.  It was the first time in a long time that I didn't finish my ice cream.  Neither did my sister.\n\nI should have known I was in trouble when I drove right by this place.  The blue awning simply said \"ice cream\" on it, and the Humphry Slocombe name and logo was inconspicuously displayed on a tiny metal sign on the sidewalk.  I should have known I was in trouble when the first thing I saw were the Campbell's Soup painting a la Andy Warhol, except the flavors read \"fetal kitten\" and \"salt -n- pepper.\"   I should have known I was in trouble when the place was completely empty at 6:30 on a Wednesday night, although people did show up a few minutes later.\n\nWe ordered Fudge-something, Creme Fraiche and Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee flavors.  I got mine in a cup, and my sis - in a cone.  2 single servings, which included a total of 4 generous scoops, only cost us $6.50.  Cheap, to be sure.  Fudge-something flavor tasted kind of blah, not too chocolate-y and none too memorable.  Creme Fraiche tasted like tart frozen yogurt, but saltier.  I saw my sister grimace when she tried it.  The Vietnamese Coffee flavor was good, but it was hard to enjoy it on account of the ice cream being so bland and watery.\n\nI proclaim \"Humphry Slocombe\" to be \"Hungry No-Cone,\" as in I'd rather go without ice cream than eat theirs.  Mitchell's and Bi-Rite cost a little more, but they are, oh, so much better.  \n\nOf course, if you're in the market for ice cream that tastes like pork rinds, thousand island salad dressing, Buffalo Ranch Chicken Sandwich or turnip, check www.HumphrySlocombe.com for future updates.", "author": "Yan G."}

Unfortunately, in San Francisco, these are not that frequent, so even overcast days are ice cream days, which means, that even on those days, for a place like Humphry Slocombe, the lines are long.\n\nSo, usually I tend to get a hankering for ice cream when the weather is most inhospitable. like 8:30pm on a Wednesday night, when it is windy and foggy for most of the city.\n\nHumphry Slocombe is conveniently tucked away East of Mission on 24th Street and Harrison, where it's like a little beacon of light in an area that is relatively lacking in light. Even catching it right before closing time, the place was full, but the line was short. Perfect.\n\nThe ice cream is made on site (you can view the equipment through a window), the decor is clean, spare and quirky, with counters and stools to sit at to enjoy your creamy treasure and a two-headed calf to oversee the proceedings from above.\n\nThe place is a predictable hipster heaven of gourmet and unorthodox flavor combinations, which is the charm. I didn't try the coffee, since there's plenty of words spent on it. I tried instead plain old vanilla (well, actually, Tahitian), \"rosemary's baby\" (pine nut and rosemary), and peanut butter and curry.\n\nThe peanut butter and curry ice cream while intriguing, was a failed experiment. I decided to skip that one, and order as scoop each of the others. The vanilla was divine. Why have vanilla here? Well, I think there's something to be said about simplicity. The rosemary, however, was the surprise of the night. It was a symphony of flavor. By itself, it might be too much, and perhaps with only vanilla, it might have been too little. The two were a winning combo.\n\nHowever, don't come for any particular flavor. That would defeat the purpose. The reason for coming is spontaneity. It is about feeling like an ice cream, going there, and getting what strikes you. No plans, no preconceived notions about what you \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" get.

Bi-Rite? Ici? Okay, its name gets a 9 on quirkiness but a 3 on concept.  But moving on, what really makes Humphry stand out are their ridiculous flavors!  All of these gourmet ice cream places are known to have unique flavors but Humphry really would make ANYTHING into a flavor.\n\nNow I really dig the decor of the place.  With its blue awning and white floor, it really feels like an old ice cream parlor.  The walls are decorated with interesting Campbell soup can paintings of the Andy Warhol variety but with a twist.\n\nWhen we got there, Orange Chocolate and Vietnamese Coffee were out, which made this Viet boy quite sad.  Instead, I got the famous Secret Breakfast and Olive Oil.  The breakfast was cornflakes and the secret was bourbon!  And yep, this is the ice cream for alcoholics because you really do taste the bourbon.  I thought it was good but the alcoholic taste got tiring after a bit.  But Olive Oil was awesome! Fruity, light, lemony, and delicious!\n\nMy friend was even more adventurous when she went with Peanut Butter Curry and Tahitian Vanilla.  The vanilla was good, it had some kind of spice that gave it a kick and made it taste a bit exotic.  The curry on the other hand tasted...like curry, but in ice cream form.  Again, 8 on creativity but 3 on actual taste.  Humphry's servings are HUGE so you definitely get your money's worth but overall the ice cream texture was not as good as Bi-Rite or Ici.  It was a bit too icy and not creamy enough.\n\nSo props to Humphry for taking ice cream flavors where they never went before, but a minus because some things still aren't meant to be ice cream.  I would come back to see what other creations them have come up with but would probably limit myself to just samples of the more interesting flavors.", "author": "Alex T."}

I love nearly everything about this place.  \n\nThe 'secret breakfast' flavor combines about seven of my favorite things in life- cereal, sugar, bourbon, dessert, breakfast, combining weird dishes, cold, and clever names- it's kind of like everything great about being a kid AND an adult.\n\nIt's like getting a snow day and I don't have to go to school so I sleep in 'till like 10:30.  When I get up, mom already has my Wheaties ready with the sugar bowl too 'cause what kid likes plain Wheaties? and then I decide to have a side of ice cream for breakfast 'cause I'm actually an adult and I can do what I want and then REMEMBERING I'm an adult I pull out my old friend Maker's and start taking a few nips early 'cause, hey, it's cold out and I don't have to do ANYTHING except maybe go sledding and enjoy my delicious, flavorful, creamy, icy, joy of a dessert from my old friend Humphrey.  God Bless this joint.  Try everything, even though you might be embarrassed like me, because they're patient and they'll let you and you're using metal tasting spoons(!) so you don't have to worry about filling up the great pacific gyre with your gluttony.  \n\nAlso, this is a quieter, lovely corner of the Mission to sit outside and compare surprising flavors with whichever new friends you happen to make because such novel experiences lend themselves to efficiently crossing the normal social barriers.  Wine and coke? don't mind if I do! Balsamic vinegar? hell yes. Do it people, go here and enjoy immensely.

I liked the Valrhona fudgesicle flavor the best, and the malted dulce de leche was good as well, although it could've been more strongly flavored. The balsamic salted caramel was good, though, if a bit odd, a bit too sweet (designed to be that way, I'm sure). Maple walnut was standard. I'd like to try the secret breakfast and Blue Bottle coffee flavors.\n\nThe brownies and cookies looked good, although we didn't try any. Decor is minimal, not necessarily a bad thing.

When you've scanned the list of hand-scrawled flavors, you know that Humphry cannot simply be an ice cream maker, but a mad scientist above all, concocting truly bizarre ice cream combinations such salt and pepper and curry peanut butter. Although you still cannot place it, the smell begins to make sense: ice cream and waffle cones mixed with coffee and curry and olive oil and bourbon and fois gras! Yes, Humphry's is the Dr. Seuss of ice cream.\n\nAs for the flavors, the Secret Breakfast -- corn flakes with a good, strong kick of bourbon -- is divine. It is both unique and comforting, frankly the way ice cream should be.\n\nThe only thing I hate about Humphry's has nothing to do with the ice cream. The name (which apparently originates from a low-brow British sitcom) is both unmemorable and hard to spell. Thankfully the memorable ice cream makes up for the unmemorable name.", "author": "Dan V."}

Tasty and they complimented each other well, but they couldn't touch a similar combination that Bi-Rite offers, Balsamic Strawberry and Salted Caramel.  My girlfriend's ice cream was the hit of the evening: Blue Bottle Coffee (yum) and Pine Nut Rosemary (also yum).  Again I couldn't help comparing the Pine Nut Rosemary to the Honey Lavender offered by Bi-Rite, which is a stronger combination.  A friend of mine ordered the Jesus Juice (coca-cola red wine sorbet) and Miso Peach.  He was less lucky.  While I enjoyed the novelty of a couple of bites of each of these flavors, I wouldn't have wanted to be stuck with a whole cup.

There's no bourbon flavor anymore, it almost taste just like pure vanilla ice cream, and the flavor is off from what it used to be. We just tried their burnt butter flavor, which is one of my husband's favorite, it used to be so rich and flavorful, but this last time it was also super mild in flavor that it almost tasted like pure vanilla flavor.  Their scoops used to be cheaper and bigger, they are now more expensive and smaller... is it just me or are they starting to cut corners? I might give them another try, 3rd time since the first dissapointment, but that might be it if the flavors are not there anymore. =(", "author": "Crystal M."}

The staff is not that friendly but the ice cream flavors are unique! I tried the Salt & Pepper, it was different but I didn't get that one. I eventually ended up with the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee with Tahitian Vanilla on a cone. My friend had the Tahitian Vanilla with Coke float. Their floats are very interesting, they pour the coke from a small glass bottle and give you the rest of the bottle. Very cute!\nTheir seating is awesome, at most ten stools along the window.  But I can see how it can get filled really easily. Parking wasn't too bad, a lot of street parking, it's in the Mission area. \nFour stars because it's a really cute place, definitely a charm in the city. But I'm more of the sweet strawberry ice cream kind of girl and there was  nothing fruity and sweet on the menu this time around. I went on their website to see what other flavors they had and they actually have a large list that they rotate around. So I will definitely come back to try more of their flavors!", "author": "Miffy Y."}

The collaboration with Boccolone to create a prosciutto ice cream is ingenious.  Every day at humphry's there are new flavors to try, the only constant is the secret breakfast.  For me this was a must, it is bourbon ice cream with pieces of a cornflake cookie running throughout it.  It was delicious, the bourbon wasnt so strong, you tasted it more on the back end. The cornflake was good, it stayed crisp, while some add ins generally become soggy.  Another collaboration was with a local favourite, Blue Bottle Coffee.  Sometimes coffee flavoured ice cream taste artificial, but this was probably th best coffee ice cream i have had.  That paired with the secret breakfast was perfect.  As good as the flavours were, they lose points for the texture, it tasted slightly melted, and didnt hold its shape.  My sis had the Harvey Milk, along with the Jesus Juice.  She loved the creaminess of the Harvey Milk, but the Jesus Juice should not have been served.  It was along the bottom of the pail, and right after hers was scooped, the bucket was pitched.

Usually, I stay away from chocolate ice cream (except rocky road), but was pretty impressed by the richness (and not too sweet) of the dark fudge.  I was told that the balsamic caramel was a good pairing with the fudge, but I found the caramel waaaaay too sweet for me.  The Vietnamese coffee flavor was perfect, semisweet and bitter with the ahh so yummy coffee taste.  \n\nOther flavors I tried from my friends scoops:\nOlive Oil - to my surprise it wasn't that bad..Still not my favorite.\nGingerbread Guinness - Pretty good.  I didn't taste much Guinness, but maybe it was suppose to be a faint flavor of Guinness? \nHoney Thyme - Pretty good, but a bit sweet after a while.\nSecret Breakfast - Pretty damn good, i have to get it next time!\n\nAll this place needs is balsamic strawberry that's more yummy than bi-rite's and it would absolutely be better!", "author": "Dee S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-10", "description": "I really didn't know of this place until I saw the line around the block on the day of the Food Festival back in August. A line that long around the block is a sure sign of something that must be good...so that was when I've got this placed bookmarked and I'm glad I had finally tried it. Similar to Bi-Rite's, they had their little creations of flavors. They all seem so interesting that it was sucha tough choice to pick just one. Which means that this is another one of those places that's require me to go back many times to get a decent load of their selections. Anyhow, we went on a Friday night around 8pm thinking that parking will be a pain but it wasn't bad at all. We were able to park a block awhile within just five minutes of looking. We got there, stared at the many unique flavors in confusion for a bit...tried a couple and I settled with \"Elvis: The Fat Years\". I think it was more of the name that attracted me to the flavor than anything...I found it really cute...heehee. The flavors of Elvis consisted of bananas, bacon, and peanut brittle. It was a pretty cool combo with bacon. I am typically not a bacon fan but ever since I had tried Dynamo's crunchy bacon-bits on a donut, I have been sold to try bacon with other types of sweets. In this case, my ice-cream. I was expecting the ice-cream to be more of a banana tasted to it, but instead it was more like peanut butter ice cream...I think the peanut brittle really overpowered the taste of the bananas. There were chunks and bits of peanut brittle in the ice -cream, so that was yummy. However, not much bacon...only a few pieces here and there...I was barely able to taste it. It was almost as if it didn't made a difference if it was in the ice-cream or not. It's not bad though overall, but just didn't deliver the same amount of excitement as it did when I saw it's name. My friend that was with me was a bit daring...he didn't sample any of the ice-cream flavors. Instead, he asked the server what was their most popular flavor and just took that. He ended up with \"Secret Breakfast\", which was made with bourbon and cornflakes. Interesting. Not knowing what was in his ice-cream at the time, I took a spoonful and tried it. My first impression was like ewww...why the hell does this taste like really strong alcohol?? I was expected something sweet, so this took me by surprise a bit. I am really sensitive to the taste of dark liquor so immediately I knew there was something unusual to it. When I was told it was bourbon, in my head, i was like...of course it had to be whiskey...nasty. I didn't try any of the cornflakes in it...I didn't want to. That bourbon flavor in the ice-cream was so intense...like BAM! I did have a second spoonful of it a little while later to be fair and I still didn't like it. I guess I really prefer my alkie and sweets separate. I can see how other ppl that does like it though...it's very tasteful indeed. There will definitely be next time...perhaps for their Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee...", "author": "Winnie L."}

Secret breakfast is an ambitious bourbon and corn flakes flavor; it tastes like a bartender at Phone Booth poured a few shots of Maker's Mark in the mix. The corn flakes are an appropriate crunchy addition. \n\nThe Thai chili lime sorbet and caramel balsamic are worth a try. I don't think that the olive oil flavor is quite there yet as the consistency was off and it didn't feel cold enough.\n\nThe great flavors, friendly demeanor of the staff and location leads me to believe that Humphry Slocombe will become a neighborhood institution.

It's as though they are embarrassed in their own selection of flavors and so they cover everything up with sugar coating. For example, the Balsamic Caramel tasted like sugar cotton wool. You would think it would taste of Caramel and Balsamic vinegar, right? Then no.\nB. the people working there weren't nice, and trust me, I was acting like a person who is about to have ice-cream.

Humphry Slocombe fulfills that interesting taste you have been craving for with flavors that fancy you and flavors that might even disgust but trust me give it a try and you won't regret it. I found this place when getting lost on the scenic drive in san fran, just as a friend had text me about this place i passed right by it and was like lets give this a try. I was eager to try Vietnamese Coffee, being from SoCal near little saigon i just had to compare. What I tried was purely remarkable in terms of how the ice cream was done. Ice cream comes in quite soft not super soft but firm enough to lick with ease and having tried pepper and sesame and a couple of their flavors that sounded disgusting i was amazed, that they could taste so well done and flavorful.

But, I can honestly say, I keep coming here over Bi-Rite and Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous b/c Humphry Slocombe keeps knocking it out of the park time and time again. They keep bringing in new flavors, new ideas, and new textures. I have seen the same flavors at Bi-Rite over the years with little fluctuation in their variety ( I must admit I love Bi-Rite too, so Bi-Rite, step it up).  The hours at Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous make them very inconvenient, but they have some very creative flavors too. I love that Humphry has many sorbets- chili lime sorbet and chocolate fudge sorbet- both AH-MAZ-ING and diary free- I don't know how they do it.  Today I went in and they had a pale ale with orange sherbert- wow- it was like I was enjoying a beer with an orange slice on it.

But as a loyal customer and huge Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream fanatic I believe I owe it to this little shoppe to give it the review it deserves. Humphry's has replaced Mitchell's and BiRite as my favorite ice cream place in all of San Francisco. Although they only have about 12 flavors a day, they rotate their flavors daily, and you are bound to find a surprisingly, extremely unique, yet oh so delicious flavor no matter what day you decide to drop by. The Olive Oil ice cream was simply lifechanging. I love Mediterranean food, but who thought the delightly smooth savory flavor of Olive Oil could be transformed into a deliciously sweet ice cream? This ice cream took on the most beautiful shade of yellowish cream, and it contained slivers of lemon and orange zest, the ultimate finish for this flavor. On the following day, I knew I had to return and see what was awaiting me. Cinnamon Brittle, once again, perfect. Just the right amount of kick from the cinnamon, crunchiness from the brittle, and creamy sweetness. The best part of this ice cream is that after you eat it, you do not feel like you need to spend hours and hours in the gym working it off (exercise? who does that?). It makes me feel young and hip, and like I can eat 1928012983 more. Perhaps it is just my stomach speaking.\nFor those who are into savory flavors, this is THE place to be. There is an extensive list of flavors on the website, among them salt and pepper, jalapeno strawberry, etc... Whatever floats your boat, Humphry's will have it.

We finally settled on Peanut Butter Curry and Balsamic Caramel, which were both crazy awesome.  Next time, we're going to get the Salt and Pepper flavor, because it just blew our minds and palattes.  We have also previously tried Secret Breakfast and some kind of stout/beer flavor from our cool friend Gary, who is 'in the know,' and those flavors were also....you guessed it, CRAZY AWESOME!", "author": "Beth K."}

He had the Secret Breakfast and it was pure Awesomeness!! I had the Olive Oil and Balsamic combo and that was really good. Although the Balsamic was a little too rich for me, I have to say, it was everything I had hoped. I liked the store front too. It was unpretentious and small.  I thought it would be expensive, but it was really only a couple of bucks more than buying a regular ice cream.  Yeah...check it out!!!

I immediately knew I wanted to try the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee Ice Cream.  So on one of the few hot days in SF, I came down here with my wife on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  Inside, we found a small ice cream store with no A/C and boiling.  Each week, there are 12 flavors that constantly rotate - although I'm sure the favorites stay.  \n\nI had the blue bottle and secret breakfast (bourbon and corn flakes).  Two amazing flavors.  This has to be one of the best ice cream places in the city.  You also have to love their portions.  A regular cone contains two large scoops.  I was very happy with the serving size.  My wife had the coffee and the balsamic caramel.  We do not recommend the balsamic caramel.  It's too salty and the not what we expected.  \n\nI'd be happy with two scoops of coffee ice cream.  i'll come back for this.", "author": "Scott L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-08-30", "description": "It appears that the boutique ice cream shop craze is here to stay in San Francisco and Humphry Slocombe is another entry in that genre. I want to love each new place, but I didn't LOVE this one. It was good, but not great. \n\nFirst, the positives. The shop is located in that newly hip area of 24th Street east of Mission and west of Potrero (on Harrison Street). Even on a warm day, the line was manageable, which is more than can be said of Bi-Rite on a cold day. The flavor names are clever, and I tried two. Special Breakfast (bourbon and cornflakes) and balsamic caramel.  Special breakfast was tasty, but not outstanding. \n\nNow, the not so positive: I was not a fan of balsamic caramel. Too much vinegar flavor, not enough caramel. If you are looking for caramel flavor ice cream, Bi-Rite's salted caramel is the flavor to beat, and this wasn't even close. And, granted, it was a warm San Francisco Saturday, so their freezers were probably working over time, but the ice cream was too soft for my taste -- it was dripping before I even got out the door. \n\nThere were other flavors that seemed worth a try, so I'll probably return. It's ice cream after all, so it's never really BAD and it's not expensive. There's not the investment factor of returning to a 3 Yelp star restaurant for a dinner, only to be disappointed again. \n\nI still love Bi-Rite and Mitchell's, so anything new is really going to have to be special.", "author": "Robert M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-03-10", "description": "After hearing Humphry Slocombe clumped together with the other ice cream giants in SF, I decided I had to come try it out. Unfortunately, I missed it a number of times because I eat dinner relatively late and the place closes at 9pm. Boo.\nBut last Saturday after an early dinner, we high-tailed it over here... and they were out of Secret Breakfast... noooo. I was super disappointed since that was basically what we came to get. Regardless, I ended up with a single of Vietnamese coffee and balsamic caramel, and the boy got tahitian vanilla (they also wrote out phonetically how to pronounce tahitian on the window.. I thought it was hilarious) and brown sugar. We also sampled the prosciutto ice cream, which was straight-up DISGUSTING. Not to mention, getting balsamic caramel was a mistake. It was interesting and good when I sampled it, but since I got a scoop, it was nastyyyy; it's way too much after one bite, mostly because you get the strong balsamic taste and then the sweetness of the caramel (which doesn't really balance out correctly). I love ice cream, but I've never been disappointed with a flavor like this one. Yes, the other three flavors were fine, but I was just grossed out by trying to dig around that scoop.\nNot to mention, the girl behind the counter was kind of unpleasant to deal with. An example would be when we asked her about one of the flavors, and she answered INTO the freezer, and then was short in tone with us when we asked her to repeat it.  I've never had such a mean person serve ice cream ): \nOverall, 3.5 stars (closer to 3) for the interesting flavors, but I think they do try too hard with some of them (there's a thin line between interesting and nasty). I might be back to try Secret Breakfast, but I'm not super gungho about it. I'm sticking to Bi-rite for now.", "author": "Jen T."}

The ice cream was affordable in bulk. We were able to purchase our favorite flavors (e.g. the famous Secret Breakfast, Vietnamese coffee, Tahitian vanilla), and our guests loved it. The ice cream stays frozen for 4 hours without freezing/refrigeration, and that was also very convenient. Only negative, which was quite inconvenient during the planning process, was that the representative whom I was communicating with was quite unresponsive. (I did wait for up to ~3 months to get a response via email with them.) Rest assure that they will get back to you and come through. I recommend working directly with Candy who can take care of your needs asap. Would have also been much more convenient if they offered delivery.

The staff was generous and patient and allowed everyone to \"try as much as you like.\" They were out of the milk chocolate passion fruit which sounded good so I tried the new kumquat and poppy seed (I love kumquats!). I also tried the McEvoy olive oil which was good as well but I decided to stick with the kumquat and poppy seed with blue bottle vietnamese coffee. I ended up waiting a bit as they were letting everyone sample and took the order of the couples in front of and behind me first. Jake Godby the owner (who has ice cream tattooed on his forearm) also just popped open a bottle of champagne to celebrate their 3-month anniversary - congratulations! - and they gave me a free topping on the house in celebration. I ended up getting a free third scoop - secret garden (bourbon and cornflakes!) - instead of a topping which was an awesome pairing with the Vietnamese coffee. Their ice cream has a nice balance of milk and cream making it deliciously creamy and dense. I'll definitely be back for the milk chocolate passionfruit and I'm curious about the other unique flavors: salt and pepper, government cheese, and balsamic caramel. I'll pass on the foie-gras gingersnap ice cream sandwich though! I'm excited to see what Jake comes up with next. Humphry Slocombe is my new favorite ice cream shop - better than Bi-Rite.

I went with my bestie after we ate at Chez Maman, and it wasn't hard to find parking. Before making our orders, we tried a couple of flavors like Jesus Juice (coke and red wine sorbet), Secret Breakfast (bourbon flavored ice cream with corn flakes) and candied ginger. Jesus Juice definitely had a kick to it, but was really refreshing. Secret Breakfast was super strong and a little bit too much for our palates. Candied ginger was really good, creamy with a hint of ginger candy, so good that I bought a pint home for my momma. \nWe both ordered the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee ice cream, which extremely strong and flavorful. It tasted like we were drinking super strong Vietnamese coffee. My bestie felt like it was too sweet, but I liked it just fine because I love the condensed milk in the Viet Coffee.\nNext time, I plan to try more flavors because I usually stick with the Blue Bottle.

The creme fraiche gave it a little off taste, not like normal milk ice cream flavor, so that was differently good.

All the flavors except Coffee sounded out of this weird. It was like some alien abducted some cows and a mad chef with a degree in chemistry and made some ice cream. How the hell did they come up with these flavors???\n\nSecret Breakfast - bourbon and cornflakes - When I first saw it I was totally like WTF? I tasted the bourbon and I tasted cereal, my mind was blown away. The first thing that came to my mind was probably \"Man, I wonder if underage kids come here all the time.\"\nJesus Juice - red wine and coke - It's more like a sorbet but still smooth and not icy at all. You can really taste the wine but I didn't taste the coke. Maybe the coke just made the wine less overwhelming. \nPeanut Butter & Curry - Awesomeee. You taste pb and then after you think that was it, you taste the curry. I normally don't like pb that much, I loved this. It wasn't overwhelming at all.\nBalsamic Caramel - I asked the guy behind the counter what his favorite was and he said this, so I gave it a try. Whabam! Balsamic is strong! After your taste buds are overwhelmed by the balsamic, you taste the caramel. I ended up getting a scoop of this but regretted it after 3 bites. It was only good in small doses.\nCandied Ginger - Sweet and simple. No crazy dances on your tongue but creamy and smooth.\nVietnamese Blue Bottle - I don't know how you can go wrong with coffee ice cream. It's a safe bet.\n\nI really like the interior. It's super cute but a lot of people like enjoying the weather and eating outside. I have to say I'm still a Bi-Rite fan through and through.

As weird as the flavor combinations are, they still work on some level. I tried several flavors before settling on the safe bet of Blue Bottle Vietnamese coffee. The olive oil was better than I thought and had a buttery taste at the end. Even the bacon and pistachio wasn't that bad. I liked how I could only taste the bacon flavor initially and the pistachio flavor at the end. The balsamic caramel was a little too extreme in terms of bite and acidity. I also actually thought the secret breakfast was way too sweet. I liked the oolong; it reminded me of green tea ice cream, but not. My favorite was the Vietnamese coffee. Why do they call it Blue Bottle? Anyways, it tastes exactly like Vietnamese drip coffee but in ice cream form. Regardless of how weird some of the flavors are, they are all spot on in terms of being what their name suggests.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

And I like the compostable cups.  The portions are solid and you can get two flavors in a small, which certainly broadens the experience.  \n\nBut with the flavors, they lose me.  Sometimes it feels like someone is hanging out in the kitchen throwing darts at a flavor chart.  I love ice cream, but I go there and it is hard for me to pick two flavors to get in my small.  Believe me, I do not shy away from strong, novel, or unusual flavors, but with ice cream I suppose I draw the line.   \n\nLast time I went a week or so ago, I got chocolate passionfruit and vanilla.  The former was interesting, but chocolate and fruit is a tricky thing.  They did it well, but the upside was just not so great.  The vanilla was really good, that  I will say.\n\nThe true test of the place is to what extent you go back there first before going somewhere else.

No, I am way more likely to go to Mitchell's or head down to Westlake for some frozen yogurt in Daly City.", "author": "Mokje K."}

Once we arrived, (BTW- parking Karma was in full effect and we found a spot right in front) and looked at all the flavors (I think around 8-ish) the server asked what I would like. Unlike my original plan, I froze and then blurted out \"Secret Breakfast! please\" . So much for be different, but it's the thought that counts. Anyway, we all ended up with the secret breakfast and we all ended up loving it. I do agree with some of the other yelpers- It is very bourbon-y but I like bourbon so that wasn't really an issue. If you don't like bourbon I suggest you try a sample before ordering a scoop. I also would have liked more cornflakes in the mix. I enjoyed their somewhat chewy/sweet texture. As for the ice cream itself, I found it to be creamy (one yelper used the term light and airy which I thing is a great description) and sweet.

I don't understand cash only places, especially in a sketchy neighborhood, like seriously, getting robbed is imminent there, since everyone knows that it's a cash only business, they also close late, like around 9p. \nOverall the experience deserved 3 stars due to the area, type of payment and heavy bourbon flavor on the secret breakfast ice cream, I think I would have to try Bi-Rite Creamery or stick with frozen yogurt.", "author": "Juicy C."}

It was cool to try out all the different flavors but I think I'm just a simple ice cream girl. I ended up getting the pumpkin and vanilla (see how adventurous I am?) while my friends made up all kinds of combinations. A friend who doesn't even like ice cream thought this was the best ice cream he's had.  I do agree with other reviewers that the texture of the ice cream is really good though so it's worth a try. So for me, I'd go again if a bunch of friends wanted to go check it out, but I'd probably stick with simple concoctions and then taste theirs :)", "author": "Mochi L."}

Sadly, I've come to the conclusion that it's overrated, the ice cream's not really that great, and the owner is kind of a douche. I haven't really found the employees to be too friendly either, but I haven't met all of them so that might not be fair.\n\nAlso, I was pretty annoyed the other night when people who had been waiting for 25 minutes for ice cream were turned away once this place closed. I've worked at a couple restaurants for several years, and there are really only two solutions to dealing with people who stick around during closing time.  You can either continue sitting people until closing time and then serve them, or stop taking names for the wait list if you don't think people will be able to eat and order before the kitchen closes. \n\nFor an ice cream shop, one could either cut off the line at closing time and serve everyone waiting (a la Ike's place) or cut off the line early to ensure everyone who is waiting will get ice cream before closing time. \nThis place did neither, resulting in dozens of poor souls walking home ice cream-less, despite waiting in line for 25 minutes.  Kind of douche baggy in my opinion...\n\nYes, the ice cream is pretty unique, so it's worth checking out if you've never been. But for a regular ice cream place with better ice cream and friendlier service,  I'd go somewhere else.", "author": "Alec W."}

Secret Breakfast is my favorite, and has certainly made it on my top 10 list of all time best ice creams I've had. I combined it with their Valhrona Fudgesicle, and the pairing was delightful.

So good that they'll haunt your dreams and force you to concoct evil plans to move to San Francisco where the ice cream is fresher, creamier, and more original than the ice cream in your own po-dunk town.  Okay, okay...Denver does have good ice cream, they've just been on vacation for the month of January.  So...back to Humphry.  You can sample each of the flavors - like the lively and intense balsamic vinegar or the naughtily nice butter beer.  But for me, it is all about sweet and salty.  The extra virgin olive oil is wildly delicious.  It tastes like...um...olive oil!  Really good olive oil with loads of fat and sugar.  It also comes with the ever so slight hint on lemon that gives it a nice touch.  On the other hand the chocolate smoked sea salt is so OMG good.  I'm about to freak out over its rich, creamy, sweet and salty deliciousness.  Since I can only get to SF a couple times a year, I have dedicated myself to cracking its code of yumminess.

Coffee ***** (terrific flavor) \nOlive Oil **** surprisingly good \nHibiscus Beet **** (my first sorbet there, and very good) \nBalsamic Caramel *** (grows on you, tastes a bit too burned imo) \nSalt & Pepper *** (surprising, but I can't imagine more than a few bites) \n\nIt's a unique place with unique flavors, so the price is bound to be higher than other places. I'm glad they are here, and I hope they do well.\n\nUPDATE July 2015.\n\nI'm so sorry to say, but my recent experience was so bad that I had to return to Yelp to change my initial review of 4 stars down to 2.\n I had two unacceptable issues with my order, a scoop of Fluffernutter and a scoop of Root Beer.\n1. Fluffernutter; completely melted ice cream. It was soup, grainy soup. They should never serve ice cream in this condition. It was terrible.\n\n2. Root Beer; full of ice crystals. Ice crystals in ice cream mean the product has been left out to melt considerably and then re-frozen and served again later. For premium ice cream this should never ever happen. It's Ice Cream 101 and it was really disappointing.\n\nI'm willing to stand in the long lines, I'm willing to deal with most of the menu being sold out, these are just how it goes.

There was a line straight out the door. I thought it was just slow service but ends up they are so nice to let everyone feel totally comfortable in asking for samples and explaining the ingredients. I know I tried everything I was curious about in the case :D\n\nThe creme fraiche was tart and tasted like a cross between sour cream and the plain yogurt at Pinkberry. Good but not what I was in the mood for. The coconut sherbet had the perfect amount of coconut flavor but since it was a sherbet it was very light. The secret breakfast was perfect for my dad since it was a vanilla ice cream flavored with bourbon with crunchy cereal bits but it was a bit strong for me. The blue bottle vietnamese coffee ice cream was awesome creamy and so intensely coffee flavored it was like 3 cups of cafe sua da  condensed into a scoop of ice cream. I ended up with the McEvoy olive oil, so creamy with bits of citrus zest, it was refreshing and creamy and paired perfectly with my new favorite ice cream ever, RED HOT BANANA. Banana ice cream with pieces of red hots blended in. It was sweet and creamy from the bananas with crunchy cinnamon bits that accentuated the banana flavor. I never thought about half the crazy combinations of flavors they have here, peanut butter and curry? So crazy. Can't wait to try it :D", "author": "Samantha T."}

Normally the high-end ice cream places make super bitter dark chocolate fudge sauces that IMHO, ruin the sweet, sugary creaminess of the ice cream.

Also, they do close at 9 pm so beware of that !.. I 've never really had to wait in a very long line like at Bi-Rite and Mitchells so that is a major PLUS.   My favorite is of course.. the Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee.. the coffee flavor is strong and bitter the ice cream is not too sweet which is good.  They also have some really \"unique\" and difference flavors.  Their most popular is the Secret Breakfast.. what's secret about it is the strong bourbon taste with crunch sweetness of cornflakes!  What a surprise taste it was!   The Boccalone Proschutio was a bit WIERD in my opinion.. however if you're a bacon ice cream or bacon toffee lover .. that is you love the flavors of sweet maple or sweet toffee and salty/smoky meat flavor together.. you'll really like this ice cream flavor.. not my kinda thing.  Peanut Butter lover?... make sure you get the flutter nutter.. tastes like a liquid nutter butter !  Another unique yet delicious flavor is the Honey Thyme... I always thought Honey ice cream was so refreshing (try the Haggen Daaz Honey Bee ice cream).. but with the Thyme, it really took this ice cream to another dimension! Was very much a summer treat.  Most people come here for their really one of a kinda flavors but if you love your plain ice cream flavors, there's something for everyone.  Try the Meyer LEmon sorbet, Tahitian vanilla or Chocolate.. you won't be disappointed!  The great thing about this place is the rotating flavors so everytime you go there, you always find something new to try with so many flavors I still look forward to trying..

I think that is the key to the consistency of flavors here - balanced. Humphry Slocombe has found a way to get under my skin.

It was around 9pm and the place was packed, line out the door.  A chilly SF evening wasn't enough to deter people from ice cream, I guess. So we got in line and looked at all the options on the wall.  They had some pretty unique concoctions, like the secret breakfast (bourbon & corn flakes) and strawberry margarita. For some reason, I just wasn't feeling the flavors.  Maybe I'm just a simple ice cream eater and prefer flavors like vanilla or chocolate.  So, after looking long and hard and sampling a few things, I settled on the malted chocolate.  My hubby got the secret breakfast, which he really enjoyed.  I tried it but couldn't really taste the bourbon.  It was also a bit too sweet for me.  My BFF got the tin roof sundae, which was surprisingly good.  She got one scoop of the tahitian vanilla and one scoop of the black sesame, topped with fudge and crunchy nuts.  The ice cream flavors were good (because I like classic flavors), but the nuts were awesome.  They were crunchy with a hint of saltiness, so perfect with the sundae.  I would come back again to give their other flavors another try.", "author": "Kat M."}

My first experience last week was phenomenal so I couldn't wait to go back again, this time with my fiancee and 2 sons and I had been talking it up all week to all my clients. Then i got my scoop, and it fell on the floor as to no fault of my own...  just was a small mishap. When i asked the man behind the counter for a second scoop, he got very rude, was sarcastic, and gave me a scoop about half the size of the previous scoop. My fiancee was so shocked by this mans attitude toward me, he no longer wanted the ice cream we had  looked forward to all day. Because of the customer service, I will not only never go back, but I will never recommend it to any more of my clients. It's too bad, all the other workers seemed happy and kind. Not the tall guy with the shaved head! He must have just had a bad day. But please don't take it out on me.

That said, it was really tasty, which is why I ordered a scoop (perhaps they were inspired by the sundae at Bi-Rite that includes sea salt and Bergamot Olive Oil? I'm not saying, I'm just saying...).  The Guinness Ginger Cookie was really tasty, and I am also a big fan of the Balsamic Caramel -- the balsamic vinegar cuts the cloying sweetness of the caramel, which usually turns me off in other caramel-based ice-cream flavors. I think they will eventually give Bi-Rite a run for the money (though they cost about the same) once they iron out some of their consistency issues (i.e., as in the literal consistency of the ice cream, not the quality). I also tried the Cream Cheese Chip, which was okay, but didn't seem interesting enough to merit adding cream cheese, or highlighting it in the name. \nDefinitely nice that it's not so crowded this time of year, so they're happy to let you sample 'as many or as few flavors as you would like'. (That's what the very friendly server told me. So sample to your heart's content! (Oh, and their sample spoons are very cool, if a bit awkward to transfer from one person to another. They're tiny!)\nAnd I almost forgot -- the Secret Breakfast is really tasty, too!\nI'll def be back for more. Looking forward to the launch of the sundaes. (Sounds like a movie, no?

The special breakfast is amazing...delicious but not too sweet vanilla with corn flakes soaked in bourbon?  Yeah, sign me up.  And the brown butter had little bits of actual creamy butter in it.  Wow.  What a combination.  The coffee ice cream was great as well...actually tasted like coffee, but not too strong.  Price is fair, 4 bucks for two scoops of ice cream this good is fine with me.

I LOVE IT! \n\nNot to be too repetitive (which it will be) - Vietnamese Blue Bottle Coffee Ice Cream + Secret Cereal + Guiness Gingerbread are the favorites - Cream Cheese Chip was good as well. How does this compare to Bi-Rite? Tough call - I honestly like the texture of Bi-Rite better (and I still love Orange Cardamom), but I like the unique-ness of the flavors better at Humphrey Slocombe. I went daring & even tried the Thai Chili Lime Sorbet - and as unique as it is, it's really not that tasty - unless you want spicy icecream/sorbet. However, isn't the reason you go to get ice cream is to cool down or calm the spices from the Mexican food you just had in the Mission a couple streets down? So going the spicy route wasn't my thing - maybe if they tried Mexican Hot Chocolate (not the Bi-Rite Mexican Chocolate which I do not like).\n\nAnyways, overall a great place - I love this 24th Street Corridor - Yats', Dynamo Doughnuts, Humphrey Slocombe, and more to come. :)", "author": "Jeannette L."}

I tried about 5 flavors, and as soon as someone came in behind me, I placed our order.\n\nWent back on Sunday about 6pm and they were out of ice cream.  They had a few pints left, but nothing to scoop.  \n\nSo they get 4 stars instead of 5 because they ran out of ice cream (all of it), and because when I went the first time, they only had one \"traditional\" flavor (vanilla bean).

The weather is beautiful and it is the perfect time to stop in and have some delicious ice cream at Humphry's!

The flavors are all really original (secret breakfast: bourbon and corn flakes-hangover joke, thai chili lime: refreshing and spicy, etc.) and the website (http://www.humphryslocombe.com)says they will carry even more amazing flavors such as blood orange sorbet, sweet corn blackberry, honey thyme, and pistachio-BACON!! \nNot only that, but the boys who run it are quite cute and charming. Sean with sparkling eyes, and Jake with a variety of ice creams tattooed on his arm (they're in it for the long run).

My kid wanted to try a couple of flavors but the female employee didn't seem to want to allow her any more then one sample (which was a mere speck).  She settled on \"tahitian vanilla\" without trying it.  It tasted artificial, it was icy and the the vanilla bean flecks were crunchy.  My partner and I decided to share a double scoop which allows you to mix up to 3 flavors.  We decided on ancho chili chocolate, cinnamon brittle and caramel with balsamic vineger, all without sampling because of the poor attitude of aforementioned female employee.  The caramel was so repulsive I had to ask for an extra cup just to get it out of the bowl.  Some guy who was working there commented that it was a strong flavor, I said no, it is actually just gross.  The cinnamon seemed to be lacking in anything remotely tasting like cinnamon.  The ancho chocolate was just weird.  We threw out the entire $8 worth of ice cream after tasting a tiny bit of each flavor.

Secret Breakfast (aka Bourbon & Cornflakes aka Breakfast of Champions, as I have dubbed it) is definitely a winner.  Fudgesicle is true to its name.  And Maple Walnut is simple and delicious.  My friend Jenny who went back there recently (cuz darn that lucky bastard actually lives in the bay area!) said the olive oil was also surprisingly good.  So that's to try next time, along with foie gras, which I was sad they didn't have available when I was there.  But the winner for me was the clean Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee Ice cream, which I had fancied up as a \"tin roof\" sundae, which means it was fancied up with fudge, frosted peanuts and maldon salt.  Deelicious!  It was pleasant to have a nice play between the smooth coffee flavor and the saltiness of the peanuts and the sweetness of the fudge.  I was a trooper, making it through my whole sundae while my friends stuck to small cups (regular scoops range from $2.25-4.50).  Sundaes are $6! which ain't bad, they give you a lot of scoopage!  \n   One of my fave things about Humphrey too though is that they have fluff as a topping option.  Heck yes!  Bring on the fluff!  I think a fluffernutter type sundae is on my list for next time I go up to the bay.  \n  The servers were friendly and chatty, the decor simple, a little too simple almost.  All the walls are white and I think they could use some more splashes of color though.  Other than that and a lack of much seating (small stools at a counter, but there are only about 5 or 6 of them) this place is great and you won't be disappointed with your ice cream!", "author": "Emily S."}

A single serving ($3.25) includes two scoops. I chose the Secret Breakfast and the Vietnamese Coffee, a perfect combination.

Well, we got there at dusk-ish, of coarse like everywhere else in frisco, it was impossible to find parking. We circled 4-5 times then just decided to block a driveway.

Coffee, Balsamic Caramel, Honey Thyme, Walnut Maple, PB & Curry, Tahitian Vanilla Secret Breakfast and Milk and Honey  or Honey graham (I think there was graham cracker in that mix I Don't remember) I tasted all except for the vanilla and coffee. The woman behind the counter was not at all pleasant, she was not happy giving me samples, hello... you guys have flavors with names like Secret Breakfast and Jesus Juice among the few, how am I suppose to know how it tastes, if I don't ask for a sample. She was passing me flavors so quick I wasn't able to keep up, and it wasn't like there were a million people in line. Sheesh!!! Please be nicer.  I ended up with two scoops of the SECRET BREAKFAST...YUMMY. The flavors are unique and totally cannot be judged for you. They were a tad too sweet, but hey its dessert. My SECRET BREAKFAST did leave a lardy feel in my mouth after I was done, do they put lard/shortening in ice cream? there was wax like, flavorless flecks in the ice cream I dunno?

I chose creme fraiche & Blue Bottle coffee, a combination that I most mightily recommend to the san francisco latte sipping set.  Divinity!  That coffee ice cream tasted positively Guatemalan!  Who woulda thought one could take a perfectly flavored cup of coffee and make a perfectly flavored cup of coffee, only miraculously chameleonated into cold cream form?  And what's more, they do it in house!  I enjoy watching.  I enjoyed watching the cream get churned in that little frozen windowed room  in the parlor.  I liked Humphry's out of the way location along a strip of 24th street that I hope to explore soon.  I liked the absence of parking, I liked yellow hair and smiles and excellent, freshly scooped ice cream.  And I do indeed love the brown recycled cups in which they served.

Oh well, it was a beautiful day outside. Typically I would simply chalk this up to another SF adventure, but the service was really terrible. We were spoken to as if we were stupid, and as though we should already know the answers to any of our questions. So strange! Back to the ice cream though, the Surprise Breakfast was good.

Some people don't eat pork, but some folks are going to enjoy the prosciutto ice cream. The fact is, there is something for everyone and they are happy to let you sample flavors. I see too many people complaining about the 'weird' flavors... well, if you don't want 'weird', don't get it. Get the excellent vanilla or coffee ice cream that they have pretty much all the time. And I don't understand the people who say that they've encountered rudeness... are you sure you weren't at Bi-Rite, because every time I go there, I feel like the Soup Nazi is behind the counter. At HS, the peeps are ALWAYS super cool. It's a big reason why I go here instead of there. Whatever... both places have a superior product, but I like HS better for the more adventurous flavors and rad people that work there... as for Mitchell's... yeah they're really good too, but I wouldn't put them in the same category as HS or Bi-Rite, so I kinda don't get the comparisons.

Even the samples of olive oil ice cream or salt and pepper were tasty (never really got into the breakfast one, I'm not a cornflakes person). The flavors intrigued me. However, the last 3 times I came back, I was hard pressed to find an ice cream that I actually wanted to eat more than a taste (I'm a fan of fruit flavors over chocolate for ice creams). And this time was the same - I should have gotten the thai lime chili (but at the time, forgotten that I had it before). The Guinness gingerbread was interesting (such that I want to actually make a gingerbread from Guinness) and the pink lady sorbet was really odd tasting (tasted like pepto). So in the end, I didn't get anything but a spoon and chomped on a few bites of my hubbys hot fudge sundae with vanilla. Their fudge is pretty good, the vanilla ice cream, nothing special.

I got Balsamic Caramel, which was good and Peanut Butter Curry that was mouth watering DELICIOUS! It's great to grab a cone and walk around and check out all the beautiful murals nearby.

I just tried Bi-rite the other day and while in their line I met someone who recommended that I try Humphrey Slocomb's, they said it was just like Bi-rite but without the line, this turned out to not be true.  In any case,  I must say that I absolutely loved Bi-rite but I kept my flavor choice traditional with coconut and banana, while at HS I tried a somewhat crazy flavor choice of peanut butter curry, coupled with Tahitian Vanilla.  I thought the peanut butter curry was interesting but it didn't knock my socks off but I really enjoyed it.  I'm excited to return and try other crazy flavors, I love this place.", "author": "L G."}

One of my friends told me about this place and said they had olive oil and bacon ice cream. I was disgusted. When i got there, I was like is this it. The place is so plain and theres not even a lit up sign. BUT then i tried the ice cream flavors. AMAZING. The staff was very friendly and let me try all the flavors I wanted to my hearts desire. Olive oil turned out to be really good. It had a certain sweetness to it that cant be described. Standouts are definitely the secret breakfast and the Vietnamese coffee. I am officially a convert! Love the unique flavors. Now i only wish it wasn't so far out in the mission!", "author": "Kush P."}

I had the secret breakfast (bourbon and corn flakes) and Vietnamese coffee...really good, but they actually gave me too much ice cream for a single!

My hubby and I finally made it down to the much-anticipated Humphry Slocombe this afternoon.  We got 1 Scoop of Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee + 1 Scoop of \"Secret Breakfast\" (bourbon and corn flakes!).  The Blue Bottle Vietnamese Coffee was rich in flavor and had great depth of flavor.  Your typical run of the mill coffee ice cream starts off with a bang of delightful coffee flavor but screeches to a disappointing halt when it comes to elevating your tastebuds to another level of creamy bliss - not Humphry Slocombe's. If you're a Blue Bottle fiend like we are, the aroma alone will win your heart, but the creaminess of the condensed milk leaves you with a smooth milky finish.  The \"Secret Breakfast\" demands your attention because of the bourbon and keeps you interested with the corn flake clusters.  Definitely tasty and unique, but halfway through, I found the bourbon to be too overpowering versus the initial enjoyable zing.  If you want to play it safe, you can't go wrong with the coffee.  I'd have to agree with other yelpers that the texture and consistency of Bi-Rite edges out Humphry Slocombe.  But if you're looking for variety and over-the-top flavors that keep you guessing, try Humphry Slocombe.  Happy tasting!", "author": "Jana H."}

Many flavors and they have the patience to let you try alot of ice cream before deciding on what you want.  My favorite is the combination of Blue Bottle Coffee with the Maple Walnut. But also the Cream Cheese Chocolate Chip is extremely good.   Cookies are excellent.  I have lived in the mission on my life and this is the best ice cream i have tasted.", "author": "Edna T."}

Flavors are a little funkier than Bi-Rite, but all that I tried (and they happily let me try nearly all of them) were delicious.  I had the Thai chili lime sorbet and the coconut sherbet.  Kind of weird to have my mouth on fire after eating ice cream, but I liked it.", "author": "Laura S."}
