We had the pleasure of ordering pupusas; dos de frijol y queso, una vegetariano y una de carne asada. These were the best pupusas I have ever had, it had a great mix of sweet and salty with the cheese and salsa. The cabbage slaw and pickled chile's and carrots that came with the pupusas was out of this world and paired perfectly with the food. \n\nWe also ordered a tamale, and it was good. However, we were not accustomed to Salvadoran style tamales. It was extremely moist but very good! \n\nCheck this place out!", "author": "Jesse C."}

I absolutely love the decorations here.  There are little soccer balls hanging by the window and soccer scarves all over the walls.  There were some parties gathered by the entrance when I arrived but I wasn't sure where and if there was a sign-in sheet.  I couldn't really get the servers' attention for a bit, but eventually I was seated and it didn't take too long.\n\nI ordered the Carne Asada y Queso (steak & cheese) pupusa, Camaron y Queso (shrimp & cheese) pupusa, and the Loroco y Queso (Salvadorean veggies & cheese) pupusa.  My favorite has to be the steak & cheese pupusa because it had the most flavor.  It was so warm and gooey with cheese!  The shrimp was kind of hidden by the cheese, but it was good.  The Salvadorean veggies were a new taste for me.  What I liked was that the pupusas were not very oily, with the exception of the shrimp pupusa, which oozed out with oil.  There was a burnt piece but it wasn't a big loss.\n\nThe food took probably about 15 minutes and they gave some pickled vegetables for the wait and as a side dish.  I enjoyed the pickled vegetables.  They also provided a dish of salsa to go with the food.  Service was friendly.\n\nEach of these pupusas were $3.50 each.  I ordered 3 and was so full, but it was delicious.  If I'm craving pupusas, I'd probably come back here.", "author": "Stephanie Z."}

Don't expect to get any refills unless you ask. They got my drink order wrong. It was plain coffee and a soft drink. The food took forever! And when we got the order of pupusas revueltas (meat & cheese) they lacked flavor. I don't think it had any salt. We got no curtido refill....it was a tiny bowl for 5 pupusas. Service actually didn't come again until the check was due. \n\nLook, I can put up with bad or even lack of service if the food was good. But it wasn't at all.

And I got the chicharron and queso. They're made fresh to order so it does take some time for your pupusas to be made. But when you get them fresh and hot off the grill, it's amazing. The cheese is all gooey as you bite through the soft fluffy corn tortilla. I'm not a big fan of the pickled veggies but that salsa or sauce they give is delish!\n\nI've always ordered it to go and it took about 15-20 mins for it to be ready. But you can call in your order to make less wait time. I would like to dine in sometime and they have beers on tap and tvs to compliment your meal and dining experience. \n\nStaff was friendly and helpful in trying to get our order completed asap. \n\nParking can be a pain in the area as your only options are on mission st or in the residential areas.

Fianc\u00e9 and I shared 4 pupusas- pork, pork and cheese, shrimp and cheese, and prosciutto and cheese. The latter two were from the speciality ones and were more expensive at $3.50 each but had less meat. For more money, I expect the same or more amount of meat. Honestly I think I would be better off getting a plain cheese one for $3. The pupusas are large but I don't know if they're worth $3. Maybe $2-2.50 would be more appropriate. Like last time, the pupusas take quite a while to come out because they are freshly made but of the 4 we ordered, 2 came out maybe 15 minutes later, after the rest of our table was almost done eating. Their other plates look good, too, but I still think most items can be about $1 cheaper.", "author": "Kathy L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-12-10", "description": "Every time I hear the word \"pupusas\", it makes me giggle. It reminds me of two things: the potty and a furry furnace. Tsk tsk, I know; that's what 8 years of Catholic school will do to you.\n\nI'm always weary of any ethnic restaurant listed on 7x7's list. I mean c'mon, they listed Best Chinese: Mission Chinese Food, Best Viet: Slanted Door, and Best Mexican: Tacolicious which pretty much shows their lack of credibility. \n\nBalompie's pupusas has consecutively been on 7x7's Big Eat List for years but I was afraid that it would be just another overrated place overran by hipsters. \n\nWalking into Balompie #3 (#1 location is in El Salvador, #2 is the Mission) and seeing all natives gave me a huge sigh of relief. You know it's legit when you're the only non-natives there right?\n\nBalompie has an extensive menu with salads, soups, Salvadoran breakfast items, omelets and meat and seafood plates.  What they're known for are their pupusas (think a Salvadoran grilled cheese sammie). Unlike La Santaneca and El Zocolo that has a handful of varieties, Balompie has 18! The standard fillings are $2.50 each and the specialty fillings are $3.50 each (minimum order is 2). Two pupusas per a person is  sufficient. \n\nBalompie gets packed on the weekend so there was a 20 minute wait on the Sunday afternoon we went. The crowd died down after 2 pm so if you don't like waiting, you should come for a late lunch. \n\nWe saw several neighboring tables order the yuca fritas so Mr. NSS followed suit and ordered the Yuca Frita y Pollo ($8.75): http://bit.ly/1iTm2Ay. We also ordered three specialty pupusas to share ($3.50 each): Super Vegetariana: Spinach, Mushroom & Cheese, Pescado y Queso: Fish & Cheese, Italiano y Queso: Prosciutto & Cheese: http://bit.ly/18kn9o2 that came with curtido (cabbage salad) and salsa roja. \n\nYuca is a wonderful alternative to french fries as it's loaded with potassium and fiber. The fresh out-of-the-fryer yucca fritas were deliciously crunchy with a tender center. We also ordered a side of crema ($.75) which became a great dipping sauce for the yucca frita when mixed with a few shots of tapatio.\n\nNow on to the reason why we came to Balompie, THE pupusas! I hate paying for overhyped and overpriced ethnic food. Sure, Balompie's pupusas are pricier than your typical $2 pupusa but these were top-notch (corn masa was very smooth) and were very filling. \n\nCutting into the crisp corn masa, all the fillings just oozed out like lava: http://bit.ly/1e3qdrg. My favorite was the Super Vegetariana which was like picking off all the sinfully good toppings from a pizza. It wasn't too greasy or salty; just plain cheesy goodness. The Pescado y Queso was my second favorite as it was filled with flavorful flakes of fish. I know fish and cheese doesn't sound appetizing but this combo works. While the  Italiano y Queso sounded like a winning combo, the prosciutto made the pupusa incredibly salty; way too salty to finish. I would advise not ordering this unless you like hypertension. \n\nThe tangy curtido helped cut through the richness. I wish the salsa roja had more of a kick but nothing that tapatio couldn't solve. \n\nA family owned restaurant, service was very warm and friendly. Food does take a while to come out (~20 minutes) because they also have takeout orders but it was worth the wait. It would be nice if they provided complimentary chips to nosh on while waiting for our food. \n\nSit at the counter and watch the ladies make your pupusa to order or you can sit at one of their 10 two-top tables and watch some soccer playing on the flat screen TV. \n\nFinding metered street parking is easy but if you're patient, you can find non-metered parking after several circles. \n\nMy only gripe is that Balompie closes at 10 pm unlike La Santaneca and El Zocolo that closes at 3 am on the weekends. So much for sloshed eats. Then again, nothing good happens after 2 am...", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

They are very generous with the cabbages and sauces and you can always ask for more! My favorite pupusas are always the pork/cheese and spinach/cheese but honestly, you cannot go wrong with any of their pupusas! They are also very quick with their service and the staff is super friendly! Their plaintains are also soo yummy! It is made with just the right amount of glaze and the portion is large enough to share between two people! \n\nThe restaurant is decently sized and is at the corner of the street so it is very easy to spot!

I waited thirty minutes for mine.  So it was only fitting to find the best of the best pupusas, and since I was also having an interesting \"car adventure day,\" being towed, having car repairs in the last 48hours, this was the place to be!\n\nI invited my BFF who lives in Bernal Heights. I popped my trusted YELP and saw several reviews from my esteem YELPER friend \"Loon E.\" - who by the way has outstanding reviews that will get you laughing so hard you will be peeing by the time your done.\n\nAfter reading his reviews from different locations nearby, we decided with Balompie Cafe. I must say - amazing. Loon recommended we try LOROCO Y QUESO.  Oh my god - this was sooooo good.  It was literally melting in my mouth.  It had that fresh lite corn tortilla crunch taste to it with a soft fresh filling of cheese and veggie inside. It was not at all greasy.  Large portion too for only $2.50 each, they were very generous. And since we were already there, we decided to order more and try their Fish, Beans, Steak and Cheese pupusas too.  They were all delicious but I have to say the loroco y queso was the bomb! Insanely good!!!! Thank you Loon E. for this awesome recommendation. Oh and don't forget to order their fresh Horchada, the fresh grounded cinnamon was outstanding.\n\nMay I also suggest you try their shrimp soup which by the way was out of this world too.  It was not shrimp pasty at all. The broth tasted fresh and they gave us a large portion of prawns to boot!  It also came with two plain pupusas as compliments of the dish, diced onions, fresh parsley and slices of lemon. And for only $12.95, this would be good for one if you are very hungry, or for two to share. \n\nIf you are in search for authentic, taste like homemade pupusas, I highly recommend coming to this very cute neighborhood corner gem in \"The Mission.\"  It is hip, clean, service is excellent, and the food is simply delicious.

So when she makes it a point to recommend a little place located on the quiet side of Mission Street you must heed her words of wisdom and make your way there.\n\nBalompie 3 is an absolute gem of a restaurant. The minute you walk in you are greeted by the super friendly staff. The restaurant is clean and decorated with futbol memorabilia on the walls and two large flat panel televisions on either mounted high on the walls where you can catch a glimpse of the River Plate and Boca Junior game in high definition. \n\nThe dining room is small, yet spacious and open. The kitchen is clearly visible from most of the tables where you can spot your breakfast order being freshly and prepared by experts in El Salvadoran cuisine. The menu is authentic and all your favorites are included. On this Saturday morning, three of sat down to feast on as much as we could and sampled each others choices. My wife went with the huevos con chorizo, this dish is served with refried beans and rice. The eggs were perfect and not overcooked. The flavors of all the ingredients were shining and my wife throughly enjoyed her meal. I went with the Number 19, plantains with crema and refried beans. This dish is served with a little cube of goat cheese which I am telling you right now, do not overlook this tiny little box of cheese goodness. Sprinkle a little on your beans as the saltiness of the cheese combined with the richness of the beans are a match made in Heaven. I also got an extra side of eggs over medium which helped round out the dish. \n\nMy wife and split an order of papusas, one bean and cheese and pork and cheese. Both were delicious, but surprisingly we agreed that we preferred the bean and cheese. A word of warning, these things are filling and even after 5 hours am still completely stuffed and cannot ever imagine eating again.\n\nA nice selection of salsa, cabbage and pickled jalepenos and carrots accompanied our food along with a side of thick hand made corn tortillas. I also made certain that a bottle of Tapatio sauce was brought over which I then used to sprinkle on my beans. \n\nThe service is excellent and the waitstaff made sure that our coffee cups were always warm and water glasses always filled to the rim.

The appearance surprised me.  It looked like tuna salad.  The shredded beef was chopped so finely and was also super dry. It's simmered for hours and the recipes I looked at said the beef is supposed to be tender.  I liked the salad flavors and the textures (except the beef).  Tapatio and a squeeze of lemon helped with the dryness.

Just to be extra sure we wouldn't go hungry. \n\nI've been slackin on my Big Eat SF list and since my partner in crime Patty P. has already been here, I was happy to snag another friend who was wiling to go with me, so I can check off another item:\n\n#32 Pupusas at Balompie Cafe #3\n\nWe decided to get two of each and try three fillings:  Spinach and cheese, beans and cheese, pork and cheese.   These doughy pancake-like thick tortillas are definitely cheesy and a bit greasy as well. The pork was too salty for my taste and the beans didn't really do it for me.  I was surprised that I liked the spinach and cheese pupusas the best.  You get a small bowl of pickled vegetables, which counteracts some of the saltiness of the pork.   Chips and salsa are complimentary while you wait for your pupusas. \n\nBe aware that you get charged a little extra for dining in.  (Pupusas are $2.50 each compared to the take out price of $1.95)   There were quite a few tables available for seating and the bathroom is clean.  It was cold inside so definitely bring your coat with you.  \n\nWe stayed here for two hours and our server was nice enough to constantly check up on us but didn't kick us out.

Everybody's kind of said why the food is great, but I wanted to throw in a few fun facts:\n\nFirst, this Balomie is Balompie #3, and the one on 18th doesn't have a number (presumably it is #1), but I always wondered where #2 was, turns out (from their website) it's in El Salvador!  Doesn't get much more authentic than that, where the #2 is out of the country.\n\nSecond, at this location (as opposed to the one on 18th) you can watch the cooks make the pupusas right there, slide them on a plate and put them in front of you about 3 feet away.  They are masterful, and fun to watch (and study for technique!).", "author": "Katie W."}

The pastel (like an empanada) we chose had chicken  and our yuca was steamed and came with grilled shrimp. \nThe pupusa was very flavorful, but a little oily for my taste.

We saw that the pupusas at this place is on the 7x7 top 100 things to eat in SF for this year so we had to get some. The famous one according to the list is the chicarron (pork) pupusa. It was one of my favorite from the night. They are fresh made to order and it tastes so good with the cheese and meat. My girl and I both ordered 3 different ones each and shared. We got the Italiano which comes with prosciutto which you can probably skip. It was tasty but not amazing. We got the shrimp which was my favorite of the night. The seafood was fresh and went well with the sauce and slaw that comes with your pupusas. We also got the fish and cheese which was equally as good as the shrimp but I've always had a soft spot for shrimp. My fav. All the seafood pupusas were my favorite from this night as well as the chicarron. Perfect flavor combos with the cheese and sauce. So bomb. We also got chicken which was also good and ground beef which you can also skip. Overall a good spot to get your grub on and it's not too expensive.

I am giving them 5 stars and really hope it stays there, but I do have to do some more exploring here. Came here one weekend morning as part of our pupusa/tamal crawl through our new neighborhood. It is a really neat, cozy little cafe with flat screen TVs, a coffee bar, soccer playing non-stop, and beer on tap! Never seen a Salvadorean restaurant quite like it. \n\nAnyway, I ordered the pupusas revueltas with beans, pork, and cheese (about $2.50 each) and one that I think was called an Italiano that had prosciutto in it (about $3.50). I also ordered two tamales, one chicken and one pork. Finally, I got the pollo guisado, one of my faves. All of this was to go and I ordered a coffee while I waited. The pupusas were awesome, probably the best that I have had in my neighborhood so far. I actually liked the revueltas better than the Italiano, but all were good. The tamal de puerco was fantastic as well, but I was really sad that I did not receive the tamal de pollo that I ordered. All is forgiven though because they also did not charge me for it. I appreciate the very kind lady trying to watch my weight for me and I would have picked the pork over chicken anyway. \n\nThe pollo guisado was just alright and would have knocked them down to 4 stars. It was breast meat and was very, very dry. I didn't even think to specifically request dark meat, but I'm sure it would have been much better with dark meat. Nevertheless, this still was not the best guisado that I have had, so maybe I will just stick to something else in the future. The reason that I did not drop them down a star is because the have beer on tap. Not just that, but they have Sierra, Blue Moon, and I think it was Newcastle on tap for like $3.50-4.00ish. They also have some Salvadorean and Mexican bottle beers for the same prices. Also, the atmosphere is just so cool. Not your usual hole-in-the-wall type of place. Don't get me wrong, I love those places, but this place was very refreshing. Would love to come here for brunch with friends sometime soon, maybe catch some Futbol!", "author": "Miguel V."}

Balompie Caf\u00e9 most definitely ignited my pupusas craving in a monstrous kind of way. Not in a gruesome fashion, but more like cookie monster's obsessive craving for cookies. \n\nBalompie Caf\u00e9's Pupusas are without a doubt one of the best pupusas I have ever eaten. I would even say it's one of the best food I've ever tasted. For me it's a tossup between the oh so delicious Shrimp Pupusas & Cheese and the comparably succulent Fish Pupusas & Cheese. I've also had the Chicken Pupusas & Cheese, but that's a distant third in my book (although my wife really loves the chicken). Like what you have read in many of the other reviews, they make the pupusas fresh and as you order them, so there will be some wait time after your order. \n\nThis corner caf\u00e9 is not very roomy, so it could get very crowded, but I personally love little caf\u00e9s because it adds that coziness and informal feel to the place, see Brenda's French Soul Food. The atmosphere really shows the owners passion for soccer, obviously evident by the endless soccer reruns shown on the flat screen TV above the refrigerator. \n\nI really don't have any reason why I wouldn't give this place a 5 star rating.

Their pupusas are still my favorite, let's make that clear. My gripe is, usually you're served chips, salsa and that pickled coleslaw stuff as soon as you're seated. Well, I got salsa and pickled coleslaw but no chips. I gave the server a few minutes to redeem herself thinking she was either busy or just forgot. Apparently I wasn't the only one - the table next to me had to ask for chips. I figured, great, maybe she'll bring me some. \n\nNever happened. \n\nA few minutes later, I saw her throw the bag of chips away in the trash. I assumed it was down to crumbs and she was going to open up a new bag. \n\nNever happened.\n\nBy this time, my pupusas were ready and the server brought them over so naturally I asked for chips. She told me they were all out. I was a bit disappointed but it wasn't a big deal. But before I could even cut into my pupusa I heard her say, \"Excuse me...\" I looked up and to my utter amazement, she had pulled the bag of chips out of the trash can with this look on her face as if to say, \"unless you want these?\" \n\nTo her defense, I don't think she was trying to be rude or offending in any way, although I was a bit insulted.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-07-17", "description": "3.5 but I will round up because I expect it to meet those four stars soon.\n\nI have been eating at the OG Balompie on 18th Street for almost 20 years.  *gulp*   TWENTY YEARS!!!  Um, yeah I've been eating there since I was 2 years old.  Sure.  Yeah, that's it. . 2 years old. . . \n\nAnyway in the battle of pupusa greatness, to me, Balompie #1 has always come out on top over Panchita's, Zocolo and La Santaneca.    The fillings are always abundant and the dough is always tender and not greasy.  Their curtido is balanced and tasty.   Also, their caldo de pollo is my  I-am-so-sick-I-want-my-mommy therapy.\n\nThe only draw back of Balompie #1 is that it is ALWAYS crowded and the seats are packed in tight so you always feel cramped or rushed or infringed upon . . ..Balompie #3 is small but the tables are spaced well so that won't be a problem.  \n\nThe restaurant has only been open for three weeks and they are offering a fairly limited menu (compared to Balompie #1).  The star of the menu are the pupusas.  They have your usual suspects - cheese, revueltas, loroco, ayote, etc.  They also have \"Specialty\" pupusas. . .three with the stomach churning combo of fish, shrimp and cheese - not my cup of tea but three other ones - the Mejicana (sic) which is a mixture of ground pork, jalapenos, & cheese; the Italiana which is prosciutto and cheese and the Gringa which is seasoned ground beef and cheese.    They offer both the corn masa and the rice masa. . .my boyfriend likes the rice masa so he always gets those. . .I  much prefer corn masa.  He got the chicharron and queso (revueltas) in rice masa and I got the Mejicana in corn masa.  I also got an Italiana because, well, I had to. . . it sounded bizarre enough to work.  Being the fromage-o-phile that I am you must understand that what I am about to say goes against the very fiber of my being. . .the pupusas were good but not great because. . . .are you sitting down?. . . .there was TOO MUCH cheese in them.  I know.  Crazy talk.   But the balance was thrown by all that cheese.  I was piling on the curtido to balance out the richness of the cheese.  Also, the pupusas broke which isn't such a tragedy because the crispy cheese ooze is such a bonus but ALL of them were broken and mis-sized so their are a couple of consistency problems (see my pics).  But I did really like the mejicana - the combo was good and I liked the jalapenos and the nice kick they added.  So how about that Italiana?  It was GENIUS!  Seriously delicious. . .a good amount of prosciutto but not so much as to be overwhelmingly salty, cheese (not too much in this one) and fresh oregano leaves. . it worked.  My dream would be to have a couple of those with two fried eggs atop. . .it would be the breakfast of champions!  As stated earlier, Balompie #1 as the best curtido and that is true here as well. . also make sure to get some escabeche - theirs is so good!  We also had a side of casamiento which was a tad dry.   They are frying up fresh chips and they are delicious and the salsa, which is traditionally very low key - here it is actually quite good.  We also had some jamaica which was very, very good - not too sweet but not bitter or tart either - it went perfectly with our meal.  \n\nI went again last night to get a quick bite and had the Gringa which was very good - this time not too much cheese but a little greasy from the ground beef.  But good.\n\nI am excited to know that they will be open until midnight on Friday and Saturdays - you just never know when you might be overwhelmed by a desire for pupusas and now at least their is a fairly late night option out there.   \n\nSo why only three and a half stars?  Well . .. one thing is that they charge different prices for eating there or to go.  It's weird and off-putting.  Their menu is limited - I will update this review when they add a few more items - especially my beloved caldos and if you sit in the front two window tables at sundown you will hate your life. . .it's hot, bright and you have to eat wearing sunglasses - please my darling friends at Balompie #3 - get some shades for those windows!

A couple of bar seats at the counter, but I was impressed!  We ate in, and were quickly attended to.  The place only got more crowded as the night went on.  Maybe it was the futbol (aka soccer) game that was on.  They had a TV, but I have to say I didn't notice who was playing.

She spoke both English and Spanish well, which made communication easy for everyone.\n\nMy Jugo del Dia (Melon) tasted just like a fresh cantaloupe - delicious!  Chips and salsa were immediately placed on our table, and while the chips obviously came out of a Costco-type bag, the salsa was good.  Watery, but good flavor and just a tiny kick of spice.\n\nI had the #14, which for $8.50 included 2 Pupusas con Arroz y Frijoles.  I chose to have the rice and beans Casamiento, which meant that they were mixed together and formed into a little mound.  It was SO good!  I chose a Carne Asada y Queso and a Gambas y Queso pupusa.  Both the steak and shrimp were good, especially when I put some salsa and the coleslaw stuff on it, but nothing fantastic.  They weren't greasy, but there was a little too much cheese for my taste, and I wished they had more flavor before I put the toppings on them.  The spicy vegetables served in a side dish were really good - especially the cauliflower.\n\nIt was a good meal and friendly service, but I'd probably try out a different pupuseria before coming back here again.\n\nOh, and to comment about the other review I saw about a hair in the food - all of the cooks were wearing hairnets the night I was there, so hopefully no more hairs in the food!  :-)", "author": "Lindsay B."}

CLOSED on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThis place is the complete opposite of the chaos of the one on 18th Street.  No rubbing of the elbows of the person next to you, and that's the only way this place lacks.  There are a a few tables, a counter, and even a few tables outside.  Why you would want to eat outside at the sometimes seedy corner of Richland and Mission is beyond me, but it that floats your boat, it's available to you.\n\nI bought some pupusas to take home.  Four chicharron and cheese, 4 ground beef and cheese, and two bean and cheese.  The ground beef pupusas was a bit lighter than the chicharron, and not quite as tasty, but a refreshing change.  if I had to pick, it would be the pork.    You can also get them filled with prosciutto, and another filled with pork, jalapeno and cheese.\n\nOther unique fillings are available such as FOUR different kind of vegetarian pupusas' for you vegetarians our there.  They are:  1) Zucchini, 2) Loroco, 3) Spinach, and 4) Super vegetarian, with spinach, mushroom, carrots and cheese. (WHAT?  No celery?!)  Well, 5 if you count the beans.\n\nWhile this location lacks the multiple dishes as that on 18th Street, they will likely have more later.  One dish sounds very good ... Salpicon; chopped beef with mint, radishes, and onion with rice and beans.  You can get your Tamales, Pasteles, and Empanadas.  Prices are a bit cheaper for the pupusas if you have them to-go.  To go, they are $1.95 - $2.95 versus $2.50 - $3.50 if you eat inside.\n\nWill it replace the venerable La Santaneca?  Maybe.  Very cute server with a winning smile.", "author": "Michael M."}

Overall a nice place for a good lunch/dinner. The food is very good and fairly priced. Hearty food which is for the most part, prepared in front of you. The staff is efficient  enough and most times offer a friendly smile. I like the pupusas, but again, hard to say the \"best ever\" since there are so many good pupusa places in SF. If anything, maybe they are just a tad skimpier with the queso than other places. But the mesa is fresh and cooked just right for my taste. Excellent pickled cabbage. Good place to take your hipster friend from Kansas who has never even had nor even thought of eating \"Mexican\" other than Taco Bell. \"Oh my God, this is SO cool!

When I walked in, the restaurant looked nice and clean and smelled really good. \nThe waitress greeted me and asked if I was dining in or taking the food to go. I said it was to go and she gave me the menu.\nWhen I looked at the menu, I was shocked to see that there was a price difference between the food to go and dining in. But I was starving so decided to order. \nI initially wanted to order the 2 pupusas plate that came with rice & beans. When I asked if they had black beans or pinto beans, she said no. I asked a few more questions about the menu and she began to get annoyed and gave me a little attitude so I decided to just order a few pupusas.\nThey were good but not great.

That being said these things are freaking yummy. Why was this not brought to my attention before? \nI haven't tried all the flavors of the pupusa rainbow yet but so far my favorites are the zucchini and loroco. I don't really know what a loroco is either but I like it. I had the super vegetarian which was alright and the ground beef which I don't think I will get again. It was just too rich. My friend got the prosciutto one and it was so good he refused to part with a single bite. \nThe staff is quite nice and they don't mind the intense scrutiny while they are making the food. It is just fascinating to watch.\nI always get it to go (all 3x I have been) because my house is less than a block away. The delightful proximity to my domicile makes it highly unlikely I will try the other locations. \nI think they started serving breakfast which I am excited to try after a night on the town.

They are supposed to be a bit greasy - that's what makes them so delish!  Remember that you have to put the cortido (pickled cabbage) inside and that balances it out.
