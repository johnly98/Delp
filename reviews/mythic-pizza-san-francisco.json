{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-05-31", "description": "The only reason why I'm setting this as a four star is the location is a little uncomfortable for a suburbian like me, and the place is kind of small so there isn't much room if you plan to eat there with a large group of friends. I would say it could fit 8 people comfortably.\n\nI'm unsure about why other reviewers have 1-starred this mainly because I've had my share of pizza and I've hardly seen a pizza slice this big, with the dough an impressive balance of soft and crunchy yet not breaking the bank when you're looking for a simple late night bite. I had their pesto slice and their Hawaiian. Maybe once the toppings get more complex and heavy the pizza doesn't hold on its own, so I'll come back and try more toppings to see if it holds up and is consistent.\n\nThe staff even late at night was patient, and it didn't take too long for them to whip together a fresh slice from the oven for me. They have Costco-sized chili pepper and parmesan cheese readily available if you're into those add-ons for pizza. They do put a very generous amount of what I think is mozzarella cheese, and it does look like they don't integrate the toppings into the dough. It's more placed on top than baked in, but still delicious nevertheless.\n\nVerdict: Coming back, if I'm looking for a quick and dirty yet satisfying slice of pizza while I'm in the area.", "author": "Michelle R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-01-19", "description": "My review is about the delivery service and not necessarily the pizza itself. \n\nI ordered pizza from Mythic Pizza in San Francisco through the Yelp app on my phone, which I have done a number of times. The estimated time for delivery was 45-60 minutes, and I got home about 25 minutes after ordering, around 2am. When I arrived at my house, there was a car waiting outside of my building with its flashers on, which I thought nothing of since I was early for the delivery time. I walked up my steps and began to fish for my keys. Mind you, I'm female, alone and it's the middle of the night. I looked over my shoulder and realized that the delivery person was there, but there were two men approaching me.  One guy gave me the pizza, and the other pulled out a crumpled print out and started pointing at the word \"cash\" and stating the word tip very loudly over and over. \n\nBesides the fact that all of this is done through the app, their appearance was extremely intimidating and I was worried for my safety. I was cornered at my door in the middle of the night, with a pizza being delivered by two aggressive men, which I have never had happen before. It made be nervous even to put my keys in the door as I wasn't sure of their intent.  I told them I did not have any cash and waited for them to move away, which they did, but the whole experience was intimidating and scary. Additionally, and likely not coincidentally, I had another friend also order from the same place at the same time and the SAME thing happened to her with her delivery - two guys demanding cash in a very aggressive manner. It could not have been the same people as I live in NOPA and she's in the Mission, and our pizzas were delivered at the same time.\n\nI will not be ordering through Yelp nor from Mythic again in the future as I do not believe this is a safe delivery service, and wanted to share here so that others may be aware.", "author": "Elizabeth W."}

But when your pizza delivery leaves you concerned about your safety, it's time to find a new favorite. \n\nOut of my last 3 orders, 2 left me feeling at best disappointed, and at worst, scared. Order #1 took place on a Sunday afternoon. Est Delivery time was 45-60 minutes. After an hour and a half, the pizza hadnt arrived. I called 5 times and kept being told \"it would be here soon\" with no explanation. After 2+ hours it arrived, and the guy had a car full of friends. The pizza was cold. I called and asked to speak to the manager and kept being told he doesn't take calls from customers. Eventually they gave me his cell number and I got my pizza refunded. Whatever. \n\nThis Saturday, I ordered pizza through Yelp/Eat24 and was told it would arrive within 60 minutes. I waited 90 minutes, no pizza. I called, and the pizza magically \"arrived,\" with two guys waiting outside my apartment demanding a tip, yelling in my face. It was about 1:45 am, and I am a woman, alone, with two men standing outside my apartment threatening me. They were waving a paper in my face, \"proving\" that I needed to pay them a tip in cash. I refused, called my boyfriend, and eventually they left. Strangely (or perhaps not, since it seems to be common practice), this exact situation happened with a friend of mine this same weekend.\n\nIt's a shame... pizza is supposed to lift you up!

Mythic sells thirteen kinds of pizza by the slice. While waiting in line, I wondered how they had so many pizzas ready to go. Did they have a back room somewhere with rows and rows of pizza waiting under heat lamps? My theory is that they really just have a bunch of cooked, untopped pizzas waiting; when you order, they pile on the toppings and throw it in the oven until the cheese melts.

But with that being said, *an* option for late night eats is better than no option at all... so Mythic does a pretty great job of filling a void in the marketplace.\n\nThey have all of the standard variations you'd expect, but what I really dig about these cats is that they have a by-the-slice option for us wacky vegan types! The slice is loaded with all sorts of veggies: mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, peppers, olives, etc... all devoid of any cheese whatsoever. And because there aren't very many plant-based eaters coming in for drunk munchies, their slices are made to order and haven't been sitting under a heat lamp for hours on end and simply reheated in the pizza oven. It's about as perfect a situation you can ask for, frankly.\n\nIt bears repeating that you really need to lower your expectations if you choose to eat here, after hours or otherwise.

I told the a$#hole to give my money.  I'm out.  \n\nImo, excluding the circumstance above, the pizza is shitty and this is coming from someone that loves pizza and tries to give places a chance to shine.

Within 15 minutes we had a new, piping hot pizza made exactly how we wanted it. Even after all that, I'd say it was worth the wait.

We got the haight medium pizza to go because all of the seats were taken, but since the prior customers left once we got our pizza, my girlfriend decided we should stay instead of scarfing the pizza down in the car.

Last night after a few drinks I decided to get a slice of pizza, knowing full well that it was probably a bad idea.  To be fair, I have been eating more or less vegan for the past 7 days (I'm visiting and trying to get as much non-dairy grub in as I can before returning home to Miami where vegan restaurants are virtually non-existent).  But give me a few drinks and my dietary ambitions are thrown out the window.  \n\nFast forward to arriving at Mythic Pizza, ordering an Athens (artichoke, pesto, garlic) slice and devouring it all within a span of 15 minutes.  Taste-wise, it was ok, definitely nothing that I would expect to violently rape my colon, intestines, and stomach a mere 8 hours later.   \n\nIt took me a while to gather the momentum to push the diarrhea from my anus, but it was only a split-second afterward, that I found myself flushing the contents of the toilet, kneeling (no time to wipe), and purging all that is evil out of my mouth and into that recently defiled bowl.  The pizza chunks flew out so forcefully that droplets bounced back up, landing on my face, beard, and lips.  There was most likely residue from the previous shitstorm that had just been, albeit probably not completely, flushed.  After 8 or so power pukes, I finally felt ok enough to get up, clean myself off, and tell myself, \"it's over.\" \n\nBut it is not over.  I have been in bed all day.  My stomach is still gurgling and I fear another ass and mouth episode happening before the day ends.  \n\nHeed my words and never eat this pizza late at night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-09-21", "description": "I've been to Mythic a total of three times. I went the first time a few years ago and had a slice while drinking at Toronado. At that time, I exclaimed that it was the best slice of pizza I had ever experienced. The second time, I was again drinking quite heavily and got a slice late at night. I recall that it was good. However, somewhere deep in the trenches of my drunken stupor, a flash of clarity hit - this pizza isn't as good as I remember it. I quickly warp back to a drunken stupor and forget everything. I parade around Haight St., with a pizza sauce spattered smile. Flash forward, just a couple nights ago, after having gone pizza free for months, fairly sober and hungry, I decide to get some pizza to end the night right. Now, since it's late, about 10 pm, I decide to just hit up a corner store for some frozen pizza. I just want to make a pizza in the confines of my own home and not deal with the public intoxication going on. Tried and true, for me, a large DiGiorno always seems to do it. It's not the best frozen pizza, but I know it guarantees a certain level of satisfaction and, shit, if you bake it long enough it gets crispy. How many pizza places can get a good level of crisp? I hit one store - no DiGiorno. Shit. I hit another store two blocks away. Sold. Out. I think \"Jesus, I wasn't the only one on the hunt for some shitty frozen pizza.\" Worried, biting my nails, eyes darting around nervously in the middle of Lower Haight, I know what's about to happen. I'm going to get actual pizza. All the pressure of possibly getting screwed by bad pizza at a late night shop comes down upon me. I think, there is the place towards Wing Wings and then Mythic pizza. I think - \"Mythic can do this for me. Teach me all the wrongs of frozen pizza - set the night straight.\" Once again, I charge down Haight St. As I pass the burrito place, a thought darts by. It says \"Dude, what if the pizza actually sucks? Go for the burrito. At least you know the burrito will be good.\" I shut the thought down immediately. I'm determined to have pizza more than ever. Fuck off rationale thought. I walk in Mythic, pretending to be a regular. Couple tables filled, a few drunk people and, of course, people just like me - the look of feeling a little ashamed but also determined. We eye each other quickly and feel a bit better. We do a subconscious nod to each other - we're here for the same reason. I look at the menu, immediately land on the Tijuana because it has jalape\u00f1os. It also has sausage. How could one go wrong? I friggin' love spicy pizza. I order a small pizza. I can't be certain if I want one slice or five. Better to be safe. I want my options open. They tell me it will be 15 to 20 minutes. Cool. So I chill outside for some time, walk around a bit, come back, wait around, hands in my pockets. We all know what's up. Eventually, a man charges from the kitchen to the counter, pizza in hand, exclaiming \"Teeeaaawwhhuuaaanaaa!\" Hell yeah. I grab the pizza, slam it on the counter, throw open the top, a waft of pizza soul hits my nose. Checks out. I vigorously shake out red peppers, parm and oregano. Check. Check. Check. I hit the street, go into defensive-fast-walking mode and make it to the pad safe and sound. I plop down on the couch, place the pizza box on the coffee table and open the top. I stare at the pizza for a few minutes, allowing it to cool for a bit. A bit of panic hits me when I don't see any visible sausage. I think - maybe it's under the cheese. Be cool man, be cool. It's going to be good. After waiting a reasonable and expected amount of time, I lift a slice. Dear fucking god. The crust lifts but the pizza itself falls limp under the weight of the toppings, which come sliding off like a goddamn waterfall. A sinking feeling hits me - a feeling of darkness and loss of hope. I manage to quickly salvage the toppings and push them back on the slice, holding it now like a floppy New York fold. I do that awkward two handed grasp on the pizza and come in for the kill. I bite down. It's all jalape\u00f1o, a smidge of sauce and only a hint at what could be cheese - indistinguishable. One more bite, two more, I kill the slice. I look down at the pizza, hands messy with sauce, mouth on fire and overly acidic from the abundance of jalape\u00f1os. I have but just one thought - where's the fucking sausage? God damn, I think they forgot the sausage. Another second passes. I realized that I have no sense of richness from the cheese, no umami from the crispy oily crust, no thought of \"goddamn, pizza sauce is so underrated these days!\" No. This pizza reflects none of that. It was shit. Pure and simple, the worst slice of pizza I had ever had. I decide to inspect the pizza. Wait. The sausage is there. I see little broken up pieces underneath the cheese. I taste a piece. Flavorless. What have they done? At that moment, a tear comes down my eye and I realize what once was great pizza died a long time ago. I pour one out and turn away.", "author": "Matt S."}

The sheer bass in my voice alone would have caused a panty-dropping domino effect up and down Haight street. The pizza was ready in a few minutes. You should have seen the way I shook that crushed red pepper up on that slice. It was regular pepper when I first grasped it, but after a few vigorous shakes, I crushed that shit. I'm mad nice like that. The guy must have been some sort of prophet because that ninja knew enough to call me boss in the first place. I guess this was the mythic aspect of the pizza experience.

I was slightly drunk the first time I had it and hungover and craving something greasy the second time. (These instances were weeks apart thank you very much). One will eat some pretty awful things in both these states, so my conclusion that the pizza sucks should speak for itself. Here is my theory on how the slices are made: they cook a large cheese pizza, leave it out for a while, and then when you order a slice they pile on all the things promised for you particular selection (except of course, if the sign says bacon which they're out of, so they use ham, hoping you won't notice) and then they send it back through the oven for about three quarters of the time necessary to actually melt this second layer of cheese or sufficiently warm up the added ingredients. This results in an awkward mound of room temperature toppings on an over-cooked crust.... and then they are a little rude overcharge you. Same experience both times, different slices. Sad, this place is right across from where I live and while a late night neighborhood pizza joint is an excellent alternative to all the other weird things one might eat at 3am, I think I'll stick to home-made grilled cheese when i need my late night cheese fix.

We tried Mythic Pizza tonight and were underwhelmed. The buzzer at our apt. building hasn't been programmed with our number yet, so we were waiting downstairs for our pizza. A car came to a stop in front of our building, and the driver hopped out and opened up the back seat door. But a perplexed look appeared on his face as he looked back and forth between an order ticket and the back seat of his car. He climbed back into the front to take off, but Andy asked if he was here for Mythic Pizza...? Yes - came the reply - but I forgot your pizza! Ha! I was amused but Andy was confused. The driver offered an additional explanation: he delivers for (at least) two different restaurants, a Mexican place and Mythic... and he only had Mexican food in his back seat. But he promised he'd be back quickly - and he was. \n\nSo honestly, the two stars aren't for the delivery mix-up, but for the mediocre pizza. We tried half pepperoni/ half sausage and mushroom. We requested they go light on the cheese per many earlier reviews. I'm not sure if they complied because there were pounds of cheese on the pizza.

That's what I (happily) get there.\n\nWant a topping on your slice? Sure, It doesn't make a difference - throw pepperoni or sun dried tomatoes on a slice before it gets reheated in the oven, and it comes out great - simple! \n\nHowever, let's say you want a specialty slice, one of the ones further down the menu. That's where the trouble starts. First you hand over $4.00-4.75 for ONE SLICE (this blows my mind). Then you receive back a weighty wedge with toppings just thrown on without regard to the noble cheese slice they sit on. It's like dumping a handful of steamed carrots on angel food and calling it a carrot cake. \n\nExample - on the ambitious, 4+ topping orders, the bottom has been severely overcrisped from the added cooking time of the extra toppings. Sometimes a whole bunch of plain mozzarella cheese is melted on top of the toppings, on top of the slice. It's cheesier, sure, but it's not backed up with any extra pizza sauce, thereby throwing off that CRUCIAL ratio on a sauced pie. It's for people who like toppings, not a properly double-cooked pizza slice.\n\nAnd then, take the pesto slice - good idea, right? Crust, mozzarella, pesto. Beauty in simplicity. Here, however, they take that same perfectly good cheese slice and slather on a mound of pesto. Red pizza sauce and pesto do not and have not ever mixed - I've experimented before and it makes sense that no other pizzeria has ever put them together and sold the result. It's a waste of a good slice and a LOT of pesto (they drown the slices in the green greasy stuff).\n\nI'll be back for slices of cheese here and there, sure. The service is friendly and attentive, and the quality of the pizzamaking is fine. But as a place that seems to earn its bread and butter from slices, there's a lot of improvement that can be made.", "author": "Party C."}

Going back during the day sober, i found my assumptions to be true. The pizza is shitty, and is only amazing when i'm plastered out of my mind. However, yesterday my dear little boyfriend who lives across the country decided to buy me a pizza and have it delivered by surprise, and then called to let me know. They told him a half an hour. Over an hour and 15 minutes later, after calling three times and having them lie to my face and say the driver had left already (i live literally three blocks away), the very RUDE delivery driver showed. He asked to see the card. Now, I know this is standard policy (to see the card to confirm it), but my boyfriend is not a fucking idiot. He asked them if that would be okay, and just to rush him off the phone (this is a usual thing), they didn't listen to him and just said yes. All I said to the driver was \"oh, i thought he told you\", please hold on for one second...\ni went to my room to find an alternative method of payment, (transactions can take a couple minutes sometimes..), and i came back, and he left!!!! HE LEFT!!!!!!!!!!! Outraged and hungry as hell, I went down there to give them a piece of my mind, only to be yelled it in a bunch of jibberish i couldn't understand. I WILL NEVER NEVER NEVER GO THERE AGAIN AFTER THIS. Granted I was drunk most of the time, but i dined there 3-4 nights a week. they all know me. and to be treated like absolute crap as a regular customer who wasn't even a big fan to begin with, is the end of the line. I can't believe such a shithole treated me as if they didn't need my business.", "author": "veronica g."}
