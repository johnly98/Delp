Unfortunately, since it was a meatless Lent Friday for me, I didn't get to try a lot of their chicken dishes like their chicken tikka masala and chicken tandoori.\n\nDespite not being able to try their meat selections, I thought their veggie options were still very filling and flavorful.  I had a lot of their chana masala, saag paneer, and mushroom stew.\n\nOverall, the buffet was okay.

My employer gives me $20 gift cards to this restaurant every month. Tonight I ordered delivery to my office since it was a late night at the office. When I ordered I tell them I will be paying cash, and I have $40 (20x2) worth of gift cards, and will pay the remainder in cash.  The delivery man comes in 25 minutes, which is in the window I was told I should expect. I present the $40 of gift cards and a $20 dollar bill for the remainder of approximately $3. I planned on giving a $4 delivery tip. The deliveryman has no change. He calls the manager and says I can pay with credit card. I tell the manager on his phone I would like to pay the remainder $3 plus add a $4 delivery tip. The manager on the phone says $10 minimum. I explain that the deliveryman can't even break a $20 bill, and this is a customer service issue. He says again $10 minimum. I explain again that I can't justify a $7 delivery tip on a $43 cash order to someone who can't make change for a twenty. I do have three dollar bills in my wallet, short a couple of cents from the exact of the roughly $43.xx. I pay and he leaves. 20 minutes go by and I get a call saying they incorrectly billed me and need $2 more. They say it was because I asked for a discount. I never asked for a discount, I said I had two gift cards.  I agreed to pay the $2, a mistake on their end, but said they would need to break a 20. They said they could. I said I would leave the office in 45 minutes. They said they would be there in 20 minutes for their $2. An hour goes by since I had more work than I thought and I leave the office. I call the restaurant and told them I was leaving and to call off the deliveryman collecting the two dollars.  They said they would call him and notify him to not come. \n\n20 minute later he calls me and says he is at my office and where I was. I told him I left and notified his manager to contact him. He cussed at me. I had a 13 hour day at work with no breaks, this was the breaking point. I cooperated with their measly $2 mistake by agreeing to pay.

Hands down the absolute worst Indian food I have ever had in my life by a long shot! Food was beyond terrible. Absolutely no taste for the lentil soup and coconut lamb. No seasoning, no salt, nada.

Chicken tikka masala was nothing but a cup of watery tomato sauce and like the lamb, the chicken was missing. Just 3-4 small pieces floating in tomato slop. I paid $40 for 3 cups of watery tasteless slop, no lie. I'm beyond pissed off and feel so ripped off. Just gross and rude. \n\nHow dare this establishment rip their paying customers off with such carelessly prepared food! Highway robbery.

When we were there we ordered fish curry, Gobi Aloo, Sag Paneer, Lamb Vindaloo,  biryani and naan.

I make it at home at lease couple times a month. Their Lamb Vindaloo taste like three cubs of lamb cooked in tomato sauce. Vindaloo suppose to have over 10 different types of spices and strong taste of turmeric in the end.  It suppose to be spice, sour, and savory. There was no spices in the sauce. It was $14 for three pieces of lamb in tomato sauce with three other pieces of potatoes.  Worst Vindaloo attempt ever. \n\nSag Paneer was okay. \n\nBiryani was flavorless. would have been nice if they put any kind of spices in the rice. \n\nGobi Aloo was Okay \n\nFish Curry didn't have any curry flavor.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-04", "description": "I ordered from this restaurant because I had a gift certificate. I noted that it is nice that delivery is free and until 22:30. Kudos to the delivery driver who actually came inside the building too! However, I realized after opening my order that I did not receive two of my items, despite that I had them repeat back the order before we hung up initially. \n\nThat's when I discovered that this restaurant has the WORST customer service. The man I spoke to barely spoke English, hung up on me twice, and kept repeating himself that I had actually received everything like he thought he was a real-life Jedi.\n\nIn detail: When I called to let them know the items were missing, they of course did not answer because by this time it was a few minutes after 22:30. Then when I called the next day once they opened for lunch, he asked me accusatorially why I didn't call sooner if I was missing items yesterday. After I explained that, he just started repeating \"We checked the order twice. You received everything,\" occasionally throwing in a comment that really annoyed me, \"Please don't do like this.\" I believe I spoke to the same person the night before and the next day, and his English was so poor that sometimes it was hard to tell when he was just being a jerk and when he was literally not comprehending. Ultimately, I asked his name and to speak to someone else. He claimed he could not spell his own name (Mani? he only mumbled it as fast as possible) and had the audacity to tell me that nobody else worked in the restaurant, ever. \n\nI finally called back later in the day (nobody called me, as I had requested) and reached someone else who was much nicer (Paul?). The hilarious thing was that the jerk actually tried to take the phone away after a minute (\"thank you for waiting\"--in the middle of the new, normal productive conversation) and I had to make him give it back. Paul's English was only a little better but he did have the courtesy to interact with me the way normal sane people usually do with customers. Finally, he said next time I ordered to remind them and they would give me the two missing items for free. Unfortunately, I don't think there will be a next time. I am just glad I had the certificate or I would be much more upset about the loss.\n\nAs for the food, the malai kofta was flavorful and arrived hot, and the medium spice was a perfect amount of heat in the flavor. That was the only good thing about the whole experience. The breads I ordered (keema naan, pratha, and onion kulcha) left quite a bit to be desired. I am pretty sure I received naan instead of pratha--pratha is delicious and buttery and flaky-layered, and is described the same on their website: \"velvety layered\". What I received was dry, thin, and almost a little burnt. Maybe it was a terrible chappati because the jerk on the phone tried to tell me it actually was pratha because \"pratha is just wheat bread.\" So upsetting. But I certainly hope that it was not a true sampling of their pratha. The onion kulcha was fine but could have had more fillings and was a bit burnt at the edges. The keema naan (and the kulcha) were at least moist and doughy but there was no meat at all in what they insisted was the keema naan, which is supposed to be stuffed with ground lamb. Lastly, the vegetable pakora (fritters) were at least crispy but they were practically all fry dough and almost no vegetable, and were also a little burnt at the edges.\n\nOverall, the one good dish might have balanced out the subpar side dish situation and this restaurant would have gotten probably 3 stars when combined with the convenience of free delivery as late as 22:30. (The malai was good enough that I might have otherwise tried to order some other dishes another time.) But, given the mediocre food and excessively poor customer service experience, I think this restaurant deserves only 1 star and no further business from me.", "author": "Sora E."}

I went there set down and waiter came with a miserable face telling me to change my table because the other table was half dirty and he does not want to clean another table. Ok ,no problem I can change my table but do not say it like I have to do it, he did not even ask he showed me the table and told me to sit there. How awful, never been treated like that my entire life ,very very very rude. When I complaint about his attitude no one seemed to care in the restaurant, they were all like 'Yes,we hate our jobs and no one cares about us and we dont care if you dknt like it,you can leave.' That was exactly their attitude if not worse. You can see the hatred in their eyes to their jobs. Omg so awful.\nThe food was not good either, everything is swimming in some red sauce,blunt,tasteless and you can see how old it is ,sitting there for god nows how long!

He only ate the garlic naan bread, which he dipped in curry. He mentioned he didn't get to chicken, because it sunk to bottom of curry which makes me kinda suspicious '-' Naan bread was burnt in some areas and chicken tikka masala curry wasn't spicy enough for him, but I did order it medium! He ate like half of one of the samosas. The restaurant sounds promising from what majority have said. They delivered quickly and ahead of scheduled time. Two veggie samosas, chicken masala, garlic naan and a 7Up came out to 21 dollars. Not including tip. I went crazy on the tip in hopes they would REALLY deliver! On my end, transaction was smooth and Yelp ordering was great~ you can choose level of spicyness so that's a plus..

I gave it many chances, going 5-6 times a year for about 3 years, but I officially give up.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The food is good.  It was the only thing that kept me coming back, and it's the only reason why I'm giving 2 stars instead of one.  Their pakoras are tasty, their tikka masala sauce is tart and tomatoey, their tandoori chicken is moist and flavorful, their curry chicken is fantastic, and they have a delicious cheese cube thing in a tomato-based sauce that's amazing.  Taste-wise, Great India is one of my favorites.  But what good is that when the food is often NOT AVAILABLE?\n\nYes, I always go for the lunch buffet and MANY times I find the trays dead empty.  The turnover rate  for new food is slow.  And the service is often negligent.  There's only a few good waiters, and the majority of them are not attentive or do not care.\n\nBut despite the spotty service and inconsistency in availability of food, I kept coming back.  I like their food (when they have it) and I like to support local business, even though they are sometimes not perfect.  I always gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Then came the final straw.\n\nLast Sunday, 1:30pm.  Partner and I walk in for lunch buffet, which is advertised as 11:30-3pm 7 days a week.  Note that we are nowhere near the cutoff.  Starving, we go straight to the buffet, piling our plates with rice first.  I reached for the two pakora trays and noticed that they were both empty, the only thing remaining was the sign.  Ok, no biggie.  I can wait for the fresh batch.  We moved on to the next tray.  Beans that we don't like.   Skip.  The Tandoori chicken tray had just one tiny piece of chicken left, barely a scrap that was undoubtedly connected to bigger piece.  Starving, I grabbed it anyway.  Then we came to the chicken tikka masala.  My partner swirled the ladle around in the sauce.  \"There's nothing here,\" he remarked.  Ah, but he is good at wet food hunting.  This man can bring up the tiniest piece of tendon or tripe in the most opaque leftover pho soup in existence.  Sure enough, he manages to find exactly TWO pieces in the sauce.  He takes one and generously offers me the other.  We both ladle tikka masala sauce over our rice.  The curry chicken is next.  I grab some but my partner skips it because he doesn't like it.  And that was all there was.  Rice, beans that we don't like, one tiny piece of chicken tikka masala each, and curry chicken for me.  They usually have a dessert too, but no dessert this time.\n\nWe take our plates to the table and hungrily dive in, glancing over at the buffet occasionally to check on the status of new food coming out.  15 minutes pass and nothing came out.  We were both still starving.  I wandered to the buffet to see if maybe I had missed them bringing stuff out.  I noticed that they had taken away some of the trays that had signs on them.  The chicken pakora sign was taken away and replaced with just veggie pakora (which strangely  only consisted of onions.)  Both the chicken tikka masala and chicken tandoori signs were taken away, replaced by one big tray labeled \"naan\", which was empty.  The only thing that remained on the buffet was white rice, the beans we don't like, and curry chicken.  I glanced at the clock.  1:50pm.\n\nI went back to the table and remarked sadly to my partner that they won't be bringing any more food out.  Bear in mind that at this point, my partner has only had a heap of white rice, and one piece of chicken tikka masala.  He was livid.  He told the waiter he wasn't paying for his \"buffet\".  Starving, I continued to eat my curry chicken and rice.\n\nAs I ate, I saw a tour bus pull up right in front and about 30 Indians pour into the restaurant around 2pm, an hour before the buffet was scheduled to close.  My partner pointed out that we were shafted because the restaurant was expecting the tour group so they prematurely took away all the buffet food.  As the restaurant became crowded with the noisy tour group, I abandoned my plate and paid for my bill (the restaurant did not charge my partner.)  As we were leaving, he told the owner/manager that we were never coming back again because there was no food in the buffet.  \"I'm sorry,\" she said, \"but we had this group coming in...\"\n\nSorry lady.  If you have a group coming in at 2 and you know you'll be shutting down the buffet at 1:30, why did you not tell us when we walked in?  Because you didn't want to miss out on that $24+ tip from us?  Sure, we would have left and gone somewhere else, but we would come back next time.  And now that we were disrespected and shafted, we will NEVER come back again.  You made your $12 from me this time, but you've lost years of future repeat business from me and my partner.\n\nMy advice to those coming here for the lunch buffet: SCAN THE TRAYS FIRST TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY FOOD.  IF NOT, ASK THEM IF THEY PLAN TO BRING OUT MORE.  Even if it's well before before the cutoff time, don't assume.  Ask!!", "author": "Tee B."}

There's a bunch of rating stickers and a sign that reads \"Bathroom is for customers only. Please try to keep our bathroom clean.\" However, the inside of the restaurant is immaculate. Even the bathroom, which I was expecting to be gross, was super clean - looks like it was remodeled recently. I guess the cleanliness stands out to me, since Naan 'n' Curry can be quite disgustingly dirty.\n\nBack to the food - we ordered a garlic naan, onion naan, rice, the chicken tikki masala, and the green spinach curry. It just so happened they were the two curries featured on the menu's cover. The Chicken Tikka Masala was our favorite - homey, rich, satisfying.

When we have guests from out of town, and I've been cooking for most of the visit, we give a lovely send off by ordering from Great India.  My tab usually comes to between $80 and $100 because we have so many people to feed. (And, that I can order through GrubHub and pay with Paypal is a huge advantage.)\nThe food always arrives hot and fresh; they pay very good attention to the level of heat that I request. There are so many dishes that I love, I would be stretching my consciousness to attempt to list them. My recent choice of coconut fish curry has knocked me sideways.  The selection of breads is wonderful, and whatever saag I choose is flavorful; any protein involved is succulent.\nI was born here In San Francisco, and as you may imagine, there were few to no Indian restaurants at the time.  The first one I ever visited was Gaylord, somewhere in the early 70s. Great India does such a wonderful job with their food, that I do not miss Gaylord at all.\nGive it a shot folks....if you know what to order, you can't miss.", "author": "janice s."}

The server told us they've been getting busses of hungry tourists almost every day for the past few months, great for business!\n\nGreat India offers buffet dinner, as well as a la carte options.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nGarlic Naan - warm and doughy, not overpowering garlic flavors.\nBaigan Aloo - Eggplant cooked with potatoes and fresh tomatoes\nLamb Biryani - Indian bashmati rice cooked with lamb, nuts, spices (this dish has powerful flavors and can get a little spicy so make sure you get water!)\nVegetarian Samosa - Crispy Puffs Filled With Potatoes and Green Peas\n\nOverall, service was fantastic even after the big group showed up.

Hey, it was a Tuesday night, and we wanted something entertaining to do. \n \nIn search of Indian food, we consulted Yelp, and the only place we could find along the 38 line in the general vicinity of our destination was Great India.  It was only 3.5 stars, so I was a little nervous.  Even more nervous when we walked in, and there wasn't a customer in sight.  I attributed it to the location - it's way the f--- out there.\n \nGlad we risked it; everything was actually pretty great (between 3.5 and 4 stars, but I'm rounding up).  I ordered a Bud Light, and it was only $2.75.  Sister ordered a mango juice, and it was delish - pure fresh mango.  Next, they brought us out that flat, cracker like \"bread.\" (no, I'm not talking about naan).  With that came four dipping sauces ' chutneys, all perfect complements to each other - two spicy, two sweet, all very tasty.\n \nWe ordered a naan that I'd never heard of - cherry, cinnamon, and some other sweetness.  We were feeling adventurous!  As far as naan goes, it was good, and a little different in texture than what's normal (at least in my naan world).  I'm used to naan being soft and stretchy, but it was kind of crispy / flaky on the outside, and soft (and sweet) on the inside.  \n \nThe main entrees - I had the paneer tikka masala (cheese with masala sauce) - again, between 3.5 and 4 stars.  Very good, especially when I dipped the naan in it.  My sister had the mushroom korma, and that too was delightful.

I was craving Indian food so I did what I regularly do, I yelped for Indian: Delivery in my area.\n\nI skimmed through a few and discovered this place. I've probably passed by this place a million times too.\n\nI ordered the Chicken Vindaloo. It was really good. A little spicy but still good. I was really surprised how good it was. I wasn't expecting much since I saw a 3.5 star rating and they deliver. Most delivery restaurants aren't usually very good but this place was. I also ordered 2 garlic naan. Usually when I order 2 garlic naans they are usually about the size of a small personal pizza. This place makes it big. It was like a medium size pizza. So I had an abundance of garlic naan. I have to say it was really good. Most places don't put enough garlic. This place use a lot which I like. \n\nThey also automatically give you 3 sauces. They were good. I like the red one with onions in there. It's sweet and spicy and good with the naan bread. \n\nOh, I would like to also mention the nice Asian delivery guy. Super polite and nice. It's nice to see a clean cut looking delivery guy. (you know the typical delivery guy is usually not the cleanest looking guy...no offense...).\n\nI was going to give a 4 star rating but when I think about it there wasn't anything I could ding them for. The delivery was delivered in about 35 minutes like they said, delivery person was nice and friendly, food was good + unexpected 3 sauces. Reasonably priced for a delivery meal ($19 + $2 tip).

Every dish comes with either a HUGE bowl of rice or a ton of naan - you'll definitely have leftovers to bring home if you dine in.

All the different varieties of naan in the bread basket were delicious, so no complaints there!  \n\nEven after eating a huge Indian feast and bringing home boxes stuffed with yummy leftovers, we only paid about $13 each.

Although they now answer the phone and take your order immediately, without a wait or a call-back, don't get too excited. There's a reason they're not so overwhelmed with patrons these days and it has little to do with the sour economic climate. (Sour economic climate? What? Where? I forgot...this is SF). \n\nThey now charge MORE for LESS and the quality of the food has suffered. Before, the real draw for take out was that you got free rice or naan with each entree/curry. This is no longer the case. I am cheap. I am jewish. It is Yom Kippur. I'd like to keep in line with some tradition even if boy and I chose to stay home with friends' kids and eat Indian instead of go to temple and atone for our insurmountable mess of sins accumulated over the last year. So there.\n\nI'll give them this: for around $50, we got three curries, naan, rice, pakora, and samosa but the serving sizes have declined (I'm not fasting- I already told you- I'm a bad person), the saag paneer was more goo than saag or paneer, the Chicken Tikka Masala was tasty but basically consisted of chicken in masala water (I like my sauces thick), and there were about 10 small fritters of pakora. The Samosas and Aloo Ghobi were well worth the two stars above and the swift delivery and improved ordering system get them a reluctant third star. \n\nI'm not over Great India, I just don't think they're as great as they were a couple of years ago. But then again, I'm not either. Great India, let's both of us go to temple together tomorrow, atone the hell out of our sins, and then share some war stories over mountains of your old delicious menu items.

The combination of excellent food and affordable price was just unbeatable.\n\nUnfortunately as of last fall their \"award winning chef from India\" left on some sort of trip, supposedly to return in mid January. I know this because my Indian friend had a chat and passed the info on to me, but it was sadly apparent by the sharp decline in the quality of the food. The rice was yellow and oily, tikka masala was bland and watery, the palak and aloo dishes could pass as the same thing to a blind person. Abysmally disappointing.\n\nI've been back several times since the expected return of their chef, but the food is only marginally better. Maybe they are cutting costs and reducing the key ingredients, or maybe their apprentice is getting the hang of things, but they still have a long way to go before matching Great India's prior excellence.\n\nBottom line: 2.5 stars (rounded up). I just cannot recommend it as strongly as before; it's passable at best.

My biggest complaint with Indian food is how heavy it is and Great India solves that problem for me because they don't use ghee (clarified butter for you plebeians). The end result are dishes in which I can actually taste spices instead of 100% fat. Mushroom mattar is officially my new favorite thing to eat, ever. And and and the curries come WITH rice or naan! No more paying extra like a sucker. Marvelous!\r\n\r\nUpdate - Ordered Great India again last night and it was again, absolutely delisious. Wonderful tandoori chicken, nice sour raita, and really lovely buttery pratha. And TWO samosas for 2.99. Great India is absolutely the best delivery Indian there is in the city. I declare it, so it must be true.\r\n\r\nPS - You can order online via delivery dot com even if the site only lists it as a pick up option with your address. Simply order it for pick up and write \"deliver to (your address)\" on the notes. Voi-la! Had their chicken tikka last night and it was wonderful, not as creamy as other CTM's but with actual spice and a little bit of cilantro. I've also noticed that delivery comes really quickly if you order online, so go ahead and use that instead of calling.", "author": "Maria D."}

Not by a stretch. It is however the best Indian lunch buffet I've ever visited. Which is not to be confused with the best Indian buffet I ever had, which was at the Rohet Fort outside of Jodhpur. \n\nWhat was great about that buffet was that we had the entire place all to ourselves. Out in the middle of nowhere, a Maharaji castle where Bruce Chatwin wrote the Songlines. When we got there the house band serenaded my French friends and I. Then a thunderstorm came and we jumped in the pool. Smart huh? Then we hit the buffet and there was this curry with the smallest whole eggplants you've ever seen.\n\nAnyway the grub at Great India isn't that good, but it was good enough to take me back to Rohet for 20 minutes, and it only cost 10 bucks.", "author": "Jason R."}

I mean, I don't think there's a doorstep in San Francisco left unadorned by the Great India takeout menu. And it's decent stuff. Heads and shoulders (or should I say, naan and raita?) over Star India or India Palace for delivery food. \n\nEating in was a strange experience. Kind of like seeing someone in person for the first time who you've known only over the phone. (Actually, exactly like that.) Like your favorite customer service rep you have to call all the time at work. You start to develop a picture in your head of what they look like, how they dress, etc. Great India was a little frumpier than I expected, which was made more noticeable by the fact it was completely empty. To be fair, it was 9:30 on a quiet weekday evening. And, as you might expect, they appear to do a gangbusters takeout business, since while I was eating in I saw at least five white bags go out the door. \n\nBut it was nice to eat in. The service was adorable, the tandoori fish and chicken were both well-spiced and cooked through. (Nothing is worse than undercooked Tandoori. Well, maybe spoiled children in airports.) Chana masala was delightful; a rich, brown sauce like a vindaloo. Too often the chickpeas are weak, you know? Everything comes with rice or naan, so order a few entrees and you'll get a huge bowl of rice and plenty of non-oily bread. Which is an extremely good value but also total fucking torture if you're on a diet. \n\nAnyway, it was pleasant, and if I'm dining in the neighborhood again perhaps I'll eat in. Realistically, though, I will probably continue to order it in, because I am really lazy. Which is the reason I'm on a diet in the first place. So fuck it. I will walk the 2 miles to Great India when I want it. A NEW ME IN 2007, PEOPLE!!", "author": "Megan W."}

Having to listen to complaints through the meal, it takes away from the ... je ne sais quoi, if you will, and makes the digestive process a little less enjoyable. So to make a long story short, I advocate for the Biryani.\n\nAnd I'm not disappointed at Great India. For one thing, the food arrives (delivered, courtesy of waiter.com) fairly quickly, and the portions are overly generous. I have a tough time plowing through the basmati with its complement of nuts and spices. I usually go with the lamb - tender and done to a turn. All is well and I'm in the process of giving this place four stars.\n\nMy companion on the other hand is severly displeased. Her bold font \"NO CILANTRO\" has been ignored and caused her to spend the first ten minutes fishing the offending leaves out of the curry (she got the chicken tikka masala) and when she takes the first bite with a handful of naan the salt content brings back memories of the dead sea. Duly she proceeds to complain and I'm less content with the meal.\n\nNow I should technically give them two stars, but I understand that all Indian food tends to have cilantro in it. Asking for no cilantro is like asking for no tortillas at a mexican place. It doesn't make sense, and one should know better.

Despite our guilt for not wanting to walk the 1/2 block trek on a cold Saturday night, our laziness outweighed our embarassment and the following conversation ensued:\n\nMoi: Do you think we picked out enough food to not feel guilty about ordering from around the corner?\nThe bf: Yeah.  Just.. I dunno.  Pretend you don't realize they're around the corner.\nMoi: When do you think they'll realize the extent of our laziness?  As soon as I give them the address or by the time they leave the restaurant to deliver us our food?\n\nIt turns out they realized immediately and didn't seem to mind in the least.  The food was good, we tried the combo biryani (chicken and lamb), chicken tikka masala (the bf is hooked on this stuff), garlic naan, and lamb samosas.  \n\nThe chicken tikka masala was pretty good; not as great as the Indian restaurant my friend bartends at (the name of the restaurant escapes me, but I'll re-edit this post when I remember), but it was pretty darn good.  The chicken did not taste like it was overcooked -- which is one way for a restaurant to not go over well with me.  The naan was good, too.  It's hard to mess up naan, but when you do, it's disasterous.\n\nThe biryani was awesome.  Very spicy, very good.  And the portion was huuuuuge.  We had leftovers for quite awhile.  I am also addicted to the white sauce that comes with it (it tastes like cucumbers, with the consistency of something thinner than ranch dressing.. I have no idea what this is called).  \n\nIn order to beef up the order a little bit, I also ordered drinks.  I ordered the mango lassi and their chai tea.  I was interested in how they would deliver these drinks; the lassi was delivered in your standard fast food drink cup, the chai in a round to-go container.  Despite the odd packaging both drinks were very good.  They even included the sugar for my chai tea!!\n\nThe only major disappointment was the samosas which were literally STUFFED with lamb.

The salad dressing was not that tasty, so we didn't press that issue.

The one thing I would get again would be the fish (salmon) curry.  4 ppl, 4 appetizers and 3 entrees paid about $50 (incl. tax & tip). \nLost stars because I had to keep requesting for my glass to be filled with water when the place was empty (there were only our table and another seated).

Boo for serving us water with NO ICE...Boo for my soda having 3 ice cubes...Boo for warm mango shake...do they not see the sun outside?  Sheesh.  Another boo for super duper slow service when we were the only people in the restaurant.  Food was good though, I'll give them an extra star for that.

Also,  they started leaving in whole cardamom pods (I think it was cardamom) and whole bay leaves. Neither of which are very good when bitten into. Who does that?

A couple of weeks later when I was balancing my checkbook I saw that they charged 29.00. Now, normally I wouldn't get so upset at $2.80, but the fact the someone helped themselves to my hard earned $2.80 really pisses me off. I called the manager, who insisted he would check the credit card receipts and call me back. He never did. I called again 2 days later and another person (or was it the same person?) tried convincing me for a good 2 minutes that I must have written exactly 2.80 as a tip. Now, first of all, I have a very strict system with my receipts (being anally obsessive compulsive is good for something) and record every cent I spend to balance my books each month. Second, why would I have written in 2.80 rather than 2.00 or 3.00? Last, I know that I didn't leave a tip because I remember thinking to myself, \"self, why would you leave a tip for an order that you picked up\". \n\nBottom line, $2.80 isn't much, but sometimes principles matter.

But then I found this gem - good food, good prices, and they deliver!\n\nIt isn't the best Indian food I've ever had, but it's definitely solid.  I'd rate the food an 8/10.  The chicken tikka masala is my favorite here - the only complaint I have is that the chunks of chicken can be slightly dry in the middle (so I just break them into smaller bits and let them sit in the sauce for a few minutes - problem solved!).  Other than that, it's great.\n\nThe fact that they deliver is a big plus.

I ordered three dishes and was surprised to find that we couldn't finish them they were so much larger then any of the other restaurants I've been to. And the mango lassi was the perfect touch of sweet to all that spice! The only downside was the service.

The buffet closes at 3 so the food had been sitting for a long time. The rice was so old it was crunchy. The lamb curry was dry, as was the tandoori chicken and everything else. There was two peaces of dried out naan left but they made me some fresh naan that was good. I imagine if I had been there around noon when the food was fresh I may have been more satisfied but even then the flavor wasn't that great. Over all the food was that I would expect Indian food to taste like from a truck stop along the interstate in the Midwest. I don't think i would recommend Great India to anyone. Theres lots of Great Indian food in this city but in my opinion Great India is not one of them. Again please keep in mind what I said in my first sentence.

Before coming to this restaurant, my boyfriend and I looked at their website to see their menu.  We had two $10 gift certificates we wanted to use and decided to use it on our day off.  The website looks really nice and when I saw the picture I thought the place was really nice too with that dining table there (but then odd with the Chinese character painting on the wall).  Plus we looked into Yelp to see how many stars they were given and decided it must be not bad.  \n\nWell, when we arrived to the restaurant for lunch, I found out we passed by this restaurant many times before but never tried it out.  In addition, I also found out the restaurant inside was pretty old, plain, and DEFINATELY not like in the website (no wonder there's a painting of the Chinese character on the wall...it's not even their restaurant!).  Feeling a little cheated but excited to try out this new place, we were shown to a table with a beverage menu, given two glasses of water, and sat down.  Both of us decided to order two chai and looked around waiting for the waiter to come and ask us what we wanted.  After a few minutes looking around, we found out everyone else seemed to be eating from the buffet and that the waiter wasn't going to come ask us unless we waved him down.  Well, that's what we ended up doing and wondered why we weren't given a full menu.  Is it because they only have buffet served at lunch?  The waiter wasn't even sure and said he had to ask the chef which turns out they do serve things in the menu.  \n\nAfter all that, we got our menus and ordered the onion naan, coconut chicken, and chicken pakora.  I never had chicken pakora before so I can't say how much better it can be but their chicken pakora was \"good\".  As for the coconut chicken with the onion naan: \"yum yum\"!  I wasn't into the chicken but loved the sauce with the naan.  Although I think it can be made tastier, it was good enough with the sauce being sweet, creamy, and tiny bit spicy.  As for the chai...ehhh...rather tasteless. =(  Kind of a disappointment considering it tasted mainly like hot milk with a bit of chai taste to it.  Naan and Curry's chai on Irving tasted much better the last time I was there (which was rather long time ago..~2 years).

And, while I do understand that Indian cuisine tends to utilize lots of curry in their dishes, their chana masala was rather spicy (for me).  And, the rice was rather plain with not much of the saffron present to color or flavor the rice.\n\nBy comparison, India Clay Oven has more variety and their curry dishes aren't nearly that spicy.  Please bear in mind, I've eaten at both establishments and have made definitive comparisons from my experience and observations.  However, I am not endorsing either restaurant over the other.  Just stating the facts as I am seeing them.\n\nI will say that the sit-down service was good, they are very polite and attentive, and it is quieter than a Chinese restaurant (they tend to be very noisy).  However, even at lunch time, they don't have that many customers, either.

The potato curry with the mushrooms, the daal, and the saga olif (spell?) were out of this world, and I even went for a drumstick of tandoori chicken (moist, sweet, and not too fatty).  Their yogurt sauce was perfect... not too bitter, and the chunks of cucumber were long and stringly, kinda like onions (which I liked) ... I mixed it with their tamarind sauce and doused my plate with its creamy richness.

After he hung up on me I got a call from someone else claiming to be the driver (with a distinctly different voice and accent) saying that he was on some cross streets 14 blocks away.   I explained the problem and eventually got my food.  Unfortunately they lost at least a year of consistent business from my roommates and I.", "author": "Nate W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-10-17", "description": "Depending on the selection, their buffet can go from average to spectacular.  The buffet is inexpensive.  The staff is friendly, and they're getting better at refilling water without having to be flagged down.  The mango lassi is definitely the best.  It's wise to go early, before other people get there.  Unlike other buffets, this one seems to have customers who reuse their plates.  Yuck!  And the staff doesn't say anything.  Perhaps they could put up a sign, like I've seen at other places.  My only caveat is that I seem to fall dead asleep twenty minutes after finishing my meal.  I have just enough time to drive home and walk in the door before I'm out for several hours.  And it's not just me but everyone I bring there.  This only started happening maybe six to nine months ago because I remember feeling wide awake after eating there a long time ago.  So I don't go there very often now, unless I'm craving some spicy food.\n\nUpdate: after having eaten my way down the penninsula at various lunch buffets, I find this place is better than Suraj (Redwood city), Bombay Garden (San Mateo), a second one in San Mateo I can't remember the name of, except that it had a dancing area, and Amber in Mt. View, for various reasons.  I guess it's the $6.45 price, along with the consistently good quality lamb (very large, lean, tender chucks with no gamey flavor) and large chicken breast meat in the other dish.  Tandoori's good here too, but I usually eat the lamb.  This place is wonderful if you are a carnivore, as the vegetarian dishes change out and is inconsistent in yumminess.  For example, the mung bean dal was absolutely, terrifically wonderful (I wish they would make this a standard dish like they do with the lamb and chicken), but I don't care for the brown colored chili dal.  And when they have eggplant, I'm in heaven.  The mango lassi wasn't as good as I remembered, but I don't fall asleep after eating here now, either.  So, that's a pretty good exchange, I guess.\n\nI would suggest that they wipe the linoleum floor in front of the buffet station because it always seems sticky.", "author": "A P."}

Some of the reviews here are pretty harsh. It's agreat place to go with a group of people.  The highlights on the menu are the Chicken Korma and Banghan Barta.  Overall, one of the better Indian restaurants in the city.", "author": "Marko C."}

Today I decided to try India Clay Oven on Clement instead of Great India---Big Mistake!!!!  The buffet food at Great India is delicious and they actually have dal, unlike the aforementioned restaurant.  The only reason I'm giving Great India 4 stars is because they don't have soup on the buffet, and neither did the other place.", "author": "leigh m."}
