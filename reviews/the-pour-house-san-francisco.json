They have a deal only on Tuesday's for a bottle of wine and a cheese platter for $25!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!! We got a nice 2015 petite sirah that was surprisingly very smooth. \n\nBut the PLATTER!!! SO good for the price. You get HUGE blocks of cheese, 2 types of crackers, an assortment of nuts, pickles, and olives. We opted to add prosciutto to ours which was an extra $17 (yikes) but completely worth it.\n\nFriends and I also stayed for a couple hours and were not pressured to leave ONCE.

I felt bad, but I mentioned to the waitress I did not like my wine, and without hesitation she offered to switch it out. She gave me a taste of the Zinfandel which was a winner. This upgraded my review from a 3 to a 4 because she was so nice about switching out my wine. I did really like he ambiance here. It was cutely decorated but a little bright.

What a great name first of all and the setup is actually kind of refreshing. There is a lot happening on  polk street. When you go out on a Friday or Saturday night it can get hectic with all the drunk people and yelling. It is nice to be able to slide into a place like this and feel like you are off the beaten path. \n\nI love wine bars and this place did not disappoint. I especially liked the vibe in the place. They were playing some of the silliest shit I have ever heard played in a bar let alone at a wine bar. They went from 70's to tone loc to backstreet boys to tlc all within an hour. I couldn't tell what would be played next and it was a game to sit with my date and try to talk over what the next crazy song would be. What is great is the people there loved it. I think that is actually they vibe they are going for there. A weird wine bar and they are proud of it. \n\nIt keeps the pretentious people out which is a great thing for me. It was never too crowded when I went there. The staff was always nice and the ladies behind the bar were wonderful. When i last went there was a couple that was making out the whole time. They got so into each other they climbed on top of each other and spilled their drinks on my date. The bartender came over and gave us free drinks for having to put up with them. The best part was the couple didn't stop. I had to turn around as hands started going under shirts!\n\nThe first time i went my date was terrible and the bartender knew it wasn't going well for me so she filled my drinks extra heavy and winked at me as my date continued to talk about her love for donald trump and other absurd things. This place will always hold a special place in my heart because of that. \n\nThere aren't actually a lot of choices for wine here which is odd for a wine bar but the choices they do have were satisfying and you really aren't looking for anything to special when you are wine bar hopping on polk street. It is a great place to check out if you are done with dinner but want drinks or want to go out on a date or with friends but not face the college frat and marina crowds in Mcteagues and other places on polk.

We ordered the California reds to share, which was a selection of three wines. The wines were served in shot glasses rather than wine glasses, which I felt was reasonably unprofessional, but was forgivable considering the flight was only $14.\n\nThe pours were fairly small, but again we paid only $14 so we didn't expect much. I tried the first wine and it was awful. It tasted like cat piss. I'm not one to complain and I generally like most wines that I taste, but this was just dreadful. My girlfriend had already tried the first two wines and she said the second one was worse. I tried that one and she was right. It tasted like the cat had dropped a turd before he pissed on it. Finally I tried the last wine and it was just blatantly and unquestionably corked. Each wine was just utterly undrinkable; I would have much preferred they served us three glasses of two buck chuck instead.\n\nIt was an interesting experience really. The first wine was the worst wine I had ever had. But as I tried each successive wine, they only got progressively worse as each new tasting unseated the previous for the title of inglorious horribleness. The service was pretty awful too, but that may have been because I was loudly complaining to my girlfriend about how bad the wines were. When someone finally came I emphatically spoke my mind about the barely touched wines. She dumped them out and gave us the full bill.\n\nI'm not one to complain about restaurants or bars. This was the only time in my entire life I've ever sent anything back or complained to a server about the quality. But something is not right here. If there's one establishment of any kind I would recommend someone not go to, it is the Pour House in Nob Hill.", "author": "Aaron G."}

Plus after a long hiatus, I'm starting fall back in love with beer. Ideally, the Pour House should be the meeting of two fabulous worlds, but it was just OK.\n\nSome friends picked me up along the way so I didn't have to worry about relying on mass transit in the city. That immediately put me in a good mood. Plus it was Friday night - TGIF!\n\nAs we walked in, there was late '90's pop music blaring. At a wine bar? Really? We giggled and grabbed a booth. The boys ordered beers and my gal pal and I each had a glass of vino. The beers were awesome! The wine? Meh, not so much. It was a generous pour, though, especially for a $6 glass. So cheers to quantity over quality. My friends also ordered a cheese plate, which came out with mixed nuts, olives and two different kinds of cheese. They ate most of it, so I can't speak for that part of our experience. \n\nSince the music overhead kept getting louder and worse, we decided to leave. It wasn't offensive or anything, just not the kind of vibe we were going for. With many other awesome wine bars in SF and beyond, I just wasn't that impressed. But if I was in the 'hood and wanted a cheap glass of wine, this would be a good place to start.", "author": "Abby S."}

We went on a Saturday night and didn't have any problems finding a seat and the bartender was quick to come over welcome us and help us pick out a bottle of wine for our group. Out of all the bottles I surprised that he recommended one of the cheaper\nBottles on the menu. We ordered the Pinotage Ernst Gouws & Co 2010 from South Africa. It's a red and has a really bold kinda fruity and smokey flavor to it! The bottle ran us 26.00 and they charged us 1.00 for a bowl mixed nuts. At the end of the night they told us that they sell all of their bottles of wine for 40% off of the listed price on the menu! \nOnly downside is that as soon as we walked in (9:00) the jazz band was packing up to leave. I love live music and would make this part of my rotation if they had music late on weekends!\nBut over all we had a great time and for 5 people and our bill only being 35.00, I am sold.", "author": "Roxy H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-21", "description": "Almost didn't post this after seeing all the great reviews but... Very disappointed. I work in the area and have passed this place more than a dozen times. 2 stars because the location is cool, the name is clever and I don't have it in my heart to give 1 star. My experience at POUR HOUSE was like buying infomercial anything; not as good as advertised. \n\nNow I understand you're on Polk street and this is an easy sell to weekday warriors who are ignorant to good wines but really? The name is \"POUR HOUSE\" with a wine glass on the signage. So, show me the money [wines]! Half of the wines on the wine list were unavailable and 3 of the 4 wines we requested, the bartender asked us, \"What kind of wine is that?\" \n\nAfter our bartender broke the cork of our 2004 Rutherford merlot, my colleagues meticulously removed the remaining slivers as best as they could but a few shards still dropped in. No cheese cloth to filter the cork. And no decanter. (No decanters at a wine bar?!? #dafuq???) Yea, I might sound wine snobbish but it's a friggin wine bar!\n\nWe dumped the first pour really hard to get the cork remnants out and enjoyed the 2004 vintage, which was surprisingly wonderful for 2004 not being a \"good year\" in Napa. We asked our bartender for a pint glass to filter out the cork in that first glass that we set aside. The bar tender looked at us with confusion and wonder at the request for a \"pint glass\" to which we responded, \"That glass that you pour a beer in.\" *lightbulb* \n\nAll in all it was a sad face experience. The look and feel of the place is awesome and if you don't give a crap about El Vino, and the depths of it's majesty, and just want some cool atmosphere that serves the juice, this is a good spot to hang. \n\nI've left the bartender's name and description anonymous because he/she was very nice and did his/her best, but I am embarrassed for the owner that that person is a representative of a wine bar. My suggestion to said owner is to have weekly wine tastings for employees so that they can become educated on what they are pouring at POUR HOUSE, to have an current list of what is available, and to have a GREAT semi-secret stash for people who come in actually knowing about wine. There are a lot of service industry folk who roam around polk street who would enthusiastically back a place like this, if it were worthy. If this place actually held expertise in the niche it fronts to claim, POUR HOUSE could be one of those places that young, trendy winos with networks of great people would have a culty kind of love for. It could be a place where both a 2 buck chuck wine lover and a 5 year veteran server from a top steakhouse can both call home, and be excited to bring their friends. It's kinda whomp whomp to see an establishment claim their lane but not rock it out. Many reviews say it isn't busy here most of the time. If that's the way the owners like it, then great. For now, I'm rudely disappointed. But I look forward to coming back and hopefully updating my review with something better to say.", "author": "Noreen J."}

We found this wine bar one night over a year ago after we had seen a movie on Van Ness.  The thing we really like about this place is it's not uptight like some wine bars.  The atmosphere is laid back and inviting and the bartenders are friendly and helpful.  You don't feel like you have to know a lot about wine (like some wine bars).  They're happy to help with suggestions.  The prices are great and they also have a great beer selection if wine isn't your thing.\n\nBack to our event - Chase and Nelson were the bartenders and they were awesome. We had between 50 and 60 people show up between 630 and 9 and I never heard anyone complain that they had to wait for their drinks.  Everyone had a great time.  When we walked in at first they were playing pretty loud rock, maybe even heavy metal.  I was surprised that heavy metal type rock would be playing at a wine bar ever... kind of a turn off. Chase was accomodating and took our requests for the music we liked for the night, which is awesome, but I can say that if I was just coming in for a drink that kind of music wouldn't make me want to stay.  \n\nThey didn't charge us to host our party in their bar which was awesome but we were a little disappointed that there were no deals whatsoever or something complimentary, like maybe something as simple as a bottle of champagne for us.  It would have been a nice gesture as we did give them a LOT of business on a Thursday night.  Also there was a calendar online that said wine was $1 off between 6-8 on Thursdays (event was April 5) and I'm pretty sure that discount wasn't passed on to our guests. http://www.sfpourhouse.com/calendar\n\nThe guy in charge of events wasn't very responsive so it was hard to plan our event.  At one point I asked for a list of food options and he never responded.  We decided to make our own arrangements and bring food in.  I got an email from him 4 days later asking about a head count.  When I told him we'd be bringing food of our own in he then told me we would have to purchase 4-5 platters in addition to the food we brought in.  We most likely would have bought platters from them but the lack of response made me feel like he didn't care so I didn't want to spend more money on food through them.  I almost felt like I was trying so hard to make the event work out, instead of the other way around.  \nI believe in constructive criticism so hopefully they'll heed these comments and change the way they handle communication for future events.", "author": "Alisa M."}

If you know me, you'd know how much I hate driving to the city. Very few things are worth it for me. The first is going to Giants games. The second is driving by the stadium and wishing the Giants were playing during the off-season. And now, there's the Pour House.\n\nThey have a good drink menu here. Because I don't know my way around good wines quite yet, I was actually looking at the menu in confusion. The bartender probably saw the dopey look on my face, so he recommended the Red Wine Flight. 4 generous pours of their best red wines. Needless to say, they were all very good.\n\nThey've also got beer here, which is an instant plus for me. Unfortunately, they were sold out of the Dogfish Head when we visited. My friend and I were extremely sad. But the Duvel was a decent substitute.\n\nOne other thing, if you ever get hungry, you can actually order food from the Thai restaurant up the street (Chai-Yo, I think it was called). And they actually BRING IT TO YOU while you're at the bar! Again, win-win for both businesses. \n\nThe bartender for the night (Nelson) was a very awesome dude. Giving good recommendations and always willing to help out his customers. A winning attitude for any business, in my opinion.\n\nOverall, I WILL come back again (once I find some friends who know how to appreciate wine). Great service, good drinks, even better buzz.

It conveniently opens at 4pm, the time I think happy hour should start. The Pour House used to be SNOB (Sonoma, Napa or Beyond) but the subsequently changed the name and the vibe. SNOB was a bit pretentious and the service was about as rude as a NYC cab driver at 2am. I went twice before the name change and both times I felt as if I was inconveniencing the bartender by gracing her with my presence. But this has all changed, thankfully. \n\nThe Pour House has turned into a fabulous low-key semi-hipster place. The new atmosphere is relaxed, there is plenty of seating with a long wood bar (with purse hooks), 3 overstuffed couches up front and a splattering of tables in the dark, romantic back of the bar. Unless you know the majority of the people sitting on the couches, it can be a bit awkward to sit there. My friend and I started out on the couches but later moved after a group of 5 sat down. I really felt I was invading someone's living room couch. So if you have space issues or don't like people listening to your conversation then pick a seat at the bar or one of the tables in the back.\n\nThe bar offers 40 different premium wines and 25 microbrews (10 on tap). The bartender on duty was a very nice young man who unfortunately went to UCONN (I didn't hold it against him, we still tipped). My only complaint is that the cheese plate is horrible. First off you have two cheese choices, Jarlsberg and an unidentified crumbled goat cheese. The two cheeses come with massive wheat crackers that do nothing to compliment the cheese. The best part was the dish of salty olives. If I wasn't so starved, I would have told him he could keep it after my first glance. Another food option is to order from one of the restaurants on Polk Street and have them deliver right to you at the bar.", "author": "Alice S."}

Do they think they are in San Diego?  The door is always open.  Always.  Even on nights when it is 40 degrees.  The velvet curtains around the door does very little to keep the wind out.  There is small electric heater (think of something you would find underneath an office desk) in the front near the couches.  It does nothing to keep the place warm.  The bar is half empty and is not going to warm up by body temperature.  \n\nHere is an idea, when it gets really cold outside, why don't they act like reasonable  SF'ers and shut the door.  \n\nThe place isn't located in the greatest neighborhood.  Polk street after a certain hour, becomes sketchy with sketchy characters.  Every time I have been at The Pour House, one of these characters always wanders in and accosts me.  Fortunately, the bartenders are very aware of this problem and each and every time escort them out.  \n\nIs it The Pour House's fault that these derelicts wander into their establishment?

One of their craft beer kegs, Sierra Nevada Torpedo, was very old.  There was no hop aroma left in that beer, very little hop flavor.

Then he said \"well can't you see this is not a restaurant, you cant eat your food here.\" I said \"not a problem we are on out way out the door anyway.\" Then with a cynical tone he gestured toward the down and \"well then goodbye\". I was shocked, I said to him \" there is no reason to be rude about it.\" He replied \" I'm trying not to be, now leave.\"\n\nThere is just simply no reason to be rude to someone who has in no way wronged you.

You know the drill, a long list of wines, and there are several opportunities to find what you like.

The menu listed two cabernet sauvignons, and a Syrah I can get elsewhere, if I have to, as it's not a favorite.  What's the point?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-17", "description": "Usually this is a great, low-key, and easy going wine bar. One star for the ambiance, and one star for the quality of the wine. However, this time we went there on a Thursday evening, and it seemed great to begin, as there were only 5 other people there, so we felt like we practically had the entire place to ourselves. There was a female bartender, whom was heavily flirting with two guys at the bar, just 4 bar stools away from us. Usually I am cool with such things, so we waited patiently for them, hoping she might find a way to politely excuse herself to take our order. I waited until she served them, and after waiting another 5 minutes, I politely raised my hand, and gestured with a friendly smile that we were ready, she looked me in the eye, and turned away to continue her conversation, as if we were lepers. After several more minutes, I tried to politely catch her attention in the same manner, again, not even an acknowledgement of our existence,  although she looked me directly in the eye. By now about 15 minutes have gone by, and a couple walks in, and sits at a table against the wall across from the bar, and they sit patiently waiting as well, and the bartender continues her flirtatious conversation. The couple gets up, and walks up, and has to interrupt the conversation to get the bartender's attentions, and in retrospect I probably should have done the same, but I try to take the polite, and gentle approach, especially when the bar is so slow. The bartender reacts to the couple with a whole lot of attitude, and a very rude look, but at least they seem to have managed to get the bartender to start doing her job, and they receive their wine. Silly us, we thought that she might realize at that point that there were other people, like us, still sitting there at the bar, very close to her, whom were still waiting to order, and we even tried to flag her down, as she served the couple, but no, she jumped right back to flirting with the guys. After 20 minutes, I was waiving my hands in the air, and leaning over, so I was behind the guys, and there would be no way that she could continue to ignore us, and pay attention to the guys, without being distracted by me. After she let out a hipster huff of frustration, she finally came over to us, and instead of making any effort to reconcile the obvious error on her part, the first thing she said to us, is in a snotty tone is, \"there are a lot of other people I have to serve here, who ordered before you, want do you want?\" Wow! So, even though the other 5 people already had their drinks, and were not asking her for anything, and the couple that came later and asked her for two glasses of wine, were a lot of people to be occupied by? I can understand when a bar is busy, as I grew up working in family hotels, and restaurants, so I have a great deal of empathy for anyone in this industry, but the fact that she blatantly ignored us, and gave us, and others, so much negative attitude, and clearly ignored her job in favor of trying to hook up with someone, is simply inexcusable. It was slow enough, that she could have very quickly taken our orders, and gone back to hitting on the guys, and we would have been cool with it. We would have been able to relax with our wine and dive into our own conversation. Instead, we received horrible service, a BS excuse with a lot of entitled negative attitude, and very small pours in retaliation for politely asking to order, and I know this, because we have been served wine there many times before.", "author": "J H."}

It was close to our hotel, the bartendar was very nice, helpful & knowledgeable about the wines. We purchased one flight of red & a flight of white for a whopping $24!!! And I must tell you the pours were GENEROUS!! My only tiny gripe is that there were no cheese plates available, we got there around 10:30pm.. He was only able to offer us some bar nuts, but sister is allergic, so that was a bust!  We closed the place down at midnight, then headed over Tommy's Joynt for some late-late nite grub... I will definitely be back, would love to bring my hubby...", "author": "Karrie K."}

I initially went there because I bought a groupon online but I've been back a few times afterwards too. I like the rustic look of the place, I love the bartenders/wine servers and I love the selection of wine and beer.  \nThe futon is the best place to sit. It's cozy and it's right by the window so you can people watch.  \nThe best part about the place is that they let you order food from a nearby Thai restaurant. They deliver :)\nThis place is definitely one of my favs.", "author": "Swati K."}

The ambiance is very cozy, unpretentious, and the bar tender was really friendly. The flight of red wine was a steal at $12 and they were very generous with their servings. I had to have my friend drink some of mine! Overall it's a really great place to hang out and talk, casual but still nice, good music, and overall a great time. The service was wonderful and it showed that he really cared about the customers.", "author": "Misty M."}

The music wasn't too loud (like so many bars in the city) and we were able to enjoy a nice conversation. The beer and wine selection was good- maybe not as good as other wine and beer bars in  the city (not enough beer on tap) but it was decent.\n\nWhat I really took note of was how friendly and personable the bartender was. It is so nice to get such great service with a smile.", "author": "Jessica B."}

Excellent service, great ambiance and you can get food from the surrounding area and bring it in.  Great selection of wine, although I had the sparkling wine which was great and then I switched to an awesome beer...trying to recall what is was (similar to a Hefeweizen). Again great service, no overally crowded!  I will come back and bring my pals!", "author": "Ashley L."}

Tip: if your appetite needs more than cheese/dips you can call-in Thai food from  next door. We dialed Chaya-yo from the landline (they know the digits) and they brought all the linens/cutlery/food straight from the kitchen. Delicious wine, spicy Thai, and a cute bartender to boot. We'll def be back!", "author": "Darya P."}

They didn't have the sparkling rose so we ordered the French brut. The bartender then found some rose that was open and gave us a free glass. My husband was also happy as they had a great selection of beer and huge beer glasses. I also left a bag of british food (marmite, teabags, etc from the british shop down the road) there and the bartender was very friendly when I called and has put it aside for me to collect.", "author": "Molly W."}

The location was easy for people coming from East Bay and there was parking across the street. The staff made it easy to plan the event and were very helpful during event. We had about 50 people at the party and didn't feel crowed even with another party in front. We brought in our own food and the alcohol worked out great. Everyone had a great time. I would do another event at The Pour house! Thanks again.", "author": "C T."}

They had a lot of great options and the ambiance was cool and comfortable. The music was a little loud for my taste because I could barely hear what my date was saying, but at least it was cool music! I liked the lounge couches in the front where you could lay and cuddle! I'll definitely cone back here.", "author": "Marian G."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-15", "description": "This just became my new favorite wine bar!  Their selections of wines are incredible and it is fabulous that they are willing to let you try a wine before you order it.  Ryan, the bartender, was the only one working last night but I never felt neglected.  He was always right there when my glass was empty to offer me another glass.  This is a great place to go with friends and especially friends who are not necessarily wine people but prefer beer as they have a bunch of beers on tap and in a bottle.  The other great thing is you can bring food into the bar from local restaurants, I highly recommend the shawarma from Frisco's Pizza and Shawarma.   Pour house does have some cheese plates available to order but I got the kalamata olives, which were absolutely delicious!  Ended up spending over 4 hours there and never felt rushed.  Total bill with four people, more than a dozen glasses of wine and more than 10 beers came to $91, pretty dang impressive!  Will most certainly be returning!", "author": "Adrienne B."}
