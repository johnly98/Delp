Often, I'll go to places that post pictures of their elaborate art only for them to do very basic or boring designs when I actually order coffee. I was not disappointed here. Of the five different lattes we ordered, each had it's own unique flair, and each individual one was more interesting than any I had seen anywhere else. I got the Nutella latte and it tasted like if you mix an espresso shot into your hot chocolate. It was very good because I like hot chocolate but definitely not for the coffee purist. \n\nThe shop: I liked the decor, but it was a bit dimly lit. It was a nice place to meet up with friends and take pictures of coffee, especially with the natural lighting and more blueish hues.

It is definitely a sweeter latte; the girl helping me offered to make it less sweet, which I think most people would appreciate.\n\nI had actually come with the intention of doing work here, without realizing that they restrict laptop use at some front tables.

The pieces of lavender sprinkled on top were the only source of flavor in this jasmine lavender tea latte. It was so unpleasant that I had to take it back to the counter and they were nice enough to take the drink back and refund me. I didn't get another drink because I really didn't want to be disappointed yet again. \n\nThere also aren't enough tables to fill the large back room, and people were awkwardly crowding the packed front room because there's not enough seating to sit down and wait for your order.\n\nFYI the prices online don't reflect in-store prices, in case you're referencing their online menu like I was while making my way over.\n\nI used to consider Home one of the best coffee shops in the city but this opinion has definitely changed.

The true quality of the coffee is definitely masked by the sugariness of the drink, but I like my lattes more on the sweet side so it didn't bother me much.

The latte art and little cookie crisps were cute, but it was bitter and didn't taste anything like cookie butter, like I had hoped it would. However I did enjoy the birthday cake latte! It was beautifully designed, and super sweet and flavorful, as the cashier had explained. I also had a taste of the coconut vanilla latte, and even though I don't like coconut too much, it was super yummy! Definitely recommend the birthday cake for those with a sweet tooth, and the coconut vanilla for those who want a flavorful latte but not too sweet. \n\nFrom the pastry case, we ordered the mochi muffin and Thai tea custard cake, which are from Third Culture Bakery. It was so yummy!! I loved how subtle the sweetness was and how chewy it was from the mochi. We also had the milk & cereal toast. The condensed milk was the perfect amount.

Specifically, I was drawn to the birthday latte which is beautifully decorated on top with a kaleidoscope of rainbow colors and sprinkles to match.  Like most things, you should not judge a book by its cover and this is definitely an example.  Even when ordering the barista delightfully warned that the drink was more like a hazel nut flavor.  In someways a let down, the drink was still solid and its beauty more than made up for its just okay flavor.\n\nA hipster hangout would not be complete with a menu of avocado toast options.  Because I was craving something with a little Asian flair, I ordered the Seoul Much Avo which was their avocado toast with pieces of kimchi, pine nuts, and sesame seeds.  The kimchi was a welcome kick of spiciness to give the avocado on toast.  Though if I were to go back, I would probably have their flight which gives an offering of three of their avocado toasts.\n\nWhile there are several tables with outlets for studying, the cafe does have several tables reserved for people who want to socialize and catch up.  Their aim to try to promote social interaction is a noble one and definitely fits with the atmosphere and vibe they promote.\n\nThe staff was pretty helpful and attentive.

Decor here was sparse and packages lined the opposite wall... The freezer and exposed supplies felt sloppy. Kinda takes you out of the ~cute cafe~ atmosphere, which is like, what I'm paying for LOL. I'm guessing they're still working on it.\n\nCOOKIE MONSTER LATTE: Not too sweet, not too bitter, wish there were more cookies lol. Hints of cookie butter that are just sweet enough to balance out the espresso. They can sub out their whole milk for a bit extra if you're lactose-intolerant. Still a delicious latte that kicked up my energy.\n\nSEOUL MUCH AVO: Avocado and kimchi together is surprisingly delicious. I like that the creamy, subtle avocado spread balances out the fiery kimchi (not sure if this is ~authentic~ kimchi though lol). The pine nuts add a great crunch!

This coffee place promises happiness. You'll find coffee in a different kind of variations: with Nutella, lavender, red velvet, birthday cake, etc. \n\nEach creative coffee is a hand-crafted piece of art.\nI felt in love with the rainbow-colored birthday cake latte ($5). The taste is vanilla & hazelnut. Also the Nutella latte ($5)conquered my heart. Yes, you read correctly: NUTELLA Latte! It absolutely tastes like Nutella and you can find some Nutella at the bottom of your cup.\n\nAfter having tried all these different creations, I didn't want to leave without getting the Rose Latte. No regrets at all. Turned out this one was my favorite flavor. Not too sweet, not too intense. Just perfect.

I think they must have either been getting a lot of complaints or people saying the lattes are too sweet, because the cashier warned me about the sweetness and asked me if I wanted to adjust it. I'm not too big of a fan of sweet coffee, so I adjusted both to low sweetness. \n\nWhen I got my birthday latte, I was surprised by how sweet it still was, and lacked coffee taste. On coffee standards, I wasn't too big of a fan. I definitely didn't feel like I got my caffeine fix. The lavender latte was better, but still pretty sweet and the tea itself wasn't that strong. The only thing that made it taste strongly of lavender were the lavender seeds on top. The food, I was more of a fan of. I have had the Mochi muffin before, so I really liked that. The toast was very simple, but tasty, but much too sweet with my coffee. Maybe I will go with a black coffee next time with the toast.

The other people I came with got a regular black iced coffee and a hot Nutella Latte.  Everyone was pretty happy with their drinks.  \n\nThey do some pretty impressive drinks with beautiful presentation here.  Their hot drinks are much more fancier looking than their cold drinks.  Their most popular is the colorful Birthday Cake Latte.  I will need to come back and try that.  Their drinks run from $3 to $5.  It's an additional $.50 for almond or soy milk.  They also have some brunch items and pastries.  \n\nThe inside of this place is cute and modern looking.  It has an open and casual feel.  There is another place to have brunch or hang out in the back.  The girl at the register was very nice.  Although it was pretty busy we got our drinks soon after we ordered.  I would definitely recommend and cannot wait to go back.", "author": "Cat N."}

My flight was supposed to be yesterday evening and it ended up getting cancelled. I got to spend an extra day in sf and come check this place out which ended being walking distance from where I was already so didn't even have to pay for an Uber...like I said, destiny. I got the almond butter toast. It was sweet but not too sweet. Also the fruits on top were freshly cut and the whole thing was just really good esp if you like almond butter. I also got the birthday cake latte. It was BEAUTIFUL first of all. It was really sweet but I'm into that so I loved it.

However, the two times I've been there on my last trip it was always packed. I like the fact that they put signs on a few tables saying \"no laptops here\". It really helps because I've sat at those tables twice. If it weren't for those signs, I can see there being no tables available at all. And I can see why! I can totally spend hours here as well as the vibe is so chill with good music, friendly staff and nice decor.\n\nSo the coffee... I tried the holy cow, birthday cake and chocolate mint latte. They were ALL so good, I would order all of them again. For the instagrammer, birthday cake is a must. I've seen that the cookie monster is another good one for pictures.\n\nFood: I've had the Br-avo and the a bb's of toast. Again, both were so good!

Would order again! \n* Matcha Strawberry Toast - 2 stars: Condensed milk overwhelmed the thin toast. Way too sweet, barely tasted the matcha. \n* Coconut Latte - 1 star: Tasted like Flavia coffee (very artificial).\n* Condensed Milk Latte - 3.5 stars: Tasty but nothing special \n* Cookie Butter Latte - 4 stars: I generally dislike sweet drinks but this was beautiful AND delicious! I liked how distinct the Speculoos flavor was and downed the entire thing. \n\nOverall, I like how spacious and modern this new location is.

Also, their music is always on point: from '00s MTV \"TRL\" music (e.g. NSYNC, BSB) to '80s soft rock to '70s \"solid gold\" to '90s R&B, they are bumpin' all the nostalgic jams (THANK YOU).

True to their name, though, Home is fantastic at making their customers feel like they're truly at home on Clement.\n\nSweet, rich drinks are the name of the game here. While most quasi-independent coffee places pride themselves on their roasts, the people here are promoting their unique takes on lattes.

The taste of blended cookie doesn't hit you full-force until the dregs of the cup, although its milkyness and thickness is present throughout. I also tasted my friend's rose latte, which seems to be off-menu but was confirmed by baristas to still be served here. It certainly is ultra sweet, with the flower taking precedence over the beans. I'd venture to say that it was even sweeter than my cookie butter latte. Both drinks came adorned with their namesakes: a smattering of Cookie Crisp cereal on mine and a sprinkle of dried rose petals for hers. \n\nHer boyfriend first went for a lavender latte (again with the dried flower buds), then got a hazelnut latte with an extra shot for the road. We thought to ask for latte art on the to-go, since we'd all gotten similar tulips on our drinks. Lo and behold, the one we'd requested art on had a teddy bear and laurel. If they're not busy, I highly recommend asking just to see what other tricks they have up their sleeves. \n\nSome of their tables have a laptop ban, but fret not, workaholics. There are plenty of marble tabletops that allow for both solo and communal working. The bathroom is also easily accessible and clean. I'm hopeful they'll open one closer to Daly City or a BART station someday, but having this new one in the Richmond District is fine by me.", "author": "Gwen W."}

I went straight to the wonderful yelp community to look for a good coffee spot for studying and I found Home! \n\nI'm not one for sweet lattes so unfortunately I didn't get the amazing instagramable Birthday Cake latte. Instead, I ordered my go-to cortado ($4.07) and it was great! The espresso shined through the steamed milk and the aftertaste was so smooth and not bitter at all. Home also offers a wide range of other beverages like iced teas, hot chocolate and even orange juice, so if coffee isn't your thing you'll still find something to enjoy! Their avocado toast also seems to be decently priced (ranges from $6-$7.75). I was not hungry enough to order a toast but based on the quality of their drinks, I'm certain the toasts are amazing too. \n\nThe coffee shop itself is quite large, with a lot of tables but unfortunately it was very crowded on the day I went. I managed to find a spot at one of the bar tops and it was fine for a short study session. There seem to be quite a few outlets so I'd say, if you find a table, this place would be great for a long study/work session! They also have free WiFi! \n\nWhat really stood out to me was the friendly service. I mentioned to the cashier that I'm not one for sweet drinks and he seemed so excited to make my cortado! I also told him I was from out of town and he so warmly welcomed me to the establishment and thanked me for trying the shop out. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the aesthetic and energy of this coffee shop!

First thing I noticed was how big the cups were. Not sure if it was just me, but I definitely felt like the drink was larger than what I was typically used to.

The cashier was so sweet and warned us about the latte saying that some may find it too sweet so if we wanted we could go half way on the sweetness. I was born a sweet tooth so I ordered it standard. My friend isn't big on sweet so she went half way. We both agreed that it was bomb and the avocado toast was delicious! I wish they'd open up a Home OC!", "author": "Widad D."}

It's walking distance from my parent's house, which means once I've run out of productivity, I walk myself home for lunch or dinner. Haha. This really is a great location with it being on a nice, quiet street. It's less packed than the Noriega location (for now) so it's much easier grabbing a table, except for Monday mornings... but no big deal. The quality of their drinks here is the same as Noriega; I appreciate the consistency! My go-to drink at Home is cafe au lait. Occasionally, I'll have the matcha or chai latte. I felt adventurous today and tried the red velvet latte. I don't know what they use to make it, but it was so good! I like that it's not too sweet. The lattes come in this giant bowl-like cup. As I drank my latte today, I laughed and myself and thought, \"it's like I'm drinking soup!\" Haha\n\nOne thing this location has that the Noriega location doesn't is the back patio. There's no furniture out there, but it's a great place to have a quiet phone call when it's too loud inside or to let your kids run around freely. I've seen quite a few babies and puppies enjoy that outside space. \n\nLike the Noriega location, the baristas here are very friendly and welcoming. They really try to get to know the customer. \n\nI thought I'd explore more coffee shops since I moved back to SF. But quite honestly, Home was the 2nd coffee shop I tried and both locations have kept me from going anywhere else!

Finally got a chance to visit one of their locations and catch up with old friends this weekend. We arrived around 2pm on a busy Saturday afternoon and were unable to find an open table. The cashier noticed we were waiting around and told us to check the back room, but those were occupied as well. We decided to walk around Geary and after 10 minutes or so, we were able to find a table near the entrance. (Also, the marble tables with the succulents are really nice and aesthetically appealing.) \n\nI ordered the birthday cake latte and my friend got the cookie monster latte. Both were beautifully made, as pictured. I was afraid the birthday cake latte would be too sweet, but it turned out great & suited my taste.

Their drink selection is extensive and includes all the standard coffee drinks (americano, cappuccino, cold brew, etc.), several flavored latte options (lavender, hazelnut, red velvet, birthday cake, etc), teas, and matcha. Home gets an extra nod for serving matcha as it is not a widely served drink amongst coffee shops. Drink prices are a bit above average ($4-6). \n\nQuite appropriately, I visited Home with my family. We each ordered a drink and two toasts to share. We all agreed our drinks were delicious, and I was especially pleased with my matcha iced latte - the perfect balance of subtle sweetness and earthiness. I was a bit disappointed they do not serve low fat milk, but I do appreciate they have other options aside from whole milk, including almond and soy. The avocado toasts we ordered were good, but not special by any means. Note, the toast is a thick brioche toast, which makes for a good vehicle for all the toppings. For those of you familiar with \"brick toast\" - they also offer a similar option. They serve both savory and sweet toasts. \n\nSeating is communal, and this seems to be both a popular spot to study and hang out. Their back room could use a few more tables, as the space is not being utilized to the fullest. Their atmosphere would greatly improve by utilizing this space to accommodate their customers, and removing the awkward boxes in the same space. Service is OK. \n\nNeedless to say, home is where you make it...and I'm not sold this is it.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Their special creations are super good and always fun--nothing your normal coffee shop will have. Typically, with a place like this, you assume they're popular just because their drinks look fun, but don't necessarily taste good. But I can assure you they taste as good as they look! My only complaint is that they are quite expensive, but then again, they put in a lot of effort so it's well deserved. Heads up though, their alternative milk prices are around $1 extra. I've tried several of their creations, and so far my favorites are the coconut vanilla latte and the rose latte. Their rainbow latte is pretty good- I recommend getting it once just to say you've got it-but the real winners lie in the less fancy drinks.

The caffeine is a bit strong for my preference but it definitely helps if you need an extra kick in energy. \n\nService: 5/5!\nThe staff here is so sweet. The last couple times I've been here, there's been a girl working named Judy that helps me at the register when I'm inching to try something new, whether it'd be a drink or a snack.

She even noticed I had my backpack and asked if I was here to do work and wanted the wifi info\n* The latte was presented beautifully and tasted great\n* Seating is limited but comfortable with outlets! I do wish there was more seating because it seems like there is more space in a room past the front area..which brings me to my next point\n* There are so many workers at once and in their down time they can be having a little too much fun talking and if I didn't have my ear phones on it might be hard to do work so I would prefer to snatch a seat closer to the back next time \n* Another con that they can't really control is after school hours there's a good amount of young high schoolers running around the place so I will most likely avoid those hours next time", "author": "Sarah W."}

I've been following Home SF on Instagram for a month and couldn't wait to try a specialty latte! Visiting from LA, I wanted to make sure I tried this place before returning home. My expectations weren't too high as I figured it would be a cute, hipster place with bitter, somewhat watered down coffee. Boy, was I wrong! I was surprised we didn't have to wait in line at all. Cashier and barista were very friendly and asked if it was our first time at Home and where we were visiting from. After asking for several recommendations, I decided on the Birthday Cake latte and my boyfriend chose the Cookie Monster latte. Both lattes came out in a timely fashion and were hot. So glad they were served in real mugs instead of paper like so many mainstream coffee shops nowadays. The latte art was unlike anything I'd ever seen before, and I was thoroughly impressed. Both lattes were surprisingly delicious and not too sweet. I could taste the coffee and there was a definite hint of vanilla in the birthday cake latte. Would highly recommend the already packaged OG graham crackers to dip in your coffee as they are not too sweet and add a great crunch to your afternoon cup of joe. We found a place to sit without having to wait, and I snapped a bunch of pics of my coffee to make my friends jealous. And it worked! Hands down, the best latte art I've ever seen and Home SF executed perfectly. I will be returning and would recommend to anyone who's looking for a cute AND delicious coffee shop!", "author": "Katie R."}

Also, I couldn't tell if the espresso shots were expired or not in both of the drinks. The drinks came out pretty slow because there's essentially only one machine and only one barista making drinks. \n\nI will be back to try other drinks though. Home has some pretty creative ones.

Fav cafe in the city!!\n\nThe last time I was here, when I ordered, the barista asked for my name. I said, \"Kimi,\" and she started to spell it \"K-I-M-M-Y.\" Suddenly, another barista came to the counter and said, \"Hey, Kimi and I know each other! She spells it K-I-M-I!!\" This was only my 3rd time here, and each visit was spaced out with lots of time in between, yet she remembered me?? Home lives up to its name!!\n\nWhat I've tried:\n- Birthday cake latte: This is a rainbow vanilla latte. It doesn't really taste like birthday cake. The baristas make sure you know that before you make your final decision (they ask if you've ever had it, and if you say no, they proceed to explain what it actually is so you aren't disappointed upon tasting). THE PRESENTATION IS ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL. If you have a foodstagram, this is one thing that you absolutely NEEEEEEED on there. Do it for the aesthetic. DO IT!! For a latte, it was pretty good. Nice and smooth\n- Rose latte: I'm a sucker for anything rose. This was good, but I think the rose flavor could've been a little stronger. They top it with rose petals that you can eat. It's a nice touch!\n- Godzilla: This is sparkling water with a shot of matcha. The barista warned me upon ordering, saying that it might be too bitter and that I might want some sweetener in it. My motto: The more bitter, the better. I really enjoyed this drink!! The matcha flavor was STRONG, and I love sparkling water, so I thought it was amazing. This might not be for everyone though\n- Matcha love toast: Yummy!! They use organic matcha and condensed milk on this toast and top it off with strawberries. I think it was just a little too sweet for me...nonetheless, I enjoyed it\n\nThere are quite a few tables inside, as well as wifi and power outlets. The first time I came, you were allowed to use laptops at all the tables, but during my next visit, I saw that a few of the tables had saying saying no laptops allowed. It gets crowded as the day goes on, but if you come early enough, you'll be able to get a table. I also remember seeing a sign saying something about them working on getting a permit for outdoor seating\n\nBottom line: I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS PLACE!! I'll definitely be back. There's so much I want to try on the menu!! San Francisco does not disappoint when it comes to cutesy hipster coffee shops. DO IT FOR THE INSTA", "author": "Kithumini J."}

The rose latte was perfect, it was sweet but not overpowering and tasted exactly of smelling a rose. It was also presented beautifully and i definitely recommend. The birthday cake latte was also very good and was absolutely stunning! It tasted of vanilla flavor and was truly amazing. Lastly, the bravo toast was really good and I loved the beets on top as it really added to the whole toast! I definitely recommend this place and it is definitely worth coming here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-10-05", "description": "After much Instagram hype over the rainbow and cookie butter latte I've heard so much about, I had to try this location out! I've been to their other location and tried the rainbow latte but it didn't really have the cake flavor I was hoping for. If any, it was mostly for the aesthetic. I liked the latte art and sprinkles they had on top but there was no flavor. However, I was willing to give the new location a chance. \n\nI'm glad this location is closer to my school. It was kinda hard to find because it was tucked behind a few other shops. The only thing that was recognizable from the outside was the sign that directed coffee-lovers and Instagram foodies from all around. Once I got inside, it was very crowded at around 3 pm on a weekday. It was spacious, with a bunch of tables lining the left side and the espresso bar on the right. There is also seating available in the back room. My friend and I had to wait for someone to leave to hunt for a table to sit at. There's just a bunch of people working on their laptops or students studying. \n\nThe baristas were very welcoming and asked if my friend and I had any questions. There were a handful of specialty lattes and a bunch of toasts that I looked over, but I settled on the Cookie Monster, or their cookie butter latte. I've tried the one at Rise & Grind and it's my absolute favorite!! The baristas there always put a hefty amount of cookie butter, just the way I like it. I like my lattes to be flavorful, so I wanted to try both to see how the two compared. \n\nWhen I received my drink, it had a cute little teddy bear on it and came with a wooden spoon. However, the handle-less cup was smaller than I would have liked, especially for a drink so pricey ($5.25). The cookie butter latte comes adorned with some cookie crisp pieces. Much to my horror, the pieces were stale when I tried them. I tried a sip of the latte and it didn't really taste much like cookie butter- I also found out it was lukewarm! It just tasted like a latte with a hint of cookie butter, as if it was an afterthought. The cookie butter flavor was so subtle. I tried stirring it up in the hopes that there could be some more sitting at the bottom but it just was not as flavorful as I like! \n\nI was really looking forward this place, but it turned out very underwhelming. They make up for their lack in flavor with Instagram worthy latte art. Maybe I'll give this place another chance once they step up their cup design and flavor profiles.", "author": "Anne P."}

Much more seating in the Outer Richmond as well. Such a huge selection of drinks and toast and other baked goodies. Diverse crowd and most were on their laptops hanging out.  There's metered parking out front and it took no time to find a space. We tried the Lavender Latte which had the perfect amount of lavender and sweetness and such a pretty presentation, also ordered the Birthday Cake which is essentially a Hazelnut Latte but the coolest part of that drink is how pretty they make it with the colorful design on top, IG dreams are made of these.... I also ordered the Say Cheese, a corny-cheesy-bacony toast. I wouldn't say I loved the saltiness of those ingredients and will be choosing a different selection the next time I go but it was okay.  Definitely try the toast with condensed milk, so yummy! The service was amazing, they were so friendly and super willing to answer questions.

The hexagonal white tiling matches the marble table tops that line the side of the cafe.  Each table carries adorably small succulents as centerpieces.  I love the color palate of the cafe--a combination of white, black, light browns, and blues.  The cafe strikes an awesome balance of feeling modern and chic, but also very homey.\n\nI frequent coffee shops around the city looking for different places to knock out some work.  Home cafe has many different outlets that line the walls and steady wifi.  I'm here on an early Friday morning and the place isn't packed so finding a table and waiting to order took zero time. I ordered the birthday cafe latte--super hype!  Just looking at the drink makes people feel giddy inside.  The taste is really delightful as well -- full, warm, with hints of vanilla -- damnit it feels like home!\n\nOn top of the homey feels, the chic look, the natural light, ideal work conditions, and tasteful drinks -- this guy up front rocking the man bun is easily one of the friendliest guys I've ever met.  This guy f**ks.  Smooth voice, great smile, he dropped the \"welcome home\" line and it was the cafe equivalent of the song drop from a Calvin Harris summer banger.  He noticed I had a laptop bag and without skipping a beat asked if I needed the wifi password.

It was another coffeeshop selling $9 dollar avocado toast. \nI felt that my toast was lacking in taste, it had a very small amount of avocado on it with a whole bag of arugula and three cherry tomatoes. I had to take most of the arugula off because it was so bitter. \nI also ordered a cappuccino, it was ok. Nothing special, the best part of my drink was the design on top. While I got a leaf my friend got a cool looking bear. Out of everything that was the best part. \nI don't think I would return its just way over priced for what you get.", "author": "Veronica V."}

The service is great but there were two flaws besides no fried eggs that I just can't give them 4 star compare to their Noriega location. First is their toast. It's just regular thin toast you can get at any store and make it at home yourself.  Their other location is a nice soft thick bread that u can add fried egg on any yummy toast. Yes the Noriega location doesn't have avocado toast like when they first open vs this new place. The second flaw was their internet. I'm very positive it wasn't our two diff version iPad and my iPhone that will not connect to the internet. When we told one of the workers, she tried it and said to restart it which we did and no results. She even said other people is connecting to it. Well cmon now, they might have their own wifi or maybe too many people on wifi . Their other location also isn't very good but at lease it does connect even though it's slow. I would suggest this place to get better bandwidth internet and same brioche soft yummy thick toast like their Noriega location plus fried eggs of course. I'll give this another try when they update those two flaw. Oh yeah, I do love their many flavor drinks.", "author": "Christy V."}

Second, there are actually places to sit - plenty of them, including a large, open space in the back. Third, the menu is super tempting, with all kinds of unique varieties of coffee and tea drinks, as well as an entire column dedicated to toast. Toast? Yes, toast. The avo-cuddle was even more delightful to eat than it was to say, with a to-die-for meld of butter or some type of oil, avocado, arugula, cherry tomatoes and crushed red pepper. MMMMMMMMMMMM.\n\nHome is a fabulous addition to this corridor. And please note, if you're wondering, that this place is not a replacement for the fabulous, nearby Angelina's.

I initially went to the sunset location, but decided to come to the other one because I really wanted to try the avocado toast sampler. The sampler was delicious, and at $9 not too expensive (considering it's not just avocado). The matcha toast was sweet but not overwhelming. My brother got the cereal toast which he seemed to enjoy. The lavender latte was great, not too sweet but with a distinct lavender flavor. I also tried my brothers bday cake latte, and as with the lavender latte it wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.

I broke down in tears mid order and the staff could not have been sweeter and more patient with me. When I pulled out my wallet to pay, James refused to let me and told me everything was on the house. I even told him that I didn't have any cash to tip cuz I was planning to pay with a card and he told me not worry about it and that it was the least he could do after everything I'd been through and to just sit down and they would take good care of me. I was sooo touched. They didn't have to do that for me. Not only was everything amazing and delicious, I truly felt like I was being taken care of as if I was home with family. Their sign out front reads: \n\n\"Welcome home!! coffee, tea, toasts and love\" \n\nThey definitely have the love part down. They provided a much needed bright and shining warm break in an otherwise dark and terrible cold time for me and I will be coming back every chance I get!

I'm very indecisive and the workers offered to recommend things and were very kind. My friend and I got the affogato, organic matcha latte, matcha love toast, and the abbs toast. The affogato was alright and it wasn't that strong. The matcha latte took a while to make but it was really cute! There was latte art on it of a peacock and I immediately understood why it took awhile. The art was so amazing and it tasted great! Not too sweet, but not too bitter! The cashier asks questions to make the drink accustomed to you by asking for the sweetness and what sugars you would like. I thought that was very nice of them and I got regular sweetness. It is more on the herbal side but I really enjoyed it. The matcha love toast was super good! The strawberries were sweet and he matcha flavor was great! I definitely would get it again. The abbs toast was pretty filling because of the almond butter and it was good as well. The workers were kind to ask if cinnamon was okay on it. I love how kind the workers are and the aesthetics!!

The furniture is nice, the interior is nice, everything is new, internet works. But you guys did many things in a half assed way and did not think everything through.\n-the way you guys arranged seats is not good. You have a small table and everyone back to the wall facing the counter. All those seats on the other side of the table are wasted. You should add a second row of tables to maximize space\nExample: I was at your cafe and there were two women with babies in strollers. They waited and waited by the window for some time and no seats freed up. They had to leave and eat their sandwich outside standing up. You see something like that please help accommodate them. Keep some extra chairs and offer them to people when you are full since you seem to be filled up.\n-almost everybody takes up a seat and sits there for hours with their computer. Older people or random people want to stop and sit for a few minutes. That's why you should also keep extra chairs that you can offer people. It does not cost anything but helps everyone.\n-the coffee is much more expensive than any mainstream coffee chain yet it doesn't actually taste better or anything. Small cup for $2.75? I understand things are expensive but at least make this coffee taste different or make it much stronger. Maybe brew fresher coffee and put more grounds in?\n-the room looks great but since you guys have hard floor and hard walls. When you have at least half of the room filled up the noise becomes very loud and resonates. You should add padding to walls or put paintings and plants up so they absorb the sound. It is extremely difficult to read or study when the sound is so loud.\n\nSorry to say the above complaints. I just want to help.", "author": "Monkey C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-10-23", "description": "Is there anywhere as cute as this cafe??? If there is I would love to find out. I've looked in NY, SF, Tokyo, other major cities - Home is the best bar none (even beats out Daikanyama Tsutaya for me in Tokyo, bc of the menu). I just wish this weren't so far from the city center but I've taken 40-minute Ubers to get here before and work for a few hours, and it was well worth it. Faves are the birthday cake latte, lavender latte, London Fog - with a million other intriguing menu items to still try. If I ever move to SF I would seriously consider living in this area FOR Home Cafe (OK, and the delicious Vietnamese/Chinese food in the area). I'm currently sitting in a cafe that is not Home and regretting this choice. There's really nowhere like Home.", "author": "Cookie M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-14", "description": "Since moving to San Francisco, I was really looking forward to finding an awesome go to coffee spot. I came across Home cafe and saw their awesome reviews and beautiful drinks. I couldn't wait to try it! I was just in yesterday and decided to order the birthday cake latte as well as the let's avo-cuddle toast. The latte was beautifully made and was delicious! The avocado toast however, could barely pass as avocado toast, it had little to no avocado and was just topped with a ton of arugula to hide the fact. I was very disappointed in the toast. The drinks however are amazing!", "author": "Karen E."}

The cashier, and a different employee (and the woman who I interacted with the first time I came there) were all so genuine and friendly. Today was my second visit to the clement location and I will come back for another delicious vanilla coconut latte.", "author": "Brooke F."}

Lots of folks come here to work on their laptops, and people are generally friendly so you can share tables with them when it gets crowded.  The toast is also really tasty -- helps keep you going during those long work sessions.  No bike parking out front, but I'm going to ask about having a rack installed.", "author": "Cy C."}

I finally had the time  to grab coffee with a few friends and I'm so glad we chose Home. Everything about it was aesthetically pleasing and everything we chose was just as good as it looked if not more delicious, which says a lot because everything does in fact look amazing. If your coming with a group of people I suggest trying to get there early to snag the left corner booth because it's a great place to take pics. I can't wait to come here again and I hope that they keep creating unique lattes to add to the list.However, I can say if you want aesthetics you should go for the birthday cake or the red velvet(it's red with a white swan) but as far as taste goes they are all delicious(my fav rn tho is the choco mint). Lastly, I have to point out that the staff is super kind so as of now, I have literally no complaints and I can only highly suggest you try this place out.", "author": "Grace D."}

Stopped in for a coffee - and expected greatness because of the reviews here on yelp!  We got it!  Everyone loved their coffees.  Some were pour overs.  Mine was the \"Birthday Cake\" - and even though it was too pretty to drink - I slurped it down.  DELISH! We also ordered the Avocado Toast Sampler and the presentation was beautiful and all three slices were yum!  The owner (?) came by our table to check in - and told us that the interesting veggie on one of our avocado toasts was a slice of watermelon radish. (very hard to find!)  She stayed and chatted with us for awhile - and also told us that the expansion in the back is for their plan to be roasting their own coffee in the future.  She was filled with information and so passionate about her business (which she runs with her fiance).  We begged her to open in the south bay!  But for now - there are two locations and they are both right off 19th Ave - so go to this place next time you are driving north through the city.  You will leave happy!!!", "author": "Lizza M."}
