I usually don't review a place until I've been there a few times, but this was definitely worthy of some kind words. \n\nHad a long day of walking around the zoo with my daughter and this place is conveniently located across the street. There are only 3 tables in the tiny dining room, but there's a cool outdoor counter along the window ledge outside. It's also really warm in there, but that wasn't gonna stop us. The sausage goes on raw and is just super fresh. Nicely laid out on a layer of sliced mozzarella. Each bite was incredibly juicy and the crust was awesome. When I come back, I'm definitely gonna dive into some seafood pizza. Can't wait to try those clams. \n\nGreat job guys, I'll see you next time", "author": "Mark F."}

I thought to swing by after visiting the folks and ordered a medium - half cheese and the other pepperoni. Just for the longevity (and sure because I'm a nostalgic kind a guy, who misses the Doggie Diner once nearby), I give points for this Pasquale's. \n\nThis place also hasn't changed its look much - if at all - since my childhood days in the Outer Sunset, so more points for that. In addition, this joint has a no-frills decor and still uses an old cash register though credit cards are accepted. \n\nNow for the pizza: It had the right amount of cheese, didn't skimp on the pepperoni and had a good chewy though not doughy crust and bread. Bottom line, my family liked it a lot, and that's all that really mattered.", "author": "Neil G."}

The wild crazy eyed cashier one at the register had two simple jobs to do. Take my order and take my money, properly. That's the key. So as I told him what I wanted \"medium half combination half pepperoni and olives\"  \n\nwell he couldn't do those jobs right. \n\nOk he says. Rights it down. \n\nWhat size, x large? \n\nNo I said medium. As he runs the gals credit card and puts the slip in front of me but says it's for them. \n\nWhat size he asks. \n\nI say \" for the third time medium\" \nHe says ok I got it\n\nThen I get the bill and its 24.88 for a 21 dollar medium combination \nSo as I pay I ask why it's more than a medium Combo. He says I added olives. It's a extra topping for 175. But it and pepperoni are on the combo. So I hold my breath. Pay. And wait as the boys now say not nice things, in Spanish, about me questioning their tallying methods. . The lumpy cook could not stop glaring which made me look closely at what he was doing and it looked like there wasnt any pepperoni on the pep olive side so I waited \n\nThen the boss came back from doing deliveries and heard an earful of crap from his employee about how I'm questioning the process and the boss tells the line cook to shut the hell up and make the pizzas. That \"Nobody\" like me the customer \"wants to hear (his) opinion\". So at least the boss put that out there to him but when the pizza came out of the oven it was wrong. Half combo with just olives on the other side so I told him how he listened so amazingly  I didn't say he ripped me off for topping I paid for. And then didn't fulfill the order because he was too distracted by women and not able to take an order. It was real slow. Nobody was ordering.

Absolutely disgusting nearly inedible swirl/slop at this point! I have been dining and ordering from various Pasquale's my entire 48 year life and have been frequenting Pasquale's with my family since before I can even remember, but there is a huge difference between the two remaining restaurants, the main one on Irving and this dive spot on Sloat. \n\nI recently had a birthday and turned 48 and it was the first birthday in my life when I didn't at least meet up with family or friends on my special day, so feeling pretty bummed out that I had absolutely no plans for lunch, brunch or dinner on my actual birthday, decided to treat myself to some comfort food by myself. Called in to order a small two topping pizza for pickup; I save about 5 or 6 bucks on delivery fee and tip by driving about a mile away so I opted to call in my order and pick it up; to which I was told \"20 minutes.\" \n\nI showed up exactly 20 minutes later and my pizza wasn't ready. Big mistake on their behalf, because it gave me time to just stand there, look around and realize just how dirty, rundown and grimy this shack is. I never noticed how poor the integrity of the tiny building that looks like it could be brought down by one pass of a bulldozer is. pacing around for 10 minutes waiting for my pizza and looking around at nothing to really look at, what immediately stood out to me is that there were flies EVERYWHERE!!! The ingredients were uncovered and the two guys there didn't give half a crap. They were flying around the air and crawling over food behind  the counter; just gross! The place just looked gross and made me wonder about other times I had ordered from here and felt sick in the past. \n\nThe two guys working that night looked like they were somewhere between 18 and 20 and had no clue of how to make pizza! Making good pizza is actually an art with a science to it and requires some degree of taught skill. kneading the dough, tossing the dough, adding the right amount of olive oil, distributing the ingredients and cooking and toasting the pizza is all part of the process of making a good pizza. These guys just throw everything on the thick dough with no thought or skill to it at all, cook your pizza and put it in a b ox. It also smelled bad in the restaurant while I waited for ten minutes and on the way home the pizza actually smelled bad and I dreaded eating it, instead of when I used to bring a pizza from Pasquale's home, smelling the tempting aroma from the olive oil and other ingredients, just disgusted me. I almost wanted to throw it out, but I never waste money and hoped that it would taste good. .. Nope! tasted awful as well and just put the finishing insult to injury on one of my worst birthdays to date. \n\nI have never written or talked about this and this was long before Yelp and it's most likely under different management and staff but 25-30 years ago, I ordered a pizza from Sloat; clearly asked for a medium pizza with salami on the whole pizza and mushrooms on half of it and got a cheese pizza with mushrooms on one half which just didn't do it for me. I called to complain and the scuzbag who answered the phone said \"I can give you back a dollar for one ingredient; I should have argued to make me a whole new pizza or reimburse me for half but was young and just said \"well okay I guess\" the guy I had tipped a dollar; that's how much you tipped back then, showed up to my door looking like he wanted to rip my head off! and handed me a dollar! I know that the loser cook or manager told the kid that I wanted my tip back! That never sat well with me as not only did the cook on the phone screw up my order and ruined my pizza and then only offered a dollar back, but also told the poor delivery boy to drive way out of his way because I wanted my tip back! What a POS that guy was, back then. \n\nAnyway, I will never under any circumstances ever come back or order from Pasquale's on Sloat again. Pasquale's on Irving has also declined a bit but is a million times better than the one on Sloat. Never again on Sloat, never again.", "author": "David A."}

I'm staying in the same hotel in December and will be enjoying another one of these fantastic pizzas. \n\nThe only thing I can say about them as a criticism is that the small pizza is to big for one person.

This place can't even make a pizza that's mediocre much less good.  \n\nFirst of all, the place had 3 tables and 8 chairs.  Do the math and you realize that some casual lap dancing might be required if you plan to dine.  This may be a plus on dates but not so great for other occasions.  \n\nI ordered a pizza with 5 toppings and it came with 6.  We didn't want to wait another 15-20 mins and we were hungry after a long day at the zoo so we just took the pizza and removed the 6th topping.  Unfortunately, the 6th topping  happened to be Italian sausage that was pretty under cooked so that there was pink coloring on the larger pieces.  My family doesn't like sausage on pizza and the added hazard of uncooked pork didn't increase their excitement.  \n\nAll this was bad enough but the pizza itself isn't very good.  Not enough sauce and seasoning so it just tasted like sauteed veggies and half cooked meat on toast with cheese.  \n\nI should have asked for a refund but I was already tired, annoyed and my family wasn't going to put up with me arguing with the pizza place for another 10 mins.  I did point out the 6th topping, that it was undercooked, etc.  They didn't care and only offered to remove the topping which I just did myself since I didn't trust what else they might do with the pizza.  I guess the free glass of Sprite they gave me was  their compensation plan.  \n\nI decided to cut my losses and just threw the pizza out after everyone had a slice.

I've always loved it but tonight, a Friday, I called to order - the phone picked up, I heard the background noise of the restaurant and then click - it seemed I was simply hung up on. So, I called back and a dude said \"Pasquales, please hold, and he was gone. Now, I get that Friday nights can be busy but Pasquales on Sloat isn't exactly a dine-in place for Friday night dining so how busy could it be at the counter? I spent time tonight reading reviews because lately in the West Portal/Merced Manor area it seems no pizza place can get it right. I think the trouble with pizza is high employee turnover. \n\nSo, I actually did order and was told 20 minutes. I arrived on time and then waited about 15 more minutes - my pie went in the oven while I was there. There were a few people waiting too but no more than two pies in the oven at a time that I could see. I paid and 2 other people came in and ordered. The phone only rang three times the whole time I was there (at 8:30 on a Friday night) but the guy making the pizzas seemed to be hustling as if it was busy. \n\nThen, I saw the young man at the register go straight to the food assembly line and grab some cheese with his bare hands and sprinkle it on someone's garlic bread to help. I got up from my chair, crossed the room, and told him that he cannot work the register and then handle food without washing his hands. I looked him straight in the eye and said, \"I know you know that.\" To his credit, he looked contrite and had zero attitude. He said something to the cook in Spanish and they both looked over at me but neither had any attitude at all. He disappeared to the back and then came back up front and washed his hands at the sink. He looked scared. A few minutes later, I figured out why. An older man, who I assume is the owner, came in and began doing a few things. He never said a word, looked stern, and went about his business. I didn't have the heart to say anything because the register dude took the criticism well and I knew then he was a good kid. \n\nUnfortunately, they didn't connect that the small pizza they had made was for me so it went on top of the oven for a few minutes before they figured it out. I ordered 4 toppings and they missed one but they gave me my money back. The pizza was stretched a wee bit too thin so it collapsed and was wet in the center but it tasted good.The two stars were actually for the pizza. Delivery is way too slow. Order pick up. Personally, I think I jinxed myself by reading too many pizza reviews before ordering. Had I simply ordered blind, like I usually do, the universe probably would have given me a better experience.

At any given time there will be a Pasquale's box in our recycling.\n\nCheese pizza is the best - the crust has a good texture (not too chewy, not too crisp), the cheese is generous, the sauce is ok but a little bit acidic for me (slight tinny flavor).\n\nHam & pineapple is my second favorite.\n\nThe delivery people are very very very nice and the pizza usually arrives quickly.", "author": "Liz S."}

So it makes sense.\n\nBasically Pizza and Chinese food are the two foods you will never see me in the restaurant for... this is why they deliver. If I eat out and dine IN a restuarant I eat non deliverable food -- OBVIOUSLY -- and so should you. lol\n\nSo, Pasquale's is my second favorite Pizza place in San Francisco bra none ! (Milano's on 9th being my absolute favorite) -\n\nPasquale's on SLOAT pizza is very flavorful and ingrediants just POP in your mouth. The kind of flavor for pizza I am talking about is where you can actually taste the spices in the pepperoni, and actually taste the fennel in the sausage.... taste the tomato in the sause.. I mean seriously good authentic pizza here. Delivery is reasonable, and \nprice is great for what you get.\n\nThe combination is really packed. The pesto is real, the meats are just awesome, and the veggies are fresh and real. Not no frozen taste here. Real size cuts of the veggies so you know they don't have that \"cookie cutter\" frozen food size to them.\n\nReally a great pizza no matter what you order. The crust is perfect. Just chewy enough with out being to doughy, and just crispy enough for that real brick oven baked taste. The cheese is perfect, and perfect amounts of it as well. The pizza has that real \"rolled on flour\" taste on it. Unlike other places that are starting to use corn meal to roll the crust out on... When a pizza is really rolled out on a floured cutting board then hand tossed, you can tell.\n\nAnd for my patented \"Is It A Get Laid At The End Of The Night Place\" review --------- Well,,, its delivery, so you probably JUST got laid before you ordered it !!. So honestly it is NOT one of those places.\n\nBut, all in all, the pizza is very impressive and you should try it. Highly recommended by me.\n\nDisclaimer - I am only talking about the one on Sloat. I am not speaking of the other 2 in the city. As they are good too, I feel this one just has a better taste to it.", "author": "Joel D."}

It contends consistently for the top 1 and 2 of my favorite pizzas in San Francisco.  I've lived in the City since 2000, and I came from the East Coast.  I'm comparing to pizzas like Armand's in DC, if you're familiar.  I order delivery from Pasquale's all the time, and they never disappoint.  For my expectations, you can't get as good a New York style pizza anywhere else in San Francisco.  Of course, pizza preference is subjective, but for my money, I'll always call on Pasquale's.", "author": "Tim S."}

I agree, unlike Zachary's, this restaurant is not one where you can hang out as it's too small.  They have like 4 tables in there or something like that.  However, as others have said, this restaurant is prime for take out orders as they only charge at most $2 for delivery charges if you're in the peninsula area (I think the farthest they go to is Daly City/South San Francisco).  They are quite fast with their delivery as well.\n\nNow, the pizza. The crusts are pretty basic.  However their pizzas are outstanding.  They have pretty good deals if you want 2 large pizzas.  They also have occasional coupons in the ads so look out for those.  \n\nOverall, I love this place.  Should have gotten 1 more star but it's one dimensional in the fact that you can't dine their like other pizza joints.  However, I've been going there for about 2 decades now so it gives you an idea of what kind of pizza place this, or I'm just someone with bad taste who happens to not like change =P.  I'd like to believe the former.", "author": "Joe V."}

No, not led, forced me to make it my first pizza joint in SF (newly arrived).\n\nTheir sausage was pretty stand-out; a nice a sweet fennel note to it. The crust was nice but the sliced mozza made me think of kraft singles and undoubtedly tainted my experience.  Fresh mushrooms though, gotta appreciate that.\n\nOverall an average pie that should satisfy East Cost tastes but will leave those who've experienced wood-fired goodness scratching their heads.", "author": "david r."}

I've NEVER seen anyone actually eat in the place, seems like now its basically take-out and delivery, though you might be able to eat there if you wanted.\n\nAlmost always there are 2 guys and a girl working there. The girl handles all orders (in person and on phone) and can seem short. Communicating with her can sometimes be a challenge, but dont let that turn you off. The 2 guys are behind the counter making pizza, so you could watch if you want (idk why you would).\n\nOn to the food. The first time I ate there, I ordered a pizza with extra cheese. WOW sooooo much cheese, basically too much. I almost always order extra cheese when I eat pizza, but at Pasquale's they use a lot of cheese to begin with!\nI've since eaten there multiple times and I'd have to agree with Shelly G, in that its not consistent. On the lower side its basically just a typical pizza place, but on the high side its definately above average. Its never spectacular, but it serves its purpose as a pizza place here deep in the outer sunset.\n\nBasically I wouldnt tell anyone that they have to eat here, but if you're looking for a pizza place out here its pretty good. Its definately on my rotation of pizza places.", "author": "Josh S."}

The waiter negotiated with us about what appetizer/salad we would choose, stopped in on us to provide extra napkins and tidbits every three minutes or so, and- a pet peeve of mine- came by the table twice while we determined the check.  He also seemed to come by every time someone was about to say something scandalous (and fun)!  But I believe his intentions were good.  We negotiated into getting a mixed salad (fine, mediocre), got some burned bread, and a pizza that was cooked too quickly and at two high a temperature (so the dough was undercooked and the crust and bottom burned)- vegetables thrown on haphazardly.  The atmosphere was fine, the carafe of wine was watered down but a good deal, and I felt they were trying hard to be so good.  I would only go there again if I were drunk.", "author": "Melissa W."}
