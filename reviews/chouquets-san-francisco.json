We went for brunch on a Sunday morning. There was no wait but the place is not empty either. My boyfriend got the salmon Benedict and I got their omelet, both of which are really good. \n\nI wanted fresh juice and ordered the grapefruit juice. After I got the grapefruit juice, the waitresses brought me another glass of orange juice for free, since the grapefruit juice is not freshly squeezed today (it usually is). Just really great attitude overall. \n\nThis place is super pet friendly. It's located close to SPCA, and lots of pet owners bring their dogs over. The waiters even brought the dogs water bowl to their tables so they keep hydrated. I would definitely come back here in the future.i", "author": "Jessie L."}

Prices are typical of bistro French, but the \"flamenkuche\" or \"tarte flambait\" (as I encountered it in Alsace) is cheap and a light lunch. I've had it several times. Their version has thinly sliced  apples or pears under the caramel used onions. I usually get it with a salad, which makes it a not so cheap but satisfying lunch. The smoked trout salad is excellent. I've always gotten plenty of fish on it. Had the butter lettuce salad today which had a champagne shallot dressing. The dressing wasn't equally distributed when it was tossed but oh well. \n\nThey have a smallish wine list but they also have a limited edition wine list which I choose from. That one gives more of a blurb for each wine and encourages you to branch out. I rarely order Cabernet Sauvignon in restaurants. It's never a good deal. They have a Beaujolais right now that's really good. I like gamay and Cabernet franc a lot -- good value for high quality. \n\nBeer drinkers take note: they have Duvel on tap!!!!!!  I've never seen that before. \n\nI've also had a lamb navarin here when the spring vegetables are available. It was one of the best balanced dishes I've had. Truly memorable. \n\nDon't pass on desert. The floating island is very well done here. \n\nAnd the sidewalk seating is some of the best in San Francisco. Clean, quiet neighborhood and not next to a bus stop.", "author": "Tim P."}

However that was my fault and we were already there, so we decided to stay there to eat anyways.  But right when we arrived, I was already not receiving great service already because they had a sign in sheet at the front of the restaurant where you write the amount of people in your group and your name to be called, yet after 15 minutes of waiting for them to call someone's name, there was another group of customers that showed up and talked to the waitress and got seated immediately. That was when we realized that they weren't even utilizing the sign in sheet that they had outside by the front, and I honestly wish they had said something since we were standing right at the front of the restaurant. In the end we talked to the waitress, and got seated immediately as well. \nWe didn't realize that this was only the start of a long waiting game here. After being seated, we waited about 10 minutes before menus were given to us -- and then the servers never once came back to check on us to see if we're ready to order or wanted something to drink. After about 15 minutes of waiting and the waitress repeatedly dropping by to check on the table next to us and not even acknowledging us or looking at us, we spent the next 10 minutes trying to get their attention so that we can order our food. After ordering, suddenly a waiter appeared and asked us if we would like to have some complimentary bread and butter (something that the waitress also neglected to ask us about despite asking the table next to us about it -- I wonder why that is). The food came relatively quickly afterwards, and to be honest, it was good but it was also very similar to many other places that serves brunch. Then, once again, it was another 20 minutes of us desperately trying to get the waitress' attention so that we can get our check and leave because we were never checked on even though it was very obvious that we have been done with our meal for a while since our plates were already empty.\n\nI really think that if we had the same service as the table next to ours, then I would definitely love to come back to this place.

If croutons/stale bread are your thing, you might like the texture. Not me. \n\nI can quite honestly say that it was the most mediocre cheese plate I've ever received at any restaurant in my life. If you go here, don't order it unless you want a disappointing experience. \n\nThey cheaped out on the cheese that they used, but it would be an insult to Costco or Trader Joe's to suggest that Choquet's is sourcing their cheese from either location. Maybe they buy up stale cheeses past the \"sell by\" date at bottom barrel prices from who knows where? Grocery Outlet? A strong accusation but that's how their cheese *tasted* to me.\n\nThey also provide free bread and butter in the form of generic supermarket quality baguette slices and equally generic butter (but kudos I suppose, that the butter was served soft and warm, not cold). \n\nTwo stars only because the service was okay (though it took them awhile to bring out the cheese plate) and the outdoor seating was pleasant.

We popped in for a late lunch, and ordered an ahi tuna nicoise salad and a burger with french fries. The nicoise had all the requisite ingredients: green beans, greens, with hard-boiled egg and boiled potatoes, green and black olives, cherry tomatoes. It came sprinkled with with their mustard based house vinaigrette. The burger was on a sesame seed bun, pickles, and the like. The salad, though I tried to gussy it up with extra dressing, was insipid and had no oomph, no pizazz, no sparkle. It was worth eating only for the nutrition. The tuna, mercifully, was fresh and grilled well, tender in the middle, and the fresh anchovies were beautiful, added just the perfect amount of flavor to the mix. The dressing was as bland and unassuming as any I've had. The burger was inedible, dry and not a bit moist, no flavor from the meat or the bun. The fries were terrific, excellent crunch to soft centers. Maybe it was our fault for ordering the meat well-done--except that we usually get it that way, and many places manage to preserve the juices. This was like chewing on a block of sawdust. We did not eat it. The service was fantastic--warm and friendly, prompt, from everyone from the busboy to the hostess and server. They split our plates, smiling and sweet. Such a shame that the food sucked, because the service couldn't be better, which is why I'm giving it a higher rating than I otherwise would. The ambience is everything you'd expect from a small French bistro--polished wood tables with cloth napkins, small and intimate space, restrooms to the rear. I appreciated that there was no blaring music. Quiet and dignified, with the option to sit outside on a sunny day.

We also really enjoyed the great and fun discussion we had with the manager Robert!  Really nice guy :)\n- The seating area: Indoor and outdoor heated area, sweet and cosy in the current San Franciscan winterish weather.\n\nWhat needs improvement:\n- The FOOD!!!! (Did I say it loud enough ?! ;). Really , for a French Bistro, we were disappointed by the food quality and taste. Let me explain more:\n     * The bread and butter: tasteless\n     * The ice tea: I tasted water rather than ice tea\n     * The steak & frittes: great steak sauce (au poivre), though the steak meat was not. The French fries were ok (cold thought)\n\n\nI really hope this restaurant can revamp its \"cuisine\"... and start offering spirits like the Pastis.", "author": "Gilbert B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-28", "description": "There's probably something to be said for a spot when there are nearby brunch spots with lines topping two hours and a place like Chouquet's finds itself with a wait to speak of. I risked, it, but my intuition came back to bite me a bit and my brunch experience wasn't much to write home about. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nThe service and atmosphere at Chouquet's a fine, but it's nothing special. Be advised that the outdoor seating can approach sweltering temps when the actual outdoor temp is anything about 80, but that's offset by friendly and fast service in addition to the fact that you probably won't have many of those days anyway. All in all nothing to complain about. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nFor the most part, Chouquet's brunch in particular is priced fairly, with standard dishes like eggs benedict and various omelettes somewhere between $12 and $15. I instead opted for the Steak Frite, which was a hefty portion but came with a pretty hefty price tag amounting to $25 for the dish. That's a bit high, but again that's unique to what I ordered versus the status quo here at Chouquet's. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nLike I alluded to early in the review, my dish, and the dishes of those in my party, were nothing special. My steak was fairly plain and a wee bit tough considering I essentially paid $25.00 for it, and the fries were actually the highlight of the dish (crispy on the outside soft and flavorful on the inside). My friends didn't seem blown away by their egg dishes either, and at the end of the day I can kind of see why there wasn't a line out front. No Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nI've had much better brunches than what I experienced at Chouquet's, and they're going to need to up their game to compete with the spots that are racking up serious lines on weekend mornings. No Star Granted.", "author": "Paul V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-04-30", "description": "I was really hoping to love this place because I love French food, I've spent some time living in France, and I wanted desperately to find a go-to place for French food.  Unfortunately, the dishes we ordered reminded me of going over to your friend's house for a homemade dinner -- a dinner that was edible, but a little rough around the edges because your friend is just a home cook with a non-culinary day job, passionately cooking from recipes from a cookbook.  Nowhere near restaurant quality.  With $25 - 29 price tag for most of the meat/fowl entrees for dinner, I can't see myself dining there again.\n\nFirst sign of trouble was the charcuterie board, with a ramekin of mousse de foie gras ($20).  The cured meats were fine.  But I will bet my first born that mousse was no foie gras!  Or it had so little foie gras mixed in relative to regular liver that it made no difference!  It was hard, dense, grainy and bland.  It was a bit better with some salt, and was tasty as just a liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, so we finished it.  Either the chef was putting one over on people unfamiliar with real foie gras, or their supplier was putting one over on the chef, who is unfamiliar with real foie gras.  I'm not alone -- I checked the Yelp reviews after I came home to find that someone else had observed the foie gras mousse was grainy and bad. (http://www.yelp.com/biz/chouquets-san-francisco?hrid=9F4RAojlKTKcWSBkcN6-OQ)\n\nThe cassoulet ($25) and canard \u00e0 l'orange ($29) did not save the experience.  The beans of the cassoulet were well-seasoned, but the meat and sausage inside the stew were totally bland.  The beans were so overdone that they totally fell apart and disintegrated with the slightest stir, and the stew took on the consistency of refried beans or dense mashed potatoes.  The confit in the stew had an exterior that was harder than jerky.  Neither of us could chew through it and had to spit it out.  \n\nThe canard \u00e0 l'orange would have been fine except for the $29 price tag.  For that price, I expected at least the cook on the duck to be done expertly.  The main disappointments were the blandness and the uncrispy, unrendered, flabby skin.  After a liberal sprinkling of salt, the flavors of the orange-infused brown gravy were quite nice and I finished my serving.  Like I had mentioned, edible, but not going-out-to-eat special, not for $29 and with so many other restaurants around.\n\nSince the duck and the p\u00e2t\u00e9 were all eaten, we didn't feel right commenting on it to the waiter, but we couldn't let the cassoulet go.  It was a struggle to eat it and we gave up after a few bites each.  We showed the waiter the half-eaten dish and the crusted-over meat, and he agreed to take it off our bill.  Otherwise this would be a one-star review.", "author": "Rhys C."}

Wtf?! I had to eat them together to get a decent bite, but eating each component separately was all bad!\nThe mousse appetizer - I don't even know how to explain how bad this was. You know that nice creamy flavorfulness that pates should have? This had none of that. It was almost like eating butter with a weird mealy gaminess to it. My mom, who can finish a whole 5oz jar of foie from bouchon couldn't even finish this tiny portion!\nSalmon entree - We had asked that the salmon be on the rare side since I hate overcooked salmon, but it came out flaky, meaning super overcooked. The texture was just awful. None of the nice fatty slipperiness of the fish remained.\n\nThe rest of the dishes, I only recall as being okay. Nothing exceptional or bad about them.

When Google had a $20 for $40 worth of food at Chouquet's, I jumped on the offer.  \n\nRESERVATIONS:\nI was able to make reservations on opentable.com for a party of three for Tuesday night.  Even though it was a bit on the empty side, I recommend making reservations since the place is on the smaller side.  Recently I noticed that reservations are available on Savored (take advantage of the 15-30% off your bill discount!).  There is both indoor and outdoor seating available.\n\nSPECIALS:\nTuesdays - $1 oysters\nWednesday - no corkage fee\n\nNote: Portions are on the smaller side.  The three of us ordered oysters, 3 appetizers, and 3 entrees and it worked out perfectly\n\nAPPETIZERS:\n*Escargots de Bourgogne ($10) - The dish was okay.  Though the dish is nicely presented, creamy white sauce doesn't compliment escargots very well in my opinion.\n*Kobe Beef Tartare ($15) - An appetizer must order!  The beef was extremely tender and had the perfect balance of tart to it.  Served with crispy crostinis. \n\nENTREEES:\n*Moules Marinieres ($18) - Delicious! This dish was the winner of the night.  Thin cut French fries are served on the side.  Though the mussels were on the smaller side, what really made the dish was the cream white wine sauce.  Make sure you use the bread to soak up the creamy sauce!\n*Raviole aux Epinards ($18) - Pass.  Though the sauce was, there just wasn't enough of it.  The five pieces of spinach filled raviolis just didn't have enough flavor to it.\n*Seared Dayboat Scallops with Black Risotto ($23) - Three large scallops are served on a bed of black risotto with a creamy vierge sauce.  The scallops were tasty, but the downfall of the dish was the risotto.  The only way the risotto had flavor to it was by using the sauce...and the risotto temperature wasn't even hot.   On the other hand, the accompanied asparagus were good. \n\nSERVICE:\nOur waiter was nice and friendly.

Five perfectly cooked day boat scallops surrounding a mushroom risotto. The sauce was amazing and not too rich...each bite was full of flavor and I ended up cutting a few of the scallops into fours just to make it last longer. Nice, right!?\n\nMy friend had the filet and it was a also great and cooked to a perfect medium due to the fact it was cooked by the French chef (inside joke...sorry). Is it me or are the steaks at French restaurants underrated? \n\nWe skipped dessert, but had some dessert wine and sunk into excellent conversation about everything from retirement real estate in Mexico to capital punishment around the world. Good food and drink make you stick around the restaurant to enjoy the ambiance and soak in the moment.

It was actually pretty tasty. There was quite a bit of trout in there. \n\nHalf Roasted chicken - I ordered this. Normally, I am not a huge fan of anything with bones but this was tender and juicy. Cutting it off the bone wasn't a chore. Also came with carrots and fingerling potatoes. Yum. \n\nGrilled Alaskan Salmon with white wine sauce, veggies & truffle mashed potatoes  22 - I ordered this for my mom. The salmon is cooked to the point where it is just right. My mom likes her fish to be a bit more overly cooked. I hear people like it when it is just cooked. Mash potatoes wasn't a lot. Veggies are asparagus and peas - grilled. I liked the veggies. \n\nThe waitress handed us each a dessert menu. Originally, I wanted us to get fro-yo but what the heck! We're already here.

I would\n\nLong story short my wife and I went here with another couple for NYE and were forced to pay a $65 prix fix meal.  The price of $65 was fine but the service and food was not.\n\nTo make a long story short, they screwed up Lobster.  LOBSTER.  You know...the crustacean that you put into a pot of boiling water, take it out after about 10 minutes and put butter on???  Ya, they didn't do that.  The decided to put some disgusting white/celery sauce on top of the split tail.  The Lobster itself was tough and stringy, and was almost impossible to pull out of the shell.  The sauce tasted something between a bad homemade tartar sauce and an overly celery'd lobster roll. \n\nBefore the main dish I had lobster bisque, which was nice, and the smoked salmon app, which was ok but had too much creme cheese wrapped into the fish.  After the lobster debacle, they finished off the menu with a \"Easy Bake oven'esque\" chocolate and vanilla ice cream dessert.  Needless to say, after I only ate 1/2 of the lobster tail and truffle risotto, I was not hungry for dessert.\n\nThe funny thing that happened is when the bus boy came by to pick up our plates, he said to me \"Hey you have 1/2 a lobster tail on your plate\" and I replied \"Ya...there's a reason for that...it is terrible.\"  He said that he would get the server and she came by.  Visibly upset she asked me what was wrong with the lobster tail and dish and I told her.  She replied \"Well since it's a prix fix meal, we can not deduct cost or offer a refund, so if there is anything else we can do please let me know.\"  I simply ordered a nice Bordeaux and left it at that, but I was not happy.\n\nOther notes:\n\n1.  They forgot to leave menus when they seated us, and didn't realize until about 20 mins later.\n\n2.  They sat us outside, where it was chilly and uncomfortable, especially for the wives with SKIRTS ON!\n\n3.  After the lobster tail episode, the server returned and said directly to me \"Oh you're back\" to which our entire table was extremely confused.\n\n4. Rude and S...L...O...W... service.  Arrived at 830 pm and left at 11pm for a 3 piece meal.\n\n5.  If you want a substitution, don't expect one.  If you want an answer from the chef, don't expect one.  If you want a good meal, MacDonald s has a dollar menu and is better quality.\n\nThe bottom line is, this restaurant is not good.

Think five years working two blocks away and passing it up thinking to yourself, \"Another time.\" Not today.\n\nI felt good, it was such a beautiful sunny afternoon.  And I was dressed for winter. Eh, so be it, I'm from the city. I wanted a salad after I messed up my arugula from home. No one says this, or I actually don't know anyone that says this, but I actually was CRAVING a nice salad. Check out my little quote, \"I ain't no salad eating chick.\" Well, I gotta change that now. Change is good.\n\nThe salad that appealed to me was the Arugula and Frisse salad with proscuitto, cherry tomatoes and poached egg. My memory cells really must be gone because as soon as the salad arrived, I thought the white stuff was cheese. Nice. I was wrong though. It was the poached egg because you shoulda seen the look on my face when I accidently popped it and all the yolk started dripping onto the greens. It was a look of surprise and \"Oh yeah! Poached egg!\" I obviously have not had a poached egg before, but because of this salad, I'm gonna do my hardest to try and poach an egg.\n\nThis salad was so wonderfully refreshing, delicous and satisfied my craving so bad that I ate it painfully slow, really savoring all the interesting flavors coming together in my mouth. It was so excellent that I thanked the really pretty server for recommending it to me and I swear I'm coming back just to have it over and over again. Then again, I guess I could make it at home. But the dining experience alone is just so... I don't know, an experience I love having.\n\nThe atmosphere of the place is great.

It was semi like an open kitchen decor, which made it super cute. The waiter here was very nice and attentive, he brought us our drinks and bread and he gave us refills on both constantly. \n\nThey have a Prix Fixe menu set at $30.00, but it is only good between the hours of 5:30 to 7:30. Their menu does not include a huge selection, but their Prix Fixe menu is good enough already. You can either order clam Chowder or their trout to start off. For the main course you have the option of their Veggie Gnochhi, Seared Ahi Tuna or Kobe Beef Burger.  And for desserts you can chose from their Chocolate Fondant or Creme Brulee..  \n\nMy friend ended up getting the  Clam Chowder and Ahi Tuna. I had a few sips of her chowder and I must say, it was the best Clam Chowder I ever had in the world!   I think the reason why I love it, is because you can tasted the bacon and potatoes in it and they give you so many clams in the soup.  I also took a few bites of the Ahi Tuna, which turned out pretty good as well.  \n\nI actually heard that their lamb was pretty good so i ordered the Lamb shoulder braised, mushroom truffle oil & pommes salardaise.  What is Pommes Salardase you ask? Well it's not salad.  It's like potatoes, but fried like chips.   I fell in love with this dish! The lamb was so tender and juicy, I have to say it must be true when they say they braised it for 7 hours.  I loved their potatoes, it went perfectly well with the lamb the their sauce.  \n\nFor dessert my friend and i shared their Chocolate Fondant.  It was made to perfection!  It was warm and fluffy. So fluffy you are going to die! The chocolate came oozing out when second you cut into it and it went great with the Vanilla Ice cream.  \n\nI wished i had an extra Groupon ticket so I can come here again, but even without it, I'm already planning to come back.

We decided on the regular menu because well, we didn't feel the DAT choices.  \n\nSo for $11, we started with a half dozen of Effigham Oysters.  They tasted ok, but I've had oysters that tasted more fresh and oceanic, if you will.  For $13 I ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict, served w/a side salad.

With Michelinization, inflation and crowds tainting so many other spots, this place is a blessing. The Frenchie-style ambiance is perfect to meet friends, have fun, and drink some wine. On the food front, I would 100% order the chicken, it's some of the most tender breast I've had, even better than those rotisserie chickens you find elsewhere. When asked about the secret it was revealed that this place gets 'small' chickens, something you can't buy at the market. The sole fish dish was excellent too. It is hard to mess sole up, but the subtle flavors here combined with the delicate fish were great. The beef bourgogne was par, great sauce, less fatty but slightly dry meat, wouldn't get that again unless I was craving it. The wine comes in half bottles but you may want to bring your own. Very pleasant staff that dispels the French are rude stereotype. Will return when the time in right.", "author": "Brian J."}

We were totally full after eating ~3 dozen mussels each, a full side of fries, and their tasty bread. Usually we split an appetizer and sometimes split a dessert also, but there was no chance after eating all that. A choice of six sauces for the mussels is offered. We picked saffron and spicy tomato. Both were good, and the spice with the tomatoes was mild, yet flavorful. \n\nOur server was very nice. In addition, the pacing/speed of a meal has never been a problem at Chouquet's, which can allow for a slower or quicker meal, especially for a French restaurant. I've eaten dinners inside and brunch outside here.\n\nCombining all this with an easily accessible location creates a very good, yet casual, experience.", "author": "Mike H."}

Their outdoor seating, which is on Washington Street, has a nice layout with the sight of Alta Plaza and the quiet neighborhood leading to the park on Washington Street, away from the busy traffic on Fillmore.  Indoor seating is also very nice for a weekend brunch in this 'L' shaped restaurant with most of the seats in close proximity to the big windows with plenty of light.\n\nAs you would expect from a French restaurant, their brunch food is more of a polished kind, rather than the all American diner breakfast food.  They have greens w/ nice balsamic vinegar instead of hash on the side.  I had their Croque-Monsieur which was pretty good, but I liked the one at Butler & the Chef Bistro (http://www.yelp.com/biz/NYP4d9HiiDHt9iYYgoqnxw) more.  Their brunch menu had 12 selections, but for some reason, I felt that it lacked selection.  Perhaps because if you don't want a salad (I like real food), then it wipes out half of the items on the menu.  Most items are $9-12 which was quite reasonable.\n\nPerhaps 3 stars was a tough rating for a nice restaurant, but I felt that their brunch was average and there are so many other places offering better brunch, including Elite Cafe (http://www.yelp.com/biz/NhvqEIpcLbwFhW1cEVSzoA) just down the road.", "author": "\u30c8\u30e2 T."}

The trout was good, the little pumpkin seeds (which I didn't know were pumpkin seeds but I asked cause I liked them so much in the salad) were great, and the salad overall, mmm!  I split this and the crispy rolls of Baramundi with one of my friends, and the rolls were ok, but not that memorable (also gingery, so if you don't like ginger, it is infused with the taste even though my friend said she barely knew it was there).\n\nThen I moved onto the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio..  I felt slightly mixed about this one.  The tuna itself was really good, but it was covered by the green stuff on top (cilantro, was it?  Tasted a lot like cilantro) and that's all I really ended up tasting.

Overall, the food here was ok.  The presentation of the food here was beautiful though.  \n\nPrice:\nIt costs around $15-$20 for an order of food + drink here. \n\nMy overall experience here at Chouquet's was just ok.

An amuse was semi-cold and tasteless.  Two dishes were next to inedible - first was a seafood rissoto of obviously not fresh seafood that came out room temperature.  When we asked if they had any way of warming it up the waitress helpfully said yes, then the same dish came back to us ladled with a lots of pasty untasty slightly sweet sauce.  The other was a dessert, some kind of berry tart or something.  It was watery and bland, as if someone had poured a quarter cup of tapwater on top.

We found parking right in front of the restaurant and were seated at a corner table which I had pointed out from outside and had mental dibs on. I like that this restaurant sits on the corner street and is lined with glass windows. \n\nCame here with a  group of three, a fourth arrived later- after the entrees but before dessert- and was accommodated immediately and even given his own bill at the end- this gesture, truly makes for a skilled and observant server! We shared the mussels, it was heavenly, perfect broth, perfect everything (I'm going to try to copy this at home). I always prefer my shellfish in white wine over red wine. Came with a side of skinny, non greasy fries. Two of us ordered the Riz St Jacques - the scallops were perfect but the black risotto- whoa, the black risotto with visible melted butter on top was divine. I never knew risotto could be so succulent, it wasn't mushy or watery, it had the perfect consistency. My friend ordered Cassoulet, Muscovy duck legs cooked in confit, I wish I tried this to provide some kind of reference but I was too full and content with my own plate. We kept the drinks coming, I had the wine that tasted like a peach Bellini, it was iced and thirst quenching. My friends tried the port and other wines, not one bad wine.  \nFor dessert, it was chocolate cake with a rich fudge-filling that oozed out and filled the air with great sweetness. I'll upload pictures shortly. \n\nSay what you will about the French. I like French people and French food and can't wait to visit its country, planning is in the works. The food is outstanding and not heavy, the server is a complete doll. She humored back with us a couple times and took absolute care of us. As we were the second to last table to exit, I couldn't help but tell the guy holding open the door, \"I'm going to write you a 5 Star Review on Yelp\". So mark my words, here I am. \n\nWhat was even more memorable was the sound of an opera singer coming from within the kitchen, we debated whether he was a real man or whether it was music beaming from the speakers. We finally settled on the fact that it was a happy chef and continued to hear his melodic voice echo and accompany us all the way to the end of the street. \n\nWhat a lovely end to the beginning of a long night. \nMerci.", "author": "Thuy M."}

This is extremely unfortunate, since it's literally a block away from my apartment, but even that level of convenience could not drive me to eat here again.\n\nChouquet's is perfect if you're looking for horrible food and mediocre service as a premium price. While I've been to Chouquet's many times, and experienced the lackluster food and inattentive service each time, the proximity to my apartment kept me coming back, but after my last meal there I don't think I can put myself through it again.\n\nThe day after a late night out with friends visiting from out of town, I meandered over to Chouquet's for brunch with my visitors. I was craving something really hearty so I ended up ordering the \"Wagyu Burger\" (I highly doubt this was Wagyu beef) which was something like $13. Now I'm more than willing to pay for a good hamburger, but what was brought to my table was the most pathetic excuse for a hamburger I have ever seen. The pale gray/brown color of the perfectly round/obviously de-frosted patty was hard to even look at. It reminded me of some sort of frozen/microwaveable beef dish you might find at Wal-Mart. On top of this patty sat 1 strip of bacon that looked like it had been under a heating lamp since the previous weekend - dry, flavorless, and with the same gray undertones of the patty. All of this was served atop a bun that dwarfed the undersized beef patty. I somehow managed to eat the entire thing along with the soggy french fries even without 1 refill of my water glass the entire meal. I wanted to ask for more water but I didn't want to interrupt the very interesting conversation all the waiters were having while we went unattended.\n\nWhen I finished the meal, I sat there feeling as if I had just been robbed. In a city with some of the most amazing restaurants in the country, there is NO reason to ever eat at Chouquet's. Unfortunately 1-star is as low as I can go with this rating, but it really doesn't even deserve that.", "author": "Marc C."}

This is our second visit here and  we decided to come back because we were hoping for the same good food and service we enjoyed on our first time.\n\nMy wife had the omelette and I had the burger.  The food took awhile but it was sort of busy, everyone was running around.  When the food finally came, it was just dropped off and the server kept on running.  It would of been nice to ask if we needed anything else since ketchup goes well on an omelette, burger and fries.  I even left my empty glass of lemonade so they may get the idea that I would like a refill.  We both sat there trying to get someone's attention and after a few minutes, we got the attention of the bartender.  We asked him for some ketchup and mayo, he went into the kitchen, came back out and forgot about us.  While we were waiting for some service, I was able to get a hold of some Tabasco by walking out of the restaurant and grabbing it from an outside table.\n\nAfter seeing our server bussing some tables, which must be more important than checking up on her tables, we finally got her attention and finally got some ketchup and mayo.  By this time, my wife's ice tea and my lemonade were empty, sitting at the edge of the table.  You would think that the server would notice this since it's the first thing you see when you approach the table but, clueless.  We did get our refills after flagging her down again but at the end of our meal.\n\nCouple of other things that bothered us were seeing the bartender wiping down the counter and dump the crumbs onto the floor right in front of us.

I ordered a lentil soup, not realizing it was a pure. It was fine, nice, but nothing shocking or exciting. I've had better lentil soup from a box. My main course, however, was a true pleasure - lamb braised for hours fell apart on my plate. I lightly touched it with my fork and it fell apart into dozens of little pieces on my plate.  For lamb lovers, it is a must. Or for truffle lovers, it is a must as it is accompanied by a simple yet addictive tear-drop shaped pile of truffle mashed potatoes. It's total comfort food.\n\nThe tarte tatin is classic and well-executed - I'm a bit confused why people talk about apple sauce on Yelp in regards to it. Yes, the apples are caramelized and tender, much more so than apple pie, but they're not pureed! \n\nMy only gripe is the corkage fee - $20 a bottle? Ouch.

Were the judges from England? The menu is small, but looked decent; they were missing a few things (Ok it's Monday).  The Clam chowder tasted like warm cream, absolutely no flavor.  My friends said the asparagus soup was also bland and heavy on the cream.  The halibut special, $22, was like an inch wide and 4\" long.  My gnocchi special was mostly frozen peas and one of the skinniest asparagus I have ever seen served in SF; the gnocchi were ok.  Seared tuna was three tiny pieces of sashimi and mostly greens. Desserts were ok and the trout salad was something I would have again.  We wouldn't have stayed for dessert, but two of us had chosen the 3-course meal.\n\nWould have been 2 star's but our waitress stole the show.  We were the only people in the place when we sat, except a few folks at the bar.  After ordering a bottle of wine, she came back a few minutes later to take the order.  When we asked for a few more minutes, she rolled her eyes and gave an audible \"tsk\" as she walked off.  Then later, upon ordering gnocchi one of us asked if there was any cheese...her response - \"we're not an italian restaurant\" (although they did have grated parmesan, wtf?)   \n\nFunny, b/c she wasn't french either, and one of us was.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-11-30", "description": "Chouquet's is a twelve-year-old in her mother's evening gown: touches of elegance, but missing some fundamentals. Four of us ladies ordered the Prix Fixe menu, and it was immediately clear that the descriptions were hard to discern and that even the waiter wasn't sure what we would get. The wine list had a very nice array of choices by the glass, though, and we were all able to select dishes we liked. \n\nFor the first course, I had the smoked salmon salad, which had well-balanced flavors and textures. Two of us had a clam chowder that went over well, but our fourth found her veggie bisque bland.\n\nThe veggie gnocci was a pile of contradictions. Good: crispy sage, butter sauce, and gnocci sauteed lightly for a very nice flavor and texture. Boring: peas, lots of 'em. Bad: lots of asparagus stems, one of them too tough to chew, but nary a single asparagus tip. That tough stem lost you a whole star, Chouquet's. Rookie move.\n\nThe kobe beef burger was confusing: the waiter seemed to think it would come with a potato galette, but it came with fries. The potatoes were billed as cooked in duck fat, but if they were I couldn't taste a difference. The seared ahi, on the other hand, came exactly as expected, with a zingy salad, and seemed to be the most successful entree. \n\nWe all ordered the creme brulee for dessert, but then I saw the fondant-and-gelato plate go by and changed my order. Once again fooled by the description, I'd assumed it was mostly gelato with some kind of icing, but it turned out to be a dark-chocolate cake with a molten center. It was elegantly presented, rich, and satisfying, though a bit more bitterness would have been welcome with the sweet gelato. I didn't taste the creme brulee, but my friends seemed happy with it. \n\nSecond rookie mistake: we were presented with the bill with no offer of coffee, tea, or dessert wine, any of which I would gladly have enjoyed. Since we each spent $50, all told, I can't imagine that we were being rushed away to let in the big spenders... A little port or cappucino would've probably added a hefty percentage to the bill and the tip, not to mention a star. \n\nI hope Chouquet's manages to stay around long enough to grow into its elegant ambitions.", "author": "Vivian V."}

But then again Marina locals is a bit of an oxymoron, so...\n\nAnyway, back to Chouquet's. Since it sits at the very top of Fillmore (at Washington), it's past the hustle and bustle of the street, but still in a central area. The space is small, but fills up quickly at dinnertime (I went around 7pm). The food was fantastic. We first shared the kobe beef tartar and then I had the salmon that came in a wine, cream sauce, plus a side of the frites (I'm a french-fry fanatic). Everything here is buttery smooth and just melts in your mouth. For dessert, we shared a chocolate, lava-sort-of cake that came with ice cream. Again, more meltiness in my mouth.

We had a group of 6, so we were expecting to have to wait wherever we ended up.  Chouquet's sat us right away, and enticed us in with the \"Mango Mimosas\" sign.  After sitting down and ordering drinks, half of us received our drinks pretty quickly, but the other half waited another 15 minutes for theirs.  They were pretty busy, but it didn't make sense that half the mimosas came out in one wave, where the second wave of mimosas took another 20 minutes.  Anyway, the food took forever to get out too.  I ordered the three egg omelette with bacon, onion and spinach.  Some of my omelette wasn't completely cooked, so I had to eat around the runny parts of it, meaning I couldn't eat my favorite item: bacon.  My boyfriend had the Wagyu burger with french fries and liked his dish.  The french fries were delicious, so Chouquet's gets one star for delicious french fries, and one for having a mango mimosa.  For my boyfriend and I, our check came out to being about  $75 for our two dishes, my two mango mimosas, his one mimosa and a glass of champagne and gratuity/taxes.  Considering some of the other available options, this just didn't seem worth it.  Good chance I won't end up back here in the near future.", "author": "Lisa I."}

But the asparagus salad was so delicious and the sauce was yummy!\n\n- Lamb Shoulder: I got to try some of this and it was really, really under seasoned. I think they forgot to add salt or something. Good dish just under seasoned.\n\n- Kobe Burger with Bleu Cheese: Pretty good and really big! I couldn't even finish it. Fries were okay, nothing spectacular.

Imagine my amazement when we arrived and saw that yes, there were people waiting, but there were also several tables inside open.  \n\nArmed with a reservation, I entered and asked about my reservation. With at least three empty tables in sight, a server told me to hold on and someone would seat me. 10 minutes later, with the tables no fuller than before, I approached another server about my reservation. Only then did they seat me at my table. \n\nWe ordered eggs benedict, smoked salmon benedict, and the wagyu kobe beef burger.  After ordering, we prepared ourselves for what we hoped would be a nice meal. We were startled out of our delusion by a loud THUD. This was the sound of the bread bowl and butter landing on our table as a member of the staff all but threw it on our table. \n\nThe eggs benedict were almost cold. They skimped severely on the Hollandaise sauce as well. The burger was OK but nothing special. I imagine it's not their wheelhouse, in any case.\n\nAfter we finished, we sat and chatted.  Or at least tried. The acoustics of the room made it such that we could hear conversations from people two tables down better than we could hear each other.  Meanwhile, there was no trace of our server or anybody else at all. No proffered refills of water or coffee, or even to offer us the check. \n\nFinally, our sever came around and ... took away an empty glass. No notice of the empty coffee cup, or the depleted food plates. You know what they say, out of sight, out of mind. Clearly my party was out of the staff's mind, as they did not bother to acknowledge our existence further until I left our table to bother the server about the check. \n\nIn sum, disappointing food + extremely inattentive service = a bad experience for us.", "author": "Gene C."}

I thought it would be more uppity and big, but it was a pretty small, intimate space that was about the size of a smaller end bar. \n\nThe asparagus frisee salad was delicious with a really nice dressing. \n\nThe braised lamb shoulder was so yummy! Perfectly seasoned and it went well with some potatoes on the side. The lamb had spent so much time braising that it was beyond melt-in-your-mouth.... it was basically melt-on-the-plate.

First of all, I've never had a hostess decide for me that I would be sitting outside in short sleeves and bare legs during the winter. How bizarre...second of all, once they sat us on the drafty patio, we had to ask for menus as well as water and bread. Anyway, the menu was fixed - four courses for $65, so we walked in there with low expectations - just happy to have good company and somewhere to accommodate our party. Turns out our expectations weren't low enough...we can't eat shellfish or escargot, and they were unwilling to simply substitute the lobster or escargot for the rice that was already on the menu, as our first course. Oh well. We figured we'd give it a shot, but like I said, we had low expectations to begin with. This didn't completely tick us off. Well, our friends ate the escargot I ordered for them and said they've had better many times before and that they're usually smaller in size...weird. The second course was a quail and spinach salad \"dressed with balsamic dressing.\" I could not taste balsamic anywhere in the soggy spinach salad and I could barely eat the quail. Maybe I swallowed one piece? The entree was a Beef Wellington...I've never had Beef Wellington before but I thought it was a safe bet considering it's filet mignon in a puff pastry. It had no flavor and the steak was NOT tender at all. The dessert was the most appetizing course of the whole meal but they took a chocolate lava cake (something that never disappoints) and infused it with a liquor (I think)...so instead of a delectable warm chocolate taste, it was sour. On top of all this, the patio cleared out as the evening went on and continued to get cooler and cooler. By the end of the night my toes were numb because they were so cold and it was not because I was in a dress with short sleeves and bare legs - my husband was fully clothed in jeans, shoes and socks, a long sleeved shirt, a jacket, and he was still cold. What a disappointment. I will never return to Chouquets and honestly do not understand how they remain open.

The ambience is nice, casual.. yet quaint.\n\nFor starters we had the carpaccio and the smoked trout with fingerling potatoes & mache salad.  The two appetizers were extremely light and consisted of more salad than the actual \"meatier\" ingredients.  Husband was disappointed with the carpaccio.. it was a very thin slice on the plate with a heaping shovel-ful of arugula on top.  He's a foodie nutt from France and he says he's NEVER seen it done like this.  Please don't call it carpaccio.. the other strange was that it come pomme frites.  What's up with that?  \n\nThe smoked trout salad was good.. no complaints there.  Husband also had half a dozen kumamoto oysters.  Very good, but also very petite.\n\nFor entrees, I had the seared ahi tuna, hubby had the Creekstone filet de beouf.. the kid had the vegetable gnocchi.\n\n-  The ahi tuna came out dry, overcooked and under seasoned.  Again, I had another shovelful of salad.  Can we lay off the greens please?\n-  The filet of beouf was done well.. came out with more pomme frites.. but all in all, the husband loved it.  BUT DAYAM was it microscopic in portions.  We are not heavy eaters.. but DOOD, we are not children either.\n-  The kid had the vegetable gnocchi \"with sage/lime infusion with asparagus, peas, baby leek, clamshell mushroom & crispy sage\".  By far, her dish was better than mine!  But alas, she is a dumb kid and they cannot appreciate complex tastes.. and so she would not eat her dinner.  We tasted it and then realized why.. it's because the gnocchi was undercooked (less than al dente), dry and pan-fried somehow.. it was crusty brown in some places.  The vegetables were good.. but that is not what makes the dish.\n\nWe skipped desserts at the end of the meal and headed over to Steps of Rome in North Beach.  And for a fraction of the price, had a wonderful dessert for each person, along with espresso.\n\nI'm not trying to be harsh here.. but it is one thing when you are charged big money for a great meal.. but $134 WITHOUT tip.. for food that misses more than it \"hits the mark\" and portions are somewhat small and super light.. it isn't worth it.. \n\nWait staff were very attentive and nice.  She was very pleasant and asked us how we were doing from to time to time.. \n\nAlso, not kid friendly (only because of the menu options.

As a nanny, I brought the baby with me once, and they refused to give me a table in the shade.  It was a blistering hot day, with 5 single tables in the sun, and 2 multi-person tables in the shade.  As well, these tables were farther apart and left room for the stroller to sit next to me.\nI understand that 4person tables are for 4 people.  However, they were nearly empty this afternoon.  When I asked for a shade table, I was told no.  I explained the stroller situation, and I was essentially told \"sucks to be you\".  I ended up seated about 3 ft away from a couple, with the stroller smooshed in-between us.  Uncomfortable and awkward much?  I'd say so.\n\nSo Chouquet...your food rocks, but work on the customer service please.", "author": "Anya W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-11-14", "description": "One of the reasons why I love Yelp! is because it helped me to better understand - and appreciate - this amazing city I happen to live in. San Francisco has a cosmopolitan nature, a remarkable tolerance for heterogeneity, and some of the best restaurants in the country.\n\nSometimes, however, even the best gastronomic experiences get misunderstood. \n\nI'll give you an example: Chouquet. \n\nAt the risk of over-simplifying the complexity of the innumerable reviews that are hosted on Yelp!, I would argue that they could all be divided into two categories: the enthusiastic ones, appreciative of both the food and the quality of the service offered by this tiny and charming French bistro. And those written by harsh critics who wholeheartedly disagree and seem to despise both. \n\nHow do you explain the apparent paradox, the love-or-hate relationship?\n \nOk, here's my theory, or, better, my story. \n\nI have been to Chouquet several times in the last three years and I adore it. I love it for the very same reason why most yelpers seem to hate it. \n\nWhereas some found the service slow, sluggish, and erratic, I consider it excellent. \n\nThis is probably because I am European, actually, Italian and this kind of service - not intrusive, hassle-free, discreet, is exactly what I look for when I dine out.  The waiting time between the courses is not \"excruciatingly long\", but just about right. I mean: eating is not a race, isn't it?\n\nOn the other hand, I can't stand the intrusiveness of most waiters in other restaurants. You see, in an Italian restaurant - and the same applies to France or Spain - when you get a table, you basically 'own' it for the rest of the night. Nobody is taking away your dishes when you are still \"working\" (LOL!) on them. You don't get the bill unless you ask for it. That would be an insufferable felony. \n\nAt Chouquet, the staff is usually very courteous and considerate. Not detached, but respectful of the customers' pace and desire to fully enjoy the social experience. \n\nThus, while I appreciate the American way (in Rome do as the Romans do, right?), I like the Mediterranean style - the slow food philosophy - better.\n\nHere's more contextual information that explains the five stars: Chouquet is where my friends and I engage in lively conversation about the film that we just saw or are about to see at Clay of Kabuki - in this sense, Chouquet is to Clay Theater what Globe is to the Embarcadero Center.\n\nThe culinary-cum-cinematic experience is a priceless pleasure: the two go together so perfectly. A glass of Bordeaux always makes the latest opus from Chabrol or Honore more palatable. We pretend we are critics from the 'Cahiers du Cinema' discussing things like 'mise-en-scene' and 'politique des auters'. It's San Francisco 2008, but it could easily be Paris, 1962.\n\nSure, the tables are so close to each other that sometimes it's hard not to eavesdrop on your neighbor's conversation. And just because the waiters are not pretending to worship the customers it does not mean that they are snooty or arrogant. They are just cool. You will find the same attitude in many European restaurants. In a sense, Chouquet is the real deal.\n\nIn short, this is an excellent place if you're on a date or with a group of friends who enjoy drinking, talking, and eating. And drinking. And talking. And eating. \n\nHowever, if you're in the hurry, you're definitely not going to like the experience. \n\nBut then again, what's the rush?", "author": "Matt B."}

But it could have been worse, the people next to us were served tea but no cups. And they still had no cups after asking once. Twice did the trick.\n\n- The facial expression on our waiter, Stephane, made it clear he did not like me at all as I requested egg whites and no oil in my omelet.

It's a small, intimate restaurant on charming Filmore street right in the heart of Pacific Heights.  The ambiance is warm and inviting, very cute!! The service was very good and our server was very attentive! After reviewing the full menu, we opted to pass on the 3 course tasting menu and go for items that weren't offered for DAT. \n\nWe started with the smoked trout with fingerling potatoes & mache salad.  It is a warm salad and had the most amazing flavors, I literally was scraping the bowl for every BITE! We were excited that the appetizer alone was impressive, the entrees MUST be nothing short of fantastic.  \n\nSure enough, Choquet's did not disappoint!  I had the rigatoni with truffles, chanterelles & foie gras.  All I can say is WOW! I've decided that truffles make every meal magical lol!  I ate each bite so slowly, savoring every taste sensation!!! Lily R. ordered the black risotto with scallops & laughing bird prawns vadouvan emulsion.  The unique spices and seasonings in this dish were incredible!!! \n\nBy this point we were stuffed and could not force ourselves to get dessert! (which is a great excuse to come back.....SOON!)

Another good 10-15 min go by and i had to flag the other waiter to let him know we had no bread or water or knives which i have to say he brought over very quickly after the fact. As far as the food, the trout salad was good but the gazpacho was too acidic. overall I was extremely not impressed by this place.

Our reservation was for 7:00 PM, and our table inside was ready immediately.\n\nI enjoyed the menu's variety, and Choquet's let two from our party split one Dine About Town meal at no extra charge.\n\nHere's what we got:\n\n- Soupe du jour, which was a creamed mixed vegetable\n- Crispy rolls of Baramundi with a ginger & coriander infusion (Tasty, but not out of this world, as they just tasted like greasy Chinese spring rolls to me....)\n\n---\n\n- Ahi Tuna Carpaccio with shoe string potatoes and mizuna salad (My friends said that the dressing over the salad was good but that the acid was overwhelming the taste of the tuna, and I agree. The tuna itself was perfectly prepared.)\n- 7-hour braised shoulder of lamb with truffled mashed potatoes (The lamb fell apart when I looked at it, and the mashed potatoes were creamy. Delicious.)\n\n---\n\n- Chocolate fondant with whipped cream (This is what it says on their current menu on their Web site, but it was more like a chocolate lava cake with ice cream and chocolate sauce. Warm chocolate oozed out of the center of the cake. This was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, and I usually always opt for the vanilla or fruit option.)\n- Apple tartin (Subtle flavor. In a dessert match, I felt that the chocolate fondant pummeled the apple tartin.)\n\nWe also ordered a bottle of \"Friendly Wine,\" which was the Argentinian Malbec. A little spicy, which we all enjoyed. Still easy to drink without overpowering the meal.\n\nOur server was attentive, yet also didn't make us feel rushed. Nice combination.\n\nI'd return, but only for another Dine About Town next year, as the prices are a bit steep if ordering all of the courses from the regular menu.", "author": "Wendy K."}

Although it's on the expensive side, the good-quality food, the pleasant ambiance, the tasteful decor, and the abounding natural light flooding in through the large street windows make this an ideal spot for a weekend brunch.

Perfect for before or after visiting Alta Plaza Park or the Fillmore shops... the lunch here has made me a lover of salads AND I highly recommend their goat cheese tart as well!!! SO GOOD. The creamy goat cheese, tomatoes, flaky crust, basil, and balsamic reduction make it an excellent dish worth savoring. \n\nThis place is great for a relaxed or romantic dinner. I occasionally enjoy a lovely dinner here, then take a leisurely stroll down Fillmore to the Kabuki theater for drinks and a movie. For dinner, I recommend trying a few of their appetizers. My new favorite is currently the beef tartar. It's fantastic. The burger is delicious and satisfying choice, though if you're feeling like ravioli... the mushroom ravioli dish is positively out of this world delicious.

The cafe was only half full and there seemed to be plenty of staff on hand.  When we realized that no one planned on helping us, we asked it we could seat ourselves.  Once seated, it took an inordinate amount of time to get water and menus.  Though the food was good, it was not special.  Think of any little French cafe in the city and there you have Chouquet's.  The worst part of the meal was waiting for the check.  I swear to you, two other parties were seated, ordered, and one of them was served before the bill arrived.  This was a service nightmare.  Bottom line, I am not opposed to enduring pain for great food.

The meat was very much in the French fashion of medium rare; very rare in the center, but truly delectable. The peppercorn sauce was truly amazing and likely had enough crack (aka butter), that I am now addicted.

I'll start out positive, the restaurant is cute and intimate and we were seated with no wait at all.  \n\nShortly after being seated the busboy accidentally spilled an entire glass of water into my lap.  I'm not talking a little bump and some water jumps out, I'm talking an ENTIRE glass of water right into the lap.  Completely soaking through my pants.   While an unfortunate event, this is not why I am writing a bad review of the restaurant.  The busboy was very apologetic, running back and forth to get towels, and even taking my coat to the back room to dry off.  I thought he handled the situation very well given the circumstance.  I mean, accidents happen to everyone.  It was the management that was so disappointing.  There were only two other people working in there (our waitress and someone i assumed to be the manager), and neither even looked up to acknowledge that I was soaking wet and freezing.  I mean, it's a small place, and it was definitely a noticeable accident...I screamed for god's sake, it was an entire glass of water down my front.  The manager did however seem to notice that my coat was back in their kitchen...I could see the busboy explaining what had happened and watched as they had an animated conversation about it.  You would think this would be a great time for the manager to come over to check on us or to ask if there was anything they could do.  They did NOT do any of this.  They completely ignored the whole thing.  When the huge bill came at the end of dinner, they had not even comped us a drink or dessert.  At the very least, that would have been the professional thing to do.  Nope, no acknowledgement at all.\n\nAnd since I've made an account just to write this review, I might as well comment on the food.  The onion soup and tuna tartare I thought were pretty good.  The entrees however, were very unimpressive.  The filet mignon was super raw, even though requested medium, and the pork special was extremely overcooked.  Overall it was unfortunate that we chose this restaurant and I won't be back.\n\nI really hope the nice man that spilt the glass of water doesn't get in trouble for this review.

The chocolate desserts were great, but the creme brulee was oddly watery--I probably wouldn't get that again.  \n\nAnyway, I just want to warn (and amuse) others regarding this totally insane and weird guy that sometimes hangs out at the bar there.  He harassed me for the entire 45 minutes it took me to have dinner (granted, I was dining alone, and obviously women who are alone are \"asking for it,\" right?  no).

I got the apple-tart instead, which wasn't bad, but I'm sure it would have been better with molten applesauce flowing from the center.\n\nSo I have to talk about the bathroom. Don't get me wrong, the bathroom was clean and smelled Glade-fresh. This is probably because the guy before me used the provided Glade spray to mask his lingering odor. I also think he, with good intentions, opened the very tiny window that faces Filmore street to air out the room. I noticed this as I was \"cranking out the juice.\" All the while, I wondered if it there was such a thing as a one-sided window screen. I was (un)lucky enough that I didn't need to find out since no one walked by. When I left the restaurant, I ran around on Filmore St just to find out, and the answer is no.

It was a full 3 course price fix dinner for $31.95. In all honestly, I was on a date when I came here so I was more focused on the conversation than the food. However, I do remember some of it though their online menu has changed so I cannot recall everything.\n\nATMOSPHERE:\nVery romantic. It is a small intimate place with dim lights. The location is great as it is on Fillmore street where many interesting shops are. Though, parking can be tricky.\n\nSERVICE:\nGood - nothing to complain about.\n\nMENU:\nIt looked good. Like many price fix menus, it wasn't a large menu, but had enough delicious choices to have you scratching your head.\n\nFOOD:\nMy date and I shared to optimize on the variety. For the first course, I got the ragout of veal sweetbreads (glands) with wild mushrooms. It had a very strong salty and organsy flavor and the balls (size and perhaps texture of testicles) were floating in a bed of thick sauce. It was good to sop up the sauce with the provided bread. My date had a multi-layered thing. I don't recall what the layers were but it was quite good.\n\nFor my main entree, I went with mussels which is one of my classic favorites. I cannot recall what my date had as I was clearly focusing on my mussels (cough) I mean his advice on getting a promotion.\n\nBy the time it was time for dessert, I was full. We peered at the table next to us and one woman had a strawberries and cream parfait. Being the sheep that I am, I followed suit. It was great - light and creamy and fresh. I forgot what my date had. \n\nApparently, as the meal went on, our sharing decreased. By dessert, we were hugging our plates.\n\nVALUE:\nI didn't pay so it's hard for me to say. It wasn't cheap though, so if I had paid, I may have felt a little gypped. Perhaps it was my choices - the sweetbreads being a little too salty and the mussels being too...easy. The dessert was easy too but tasted oh so good.\n\nOVERALL:\nRomantic restaurant so it's great for a date. The food is pretty good but not the best I've had for Dine About Town.  Interesting because their foods seemed to either be safe foods (mussels) or unique foods  (sweetbread).

I figured I should try it since it's in my neighborhood and I've tried just about every other place on Fillmore. \nI am a big sucker for brunch, LOVE Bloody Mary's and hopefully Eggs Benedict. I searched the brunch menu on-line and saw that Chouquets had both of my cravings so off we went! \nWe sat outside and the staff were kind enough to turn the heat lamps on since it wasn't exactly a warm morning. The waitstaff was friendly and no-fuss, our server appeared to be the only one in the entire place that morning (poor girl). \nI ordered the Omelette Paysanne with ham, gruy\u00e8re, & mushrooms and a Bloody Mary, my husband ordered the Smoked Salmon Benedict and a coffee. \nThe Bloody Mary was pretty good although I was really disappointed that it came with 2 little pickles and a piece of lemon instead of lime and celery. I realize they don't have a full bar so its neat that they are creative enough to find a way to make Bloody Marys (so essential to any \"brunch\"). The coffee was delicious- seriously, get the coffee. \nOur food came pretty quick, which surprised me, until I cut in to my omelet. I was severely disappointed. The omelet looked like a perfectly groomed egg omelet but once you cut in, all the filling came out- but it wasn't the ooey gooey filling that I was hoping for, it was almost not cooked. The ham and mushrooms were diced so small that I could barely eat them with my fork- and the topper was that the Gruyere wasn't even melted! It was grated cheese and you could see it on the inside of the omelet but it didn't' melt enough to hold the goodies inside. Really terrible, almost inedible. \nMy husband had the Smoked Salmon and the salmon was good- the Benedict as a whole was good but not great. It appeared that they make their own biscuits but they weren't my favorite. \nBoth of our dishes came with a salad that we both agreed was the best part of the meal- whatever dressing they are using is fantastic! But, again, the salad was mediocre, it was just greens- nothing else tossed with it. \nWhen you live on Fillmore, i don't see why you would go to Chouquets when you have SPQR, The Grove, and The Elite Cafe just down the street, same price range, and fantastic food.", "author": "Janell D."}

I had walked by this place lots of time in Fillmore and liked the cozy interior. Stepping in, you're greeted by a modern interior and  soft lighting. \n\nAlong with a bread basket, you're gifted with a yummy tomato caponata and garlic toasts.   I guess the caponata replaces the butter, and in this case, it did the trick.  The wine list is pretty extensive, covering many of the major wine regions in the world. My only complaint is that some of the more interesting sounding wines are only available by the bottle.\n\nMy dishes: \nAppetizer: Green Salad.  Portion-wise, it was largeish- more than I am accustomed to getting in most restaurants.  Simply dressed with a lemon vinagrette, it was tart without making my mouth too puckery.\n\nEntree: Millefeuille of Eggplant, Zucchini, and Chevre.  a WINNER. I found it well seasoned and again, quite filling.   I agree with the previous reviewer--not quite 100 slices, but preety damn good at about 7!\n\nEntree #2: Steak Frites.  My date's clean plate says it all!. The fries were crispy, lightly salted, and thoroughly addicting!\n\nDessert: Chocolate Fondant- crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside and real whipped cream to spoon on top.   This was the only course where the portion was small,  but between me and my date, I think it was just about enough to sate us and push us into pleasant food comas.\n\nExtras: With the bill, you get little yummy cookies--macaroons, I think.\n\nI would definitely go back here when I'm in the mood for a mellow meal--not a destination dinner, but one that folks who live within walking distance are lucky to have!", "author": "Smruti S."}

She said that I could go to their Web site to view the menu. First, that was the first I had heard about the prix fixe menu, which triples the cost of dinner. Second, the menu was NOT on the Web site as stated. Not knowing what we were going to eat, I had to cancel the reservation, and at that late date, where are you going to find a good meal.

It is very casual, with big windows and little wooden chairs with a lot of small tables for 2 people. The seafood dishes e.g. mussels, escargot, etc were lovely and the steak was divinely cooked, just until it was brown through but incredibly tender. The salads were very nicely done. The coffee was excellent quality and the wine list was small but solid. We did have a few tiny little quibbles which is why this didn't quite make 5 stars: a bit heavy on the salt on the green beans, and the french fries were mushy rather than crisp. The waitstaff was polite, helpful, friendly without being intrusive, and relatively prompt. They were nice about extra requests for napkins, extra plate, etc. This was an impulse last minute dinner plan and because of that we chose this previously unknown restaurant on opentable due to a 30% off coupon - which greatly increased the happiness factor. Would definitely go back.", "author": "p v."}

I dont know if it was because I had my bag of laundry or because I had jeans and a t-shirt on and the fact I ordered a virgin mary cocktail... maybe they thought i was a bum person or too young to know how to tip. Little did they know i've been a waitress, that I tip well for good food and good service, that ive been in the hospital for 2 weeks and that was my little 2 hour break Ive had to go do laundry and get lunch out of the hospital. I know the bag looked bad, but I saw they were quite busy, so I chose to sit at the bar to be out of the way as possible and not take up a table that could seat 2 + people. Is that not considerate? At first the cocktail lady was nice, I asked about the smoked trout and fingerling potatoe mache salad... I had to ask what mache was though :/ $14 for a bowl of salad :/ water glass went empty even though the cocktail lady was in front of me the entire time. Only once was I asked how it was. The other two waitresses ignored me. The guy serving food basically threw it in front of me. As I was eating looking around and seeing new people come saw they were getting bread and butter, noticed that I had a bread plate (next to me) when i sat down (I assumed it was for someone else, the waitress didnt even move it in front of me and I got my salad w/o utensils... big no no in my book) so i finish my salad, waited for the check. At this time I said, \"do you have to have a certain entree to get the bread?\" she then looks slightly embarassed and says, \"oh there wasnt any, but there should be now, do you want it to-go?\" \"hell yes\" thanks for almost letting me pay $14 for a salad that was, admittedly, good but not including the bread or even mentioning you were waiting for some, and for ignoring me practically the whole time. Only reason for 2 stars is because salad was good. Too bad for them I wont be back, nor will my family that stays with me and or visitors that come down to see me as I make routine trips to hospital.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-03-28", "description": "-THIS REVIEW IS FOR DINNER ONLY-\n\nI just got home from a dinner at Chouquet's and felt compelled to write about them- but not in a good way as you can see from my 2 star rating of them.  \n\nIt was my first time dining there and I had never heard of it before. My boyfriend made reservations for us as a surprise because he knows I love French food and wanted to try something new.  Unfortunately, he did not Yelp it beforehand and that was his first mistake!  We were late for our reservations but were able to get seated without much of a wait. We started with the soup du jour which was a lobster soup.  The soup arrived pretty quickly, and tasted exactly like the pureed tomalley  of crab or lobster.  Some people like that (I do) and others do not (like my bf).  It's an acquired taste but I thought it was a decent dish and worth the six dollars.  The main courses we ordered were the 7 hour lamb shoulder with the truffled mashed potatoes and the pasta with truffle, chanterelle mushrooms, and seared fois gras.  I ordered the pasta dish and when it arrived, I knew I had made a mistake.  I took one bite out of it and saw a pool of oil sitting on the bottom of the plate. The chanterelles were dry and shriveled- the fois gras over salted. Almost everything about the composition of this dish was wrong.  I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but I just couldn't.  My boyfriend felt bad so he offered to switch plates with me, but he couldn't even eat more than two bites.  I hate sending food back, but I felt like I really needed to tell them that this dish was inedible.  \n\nAfter getting a hold of one of the waitresses, we explained to her that we were unhappy with the dish and that it was swimming in oil.  I consider that unacceptable for a dish that costs 27 dollars.  My boyfriend politely explained the situation to which the waitress basically argued with him that it is the most popular dish there and that was exactly how it is supposed to be.  Then there was an awkward silence for about 1 minute during the time when we had expected her to offer a substitute (which became extremely uncomfortable). She rudely asked if we wanted something else and by then, we were already over the restaurant.   We told her that she could take it away anyway because there was no way any one of us was going to take another bite.  \n\nThe lamb dish wasn't so bad, but nothing memorable.  We ended up splitting that dish.  Then the male server came over after some mumbling with our server and the kitchen staff to explain the dish.  His explanation was that the oil we saw in the dish was the oil from the fois gras and it was supposed to be there.  I'm sorry but I don't see the need for 1/2 cup of extra oil to be sitting on the bottom of a plate. There was also no way that the fat came from the fois gras because it was only about 2 inches in diameter. Secondly, there are plenty of dishes that use  bacon or pancetta and even if some of the rendered fat is used in the dish, it is unlikely that there is any need to pour all of the fat into the dish.  I don't know a single person who thinks a pool of fat on the bottom of their food is a good thing.  Fat comes out of delicious things and helps flavor them- but we certainly don't need to drink the fat! \n\nWhatever the reason was, we just didn't like it and I just think the situation was handled poorly.  There was no reason for the servers to argue with us and tell us that it's normally a popular dish.  They could have simply apologized, taken the dish away and offered us something else.  The period between the initial complaint and the final offer to fix it just took too long.  \n\nIn the end, they didn't charge us for the pasta dish but I will most likely never return to this restaurant again. From now on, I'm completely banning any restaurant in the upper Fillmore area.", "author": "Jade L."}

Let me clear up some of the misunderstanding that is posted on Yelp. It is a small restaurant and things can take a little longer than expected. Sure your salad probably takes a little longer than expected. That is only one item from about 5 items you chose that night. What about the other 4 items and your friends food. Can it get a little cramp there? Sure, like I said before the restaurant is pretty small but they will try to seat you at a table, outside or at the door. The majority of the food has traces of Truffle oil, making your food jump with excitement (is it real truffle oil, I do not know, I do not care). All of the help at Chouquets can answer all of your questions, most of them with a French accent. Stop in, grab a Chouquet Drink or a Pilsner Urquell and be ready to eat some great French Food.

I just recieved an email from him (through YELP) calling me a fat CUN*, in French, of course. No wonder his food sucks so bad. He's got time on his hands to write nasty emails. I still stand by my review:\n\nShould it have been a sign that a sandwich board outside this restaurant was advertising \"diner\"? It's not that hard to spell 'dinner'. But we didn't see the sign on the way in. The food was awful. It was just one mis-hit after another. Our apps: Foie Gras, seared then chilled. OK, that's different. But it was slathered with Chinese Five spice that completely over-whelmed the flavor and nuance of the Foie Gras. They also did not take out all of the veins. This made me sad. Cured salmon served with warm potatoes and a truffle beurre blanc. It didn't work for me. I don't like luke-warm raw salmon sliced way too thick. It kind of grossed me out. My 'Crying Tiger' steak (menu did not specifiy what cut) was ordered medium-rare. It was cold in the middle, totally raw. Service was terrible. A busboy was trying really hard to take away my appetizer because the chef had obviously fired our dinners way too early. Eventually he brought our dinners out and placed them on the table next to us. Not kidding. The place was fairly empty so there is no excuse for the bad timing. The presentation was laughable. Our dinners both came with mashed potatoes that were thrown on the plate (think Jackson Pollack painting, with potato puree). Our wine glasses were empty when our dinner plates were put down. My husband just said it was the worst dinner he's had in San Francisco. One more observation. The people next to us ordered a butter lettuce salad. They were served the entire head of lettuce, in tact. It was funny watching them try to eat it. And then extract the core and put it aside.

The restaurant has a couple of things going for it.  They have a great location right on a busy corner of Fillmore and Washington and there is plenty of street parking nearby. They have a lot of windows for people watching, good light and a nice outdoor seating area. That's about it though.\n\nWe arrived and were seated immediately. Our waiter seemed lost and unresponsive to questions.  She took our order eventually after first taking the food order then coming back for the drinks order.  Bread was delivered but it took a while to get butter to go with it.  Now I must admit the drinks were great; the Bloody Mary and Anchor Steam beer are easily one of the best that I have had in the city and I eat out allot.   But that was where it ended.  3 of us ordered various omelet combinations and 1 ordered the Eggs Benedict.  The portions were small and all of the dishes were fairly bland and no better than what you would get in IHOP; the cheese tasted and looked like it was processed and the potatoes were under seasoned and soggy.  Here's the hard part to swallow, this place is by no means cheap.  An omelet is around $14.\n\nSo...mediocre (at best) food, uninspired service and dark ambiance led to an experience that we are not in a hurry to repeat.  I really wanted to like this place but it's a big miss...especially with their overinflated prices.", "author": "John R."}

The soup was rather tasteless -- I can't remember the last time I went to a nice-ish restaurant and had to add salt to my food. The salmon was very good -- a nice-sized portion, cooked to perfection, with a tasty sauce around it. The dessert was sub-par. We needed to ask for our water to be refilled -- in a restaurant with only ~15 tables, you'd think they'd have that covered. What really got my goat, though, was when we realized they were actually charging MORE for the \"Dine about Town\" prix fixe than their usual prix fixe. The waiter accidentally gave one of us the regular prix fixe menu when we were to decide on dessert. The menus were IDENTICAL, yet the prices were not -- $29 for the prix fixe usually, but $31.95 for the \"Dine about Town\" menu! Doesn't that defeat the purpose of \"Dine about Town?\" We pointed this out to the waiter and though he later brought us 2 complimentary glasses of champagne, we were still charged the $31.95 each.

Surely just a one time thing, so looked forward to my main entree. I ordered a vegetable gnocchi dish. Well, have you ever had an overcooked, beyond doughy and fried gnocchi? What was supposed to be a delicate gnocchi, tossed in a light sauce with vegetables turned into a dish that was \"burnt\" gnocchi, a sea of peas, some mushrooms, and a few asparagus tips. The waiter literally never checked back on us until the end and just threw a dessert menu before we received our check. The weird thing, is that when we got our bill, somehow the horrific gnocchi dish was taken off. So did they deliberately send out a bad dish, and hoped that I wouldn't complain? My husband ordered the filet mignon, and like most reviews, it was way undercooked and almost raw. Another weird thing, the steak is 4oz, and yet it was undercooked.

I had to ask the waitress what the other fish was.  I thought it might be herring (it was not pickled), but I was shocked when she said it was anchovy.  I was shocked only because the ones I have had in the past were very salty, but she said this is not salty because it is a fresh water anchovy.   Who Knew??  It also came with a crispy piece of bread with an olive tapenade.  This particular salad is very salty at times, so beware.  If you are not a \"salt\", you will probably send it back.  The only thing about this salad that I didn't care for was that it had parsley mixed in with it.

It was dry but tender (I know this sounds like an oxymoron) and under seasoned.  The lamb didn't taste like lamb AT ALL, except for the parts that were near chunks of fat.  The mashed potatoes with truffle oil were MUCH better; everyone at my table who either ordered it of tried it agreed.  The meal's saving grace was the chocolate fondant.  I was confused when I read this on the menu but from reading yelp review's before dinner, I guessed that this was the chocolate lava cake people were talking about.  THE CAKE IS REALLY GOOD.  If you are unfortunate enough to go to Chouquet's, just get the cake.  The cake cracked beautifully and the chocolate center flowed out and mixed with the vanilla ice cream to create an ending that just barely made the meal satisfactory.\n\nWhat made the whole experience even worse though, was the fact that the waitress miscounted the money we gave her.  We paid the majority of the bill in cash and the rest on one credit card.  She returned some 10 minutes later to tell us that we still owed around twenty-something dollars.  My friend and I went over the bill again and counted the money three more times and only found a $1 discrepancy so we threw in the extra dollar.  My friend brought the bill up to the cashier and told her that it was likely that they had counted the $50 as a $20 (although that doesn't make perfect sense either) but the waitress insisted that she hadn't miscounted and didn't apologize.\n\nThe general consensus between my friends and I was that if you must go here, use the restaurant.com coupon.  That's the only way it'd be even CLOSE to being worth the visit.  I'm giving two stars because the cake was VERY good and using the coupon made me feel better [I got it during one of their major discount sales].", "author": "Denise C."}

I am also European and often feel rushed at restaurants and find the service too intrusive.  I really don't like it when you are having a really great conversation with your friend and the waitor comes and interrupts you to ask how things are going, it is very annoying.  Whenever I feel rushed, I decide never to go to the restaurant again.  Also, I eat slowly, and I really don't like it when my plate is grabbed before I am finished (or, IMMEDIATELY after I have taken my last bite).  Eating out is not supposed to be another thing on your to do list which you have to check off asap.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised that at Chouquet's, the service was non intrusive, and they waited until we asked for the bill to give it to us.  The food was also really great, and the atmosphere was very cozy and inviting.  I will definitely be returning to this restaurant.", "author": "Fereshteh S."}

The wait staff were friendly and attentive unfortunately, there were only 2 of them for the whole place which slowed down service considerably and prolonged what would be a torturous evening. The decor of the place was rather simple and just didn't seem to impress me very much. First off, they gave us burnt bread, which I had to scrape off with my knife. For appetizers I got the trout salad and and fingerling potatoes - tasted really good unfortunately there was hardly any trout or potatoes in it. Girlfriend's seafood chowder was watery and not what I consider to be \"chowder\". For our entrees, we had the Kobe burger (good but nothing to write home about) which they messed up on by putting cheese which we didn't order and filet de boeuf (what a disaster). We ordered the filet medium, which they gave it to us well-done. We sent it back and got something on the order of rare, which we sent right back again, only to get something on the order of medium-rare (which was still too bloody). For dessert we had the chocolate fondant which was good, too bad it was too little too late and wasn't enough to save the entire meal/experience.

I loved the cozy atmosphere of the restaurant, the warm, lively feel inside and the glass windows to peer out on an adorable corner location. For my first meal I had the escargot in a pastry shell--I love escargot and it was nicely done! I was weary of the pastry shell but it was quite nice with the buttery sauce that went along with it. And if you didn't want the pastry--it was easy to pick out the escargot. For my main course I had the mussels which I LOVED. I finished every single mussel which says a lot because I feel like there are usually a few scrawny little guys in the mix that I am too afraid to eat. The buttery sauce was sooo yummy with the shallots! Exactly how I like mussels prepared. The French fries on the side were cooked perfectly too--thin but not too thin and seasoned just right. The cr\u00e8me brulee as a dessert was also quite delicious--all the desserts at our table looked yummy. Overall everyone at my table of 5 loved their meals, except one girl who ordered the salmon which came out a little bit undercooked.  Really my only complaint is that our wine was literally almost hot. We ordered two bottles of red and I know it doesn't have to be refrigerated but it was just too warm. Other than that, amazing meal! I was especially impressed by our tres francaise waitress--she had the whole place to herself and she still managed to also play hostess. Mad props to her.

It wasn't the best duck dish I had; it was overcooked alittle too much, i like it with more pink.  and the skin wasn't seared enough to give it the crispy finish.  The veal carpaccio was just thinly sliced meat served with a sauce made with i think just oil, scallion and some other herbs.

The food is slightly to the lighter side of classical Loire cuisine, emphasizing mostly seafood and fowl, but they also provide the heart-clogging staples of Steakfrites, Beef Carpaccio, and Veal Sweetbreads.  My Millefeullie of Eggplant, Zucchini, and Goat Cheese was quite tasty even though it featured far fewer than the 1000 slices of eggplant I had been promised.

This weekend provided such an occasion since I was entertaining a friend from out of town and giving her a taste of No Cal living.  I like the interior of the place, and it's much roomier than many of the bistros that I've been to around town.  Although, our table was just close enough to the next that I could hear the man bitching about the size of the burger.  Or the lack of size.  And that for the price he was going to have to go somewhere else afterwards to eat something else.  He didn't really look like he was going to be malnourished anytime soon, perhaps next year and he was getting quite obnoxious.  The wait staff didn't seem to care all that much.  My friend had ordered the Niman Ranch burger, and she was quite pleased with it.  Perfect dimension that didn't weigh her down too much.  I ordered the salmon with salad, and it was perfect.  More salmon than I could handle and the toasted bread and cream cheese hit the spot.  However, I didn't really care for the dressing on the greens...but I would let that slide.

Either the manager, chef, server or all of the above! must have had a big night out on Halloween as both the food preparation and service were extremely disappointing. \n\nHere is the list of reasons not to go back (in the order that they occurred):\n1) We were seated outside on the sidewalk and ordered before several other groups arrived, yet we were the last ones to receive our food while 5 other tables were served ahead of us ordering similar dishes.\n2) The waitress moved two guests to another table as she informed them that \"that\" table was reserved for her boyfriend - a nonpaying customer, WTF?!?\n3) The same waitress waited on her boyfriend while paying little attention to the other guests.\n4) Our food came out and one of the plates we ordered was Eggs Florentine - since when does Eggs Florentine come with gravy instead of hollandaise???? My girlfriend insisted it was no big deal but I insisted they take it back and remove it from our bill. The server tried to argue that it was hollandaise but when I told her to go ahead and try it and tell me what she thought it was she reluctantly took away the plate.\n5) Another server brought us an order of french fries that we didn't order but we thought maybe they came with one of our lunches. We ate some and then he came back 5 minutes later and took them from us and said they were for the table next to us. He then put those same french fries that we had been eating on their table. Understandably, the table next to us did not want the food that we had been eating. So he moved them back to our table BUT added it to our bill.\n\nOverall, this was a very disappointing experience and with so many great options in SF for brunch, don't let the charming sidewalk cafe and cool music sway you into spending your money here.

Liked the name and decided to try it.  So disappointed.  My drink (coffee) was brought to me quickly but waited a long time for the entree, salmon. This was a narrow slice approx. 1.25\" x 4.75\" on a bed of mashed potatoes with peas&carrots. Uninspiring, less than generous but tasty because of the seasoned potatoes the salmon sat upon. Not worth $22.00.  It was salmon not halibut!  Should not have been more than $16-18. Bread basket was not brought until the time of the main course. 3 tiny slices of bread. Water was not brought till the end of the main course. I hadn't asked for it but wondered where it was all meal long.  Wondered if this was an attempt to clear my palate for dessert which they hoped I'd order. Service was as you can imagine slow.  Pleasant young girl but clearly disorganized and not a seasoned waiter. Will not be returning to this one.  So many other french bistros out there. With coffee and tax 26.83.  Way not worth it.", "author": "Anne N."}

First, my girlfriend and I had a lunch reservation here.  It was my birthday!  The morning started out fantastic with a mani/pedi at Le Creme....wonderful!  Then off to Chouquets for a relaxing lunch and girl talk.  It was a very cold day and had rained too.  The temp outside was 41 and when we were seated it was about the same temp inside!  Other customers (only 3) were having lunch with their coats on!  As we sat at our table I said, \"its so cold in here\".  The \"gentleman\" said....\"well, its cold outside too\".  WHAT?  The ad in Yelp & Open Table says the \"warm dining room\".  YIKES!  It was not warm at all!  No heat and a very very rude person to boot.  I kindly said that its too cold to enjoy our lunch and that we were leaving.  OWNERS:  Please make your paying guests comfortable.  Guests will come back if the food is good and they have a nice dining experience.  Really...do you stay in a store or place of business longer than you have to when its absolutely freezing?  How about lunch or dinner in 41 degrees?  Too many \"other\" great places to eat with heat.   Due to the response we had, we will never eat here.  Never.", "author": "MELANIE W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2005-07-07", "description": "Location: A+ (On the corner right before Fillmore gets all Union-y but still up below Tully's and Jackson Fillmore, so there is always a bit of people watching traffic). Decor: A (for such a small space, they've actually done a lot - very European with the inside tables crammed sort of ass to elbows - *great* eavesdropping opportunities) Ambience: A- (I think it's still neighborhood-y so it's a combination of Clay Street theater goers, Pac Heights non-interest-only home owners, and interested passers-by-- a nice, albeit eclectic, mix). Food: B+ Definitely loved the frites (especially because they're called Frites!), but, as with most French places, they are woefully slim on the vegetarian options, with not so much as a listed entree for the carnivorously challenged.  The chef did say he could do something for me, which wasn't half bad, but on principle I can't say that it's a great veg dining option...brunch might be better...", "author": "Anjali K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-04-13", "description": "We brought a friend here for Sunday brunch and I haven't been this disappointed in the service of a restaurant in a very long time. They seemed annoyed as soon as we arrived, the snobby hostess reluctantly sat us at a dirty table. No one brought waters or silverware. After asking twice and not receiving the water, I got up to get it myself from the bar. I had to literally walk up to the waiter and ask him to take our drink order 20 minutes later. Clearly, he was really busy flirting and pulling up his shirt for another customer to see his hairy belly and didn't have the time. It took forever for him to come over to take our food order & then he forgot the third person's order. He never came back to check on us or how  our meal was once and no, we never got refills on our water either. Saying that the service sucked at this place is an understatement & it really put a damper on what was supposed to be a relaxing Sunday brunch. We left the loser waiter a 12 cent tip and that was ONLY because we didn't have exact change.", "author": "Mariam M."}
