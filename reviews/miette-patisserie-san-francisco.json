However, this Ferry Building outpost is convenient to the Yelp office and our hotel which makes it an easy stop to stock up on candies and baked goods, even if I only have a sliver of time. They're a small location so they don't quite have the same imported candy stock as Hayes Valley but if you want their house-made treats and sweets, it's the perfect place to pop in for a bit. \n\nMust tries: the chocolate sea-salt caramels, the lavender shortbread (my husband's favorite), the cupcakes (any will do, they're all great!), and the chocolate wafer cookies (my absolutely favorite. I make them often at home since the recipe is in their cookbook but nothing beats the ones they make themselves). \n\nThere's also plenty in the Ferry Building to peruse so come here for a meal and enjoy some dessert or take home treats from Miette!", "author": "Annette J."}

French style pastries, decadent cakes and tons of cute little candies.  Perfect for that afternoon sweet tooth.\n\nEclair: Firm and chewy choux pastry shell.  Rich vanilla custard inside.  Just the right ratio so there's enough but not so much it squirts everywhere.  And a bitter chocolate glaze to contrast the choux and the custard.\n\nScharffen Berger Mini-Cake: It's basically like eating a mound of chocolate ganache that happens to have a little cake underneath.  Like 3x richer than normal chocolate frosting.  The chocolate cake underneath is not bad either.  Kinda of the devils food variety.  Super indulgent.\n\nChocolate Cupcake w/ Italian Meringue: The meringue frosting looks mesmerizing.  Like it's some sort of huge marshmallow, but with a less sticky mouthfeel.  A generous heap to pair with the normal sized chocolate cupcake underneath.  Feels so much more decadent than the common buttercream frosting alternative.\n\nWalnut Brownie: Just as brownie should be.  Crispy edges on all sides.  Chewy and gooey on the inside.  A very thin flaky top layer.  And just enough walnuts to add texture but not overwhelm; the small chop was perfect.\n\nPot De Cr\u00e8me: Like pudding but thicker and $5 for 3 small spoonfuls.

I'd never walked down the length of the ferry building before. Lots of sweet treats on the left side! Humphrey Slocombe's ice cream (with its line) plus a soft serve place right next door.\n\nI opted for an 8 piece box of macarons. No artificial colorings whatsoever, not even a tint of green for pistachio. All natural ingredients. How does one differentiate between flavors? 8 flavors available on the daily. I took photos of the glass jars and the employee put them into the box in that order. So far I've tried hazelnut, strawberry, and vanilla. The former was just right. Soft, coarsely ground nutty shell for texture, and a simple smattering of thickened hazelnut cream. I didn't realize a majority of the macarons would be filled with buttercream, as was the case with the latter treats. Picking up the strawberry Macaron from the box caused the two shells to slide a bit. No pink tinge there. The vanilla was chewier than the other two! Pleasantly surprised.\n\nFlavors available on 6/24/17:\n\nChocolate\nVanilla\nHazelnut\nStrawberry\nRose-geranium\nChocolate Lavender\nDulce de Leche\nPistachio\n\nFound palm sized bags of strawberry Turkish delight to take home.

I've tried their other cookies, and of course they've been buttery and delicious and very subtly sweet (in a good way), but the hands down best is the Lavender Shortbread! \n\nThe Lavender Shortbread Cookies are light and buttery, with the lavender flavor hitting you in waves of crunchiness. Unlike other shortbread cookies, it's not too sweet and not too buttery - making it easy to keep munching until you realize you're covered in crumbs and are now holding an empty bag of cookies... \n\nNeedless to say, I love these cookies and I have to get them every time I'm at the Ferry Building. They're $7 for a bag... but can you really put a price on happiness? \n\nPro tip: They also offer samples of some of their cookies - just ask the staff behind the counter! You don't really get a choice in the flavors because they offer you what has already been opened, but it's delicious and free nonetheless, so definitely take advantage of it!!", "author": "Joyce W."}

The pastel green and pink shelves hold an array of shortbread, meringues, macarons, and other confections. They even sell pastel cake stands. There's also a small fridge that holds ice cream sandwiches.\n\nI was attracted to the simplicity of their cakes, with just layers of cake and creamy frosting, with minimal frou-frou decorations. The packaging, on the other hand, is very flowery and cutesy.\n\nMost cakes are about $30 - $40 for around 6-7 inches. I've never had cake here, but I have tried the Old-Fashioned in cupcake form. Cupcakes are $3.25 each, which is on par with the cost of most cupcakes, but theirs seem a little on the small side. \n\nThe Old-Fashioned is chocolate cake with marshmallowy icing. The chocolate cake is rich and moist. I didn't really like this particular icing and I think icing is what makes the cupcake. The main feature is actually the single peanut on top, covered in red candy coating. It reminds me of one of my favorite candies, peanut M&M's. \n\nAbove the cake display are several glass jars, filled with macarons. Each is around $2.50 and a box of 6 is $14. These macarons are quite good for a place that doesn't mainly specialize in macarons. They're actually pretty light and delicate. I quite like the hazelnut flavor. The exterior crumbles easily upon biting into them, but the interior is somewhat chewy.\n\nIt doesn't look like they sell macarOONs, which are more like coconut covered biscuits. \n\nI'll have to return to Miette the next time I'm in the Ferry Building with a sweet tooth, and check out what else they offer.", "author": "Joy W."}

It is conveniently located inside the Ferry building, so you can walk from the tram or the BART. As for the hours, well I wish they were open a bit longer but understandable considering the Ferry a Building does close early. Don't expect mall hours, it's not happening. So if you plan on visiting Miette do it before dinner.\n\nWe've tried the macarons, candy bars and a few of their cakes. My favorite has to be the coconut hot milk cake (coconut creme cake). The size is generous and has the right amounts of cake, creme and coconut. At other places, the same type of cake can have too much cake and can leave your mouth dry. This was perfect!\n\nThe macarons are nice too. My favorite is the ginger. I like the bite of the ginger along with the sweetness. Their candy bars are high quality too, the presentation in the cute wrapper is what urged me to buy it. A couple of the bars would make nice gifts too, I know I would like to be gifted with a few. ;)\n\nMiette also has a cookbook, if you didn't know.

Especially from here it is one of my go-to places when I'm in town. Have to, have to, have to get this! \n\nWhat I like about this place is they don't have to please us with the prettiness of the food coloring for each flavor. It does well without it. The natural colors of the almond-based cookie part defines the macaroon along with its respectable and presentable shape and texture. As you take a small bite into the macaroon the softness and chewiness density sinks into your teeth and the center filling slightly oozes out but stays in tact. This completes the taste for an amazing sought after macaroon. This time around they had chocolate lavender, green tea, rose germanium, vanilla, strawberry, dulce de leche, hazelnut, and pistachio flavors.  \n\nOn this trip I bought a chocolate lavender and green tea for $1.85 a piece. That was not enough for me!! On the last day of my trip in the city I had to buy at least a small box full. For a small dark chocolate color box of 8 they offer to wrap it in packaging string and patched it with a Miette sticker.  The 8 macaroons were devoured within a 2 days stretch but definitely eat it on the day of so that the you'll enjoy the freshness. \n\nMiette also sells little cute cakes, cupcakes, cookies, and other sorts.

I came to Miette with the intention to buy macarons and even though the lack of color in all of the different flavors was off-putting, I still bought 6 just to try. The girls behind the counter were pretty helpful, but seemed to be in a hurry to finish helping me. They packaged the macarons in a small Asian to-go box - each macaron was $1.75 I believe. \n\nSo I believe that all of Miette's macarons contain the same flavored shell with the inside filling being different. The shell didn't have much taste at all, and the only flavor I liked was rose. Chocolate, hazelnut, pistachio, green tea were too sweet and didn't taste very good while the last flavor wasn't memorable at all. The filling for rose was great and captured that flowery essence without being too overpowering; however, the shell lacked flavor and was much too crumbly for me. \n\nI don't think I'd recommend this place for macarons unless you really like rose macarons.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-12-30", "description": "You know, I see all these reviews on their macarons and everyone has a completely different opinion--some say it's too sweet, some say it's too light, and some straight up say they don't like desserts PERIOD! I'll take the goldilocks stance and say it was juuuuuust right:\n\nRose Geranium: This was my favorite--many rave about this, and rightfully so. The geranium adds a slightly different floral flavor to the macaron that complements and works so well with the rose--I would've never guessed! A must try, if you just had to try one.\n\nPistachio: This was a fail for me, as I am accustomed to making my own macarons and I make my pistachio ones with pistachio flour/meal. These fell a bit short for me as the shell was still the usual almond (I can't complain as most macaron places do the same), but I don't think there was enough taste in the filling to fully enjoy the pistachio flavor. Perhaps roasting the pistachio may help, or making the feeling less heavy/creamy?\n\nCaramel: This was my boyfriend's favorite. The caramel flavor is very \"in your face\" and a stark contrast from their lighter fillings. Heavy and bold, the caramel pretty much announces \"IM HERE!\" whether you like it or not. If you love caramel and rich flavors, this is the one for you.\n\nChocolate Mint: This tasted like a mint fudge brownie. I don't know what else to say; it was good, but not OMG MUST TRY.\n\nOverall, the shell of the macarons are softer and more \"cake\"y than I am accustomed to, and it created a fudgy texture once eaten with the filling. This makes for a lovely chocolate macaron, as you're pretty much eating a fudge brownie, but could be strange for the flavors that need a bit more texture, like pistachio. The filling in general veers towards the creamier side, giving your mouth an aftertaste of rich cream/whole milk. I certainly didn't mind, but I can see how it might be off putting for those who want the lighter taste.

Mint green and pale pink accented with marble really just make you want to shop for delicate sweets, no? \n\nI was in a little bit of a hurry to go back and pick up a dinner order I had placed at another vendor but since it seemed as though it was nearing closing time for quite a few of the businesses in the Marketplace, I figured I could sneak just a few storefronts over as I waited so as to see what I could see. I wasn't rushed in a sense that I was expecting to be helped at Miette right away, but in a way that I knew my food wouldn't be ready immediately yet I still wanted to get back to it in a timely manner. I had picked up a small tube of their Rose-Geranium meringues, but when I saw that both employees were helping other guests for extended periods of time, I had to put them down and walk away.\n\nAfter I got my food and there was still about 15 minutes until the shops closed, I headed back, picked up the same tube of meringues and grabbed a few more goodies. I didn't really know what I wanted so because everything looked good I grabbed some sea salted caramels and raspberry flavored mini-hearts and I was on my way. The service I received wasn't overly quick or friendly, but at least I got to give them some money in exchange for sweet treats!

There are many different things to purchase here such as marshmallows, cookies, macarons, etc. There are also cards and mini cards here for you to purchase and use as a gift.\n\nThis review is only for the macarons as I have only ate the macarons. Coming from Toronto region, I've tried a lot of delicious macarons, though I still believe Laduree is the best.\n\nAlthough the macarons didn't taste like they came out from the fridge and they were pretty cheap: $1.65 each, the taste and flavour was lacking a lot. First off, biting into the macaron shell, it didn't have the crisp texture of the macaron shell. The almond flour was extremely rough, so rough that I could feel the almond grind and flour. I have purchased eight macarons, 7 flavours: hazelnut, chocolate lavender, green tea, pistachio, vanilla, rose and dulce le leche. The shells of all the macarons were very similar in taste and were all similar in colour (glad to know that not much food colouring is added), but disappointing to know that they all tasted so similar. \n\nI would say for macarons, 70% of the \"mark\" i would give the macaron normally goes to the shell as it is so hard to make well - the almond flour, the aging of the egg whites, whipping it up, etc. \n\nNext, the filling. I was very dissapointed in this filling as well. The filling was not smooth and it was not creamy enough. Furthermore, I couldn't really taste the flavour of the filling, all of the macaron fillings tasted fairly similar.\n\nI would love to give some other desserts a try, but I would not recommend this place for macarons.", "author": "Kristy N."}

Most of the flavors are chocolate-based--I highly recommend either the hazelnut or pistachio. I've also tried the buttermilk panna cotta, which was very tasty. It comes in a cute little mason jar, and is filled to the top with fresh strawberries. It's the perfect sized desert. I'm definitely going to try some of the other desserts in the shop.\n \nAgain, the price at Miette are on the steeper side, but that's expected of a shop located inside the Ferry Building.

I'll admit that I was drawn to the cute confectionary look of this store. Once I saw hundreds of macarons stacked in apothecary jars, I knew I had to take a look. These macaron looked like they were made with great technique because the \"feet\" of the macaron were perfect.\n\nEven though I only intended to have one, I ended up buying a dulce de leche macaron and a rose geranium macaron. There were plenty of other tempting flavors like hazelnut, raspberry, and coffee but I had to draw the line somewhere. The shelves of the store were filled with delicate desserts like lemon loaves and gum-balls decorated as tennis balls. \n\nThe macarons were probably some of the best I've ever tasted. I'm a HUGE fan of Laduree and Lette but I think that Miette beats them by a smidgen. The dulce de leche was absolute perfect- sweet and slightly salty filling sandwiched between two perfect ends. The actual macaron had the exact texture that a macaron should have- delicate at first touch and slightly chewy upon biting into it. The rose geranium lived up to the hype that the saleswoman claimed it had. The macaron had a floral perfume and many layers of flavor. Although the flavor seemed subtle, I really enjoyed it. \n\nAt $1.85 per macaron they aren't cheap, but this is a standard price for a macaron. The actual size is a generous for a macaron and the flavors are great. I think Miette is a very charming shop that I will definitely return to.

Of the 3, I might get the Mini Scharffen Berger Cake again as I'm always a fan of chocolate on chocolate.\n\nAnd then onto the macarons... As someone who lives + works a stone's throw away from both 'Lette + the well-known Bottega Louie in Downtown LA, I've unfortunately developed a fairly high standards for macarons... their perfectly uniform shape, brightly enticing colors, tantalizing selection of flavors, the delicate crunch of the shell followed by the chewy consistency almost melting with the cream filling in your mouth...

I suppose there is something honorable that could be said about their unique composition (of ground-almond meringue cookies) or that they proudly do not contain food coloring... but at the same time, it's admittedly much harder to get excited about spending $1.85 a pop when the texture is just so... unrefined, for lack of a better word.\n\nOverall... cute shop, pretty sweets for the eyes, average taste on the tongue...

Visually it's hard to tell them apart, but one bite will have you know that they are labeled differently for a reason. \n\nThe grapefruit reminded me of orange more than an orange cream could ever hope to remind me of an actual orange. It was fruity without the tanginess of a citric fruit.\n\nThe Rose had a nice sweet essence but I couldn't put a finger on it while munching on it seeing how I had forgotten which flavors I'd purchased; which is a pretty good way of putting the taste to the test.\n\nLastly, I had the trusty pistachio macaron which didn't let me down, as usual. It was still just as delectable as the day I first had it.\n\nYes, the macarons are solid (figuratively)!!!\n\n\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u20ac\u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\u00a5\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\u00a3\n\nMany winters ago, I was of the opinion that Miette created overrated and terribly expensive cupcakes. Well, they still make pretty expensive cupcakes but I'm glad to find that their repertoire had expanded (and thank God for that!) greatly.\n\nAfter putting in my order for a Bluebottle latte next door, I hurried over to satisfy my treacly-tooth (\"sweet tooth\" would be an understatement).\n\nAnd this time I decided to go for the chocolate ganache tart and a couple of macarons --- a hazelnut, and a pistachio. \n\nThe tart's chocolate ganache filling was silky smooth and just plain amazing! I had always loved ganache tarts but this pushed the bar that little bit higher! The flaky base had just the right amount of crunch and the right bit of crumble. And that sprinkling of sea salt on it is not just there to be a pretty wallflower. It truly served to open up the taste buds and greatly enhanced the intensity of the ganache as it melted its unctuous richness inside your mouth, caressing your smooch-thruster.\n\nThough I must admit I haven't had all that many macarons and hence can't claim to be a connoisseur, I do know what tastes good when it lands on my taste buds. And the macarons were delicious! They were airy, light, and oh-so-slightly chewy. In fact, I preferred these over their much vaunted counterparts at the Bouchon Bakery in Yountville; those had too many hollow pockets in them.\n\nI highly recommend both the macarons and the tart.

Decorated with lots of pink, fancy containers and a display case of cupcakes, this place certainly looked well put together. \n\nSo I did some research and found that Miette is a popular patisserie with its main storefront in Hayes Valley. It's claim to fame is that Food Network named it as having the best cupcake in america in its Gingerbread cupcake.\n\nTaking home a box of four of these gingerbread cupcakes, I also grabbed a container of their gingersnap cookies and a creme fraiche ice cream sandwich.\n\nGingerbread cupcakes - These were very good, although I don't know about it being the best cupcake in america. Everything about it was definitely of quality though. The frosting was creamy while not being too heavy or buttery. The cupcake had a nice gingerbread taste to it as well. The best part was the consistency, which was extremely moist and soft.\n\nGingersnap cookies - These were a little disappointing, given that their label advertises these as making it on some top SF list as well. The texture felt like it was trying to be both chewy and crispy while not really pulling off either.\n\nCreme Fraiche Ice Cream Sandwich - This was surprisingly good. I got this as an impulse buy, having come here for only the cupcakes. The cookies were graham cracker and the ice cream was so creamy yet firm that this was one of the better ice cream sandwiches I've had. \n\nI don't know that I would come back again, but I did enjoy it.", "author": "Mark O."}

Miette means \"little crumb\" in French.  It's a small, European-inspired pastry shop that opened in 2001.  The storefront is simple and elegant with cakes, cupcakes, cookies, macarons, and other delightful confections on display.  Packaging and presentation is nice.  Cakes and cupcakes are on display behind crystal clear glass display cases, cookies are neatly stacked on a table out front, and macarons are stored in glass jars.\n\nWe ordered one of every macaron they had available that day.  The macaron flavors were:\n\n- Chocolate Orange\n- Vanilla\n- Rose Geranium\n- Pistachio\n- Hazelnut\n- Grapefruit\n- Chocolate\n\nThey weren't exactly cheap at $1.85 a pop, but expectations were high given the looks of the macarons, the store, and where we were (the culinary destination that is the Ferry Building).  The quality was indeed superb.  The macarons were made out of coursely-ground almond meringue cookies and filled with a buttercream or ganache.\n\nThey were delicious.  I enjoyed all the flavors except for the Rose Geranium.  This is a personal preference, but they were too flowery in taste for me.  Regardless of flavor, each macaron was simple, rich, and delicate.  I could tell the pieces were fresh.  They were slightly moist and easily melted in my mouth.  Each bite was a bite of joy.  That is the sign of an excellent macaron!\n\nSo, I recommend Miette and look forward to trying one of their cakes, cupcakes, and/or cookies during one of my future visits to San Francisco.", "author": "Daniel B."}

We paid for them and even called them a few days in advance to confirm. \n\nHowever, when we arrived at our wedding reception, only 1 of the cakes had been delivered. Miette was closed and not answering their phones. The restaurant sprang into action and whipped up some extra desserts (thanks, Epic Roasthouse!).

I have to admit that she was quite chipper as she admitted they never made 2 out of the 3 cakes. Whoopsie! She said that she could refund the money for the 2 missing cakes \"as a courtesy.\" Her call was to process the refund for the 2 cakes that never arrived. Otherwise, she did not seem the least bit concerned, and after that nobody ever followed up with us to try and make things right. \n\nC'mon, Miette. Refund the delivery fee, give us a store credit, or even take 3 minutes to send us a handwritten note. \n\nBut here's the thing- they are apparently doing so well that they really don't need our business and they really don't care whether or not we trusted our special day to them and they blew it. Oh well. We learned that the hard way. \n\nSo. They make delicious, attractive baked goods. But I wouldn't count on them to carry through on something important.

During each visit, I've definitely taken notice of the macarons but was never inclined to try it because I'm one of those people who truely eats with their eyes. You see, their macarons don't look like your traditional colorful yet light looking patties. The neutrality in color in combination with the visibility of almond meal conveys a heavier pastry feel, which is why I never bothered to try it.

I ended up getting the Rose-Geranium, which I was told to be most fragrant in taste, which it most definitely had. What I liked about the macaron was that the texture is different than your average macaron. It's a bit \"cakey-er\" and chewier than your typical macaron yet its still relatively light. It feels much more filling than your typical macaron as well. What I liked was the lightness and cool temperature of the cream, which was a great contrast to the\"buns\".

I've tried macarons from several other bakeries (Chantal Guillon, L'Artisan, Satura Cakes, La Maison du Chocolat, Oui Oui, La Baguette to name a few), but I do not recall any of the macarons having flecks of almond skin or this amazingly chewy texture. The staff is always super nice and they ask \"eco-friendly green\"questions, like whether or not I need to have my little waxed paper envelope sealed with a sticker. \"No need, I'm going to  eat them RIGHT NOW.\"  Ha ha. I love Miette's French macarons like a kid-with-a-weight-problem loves cake.\n\nFlavors I've tried: \nRose Geranium\nVanilla\nPistachio\nGrapefruit\nChocolate Hazelnut\nChocolate Orange\n\nMiette's talented team of macaron-artisans know their craft LIKE A BOSS.\n\nTip: $5 minimum credit card purchase. Macarons are $1.85 each.", "author": "Liv K."}

I chose the pumpkin, the hazelnut, and the chocolate. These were unlike macaroons I've had before because I thought I was eating more of a sandwich cookie like an oreo rather than a macaroon. In fact, I am pretty sure these should be marketed as sandwich cookies instead of macaroons because nothing about their taste resembles a traditional macaroon. The filing inside is more like frosting than meringue. So as sandwich cookies, the pumpkin and the hazelnut were good. The chocolate was bitter and blah.

This time though, I liked one out of the three macarons I decided to get, so overall I wasn't super impressed. \n\nI came here on a whim towards closing time on Friday evening, and I did appreciate the fact that they were well-stocked in tasty treats (personal pet peeve of mine is when little shops run out of goodies towards closing time). It's a cute little stand in San Francisco's famous Ferry Building, and there were two ladies behind the counter. Both seemed a little tired and lackluster, for lack of a better word. They weren't unpleasant, but they weren't actually friendly either. \n\nMacarons: rose geranium, pistachio, and grapefruit:\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/miette-patisserie-san-francisco?select=ssJ6fgc33H3UBuD8gqZaWQ#Wx-9naTKYxF1iSJw0MAXPg)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/miette-patisserie-san-francisco?select=ssJ6fgc33H3UBuD8gqZaWQ#j70bQbN9ZOTyqUUrtYXvog)\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/miette-patisserie-san-francisco?select=ssJ6fgc33H3UBuD8gqZaWQ#BNmi5ibAuKHxzP-zcfgUUA)\nAs you can see from the pictures, these macarons all look generally the same upon first glance. I was a little mystified at first, since I'm used to macarons looking vibrant and colorful, but I can also appreciate the lack of artificial food coloring and in-your-face tie-die rainbows. They're a little hard to tell apart though, especially as they were all packaged in the same bag for later enjoyment. I had to employ the taste-and-tell method, as the cream in the middle all looked pretty much the same as well..\n\nI think my favorite was definitely the pistachio, as it tasted the most natural yet true of all three flavors. The rose geranium was very floral, and I thought the balance of rose and geranium was done pretty well, but the whole thing just tasted a little too.. floral to me. I know it's supposed to, but maybe there was a tad too much extract in there? The grapefruit was probably my least favorite, which was a disappointment since it was my friend's favorite. I just thought the artificial grapefruit flavor was much too obvious, and there wasn't a real balance between the extract-y taste and the sweetness. \n\nI appreciated the generous amount of filling in between the macarons; this isn't one of those places that skimps on the cream, so you can definitely taste the velvety texture when you bite down. And contrary to some of the other reviews, I rather liked the semi-gritty texture of the macarons themselves, and I thought it had a good initial crunch before delving into the chewiness of the macaron shell center. \n\nI think the overall monotone appearance of the macarons takes a little bit to get used to, and I'd like to try some other flavors next time. I liked Miette, but I'm a little on the fence about whether I'd return specifically.. maybe for an ice cream sandwich or lavender cookies next time?", "author": "Maggie X."}

Being a hardcore ginger fanatic who will happily eat steamed rice with ginger-scallion sauce all day, everyday, I was sorely disappointed with the Gingersnaps. Although it had a nice crispy texture, the ginger \"spice\" was very overpowering and had a very sweet finish. I haven't had much luck with other items on the 7x7 List so it was that day I decided to end my pursuit with the 7x7 List. \n\nHowever, while visiting the Ferry Building one day, the whimsical rainbow of macarons sitting in the crystal-clear glass cookie jars caught my eye and were calling my name. These macarons totally redeemed Miette!\n\nThe macarons come in 7 flavors: Vanilla, Chocolate, Hazelnut, Pistachio, Strawberry, Rose-Geranium and Chocolate Lavender. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mUbk7FCM1R9gSko6EMdU2A?select=VdVsk_bydzv1XO916lyw8Q\n\nThese circular pieces of heaven have an almond glazed crust that gives it a nice, crispy contrast to the fluffy and moist, cake-like center. The combination of the two creates the perfect toothsome chewy texture. The cr\u00e8me filling is lusciously thick and melts in your mouth like a fine triple cream butter. Vanilla is my favorite as the fragrant simplicity complements the almond glaze flawlessly. My only gripe is they're just several bites large so you have to S-A-V-O-R them slowly, making sure each bite is as sweetly divine as the first. \n\nAt $1.75 a piece, these macarons are pricey but it's small price to pay for a little taste of heaven.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Just brown, cream and thats pretty much it. There were 5 different flavors the day I was in the Ferry Building: chocolate, vanilla, chocolate lavander, hazelnut and rose geranium. I ordered 2 of each. My favorite, of course, was the hazelnut. Any item with hazelnut is pretty much my kryptonite and this little macaron was by far the tastiest of this flavor rich bunch. Bought a stack of Miettte's graham crackers for some friends and they really liked them. As well as the macarons that we didnt finish on the spot. It was too good NOT to share.

The other locations have the quaint, boutique shop that I associate with the brand. This little stand seems too constrained and lackluster in its display of candies and treats compared to the other store locations. The macarons are delicious without a doubt, but flavors are natural and subtle, traditional and not too inventive. They are also not vibrantly colored like what other stores offer. I'm a fan of the old fashioned cupcake. The other cupcakes are good too. The frosting is buttery and not as stiff as it looks. It has a high ratio of frosting to cake. The panna cotta is ok.

I even took a bite out of each one of the 6 that I bought to try to find the rose one that I was so looking forward to, but all I could taste was the similar sugary, almondy sweetness. Is my palate just super underdeveloped, or were they having an off day? I also wanted to try the chocolate lavender but again, all I could taste was sugar and a hint of chocolate.\n\nThat's not to say they weren't delicious... they were. Miette's macarons have the perfect texture, that wonderful delicate crispness on the outside and the gooeyness on the inside as macarons should have. I think maybe I just had a tastebud killing lunch beforehand or something?\n\nEvery other item at that bakery that I've tried is stellar, from the brownies to the lemon tart to the merengues. Not to mention that they really have the whole cute, girly bakery decor down pat. Lots of places do that now (they know how to cater to their most voracious clientele), but I think Miette's one of the best at it. You can't help but get in a good mood when you look at their stuff! \n\nI haven't given up on their macarons yet!", "author": "Christina P."}

I have stopped by here last August, but wasn't really in a mood to get anything and was determined to get something this time.\n\nI love the entire concept of the store, being all cute and playful, at the same time, Miette means business when it comes to their baked goods.\n\nI took a leap of faith and went with two floral (rose and chocolate lavender) and a nutty flavor (hazelnut). Love the fact the display of macarons are in a glass jar, but noticed that they keep a huge stash in the fridge behind them.\n\nRose had a nice hint of rose, and hazelnut was pretty nutty. My only disappointment was the chocolate lavender, being all chocolate and no lavender what-so-ever.

The pistachio and chai flavors were definitely my two favorites.  Soft, fluffy with the right amount of shell crunch.. Miette Patisserie did an excellent job with making these huge macaroons.  Wasn't as big of a fan of the chocolate one (but I'm not really a chocolate gal so that's fair) and the vanilla was standard.. good but I'd opt for the first two..  \n\nDecent price for the size and quality.

It's a cute little shop next to blue bottle and humphrey's. \n\nThere wasn't a long line, thank god, so I got to order right away. I ended up getting the gingerbread and cream cheese frosting cupcake, two bite sized dolfin chocolates; one milk the other milk and caramel, a dark chocolate cover marshmallow with fleur de sel caramel and strawberry taffy. \n\nI'll start with favorite to least favorite \n\nThe marshmallow cover in chocolate with fleur de sel was ehhh. You literally will enjoy that piece of chocolate more at See's candy. \n\nThe bite size dolfin chocolates were alright. Nothing to rave about, again I've had better. \n\nThe strawberry taffy was pretty good, I'm use to taffy having a little tangy kick to it after, but this one was pretty smooth in taste. \n\nAnd lastly, there's the gingerbread cupcake with cream cheese frosting. Now, I absolutely love cream cheese frosting which is why I picked this cupcake. Of course I licked the frosting first before eating the cupcake whole and was a little disappointed that is was more on the cheesy side than sweet. Because I make it at home sometimes I load it with powder sugar. So once you take the cupcake wrapper off you can immediately tell how moist the cake is, which is great. Then I consume the frosting and the cake together and it was a perfect balance, it was no loner too cheesy because the gingerbread made up for the sweetness. \n\nAnd my final total was about $11\n\nWould I come back here again?

In typical San Francisco style, the founders like to use fresh local ingredients in their specials that change seasonally. No dyes are used, so their cookies have an earthy palette and flecks of freshly ground almonds. The texture and consistency of Miette's macaron's is perfect, I love how chewy and soft they are. But Miette's treats fall sadly short on the FLAVOR factor. All of their flavors are subtle and do not stand out.  I tried a box of all their macaroon staples and was unable to tell the difference between rose and pistachio. And while I love natural and organic ingredients for my goodies, the macaron is not the cookie to downgrade the fun. Their cookies lack color and the kind of flavor that macarons are famous for.\n\nMiette you're cute, but I'll be saving my macaroon money for Chantal Guillon and Patisserie Philippe!!!", "author": "Caroline J."}

Foodie treat perfection. I also love that these normally delicate treats have taken a step toward a hearty almond cookie rather than typically fragile-shelled variety. They are different in the best possible way. The flavor combinations ranged from classics like Pistachio or Hazelnut to lovely combinations like Chocolate Lavender or Rose Geranium. \n\nBeyond these tasty macaron bites, I very much enjoyed the Scharffen Berger mini chocolate cake. Rich fluffy cake topped with velvety thick frosting. Paired with cappuccino from Blue Bottle Coffee it was decadent dessert perfection.

I ordered one of all the flavors (not terribly difficult to do as they have just a half dozen or so) and they're undoubtedly different than classic French macarons in terms of the texture and density.  The shell is more substantial and \"cakey\" albeit exceptionally moist cake.  I personally appreciated the change of pace and found most of the fillings to be pleasantly delicate as opposed to more sharp and robust like some other bakeries.

But at $1.75 a pop for something the size of a contact lens here... when I can revel at Bouchon Bakery's delicacies that are bigger than the size of my palm for $3, I prefer to drive to Yountville, gas prices be damned.  \n\nAnd it's not just the size that matters, although it really does, *cough, cough* the spectrum of flavors is much more expansive and I just love watching the freshly-assembled beauties get restocked, right off the proofing trays.  \n\nThe $4 pot de creme is as dainty as it is dense, though the $1 refund for the container is keeping it real.  Real green, and that is, as Mother Martha would say, \"A good thing.\" \n\nI had to check out the organic Strauss Creamery Ice Cream Sammiches: I wanted Strawberry w/ chocolate cookie, but of course that was sold out.  Vanilla Cookie w/ creme fraiche was choice #2, and too subtle for my palate, though very true to taste.  The cookie component was delicate and didn't hold the crispness that I prefer and the holding temperature was a bit low.  I shall not tell a lie: I ate the whole thing, but think it would have been Happy Dance Worthy if there were some swirls of balsamic to complement the light creme fraiche.   Fleur de sel caramel would also have piqued my interest.  \n\nWater board me all you want, but the Scream Sorbet Sammiches (also $4) are much more dense, delicious and decadent.  Noah, I promise I wasn't cheating on you, I was just exploring my curiousity - it will never happen again.\n\nI picked up a few goodies, but the price point is a deterrent, even for an exquisitely described fruit-infused Italian sugar cube smaller than a matchbook for $1 each.  \n\nBasically, I'm awarding 3 stars, rounded up from 2.5 for the Bathing Suit Competition - the packaging and merchandising are lovely, but I want more than \"World Peace\" when it comes to my taste buds.", "author": "Kim D."}

It's light, fluffy, and perfectly moist. \n\nAnd the secret? One of their best items might just be their macarons. Unlike Paulette's (now renamed?) vibrant and distinct flavors, Miette goes for a soft and delicate flavor with the right amount of crispness and softness. However, it seems like the biggest problem we Americans have with consuming food (obesity aside) is that we don't know how to really enjoy it. The French have one-upped us on this one.\n\nSome of the reviews here say that they're bland and nothing special, but I believe that you just really need a clear palate and few expectations. Take a modest bite and let the sugar-coated macaron linger on your tongue before cramming the rest into your mouth. Perhaps sip a light tea, and let your taste buds speak for themselves.\n\nIt's a shame that they're $1.75 now, because I remember a time a year of two ago when I could get them during 'happy hour' at their Hayes location (pre-French pastry hype!) for $1!\n\nFavorites:\nThe old fashioned cupcake\nThe banana creme tartlette\nThe rose macarons\nGINGERSNAPS.

Then I remembered I wanted to check out the Ferry Building Farmers' Market. That's what I did and wandered into the marketplace after my venture... \n\nI passed by so many food stands, food stores, restaurants, and everything food-related and there I saw Miette and little did I know I bookmarked it so yes! I was in line waiting to try their macaroons and I was enticed by looking at the chocolate cake w/ butter cream and ganache.. I can finally unbookmark this to lower my bookmark counts. Lines were long but was executed rather quickly. \n\nI was finally up. I did not go overboard.. I saw various types of bagged cookies, cupcakes, tarts, cakes, macaroons, brownies.. I did not even get a chance to see what is on the left shelf! On impulse I got 2 macaroons for $1.75 each (yes, rather pricey in my opinion), I got 1 chocolate and 1 hazelnut one and I couldn't help it, I also grabbed a slice of that chocolate cake that I have been eying since I was in line.\n\nThe macaroons were placed in bags and a cute sticker sealed the bag nicely, the cake was wrapped tightly and nicely and into a box, also sealed w/ a sticker.. then stuffed neatly into a shopping bag.. I have to hand it to them that the cake was packed superbly! I walked around the city for a total of 5 hours and guess what- the bag was a little battered but the box, the cake... held its form, extremely moist, rich, sweet, and I did not feel guilty eating that entire slice for dinner. I think I licked the box.\n\nThe macaroons was another story.. I didn't wait to get home. I didn't wait to get out of there.. I opened the bag in excitement right after I paid for them and took a bite out of the chocolate 1 first and oh my- I stopped, screamed in total happiness, and plopped the entire thing in my mouth while onlookers laughed at me and some laughed w/ me afterwards.. I giggled and claimed that it tasted like heaven... it was so moist, sweet, and light in texture... my God I wish I bought 100 of those! I then plopped the entire hazelnut in my mouth but it didn't give me a taste orgasm like the chocolate one did.. still good but very light in hazelnut flavor. \n\nMy next trip here- I will get 100 chocolate macaroons and a million slices of that chocolate cake w/ butter cream and ganache.

I had the Pistachio Macaroons and the Banana Tart and they were both amazzzingggg!  The pistachio was not overpowering, with just the right amount of crunch and sweetness.  The tart was decadent, with a layer of cream, a layer a chocolate and a brittle-chewy crust that all went together so well.  My only complaint was that it could have had more banana flavoring.\n\nIf only I could eat more!  This was a great place for desserts and it completely hit the spot for me after my lunch at the Pier.  I must come back and try more of their delicious sweets!\n\nThanks, Miette.

I understand so much that I came to Miette to purchase a birthday cake for my co-worker first thing in the morning at their said opening time (9am). Frankly, I was in a hurry to get to work, and this was the only option I had at such short notice. To my surprise, upon arriving at Miette, the gates were still closed, the lights were still off, and the workers were still setting up for the day. Totally understandable, right? Well that would've been the case if the two gals behind the counter weren't so busy gossiping and gushing about their recent trip to Mexico, all whilst giving me dirty looks and whispering to each other about my early morning presence. \n\nI politely ask one of the girls \"excuse me, what time do you guys open?\" (mind you it was 9:05am and again, their opening time is 9). She snaps and says, \"we will be open in 5 minutes\". Fine. I can wait 5 minutes. So I wait, and I wait, and I wait. It is now 9:25 and the gates have finally opened and the girls set up the outside displays. I'm still standing there, waiting. After about 2 minutes of the girls standing and looking around, one finally looks at me and says \"you know we're open right?!\" \n\nOh. Hell. No. \n\nWhile I consider myself a professional, there was no way I was going to stand for that type of attitude. I politely walk up to her and ask \"do you guys always open 30 minutes late? That's pretty unprofessional\". She quickly replied with an excuse (instead of an apology), \"oh, our delivery came late\". Classy. \n\nLike I said before, they have great stuff to offer. I just don't appreciate the snarky attitudes and ridiculous sense of entitlement. Miette; hire better help, give them better training, do whatever it takes to make sure that your bakery isn't represented in a classless and unprofessional manner.

It really makes it stand out from other stores there.  They have cupcakes, cookies, macarons, candies, cake, and even ice-cream sandwiches.   Everything is just so cute there, especially all the cupcakes.  And this is why I ended up to buy a cupcake and a macaron.  \n\nCupcake was $3.25 each and I got the \"old fashioned\" cupcake.  \"Old Fashioned\" cupcake actually was the cupcake with the bright white meringue frosting & shiny red candy coated peanut.  It had the cute looking but it does not taste as good as it looks.  The cake itself was a little dry and the taste of the frosting was so-so.  The frosting was not go well with the cake and it melted too FAST!  By the time when I got back to the office, the frosting was melted already (only five minutes walk).  It was a mess..........Maybe the packaging was also a problem for this cupcake.  They put the cupcake into a Chinese food take-out box and that was too big for ONE cupcake.  It was totally fine for other types of frosting cupcake but not a good idea for this kind of frosting  \n\nFor macarons, it was just so-so too.  Not impressive at all.  It was too expensive for its size.  3 LITTLE bites for $1.75?!?!?!  I got the Hazelnut one and it did not taste any hazelnut at all....just way too SWEET!  Also I don't know how long they keep in a jar because mine was not that fresh............\n\nOverall, it seems like Miette Patisserie put a lot of effort into packaging and decorating, but I don't feel their products can compete with other bakeries in town.", "author": "Liza T."}

Are macaroons supposed to be chewy near the center but perfectly cakey on the outside?  Are they supposed to have fluffy, sweet-but-not-too-sweat whipped creamy filling?  Are they supposed to melt in your mouth while simultaneously giving your mouth an orgasm?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-21", "description": "PROS\n+ Convenient Ferry Building location\n+ Wide variety of cookies, cakes, and other confections to choose from\n\nCONS\n- Macarons are not uniform in size or shape - unprofessional-looking \n- Display method of macarons in glass jars = crushed shells\n- Buttercream-like filling oozes out of cookie sandwich\n- Limited flavor selection\n- Barely detectable flavor \n- Macaron consistency is way too cakey \n\nNote: This is a review for -only- Miette's macarons.\n\n\nCame here on a Saturday evening around closing time (~7pm) for a post Giants game snack. The end-of-the-day hour at which I came may have contributed to the shoddy state of the macarons by the time I got to them, but there are a number of things that are unacceptable for the premium price I am paying for a professionally made macaron. I will address each listed CON below: \n\n1. MACRONS ARE NOT UNIFORM IN SIZE OR SHAPE. \nThe two cookie halves are not symmetrical. Each half is bumpy and lumpy and the \"foot\" is uneven. It seems the almond flour is coarsely ground, making for the lumpiness and grittiness. Chantal Guillon makes theirs perfectly circular, and each macaron is uniform in appearance - this is what I would expect from macarons I buy in a store.\n\n2. DISPLAY METHOD IN GLASS JARS = CRUSHED SHELLS\nMacarons are displayed in large glass jars, with one jar of each flavor. While this may make for a pretty display, it does not bode well for the delicate macaron shells. The server behind the counter reaches into the jar with a gloved hand, and no matter how skinny the server's fingers are, he/she will have to dig around the surrounding macarons to get yours out. By the time the macarons were handed to me, part of the shells were crushed and bits of the foot were chipped off.\n\n3. FILLING HAS BUTTERCREAM-LIKE CONSISTENCY\nTo make matters worse, because the filling is more like buttercream than ganache, and the macarons are kept on the counter at room temperature, it is melty and runny, and when the server digs out your macaron from the jar, the cookie halves are partially separated and the filling oozes out. Terrible.\n\n4. LIMITED FLAVOR SELECTION &\n5. BARELY DETECTABLE FLAVOR\nThey only have 7 flavors. I guess for some, this creates more than enough choice, but seeing as I can barely detect the rose flavor in the rose geranium, nor the lavender flavor in the chocolate-lavender, NOR the pistachio, well, I guess it doesn't matter how many flavors they have. The dark chocolate flavor completely overshadowed the faintest hint of lavender. The chocolate flavor was quite good... but what happened to the lavender?\n\n6. MACARON SHELLS = TOO CAKEY \nMacarons are supposed to be delicate and airy. Miette's shells are way too chewy and cakey and taste like a full-on almond cookie. Not good. \n\nOVERALL:\nTo be fair, I haven't tried any of their other dessert offerings. But their macarons were a complete miss. For $1.75 a pop, I expect quality I can't achieve myself at home. Make your way out to Hayes Valley to Chantal Guillon instead. Theirs go for $1.70 only, and are much, much classier and just plain better.", "author": "Megan L."}

For example, see: http://www.naturesflavors.com). Anyway, to top off Miette's pathetic excuses for their lack of red velvet was the fact that nearly none of the other cupcakes on display had any other frosting other than buttercream. Meh! (there was the ginger cupcacke with creamcheese frosting but honestly, who wants ginger in a cupcake outside of Bangkok?) \n\nWe ended up ordering a chocolate cupcake with chocolate buttercream and although the cake part was ridiculously good (thanks to scharffenberger), the icing was disappointing. It was one of those \"butterface\" moments - the cupcake had everything going for it, moist and chocolaty goodness cake, nice presentation and when you make it up to the top, you realize the rest of it just isn't worth it. I don't know any other way to describe it other than perhaps recommending that they change their description of \"buttercream\" frosting to something more accurate, \"butterface\". Thankfully we had also ordered the mini scharffenberger which was a chocolate scharffenberger cake dome covered in two layers of scharffenberger ganache, mmm, sooo good. The best dessert I've had outside of Europe!\n\nBottom line, we'll definitely be returning for those mini scharffenberger bites of heaven but won't be frequenting Miette for our cupcake fix.", "author": "H T."}

I used to live in the city, but moved to the east bay awhile back. Since I've been living across the bridge, i haven't really walked around the Ferry Building during a weekend. Well we had brunch and enjoyed the nice Sunday weather and bought  different kinds fruits, etc. OK so if you are reading my review, you are probably thinking, \"How the heck does this relate to Miette??\"....\n\n     Well, the highlight of my Ferry Building experience was not exactly the Farmer's Market, but stepping inside the Miette Patisserie and tasting their scrumptious french macaroons! We walked throughout the Ferry Building and checked out several stores, but hands down, Miette is my favorite place within that vicinity. I tried the different flavored macaroons, but pistachio was the best. Then my friend reminded me that we went to Miette Patisserie in Hayes Valley several years ago. I recall that store was definitely an eye candy. Another review mentioned that the place looked like a \"Willy Wonka Candy Store meets Alice in Wonderland\" and i definitely agree with that yelp-er! However, when i went to the store in on Hayes Valley before, i didn't  try any of the macaroons. I was more fascinated with the colorful assortments of candy, cupcakes and cookies. \n\n     Nevertheless, the french macaroons are lovely with a sweetness that is very subtle so it keeps you wanting more. The only reason i gave Miette four stars is because they ran out of the pistachio flavor when i came back to the store a second time around that day i went to the Ferry Building, in hopes to take some home. But i guess it was such a popular flavor, so i should have just grabbed the opportunity and bought some the first time.", "author": "Karla M."}

The other flavors- vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut are good as well... but there's something quite \"essspeciale\" about the pistachio flavor.  I have intro'd a good amount of my friends to these tasty little morsels, and they too have enjoyed them.  Haha, someone referred to it as an \"orgasm in your mouth\". Not quite the choice of vocabulary I'd use, but I can easily see how it relates.

They definitely can't compare to the ones at the top Parisian vendors (Laduree and Pierre Herme) or Chantal Guillon in Hayes Valley.\n\nTheir cupcakes are also not rave-worthy. I was excited when they had cupcake versions of their famous old-fashioned cake with Italian meringue frosting (so I could finally cross that off the 7x7 list of 50 SF sweet treats), but it honestly wasn't that special. It's just whipped frosting instead of the usual super-sweet harder frosting. The cake part was not moist enough for me.\n\nThe Carrot Cake cupcake was decent but felt TOO light to me.

And don't get me wrong, it is definitely worth a try.  The shop is very cute and the macarons look really good.  However, if you are trying out Miette for the first time, I don't recommend buying $8 worth of macarons like I did.  I got one or two of almost every flavor (pistachio, strawberry, chocolate lavender, rose vanilla, etc.), and ended up taking a bite out of every flavor before discarding it.  They were just too sweet to finish.\n\nThe macarons are tiny and should not be too hard to finish, but some of the flavors I thought I'd really enjoy - like the chocolate lavender - were just way, way, way too chocolatey for my personal taste.  I think my favorite flavors were those of the vanilla variety, not the chocolate.\n\nHowever, I think some of the vanilla macarons have hazelnut in them, even if they do not specify a hazelnut flavor in the cream.  This is unfortunate, because I am allergic to hazelnut.  I suggest asking them beforehand about all the flavors if you have any sort of nut allergies.\n\nOverall, Miette is a cute pastry shop and I'm sure if you love sweets and macarons, you will love Miette.

Had I not have had (1) Bouchon bakery and (2) Fillmore bakeshop, I may not be so militant about macarons, but I have and I am. \n\nI was at the Ferry Bldg with some friends and got excited to see macarons at miette.  I don't go to the Ferry Bldg often, so having miette there was definitely new to me, though I think they were still in their initial months. \n\nI thought that the storefront presentation of the macarons was cute- macarons in apothecary jars. In retrospect though, I question the wisdom of storing them in this manner... touching each other and putting subtle pressure on the ones beneath. \n\nI got three macarons, two \"normal\" ones (chocolate? and possibly pistachio?) and one frou-frou one (the rose geranium).  The \"normal\" ones were unmemorable- neither succeeded in blowing my mind the way that Bouchon and Fillmore Bakeshop macarons do every time I bite into them. And there was just a hint of staleness. I hated the rose geranium. Just too weird for my tastes. I think I tend to be conservative when it comes to my macaron (and ice cream) flavors. But I suspect that people who tend to like things like lavender or verbena in their food might like the rose geranium.\n\nIt was really the service that sours me to this place. I don't think that people need to fawn over their customers, but I draw the line at overtly rude. The woman who helped me with my order flatly acted as if it were the biggest burden in the world to open the apothecary jars and pull out the macarons. She also openly looked aggravated that I dared to ask her a question about the rose geranium macarons. Maybe someone pissed in her cornflakes that morning, who knows? Nonetheless, the product (the macarons) is not good enough to justify snootiness on the part of the staff. In the future, I will be fulfilling my macaron cravings elsewhere.", "author": "Jia min C."}

He said it was pretty good, but I found it to be a disappointment. The texture was very chewy and more cake like than I am used to. I prefer them light and airy. The filling was also more liquidy/creamy than I am used to. Don't think I'll be back for the macarons, but the other goods in the display looked appetizing.", "author": "Katrina L."}

Of course, as I stumbled on Miette Patisserie, I couldn't pass up the chance to sample a few of the items the bakery had to offer.\n\nI purchased the Chocolate Parisian Macaroons, the Chocolate Orange Macaroons, a brownie, and a bag of the Chocolate Sables. \n\nThe marcaroons, although great and tasty, I could not distinguish between the two flavors I purchased. I expected that the Orange would have more presence in the macaroon then it ended up having. It was still good but I wish I could've tasted the orange flavor more. \n\nThe Chocolate Sables were good too. They definitely had their traditional sandy characteristic and were in fact, very chocolately. My husband has eaten half of the bag so he seems to really like it -- especially with this coffee. I'm not sure I would purchase these again though. I've had better. \n\nThe brownie was by far my favorite item purchased. I found that the texture of the brownie was PERFECTO! The outside was slightly chewy and the center was perfectly moist and tender. I wish I would've bought more of the brownies to snack on later. \n\nOverall, I thought the Miette was just ok.

It's a rare thing for me to go to a place like Miette to order treats, so I figured, why not?\n\nI liked the presentation of the overall store, and how they packed the cupcake and macarons, complete with a \"Miette\" sticker on top. I was amused that they boxed the singular cupcake in a take-out box (Chinese-style!).\n\nThe actual taste/value of the products: The cupcake part was moist, not the tastiest I've had, but I liked the frosting. It wasn't overly sweet/packed with HFCS, so that was a relief. The macarons were chewy, like nougat to me--I'd definitely go back to have a few more of these when my income allows me to do so.\n\nMy palate is mixed on what I think of Miette in the end: the prices I can do without, but like I've mentioned before, it's rare to find me at a place like Miette in the first place anyway. The taste and quality of the food was fine and justifiable in most senses. Service-wise: the worker was quick and amiable, but wasn't the utmost best in service.

Their store is quite appealing and cute like a candy shop; their cake displays are gorgeous, which lures me in every time.  But their prices give me a bit of sticker shock sometimes.\n\nI finally gave in and bought a $3.50 cupcake one day and wasn't extremely impressed.  First off, they don't have many flavor options for cupcakes so I just got a chocolate with white frosting which was just okay.   Their macarons look delish but after eating one, I kind of felt like I needed to go back to Paulette and scream for a better one.  But of course I'm just a huge fan of Paulette and french macarons made by french people.\n\nThe cookies seem decent and affordable and the little caramels are very enticing.

It was perfect.\n\nTheir rose geranium is definitely something unique to try. The floral smell is just right and not over powering. The buttercream in the middle was perfect and not too sweet. It complements the outer crust very well. \n\nAll the other flavors tasted very good too. I don't think I'll eat another macaron again unless it is from Miette's.

I usually buy a small box of them with my favorites being the pistachio, rose, and grapefruit. Each respective flavor compliments the macroon extremely well without any other overwhelming after taste. Just the perfect accent. I seriously get angry when someone tries to eat one of my macaroons. So please, STAY AWAY. \n\nBesides the macaroons, Miette offers up other delicious and equally beautiful pastries. There are seasonal tarts like blueberry in the summer or banana cream in the fall with a flaky and buttery crust. The cream is always delicate yet rich. The Scharffen Berger chocolate cake is amazing with a nice warm tea or cold milk. Scharffen Berger chocolate has a lot of distinctive flavors to it and you can taste it in cake form as well. The chocolate is also not overwhelming where you can't taste the cake which is what happens to a lot of chocolate cakes. I also love their coconut cake which is very creamy with several layers of frosting and cake. I can just imagine how much work goes into it. There are also mini scones, eclairs, cupcakes, pot de cremes, the list goes on. \n\nEverything is always fresh and made with organic and local ingredients.

Against my better judgement, I went ahead with the vanilla as well. \n\nTo be fair, I ate them the next day, so they may have lost some of their freshness. Both macarons looked similar in color, so I was hoping to distinguish them with a bite; unfortunately they both tasted the same to me (and I really like pistachio flavored things!) So if you are more into subtle flavoring, then these two flavors are for you. I on the other hand am a fan of bolder and richer flavors. \n\nAs for the texture, it was very good. The cookies had a great crispy outer shell and chewy inner; the cream that sandwiched the two cookies together was nice and smooth.\n\nAt $1.75 a piece they're on the higher side, but I guess if I'm willing to pay $4 for a cupcake it doesn't seem so bad.", "author": "Leslie T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-06-12", "description": "When I was small (and Christmas Trees were tall), I read a story about a crow that had migrated from its native land and had found a new home in a lush green, gorgeous valley. It made friends and tried to adapt to the new surroundings. But, every so often, pondering over the vagaries of life, it would let out a sigh and say \"Aah, incomparable soothing shade and restful comfort.\" \n\nWhen its new friends asked what that was all about, it would mournfully talk about the beauty and grandeur of its homeland. After a while the crow started feeling really miserable and homesick, and no matter how much its friends tried to cheer it up and want it to enjoy its new home, it would still only sigh \"Aah, incomparable soothing shade and restful comfort\". Their curiosity piqued, the other crows decided that they must indeed travel with the crow and see the wondrous land that made their friend homesick. \n\nSo, one fine day they told the crow that they wanted to accompany it and see the beauty of its native land. The crow all excited flaps its wings and takes off and the others follow. After days of flying, finally the crow exclaims that home is nearby and picks up speed.\n\nThe other crows lag behind, but can hear its voice. After a few hours they hear it cawing excitedly, but can hardly see anything ahead of them. True, there's a clearing, but there is only barren land, and a solitary tree. \n\nCurious, they fly onward and finally catch sight of their friend. Sitting content and relaxed under the single remaining branch of the solitary tree, chattering: \"Aah, incomparable soothing shade and restful comfort\". \n\nSo, what does this story have to do with Miette? Well, everything... I've had to listen no end to all the visiting and transplant friends from SF rave no end about its food and how NYC simply can't compare. While I usually agree with some of the food comments, I am not sure that the baked goodies and desserts in SF are all they are hyped out to be. As a dessert person, I listen with skepticism to excited chatter about how Magnolia is over-rated (true), how Sugar Sweet Sunshine is only hype (bah), how Payard can't compare to Miette (blasphemy) ... so on and so forth...chatter, chatter, chatter....\n\nTired of all this, even though my recent stay in SF was brief, I made it a point to sneak out in the evening and make my way to the Ferry Building to sample the \"divine goodness\" of Miette. Obviously, I only had high expectations. After extensive sampling, I thought the Pot De Creme was the highlight of my trip, followed by the macarons (of which I particularly liked Pistachio). The macarons had the perfect exterior (crisp and chewy) and a good bite through to the filling. To its credit, the crust didn't fall apart upon touch, but it wasn't the melt in the mouth goodness that is Payard. Nor is the macaron filling as generous as what one sees in the magic from La Maison Du Chocolat.\n\nBeing a huge fan of Pierre Herme who created Korova, I wasn't blown away by the chocolate sable cookie here. Nor, actually by any of the other cookies, particularly Peanut Butter (not after you've had Nutter Butter at Bouchon). But, the biggest disappointment were cakes (Tomboy and Scharffen Berger) and the cupcakes. While pretty to look at, the cake was consistently dry in all the versions I tried (vanilla, chocolate, or yellow). Even the flourish from strawberry butter cream could not save the cupcake. I found the popular marshmallow cream frosting quite meh...too sweet. \n\nI do look forward to trying out Crixa and Tartine on my next trip. But, sorry SF wallahs - for the moment it appears that when the gods of dessert were doling out their blessings, SF got shortchanged.

Miette managed to make theirs moist, chewy, and crispy all at once as opposed to a simply crispy meringue. It's hard to describe the texture, and the only thing I can say is to try it yourself to understand.\n\nOf their flavors, I tried the grapefruit, hazelnut, pistachio, and rose geranium. Hazelnut and pistachio were good but they weren't standout. Grapefruit, their seasonal flavor at the time I went, was surprisingly sweet and slightly tart without any of the bitterness of eating an actual grapefruit. The home run came with the rose geranium. It had the perfect amount of rose flavor to it to adorn your taste buds. \n\nAt $1.75/macaron, it is on the higher priced side, but I found it worth it. They also have other desserts and pastries, also on the higher end of the price spectrum. One of these days, I'd like to try their Scharffen Berger cake, but at $35 for a 6-inch cake, I can wait.\n\nThe only downside is that the macarons in their jars aren't all the same size. When you order them, cross your fingers and hope they grab the big ones to get your moneys worth.\n\nI'll easily come back for their macarons if I'm ever in the area again.", "author": "Kevin P."}

Having read a few reviews, including a report that their gingerbread cupcake had been named Best Beer-spiked Cupcake by none other than Alton Brown, I figured we'd best make a stop. We ordered the cupcake and a grapefruit macaron.\n\nThe cupcake we received was dense but surprisingly dry. Although it contains all of the usual gingerbread spices, the overwhelming flavor for me is that of savory bread, which I'm sure is a result of the beer, and of molasses. The cream cheese frosting is fine, but nothing special. All in all, it's a fine cupcake but I'm not entirely sure what the fuss is about.\n\nThe macaron has a touch of grapefruit flavor. Honestly, it could have used much more. There is also a very grainy texture to the meringue portion of the macaron that is not pleasing. Since their own menu describes them as containing coarsely ground almonds, it seems reasonable to think the texture is intended, but it comes off feeling somewhat unfinished or poorly mixed.\n\nWhat Miette lacked in the goods, it certainly makes up for in style.

Then as I came back to reality, we ran back and waited in line to get MORE to share with the fambam later that evening (which was btw, a FAIL.

Yummmmy!\n\nAmong all, the rose was definitely my favorite, hands down. For a little cookie, it held a great amount of flavor, and aroma that just sends your eyeballs rolling to the back of your head as you put a smile on.

Also, they don't advertise their ice cream sandwiches much and I can't understand why not as they are damn good.

Ever since I tried the macarons at Laduree in Paris, I've been on a hunt to find comparable ones in SF.  I've devoted serious time into deciding which macarons are better: Miette v. Chantal Guillon (formerly Paulette), and I've decided that Chantal Guillon takes the cake. \n\nDon't get me wrong. Miette's macarons are really good. They have the perfect macaron texture: delicate, crisp shell on the outside + gooey, almond sweetness on the inside.  Compared to the texture of Chantal Guillon macarons, the texture is a bit more rustic and slightly denser. However, I cannot tell the difference between the flavors.  I've tried all of Miette's flavors and they taste too similar to each other.\n\nThe store itself at the Ferry Building is really cute and saccharine sweet. The workers behind the counter look like they stepped out of a Martha's Stewart Living magazine.  Unfortunately, I feel like Miette is one of those places where you pay for the name and ambiance, but not for the items they make.

Of course I'm there!\n\nLong story long: \n\nAs most of you know, I'm a pastry chef.  One of the reasons being that I have a HUGE sweet tooth.  If it didn't contribute to weight gain, diabetes, and countless oral cavities, I would probably eat stuff like cookies and chocolate everyday.  And creme brulee.  And brownies.  Hell, lots of sweets.  I mean, how can you NOT love something that's edible and sweet?  And I'm not talking about little Bo sheep, which I had last night and was DELICIOUS.  But I digress.\n\nWith the Ferry Building being home to about 8 or 9 places on my food crawl list to potentially hit up, I jumped at the chance to add a couple of bakeries and patisseries to the list.  The store front itself is a little smaller than some of the other stores, of course when all you're selling is essentially a handful of different items, you don't need much space.  The display tables outside had an assortment of shortbread cookies of various flavors.  I picked up a bag of vanilla shortbread cookies and chocolate chip shortbread cookies, deciding to bring them to CAV later that evening.  I also picked up a vanilla and a chocolate macaron for myself.  I think the bags of cookies were $4-5 and the macarons were... $.75 each?  Basically, its not dirt cheap but isn't highway robbery either.  I would say the cuteness/price ratio is rather low.  Or high?  I think you know what I mean.\n\nThe woman behind the counter was really nice and super helpful.  I made my purchase and was on my way.\n\nWhen I eventually left the Ferry Building, I finally dove into the macarons.  Oh man, they were so good.  I kind of wish I had gotten more, but I figure, this is just reason to go back next time I'm in SF.  And later that evening when we broke into the shortbread cookies at CAV, those were good too.

Miette owner Meg Ray really has a talent for turning desserts you think you know into something new with elegant, understated flavors. \n\nThe macarons (don't dare call them macaroons!) have been mentioned by others and they really hit the spot. It's not easy to make good macarons; in fact, it may be the toughest dessert/bakery item in the French repertoire. Miette nails them with tasty cream and crisp, airy cookies. \n\nAnother bonus is that Miette is able to ship normal cookies and macarons to your door! Fantastic service. Now you need not tramp up to SF to get your baked goods fix. Their cookies, especially the chocolate sable, is brilliant. The cookie is clearly high quality, made of really good subtle-tasting dark chocolate. Not too sweet, which is the problem with many chocolate cookies. The chocolate chip cookie, again a classic, gets reinvented with flavorful chocolate chips and soft, crumbly cookie around it.

The texture, the taste, everything was just perfect!  And this was when the macarons were not at optimal temperature settings! \n\nNow I go back whenever i can(that's saying a lot considering I'm not the biggest fan of sweets)...whether to this location or the one in the hayes valley--I even go WAY out of my way to get here, and treat myself to my favorite treat in the States.

A few weeks ago a visit to Sprinkles was less than satisfactory and it got me wondering if I was really just being sucked into all the hype.\n\nAnd now, macaroons are the new cupcakes.  At least in my books. \n\nIt all started with a short coverage in the Travel Channel featuring small UFO-shaped sweets in various colors - the soundtrack was what got me watching (it was the catchy tune of Bach's Invention No. 8), but after the five-minute schpiel, I couldn't help googling macaroons and finding out that Miette quite possibly sells the most famous macaroons in SF.\n\nSo off I went to their cute shop in the gourmet food mecca that is Ferry Building and picked one from each of the macaroon jars.  I'm a simple girl so my top three might well be the most boring flavors available but who cares - they are hazelnut, chocolate and vanilla.  Unlike cupcakes, macaroons take only two bites to consume and don't leave you feeling like you just downed a loaf of bread or a pint or Guinness.  Another advantage of its petite size is that it allows people with 'eyes-bigger-than-stomach' syndrome like me to hedge my bet with a number of different flavors instead of having to go all in with just one.   \n\nSo I'm a fan.  This might be one of the many posts about macaroons.", "author": "Ange L."}

During our trip to San Francisco we decided to try a few cupcakes from this little bakery shop at the Ferry Market. They looked very pretty and the packaging was cute and at the very least we could say we tried something new. Words cannot express the explosion of deliciousness that took place in my mouth! The cake itself was moist but firm. It didn't crumble and fall apart when I took a bite. The buttercream frosting was sweet but not too much so. It didn't leave that weird fatty film on the roof of your mouth that cheap buttercream knock-off frostings do. \n\nWe found ourselves craving more as soon as we finished the first half-dozen we bought. We stopped by the shop on our way to the airport to satiate our cravings with some more delicious goodies. The carrot cake cupcake is the best I've ever tasted! Packed with yummy bits of carrot and currants and little coconut flakes all topped off with the best cream cheese buttercream frosting I've ever had the pleasure of tasting in my entire life! It may seem hard to beat that, but my personal favorite was the Old-Fashioned with Italian Meringue frosting. It was a moist chocolate cupcake that had just the right amount of richness. Topped with a fluffy cap of creamy meringue that reminded me of the ooey-gooey yumminess of a perfectly roasted marshmallow. Taking a bite of the sweet creation left little tufts of meringue on my lips and nose! So delicious!\n\nIf you have the opportunity to try any of the magical sweet delights from Miette, do so!

Out of all the stores in the Ferry Building Miette was one of the few that caught my eye; it's really cute and their desserts looked yummy. I was however not that impressed upon trying out a couple of their desserts.\n\nRose Geranium Macaron: I asked one of the girls working there which two of the four macarons (vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate and Rose Geranium) were the best. She suggested the Rose Geranium and hazelnut. I've never tried desserts infused with floral flavors so I tried the Rose Geranium macaron. Immediately after the first bite, I already didn't like it. I didn't like the rose geranium filling flavor but the texture and taste of the macaron itself was good. It wasn't too sweet and the macaron just crumbles in your mouth.\n\nHazelnut Macaron: This was much better than the Rose Geranium. The hazelnut filling wasn't too sweet. It was actually more on the bitter side. However, I wouldn't get this macaron again.\n\nCarrot Cupcake: I didn't like it but it's probably because it wasn't sweet enough for me. I tend to like carrot cupcakes/cakes that are on the sweeter side. I thought that even carrot cupcakes/cakes you get from grocery stores like Safeway taste better. I thought that the cupcake itself was not moist/soft enough.\n\nChocolate Cupcake with Strawberry Buttercream: I didn't like this either. The chocolate cupcake itself was again on the more bitter side. Like the other cupcake I tried, it wasn't moist enough for me. I think their cupcakes are just like that? The strawberry buttercream on top didn't have a strong enough strawberry flavor either. I didn't like the consistency of the buttercream either--I felt like it just stayed in my throat for a long time cause of the rich buttery consistency.\n\nI split everything I got with a friend. He said the cupcakes were pretty good and that he really liked the Rose Geranium macaron. Maybe it's just me. But I've been to a lot of cupcake places and Miette cupcakes just don't compare to the cupcakes I've had previously. It's a really cute place though.\n\nOh, I also thought the cupcakes were a bit overpriced. $3.25 or $3.75 for a cupcake. I can't remember.\n\nAlso, the girl working there recommends the Lavender Shortbread ($5 for a bag) and the Walnut Shortbread.

I begged my roommate for one and of course he saide yes. That was when it was LOVE at first bite and site! The carrot cake was moist and the cream cheese frosting was heavenly sweet.\n\nI love Miette's so much that I decided to try their online ordering system to order a carrot cake. The carrot cake was $26 and was rather small, but totally worth it! I ordered the cake Thursday night and wanted to make sure I could pick it up on Saturday morning. The shop is rather busy, so you have to leave a voicemail. One of the workers returned my call and assured me that my cake would be ready for pick up first thing in the morning. The staff was super friendly and asked me if I wanted them to add sugar flowers for decoration.

They also don't last - mine went stale a mere 3-4 hours after I initially bought them, despite keeping them in the box. None of the flavors particularly stood out to me. I wasn't a huge fan of the orange chocolate, and I thought the rose geranium was interesting. The rest of the flavors kind of blended together with each other in one, forgettable blur. They're also pricey for what you get, at almost $2 per (small) bite of macaron.

I go to great lengths for the best ones. After a year of voracious marcaron consumption including, but not limited to Bouchon, Payard, Chantal Guillon (formerly Paulette), and Maison Laduree (yes, the MOTHER of all French Macarons, I know, still missing Pierre Herme though), I am surprised but certain that Miette's are the best (when they manage to get it right, I can't say they win in the consistency department, but when they get it right, they REALLY get it right). If you want pretty pastel colors, rainbows and ponies, these are not it, they don't use food coloring. They just simply taste great - crisp, moist and chewy, subtle and not too sweet. The variety is usually small, 4-5 at any one time - I've had choco, choco/orange, coffee, hazelnut, rose, raspberry, choco lavender, and pistachio, and they all rock, but I have dreams about floating on a pillow of their Vanilla, it's pretty damn perfect. \n\nTheir ginger snaps are one of the 7x7 things to eat before you die - I'm not a ginger snap person, but it's probably the best one I've had, and they are HUGE. The cupcakes are respectable also - light, smooth frosting and generally moist (but not always, so maybe stick with the macarons). Plus they sell a variety of tasty foreign chocolate and candy bars that you can't get in most U.S. stores.\n\nAnd don't even get me started about the store front. If you think the Ferry building has eye candy, the Hayes Valley store is like Willy Wonka meets Alice in Wonderland frolicking with the Easter Bunny.

Jelly as a filling.  Please, please, spare me the trouble of biting into a raspberry macaron and getting a mouthful of jelly.  \n3.  Air pockets in the cookie.

I was never fond of gingersnaps until I tried some out of hunger on Thanksgiving.  It was some sort of generic gingersnap cookies but delicious nevertheless, so I thought maybe it's time to give Miette's gingersnaps a try.  \n\n$7 for a cute little box of maybe twenty.  Any more expensive I might call it quit and go home and bake some cheap chocolate chip cookies myself, but $7 is acceptable, especially for Ferry Building price where across the aisle you can buy a tomato for $7.  \n\nAnyway, it's worth the price.  Sugary, buttery, and spicy!  I don't know if it's something I NEED to eat before I die, but it's certainly good enough that I will buy again. \n\nNow I just need to start trying their other cute adorable pastries.", "author": "Candice B."}

That's a lot coming from a woman who doesn't believe something can be too sweet or too chocolate-y. \n\nThis place isn't horrible but the combination of high cost and underwhelming desserts makes it unappealing to even the most strong-willed dessert fiends. I started off my last course of lunch with a vanilla macaron from Miette. The filling tastes just like unsalted butter. There was no vanilla taste to be found. Now I enjoy butter but not by its lonesome in dessert. I *gasped* tossed it out after two bites (I had a second bite just to make sure I didn't like it). That's $0.75 that I threw out (the entire thing was $1.50, which already is quite high for something the size of a blown up quarter). \n\nI then started in on the chocolate/PB cupcake ($3.50) and, again, met with disappointment. It wasn't bad like the macaron but it wasn't memorable. I've had similar from Safeway for much less money. On a separate occasion, I had the chocolate tart ($5). That was perhaps the best dessert I've had from this place, but the bar is quite low. I liked the crust of the tart but found the chocolate in the tart to be just too much. There was no other texture or flavor in addition to the chocolate. In essence, it was boring. \n\nI won't boycott Miette but I certainly won't make a special trip here (and brave the Ferry Building parking and crowd) just for this place. Oh and I should mention that on one of my visits, the employee had an attitude and was not helpful. I asked her what was her favorite that was chocolate and she basically listed everything that had chocolate in a blase tone. I needed help narrowing down the options, not being read the options.", "author": "Gwen L."}

The desserts here are fantastic. You get your choice of pastries, cakes, miniature to full-sized tarts, cupcakes, macaroons, and even homemade candies here. And no, they are not cheap at all. However, these are some of the best desserts I have ever put in my mouth.\n\nTheir cases are lined with some of the most spectacular cakes, tarts, and desserts you have ever seen. By no means are they like what you would get from Charm City Cakes or anything, but the fact that they look homemade is what amazes me. They look so homey and they made me believe that the people who made these put a lot of love into making them look so brilliant.\n\nThe little buttermilk panna cottas were...well, little. I do have to say that they were delicious. The panna cotta itself was creamy. That's all you tasted. Wonderfully fresh cream and a little bit of vanilla. There was a slight tangy tone because of the buttermilk, but I liked it a lot. The fresh strawberries on top added some sweetness and it went PERFECTLY with the silky panna cotta. P.S. If you return the glass jar it came in, you get $1 back.\n\nI got two vanilla cupcakes - one with a strawberry frosting and the other with a regular vanilla frosting with sprinkles. I didn't have one myself, but my cousin did tell me that they were so light. I hate it when cupcakes are heavy. They're supposed to be airy and should not take any effort to devour. \n\nThe strawberry cr\u00e8me cake was our favorite. The cream in the cake was sweet but not sugary sweet. It was light and had the perfect amount of strawberry in it. The cake itself was light as air as well. The banana cr\u00e8me tart was good also. Plenty of whipped cream and a nice banana custard. The lemon tart (my choice) was so yummy. It makes your mouth pucker the way it's supposed to. The tart shell, which seemed to be made of some sort of wafer was very good. Overall...refreshing. That's what I liked about it. It was refreshing.\n\nIn all, I spent about $30 for just the items you have read about in this post - each dessert was about $3. I know it's not cheap and you probably think they are ripping you off, but considering how good the desserts tasted and how they use quality ingredients, it's all worth it. The employees of the store are very nice and pack everything with so much care - from lining the take-home boxes in pink tissue paper to using color coding stickers to indicate which of the items needed refrigeration. This place is so cute, and I will not hesitate to come back and have another buttermilk panna cotta.", "author": "Joanne B."}

Chances are, a taste of just one of Miette's desserts is going to get you hooked. \n\nI've never really been a fan of macaroons, but the macaroons at this place must have crack in them or something. The vanilla, chocolate orange, and hazelnut macaroons are incredible--crispy and crunchy on the outside, flavorful and spongy on the inside. But it's the grapefruit macaroon that is to-die-for: fluffy, light, and with the perfect tangy hint of grapefruit flavor. \n\nOther winning selections include the chocolate short bread cookies, the gingerbread cupcake and the strawberry chocolate cupcake. The cupcakes are especially moist and decadent. My sister got the apricot butter cream cupcake and loved it so much that she wouldn't even share with the rest of our family. Yes, apparently it was really THAT good.\n\nMy only real complaint is with the price. I feel like everything here is $1 more expensive than it should be, especially considering the wide variety of (less expensive) dessert shops in SF that rival Miette in terms of quality and selection. I also had a bite of a not-so-great banana cream tart that was the only real disappointment of all the desserts I've tried there.\n\nAs for the ambience, Miette is modest in size, yet full of charm.

I had never even heard of Miette before a recent visit to SF when I ventured inside the Ferry Building for the first time. There is something here for every taste and budget. You don't need to buy an entire cake or settle for just cupcakes. There is so much more going on in this little store! Although, they do have damn good cake! ;)\n\nNone of the famous cupcakes looked nor sounded especially exciting according to their descriptions but we did end up being baited by the gravitational pull of their scrumptious mini-ganache cakes. They are like mini individualized chocolate bombes generously robed in perfectly smooth chocolate ganache and adorned with a single pink baby sugar flower with tiny hexagonal design detailing on the yellow stigma. HOW CAN YOU JUST WALK AWAY FROM SOMETHING LIKE THAT? It would be like walking away from a destitute infant kitten peeled from its mother's teat and placed in the euthanasia unit of your local animal shelter. But without the added inconvenience of feeding, tending, and taking it in for shots each year.\n\nWe also nabbed a few extra goodies for the rode before leaving SF to get a good sampling of this place, which included a couple of chocolate-mandarin macarons (not to be confused w/ the coconut \"macaroon\") and two madeleines - one regular, one chocolate. I hate to say the madeleines were a bit disappointing, especially the chocolate one, which fell short of any remotely intense chocolate flavor and had an odd spiciness to it. Definitely don't expect it to taste anything like brownies, or even chocolate cake for that matter. The original madeleline, however, was much better than its chocolate counterpart. \n\nSeriously guys, the star of this baked goods show is the macaron! I expected my first macaron to taste like something akin to light puffed rice cookies with faint chocolate orange flavor but I had to try and see what all the fuss was about. Imagine my delight when I bit into what tasted like the fudgiest brownie of my life filled with thick chocolate orange fudge!!! They tasted nothing like they looked and instead were surprisingly extraordinary...\"orgasmic\" comes to mind! ;) But really, smuttiness aside, I have never tried anything like these.

My father has mastered the art of replicating the Pot De Cr\u00e8me, and frankly I have yet to taste anyone's that can rival his.  \n\nThis year for his birthday I contemplated baking him a cake, but given his abilities in this arena I knew my performance would be equal to a cake purchased at Safeway, and I like my dad so he deserves better than that.   As I flagrantly strolled through the Ferry Building I happened upon and adorable Patisserie with pink decor and big glass jars filled with homemade taffy.  Immediately I was pulled to the glass counter filled with Pot de Cr\u00e8me.  I bought all of them, in addition to some Truffle Tarts and a small Scharffen Berger Cake. When I phoned my mother to tell her about my purchases, she dashed my happy mood.\n\n\"But Rosie!  You know they won't be as good as his.  He isn't going to like them.  You bought how many?\"\n\nSheepishly I brought out my tray Pot de Cr\u00e8mes, Truffle Tarts and the small  Scharffen Berger Cake from Miette. I held my breath as he took a bite...as I watched the smile spread across his face I let out a sigh of relief .  He ate every single Pot de Cr\u00e8me, sharing only spoonfuls with my mother.  At the end of the evening there was not a crumb left on our dessert tray.  \n\n\"Where is this Miette?\"  He asked as we ushered them out the door.  I guess my mom was wrong.", "author": "Rosie C."}

That first bite, when your teeth hits the filling, it's soft and tangy, but as you bite down, the tart is perfectly baked with a crunch to it. The best lemon tarts will enable you to not only finish an entire one on your own, but crave a second one without suffering from any sort of sweetness overload. The filling is a work of art, to perfect the balance of sweet and tangy is something that causes many lemon tarts to meet their downfall. The crust, cannot, at any point be neglected, it has to be a perfect blend to make the perfect flaky but crunchy crust. \n\nMiette's lemon tart was definitely impressive, meeting my harsh critique and leaving me very satisfied. However, their peanut butter cookies were weak, hence the 4 star.", "author": "Cindy C."}

Organic fruits are fresher and sweeter and you can taste the difference. But, I can't say that desserts made with organic products necessarily taste better. I can't tell the difference and altho' Miette uses organic ingredients, the choc cupcake with vanilla butter cream for $3 didn't taste any better than most places. The cupcake was tasty and moist but I'm not a fan of butter cream even if theirs tasted OK. It was a tiny cupcake offering 3-4 bites max or 1 bite for a large mouth bass. \n\nEven tastier was the chocolate eclair with a creamy custard filling. The chocolate Madeline (75 cents) was dry and didn't have much of a chocolatey flavor.  They have tarts and cakes which were about $24 -$30 for a 6 in cake (it looks smaller than that).  8 in cakes/tarts are special order and run $35-$50.  They have choc cakes, vanilla cake w/lemon buttercream, Princess cake, bittersweet cake/marshmellow topping, gingerbread cake, NY style cheesecake, Scharffen Berger cake (all chocolate), yellow cake/choc frosting, 4 layered choc cake, lemon tart, lime tart, banana cream tart.\nNot sure I'd try their goods again, but maybe a macaroon in the future.

The cake is SUPER rich which I usually don't like, but the cake was so well complemented by the light buttercream that it made for an amazing combo. I hate stiff hard frosting that makes me feel like I'm eating lard. The frosting at miette is really amazing...it's so fluffy and airy that it fools you into thinking \"Oh this can't be that fattening...it's just air!\" (The cake is a different story.) I recently came back and got a vanilla cupcake with strawberry buttercream. It was also really good, although chocolate is better. In fact, I think that the chocolate with strawberry frosting is my favorite cupcake in the world. Sprinkles red velvet is a close second, but with that I have to wipe half the frosting off before even taking the first bite.

(Magnolia Bakery in NYC is the most famous and notorious offender.)\n\nI approached the Miette display case, hoping not get duped yet again. Cupcakes offerings were basic (vanilla, chocolate or yellow cake) with different frosting flavors. I got a yellow cake with chocolate butter cream and Sooj got a chocolate cake with strawberry butter cream.\n\nYellow cake was a bit dry, but still tasted good, and the chocolate butter cream was incredible. It was almost as good as the mocha butter cream frosting Goldilocks uses on their mocha chiffon cakes. Sooj's chocolate cupcake was moist and chocolatey, and the strawberry butter cream frosting was really good. \n\nI also picked up a chocolate tart for my wife because she would have killed me if I didn't bring anything home for her. It was amazing. Rich, thick dark chocolate in a light, flaky shell was a nice contrast in textures and was absolutely delicious.\n\nSo good going, Miette. You gave me a little hope that the cupcake craze isn't a complete farce, and your other offerings also look great. Next time, I'm going to try some of the macarons.", "author": "Arnold G."}

I got 4 bars at $6 each.  I do not think they are worth $6. \n\nI will rank my 4 bars by my liking:\n\n1) Lavender with sea salt with milk chocolate.  strong lavender flavor and the sea salt was a plus.\n\n2) Fleur de Sel, which is just sea salt.  Nothing special, just the salt enhanced the chocolate flavor.\n\n3) Jasmin, which is just flavored with jasmine flavor.  Not enough jasmine flavor at all.  Have to really play around in on the tongue to taste it.  Otherwise you are just tasting the chocolate.\n\n4) red peppercorn with dark chocolate.  Cannot taste the red peppercorn at all.  the dark chocolate basically masked all the taste.

This place is fine and the Scharffenburger Chocolate domes are ever so pretty to look at, but they aren't nearly as tasty as they look.

We  originally wanted a gelato, but since we saw this place first, decided to give it a try.\n\nWe fell in line and when it was our turn, the woman on the straight, long-ish dark haired snotty woman at the counter decided to make believe that she's blind and somehow didn't see us and decided to ask the gentleman who literally just walked up the counter if he needed any help.  Thankfully, he said we were there first, so she had no choice but to ask us what we wanted.  \n\nI ordered 2 each of the macarons.  There were maybe 6-7 varieties, strangely enough, all were either a sickly, speckled beige color, and 2 in chocolate.  They were completely different flavors, but I guess they had no strength to put food coloring on any of those bad boys so if you ordered a bunch like we did, you'd pretty much have to play Russian Roulette and gain a bunch of unwanted pounds eating each one until you hit upon the flavor you wanted in the first place.  Brilliant!\n\nNext, my sister wanted a pot de creme.  The same woman decided to correct her in the proper way of saying it.  Well, my sister happened to have spent several summers throughout France, painting, and she certainly knows how it's proper pronunciation, but just didn't want to be pretentious and rub it in.  I guess since this woman's big pursuit in life is to wait a counter at the Ferry Building, she feels its her very own crusade to teach the populace in general proper pronunciation.\n\nShe did a bunch more things that are just too annoying to describe.  My point is, if you decide to buy anything from this place, pray you don't get her to serve you.\n\nWould you believe she still f-ed up and gave my sister the wrong dessert after all that crap she gave us?  We discovered this in the car, far away from the building already. but since the garbage she was trying to pawn off on us was too sickly looking, I told my sister to go back and get what she ordered in the first place, in stead of what was given, about 1/4 the price of what we paid.  Convenient mistake, huh?\n\nThe macarons tasted absolutely disgusting, stale and much too \"processed\".  All this, close to $30 + a whole bunch of unnecessary stresss = priceless.\n\nI'LL NEVER GO BACK.

I first made my rounds by checking out each store to see what they had to offer. Miette stuck out to me not only for their pink sign but the goodies behind the glass case. On my way back around, I noticed the macaroons and cupcakes. Considering I've never had a macaroon before I decided to make my one purchase at the Ferry Building a selection of their macaroons. These tiny cookies were better than I imagined. These delicate things were not only light and airy but full of flavor. Out of their selection I think my favorite is the vanilla. I'd definitely be back for more macaroons and possibly a cake purchase. One negative I didn't expect was the price, $1.75 for one little cookie but I guess the flavor makes up for the cost.", "author": "Angela S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-26", "description": "Background: The Principal Investigator's current body of work has found that cupcakes, while perceived by many to be overrated (salty b & Arnold G, 2007), can in fact induce positive affective states in consumers. The affective states most commonly associated with cupcake consumption is euphoria, with anecdotal evidence suggesting what some describe as \"warm and fuzzies\" (Steph P., 2007). Most recently, the PI launched a multi-site, ongoing research project  in San Francisco http://www.yelp.com/biz/oHuPyoGY7nhCQeprHCv21g?hrid=z3tvKVFONgQSedr7hkj57A to test levels of euphoria induced and gather evidence for the question of \"Who has the best cupcakes in the Bay Area?\".  The current review presents another study in this research project.\n\nMethod:\n\nThe site for Study #2: Miette Patisserie in the Ferry Building Marketplace. Samples included:\n\n1) Chocolate cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting\n2) Gingerbread cupcake with cream cheese frosting\n3) Chocolate cupcake with rapsberry buttercream frosting\n4) Assortment of macarons: hazelnut, pistachio, chocolate lavender\n\nResults:\n\nAgain, we use the same dependent variable of Steph's level of euphoria (where 1 = I would rather eat dirt, and 10 = I could die right now and not give a crap):\n\n1) Chocolate cupcake with vanilla buttercream frosting: The cake is bittersweet chocolate (slightly on the dense and dry side) and topped with a soft kiss of vanilla butter cream frosting. Really - the frosting is like *eating* kisses. The kind that makes you want to go back over and over, dreaming of the soft and warm and velvety touch passing across your lips. Is this how buttercream is supposed to taste like? I have never tasted and experienced buttercream quite like this. That imagery stuck with me as I slowly savored this small-sized cupcake. Warm and fuzzies in full effect. DV = 9\n\n2) Gingerbread with cream cheese frosting: Also small and on the dense side. The taste of molasses and cloves is quite strong, even for gingerbread flavor. A surprisingly light cream cheese frosting provides nice balance to the sweet cake. I don't think I would have this again, but there are probably others who would experience more euphoria with this. DV = 7\n\n3) Chocolate with raspberry frosting: Very similar to the chocolate cupcake though I found this moister on this particular day. The frosting is just as light and kiss-like, with a smooth pink hue and strong raspberry flavor. I enjoyed Noe Valley Bakery's take on raspberry frosting more, with its flecks of raspberry preserves. Still, a solid cupcake. DV = 8\n\n4) Macarons: Not to be confused with macaroons (which are made with coconut flakes), macarons are traditional French pastries made with egg whites, ground almond flour and sugar. Various flavors of icings and spreads are spread between two little cookies. Miette features many different flavors, such as hazelnut, chocolate lavender, vanilla, strawberry, chocolate, pistachio, and rose vanilla).  They do these little tiny little indulgences ($1.50 each) very well.  When you bite into the 1.5-inch disc, you feel the tension between chewy and crunchy and a smooth nutty flavor combining with the potent flavor of the filling. I have tried these at Miette many times to try to assess reliability, and it seems that there are days when the macarons are fresher (and therefore more chewy than crunchy) than others. DV = 8\n\nDiscussion:\n\nAt about $3 for a small 2-inch cupcake, it seems that Miette's approach is to concentrate flavor into a more dense cupcake. Miette may suffer from the greater likelihood of a less moist cupcake with the smaller size. I personally find the flavors of the cake and the frosting to be good enough to make repeat visits to Miette potentially beneficial to my overall mental health. This little patisserie, fortunately, offers many other choices if cupcakes are not for you. The macarons seem to induce feelings of euphoria. With the many choices available for cupcake and macaron flavors, in addition to other offerings such as tartes, cookies, panna cotta and pudding, it would be reasonable to suggest that there is something for everybody. While their cupcakes may not be the best of the Bay, the evidence points to a happier post-Miette Steph.", "author": "Steph P."}

Everything in the shop looks like you could actually make it yourself, eat and enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAnd enjoy it you will.  Lovely seasonal fruit tartlets with clear, fresh flavors, mini scones, classic chocolate eclairs and homey cakes enrobed with Scharffenberger chocolate and fresh buttercreams with clever names like, Debutante, Bumblebee and Tomboy are sure to get your attention.  For small appetites, try the chocolate cupcakes topped with a dollop of perfect swirled buttercream, very light, with just the right amount of sweetness.\r\n\r\nThe french style macaroons are not to be missed, any pastry chef out there knows how difficult it is to get these airy confections just right, and the bakers at Miette have cracked it.  These wonderful almond cookies in flavors like classic chocolate, chocolate mandarin, coffee and others are the best outside Paris' famed Laduree, a world renown tea shop revered for their macaroons.  With the right amount of tender chewiness, and smooth buttercreams in the center, these cookies perfect for indulgent snacking, hostess gifts, tea parties or even wedding favors.\r\n\r\nMy favorite is the Chocolate Cream Cake, a very decadent slice of rich, silky chocolate ganache covered chocolate cake layered with a very light vanilla cream with crunchy cocoa nibs folded into it.  At $5.00 a slice, it is perfect to share as it is so rich with a cup of tea or a glass of Pinot Noir.  \r\n\r\nDrop by Miette, next time you want or need dessert for any occasion", "author": "Candace W."}

I come to the city often because my brother lives there and also because SF is one my favorite cities in the US and I love finding new dessert spots! I have no idea how I did not know about this gem but OH EM GEE am I stoked I tried it. Two words- GINGERBREAD CUPCAKE. This baby was voted top cupcake by food network in the world- YES THE WORLD! I just had to try this with those kinds of claims! The reviews do not lie, this cupcake is AMAZING. The cake is dense but not too overwhelming and the frosting is perfect. The flavor will blow your mind! It is a must try and in fact go out of your way to come here and try this cupcake! YUM! I also tried the vanilla ice cream sandwich and the macarons. The ice cream sandwich was okay, nothing to write home about and being a BIG macaron person I thought they were above average. The cookie is delicate and moist (yes I said the M word) but the cream is a lil too creamy for me. The rose was my favorite of the three I tried. Next time I come into the city I would like to try the gingersnap cookies as they have also been added to the top 100 foods before you die to try list.", "author": "Autumn Y."}

I decided that it would be \"Let's only go to places I've never been to before but always wanted to\" Day. I know you must all be thinking that I can't consider myself a true confectionery lover because I have never indulged in Miette Cakes before. It's not that I haven't tried to get my hands on their goodies. For some reason, they're always closed when I'm at the Ferry Building. I always believed it was some conspiracy against me. \n\nAnyways, even though we had just finished a hearty brunch, I needed my sweet fix and on this adventurous and spontaneous day, we headed over to Miette. We parked on the street across from the Ferry Building, and even on a Sunday, we were limited to 7.5 minutes per $0.25. We fed the meter $1.00 and had 30 minutes to run in and out of there. \n\nWe headed towards the pink sign and when we arrived in front of the case of perfect sweet creations, it was like a choir of angels were greeting me. Everything looked incredibly tooth-achingly delectable, but I restrained myself and choose only 2 treats: an adorable chocolate pot de creme (in a cute keepsake glass pot with Miette inscribed on it, which you can recycle back for $1 -- I kept mine of course) and a chocolate cupcake with buttercream frosting. Raoul also got a chocolate macaroon, and as we were on a time crunch, we fled over to the seating area next to Peet's to scarf down our chocolate goodies.

However, I got an email from Arnold G.:\n\"Pastrami and Cupcake.\"\n\nAnd I groaned and knew that my food eating would likely intensify two-fold, but I couldn't resist because food-events with Arnold are always lots of fun.  \n\nDuring our pastrami sandwich, we discussed in depth what can go wrong with cupcakes.  We agreed that the biggest problem is dryness: leave a cupcake out too long and it's stale, dry, and just unpalatable.  One can combat the problem by putting in oil, but that's just a shortcut that also cuts down on the buttery richness of cakes. So, bakeries are working against the nature of small individual cakes exposed to the air and elements.  The big plus of cupcakes can be a better ratio of frosting to cake than is offered in a traditional cake.\n\nSo after our pastrami sandwich, we went to Miette, eyed their cupcakes and decided on two different flavors, one vanilla with chocolate buttercream and chocolate with strawberry buttercream.  They had the cutest confectionary flowers, one each, on top of the frosting.\n\nMiette's cupcakes are $3, and worth every cent during lunchtime.  Moist, rich, and the butter cream frosting was decadent without having the hardness that I associate with butter frostings.  I feel that their buttercream frosting is probably either made with cream or a mix of butter and cream...it's certainly not the hard butter frosting that other places have and which makes the cupcake all wrong.\n\nSo, into the future a day, two other food events later: Steph shows up with a box of Miette macarons.  She's so sweet: she got the strawberry one specially for me.  Delicious, crumbly, and not too sweet.  A perfect cookie.  \n\nI am coming back more often.  Their chocolate pot de creme is $5...I figure it's a potential orgasm in a teeny cute glass pot.", "author": "Sooj O."}

The cases where the cakes and cupcakes were was crowded by people and it didn't seem that interesting.  They were tiny and overpriced.  I didn't feel like checking them out... maybe one day when I come on a non-Farmer's Market day I will give it a try.\n\nAfter some pondering I decided to give the caramels a try because I need new places to Yelp and write about in my blog! ^_^ So why not.  They are only 50 cents a piece and they are a tiny tiny piece that resembles salt water taffy but you get a lot less.  They also sold taffy but no flavors that would make me want to try.  I actually really enjoyed the chocolate and salted caramel.  As for the tea flavored one... that was odd and I didn't like that.  \n\nI still think that Boule in LA has a better salted caramel, but the ones here were not bad. They put the 3 tiny pieces in a cute lil bag and gave it to me.

I opted to go for a blueberry tart, a slice of the chocolate cream cake, a chocolate macaroon, and a chocolate madeleine.  \n\nI loved the tart--the custard was thick and rich and mildly flavored with vanilla--a perfect complement to the fresh blueberries, but what I appreciated the most was the tart pastry itself.  It had a great, not overly buttery flavor and even better yet, a great crumb--firm enough to support the custard, but tender enough to not require a steak knife to saw through.  Winner for sure.\n\nThe cream cake--not so much.  This will be a very unpopular comment, but I thought the cake tasted like a costco chocolate cake.  Costco chocolate cake happens to be pretty good--but this slice at Miette cost me about 1/4 of an entire sheet cake of costco.  The cream was good, but I also did not happen to like all the nibs riddled throughout the cake.  I don't mind a little crunch in my cake, for texture, but the amount of nibs was distracting and since it didn't add any additional flavor, I ended up spitting a lot of them out--luckily in the privacy of my own home.\n\nFinally the madeleine and the macaron were decent.  I'm glad I stopped by--my curiosity is satiated, and to be really honest, I'm kinda glad I'm not in love.

Do YOU know the difference?\nI don't. So here's what I discovered. \n\nPot de Creme = rich egg custard\n\nPudding = a solid mass thickened by using a grain product or other binding agent (egg, suet, blood)\n\nHmm. Based on these definitions, I have to say that I vote for Pot de Creme!! (sorry pudding!)\n\nEspecially if it's chocolate Pot de Creme from Miette.\nNot only is it creamy, and dark chocolaty, it's served in a super cute little jar that you can either keep (and use for sea salt, like I do) or return for a refund. Also, let me tell you, the jar's the perfect size for me to fit my finger to make sure I scoop out every last, creamy chocolaty, drop! (nope. no shame here.)\n\nBut the Pot de Creme wasn't how I met Miette. \nWe were introduced one birthday, where the lavender short bread cookies were elegantly presented to me as a gift. Those lovely little, square-cut morsels are crispy and light and buttery. You know, if I close my eyes and take a deep breath, I can almost smell the butter, the lavender-y goodness... Sadly, they're so amazing that I can't be trusted to keep them in the house, 'cause I'm sure to nibble away at the whole preciously-wrapped-in-cellophane bag in a matter of minutes. (yes, minutes. don't judge) It's embarrassing how little self-control I seem to have when Miette's lavender short bread's in the house!\n\nSo why only 4 stars if I'm so wow-ed by Miette? If you must know, I'm totally disappointed in their cupcakes. Were they too dry? Bland? Well? Hard to say. Maybe it wasn't really Miette's fault. I may need to blame Sibby's for this one, and give Miette another chance when Sibby's isn't so fresh in my memory. I'm looking forward to the day when I can say, \"Sibby's who?\" ...especially since Miette's a few short blocks away...\n\nUntil then, I guess I'll just have to keep researching Miette's cupcakes...or distracting myself from the cupcakes with Pot de Creme... or taunting my self-control with lavender short bread!\n\nThe things a girl's gotta do in the name of good eats.", "author": "Tiffinie T."}

I am a believer in both the frosting AND the cake being great in order to have a great cupcake. Unfortunately, on yesterday's chocolate cupcake with coffee frosting only the former was up to par. The cake was dry and not as flavorful as one would hope. There was a mob of people surrounding the deli case so the employees were understandably impatient, not knowing which people wanted to actually purchase something and which were just gawking. I still felt their barks should be kept to a minimum, though. \n\nI also tried the hazelnut chocolate macaron. What the hell is a macaron? is it like a macaroon? Because this didn't taste anything like a macaroon. It wasn't horrible and wasn't great. The chocolate orange one my mom ordered was slightly better. \n\nThe dark chocolate rocky road sweets were good but not great. Overall, I was just underwhelmed.", "author": "Jen S."}

Finding myself finally in front of their counter, I ordered just that: one Old Fashioned Cupcake and two macacroons, hazelnut and chocolate.\n\nThe macaroons are apparently Parisian style macaroons. I'll have to take their word for it since I've never been to Paris. In any case, they aren't the macaroons that most Americans are used to, overly sugared and mainly coconut. Miette's rendition is a delicate looking cookie sandwich but don't let the looks fool you -- it's a hardy cookie! I ate the hazelnut one first and immediately regretted that I hadn't bought more. The texture is delightfully chewy, the taste nutty and the hazelnut filling lovely. I ate the chocolate one later and was similarly delighted.\n\nThe Old Fashioned Cupcake, however, was a disappointment. It is a gorgeous, gorgeous piece of work. A perfect little cupcake, crowned with an impossibly high, whipped marshmallow-like icing, topped with a little red peanut. I wanted to love it and eat it. It was so perfect looking! So naturally, when I saw it before me, I had to have it. Unfortunately, I knew I wouldn't have the time to savor it properly at the Ferry Building as I had to get back to work so instead, I got it boxed up.\n\nBack at work, I opened the container to savor my cupcake. The icing had fallen to the side (no fault of Miette; I blame BART) but I scooped it out to savor anyway. I took one bite and...\n\nYuck. Was the cake supposed to be bitter? And was the frosting supposed to be sickeningly sweet? A quick check of the website confirmed that, yes, the cake was supposed to be 'bittersweet' and offset by the frosting. I ate my way through the cupcake, later switching to a fork in hopes that I could effectively offset the bitterness of the cake with the sweetness of the frosting. Nope, it wasn't to be. From first to last, the bitterness of the cake overrode everything. Talk about disappointing! \n\nI'd go back to Miette for the macaroons but I'll leave the cupcakes for a more unsuspecting soul. The fact that everything is organic is a real plus but the taste... come on, man! If I'm going to pay $3 for a freaking cupcake when I could make a dozen at home for about the same price, you better be damn sure that it's worth my money. And it's not. On the plus side, the store itself is quite cute as are the paper bags. At least I got my $3 worth out of a paper bag I can now tote my lunch in to look cool. *snort* Give me Satura over Miette any day.", "author": "Michelle N."}

Perhaps it's because the shop--particularly the cakes and the case that house them--are reminiscent of artist Wayne Theibaud's paintings. This is on purpose, as one of the owners has a background in art and is a huge Wayne Theibaud fan. She wanted to make cakes like the ones in his paintings. \r\n\r\nConceptually, Miette--a french styled organic patisserie, is extremely clever. Their products are unique, rich and sinful--not to mention organic, too.  The counter staff are always warm & friendly--no attitude here. The lemon tart, after tingling in your mouth, will send you on the biggest sugar rollercoaster you've ever been on.

(i'm also giving up my ufc ratings.) decided to give them another shot, so i ordered a gingerbread cupcake and chocolate madeleine. i made sure to watch the girl this time and i did get the madeleine and not a silly macaron.\n\ni tried the madeleine first and was surprised by its size and flavor. it was at least 150% the size of typical madeleines which makes it closer to being worth $0.75, i guess. further, it didn't taste like a pure chocolate madeleine; i think i detected a hint of orange essence? maybe, but i wouldn't mind going back for another.\n\nthe gingerbread cupcake however was a disappointment. the frosting was overly sweet and the cake portion had such an overpowering ginger flavor. sure, that makes it a true gingerbread cupcake, but whoa, flavor overload.\n\ni think i'd only ever come back for the chocolate madeleines and to look at the pretty displays. and oh, the girl this time was much nicer. she saw that i had a brown bag lunch from another place and she offered me a small shopping bag so i'd be able to carry my things more easily. how nice.\n\n7/26/06 Original 2-Star Review:\nI'm so dissatisfied I could punch a wall.  I walked all the way over to miette to check out their cupcakes.  But cupcakeS, I did not find.  Their selection of cupcakes was old-fashioned, old-fashioned, or old-fashioned.  Seriously, in the middle of the day during tourist season?  You must be kidding me.  But fine, I bought one anyway since you'd expect not to have any issues with a classic.  And I saw some chocolate madeleines (which I haven't seen anywhere else), so I asked for two.\n\nThe cake half of the cupcake was boring.  Tasted mass-produced.  The icing though, which I spread to each bite with a knife, was nice.  It really did taste like marshmallows, but a tad sweet.  Not necessarily a cupcake I'd go back to get.  Seriously, tasted like a Hostess ho ho or a Sheng Kee chocolate roll cake.  Only difference was that it was {buzzword of the 21st century} organic.  And it was so small I reached for my madeleines.\n\nBUT ... when I opened up the bag, what did I find??  Chocolate macarons!  Stupid girl behind the counter with the glazed over eyes who didn't even look at me while I ordered, but instead stared off into nowhere gave me stupid macarons!  I asked for madeleines!!  I figured I'd try it anyway.  Overly sweet and sticky.  Not my kind of dessert/pastry.  I'm giving my second one to someone else.\n\nThey're only getting that second star for having a cute store complete with apothecary jars and pink & silver stickers.

While all their frostings are delicious, the cakes themselves tend towards being sort of dry and crumbly. I did buy a gingerbread cake for Thanksgiving which was tasty, but really not worth $25.\n\nAlso, a PSA to all of you Yelpers: places like Miette, which say they have a $10 credit card minimum, **CANNOT** be held to this. It's a breach of contract with the credit card companies, and they can be reported for it. They are obligated to take the card even for a $0.25 purchase.

I feel this gives me the ability to write an honest review with taste, atmosphere and price taken into account.\n\nOccasion  1: Mary brings back rose geranium meringues to the office. They were light, subtle, not overly sweet, and just the right crispness. However, I found out later this tiny bag of meringues was $3.50 for something that was AT MOST 1 egg white for the entire bag of MAYBE 20 tiny meringues. Holy crap.\n\nOccasion 2: There are cupcakes in the office from Miette, also courtesy of Mary. I found the cake a bit dry and the frosting crusty at room temperature, alluding to the fact that it's either made from shortening or with too much sugar. I discovered on my trip today that those cupcakes were $3 something each for a sub-par cupcake. I'll pay a little extra for a cake from Love at First Bite, http://www.yelp.com/biz/love-at-first-bite-berkeley#hrid:B31Z6FVW1zAzOVhcSZisog\nbut not from here...\n\nOccasion 3 (today): Passed by Miette and payed 75 cents for a madeline. It was soft, light and cake-like (so many are more of a cookie texture). I must say, it was a nice dessert for my meal at Acme, and it was almost worth the 75 cents... almost.\n\nOverall: overpriced and overrated. Cute packaging and nice atmosphere, but not worth the money. Only reason they get 3 stars instead of 2 is because the madelines are actually very good, and the desserts are presented very nicely.

I was a big fan of their cupcakes.\n\nHowever, I had a really bad experience with ordering cakes for someone's birthday. The ordering part wasn't so hard, and they do make you pay for your order ahead of time. I specified what I wanted, said when I was going to pick it up (Saturday morning) and was looking forward to bringing them along for a birthday brunch.\n\nThe reality was much different. There was a long line on Saturday morning of people waiting to get served. I tried to side-step directly to the register only to have one of the counter people snarl at me to \"get in line.\" Okay. Fine. I waited in line. But the surly waitstaff decided to punish me by ignoring me when it was my turn.\n\nI finally got someone's attention and specified I was there to pick up two cakes. She told me I had to have ordered them ahead of time. I produced my receipt. She went to fetch the cakes. And then asked how I was going to pay for them. I said, there shouldn't be a balance, there's a Visa receipt attached to the order receipt. She disagreed. It took a few minutes to convince her that the $100 for both cakes was already taken care of.\n\nSo I took the cakes along to the restaurant, and they were served after the meal. And they were AWFUL. They were only an approximation of the chocolate and lemon cake I had ordered. When I called the bakery and asked about my order, I was told rather tartly that they don't do special orders: they make certain items, and my order was approximated in that they decided which items best fit my specifications. Why didn't they tell me that in the first place? The cakes themselves were dense like sugared concrete and slightly less edible. I felt terrible for the birthday girl and everyone else at the brunch. These miserable expensive cakes weren't worth the flour and sugar that went into them.\n\nDo yourself a favor. Try them at least once, but count on them for nothing.", "author": "Ingrid J."}

If you have never had it, get it here.  The amount they give you is small but perfect for the intensity of the cream and flavor.  The little jar that it came in just topped off the overall presentation. Miette sure knows how to play to off the eyes! \n\nOld Fashioned Cupcakes: How could I resist a chocolate cupcake with a cloud of frosting sitting a top?!!

All the desserts are beautifully displayed and packaged in the cutest containers. With that said, I was terribly disappointed with the macarons. I was surprised to see that their macarons weren't the usual brightly colored ones. They were more tan with brown specks, but I took this to suggest that perhaps they were more organic and the others were dyed with food coloring. The disappointment was not from the appearance, but rather when I took the first bite. The brown specks were grainy and ruined the wonderful chewiness that is associated with macarons. The filling was also bland and none of the strawberry flavor came through. I'll be admiring the patisserie items from afar the next time I'm in the Ferry Building. Maybe it's just better to look at rather than taste. Let's hope that it was just a bad macaron batch.", "author": "Diana H."}

The scharfenberger burger cake thingy, was good. Nice and chocolatey. The chocolate truffle tart was ok, the chocolate was bitter. Which usually would be fine, except that it wasn't very smooth like the inside of a truffle should be. The tart crust was nice and flaky though. The lime meringue tart was good, the lime part was tart. The meringue was a marshmallow and may be too much if you don't have a big sweet tooth. Again, the crust was good. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high from all the hype. The items I had this time were average.

I also ordered two each of their wonderful, light and airy, not to mention fantastic Parisian macaroons.  I couldn't wait to get home to try them all.\n\nThe most memorable experience that I had at this place was the customer service. The girl behind the counter who seemed friendly at first glance was nothing but a front. I caught her rolling her eyes as she turned away from me to get a box then quickly flashed a smile as she faced me again. She did this several times as I placed my order.  It was as if I was making her work too hard placing my cupcakes, cakes, and macaroons in the box. All I can say is what a RUDE ass! They need to train their sales people with some customer service, class, and tact.\n\nIn the end, despite the fact that I did enjoy my lovely treats, I don't think I will ever come back here again just to dodge their horrible sales service.

I am not sure if the quality of the macarons have declined or if I am just no longer satisfied with Miette's macarons because I've now had better from several difference places. I tried them once a few years ago and thought they were great. Went back today and found them to be extremely disappointing. \n\nThey're ok, I guess. because it would be hard to make them taste bad (except for the rose one, the rose flavor was way too strong). But the flavors just seemed off, despite the fact that they were all very sweet. The flavors are either too strong (like the rose) or too bland. I ordered one of each and, later, couldn't pick out some of the flavors. Rose was obvious, I am pretty sure which was the chocolate lavender (but might not have been able to identify the lavender if I hadn't known it was there), plain chocolate and the raspberry, but the other ones...no idea. \n\nThey were also too cakey or something. Just not the delicate experience they should be. Honestly, I felt like they were just mass produced crap for people who have never had a really good macaron.\n\nAlso, what is up with the crappy customer service?

As sharing is caring. I distributed amongst my coworkers and friends throughout the day.  After having dinner at Nola's in Palo Alto, I wanted to surprise my Palo Alto natives with a \"TREAT\".  \n\nI prewarned my friends and said,\n\n \" look, this is the most DELICIOUS dessert I've ever had, yet so tiny.

I've never had macarons elsewhere so I don't have anything to compare them to but I can't imagine better tasting ones.  Biting into one is akin to biting into a glazed Krispy Kreme donut (and boy do I love those!), except 100x better because they're chewy!  So whenever I go to the Ferry Building, I have to stop by Miette for some to satisfy my cravings.  (By the way, they're still $1.50 each so I'm not sure why everyone else is saying they're $1.75.)\n\nI just found out today that they rotate the flavors of their macarons every few months!  The last few times they had: pistachio, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, coffee, raspberry and lemon.  Today's flavors: pistachio, vanilla, hazelnut, chocolate, rose germanium, chocolate orange and one other flavor I can't remember right now.  That reminds me, I wish they would color code their macarons or figure out some way to differentiate between the flavors.  Of course, I always buy one (or a few of each) and it's so hard to figure out which flavor is which until you bite into them.\n\nAnyway, I also tried their Gingerbread Cupcake with cream cheese frosting  ($3) today.  The cake itself was super moist and perfectly spiced...I think it's the best ginger spiced cake I've ever had.  The cream cheese frosting was kind of gross by itself but it was just perfect with the cupcake.  The only complaint I have is that the cupcake had way too much frosting, which I don't like.  Other than that, it was delicious.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the price of their goodies but I don't think it's too outrageously priced.

If only everything wasn't so expensive!  We got a pack of 6 small marshmallows for $5.  The sweet fluffy pillows or sugary air tasted too similar to a bag of marshmallows you would find at your local grocer.  Their French macaroons looked tasty but unimaginative.  We bought one of each flavor and came to find out when we got home that it was near impossible to tell which was which.

The shop is so cute, and their presentation of everything is impeccable!  Everything looked so good that hubby and I were so tempted to take home one of each item that they had.\n\nBut we exercised restraint and stuck to trying some of their macarons.  Had both the pistachio and the hazelnut.  They were fresh and tender, but yet, struck me as just \"meh.\"  They were too sweet for my taste, and the sugary-ness actually over-powered the subtle flavors of the cookies.  In fact, hubby had initially thought they had accidentally given us chocolate macarons instead of the hazelnut, because the nuttiness was too understated.  It would have been nice if the cookies had a little more \"pop\" taste-wise.  But for just $1.75 each, it was still a worthwhile investment.  It just wasn't the best I've ever had.", "author": "Jane Y."}

You pay $4 for the panna cotta, if you ate it there, you can give them back a jar, and get refunded $1, which was kinda odd. They should probably consider having a package that cost less, which will bring the overall price down instead of the cute little glass jar. The Eclair was disappointing. The filling was delicious, very light, and at a good balance for the sweetness. I did not, however, like the choux pastry was not as crispy nor as light and crunchy as i liked.

I chose 3 cupcakes which were, lemon, chocolate raspberry, and gingerbread I believe. I also got a rose macaroon which was divine. The cupcakes themselves were moist and not offensively sweet to my sensitive palate. My only complaint, and I know I'm in the vast minority here, I think there was too much frosting. I wound up scooping about half of it off and throwing it away. A travesty in many people's mind I'm sure.

Then, just when you think life can't get any better, take a bite of Miette's fabulous gingerbread cupcake.  Don't be fooled by its small stature and simple adornment!  This little confection is a spicy-sweet suckerpunch made from dark stout beer, molasses, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon and cardamom, and finally topped with an unbelievably buttery cream cheese frosting.\r\n\r\nMiette's Parisian macarons provide an equally delicious contrast to their cupcakes: thin layers of delicate filling sandwiched between two light-as-a-cloud miniature cookies, all glazed and available in several flavors (hazelnut being the best, in my opinion). \r\n\r\nFortunately for all hungry San Franciscans, this Ferry Building bakery lives up to it's 55-review hype.

Cupcakes: I brought some cupcakes to a small bday party and everyone loved them.  There was vanilla, chocolate, and gingerbread.  They were all really really good.  Soft, moist, sweet, the frosting was creamy and just the right amount of sweetness, not crazy sugary like some places.  The frosting just complimented the cupcake really well.\n\n2. French Macaroons: not to sound snobby, but the last time I had macaroons like this was at this patisserie in Paris where we had to stand in line for 40 minutes.  These are so yummy!  Slightly crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside, and the flavors are so good.  I've had chocolate orange, vanilla, lavender, pistachio, but I really don't think you can go wrong.

That said, they get it right here.\n\nMy two personal favorites are the Old Fashioned Cake and the French Macaroons (macarons).  They are well constructed and the ingredients are top notch.  You can taste all the elements without having to mask them with other things to make them fancy.\n\nMost cakes today especially get heavy handed with frosting to mask what the cake tastes like.  I like the distinct flavor pairings of both.  They should compliment each other not overwhelm.  \n\nThis is my non-stop flight to Paris when I need my fix for macarons and coffee.  Everytime I see the Miette bags coming out of the Ferry building it makes me a little anxious my \"supply will be cut off\". These are quietly addicting even for the non sweet tooth. \n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Holly J."}

Expensive, gourmet desserts that would go nicely as a gift or something for you to indulge on yourself. Their packaging would go front-page on the dieline blog - even the signs noting the different foods have a very personal touch to them. Okay, but that's presentation - what about taste?\n\nI've ordered their macaroons before and they are worth every penny. I don't think I could ever come close to making them as sweet and yummy as Miette does.\n\nI came here for ginger snaps today and while I wasn't blown away on first bite, over time, the ginger snaps grew on me. The package ($7 for 12 ginger snaps) was a bit pricey for me, but they were fresh, had a thorough amount of ginger, and were extremely crisp. There are other cookies they make and of course the macaroons, so I'd come back for the macaroons instead of the snaps.", "author": "Reid Y."}

My friend was telling me about how great they are and that she had some at the Ferry Building so I had to try them out for myself. Miette Patisserie is an adorable shop in the Ferry Building over by the gelato shop and Blue Bottle Coffee. The macarons were inside jars by the cashier. Compared to others I have seen, these seem smaller in size. I decided on chocolate, pistachio and vanilla. There isn't really a dedicated space for eating your macarons in the Ferry Building so I took mine outside and across the way to Justin Herman Plaza. I sat there and watched people walking and skateboarding and eating concrete while others drove off towards the Bay Bridge. I couldn't tell the difference between the pistachio and the vanilla but I loved them both. I didn't like the chocolate much.  These are a great little treat to accent both good days and bad.

The small diameter cake, though it serves 6-8 people, looks kind of tiny on a buffet table, so order ahead and get the larger cake. The customer service is very, very good. \n\nThe Scharffen Berger chocolate cake is dense, dark-chocolately and delicious, with a not-too-sweet chocolate ganache covering. It's a really sophisticated version of chocolate cake-- the opposite of, say, a Hostess Cupcake. \n\nThe Princess cake is so pretty it hurts, but it doesn't taste all that great. \nBased on the description, I really wanted to try it, so for a friend's recent birthday I got this, plus the Scharffen Berger cake. There was a very thin layer of some delicious raspberry substance, and  I thought it could have been thicker, because it was the only part of the cake that wasn't super-duper sweet. The lovely green white chocolate fondant icing was thick, sticky and, in my opinion, too sweet, and just sweet-- not complex tasting at all.\n\nMiette's gingerbread cake and lemon tart  are the most delicious things they offer. The gingerbread cake is dense, moist, dark, gingery, and topped with cream cheese frosting... yum. The lemon filling in the tart is smooth, tangy and delicious, and the crust is flaky, buttery and perfect! \n\nTry the little Parisian macarons, too. They're crisp, light, chewy and yummy... my mom loves them so much that I mail order them to her for Mothers Day, and when I need to apologize to her. And if you like the Parisian macarons at Miette, then you should also try the pignoles at Dianda's Italian American Bakery on Mission St. (The pignoles have the crisp-chewy almondy deliciousness of Miette's macarons, but are even more toothsome, plus they're sprinkled with pine nuts!)", "author": "Dani Y."}

These were not that awesome though, and were not BURSTING with special peaNUT BUTTer flavor like my own homemade p-NUT BUTTer cookies.  The SECRET SAUCE of good peaNUT BUTTer COOKIES is DUMPing in a SIXTEEN oz. bag of peaNUT BUTTer chips into the DOugh.  Much richer and CREAMIER that way.  The COOKIES' mediocrity did not stop me from SUCKING them all up last night as I LAY on the cOUCH in my UNDERWEAR.\n\nFinally, I had to pick up a CREME DOUCHE scone.

Instead, it looked like they had all the standards: chocolate with a chocolate frosting, vanilla with a vanilla frosting, and spice cake with a cream cheese frostng and always the enticing but deadly red velvet with a cream cheese frosting.  Since my wife won't touch a red velvet, we settled on the Old Fashioned, because it had an Italian Meringue frosting.\n\nThe Old-Fasioned, was a chocolate cupcake, most and tender but completely plain, no fun frosting in the middle or anything, and the vanilla Italian Meringue was very sweet.  Of course I was expecting that and I enjoyed it, but my wife said it was too sweet for her.

Each one packed a nice punch of flavor. Much more than you would expect. I loved these so much! They are very sweet though which I wasn't expecting, so you can't eat too many. Next I tried the gingerbread cupcake since it was touted as being one of their most popular ones. It was a tasty cupcake, but honestly it tasted more like a pumpkin cake than gingerbread. I wish it would have had more ginger taste. The cream cheese frosting however was delicious! Lastly, I had a slice of the raspberry creme cake. This was delicious, but nothing too crazy special. The white cake was moist and the raspberry creme was delicately flavored and nice and light. The whipped cream on top was super fresh and light tasting as well.

I mean, if you don't like cake or just aren't a dessert person generally, that's one thing.  But if you like cake, how can cupcakes not be even better?  They are portable.  They are the right size so you can buy one portion at a time.  Everyone can have their own flavor and no one gets the piece that is all frosting and no cake.  Cupcakes:  timeless, ageless, wonderful.\n\nOkay.  The people at Miette are super nice, which comes as a bit of a surprise given how hip the place seems.  And Miette's cupcakes are so gorgeous it's like walking into a Wayne Thiebaud painting -- a longtime fantasy, natch.  Sadly, they just don't taste that great.  They are light and fluffy and very fresh.  But they are just kind of flavorless.  I want to love the Old-Fashioned Cupcake in particular (the way that I love the Signature Cupcake at Citizen Cake) but I just need more cupcakey goodness under that pretty exterior.\n\nIt's not that I can't be swayed by externalities.

The lemon curd was a delight...tart and sweet and still creamy (though personally I would've liked it to be just a tad more tart, I like my lemon curd to be really tart).  I did not like the small 'miette\" paper tag that was placed in the middle of my tart to display the bakery's name.  When I removed it my fingers had to dig into my tart some and the paper took some of my lemon curd upon removal :(\n\nI also tried the French Macaroons which I did not enjoy (and it should definitely be noted these are my favorite cookies ever!)  I found them to be a tad but too dry and I didn't enjoy the added texture.\n\nOverall a great place.

Luckily I had one a few weeks ago, not realizing the pending deadline! I recently tried a chocolate cake/chocolate frosting cupcake & found it enjoyable as well. Moist cake, yummy frosting that is not too sweet. Best to eat them right away or at room temperature...I mistakenly refridgerated one once & it hardened the frosting, & took away from the enjoyment of the cupcake.\n\nA friend & I recently tried their Parisienne macaroons (which I never would have tried, since I don't like traditional coconut macaroons) & was delighted at the experience. Made w/almond meal, it's like a combination of a cookie & a brownie...chewy, crunchy texture with interesting flavors including the creamy middle of some.

But I believe they rotate out some of the ones as seasonal.. I will def. be back to try their other flavors.  Now I gotta try their other items.  The macarons have instilled trust for me for this bakery.  \n*****************************\nEverything looks good and pricey.  I tried the elcair and it's the best eclair that i've had for the longest time.  Maybe it's the location, or maybe they are supposed to be really good, but the pricing is high.  Maybe that's how much you really pay for good dessert?  Their Sharffen Berger creme pot was $5, but Absinthe sells the same thing for about $8 and it's helluva bigger pot.  I'm not saying that they are not good, just pricey, but give it a try when you're in the area.  \n\nGood quality desserts are hard to find and you can tell that they are good when they don't load it with tons of sugar.  You can separate the taste in your mouth.  The eclair had three, the creme, the chocolate and the bread itself.  Temperature was kept perfect as well.  Not too cold so that it makes the bread all hard nor too warm so that the chocolate is melting.  Like i said, quality.  But do you want to pay the price??

At $5 per bombe/tart, it was pretty steep, but I've been known to pay exorbitant prices for good dessert (neither my waistline nor my wallet is very happy with me). \n\nDESSERT:\nBANANA CREAM TART\nI thought it was just gonna be banana custard and whipped cream, but nooo, there was a layer of chocolate on the bottom, on top of this delicious shortbread crust. It was really tasty. Not overly sweet, nor too rich tasting, but enough of both to give a nice mouth feel and to make me want another one right away. And the chocolate-banana combo is just classic. \n\nSCHRAFFEN-BERGER CHOCOLATE BOMBE\nChocolate dome cake covered with bittersweet chocolate ganache - it was rich and decadent.  The chocolate cake wasn't as dense as I expected (or dreaded) and together with the smooth ganache came just shy of being overpowering. I really like that their products aren't too sweet, just enough to make them taste good while still preserving the natural flavor of the ingredients. And extra points for using a local chocolate :)\n\nGERANIUM ROSE  MACAROON and PISTACHIO VANILLA MACAROON\nTexture-wise, not my favorite but still good. The flavor of the geranium rose is great. \n\nOVERALL: Cute place located in the Ferry Market, many varieties of macaroons, great cakes and tarts immaculately presented.

But so worth it...!!!\nOn our way to Mendocino we stopped at the Ferry Building to load up on good stuff for our little beach picnic. I decided to get an eclair for dessert.  It must have been a call from above - from the patissier heaven if there is one, and it'd better should be. I am French and frankly Miette's eclair was the best I have had in my entire life. The chocolate frosting was rich, thick and very flavorful. I mean it tasted like chocolate - and not like some kind of colored-sugar you too often find in bakeries in France. The crust was close to perfection - a perfect balance of chewy and crusty, great texture. And the filling....well...you'll have to find out by yourself. As we say in the \"eclair country\" - \"le petit Jesus en culotte de velours\" (baby Jesus in velvet underwear...don't ask)\nIt was so overwhelming that I had to go back on my last day to get another one and share it with my man.\nThank you Miette!", "author": "Aurore L."}

The frosting was the best frosting I've ever had, it was fresh and not at all thick and overwhelming like most frostings. The cake itself was good but I felt like it lacked in flavor....\n\nThen I had the chocolate cake with vanilla buttercream frosting. Again, the frosting was delicious, best ever! The cake itself was way too chocolatey, and I love chocolate but It was surprisingly too powerful in flavor, I couldn't finish the cake too strong.... My brother got the same one and couldn't finish the cake because it was too intense, he agreed that the frosting was the best! \n\nLastly, I got the packaged $5 walnut cookies. First off I don't know if they are meant to be like this but they are salty. They still taste good and they have a nice buttery flavor. Great with milk or tea or by themselves, downside is that they are salty. I gave one to my brother and he immediately said \"they're salty\", and then I gave one to my sister and she immediately said \"why are they salty?\" We just agreed that that's just how they are but nonetheless they are still tasty, just a bit salty...\n\nOverall from what I've had at this place I give it three out of five stars.\nI wish I would have tried their macaroons although I was in a hurry to go and forgot to get some...next time though.", "author": "Jack F."}

In addition to the macarons (hazelnut, vanilla, and pistacio) I bought, I also got a chocolate pot de creme.  First off with the chocolate pot de creme, it completely paled in comparison with the earl grey pot de creme from Bouchon in Napa.  Miette's one just didn't have the right consistency.  It tasted like a diluted chocolate mousse.  So not worth the $5 bucks!\n\nOn the other hand, the macarons tasted good.  The cookies were chewy and moist and the cream filling wasn't too thick.  Until I try out a few other macarons from other patisseries, I would recommend it to my friends.  One thing I think Miette can improve on is their packaging.  The store is nicely decorated but when I asked for a bag to take my goodies with me, I was offered a brown bag! yes, a brown bag that kids would use to bring their lunch to school! And not to mention, the pot de creme was placed in a chinese to go style container! Also, unlike the macarons I know of that the cookies and filling are the same flavor (for example, red cookies and filling for raspberry, green cookies and filling for pistachio, white cookies and filling for vanilla, etc...), Miette's macarons have the same flavor (I believe) cookies for all the various creme fillings.  Since the sales placed all my macarons in one small bag, I couldn't tell apart from the vanilla macaron and pistacio macaron.  Obviously, the only one that I can tell apart is the hazelnut because the filling was dark brown.  Perhaps Miette can produce their signature stickers with the flavor imprinted on it and the sales can place each macaron in a tiny individual bag and sealed with the sticker, that way, the macaron is nicely presented to the customers with no mistake on which flavor they are trying out.\n\nTwo stars for the macarons.", "author": "Shirley H."}

I picked up 2 cause I thought my husband would like one!\nBe warned, $3/cupcake and they take a minimum charge of $10 for debit/credit cards. Of course I dont carry cash with me when I run, but I did have my card. There was no sign stating mimimum purchase for credit card purchases. I told the lady who was helping me I only had my debit card, but I can get cash if she pointed me to one. Boy, for someone who works at the ferry building for who knows how long...she didn't know any atms around. But she was kind enough to make my $6 purchase an exception.\nAfter I left there, just a a few yards away was a Bofa ATM!  okay I thought that was just dumb, on my part and hers!", "author": "Mauling W."}

I know, you're asking, \"but Shannon, then, why the four stars,\" and I would tell you, kind inquisitor, that while their cake was outrageous, their buttercream frosting was of the dense BUTTER and less cream variety.

When it was dry and flavorless I assumed it must be a fluke.  Months later I shared a few of their Madelines with a friend and was similarly disappointed. Recently I needed to order cakes for an office party, and since Miette is nearby and I was using the company card I thought I'd give them one last chance to redeem themselves.  I ordered four cakes:  Gingerbread, a Lemon Debutante, a Bumblebee, and a Tomboy cake with seasonal strawberry buttercream.  Although every person who walked into the room immediately commented on how beautiful the cakes were, I have to say only the Gingerbread, which is, according to the menu, their \"all-time best selling cake\" would be worth returning to.  The other cakes were dense and dry and completely unremarkable.  I find it extremely disappointing that a business with such a beautiful aesthetic and great philosophy would not go all the way and actually create an awesome product.", "author": "Leti R."}

Most of the time, they just can't live up to the hype.  The gingerbread cupcake that I had after lunch at the Ferry Building was pretty frickin' good though.  Very tasty and super moist.  The cream cheese frosting was not the usual super sweet kind either.  Mmmmm delicious!", "author": "Michelle Y."}

THE EVENT of the century. the pressure was on. last week my girlfriend melissa and i celebrated our birthdays together by throwing a huge joint birthday bash. we invited all of our favorite friends so we wanted things to go well.... in the planning stages we both agreed on our (2) top priorities. we wanted the perfect venue-- and a truly decadent cake to serve our friends. well, we found the venue immediately..... but only after some extensive research did we finally find Miette Cakes.(thanks to Yelp)  we poured over the pictures on the website trying to find the best one.... too many choices, we got nervous. we started to sweat. the room got dizzy..... we finally chose the 3 layer cake with vanilla buttercream frosting. unfortunately (or fortunately!) we had so many of our friends show up we didn't have enough cake for everyone. the good news is, after a few drinks most people forgot about the cake...... we were really worried there would be a bar riot or food fight or something over it. i mean, you never know..... anyway, all turned out great. michelle and melissa were satisfied, the birds started singing, rainbows appeared and they had an awesome birthday party....... all was good in the world that night. if you want an impressive cake to serve at your next special occasion, go straight to Miette and don't pass GO. once you get a taste you'll know what i mean. mmmm.", "author": "Michelle I."}

Waiiiiit, here's Miette. Adorned with confections, pastries, cakes, and other dulcet treats, her charms overpower and yes, you must stop. Waiting patiently while others seek staff recommendations and make their purchase, you think, \"is it really a good idea to get both the plain AND walnut shortbreads. maybe i can give this to so-and-so as a stocking stuffer (knowing full well it may not last until the next night).\" When the interminable minute of waiting finally ends, you find yourself hypnotically asking about one of the glorious cakes in the glass case in front of you, which moments ago you thought were way out of the realm of possible purchases. As you carry away your new bag, the clamor and rush of shoppers around you seem to drift away with the promise of a confectionary affair to remember.", "author": "Geo G."}
