But locals like me can also get their fix here because the line never seems as long here as it does inside. As true Blue Bottle aficionados know, ambiance is key to the appeal of their stores, and the outdoor arcade has an architectural appeal about it. It also helps that you don't have to fight the crowds inside the building on a busy weekend. All bets are off, however, when the Farmers Market is happening and foot traffic multiplies. I try to avoid the area then as I'm usually here waiting to meet Jamie W. and want some kind of libation.\n\nMore often than not, I have ordered the $4 Iced Cold Brew just because the al fresco setting lends itself to something cold and refreshing (photo: http://bit.ly/2wZ2pRz). Besides it's not as calorific as the New Orleans Iced Coffee which comes in that milk carton where I keep looking for a photo of a lost child. I'm not sure if they make their Belgian waffles, affogatos, or other acts of decadence here anymore, but it's just as well I don't know as I don't need those calories either. I usually take it to go since Jamie isn't much of a coffee drinker, and we just stroll the waterfront on sunny weekends. Nice to know I have this quality caffeine option in such a tourist-infested area.\n\nCOFFEE - 4 stars...mostly iced, mostly Blue Bottle quality\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...on a sunny day, just fine...on a not-so-sunny day, still good\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...surprisingly faster than the other stores in the chain\nTOTAL - 4 stars...this arcade is indeed a true arcadia", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-04", "description": "Blue Bottle Coffee has two locations inside the Ferry Building, hence the two listings on Yelp. This location is a corner stall located on the north end of the building. There are two counters to order from. The other location can be found across the arcade closer to the main entrance of the building. That location has a tasting room which features flights of coffee (and heated seats). Both locations offer espresso drinks, pour over coffee, and pastries.\n\nBlue Bottle is based across the bay in Oakland. The company is known for its high quality single-origin coffee which is prepared in small batches. It's a shining example of \"third wave coffee\" which is pretty much gourmet artisanal coffee where special attention is paid to each and every step of the coffee-making process, from sourcing to roasting to preparation. Coffee connoisseurs (and hipsters/snobs) love this place.\n\nThe menu at the stand was short and sweet:\n\n* House espresso (Hayes Valley) and single-origin espresso - $3 each\n* Macchiato - $3.50\n* Cappuccino - $4.00\n* Caffe latte - $4.50\n* Caffe mocha - $5.00\n* Affogato (espresso over ice cream) - $5.50\n* Drip coffee: Three Africas - $3.50, Ethiopia - $4.50\n* Cold brew iced coffee: Three Africas - $4.00, New Orleans - $4.00\n* Almond milk added to any drink - $1.00\n* Cascara fizz (cascara syrup, soda, lemon) - $4.00\n* Samovar tea - $3.00\n* Hot chocolate (made with TCHO chocolate) - $4.00\n* Liege Wafel - $4.00\n\nI had a latte with almond milk and it was delicious. The coffee tasted like it was meticulously prepared from organic direct-trade beans supplied by a lone farmer and his specific harvest micro lot. Just kidding. I have no idea what I'm talking about. I like coffee, but am no connoisseur nor do I have a discerning palate for specialty coffees. Generally, coffee from chains will make me just as satisfied as the latte I had here, which was quite good (warm and it hit the spot). It even came with one of those artistic leafy designs on top.\n\nIf you're visiting the Ferry Building and/or Embarcadero and want a cup of coffee or need some caffeine, Blue Bottle is definitely worth checking out.\n\nGreat service.\n\nOutside of the Bay Area, Blue Bottle Cafes can be found in New York, LA, and Tokyo.", "author": "Daniel B."}

My husband ordered a decaf cappuccino and asked for a Splenda. I don't remember what size he ordered, but I think he asked for the smallest size (8 or 12 oz).  The hipster cashier lady said, \"We don't have that size for that drink\" without suggesting an available size for his drink. So my husband asked for whatever the next size up is. The hipster cashier lady replied, \"We don't have Splenda, we only have organic cane sugar\" without asking if he would like that instead. So my said sure, he'll have that. Lines were long within five minutes of opening, and even longer by the time my husband received his drink. \n\nOverall: This location is very touristy. Blue Bottle overall is extremely hipster and trendy, very into organic everything. It's not for everyone.\n\nTip for Chase Sapphire Preferred and Reserve cardholders: Places that use Square to process payments usually do not process your purchases as Dining (confirmed by Chase customer service) so you will not receive your bonus earn.

Useful for when you just want coffee and aren't interested in the line at the blue bottle location inside the ferry building. Because it's a walk up, it doesn't have the range of pastry options other locations have. You will basically be restricted to four-five choices which vary daily but could best be described as what you see is what you get.\nThe coffee products are the exact same quality that you find at any blue bottle, but with half the wait. Awesome for when you are in a hurry.\nThere's a few picnic tables across from the ordering/delivery window and while they do offer shelter from the sun and rain, they are not the epitome of luxury. Also at times the staff won't be especially diligent about keeping the coffee additives(located outside the walkup on a bench)-creamer, sugar, sugar substitute et al. as stocked up as it could be.It's no trouble to ask for what you don't see at the counter though.\nStill the best and quickest option if you are wanting some basic blue bottle goodness in a line free enviroment.", "author": "Steven W."}

I had to pay my dues, as a loss a bet last semester, so our first stop was In-N-Out Burger.  It may seem like an ordinary place to eat - but not when you live across the ocean!\n\nI decided to be touristy, so we made our way to the Ferry Building for some Blue Bottle Coffee, one of San Francisco's famous coffee roasters.  They have several locations across San Francisco, but I'd have to say my most frequented would be the one located in the Ferry Building (Embarcardero), because there you also have access to Miette's delicious macarons!\n\nBlue Bottle offers a variety of organic, non-pesticide beans, as well as coffee gadgets to brew your coffee just the way you like.  They also offer those options in-shop, and I hear the New Orleans Iced Coffee is their celebrity, but I have yet to try it.  So far, I've had their regular latte, which is a smooth and lightly aromatic.  It's not the strongest, nor the darkest, but it isn't acidic, and is very satisfying in both aroma and flavor.  Expensive for California (or the U.S., rather), I can see why one would cringe at paying almost $4 for a cup of coffee, but it's worth the experience!\n\nThe downsides of the Ferry Building location is the lack of seating and privacy if you're looking to have an intimate chat - but it's definitely the perfect place for a coffee to warm the soul in this always-chilly city.", "author": "Tammy L."}

In other words, no McFast Food, and no Starbucks.  That being said, I still need caffeine in order to function as a human being, and while out in San Francisco, I wanted to try something somewhat unique to the area.\n\nI got off on Embarcadero, because I feared that if I stayed on BART any longer, I'd end up in big scary Oakland.  And then I punched in \"coffee\" on Google maps, and began walking towards the coast before the results tabulated.  Before I knew it, I was at the Ferry Building, and Blue Bottle was practically in front of me.\n\nI must've been either ahead of the rush, or right after it, because there was no epic lines that others have cited; this was on a Monday morning at around 9 a.m. no less, so who knows, maybe I just got lucky.\n\nI'm superstitious about the caffeine content of fancy drinks, so I stuck with the drip coffee, which is made to order at Blue Bottle.  It takes a little bit longer, but you're assured a fresh cup of coffee that you know hasn't been sitting pre-brewed for god knows how long.  But it's delicious, and tastes smooth and not like nuclear earth piss that makes you jittery.  It's like what I expected Starbucks blonde roasts to taste like when it released.\n\nBut the waffles there; I had eaten not long before, but when I saw these big fat waffles emerging from their back, I knew I had to find some extra stomach space in order to try one of these bad boys out.  And despite the bursting seam feeling in the pants (at the waist, not the goods, perv...although now that you mention it, they were pretty good waffles), it was worth the extra gluttony.\n\nOverall a positive experience with Blue Bottle.

The pretty and friendly female barista with dreads and tattoos suggested I try the gibralter.\n\nThree little words: TRY THE GIBRALTAR. It's espresso heaven in a glass.\n\nNot on their menu, the gibraltar originated in SF with Blue Bottle owner James Freeman while he was testing cappuccinos at his Hayes Valley location in 2005. His roasting partner, Steve Ford, suggested they put it in a gibraltar glass, and hence, the drink was born.\n\nIt's 4.5 ounces of a cortado or double shot of espresso with a bit of steamed milk, the size of a cappuccino in Italy, without the milk drowning out the deliciously intense Blue Bottle Coffee. \n\nIt's like a shot glass of espresso, which is fun to down after a night of drinking shots of alcohol at a bar ; - )\n\nWhat really impressed me was the flavor of the coffee (I had previously thought that only Peets was strong enough for me.

Sluggish employees meandering in retrieval of customer orders. 12 people in line; one constant barista pulling shots, sweating under the unusual 75 degree SF day (cheers to you man, thanks for working with a sense of urgency), one downright slacker of a cashier/brewed coffee preparer (with hand on hip, sipping iced espresso, literally watching coffee drip, painful to be in line) with several other employees wandering around, either not interested in serving the customers in line or too busy to be bothered.  \n\n\nBlue Bottle has a reputation for a unique coffee experience and the concept is pretty great. Unfortunately, the overall feeling could best be described as aloof bordering on snobbish. The product is first class, the service mostly pretentious with an overall minimalist, coffee purist environment. I watched the cashier rebuff a customer for asking for their espresso on ice (again, 75 degrees in the city here and this appears to be exactly what YOU are sipping on!) why is this hard?

This is primarily for the reason that I prefer Philz drip over Blue Bottle and sometimes the drip coffee at Blue Bottle can be inconsistent depending on who is making it (sometimes it's a bit lighter than other times).

I thought to myself: those must be drinks that are more difficult to make and therefore they are getting theirs first. \n\nThen I started to notice that people who ordered after me AND had the same drink were getting theirs first. \n\nI won't jump to conspiracy theories as to why this was. It just was. \n\nI approached the gentleman and politely asked if my drink was ready and mentioned that I had been waiting some time. I was told that I was next....you know, behind the guy who ordered way after me and ALSO ordered a  latte. \n\nWhen I finally got my drink I again politely said to the gentleman helping me if there was an ordering system they adhered to because I had been put behind several people who ordered after me with similar drinks. Taking me for a moron and ignoring the fact that I already said that people (not 1 or 2 or 3....like 6 because I counted) with the same drinks got theirs ahead of me. He was not apologetic and stuck to his story that there is an order. \n\nThanks, guy. All I wanted was an apology for something that I had observed that seemed kinda wrong.

We ended up buying 2 half pounds of different coffees and are very much enjoying each of them. You could swear the Amaro Gayo Natural has been altered to have such a fruity flavor. Though not for everyone, I love this coffee.\n\nThe lattes are certainly pretty. Many of the pictures people have uploaded will attest to that.

While my friends and I were waiting in line, they have merchandise around the place. it's not an actual sit-down coffee place but more of a store front, you get your coffee and go. :) \n\nGot to the register after 20 minutes, I got the latte and my friend got the mocha latte around $3.50 each. It felt kind of like a lab experiment while watching them make our drinks with the different tools and equipment. Good techniques= good coffee. I like that they use organic milk and drip the coffee to get the best flavor. Then finish your drink with some type of artwork on top with the milk, neat. Not too hot when you first hold it in your hand, which is how good coffee should be because it's the perfect temperature for sipping. The taste is like no other, you can taste the coffee and the mixture of the milk is heaven. \n\nWill definitely go back if I'm in SF in the near future.", "author": "Jessica L."}

There are several locations (Hayes Valley, Ferry Building) and some restaurants will serve Blue Bottle Coffee as well.\n\nI've had their drip coffee, lattes, and hot chocolate which are all very good but my favorite drink has to be the New Orleans Style Iced Coffee. What I like is that you don't need to add any sugar. I've watched the baristas make it and they just have ice, coffee, and whole milk. That's it! Usually I would need to add 1 or 2 packets of coffee but not with Blue Bottle.\n\nThe only negative I have is that the prices are pretty steep. The Iced Coffee is $3.75 and the drink is not big. Their cheapest coffee drink is the Espresso, which is $2.50. The most expensive drink is the Caffe Mocha, which is $4.75. Yikes! I don't have Blue Bottle all the time so once in a while I'll treat myself.\n\nI define good coffee as coffee you don't need to add milk, cream, or sugar to make it taste good. That's the very definition of Blue Bottle. However adding any of these things will only enhance the flavor of their coffee.", "author": "Therese M."}

Everyone knows blue bottle is good because of the quality of the beans and the roasts.  The individual drips and their espresso machine there bring it to another level, and the clover creamery dairy makes each latte extra rich and smooth.  There's no hint of acidity or bitterness to any of their hand crafted drinks.\n\nEven more special is their baked goods, which are unique to Blue Bottle.  Today, I had the arborio rice cake, which is one of the most innovative pastry/desserts I've had in a while.  It looks like any other loaf from afar, but once you get a closer look, you'll appreciate the dried fruit bits and actual grains of arborio inside.  It's super moist, with extra texture from chopped nuts, and it has just the right balance of fruitiness and anise flavor.

I finally had a chance to try it today after bay to breakers.\n\nThe blue bottle coffee shop was pretty well organized. It was busy, but the line moved fairly quickly. I ordered 2 coffees: a regular drip coffee and a new orleans style iced coffee.\n\nThe first coffee came pretty quickly, but they forgot about the second one. I got it pretty quickly when I asked about it. So the service of this place is pretty swift; however, I noticed that people there didn't  really smile and seem very happy. In term of the drink, there's really nothing special. I have definitely had better coffee elsewhere in the bay area, so the place was overhyped.\n\nAll in all, if I wanted a quick cup of coffee from unhappy overworked employees, I could have gone to places like dunkin donut; or I could have gone to Starbucks if I wanted a nicer environment. Unfortunately the world doesn't need another brand like Starbucks or dunkin donut.", "author": "Chris F."}

The same friend who recommended Bluebottle also recommended Barefoot in San Jose.  Barefoot was a home run - sadly, Bluebottle was, at best, a double with nobody on base (more potential than substance).  \n\nI had asked for a recommendation for a smooth, light-roasted coffee with low acids.  The guy looked confused, but, if he was confused, that didn't manage to prevent him from talking at length about qualities I hadn't asked about (\"This one has subtle fruit flavors, whereas this one has hints of chocolate.\")  It sorta seemed like he was hoping I'd just be impressed by his knowledge, and quit asking questions.  Mostly, he just seemed annoyed by the question.  Ultimately, even though I had commented that I was considering the Peru Norte coffee, the employee strongly recommended I get the Misty Valley - so I took his recommendation.  \n\nThere is nothing low-acid or light-roasted about the Misty Valley.  In fact, I have a dark roast at my apartment that is lighter roasted and less acidic than the Misty Valley.  Maybe the dude just thought he'd be a dick and recommend a dark roast - but, honestly, it just seems like he got confused when presented with what should have been an easy question about their coffees. \n\nI'm imagining Chef Tom Colicchio from Top Chef saying, \"There is nothing wrong with a dark roasted coffee, but if you are going to give me a dark roast coffee, don't tell me it's a light roast.\"  \n\nOf course, the real problem is, I don't even think the coffee I was recommended was even that good.  Maybe their other coffees are better, but I'll hesitate to spend the money on a pound of their coffee again.\n\nAs for the famous drip coffee from Blue Bottle?  It was good - probably even above average.  Of course it is neat that they make your cup of coffee while you wait - nonetheless, it feels like they manage to earn their high reputation off of gimmickry instead of quality.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-02-06", "description": "Blue Bottle at the Ferry Building is a unique experience in high-end coffee.  On the one hand you have the pedigree of Blue Bottle while on the other you have the extreme volume demands of the Ferry Building.  To some extent these factors are at odds with each other: excellent coffee is something that requires both time and attention to detail.  Certainly this reality is no different than what is faced by the other vendors at the Ferry Building, however, and the quality of the Ferry vendors are generally top-notch despite the bustle the building receives.  \n\nFirst off, Blue Bottle overall isn't my favorite coffee roaster in the Bay area, but it definitely high quality and may suit the preferences of other peoples' palettes better than mine.  I prefer lighter roast coffee and, in general, Blue Bottle's coffees tend to be roasted a little darker than you'll find at Ritual, Four Barrel, or Barefoot.  Most of their offerings are a good solid medium-roast with a few lighter single-origins here and there.  As a result you'll find coffee with a lot of body and flavors that gravitate more towards earthy, cocoa notes than bright citrus or vegetable.  Most of the posted cupping notes are written emphasizing the emotions evoked by and histories of the coffee more than specific flavor notes.  This is unusual in the SF scene and is endearing, but it can make choosing beans that match your taste preferences more challenging than it should be.  BB also seems to heavily favor its blends, which are very popular throughout the city, over its single-origin beans.  The shop has two 'sides' pulling different coffees at the same time: the shop's blend, Hayes Valley, is up front while a rotating single-origin espresso is available around the corner.  Having the choice between the two is really neat but I think most of the crowds miss the distinction and go to whichever side they notice first (or whichever has the shorter line).  It's a shame because when Blue Bottle gets single-origin right it's a beautiful thing and I do think there's a missed opportunity for coffee education in their minimalist approach.\n\nThe Ferry Building used to pull a different espresso, which I greatly preferred over the current Hayes Valley blend.  Hayes was made for the location in Hayes Valley for which it is named.  When it's at its best it's got great chocolate, anise, and licorice notes that pair well with their savory pastries such as a rosemary shortbread and sesame absinthe cookie.  When it's not so great it gets bitter, woody, metallic, and musty.  The baristas at the Ferry Building are excellent, but they face a big challenge keeping up with volume and pace of the shop.  Sometimes things don't get as dialed in as they should, so the coffee doesn't always live up to its potential.\n\nEnvironmentally the Ferry Building location is sparse.  There's very little seating, although a spot is almost always available since most patrons are passing through to other destinations. The clientele is around 1/3 tourists, 1/3 Ferry commuter regulars, and 1/3 coffee geeks.\n\nIf you're at the Ferry Building, I highly recommend checking this location out.  If you're looking for the best BB experience, you may be better off getting the weekend brunch at the Mint Plaza location, which suffers from fewer of the limitations the FB faces and has some fantastic grub to boot.\n\nI would give the Ferry Building location a 3.5 star rating if I could.", "author": "Dan C."}

To cut to the chase: possibly the best cup of drip coffee I've ever been served.\n\nI've been ordering beans from Blue Bottle by mail when I remember (they only ship on Mondays), and I forgot, so I went to the Tuesday farmer's market to get some beans.\n\nThey sell beans by the half pound here. If you buy a full pound, you get a free cup of coffee. So I wanted to buy two half pounds. Problem is, I brew coffee at home via french press, and by the time I got to Blue Bottle (around 1:00 p.m.), they had one half pound of their Yirg (good for french press) and nothing else but various espresso conconctions like Retrofit. After asking if I had, maybe, a moka pot (I don't), the woman did the only responsible thing and told me, no, none of these other coffees are what you're looking for. That is already respectable, but then she gave me the free cup of coffee anyhow. That's downright decent.\n\nAnd the coffee was sublime. I've heard good things about their espresso drinks, and I intend to come back next week to try that too, but it is on the strength of just the drip coffee that I am giving this five stars.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-04-30", "description": "Decent coffee but I think it's more hype than anything else. People seemed so mesmerized by the individual filtered coffee that they seem to forget they're paying more for the display than anything else. $3.50 for a New Orleans style ice coffee that comes in child's size cup, though probably their best item, is a bit much. Does anyone know if they roast their beans on site?", "author": "Tim S."}

I don't get it, what about those that can't have sugar, what about customer service??? Coffee was nothing special...will go to Philz now, seems 4 people told me yesterday how good the coffee is...hmmmm bet they have sugar substitutes!", "author": "Honest in SF H."}

This is definitely great coffee though, and worth the wait.  The thing is, I get why each cup is made individually, but why oh why does each serving of milk have to be made individually?  Seriously, couldn't they steam a pot of milk just like they do at Peet's?  And yes, it's quite amazing that their baristas are actually slow too, it's not just the process, it's that they've somehow been hired from the land of very slow people.  LOVE the coffee though.", "author": "E C."}

I couldn't help but admire the girl behind the little stand, with hands so encrusted in coffee I wondered how she ever got them clean. She poured one of the most amazing iced lattes I've had, and in a mass rarity I didn't want a bit of sugar. Unfortunately it's hard to get to and since my friend was leading I have No idea where this coffee stand is.", "author": "Maria P."}

I've never waited so long for a cappuccino. I don't think the workers understand the concept of 'efficiency'. The guy would stop to add beans to the grinder, and then a few minutes later add a little more beans- you get the picture. Also, at the Farmers' Market they ran out of beans (!) although it looked like they had some bagged for sale. Again, great coffee, but then it's only coffee.", "author": "Charles S."}

Can be a long wait even when there's only a couple of people waiting but I already know that in advance so can't really complain about it. My one criticism would be that once late in the day I got a cup & after it was made was told they were out of creamer - for me that makes coffee undrinkable.", "author": "Fidel M."}

The only issue that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is that I'm a regular at one of their customers in San Jose that uses their beans. They do a better job with Blue Bottle's espresso.", "author": "Coffee C."}
