Now that I'm older, I definitely prefer a caffeine kick rather than a sugar rush. Between Peets and Starbucks, I don't really have a personal opinion on the quality of their beans but I would say that since I prefer drinking matcha lattes that I like Peets far better. The matcha powder they use is pure and without any added sugars unlike Starbucks because I don't really like to get my extra calories through drinks anyways. Not sure if this is a seasonal drink as well, but I've also enjoyed the Golden milk lattes although those are mostly syrup aside from the turmeric powder haha. I guess what I like about Peets is that they certainly put in a lot of thought with experimenting with their drink options from the different spices used in their lattes to their fog drinks. They get creative but not outrageous the way that Starbucks can get sometimes..\n\nThis particular location is in the ferry building so it can have busy hours and so service can feel rushed and pressed for time but I've always had a good experience here! The employees are very pleasant and they work fast. Today I ordered a matcha and thet even asked if I wanted to have the remaining drink poured in a sample cup since it was more than they expected. Small gesture but totally appreciated :)\n\nI also prefer the rewards system at Peets since it's based on check ins rather than how much money you spend. If you have down time this is a great place to come by and just hang out while enjoying a beverage!", "author": "Samantha C."}

It is definitely my choice too, as some of you have witnessed from my Review of the day back in 2009, which seems like a long time ago. \n\nBut on February 7th, this day belongs to Peet's. Because the Berkeley franchise is having the Golden State Warrior's blend. And by promoting the limited edition blend, this Peet's location invited Javale McGee and Kelenna Azabuike from the Warriors in making an appearance by working there and signing autographs. \n\nIn addition to meeting the two Warriors, I also bought a bag of the Warrior's ground. For $16.95, the blend has a bold and smooth Kenyan and Guinea flavor. Both countries produced some of the better tasting coffee in the world. Surely the Warriors picked a pair of great blends and combination. \n\nAlso with my coffee bean purchase, I also got a green tea latte for a discounted cost. Peet's is best known for the coffee, they also make some outstanding teas too. And the green tea latte is legit. I would never drink that blended drink from anywhere else. \n\nThe Warriors blend is only available until the end of February at all locations, though I am not so certain and they may carry longer than the initial ending.\n\nI hope Yelp do not remove my Review of Day from Blue Bottle from 2009. \"It is just one day, damn it!\"", "author": "Matt G."}

Wish I had checked in before I ordered because the discount was for my exact purchase! \n\nYou've got 3 locations within this one building at the pier to fuel your coffee addiction : Peet's, Blue Bottle, and Starbucks. I indulged in the pretentiousness that is Blue Bottle earlier this month, so decided to try the other local guy out. \n\nBusy location given its touristy housing at the pier, but well managed and the line went quickly. \n\nI ordered a small Mayan Mocha, a warm seasonal drink. It was nicely spiced with i-couldn't-tell-what .. maybe cinnamon and something hot, like chili? I almost tasted a hint of anise, and I hate anise, but anise or not, it was nice. I obliged with the whipped cream, because duh, and sprinkled more cinnamon on top, because Fall. \n\nMy boyfriend had their cold brew, and loved it way more than Blue Bottle's. Just because it's cold brew doesn't mean it has to be bitter rocket fuel, BB; Peet's is sweetly on point. \n\nI indulged in a Florentine cookie because 1- I love those things, and 2- they looked craftily done (not your average crumble of almond, but instead slivered almonds beautifully attached atop chocolate).

The gentleman behind the counter really didn't look like he wanted to make another drink so I think he was pleasantly surprised when all I asked for was the cookie. \n\nAs he was ringing me up, he realized he no longer had a till in either register so he gave it to me for free!

Well, the only way to find out is...give Peet's a try.\n\nI like Starbucks' caramel frappuccino very much, and that's about the only thing I order from them.  But I wanted a change from that same-o, same-o usual beverage.  My last trip to a Starbucks was just okay - nothing to write home to mom about.  The caramel frappuccino no longer gave me that wow factor and I just wasn't feeling it.\n\nEarlier this month, and every time, my husband and I have ridden the ferry to SF, we have made it a habit of coming to this Peet's before we board the ferry to head back home to Alameda.  I order the medium pumpkin freddo and he orders the medium caramel latte.  Having the pumpkin freddo at least five times, I notice it has a stronger taste and is definitely better than Starbucks.  Alas, the pumpkin freddo is only a seasonal beverage.  The more we visited Peet's, the more it was an enjoyable experience.  \n\nYesterday I was a solo act (hubby did not come along) and stopped at this Peet's.  Instead of ordering the same beverage, I decided to try the chocolate caramel swirl freddo.  Which was better - Peet's chocolate caramel swirl freddo or Starbucks' caramel frappuccino?  Peet's beverage was stronger and more flavorful than Starbucks.  I am now convinced...lol.\n\nNo more visit to Starbucks.  This Peet's is my to go place when I'm in SF Embarcadero area, and my friend was right about the taste of their beverage.

We were in front in the line in no time at all and had our coffee within minutes of stepping foot in the store. \n\nMy Iced non-fat latte was fantastic and the service was not only efficient, each member we came into contact with was very friendly. The only reason why I had to dock 1/2 a star is because we were rung up at the cash register to the far left of the store and a distance away from the desserts they had displayed. Without looking, we ordered a chocolate chip cookie that was given to us right after we completed the transaction.\n\nWhen we were waiting for our drinks by the dessert counter, we noticed about a dozen flies all over the food. All over the stack of cookies that the cashier just pulled our cookie from. We both looked at each other and knew we would NOT eat that cookie we just paid for after seeing that. It was disgusting. While we got through the line quickly, a line continued to build behind us and neither of us felt like jumping back in line asking for a refund. So...we threw the cookie away without even taking one bite. What a waste of money! \n\nI think Peet's should consider getting glass domes to cover the food they serve.

I'm just not that into you anymore.\n\nAfter 25 years of being a Peet's customer, today I ended my relationship with the vendor.   Back then, getting quality coffee, roasted by artisans who cared about their craft was difficult.  Peet's was different.  Today, it's easy, particularly in San Francisco, to find finely roasted beans served in an environment where you can tell people care about their customers.  Peet's in the Ferry Building is not that place.\n\nI've noticed each time I stopped by the Ferry Building location, there was something a bit off with the Peet's experience.  One time, they served coffee from the end of the urn, bitter and old tasting.  When I commented on it, they seemed to blame my taste buds for the flaw, rather than their old coffee.  Another time, the floor was filthy and when I brought it to to their attention, they seemed put out to clean their store.\n\nToday, thanks to \"Johnny\" and \"Jessica\" (10/6/11) in the Ferry Building, I say to Peet's:  I've had enough.  I've had enough of the hipper-than-thou attitude.  I've had enough of the mediocre coffee, prepared as a labor of labor, rather than a labor of love.  \n\nBy the way, if you are going there for the Wi-fi, prepare to be disappointed.  It only works about 50% of the time and the employees shrug it off, saying that there's nothing that can be done about it.\n\nThere's a Blue Bottle Coffee about 30 seconds' walk from this Peet's.

The \"barista\" was so rushed and careless he kept spilling everyone's coffee. They ran out of pumpkin spice, they ran out of chocolate sauce, they pushed drinks out that weren't finished, they served the coffee cold. Pretty aweful! Never going back there again.

There was a substantial amount of chocolate in it, which I can always appreciate. I got my coffee in a ceramic mug and sat by the window, watching giant ships roll on by. I was even a little tempted to hop on the ferry to Sausalito (I've never been there before). It was too cold out though and I didn't have a thick enough jacket on, so I just sipped my coffee and watched all of the morning commuters waiting for their ferry. \nThis Peet's is a great place to people watch and get a nice view of the water and bay bridge.

I gave my order and then went to go wait for my vanilla soy latte to be made.\n\nI noticed one of my co-workers repeating his name over and over to the cashier.\n\n\"Samarjit. No, it's Samarjit. No, it's Samarjit. Sam...Ar....jit. No, it's Samarjit.\"\n\nThe line is getting longer. People are looking to see what the hold up is.\n\n\"Samarjit. Let me spell it. S as in Sam...A as in...\" \n\nImmediately, my other co-worker comes to the rescue and says, \"His name is SAM\" and pulls him away.\n\nSamarjit starts arguing in Hindi, while my other co-worker argues back to him in English.\n\nI immediately feign exaggerated interest in the display of mugs and gift sets.\n\nThe gift sets actually do look very cool for that Peet's coffee lover on your Holiday list.\n\nMy name is called and I pick up my latte. \n\nI take a sip. Awww...it's not the best coffee, but always consistent and good.\n\n\"Sam's\" name is called. I hear him grumble, \"That's not my name.\"\n\nI hear my other co-worker mumble back. \"It is now. Live with it.\"\n\nOVERALL: Peet's is always consistent, not stellar, but definitely good. After studying the gift selection, I concluded that a Peet's gift card is the best way to go.

You think we should get some Peet's?\"\n\nHe was walking really fast and slightly sweating. He also didn't wait for his daughter to respond as he pushed her quickly into the meth lab, I mean Peet's.\n\nThat's what we need, more caffeinated children. I bet his daughter is the same girl I keep hearing scream bloody murder from the after school program playground on Mission St. on my way to the bus station. Every time I hear it my rectum crawls into my throat, which is also what happens when I drink coffee.\n\nNext time I see him I'm going to offer to watch his child while he gets his Peet's fix. While he's pouring in all the accoutrement I'll quickly leash the kid and put a carrot stick in her mouth.

That's strong coffee.  \n\nAs a whole, I think the people working at Peet's are friendlier and more knowledgeable than Starbuck's.

I've even met the old guy - it was a while back when I was working for Peets. \n\nI can say that as a company they are all about educating the staff on Coffee, Tea and everything in between. An employee or a Peetnik as they call them is heavily educated on the coffee industry, tasting, roasting, brewing - you name it they'll teach it to you. You'll learn to taste coffee like it's wine - you'll learn how to tell where in the world the beans were grown by the taste of the brew. It's one thing that I do not think Starbucks invests time into.\n\nThe funny thing is - Starbucks would not exist if it was not for Peet's - their business model was copied from the Peet's in Berkeley, they even sold Peet's coffee while they learned how to roast their own beans - from Peet's!! There was even a contract that kept the two companies from competing - that ended in 1993 or so, and that's when they started popping up on every street corner.....\n\nFunny thing, the now CEO of Peet's is one of the original founders of Starbucks, he didn't like the direction they were moving, jumped ship and bought Peet's.\n\nIt's a great company, they hire the best people and they are very knowledgeable when it comes to their business.

I was there to meet a friend who was coming from Danville.\n\nI ordered my coffee \"for here\" - a french press - paid for it, turned around, and there was my friend.  The person who had waited on me had turned her register over to someone else who was now serving someone.  I asked the original server - who looked all of 18 years old - if I could just add to my order and she said no, I would have to stand in line all over again.  I looked behind me and there were TWENTY people in line.  WTF?  30 seconds after I order I can't add to my order?\n\nI then decided to ignore her and waited for the new person at the register to finish with the people she was serving (the same people who had been behind me in line for those 10 minutes), explained that I would like to add to my order, and she took my order for my friend.  I asked for my friend's coffee \"for here\" but she put it into a paper cup.  We didn't say anything.\n\nSo, about five minutes have passed, and I look to the side and JUST NOW, my original server is grinding the coffee for my press pot.  What exactly had she been doing since I ordered it?  And press pots take something like 3-5 minutes to steep, so it was going to be another long wait.\n\nWhen she finally gave it to me, she said they were out of ceramic cups and would I take it in a paper cup?  I thought to myself \"as opposed to what, chugging it out of the press pot?\"  So I said paper would be fine.  Then I asked another server for a ceramic cup and he went and got one for me.  \n\nWe had difficulty finding a place to sit outside, there are big tables, which are very nice, that seat probably 10 people each, but they were very messy, covered in old coffee-stained newspapers, and with people sitting there eating Chinese food out of take-out containers, with their backpacks occupying most of  the empty seats, and no way to squeeze in to the seats that were vacant.  \n\nThe Ferry Building is a beautiful space, and Peet's is situated at the back near the bay, with full-length glass walls, and it would be a really great experience were it not for the long wait, poor service, dirty tables, and massive crowds.\n\nOh, there was a sign that they had free wifi, you could ask for a password for two hours free.", "author": "Alexandra D."}

Their coffee drinks are superior to the rest of the Peets, and their staff seem more the collegiate type, instead of the in a secret society with bike messengers. And it's just a different calming world down there. I work at Mission and Spear with a 2 starbucks within stones throw. But I walk that walk down there so I can drink my coffee among home boutiques, ferry riders, and senior citizens. It's definitely made me an addict. No that was my job. Okay, this is just the place that makes my left leg shake uncontrollable. To the point I think I might hurt myself if I had to pee, which I do. What am I supposed to do? Oh God, that's not too much information is it?", "author": "Jean W."}

Because it's at the Ferry Building, you can wind up in a line even at a non-rush hour because a literal boatload of people might decide to satisfy their latte fix.", "author": "Timothy O."}

I am well aware that it is busy during morning rush hour, but shouldn't all drinks be of the same priority? Overall, OK coffee, disappointing service.", "author": "CHERiE Y."}

Something you will be wearing if you don't jump on the clue-bus, lady!  Other times it's better but this is not my favorite Peet's--lacks the intimacy.  It could be in a train station lobby.

It was sunny and  gorgeous - a short reprieve from the rainy season.  My two friends and I (all coffee lovers) stopped into Peets for a quick, afternoon cup of coffee and within 15 minutes, all felt like puking and had to go home.  The nausea and stomach upset lasted well into the night and none of us could fall asleep until 3am.

The staff works fast and is pretty friendly.  My Mocha and my friend's white chocolate mocha was made superbly.  My friend said honey oat bran muffin was freaking awesome and full of goodness. Not too sweet nor grainy, just right.  Like every coffee place I go to I get a chocolate croissant. Well the one Peet's has isn't that great. Hence only 4 stars.  Lost of croissant, but not fluffy like another place.  Next time I'll tempt fate with something different.", "author": "Chris G."}

I've been drinking coffee since I was 5 when I used to sit with my mom, aunts and grandma in the kitchen while they drank coffee, smoked cigs (except ma) and chatted. I don't use cream or sugar anymore, unless the coffee is really crappy or has booze in it. Peet's is my place. Love no coffee like it. Major Dickasons on the board? I'm having a great day. The ONLY problem is ..... and you all know it.....they are so freakin slow. And you can't even be mad about it. (Ok, I am). And every Peet's is this way. EVERY ONE OF 'EM. I think it's in their business plan. Take forF____cking ever to serve 'em and people will love it. Ok, I do. I love it in spite of the wait. And the problem is I really LIKE the workers! Good folks! I'm sure the only reason I have a problem with it is because it makes me late for work every morning (and no I won't get up earlier. I need my beauty sleep). That's it. Go to Peet's.
